False prophets flatter people in their sins, because they love to be flattered; and they speak smoothly to their prophets, that their prophets may speak smoothly to them. God promises that they should return after seventy years were accomplished. By this it appears, that the seventy years of the captivity are not to be reckoned from the last captivity, but the first. It will be the bringing to pass of God's good word to them. This shall form God's purposes. We often do not know our own minds, but the Lord is never at an uncertainty. We are sometimes ready to fear that God's designs are all against us; but as to his own people, even that which seems evil, is for good. He will give them, not the expectations of their fears, or the expectations of their fancies, but the expectations of their faith; the end he has promised, which will be the best for them. When the Lord pours out an especial spirit of prayer, it is a good sign that he is coming toward us in mercy. Promises are given to quicken and encourage prayer. He never said, Seek ye me in vain. Those who remained at Jerusalem would be utterly destroyed, notwithstanding what the false prophets said to the contrary. The reason has often been given, and it justifies the eternal ruin of impenitent sinners; Because they have not hearkened to my words; I called, but they refused.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/29.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Your prophets and your diviners - The evils from which the people had suffered so cruelly at home followed them in their exile.<p>Dreams which ye cause to be dreamed - As long as there was a market for dreams, so long there would be plenty of impostors to supply them. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/29.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. your dreams which ye caused to be dreamed&#8212;The Latin adage says, "The people wish to be deceived, so let them be deceived." Not mere credulity misleads men, but their own perverse "love of darkness rather than light." It was not priests who originated priestcraft, but the people's own morbid appetite to be deceived; for example, Aaron and the golden calf (Ex 32:1-4). So the Jews caused or made the prophets to tell them encouraging dreams (Jer 23:25, 26; Ec 5:7; Zec 10:2; Joh 3:19-21).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/29.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The Lord knows that you have a company of false prophets that tell you other things, and promise you a sudden return out of your captivity, pretending to know it by revelation from God, or by divination, &c., or to have it discovered to them in dreams.

False teachers and guides of people’s souls are the greatest plague can befall a nation, people from them expecting to hear the mind of God, and for the most part people are accessory to their own ruin in them. It can indeed hardly be imagined what other temptation persons whose office it is to reveal the mind of God should have to do otherwise, but the humouring and pleasing of a corrupt people, who through their fondness of their lusts are not patient of sound doctrine; so as though the church of God hath in all ages been troubled with dreamers, yet it is a wicked people that causeth them to dream. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/29.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel,....

The spirit of discontent thus excited must have exercised an injurious influence on the fortunes of the captives, and could not fail to frustrate the aim which the chastisement inflicted by God was designed to work out, namely, the moral advancement of the people. Therefore Jeremiah makes use of an opportunity furnished by an embassy sent by King Zedekiah to Babel, to address a letter to the exiles, exhorting them to yield with submission to the lot God had assigned to them. He counsels them to prepare, by establishing their households there, for a long sojourn in Babel, and to seek the welfare of that country as the necessary condition of their own. They must not let themselves be deceived by the false prophets' idle promises of a speedy return, since God will not bring them back and fulfil His glorious promises till after seventy years have passed (<a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-4.htm">Jeremiah 29:4-14</a>). Then he tells them that sore judgments are yet in store for King Zedekiah and such as have been left in the land (<a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-15.htm">Jeremiah 29:15-20</a>); and declares that some of their false prophets shall perish miserably (<a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-21.htm">Jeremiah 29:21-32</a>).<p>Heading and Introduction. - The following circular is connected, in point of outward form, with the preceding discourses against the false prophets in Jerusalem by means of the words: "And these are the words of the letter," etc. The words of the letter, i.e., the main contents of the letter, since it was not transcribed, but given in substance. "Which the prophet Jeremiah sent from Jerusalem unto the residue of the elders of the captives, and to the priests and prophets, and to the whole people, which Nebuchadnezzar had carried away from Jerusalem to Babylon." "The residue of the elders," Hitz. and Graf understand of those elders who were not at the same time priests or prophets. On this Ng. pronounces: "It is impossible that they can be right, for then 'the residue of the elders of the captivity' must have stood after the priests and prophets." And though we hear of elders of the priests, there is no trace in the O.T. of elders of the prophets. Besides, the elders, whenever they are mentioned along with the priests, are universally the elders of the people. Thus must we understand the expression here also. "The residue of the elders" can only be the remaining, i.e., still surviving, elders of the exiles, as &#1497;&#1514;&#1512; is used also in <a href="/jeremiah/39-9.htm">Jeremiah 39:9</a> for those still in life. But there is no foundation for the assumption by means of which Gr. seeks to support his interpretation, namely, that the place of elders that died was immediately filled by new appointments, so that the council of the elders must always have been regarded as a whole, and could not come to be a residue or remnant. Jeremiah could not possibly have assumed the existence of such an organized governing authority, since in this very letter he exhorts them to set about the establishment of regular system in their affairs. The date given in <a href="/jeremiah/29-2.htm">Jeremiah 29:2</a> : "after that Jechoniah the king, and the sovereign lady, and the courtiers, the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, the workmen and smiths, were gone away from Jerusalem," points to the beginning of Zedekiah's reign, to the first or second year of it. With this the advice given to the captives in the letter harmonizes well, namely, the counsel to build houses, plant gardens, etc.; since this makes it clear that they had not been long there. The despatch of this letter is usually referred to the fourth year of Zedekiah's reign, because in <a href="/jeremiah/28-1.htm">Jeremiah 28:1</a> this year is specified. But the connection in point of matter between the present chapter and <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/28.htm">Jeremiah 28</a> does not necessarily imply their contemporaneousness, although that is perfectly possible; and the fact that, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-59.htm">Jeremiah 51:59</a>, Zedekiah himself undertook a journey to Babylon in the fourth year of his reign, does not exclude the possibility of an embassy thither in the same year. The going away from Jerusalem is the emigration to Babylon; cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-1.htm">Jeremiah 24:1</a>, <a href="/2_kings/24-15.htm">2 Kings 24:15</a>. &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1512;&#1492;, the queen-mother, see on <a href="/jeremiah/13-18.htm">Jeremiah 13:18</a>. &#1505;&#1512;&#1497;&#1505;&#1497;&#1501; are the officials of the court; not necessarily eunuchs. Both words are joined to the king, because these stood in closest relations to him. Then follows without copula the second class of emigrants, the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, i.e., the heads of the tribes, septs, and families of the nation. The artisans form the third class. This disposes of the objections raised by Mov. and Hitz. against the genuineness of the words "princes of Judah and Jerusalem," their objections being based on the false assumption that these words were an exposition of "courtiers." Cf. against this, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/24-15.htm">2 Kings 24:15</a>, where along with the &#1505;&#1512;&#1497;&#1505;&#1497;&#1501; the heads of tribes and families are comprehended under the head of &#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497; &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;. <a href="/jeremiah/29-3.htm">Jeremiah 29:3</a>. "By the hand" of Elasah is dependent on "sent," <a href="/jeremiah/29-1.htm">Jeremiah 29:1</a>. The men by whom Jeremiah sent the letter to Babylon are not further known. Shaphan is perhaps the same who is mentioned in <a href="/jeremiah/26-24.htm">Jeremiah 26:24</a>. We have no information as to the aim of the embassy. </body></html>
