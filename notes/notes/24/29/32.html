Lying was bad; lying to the people of the Lord, to delude them into a false hope, was worse; but pretending to rest their own lies upon the God of truth, was worst of all. They flattered others in their sins, because they could not reprove them without condemning themselves. The most secret sins are known to God; and there is a day coming when he will bring to light all the hidden works of darkness. Shemaiah urges the priests to persecute Jeremiah. Their hearts are wretchedly hardened who justify doing mischief by having power to do it. They were in a miserable thraldom for mocking the messengers of the Lord, and misusing his prophets; yet in their distress they trespass still more against the Lord. Afflictions will not of themselves cure men of their sins, unless the grace of God works with them. Those who slight the blessings, deserve to lose the benefit of God's word, like Shemaiah. The accusations against many active Christians in all ages, amount to no more than this, that they earnestly counsel men to attend to their true interest and duties, and to wait for the performance of God's promises in his appointed way.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/29.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This captivity is long - Rather, It is long.

As to Zephaniah ben Maaseiah, see at <a href="/jeremiah/21-1.htm">Jeremiah 21:1</a>. - In <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-26.htm">Jeremiah 29:26-28</a> follows the main substance of the letter: "Jahveh hath set thee to be priest in the stead of the priest Jehoiada, that there should be officers in the house of Jahveh for every man that is mad and prophesieth, that thou shouldest put him in the stocks and in neck-irons. <a href="/jeremiah/29-27.htm">Jeremiah 29:27</a>. And, now, why hast thou not restrained Jeremiah of Anathoth, that prophesieth to you? <a href="/jeremiah/29-28.htm">Jeremiah 29:28</a>. For therefore hath he sent to us to Babylon (a letter) to the effect: It will last long; build houses and dwell (therein), and plant gardens and eat the fruit of them." Zephaniah occupied, acc. to <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-26.htm">Jeremiah 29:26</a>, the post of a chief officer of the temple, was a chief warden, as Pashur had been before him, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-1.htm">Jeremiah 21:1</a>, who had charge of the police regulations of the temple.<p>In the stead of the priest Jehoiada. These words Grot., Hitz., and Gr. refer to the high priest Jehoiada under King Joash, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/11-18.htm">2 Kings 11:18</a>, who set up officers (&#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;) over the temple. But this view cannot be reconciled with the words of the text: "Jahveh hath set thee to be priest in Jehoiada's stead, that there should be officers;" since from these ambiguous words, Zephaniah filled the same post as Jehoiada had done, and was his successor in office. The other well-known Jehoiada was high priest, who appointed officers; Zephaniah, on the other hand was only "the second priest," and as such had charge of the temple arrangements and of public order there. Nor is there any hint here or elsewhere that Zephaniah was the immediate successor of Pashur in this office, nor any indication to make it unlikely that Jehoiada held the post after Pashur and that Zedekiah succeeded him. The plural "officers" is general: that at all times there should be officers. "For every man that is mad an prophesieth." &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1490;&#1468;&#1506;, the deranged or mad person, is here closely associated with &#1502;&#1514;&#1504;&#1489;&#1468;&#1488;, him that bears himself as prophet. The former word is used in the evil sense of the apparently deranged behaviour of the man on whom the Spirit of God has laid hold, <a href="/2_kings/9-11.htm">2 Kings 9:11</a>; <a href="/hosea/9-7.htm">Hosea 9:7</a>. The idea is not: for (or against) every prophet, but: for every madman that plays the prophet. The temple, i.e., the outer court of the temple, was the usual place for prophets to take their stand. Shemaiah accordingly means that it was the duty of the chief warden of the temple to repress attempts to speak in the temple on the part of pretended prophets, by putting such persons in stocks and irons. As to &#1502;&#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1499;&#1514;, see on <a href="/jeremiah/20-2.htm">Jeremiah 20:2</a>. &#1510;&#1497;&#1504;&#1511; is &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0; &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;.. It certainly does not mean prison after &#1510;&#1504;&#1511;, in Samaritan  equals  clausit; but apparently neck-irons after Arab. zna&#770;q, necklace, ring. Since both words are used together here, and since the meaning is apparently that Jeremiah should be put into both instruments at once, Hitz. conjectures that both together were needed to make the stocks complete, but that each had its own proper name, because it was possible to fix in the neck, leaving hands and feet free, or conversely, as in <a href="/jeremiah/20-2.htm">Jeremiah 20:2</a>. -  &#1490;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;, rebuke, check by threats, restrain, cf. <a href="/ruth/2-16.htm">Ruth 2:16</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/malachi/3-11.htm">Malachi 3:11</a>, etc. "For therefore," sc. just because thou hast not restrained him from prophesying he has sent to Babylon. &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495; with &#1500;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; following, send to say, means: to send a message or letter as follows. &#1500;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; &#1488;&#1512;&#1499;&#1492; &#1492;&#1497;&#1488; Hitz. renders: for he thought: it (Babylon) is far away; Jeremiah's meaning being, that in Jerusalem they would know nothing about his letter he was sending to Babylon. But such a hidden purpose is utterly foreign to the character of the prophet. He had publicly predicted in Jerusalem the long seventy years' duration of the exile; and it was not likely to occur to him to wish to make a secret of the letter of like import which he sent to Babylon. Besides, Hitz.'s interpretation is forced. Since there is no &#1500;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; before &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; &#1489;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, the &#1500;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; before &#1488;&#1512;&#1499;&#1492; can only be introductory to the contents of the letter. For &#1488;&#1512;&#1498; used of duration in time, cf. <a href="/2_samuel/3-1.htm">2 Samuel 3:1</a>; <a href="/job/11-9.htm">Job 11:9</a>. "Long-lasting it is," sc. your sojourn in Babylon. These words give the burden of his prophecy, that on which he founded his counsel: build houses, etc.</body></html>
