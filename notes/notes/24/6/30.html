Sacrifice and incense were to direct them to a Mediator; but when offered to purchase a license to go on in sin, they provoke God. The sins of God's professing people make them an easy prey to their enemies. They dare not show themselves. Saints may rejoice in hope of God's mercies, though they see them only in the promise: sinners must mourn for fear of God's judgments, though they see them only in the threatenings. They are the worst of revolters, and are all corrupters. Sinners soon become tempters. They are compared to ore supposed to have good metal in it, but which proves all dross. Nothing will prevail to part between them and their sins. Reprobate silver shall they be called, useless and worthless. When warnings, corrections, rebukes, and all means of grace, leave men unrenewed, they will be left, as rejected of God, to everlasting misery. Let us pray, then, that we may be refined by the Lord, as silver is refined.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Reprobate - See the margin; not really silver, but the dross.<p>The Lord hath rejected them - This then is the end. The smelter is God's prophet: the bellows the breath of inspiration: the flux his earnestness in preaching. But in vain does the fervour of prophecy essay to melt the hearts of the people. They are so utterly corrupt, that no particle even of pure metal can be found in them. All the refiner's art is in vain. They have rejected all God's gifts and motives for their repentance, and therefore Yahweh has rejected them as an alloy too utterly adulterate to repay the refiner's toil. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>30.

"Thus hath Jahveh said: Behold, a people cometh from the land of the north, and a great nation raises itself from the furthermost sides of the earth. <a href="/jeremiah/6-23.htm">Jeremiah 6:23</a>. Bows and javelins they bear; cruel it is, and they have no mercy; their voice roareth like the sea; and on horses they ride, equipped as a man for the war against thee, daughter of Zion. <a href="/jeremiah/6-24.htm">Jeremiah 6:24</a>. We heard the rumour thereof: weak are our hands: anguish hath taken hold of us, and pain, as of a woman in travail. <a href="/jeremiah/6-25.htm">Jeremiah 6:25</a>. Go not forth into the field, and in the way walk not; for a sword hath the enemy, fear is all around. <a href="/jeremiah/6-26.htm">Jeremiah 6:26</a>. O daughter of my people, gird thee with sackcloth, and besprinkle thee with ashes; make mourning for an only son, butter lamentation: for suddenly shall the spoiler come upon us. <a href="/jeremiah/6-27.htm">Jeremiah 6:27</a>. For a trier have I set thee among my people as a strong tower, that thou mightest know and try their way. <a href="/jeremiah/6-28.htm">Jeremiah 6:28</a>. They are all revolters of revolters; go about as slanderers; brass and iron; they are all dealing corruptingly. <a href="/jeremiah/6-29.htm">Jeremiah 6:29</a>. Burned are the bellows by the fire, at an end is the lead; in vain they melt and melt; and wicked ones are not separated. <a href="/jeremiah/6-30.htm">Jeremiah 6:30</a>. Rejected silver they call them, for Jahveh hath rejected them."<p>In <a href="/jeremiah/6-22.htm">Jeremiah 6:22</a> the stumbling-blocks of <a href="/jeremiah/6-21.htm">Jeremiah 6:21</a> are explained. At the end of this discourse yet again the invasion of the enemy from the far north is announced, cf. <a href="/jeremiah/4-13.htm">Jeremiah 4:13</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-15.htm">Jeremiah 5:15</a>, and its terribleness is portrayed with new colours. The farther the land is from which the enemy comes, the more strange and terrible he appears to the imagination. The farthest (hindmost) sides of the earth (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/25-32.htm">Jeremiah 25:32</a>) is only a heightening of the idea: land of the north, or of the far distance (<a href="/jeremiah/5-15.htm">Jeremiah 5:15</a>); in other words, the far uttermost north (cf. <a href="/isaiah/14-13.htm">Isaiah 14:13</a>). In this notice of their home, Hitz. finds a proof that the enemies were the Scythians, not the Chaldeans; since, acc. to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-6.htm">Ezekiel 38:6</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-15.htm">Ezekiel 38:15</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-2.htm">Ezekiel 39:2</a>, Gog, i.e., The Scythians, come "from the sides of the north." But "sides of the earth" is not a geographical term for any particular northern country, but only for very remote lands; and that the Chaldeans were reckoned as falling within this term, is shown by the passage <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-8.htm">Jeremiah 31:8</a>, according to which Israel is to be gathered again from the land of the north and from the sides of the earth. Here any connection with Scythia in "sides of the earth" is not to be thought of, since prophecy knows nothing of a captivity of Israel in Scythia, but regards Assur and Babylon alone as the lands of the exile of Israelites and Jews. As weapons of the enemy then are mentioned bows (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/4-29.htm">Jeremiah 4:29</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/5-16.htm">Jeremiah 5:16</a>), and the javelin or lance (&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1503;, not shield; see on <a href="/1_samuel/17-6.htm">1 Samuel 17:6</a>). It is cruel, knows no pity, and is so numerous and powerful, that its voice, i.e., the tumult of its approach, is like the roaring of the sea; cf. <a href="/isaiah/5-30.htm">Isaiah 5:30</a>; <a href="/isaiah/17-12.htm">Isaiah 17:12</a>. On horses they ride; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/4-13.htm">Jeremiah 4:13</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/8-16.htm">Jeremiah 8:16</a>; <a href="/habakkuk/1-8.htm">Habakkuk 1:8</a>. &#1506;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498; in the singular, answering to "cruel it is," points back to &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497; or &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; . is not for &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1488;&#1495;&#1491; (Ros.), but for &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1502;&#1500;&#1495;&#1502;&#1492;, cf. <a href="/1_samuel/17-33.htm">1 Samuel 17:33</a>; <a href="/isaiah/42-13.htm">Isaiah 42:13</a>; and the genitive is omitted only because of the &#1500;&#1502;&#1500;&#1495;&#1502;&#1492; coming immediately after (Graf). "Against thee" is dependent on &#1506;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498;: equipped as a warrior is equipped for the war, against the daughter of Zion. In <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-24.htm">Jeremiah 6:24-26</a> are set forth the terrors and the suspense which the appearance of the foe will spread abroad. In <a href="/jeremiah/6-24.htm">Jeremiah 6:24</a> the prophet, as a member of the people, gives utterance to its feelings. As to the sense, the clauses are to be connected thus: As soon as we hear the rumour of the people, i.e., of its approach, our hands become feeble through dread, all power to resist vanishes: cf. <a href="/isaiah/13-7.htm">Isaiah 13:7</a>; and for the metaphor of travail, <a href="/isaiah/13-8.htm">Isaiah 13:8</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/4-9.htm">Micah 4:9</a>, etc. In v. 28 the inhabitants of Jerusalem, personified as the daughter of Zion, are warned not to go forth of the city into the field or about the country, lest they fall into the enemies' hands and be put to death. &#1502;&#1490;&#1493;&#1512; &#1502;&#1505;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489;, often used by Jeremiah, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-3.htm">Jeremiah 20:3</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/20-10.htm">Jeremiah 20:10</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/46-5.htm">Jeremiah 46:5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-29.htm">Jeremiah 49:29</a>, and, as <a href="/jeremiah/20-10.htm">Jeremiah 20:10</a> shows, taken from <a href="/psalms/31-14.htm">Psalm 31:14</a>. Fear or terrors around, i.e., on all sides danger and destruction threaten. </body></html>
