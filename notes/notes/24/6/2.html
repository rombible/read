Houbigant and several others read it and the next verse thus: “I have likened the daughter of Sion to a pleasant pasture, whither the shepherds, with their flocks, come to feed: they have pitched their tents near it, and they feed round it, every one in his place.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>According to this reading, in which Sion is likened to a rich pasture, the shepherds and their flocks that come together to take possession of it, and eat it up, mean the Chaldean generals and their armies, who should possess themselves of Judea and Jerusalem, with as much ease as shepherds lead their flocks into a fresh and open pasture, and should enrich themselves with the spoil thereof. This is certainly a very easy and probable sense of the passage. Blaney, however, prefers rendering the word <span class="greekheb">נוה</span><span class="ital">habitation; </span>and, taking the verb <span class="greekheb">דמיתי</span>to signify here, not, <span class="ital">I have likened, </span>but, <span class="ital">I have destroyed, </span>(a sense which it sometimes bears,) he reads the passage, “The habitation, even the delightful one, have I doomed to destruction, the daughter of Sion. The shepherds, with their flocks, shall come to her. And they shall pitch their tents against her round about.” “Jerusalem,” he observes, “is in like manner called simply <span class="greekheb">נוה</span>, <span class="ital">the habitation, </span><a href="/isaiah/27-10.htm" title="Yet the defended city shall be desolate, and the habitation forsaken, and left like a wilderness: there shall the calf feed, and there shall he lie down, and consume the branches thereof.">Isaiah 27:10</a>. And it seems entitled to the name by way of eminence, as the chief residence both of Israel and the God of Israel.

The more we indulge in the pleasures of this life, the more we unfit ourselves for the troubles of this life. The Chaldean army shall break in upon the land of Judah, and in a little time devour all. The day is coming, when those careless and secure in sinful ways will be visited. It is folly to trifle when we have eternal salvation to work out, and the enemies of that salvation to fight against. But they were thus eager, not that they might fulfil God's counsels, but that they might fill their own treasures; yet God thereby served his own purposes. The corrupt heart of man, in its natural state, casts out evil thoughts, just as a fountain casts out her waters. It is always flowing, yet always full. The God of mercy is loth to depart even from a provoking people, and is earnest with them, that by repentance and reformation, they may prevent things from coming to extremity.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The whole verse is difficult, but should probably be translated; "to a pasturage, yea a luxuriant pasturage, have I likened (or, have reduced to silence, i. e., destroyed) the daughter of Zion." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. likened&#8212;rather, "I lay waste."

Kimchi and Ben Melech supply the word "woman" as we do; but others supply "land" or "pasture"; and think that the Jewish nation is compared to pleasant and delightful lands and pastures, which are inviting to shepherds to come and pitch their tents about them; as follows. The words are by some rendered, "O beautiful and delicate one, I have cut off, or destroyed the daughter of Zion" (o); in which sense the word is used in <a href="/isaiah/6-5.htm">Isaiah 6:5</a> and to this purpose is the Targum, <p>"O beautiful and delicate one, how hast thou corrupted thy ways? therefore the congregation of Zion is confounded;'' <p>but the former senses seem to be best; in which the word used is understood as having the signification of likening or comparing; for which see Sol 1:9. <p>(o) So Jarchi and Joseph Kimchi.

This passage is one of the most difficult in the book, and if there is corruption of the text anywhere, it is here. The most generally adopted rendering is, "The comely and delicate one will I destroy, even the daughter of Zion," giving the verb the same sense as in <a href="/hosea/4-5.htm">Hosea 4:5</a> (literally it is, <span class="accented">I have brought to silence</span>, or perfect of prophetic certitude). The context, however, seems to favor the rendering "pasturage" (including the idea of a nomad settlement), instead of "comely;" but how to make this fit in with the remainder of the existing text is far from clear. The true and original reading probably only survives in fragments. Ver. 3 - <span class="cmt_word">The shepherds with their flocks</span>, etc.; rather, <span class="accented">To her came shepherds with their flocks</span>; <span class="accented">they have pitched their tents round about her</span>; <span class="accented">they have pastured each at his side</span>.

"These," i.e., the blessings mentioned in <a href="/jeremiah/5-24.htm">Jeremiah 5:24</a>. The second clause repeats the same thing. The good, i.e., which God in His goodness bestowed on them.<p>This is established in <a href="/jeremiah/5-26.htm">Jeremiah 5:26</a>. by bringing home to the people their besetting sins.

The men they catch are the poor, the needy, and the just; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/5-28.htm">Jeremiah 5:28</a> and <a href="/isaiah/29-21.htm">Isaiah 29:21</a>. The figure of bird-catching leads to a cognate one, by which are set forth the gains of the wicked or the produce of their labours. As a cage is filled with captured birds, so the houses of the wicked are filled with deceit, i.e., possessions obtained by deceit, through which they attain to credit, power, and wealth. Graf has overthrown Hitz.'s note, that we must understand by &#1502;&#1512;&#1502;&#1492;, not riches obtained by deceit, but he means and instruments of deceit; and this on account of the following: therefore they enrich themselves. But, as Graf shows, it is not the possession of these appliances, but of the goods acquired by deceit, that has made these people great and rich, "as the birds that fill the cage are not a means for capture, but property got by cunning." &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;, cage, is not strictly a bird-cage, but a bird-trap woven of willows (<a href="/amos/8-1.htm">Amos 8:1</a>), with a lid to shut down, by means of which birds were caught.</body></html>
