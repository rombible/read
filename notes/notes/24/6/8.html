The more we indulge in the pleasures of this life, the more we unfit ourselves for the troubles of this life. The Chaldean army shall break in upon the land of Judah, and in a little time devour all. The day is coming, when those careless and secure in sinful ways will be visited. It is folly to trifle when we have eternal salvation to work out, and the enemies of that salvation to fight against. But they were thus eager, not that they might fulfil God's counsels, but that they might fill their own treasures; yet God thereby served his own purposes. The corrupt heart of man, in its natural state, casts out evil thoughts, just as a fountain casts out her waters. It is always flowing, yet always full. The God of mercy is loth to depart even from a provoking people, and is earnest with them, that by repentance and reformation, they may prevent things from coming to extremity.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Be thou instructed - Be thou chastised: learn the lesson which chastisement is intended to teach thee.<p>Lest my soul - Lest I Myself - not "depart from thee," God does not willingly leave His people, but - "be torn from thee." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8.

Be warned, Jerusalem, lest my soul tear herself from thee, lest I make thee a waste, a land uninhabited."<p>In graphic delineation of the enemy's approach against Jerusalem, the prophet calls on the people to flee. As regarded its situation, Jerusalem belonged to the tribe of Benjamin; the boundary between the tribal domain of Judah and Benjamin passed through the valley of Ben-hinnom on the south side of Jerusalem, and then ran northwards to the west of the city (<a href="/joshua/15-8.htm">Joshua 15:8</a>; <a href="/joshua/18-16.htm">Joshua 18:16</a>.). The city was inhabited by Judeans and Benjamites, <a href="/1_chronicles/9-2.htm">1 Chronicles 9:2</a>. The summons is addressed to the Benjamites as the prophet's fellow-countrymen. Tekoa lay about two hours' journey southwards from Bethlehem, according to Jerome, on a hill twelve Roman miles south of Jerusalem; see on <a href="/joshua/15-59.htm">Joshua 15:59</a>. This town is mentioned because its name admits of a play on the word &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;. The alarm is given in the country south of Jerusalem, because the enemy is coming from the north, so that the flight will be directed southwards. Beth-haccerem, acc. to Jerome, was a hamlet (vicus) between Jerusalem and Tekoa, qui lingua Syra et Hebraic Bethacharma nominatur, et ipse in monte positus, apparently on what is now called the Frank's Hill, Jebel Fureidis; see on <a href="/nehemiah/3-14.htm">Nehemiah 3:14</a>. &#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1514;, the lifting up, that which raises itself up, or is raised; here a lofty beacon or signal, the nature of which is not further made known. The meaning, fire-signal, or ascending column of smoke, cannot be made good from <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/20-38.htm">Judges 20:38</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/20-40.htm">Judges 20:40</a>, since there &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1503; is appended; nor from the statements of classical authors (in Ros.), that in time of war bodies of troops stationed in different places made their positions known to one another by masses of rising flame during the night, and by columns of smoke in the day time. As to the last clause, cf. <a href="/jeremiah/1-14.htm">Jeremiah 1:14</a>. "Great destruction," as in <a href="/jeremiah/4-6.htm">Jeremiah 4:6</a>. - In <a href="/jeremiah/6-2.htm">Jeremiah 6:2</a> the impending judgment is further described. It falls on the daughter of Zion, the capital and its inhabitants, personified as a beautiful and delicately reared woman. &#1504;&#1493;&#1492;, defectively written for &#1504;&#1488;&#1493;&#1492;, contracted from &#1504;&#1488;&#1493;&#1492;, lovely, beautiful. The words are not vocatives, O fair and delicate, but accusatives made to precede their governing verb absolutely, and are explained by "the daughter of Zion," dependent on "I destroy:" the fair and the delicate, namely, the daughter of Zion, I destroy. &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492; as in <a href="/hosea/4-5.htm">Hosea 4:5</a>. The other meaning of this verb, to be like, to resemble, is wholly unsuitable here; and, besides, in this signification it is construed with &#1488;&#1500; or &#1500;. Ew.'s translation, I mean the daughter of Zion, is not justifiable by the usage of the word, the Piel only, and not the Kal, being capable of this interpretation.</body></html>
