They were set upon the world, and wholly carried away by the love of it. If we judge of this sin by God's word, we find multitudes in every station and rank given up to it. Those are to be reckoned our worst and most dangerous enemies, who flatter us in a sinful way. Oh that men would be wise for their souls! Ask for the old paths; the way of godliness and righteousness has always been the way God has owned and blessed. Ask for the old paths set forth by the written word of God. When you have found the good way, go on in it, you will find abundant recompence at your journey's end. But if men will not obey the voice of God and flee to his appointed Refuge, it will plainly appear at the day of judgment, that they are ruined because they reject God's word.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Turned - Violently transferred.

To sanctify a war, i.e., prepare themselves for the war by religious consecration, inasmuch as the war was undertaken under commission from God, and because the departure of the army, like the combat itself, was consecrated by sacrifice and other religious ceremonies; see on <a href="/joel/3-9.htm">Joel 3:9</a>. &#1506;&#1500;&#1492;, to go up against a place as an enemy, not, go up upon, in which case the object, them (the city or walls), could not be omitted. It is plainly the storming or capture of the town that is meant by the going up; hence we may understand what follows: and we will destroy her palaces. We have a rousing call to go up at noon or in clear daylight, joined with "woe to us," a cry of disappointment that they will not be able to gain their ends so soon, not indeed till night; in these we see the great eagerness with which they carry on the assault. &#1497;&#1493;&#1501; &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492;, the day turns itself, declines towards its end; cf. <a href="/psalms/90-9.htm">Psalm 90:9</a>. The enemies act under a commission from God, who has imposed on them the labour of the siege, in order to punish Jerusalem for her sins. Jahveh is here most fittingly called the God of hosts; for as God of the world, obeyed by the armies of heaven, He commands the kings of the earth to chastise His people. Hew wood, i.e., fell trees for making the siege works, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/20-20.htm">Deuteronomy 20:20</a>, both for raising the attacking ramparts,<p>(Note: Agger ex terra lignisque attollitur contra murum, de quo tela jactantur. Veget. de re milit. iv. 15.)<p>and for the entire apparatus necessary for storming the town. &#1506;&#1510;&#1492; is not a collective form from &#1506;&#1509;, like &#1491;&#1468;&#1490;&#1492; from &#1491;&#1468;&#1490;; but the &#1492; is a suffix in spite of the omission of the Mappik, which is given by but a few of the codd., eastern and western, for we know that Mappik is sometimes omitted, e.g., <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/15-28.htm">Numbers 15:28</a>, <a href="/numbers/15-31.htm">Numbers 15:31</a>; cf. Ew. 247, d. We are encouraged to take it so by <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/20-19.htm">Deuteronomy 20:19</a>, where &#1506;&#1510;&#1492; are the trees in the vicinity of the town, of which only the fruit trees were to be spared in case of siege, while those which did not bear eatable fruit were to be made use of for the purposes of the siege. And thus we must here, too, read &#1506;&#1510;&#1492;, and refer the suffix to the next noun (Jerusalem). On "pile up a rampart," cf. <a href="/2_samuel/20-5.htm">2 Samuel 20:5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-2.htm">Ezekiel 4:2</a>, etc. &#1492;&#1508;&#1511;&#1491; is used as passive of Kal, and impersonally. The connection with &#1492;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512; is to be taken like &#1495;&#1504;&#1492; in <a href="/isaiah/29-1.htm">Isaiah 29:1</a> : the city where it is punished, or perhaps like <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/59-6.htm">Psalm 59:6</a>, the relative being supplied: that is punished. &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468; is not to be joined, contrary to the accents, with &#1492;&#1508;&#1511;&#1491; (Ven., J. D. Mich.), a connection which, even if it were legitimate, would give but a feeble thought. It belongs to what follows, "she is wholly oppression in her midst," i.e., on all sides in her there is oppression. This is expanded in <a href="/jeremiah/6-7.htm">Jeremiah 6:7</a>. lxx and Jerome have taken &#1492;&#1511;&#1497;&#1512; from &#1511;&#1512;&#1512;, and translate: like as a cistern keeps its water cool (&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;, frigidam facit), so she keeps her wickedness cool. Hitz. has pronounced in favour of this interpretation, but changes "keep cool" into "keep fresh," and understands the metaphor thus: they take good care that their wickedness does not stagnate or become impaired by disuse. But it would be a strange metaphor to put "keep wickedness cool," for "maintain it in strength and vigour." We therefore, along with Luth. and most commentators, prefer the rabbinical interpretation: as a well makes its water to gush out, etc.; for there is no sufficient force in the objection that &#1502;&#1511;&#1493;&#1512; from &#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, dig, is not a spring but a well, that &#1492;&#1511;&#1497;&#1512; has still less the force of making to gush forth, and that &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512; wholly excludes the idea of causing to spring out. The first assertion is refuted by <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-13.htm">Jeremiah 2:13</a>, &#1502;&#1511;&#1493;&#1512;, fountain of living water; whence it is clear that the word does mean a well fed by a spring. It is true, indeed, that the word &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;, a later way of writing &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512; (cf. <a href="/1_chronicles/11-17.htm">1 Chronicles 11:17</a>. 22 with <a href="/2_samuel/23-15.htm">2 Samuel 23:15</a>. 20), means usually, a pit, a cistern dug out; but this form is not substantially different from &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;, well, puteus, which is used for &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512; in <a href="/psalms/55-24.htm">Psalm 55:24</a> and <a href="/psalms/69-16.htm">Psalm 69:16</a>. Accordingly, this latter form can undoubtedly stand with the force of &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;, as has been admitted by the Masoretes when they substituted for it &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;; cf. the Arab. bi'run. The noun &#1502;&#1511;&#1493;&#1512; puts beyond doubt the legitimacy of giving to &#1492;&#1511;&#1497;&#1512;, from &#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, to dig a well, the signification of making water to gush forth.<p>The form &#1492;&#1511;&#1512;&#1492; is indeed referable to &#1511;&#1512;&#1512;, but only shows, as is otherwise well known, that no very strict line of demarcation can be drawn between the forms of verbs '&#1506;&#1506; and '&#1492;&#1511;&#1497;&#1512; ;&#1506;&#1493;, again, is formed regularly from &#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;. Violence and spoiling; cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-8.htm">Jeremiah 20:8</a>, and <a href="/amos/3-10.htm">Amos 3:10</a>; <a href="/habakkuk/1-3.htm">Habakkuk 1:3</a>. "Before my face," before mine eyes, corresponds to "is heard," as wounds and smitings are the consequences of violence. On that head, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/55-10.htm">Psalm 55:10-12</a>.</body></html>
