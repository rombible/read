They were set upon the world, and wholly carried away by the love of it. If we judge of this sin by God's word, we find multitudes in every station and rank given up to it. Those are to be reckoned our worst and most dangerous enemies, who flatter us in a sinful way. Oh that men would be wise for their souls! Ask for the old paths; the way of godliness and righteousness has always been the way God has owned and blessed. Ask for the old paths set forth by the written word of God. When you have found the good way, go on in it, you will find abundant recompence at your journey's end. But if men will not obey the voice of God and flee to his appointed Refuge, it will plainly appear at the day of judgment, that they are ruined because they reject God's word.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Watchmen - The prophets <a href="/isaiah/52-8.htm">Isaiah 52:8</a>.<p>The second of the trumpet - This was the signal for flight <a href="/jeremiah/6-1.htm">Jeremiah 6:1</a>; <a href="/amos/3-6.htm">Amos 3:6</a>.

Standing on their high watch-tower (<a href="/habakkuk/2-1.htm">Habakkuk 2:1</a>), the prophets scrutinize the horizon for the first appearance of danger, and give warning of it by (metaphorically) blowing a trumpet (so <a href="/amos/3-6.htm">Amos 3:6</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Well might Jeremiah warn the people once more (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/6-8.htm">Jeremiah 6:8</a>), in order to turn sore judgment away from it; but it cannot and will not hear, for it is utterly hardened. Yet can he not be silent; for he is so filled with the fury of God, that he must pour it forth on the depraved race. This is our view of the progress of the thought in these verses; whereas Hitz. and Graf make what is said in <a href="/jeremiah/6-11.htm">Jeremiah 6:11</a> refer to the utterance of the dreadful revelation received in <a href="/jeremiah/6-9.htm">Jeremiah 6:9</a>. But this is not in keeping with "testify that they may hear," or with the unmistakeable contrast between the pouring out of the divine fury, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-11.htm">Jeremiah 6:11</a>, and the testifying that they may hear, <a href="/jeremiah/6-10.htm">Jeremiah 6:10</a>. Just because their ear is uncircumcised to that they cannot hear, is it in vain to speak to them for the purpose of warning them; and the prophet has no alternative left but to pour out on the deaf and seared people that fury of the Lord with which he is inwardly filled. The question: to whom should I speak? etc. (&#1506;&#1500; for &#1488;&#1500;, as <a href="/psalms/111-2.htm">Psalm 111:2</a> and often), is not to be taken as a question to God, but only as a rhetorical turn of the thought, that all further speaking or warning is in vain. "Testify," lay down testimony by exhibiting the sin and the punishment it brings with it. "That they may hear," ut audiant, the Chald. has well paraphrased: ut accipiant doctrinam. Uncircumcised is their ear, as it were covered with a foreskin, so that the voice of God's word cannot find its way in; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/5-24.htm">Jeremiah 5:24</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/4-4.htm">Jeremiah 4:4</a>. The second clause, introduced by &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;, adduces the reason of their not being able to hear. The word of God is become a reproach to them; they are determined not to hearken to it, because it lashes their sins. <a href="/jeremiah/6-11.htm">Jeremiah 6:11</a> comes in adversatively: But the fury of the Lord drives him to speak. &#1495;&#1502;&#1514; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; is not a holy ardour for Jahveh (Graf and many ancient comm.), but the wrath of God against the people, which the prophet cannot contain, i.e., keep to himself, but must pour out. Because they will not take correction, he must inflict the judgment upon them, not merely utter it. The imper. &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1498; is to be taken like &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-9.htm">Jeremiah 6:9</a>, not as an expression of the irresistible necessity which, in spite of all his efforts against it, compels the prophet to pour forth, in a certain sense, the wrath of the Lord on all classes of the people by the very publishing of God's word (Graf); but it is the command of God, to be executed by him, as is shown by "for I stretch out mine hand," <a href="/jeremiah/6-12.htm">Jeremiah 6:12</a>. The prophet is to pour out the wrath of God by the proclamation of God's word, which finds its fulfilment in judgments of wrath; see on <a href="/jeremiah/1-10.htm">Jeremiah 1:10</a>. Upon all classes of the people: the children that play in the street (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/9-20.htm">Jeremiah 9:20</a>), the young men gathered together in a cheerful company, the men and women, old men and them that are full of days, i.e., those who have reached the furthest limit of old age. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; tells why the prophet is so to speak: for upon the whole population will God's wrath be poured out. &#1497;&#1500;&#1468;&#1499;&#1491;, not, be taken captive, but, be taken, overtaken by the wrath, as in <a href="/jeremiah/8-9.htm">Jeremiah 8:9</a>; cf. <a href="/1_samuel/14-41.htm">1 Samuel 14:41</a>.</body></html>
