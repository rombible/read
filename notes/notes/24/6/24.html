Sacrifice and incense were to direct them to a Mediator; but when offered to purchase a license to go on in sin, they provoke God. The sins of God's professing people make them an easy prey to their enemies. They dare not show themselves. Saints may rejoice in hope of God's mercies, though they see them only in the promise: sinners must mourn for fear of God's judgments, though they see them only in the threatenings. They are the worst of revolters, and are all corrupters. Sinners soon become tempters. They are compared to ore supposed to have good metal in it, but which proves all dross. Nothing will prevail to part between them and their sins. Reprobate silver shall they be called, useless and worthless. When warnings, corrections, rebukes, and all means of grace, leave men unrenewed, they will be left, as rejected of God, to everlasting misery. Let us pray, then, that we may be refined by the Lord, as silver is refined.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The effect upon the Jewish people of the news of Nebuchadnezzars approach.<p>Wax feeble - Are relaxed.

The sense of "Know, thou congregation," etc., is far from clear, and has been very variously given. Ros., Dahl., Maur., Umbr., and others, understand &#1506;&#1491;&#1492; of the congregation or assembly of the foreign nations; but the word cannot have this meaning without some further qualifying word. Besides, a second mention of the nations is not suitable to the context. the congregation must be that of Israel. The only question can be, whether we are by this to think of the whole people (of Judah), (Chald, Syr., Ew., and others), or whether it is the company of the ungodly that is addressed, as in the phrase  &#1506;&#1491;&#1514; &#1511;&#1512;&#1495;(Hitz.). But there is little probability in the view, that the crew of the ungodly is addressed along with the nations and the earth. Not less open to debate is the construction of &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1470;&#1489;&#1468;&#1501;. In any case little weight can be attached to Hitz.'s assumption, that &#1488;&#1514; is used only to mark out the &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; as relative pronoun: observe it, O company that is amidst them. The passages, <a href="/jeremiah/38-16.htm">Jeremiah 38:16</a> (Chet.), and <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:3</a>, where &#1488;&#1514; seems to have this force, are different in kind; for a definite noun precedes, and to it the relation  &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;is subjoined. And then what, on this construction, is the reference of &#1489;&#1468;&#1501;, amidst them? Hitz. has said nothing on this point. But it could only be referred to "peoples:" the company which is amidst the peoples; and this gives no reasonable sense. These three words can only be object to "know:" know what is amongst (in) them; or: what is or happens to them (against them). It has been taken in the first sense by Chald. (their sins), Umbr., Maur.: what happens in or amongst them; in the second by Ros., Dahl.: what I shall do against them. Ewald, again, without more ado, changes &#1489;&#1468;&#1501; into &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;: know, thou congregation, what is coming. By this certainly a suitable sense is secured; but there are no sufficient reasons for a change of the text, it is the mere expedient of embarrassment. All the ancient translators have read the present text; even the translation of the lxx: &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b1; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;, has been arrived at by a confounding of letters (&#1491;&#1506;&#1497; &#1506;&#1491;&#1492; with &#1512;&#1506;&#1497; &#1506;&#1491;&#1512;). We understand "congregation" of Israel, i.e., not of the whole people of Judah, but of those to whom the title "congregation" was applicable, i.e., of the godly, small as their number might be. Accordingly, we are not to refer  &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1489;&#1468;&#1501;to "peoples:" what is occurring amidst the peoples, viz., that they are coming to besiege Jerusalem, etc. (<a href="/jeremiah/6-3.htm">Jeremiah 6:3</a>.). Nor is it to be referred to those in Judah who, according to <a href="/jeremiah/6-16.htm">Jeremiah 6:16</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-17.htm">Jeremiah 6:17</a>, do not walk in the right way, and will not give ear to the sound of the trumpet. The latter reference, acc. to which the disputed phrase would be translated: what will happen to them (against them), seems more feasible, and corresponds better to the parallelism of <a href="/jeremiah/6-18.htm">Jeremiah 6:18</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-19.htm">Jeremiah 6:19</a>, since this corresponds better to the parallelism of <a href="/jeremiah/6-18.htm">Jeremiah 6:18</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-19.htm">Jeremiah 6:19</a>, since this same phrase is then explained in <a href="/jeremiah/6-19.htm">Jeremiah 6:19</a> by: I bring evil upon this people.<p>(Note: So that we cannot hold, with Graf, that the reading of the text is "manifestly corrupted;" still less do we hold as substantiated or probable his conjectural reading: &#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1492;&#1506;, and know what I have testified against them.)</body></html>
