Sacrifice and incense were to direct them to a Mediator; but when offered to purchase a license to go on in sin, they provoke God. The sins of God's professing people make them an easy prey to their enemies. They dare not show themselves. Saints may rejoice in hope of God's mercies, though they see them only in the promise: sinners must mourn for fear of God's judgments, though they see them only in the threatenings. They are the worst of revolters, and are all corrupters. Sinners soon become tempters. They are compared to ore supposed to have good metal in it, but which proves all dross. Nothing will prevail to part between them and their sins. Reprobate silver shall they be called, useless and worthless. When warnings, corrections, rebukes, and all means of grace, leave men unrenewed, they will be left, as rejected of God, to everlasting misery.

Napier, <span class="ital">The Ancient Workers in Metal</span>, 1856, pp. 20, 23). In the case here imagined by the prophet, so inextricably is the alloy mixed with the silver, that, though the bellows blow, and the lead is oxidised by the heat, no purification is effected; only impure silver remains.” Dr. p. 39.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The bellows are burned</span>. The objection to this rendering is that the burning of the bellows would involve the interruption of the process of assaying. We might, indeed, translate "are scorched" (on the authority of <a href="/ezekiel/15-4.htm">Ezekiel 15:4</a>), and attach the word rendered "of the fire" to the first clause; the half-verse would then run: "The bellows are scorched through the fire; the lead is consumed," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the bellows are even scorched through the heat of the furnace, and the lead has become entirely oxydized. But this requires us to alter the verb from the masculine to the feminine form of third sing. perf. (reading <span class="accented">tammah</span>). It is better, therefore, to give the verb (which will be Kal, if the <span class="accented">nun</span> be radical) the sense of "snorting," which it has in Aramaic and in Arabic, and which the corresponding noun has in Hebrew (<a href="/jeremiah/8-16.htm">Jeremiah 8:16</a>; <a href="/job/39-20.htm">Job 39:20</a>; <a href="/job/41-12.htm">Job 41:12</a>). The masculine form of the verb rendered "is consumed" is still a difficulty; but we have a better right to suppose that the first letter of <span class="accented">tittom</span> was dropped, owing to its identity with the second letter, than to append (as the first view would require us) an entirely different letter at the end. This being done, the whole passage becomes clear: "The bellows puff, (that) the lead may be consumed of the fire." In any case, the general meaning is obvious. The assayer has spared no trouble, all the rules of his art have been obeyed, but no silver appears as the result of the process. Lead is mentioned, because, before quicksilver was known, it was employed as a flux in the operation of smelting, <span class="cmt_word">Plucked away</span>; rather, <span class="accented">separated</span>, like the dross from the silver. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>A distant, cruel people will execute the judgment, since Judah, under the trial, has proved to be worthless metal. - <a href="/jeremiah/6-22.htm">Jeremiah 6:22</a>.

At the end of this discourse yet again the invasion of the enemy from the far north is announced, cf. <a href="/jeremiah/4-13.htm">Jeremiah 4:13</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-15.htm">Jeremiah 5:15</a>, and its terribleness is portrayed with new colours. The farther the land is from which the enemy comes, the more strange and terrible he appears to the imagination. The farthest (hindmost) sides of the earth (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/25-32.htm">Jeremiah 25:32</a>) is only a heightening of the idea: land of the north, or of the far distance (<a href="/jeremiah/5-15.htm">Jeremiah 5:15</a>); in other words, the far uttermost north (cf. <a href="/isaiah/14-13.htm">Isaiah 14:13</a>). In this notice of their home, Hitz. finds a proof that the enemies were the Scythians, not the Chaldeans; since, acc. to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-6.htm">Ezekiel 38:6</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-15.htm">Ezekiel 38:15</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-2.htm">Ezekiel 39:2</a>, Gog, i.e., The Scythians, come "from the sides of the north." But "sides of the earth" is not a geographical term for any particular northern country, but only for very remote lands; and that the Chaldeans were reckoned as falling within this term, is shown by the passage <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-8.htm">Jeremiah 31:8</a>, according to which Israel is to be gathered again from the land of the north and from the sides of the earth. Here any connection with Scythia in "sides of the earth" is not to be thought of, since prophecy knows nothing of a captivity of Israel in Scythia, but regards Assur and Babylon alone as the lands of the exile of Israelites and Jews. As weapons of the enemy then are mentioned bows (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/4-29.htm">Jeremiah 4:29</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/5-16.htm">Jeremiah 5:16</a>), and the javelin or lance (&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1503;, not shield; see on <a href="/1_samuel/17-6.htm">1 Samuel 17:6</a>). It is cruel, knows no pity, and is so numerous and powerful, that its voice, i.e., the tumult of its approach, is like the roaring of the sea; cf. <a href="/isaiah/5-30.htm">Isaiah 5:30</a>; <a href="/isaiah/17-12.htm">Isaiah 17:12</a>. On horses they ride; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/4-13.htm">Jeremiah 4:13</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/8-16.htm">Jeremiah 8:16</a>; <a href="/habakkuk/1-8.htm">Habakkuk 1:8</a>. &#1506;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498; in the singular, answering to "cruel it is," points back to &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497; or &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; . is not for &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1488;&#1495;&#1491; (Ros.), but for &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1502;&#1500;&#1495;&#1502;&#1492;, cf. <a href="/1_samuel/17-33.htm">1 Samuel 17:33</a>; <a href="/isaiah/42-13.htm">Isaiah 42:13</a>; and the genitive is omitted only because of the &#1500;&#1502;&#1500;&#1495;&#1502;&#1492; coming immediately after (Graf).

In <a href="/jeremiah/6-24.htm">Jeremiah 6:24</a> the prophet, as a member of the people, gives utterance to its feelings. As to the sense, the clauses are to be connected thus: As soon as we hear the rumour of the people, i.e., of its approach, our hands become feeble through dread, all power to resist vanishes: cf. <a href="/isaiah/13-7.htm">Isaiah 13:7</a>; and for the metaphor of travail, <a href="/isaiah/13-8.htm">Isaiah 13:8</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/4-9.htm">Micah 4:9</a>, etc. In v. 28 the inhabitants of Jerusalem, personified as the daughter of Zion, are warned not to go forth of the city into the field or about the country, lest they fall into the enemies' hands and be put to death. &#1502;&#1490;&#1493;&#1512; &#1502;&#1505;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489;, often used by Jeremiah, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-3.htm">Jeremiah 20:3</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/20-10.htm">Jeremiah 20:10</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/46-5.htm">Jeremiah 46:5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-29.htm">Jeremiah 49:29</a>, and, as <a href="/jeremiah/20-10.htm">Jeremiah 20:10</a> shows, taken from <a href="/psalms/31-14.htm">Psalm 31:14</a>.
