The day is coming, when those careless and secure in sinful ways will be visited. It is folly to trifle when we have eternal salvation to work out, and the enemies of that salvation to fight against. But they were thus eager, not that they might fulfil God's counsels, but that they might fill their own treasures; yet God thereby served his own purposes. The corrupt heart of man, in its natural state, casts out evil thoughts, just as a fountain casts out her waters. It is always flowing, yet always full.

The tribe of Benjamin was with the tribe of Judah, and continued with that in the pure worship of God when the ten tribes revolted; and in the land of Israel, when they were carried captive; and besides, Jerusalem, at least part of it, was in the tribe of Benjamin, and particularly Anathoth, which was Jeremiah's native place, was in that tribe; and this altogether is a reason why the children of Benjamin are so distinctly addressed: <p>gather yourselves to flee out of the midst of Jerusalem; where some of this tribe lived, or had betaken themselves for safety: or the Jews in general may be meant; for, as Ephraim is often put for the ten tribes, so Benjamin may be put for the two tribes, as Judah frequently is: or the words may be rendered, "be ye strong" (i) "out of the midst of Jerusalem"; as by the Septuagint, and others; and the sense may be, gather together in bodies out of Jerusalem, and form yourselves into companies, and into an army, and be prepared to meet the enemy, and fight him, who is near at hand; quit yourselves like men, and be strong; show courage and valour; perhaps this is spoken ironically, as Kimchi thinks it is; though he interprets the word, "flee ye"; that is, if ye can find a place to flee to; and the Targum is, <p>"remove out of the midst of Jerusalem;'' <p>but it seems rather to be a direction to go forth and meet the enemy, by what follows: <p>and blow the trumpet in Tekoa; as an alarm of war, to give the people notice of an invasion; that the enemy was at hand, and therefore should provide themselves with armour, and gather together to meet and oppose him. Tekoa was a city in Judah, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-5.htm">2 Chronicles 11:5</a>, famous, for a wise woman in it, in the times of David, <a href="/2_samuel/14-2.htm">2 Samuel 14:2</a>. Jerom says it was twelve miles from Jerusalem, and might be seen with the eye; so that probably it was built on a very high hill, and for that reason chosen to blow the trumpet on, that it might be heard far and near; and which may be confirmed from its being said (k) to be the chief place in the land of Israel for the best oil, since olives grow on hills and mountains. There is in the clause a beautiful play on words (l), which those, who understand the Hebrew language, will easily observe: <p>and set up a fire in Bethhaccerem. This place, as Jerom says, lay between Jerusalem and Tekoa; one of this name is mentioned in <a href="/nehemiah/3-14.htm">Nehemiah 3:14</a>. The Targum renders it, <p>"the house of the valley of the vineyards;'' <p>and in the Misnah (m) mention is made of the valley of Bethhaccerem, the dust of which was red, and, when water was poured upon it, became hard; and this valley perhaps took its name from the town, which might be built upon a hill, and was famous for vines, from whence it was so called; and here might be a very high tower; for, as Kimchi and Ben Melech observe, it signifies a high tower, for the keepers of the vines to sit and watch the vines all about; and this was a very proper place to set up the sign of fire in, to give notice to the country all around; for it was usual with all nations, Persians, Grecians, and Romans, to signify in the night, by signs of fire, by burning torches, and the like, either the approach of an enemy, or help from friends; the former was done by shaking and moving their torches, the latter by holding them still (n); see <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/20-38.htm">Judges 20:38</a>, <p>for evil appeareth out of the north; Nebuchadnezzar and his army out of Babylon, which lay north of Jerusalem: and great destruction; see <a href="/jeremiah/1-14.htm">Jeremiah 1:14</a>. <p>(i)  Sept.

In this clause also a play on words seems intended between the imperative and its object.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Beth-haccherem</span>] (House of the vineyard) mentioned elsewhere only in <a href="/nehemiah/3-14.htm" title="But the dung gate repaired Malchiah the son of Rechab, the ruler of part of Bethhaccerem; he built it, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof.">Nehemiah 3:14</a>, and to be identified in position with a conical-shaped hill called the Frank mountain, between Bethlehem and Tekoa, so named as having been used for military purposes in the Crusades; a very suitable spot for a beacon station.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-8.</span> - Arrival of a hostile army from the north, and summons to flee from the doomed city. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">O ye children of Benjamin</span>. The political rank of Jerusalem, as the capital of the kingdom of Judah, makes it difficult to realize that Jerusalem was not locally a city of Judah at all. It belonged, strictly speaking, to the tribe of Benjamin, a tribe whose insignificance, in comparison with Judah, seems to have led to the adoption of a form of expression not literally accurate (see Psalm 128:68). The true state of the case is evident from an examination of the two parallel passages, <a href="/joshua/15-7.htm">Joshua 15:7, 8</a>, and Joshua 18:16, 17. As Mr. Fergusson points out, "The boundary between Judah and Benjamin... ran at the foot of the hill on which the city stands, so that the city itself was actually in Benjamin, while, by crossing the narrow ravine of Hinnom, you set foot on the territory of Judah" (Smith's 'Dictionary of the Bible,' 1:983). It is merely a specimen of the unnatural method of early harmonists when Jewish writers tell us that the altars and the sanctuary were in Benjamin, and the courts of the temple in Judah. The words of "<span class="accented">the</span> blessing of Moses" are clear (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-12.htm">Deuteronomy 33:12</a>): "The beloved of the Lord! he shall dwell in safety by him, sheltering him continually, and between his shoulders he dwelleth;" <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. Benjamin is specially protected, the sanctuary being on Benjamite soil. And yet these highly favored "children of Benjamin" are divinely warned to flee from their sacred homes (see <a href="/jeremiah/7-4.htm">Jeremiah 7:4-7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Gather yourselves to flee</span>; more strictly, <span class="accented">save your goods by flight</span>. In <a href="/jeremiah/4-6.htm">Jeremiah 4:6</a> the same advice was given to the inhabitants of the country districts. There, Jerusalem was represented as the only safe refuge; here, the capital being no longer tenable, the wild pasture-land to the south (the foe being expected from the north) becomes the goal of the fugitives of <span class="accented">Jerusalem</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>In Tokoa</span>. Tokoa was a town in the wild hill-county to the south of Judah, the birthplace of the prophet Amos. It is partly mentioned because its name seems to connect it with the verb rendered <span class="cmt_word">blow the trumpet</span>. Such paronomasiae are favorite oratorical instruments of the prophets, and especially in connections like the present (comp. <a href="/isaiah/10-30.htm">Isaiah 10:30</a>; <a href="/micah/1-10.htm">Micah 1:10-15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">A sign of fire in Beth-hakkerem</span>; rather, <span class="accented">a signal on Beth-hakkerem</span>. The rendering of Authorized Version was suggested by <a href="/judges/20-38.htm">Judges 20:38, 40</a>; but there is nothing in the present context (as there is in that passage) to favor the view that a fiery beacon is intended. Beth-hakkerem lay, according to St. Jerome, on an eminence between Jerusalem and Tekoa; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. probably the hill known as the Frank Mountain, the Arabic name of which (<span class="accented">Djebel el-Furaidis</span>, Little Paradise Mountain) is a not unsuitable equivalent for the Hebrew (Vineyard-house). The "district of Beth-hakkerem" is mentioned in <a href="/nehemiah/3-14.htm">Nehemiah 3:14</a>. The choice of the locality for the signal was a perfect one. "There is no other tell," remarks Dr. Thomson, "of equal height and size in Palestine." <span class="cmt_word">Appeareth</span>; <span class="accented">rather</span>, <span class="accented">bendeth forward</span>, as if it were ready to fall. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The people has by its sins brought about the withdrawal of these blessings (the withholding of rain, etc.). &#1492;&#1496;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, turned away, as in <a href="/amos/5-12.htm">Amos 5:12</a>; <a href="/malachi/3-5.htm">Malachi 3:5</a>. "These," i.e., the blessings mentioned in <a href="/jeremiah/5-24.htm">Jeremiah 5:24</a>. The second clause repeats the same thing. The good, i.e., which God in His goodness bestowed on them.<p>This is established in <a href="/jeremiah/5-26.htm">Jeremiah 5:26</a>. by bringing home to the people their besetting sins. In (amidst) the people are found notorious sinners. &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; in indefinite generality: they spy about, lie in wait; cf. <a href="/hosea/13-7.htm">Hosea 13:7</a>. The singular is chosen because the act described is not undertaken in company, but by individuals. &#1513;&#1473;&#1498; from &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1498;, bend down, stoop, as bird-catchers hide behind the extended nets till the birds have gone in, so as then to draw them tight. "They set;" not the fowlers, but the wicked ones. &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1497;&#1514;, destroyer (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/12-23.htm">Exodus 12:23</a>, and often), or destruction (<a href="/ezekiel/21-36.htm">Ezekiel 21:36</a>); here, by virtue of the context, a trap which brings destruction. The men they catch are the poor, the needy, and the just; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/5-28.htm">Jeremiah 5:28</a> and <a href="/isaiah/29-21.htm">Isaiah 29:21</a>. The figure of bird-catching leads to a cognate one, by which are set forth the gains of the wicked or the produce of their labours. As a cage is filled with captured birds, so the houses of the wicked are filled with deceit, i.e., possessions obtained by deceit, through which they attain to credit, power, and wealth. Graf has overthrown Hitz.'s note, that we must understand by &#1502;&#1512;&#1502;&#1492;, not riches obtained by deceit, but he means and instruments of deceit; and this on account of the following: therefore they enrich themselves. But, as Graf shows, it is not the possession of these appliances, but of the goods acquired by deceit, that has made these people great and rich, "as the birds that fill the cage are not a means for capture, but property got by cunning." &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;, cage, is not strictly a bird-cage, but a bird-trap woven of willows (<a href="/amos/8-1.htm">Amos 8:1</a>), with a lid to shut down, by means of which birds were caught.</body></html>
