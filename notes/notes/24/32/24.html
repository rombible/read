What the prophet had then predicted had now come to pass, and Jerusalem was now exposed to the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, which were its inevitable accompaniments. And it was at such a time as this, when the darkness was thickest, that a ray of hope for the future was given by the command to buy the field at Anathoth. And yet the command was so strange, and the hope so apparently against all probabilities, that the prophet ends his prayer by leaving the whole matter in the hands of Jehovah.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/32.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>32:16-25 Jeremiah adores the Lord and his infinite perfections. When at any time we are perplexed about the methods of Providence, it is good for us to look to first principles. Let us consider that God is the fountain of all being, power, and life; that with him no difficulty is such as cannot be overcome; that he is a God of boundless mercy; that he is a God of strict justice; and that he directs every thing for the best. Jeremiah owns that God was righteous in causing evil to come upon them. Whatever trouble we are in, personal or public, we may comfort ourselves that the Lord sees it, and knows how to remedy it. We must not dispute God's will, but we may seek to know what it means.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/32.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The mounts - See <a href="/jeremiah/6-6.htm">Jeremiah 6:6</a> note. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/32.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24. mounts&#8212;mounds of earth raised as breastworks by the besieging army, behind which they employed their engines, and which they gradually pushed forward to the walls of the city.<p>behold, thou seest it&#8212;connected with Jer 32:25.

The prayer runs thus, <a href="/jeremiah/32-17.htm">Jeremiah 32:17</a> : "Ah, Lord Jahveh! behold, Thou hast made the heaven and the earth by Thy great power and Thine outstretched arm; to Thee nothing is impossible. <a href="/jeremiah/32-18.htm">Jeremiah 32:18</a>. Thou showest mercy unto thousands, and repayest the iniquity of fathers into the bosom of their children after them, Thou great and mighty God, whose name is Jahveh of hosts. <a href="/jeremiah/32-19.htm">Jeremiah 32:19</a>. Great in counsel and mighty in deed, whose eyes are open to all the ways of the children of men, to give unto every one according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his works: <a href="/jeremiah/32-20.htm">Jeremiah 32:20</a>. Thou who didst signs and wonders in the land of Egypt until this day, both in Israel and among [other] men, and madest for Thyself a name, as it is this day; <a href="/jeremiah/32-21.htm">Jeremiah 32:21</a>. And didst lead Thy people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs and wonders, and with strong hand and outstretched arm, and with great terror, <a href="/jeremiah/32-22.htm">Jeremiah 32:22</a>. And didst give them this land, which Thou hast sworn to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey; <a href="/jeremiah/32-23.htm">Jeremiah 32:23</a>. And they came and took possession of it, but they hearkened not to Thy voice and walked not in Thy law: all that Thou commandedst them to do they did not, therefore didst Thou cause all this evil to come against them. <a href="/jeremiah/32-24.htm">Jeremiah 32:24</a>. Behold, the besiegers' mounds are come to the city, to take it, and the city will be given into the hands of the Chaldeans, who fight against it, because of the sword, hunger, and pestilence; and what Thou didst speak is come to pass, and, behold, Thou seest it. <a href="/jeremiah/32-25.htm">Jeremiah 32:25</a>. Yet Thou hast said to me, O Lord Jahveh, 'Buy thee the field for money, and take witnesses,' while the city is being delivered into the hands of the Chaldeans."<p>This prayer contains a laudation of the omnipotence of the Lord and the justice of His dealing among all men (<a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-17.htm">Jeremiah 32:17-19</a>), and especially in the guidance of the people Israel (<a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-20.htm">Jeremiah 32:20-23</a>), with the view of connecting with it the question, how the divine command to buy the field is to be reconciled with the decreed deliverance of the city into the power of the Chaldeans (<a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-24.htm">Jeremiah 32:24</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/32-25.htm">Jeremiah 32:25</a>). <a href="/jeremiah/32-17.htm">Jeremiah 32:17</a>. God proclaims His omnipotence in the creation of the heaven and the earth, cf. <a href="/jeremiah/27-5.htm">Jeremiah 27:5</a>. From this it is plain that nothing is too wonderful for God, i.e., is impossible for Him, <a href="/genesis/18-14.htm">Genesis 18:14</a>. As Creator and Ruler of the world, God exercises grace and justice. The words of <a href="/jeremiah/32-18.htm">Jeremiah 32:18</a> are a reminiscence and free imitation of the passages <a href="/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>. and <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-7.htm">Jeremiah 34:7</a>, where the Lord so depicts His dealings in the guidance of men. To "recompense iniquity into the bosom" (see <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/65-6.htm">Isaiah 65:6</a>, cf. <a href="/psalms/79-12.htm">Psalm 79:12</a>), i.e., to pour into the bosom of the garment the reward for iniquity, so that it may be carried away and borne; cf. <a href="/ruth/3-15.htm">Ruth 3:15</a>; <a href="/proverbs/17-23.htm">Proverbs 17:23</a>. "The great and mighty God," as in <a href="/deuteronomy/10-17.htm">Deuteronomy 10:17</a>. On "Jahveh of hosts is His name," cf. <a href="/jeremiah/10-16.htm">Jeremiah 10:16</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/31-35.htm">Jeremiah 31:35</a>. &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1493; is to be explained thus: "O Thou great God, whose name is Jahveh of hosts." </body></html>
