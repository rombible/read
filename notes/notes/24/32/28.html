It is sin, and nothing else, that ruins them. The restoration of Judah and Jerusalem is promised. This people were now at length brought to despair. But God gives hope of mercy which he had in store for them hereafter. Doubtless the promises are sure to all believers. God will own them for his, and he will prove himself theirs. He will give them a heart to fear him. All true Christians shall have a disposition to mutual love. Though they may have different views about lesser things, they shall all be one in the great things of God; in their views of the evil of sin, and the low estate of fallen man, the way of salvation through the Saviour, the nature of true holiness, the vanity of the world, and the importance of eternal things. Whom God loves, he loves to the end. We have no reason to distrust God's faithfulness and constancy, but only our own hearts. He will settle them again in Canaan. These promises shall surely be performed. Jeremiah's purchase was the pledge of many a purchase that should be made after the captivity; and those inheritances are but faint resemblances of the possessions in the heavenly Canaan, which are kept for all who have God's fear in their hearts, and do not depart from him. Let us then bear up under our trials, assured we shall obtain all the good he has promised us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/32.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I will give - Or, I am giving.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/32.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>27. Jehovah retorts Jeremiah's own words: I am indeed, as thou sayest (Jer 32:17), the God and Creator of "all flesh," and "nothing is too hard for Me"; thine own words ought to have taught thee that, though Judea and Jerusalem are given up to the Chaldeans now for the sins of the Jews, yet it will not be hard to Me, when I please, to restore the state so that houses and lands therein shall be possessed in safety (Jer 32:36-44).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/32.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/32.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Therefore thus saith the Lord, behold, I will give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans,.... As he had foretold by the prophet, and was just now going to be fulfilled. Here the Lord repeats and confirms the first of the two things which seemed contradictory; the destruction of the city by the Chaldeans, who were now besieging it, and into whose hands it would certainly come: <p>and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; who was now before it with his army: <p>and he shall take it; and become master of it: or, "I will give it to him, that he may take it" (f); which he could not do, notwithstanding his powerful army, had not the Lord delivered it into his hands. <p>(f) "ut capiat eam", Junius &amp; Tremellius, Schmidt. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/32.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and he shall take it:</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/32.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">28</span>. <span class="ital">thus saith the Lord</span>] A formula only suitable to introduce an utterance by the prophet himself is here assigned to the Divine speaker.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will give;</span> rather, <span class="accented">I am on the point of giving</span> (present participle). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/32.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Lord has further shown this omnipotence and righteousness in His guidance of Israel, in His leading them out of Egypt with wonders and signs; cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/6-22.htm">Deuteronomy 6:22</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/34-11.htm">Deuteronomy 34:11</a>. "Until this day" cannot mean that the wonders continue in Egypt until this day - still less, that their glorious remembrance continues till this day (Calvin, Rosenmller, etc.). Just as little can we connect the words with what follows, "until this day, in Egypt and among men," as Jerome supposed; although the idea et in Israel et in cunctis mortalibus quotidie tua signa complentur is in itself quite right. Logically considered, "until this day" belongs to the verb. '&#1493;&#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1514;&#1468; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;, and the construction is pregnant, as in <a href="/jeremiah/11-7.htm">Jeremiah 11:7</a> : "Thou hast done wonders in Egypt, and hast still been doing them until this day in Israel and among other men." "Men," in contrast to "Israel," are mankind outside of Israel - other men, the heathen; on the expression, cf. <a href="/judges/18-7.htm">Judges 18:7</a>; <a href="/isaiah/43-4.htm">Isaiah 43:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/73-5.htm">Psalm 73:5</a>. "As at this day:" cf. <a href="/jeremiah/11-5.htm">Jeremiah 11:5</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/25-18.htm">Jeremiah 25:18</a>. Through signs and wonders the Lord wrought, leading Israel out of Egypt, and into the land of Canaan, which had been promised to their fathers. <a href="/jeremiah/32-21.htm">Jeremiah 32:21</a> is almost exactly the same as <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-8.htm">Deuteronomy 26:8</a>, cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/4-34.htm">Deuteronomy 4:34</a>. &#1502;&#1493;&#1512;&#1488; refers to the terror spread among the neighbouring nations, <a href="/exodus/15-14.htm">Exodus 15:14</a>., by the wonders, especially the slaying of the first-born among the Egyptians, <a href="/exodus/12-30.htm">Exodus 12:30</a>., and the miracle at the Red Sea. On "a land flowing with milk and honey," cf. <a href="/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>. </body></html>
