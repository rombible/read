When at any time we are perplexed about the methods of Providence, it is good for us to look to first principles. Let us consider that God is the fountain of all being, power, and life; that with him no difficulty is such as cannot be overcome; that he is a God of boundless mercy; that he is a God of strict justice; and that he directs every thing for the best. Jeremiah owns that God was righteous in causing evil to come upon them. Whatever trouble we are in, personal or public, we may comfort ourselves that the Lord sees it, and knows how to remedy it.

"I wrote it (the necessary terms) in the letter (the usual letter of purchase), and sealed it, and took witnesses, and weighed out the money on the balance" (it was then and still is the custom in the East to weigh money). &#1495;&#1514;&#1501; means here, not to append a seal instead of subscribing the name, or for attestation (cf. <a href="/1_kings/21-8.htm">1 Kings 21:8</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/10-1.htm">Nehemiah 10:1</a>; 2), but to seal up, make sure by sealing (<a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/29-11.htm">Isaiah 29:11</a>, etc.). For, from <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-11.htm">Jeremiah 32:11</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-12.htm">Jeremiah 32:12</a>, we perceive that two copies of the bill of purchase were prepared, one sealed up, and the other open; so that, in case the open one were lost, or were accidentally or designedly injured or defaced, a perfect original might still exist in the sealed-up copy. Then "Jeremiah took the bill of purchase, the sealed one," - the specification and the conditions - "and the open one." The words &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1510;&#1493;&#1492; &#1493;&#1492;&#1495;&#1511;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; are in apposition with '&#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1505;&#1508;&#1512; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;. The Vulgate renders stipulationes et rata; Jerome, stipulatione rata, which he explains by stipulationibus et sponsionibus corroborata. &#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1492;, usually "a command, order," is probably employed here in the general sense of "specification," namely, the object and the price of purchase; &#1495;&#1511;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, "statutes," the conditions and stipulations of sale. The apposition has the meaning, "containing the agreement and the conditions." Both copies of this bill, the prophet-before the eyes of Hanamel, his cousin (&#1491;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;, either in the general sense of a near relation, since the relationship has been stated exactly enough already, or &#1489;&#1468;&#1503;&#1470; has been inadvertently omitted), and before the eyes of, i.e., in the presence of "the witnesses, who wrote in the letter of purchase," i.e., had subscribed it as witnesses in attestation of the matter, and in the eyes of all the Jews who were sitting in the court of the prison, and in whose presence the transaction had been concluded - delivered up to his attendant Baruch, son of Nerijah, the son of Mahsejah, with the words, <a href="/jeremiah/32-14.htm">Jeremiah 32:14</a> : "Thus saith Jahveh of hosts, the God of Israel: Take these letters, this sealed-up letter of purchase and this open letter, and put them into an earthen vessel, that they may remain a long time there. <a href="/jeremiah/32-15.htm">Jeremiah 32:15</a>. For thus saith Jahveh of hosts, the God of Israel: Houses, and fields, and vineyards shall still be bought in this land." - The second utterance of the Lord (<a href="/jeremiah/32-15.htm">Jeremiah 32:15</a>) declares the reason why the letters were to be preserved in an earthen vessel, in order to protect them from damp, decay, and destruction, namely, because one could make use of them afterwards, when sale of property would still be taking place. There is also implied the intimation, that the present desolation of the land and the transportation of its inhabitants will only last during their time; and then the population of Judah will return, and enter again on the possession of their land. The purchase of the field on the part of Jeremiah had this meaning; and for the sake of this meaning it was announced to him by God, and completed before witnesses, in the presence of the Jews who happened to be in the court of the prison. </body></html>
