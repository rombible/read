It is sin, and nothing else, that ruins them. The restoration of Judah and Jerusalem is promised. This people were now at length brought to despair. But God gives hope of mercy which he had in store for them hereafter. Doubtless the promises are sure to all believers. God will own them for his, and he will prove himself theirs. He will give them a heart to fear him. All true Christians shall have a disposition to mutual love. Though they may have different views about lesser things, they shall all be one in the great things of God; in their views of the evil of sin, and the low estate of fallen man, the way of salvation through the Saviour, the nature of true holiness, the vanity of the world, and the importance of eternal things. Whom God loves, he loves to the end. We have no reason to distrust God's faithfulness and constancy, but only our own hearts. He will settle them again in Canaan. These promises shall surely be performed. Jeremiah's purchase was the pledge of many a purchase that should be made after the captivity; and those inheritances are but faint resemblances of the possessions in the heavenly Canaan, which are kept for all who have God's fear in their hearts, and do not depart from him. Let us then bear up under our trials, assured we shall obtain all the good he has promised us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/32.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>From their youth - God's mighty deeds for Israel began in Egypt <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-20.htm">Jeremiah 32:20</a>, and so did Israel's sin.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/32.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>30. have &#8230; done&#8212;literally, "have been doing"; implying continuous action.<p>only &#8230; evil &#8230; only provoked me&#8212;They have been doing nothing else but evil; their sole aim seems to have been to provoke Me.<p>their youth&#8212;the time when they were in the wilderness, having just before come into national existence.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/32.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> If they had offended me only by some particular single acts, or by some few omissions, or but for a small time, I might have been judged too severe upon them; but from the time they first began to be a nation they have made it their business, course, and trade, passing from one idolatry to another, &c. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/32.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For the children of Israel and the children of Judah,....

The fall of Jerusalem is the climax of the series of punishments which the two separated and yet (in God's sight) united portions of the people of Israel have had to undergo. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/32.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>These wonders of grace which the Lord wrought for His people, Israel requited with base unthankfulness. When they had got into possession of the land, they did not listen to the voice of their God, and did the reverse of what He had commanded. (The Kethib &#1489;&#1514;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;&#1498; might be read as a plural. But since &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492; in the plural is always written elsewhere &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;&#1514; (cf. <a href="/genesis/26-5.htm">Genesis 26:5</a>; <a href="/exodus/16-28.htm">Exodus 16:28</a>; <a href="/exodus/18-20.htm">Exodus 18:20</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/26-46.htm">Leviticus 26:46</a>, etc.), and the omission of the &#1497; in plural suffixes is unusual (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/38-22.htm">Jeremiah 38:22</a>), the word rather seems to have been incorrectly written for &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;&#1512;&#1514;&#1498; (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/26-4.htm">Jeremiah 26:4</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-10.htm">Jeremiah 44:10</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/44-23.htm">Jeremiah 44:23</a>), i.e., the w seems to have been misplaced. Therefore the Lord brought on them this great calamity, the Chaldean invasion (&#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488; for &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;&#1492;); cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-22.htm">Jeremiah 13:22</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/31-29.htm">Deuteronomy 31:29</a>. With this thought, the prophet makes transition to the questions addressed to the Lord, into which the prayer glides. In <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-24.htm">Jeremiah 32:24</a>, the great calamity is more fully described. The ramparts of the besieging enemy have come to the city (&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1488; with acc.), to take it, and the city is given (&#1504;&#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492;, prophetic perfect) into the hands of the Chaldeans. "Because of the sword;" i.e., the sword, famine, and pestilence (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/14-16.htm">Jeremiah 14:16</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-16.htm">Jeremiah 25:16</a>, etc.) bring them into the power of the enemy. "What Thou spakest," i.e., didst threaten through the prophets, "is come to pass; and, behold, Thou seest it (viz., what has happened), and yet (&#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; adversative) Thou sayest to me, 'Buy the field,' " etc. The last clause, '&#1493;&#1492;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512; &#1504;, is a "circumstantial" one, and is not a part of God's address, but is added by Jeremiah in order to give greater prominence to the contrast between the actual state of matters and the divine command regarding the purchase. The prayer concludes with this, which is for men an inexplicable riddle, not (as Ngelsbach thinks) for the purpose of leaving to the reader the solution of the problem, after all aids have been offered him - for Jeremiah would not need to direct his question to God for that purpose - but in order to ask from God an explanation regarding the future. This explanation immediately follows in the word of the Lord, which, from <a href="/jeremiah/32-26.htm">Jeremiah 32:26</a> onwards, is addressed to the prophet. </body></html>
