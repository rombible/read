Other reasons make it probable that the Septuagint has preserved for us an earlier text, in which all direct mention of the king of Babylon is omitted and the 70 years are given as the duration of Judah's captivity, and not of the Babylonian empire. The fuller text of the Masorites is to be explained by the dislocation which Jehoiakim's scroll evidently suffered. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/25.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. all &#8230; written in this book, which Jeremiah &#8230; prophesied against all &#8230; nations&#8212;It follows from this, that the prophecies against foreign nations (forty-sixth through fifty-first chapters) must have been already written. Hence the Septuagint inserts here those prophecies. But if they had followed immediately (Jer 25:13), there would have been no propriety in the observation in the verse. The very wording of the reference shows that they existed in some other part of the book, and not in the immediate context. It was in this very year, the fourth of Jehoiakim (Jer 36:1, 2), that Jeremiah was directed to write in a regular book for the first time all that he had prophesied against Judah and foreign "nations" from the beginning of his ministry. Probably, at a subsequent time, when he completed the whole work, including the forty-sixth through fifty-first chapters, Jeremiah himself inserted the clause, "all that is written in this book, which Jeremiah hath prophesied against all the nations." The prophecies in question may have been repeated, as others in Jeremiah, more than once; so in the original smaller collection they may have stood in an earlier position; and, in the fuller subsequent collection, in their later and present position.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/25.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">That land; </span> the land of the Babylonians and Chaldeans. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/25.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And I will bring upon that land all my words which I have pronounced against it,....

(See Introd. iv. §§ 10 ff.) The Greek Version as it stands now ends the sentence with “in this book,” and reads as a new sentence, and title of the section on the nations, “What Jeremiah prophesied against the nations,” although it is probable that originally these words were, as in E.VV., merely descriptive of “even all … book.” Upon this follows, with the heading “The things of (concerning) Elam,” what with us appears as ch. <a href="/context/jeremiah/49-35.htm" title="Thus said the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will break the bow of Elam, the chief of their might....">Jeremiah 49:35-39</a>, and then, although in a different order of grouping, the other prophecies against foreign nations including Babylon, which in the Hebrew text (and E.VV.) come at the end of the whole Book (chs. 46–51). Which arrangement (if either, which Co. doubts) is the original one? Against the LXX’s order it is urged that by the Greek arrangement the passing of sentence upon the nations (<span class="ital"><a href="/context/jeremiah/25-15.htm" title="For thus said the LORD God of Israel to me; Take the wine cup of this fury at my hand, and cause all the nations, to whom I send you, to drink it....">Jeremiah 25:15-38</a></span> [<a href="/context/jeremiah/32-1.htm" title="The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar....">Jeremiah 32:1-24</a>]) is made to follow, whereas it should naturally precede, the announcement of punishments as set forth in detail in the prophecies themselves. In favour of the order of the LXX as the original one are the following considerations: (<span class="ital">a</span>) It is unlikely that the words rendered “which Jeremiah hath prophesied, etc.” (<span class="ital"><a href="/jeremiah/25-13.htm" title="And I will bring on that land all my words which I have pronounced against it, even all that is written in this book, which Jeremiah has prophesied against all the nations.">Jeremiah 25:13</a></span>) should be from the prophet himself, while the clause would form a natural heading to the collection of prophecies against foreign nations, occurring thus <span class="ital">in the course</span> of the Book (as in Ezekiel chs. 25–32). When Hebrew editors of the text removed them to the end, the clause in question was left behind (cp. the converse proceeding pointed out in note on <a href="/jeremiah/51-64.htm" title="And you shall say, Thus shall Babylon sink, and shall not rise from the evil that I will bring on her: and they shall be weary. Thus far are the words of Jeremiah.">Jeremiah 51:64</a>) and considered to be the conclusion of the preceding sentence; (<span class="ital">b</span>) we should a <span class="ital">priori</span> expect these prophecies to appear here in company with the kindred matter (<span class="ital"><a href="/context/jeremiah/25-15.htm" title="For thus said the LORD God of Israel to me; Take the wine cup of this fury at my hand, and cause all the nations, to whom I send you, to drink it....">Jeremiah 25:15-38</a></span>). There is however a third hypothesis, which deserves serious consideration, viz. that in both Hebrew and LXX texts these prophecies stood at the end of ch. 25, and were removed to the respective positions which they now occupy in the two texts, because (<span class="ital">a</span>) the general overthrow anticipated at the time of the battle of Carchemish, and set forth in the vision of the wine-cup, did not in fact occur, and (<span class="ital">b</span>) the modifications of an apocalyptic character, apparently introduced into the latter part of this ch. in order to apply its threatening to a last judgement of the world, rendered it no longer a suitable introduction to them. This view is strongly supported by Peake who argues that the closing words of <span class="ital"><a href="/jeremiah/25-13.htm" title="And I will bring on that land all my words which I have pronounced against it, even all that is written in this book, which Jeremiah has prophesied against all the nations.">Jeremiah 25:13</a></span> should be taken as indicating a stage at which the Hebrew, and not only the LXX, placed these prophecies at this point.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I will bring</span>, etc. Clearly this verse cannot have formed part of the original prophecy, but must have been added whenever the collection of prophecies against foreign nations finally assumed its present form (see introduction on Jeremiah 50, 51.). It should be mentioned that the Septuagint separates the last clause of the verse, "that which Jeremiah prophesied," etc., and makes it the heading of the group of prophecies against the nations, which in the Hebrew Bible stand at the end of Jeremiah's prophecies, but which, beginning with "Elam," the Alexandrian Version inserts at this point. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/25.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The seventy years' Chaldean bondage of Judah and the peoples. - <a href="/jeremiah/25-3.htm">Jeremiah 25:3</a>.

And this land shall become a desert, a desolation, and these peoples shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years."<p>The very beginning of this discourse points to the great crisis in the fortunes of Judah. Jeremiah recalls into the memory of the people not merely the whole time of his own labours hitherto, but also the labours of many other prophets, who, like himself, have unremittingly preached repentance to the people, called on them to forsake idolatry and their evil ways, and to return to the God of their fathers - but in vain (<a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-3.htm">Jeremiah 25:3-7</a>). The 23 years, from the 13th of Josiah till the 4th of Jehoiakim, are thus made up: 19 years of Josiah and 4 years of Jehoiakim, including the 3 months' reign of Jehoahaz.
