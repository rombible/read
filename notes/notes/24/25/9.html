The received text, however, reads, "and unto Nebuchadnezzar," etc. Neither reading is satisfactory. The latter one is intolerably harsh; the former makes Nebuchadnezzar a mere adjunct of the tribes of the north. In the other passages, moreover, where this king is solemnly entitled "my servant," the clause is the most prominent one in the sentence (see <a href="/jeremiah/27-6.htm">Jeremiah 27:6</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/43-10.htm">Jeremiah 43:10</a>). The words in question have a sort of family resemblance to the glosses which meet us occasionally both in the form of the Hebrew text represented by the Massoretic recension, and those by the principal ancient versions. The words are omitted by the Septuagint. <span class="cmt_word">My servant</span>. Generally to be a "servant" of Jehovah or of any supposed deity is to be a worshipper. Thus Daniel is called by Darius, "servant of the living God" (<a href="/daniel/6-20.htm">Daniel 6:20</a>), and thus Abdallah, "servant of Allah," has become a favorite surname of the followers of Mohammed. In the Book of Jeremiah itself (<a href="/jeremiah/30-10.htm">Jeremiah 30:10</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/46-27.htm">Jeremiah 46:27, 28</a>), and in Ezekiel (<a href="/ezekiel/37-25.htm">Ezekiel 37:25</a>), "my servant" is the form in which Jehovah addresses his chosen people; and in the second part of Isaiah the suffering Messiah is so styled. Here, however, a foreign king is thus entitled. How is this to be explained? Cyrus, no doubt, in <a href="/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>, 45:1, is called "my shepherd" and "my anointed one;" but then Cyrus, in the view of the prophet, was a genuine though unconscious worshipper of the true God (<a href="/isaiah/41-25.htm">Isaiah 41:25</a>), whereas Nebuchadnezzar was known to be a polytheist and an idolater. We must, therefore, take "servant" to be applied to Nebuchadnezzar in a lower sense than to the other bearers of the title. The Hebrew 'ebbed, in fact, may be either "slave" in something approaching to the terrible modern sense, or in the sense in which Eliezer was one (i.e. little less than a son, and a possible heir, <a href="/genesis/24-2.htm">Genesis 24:2</a>; <a href="/galatians/4-1.htm">Galatians 4:1</a>), and which is still in full force in Arabia. <span class="cmt_word">An astonishment</span> (see on Jeremiah 2:11). <span class="cmt_word">An hissing</span> (comp. <a href="/jeremiah/18-16.htm">Jeremiah 18:16</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/19-8.htm">Jeremiah 19:8</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/25.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The seventy years' Chaldean bondage of Judah and the peoples. - <a href="/jeremiah/25-3.htm">Jeremiah 25:3</a>.

And destroy from among them the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the sound of the mill and the light of the lamp. <a href="/jeremiah/25-11.htm">Jeremiah 25:11</a>. And this land shall become a desert, a desolation, and these peoples shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years."<p>The very beginning of this discourse points to the great crisis in the fortunes of Judah. Jeremiah recalls into the memory of the people not merely the whole time of his own labours hitherto, but also the labours of many other prophets, who, like himself, have unremittingly preached repentance to the people, called on them to forsake idolatry and their evil ways, and to return to the God of their fathers - but in vain (<a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-3.htm">Jeremiah 25:3-7</a>). The 23 years, from the 13th of Josiah till the 4th of Jehoiakim, are thus made up: 19 years of Josiah and 4 years of Jehoiakim, including the 3 months' reign of Jehoahaz.
