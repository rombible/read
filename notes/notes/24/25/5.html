God keeps an account how long we possess the means of grace; and the longer we have them, the heavier will our account be if we have not improved them. Rising early, points out the earnest desire that this people should turn and live. Personal and particular reformation must be insisted on as necessary to a national deliverance; and every one must turn from his own evil way. Yet all was to no purpose.

This, the fate awaiting them, is more fully described in <a href="/jeremiah/24-9.htm">Jeremiah 24:9</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/24-10.htm">Jeremiah 24:10</a>. In <a href="/jeremiah/24-8.htm">Jeremiah 24:8</a> the "yea, thus saith," is inserted into the sentence by way of repetition of the "thus saith," <a href="/jeremiah/24-5.htm">Jeremiah 24:5</a>. &#1499;&#1468;&#1503; is resumed and expanded by &#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1514;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="/jeremiah/24-9.htm">Jeremiah 24:9</a>. The "princes" are Zedekiah's courtiers. Those in Egypt are they who during the war had fled thither to hide themselves from judgment.

Hitz., Ew., Umbr., Gr., following the lxx, delete this word, but without due cause. The further description of the ill-usage in "for a reproach," etc., is based on <a href="/deuteronomy/28-37.htm">Deuteronomy 28:37</a>; and is intensified by the addition of "and for an object of cursing," to show that in their case the curse there recorded will be fulfilled. From the last words, according to which disgrace will light on them in all the lands they are driven into, it appears that captivity will fall to the lot of such as are yet to be found in the land. But captivity involves new hostile invasions, and a repeated siege and capture of Jerusalem; during which many will perish by sword, famine, and plague. Thus and by deportation they shall be utterly rooted out of the land of their fathers. Cf. <a href="/jeremiah/29-17.htm">Jeremiah 29:17</a>., where Jeremiah repeats the main idea of this threatening. </body></html>
