Hence, when our Saviour asks James and John, whether they were able to <span class="ital">drink of the cup which </span>he was to <span class="ital">drink of, </span>he means, whether they had resolution and patience to undergo the like sufferings as his Father had allotted for him.

And Jeremiah the prophet, who announced them, is considered as acting the part of a cup-bearer, carrying the cup round to those who were appointed to drink of it; the effects of which were to appear in the intoxication, that is, the terror and astonishment, the confusion and desolation, that should prevail among them.” — Blaney.

Under this figure is represented the desolation then coming upon that part of the world, of which Nebuchadnezzar, who had just began to reign and act, was to be the instrument; but this destroying sword would come from the hand of God. The desolations the sword should make in all these kingdoms, are represented by the consequences of excessive drinking. This may make us loathe the sin of drunkenness, that the consequences of it are used to set forth such a woful condition. Drunkenness deprives men of the use of their reason, makes men as mad. It takes from them the valuable blessing, health; and is a sin which is its own punishment. This may also make us dread the judgments of war. It soon fills a nation with confusion. They will refuse to take the cup at thy hand. They will not believe Jeremiah; but he must tell them it is the word of the Lord of hosts, and it is in vain for them to struggle against Almighty power.

The prophet: <p>take the wine cup of this fury at my hand; in a vision the Lord appeared to Jeremiah with a cup of wine in his hand, which he bid him take of him.

"All the families of the north" points back to all the tribes of the kingdoms of the north, <a href="/jeremiah/1-14.htm">Jeremiah 1:14</a>. &#1493;&#1488;&#1500; &#1504;&#1489;&#1493;&#1498; cannot be joined with "and take," but must depend from &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495; in such a way that that verb is again repeated in thought. Ew. proposes to read &#1493;&#1488;&#1514; according to some codd., especially as Syr., Chald., Vulg. have rendered by an accusative. Against this Graf has justly objected, that then Nebuchadnezzar would be merely mentioned by the way as in addition to the various races, whereas it is he that brings these races and is the instrument of destruction in God's hand. Ew.'s reading is therefore to be unhesitatingly rejected. No valid reason appears for pronouncing the words: and to Nebuchadrezzar...my servant, to be a later interpolation (Hitz., Gr.) because they are not in the lxx. There is prominence given to Nebuchadnezzar by the very change of the construction, another "send" requiring to be repeated before "to Nebuchadrezzar." God calls Nebuchadnezzar His servant, as the executor of His will on Judah, cf. <a href="/jeremiah/27-6.htm">Jeremiah 27:6</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/43-10.htm">Jeremiah 43:10</a>. The "them" in "and bring them" refers to Nebuchadnezzar and the races of the north.
