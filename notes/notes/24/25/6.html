God keeps an account how long we possess the means of grace; and the longer we have them, the heavier will our account be if we have not improved them. Rising early, points out the earnest desire that this people should turn and live. Personal and particular reformation must be insisted on as necessary to a national deliverance; and every one must turn from his own evil way. Yet all was to no purpose.

So long as they served the Lord God, they continued in their own land, in the comfortable enjoyment of all the blessings of it; for their government was a theocracy; God was their King; and as long as they served and worshipped him only, he protected and defended them; but when they forsook him, and went after other gods, and served and worshipped them, then they were threatened to be turned out of their land, and carried captive into other lands; and yet, after all, if they returned from their idolatries, and left off worshipping idols, the Lord was ready to receive them kindly, and continue his favours to them: <p>and provoke me not to anger with the works of your hands; their idols, which their own hands made, and then fell down to worship them; than which nothing can be more provoking to God: <p>and I will do you no hurt; by sword, or famine, or pestilence, or captivity; signifying the hurt he had threatened them with should not be done, provided they forsook their idolatrous worship; God does no hurt to his true worshippers; yea, he makes all things work together for their good. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/25.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And go not after other gods to serve them, and to worship them, and provoke me not to anger with the works of your hands; and I will do you no hurt.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/25.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>. <span class="ital">provoke me not</span>] Read <span class="bld">provoke not Jehovah,</span> a correction easily made in the Hebrew.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/24.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>And as one deals with the bad uneatable figs, i.e., throws them away, so will the Lord deliver up to ignominious ruin Zedekiah with his princes and the remainder of the people, both those still staying in the land and those living in Egypt. This, the fate awaiting them, is more fully described in <a href="/jeremiah/24-9.htm">Jeremiah 24:9</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/24-10.htm">Jeremiah 24:10</a>. In <a href="/jeremiah/24-8.htm">Jeremiah 24:8</a> the "yea, thus saith," is inserted into the sentence by way of repetition of the "thus saith," <a href="/jeremiah/24-5.htm">Jeremiah 24:5</a>. &#1499;&#1468;&#1503; is resumed and expanded by &#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1514;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="/jeremiah/24-9.htm">Jeremiah 24:9</a>. The "princes" are Zedekiah's courtiers. Those in Egypt are they who during the war had fled thither to hide themselves from judgment. From the beginning of <a href="/jeremiah/24-9.htm">Jeremiah 24:9</a> to &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; is verbally the same as <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-4.htm">Jeremiah 15:4</a>, save that &#1500;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492; is added to make more marked the contrast to &#1500;&#1496;&#1493;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468;, <a href="/jeremiah/24-5.htm">Jeremiah 24:5</a> - the evil, namely, that is done to them. Hitz., Ew., Umbr., Gr., following the lxx, delete this word, but without due cause. The further description of the ill-usage in "for a reproach," etc., is based on <a href="/deuteronomy/28-37.htm">Deuteronomy 28:37</a>; and is intensified by the addition of "and for an object of cursing," to show that in their case the curse there recorded will be fulfilled. From the last words, according to which disgrace will light on them in all the lands they are driven into, it appears that captivity will fall to the lot of such as are yet to be found in the land. But captivity involves new hostile invasions, and a repeated siege and capture of Jerusalem; during which many will perish by sword, famine, and plague. Thus and by deportation they shall be utterly rooted out of the land of their fathers. Cf. <a href="/jeremiah/29-17.htm">Jeremiah 29:17</a>., where Jeremiah repeats the main idea of this threatening. </body></html>
