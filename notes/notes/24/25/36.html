This is one of the direful effects of war, that even those that are most harmless and inoffensive, often suffer hard things.

Noise reacheth to the end of the earth, for controversy hath Jahveh with the nations; contend will He with all flesh; the wicked He gives to the sword, is the saying of Jahveh. <a href="/jeremiah/25-32.htm">Jeremiah 25:32</a>. Thus saith Jahveh of hosts: Behold, evil goeth forth from nation to nation, and (a) great storm shall raise itself from the utmost coasts of the earth. <a href="/jeremiah/25-33.htm">Jeremiah 25:33</a>. And the slain of Jahveh shall lie on that day from one end of the earth unto the other, shall not be lamented, neither gathered nor buried; for dung shall they be upon the ground. <a href="/jeremiah/25-34.htm">Jeremiah 25:34</a>.

For your days are filled for the slaughter; and I scatter you so that ye shall fall like a precious vessel. <a href="/jeremiah/25-35.htm">Jeremiah 25:35</a>.

Desolated are the pastures of peace because of the heat of Jahveh's anger. <a href="/jeremiah/25-38.htm">Jeremiah 25:38</a>. He hath forsaken like a young lion his covert; for their land is become a desert, because of the oppressing sword, and because of the heath of His anger."<p>In this passage the emblem of the cup of the Lord's anger (<a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-25.htm">Jeremiah 25:25-29</a>) is explained by a description of the dreadful judgment God is to inflict on all the inhabitants of the earth. This is not the judgment on the world at large as distinguished from that proclaimed in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-15.htm">Jeremiah 25:15-29</a> against the kingdom of God and the kingdoms of the world, as Ng. supposes. It is the nature of this same judgment that is here discussed, not regard being here paid to the successive steps of its fulfilment. <a href="/jeremiah/25-30.htm">Jeremiah 25:30</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/25-31.htm">Jeremiah 25:31</a> are only a further expansion of the second half of <a href="/jeremiah/25-29.htm">Jeremiah 25:29</a>. "All these words" refers to what follows. The clause"Jahveh will roar" to "let His voice resound" is a reminiscence from <a href="/joel/3-16.htm">Joel 3:16</a> and <a href="/amos/1-2.htm">Amos 1:2</a>; but instead of "out of Zion and out of Jerusalem" in those passages, we have here "from on high," i.e., heaven, and out of His holy habitation (in heaven), because the judgment is not to fall on the heathen only, but on the theocracy in a special manner, and on the earthly sanctuary, the temple itself, so that it can come only from heaven or the upper sanctuary. Jahveh will roar like a lion against His pasture (the pasture or meadow where His flock feeds, cf. <a href="/jeremiah/10-25.htm">Jeremiah 10:25</a>); a name for the holy land, including Jerusalem and the temple; not: the world subject to Him (Ew.). '&#1492;&#1497;&#1491;&#1491; , He will answer Hedad like treaders of grapes; i.e., raise a shout as they do. Answer; inasmuch as the shout or wary-cry of Jahveh is the answer to the words and deeds of the wicked. Grammatically &#1492;&#1497;&#1491;&#1491; is accus. and object to the verb: Hedad he gives as answer. The word is from &#1492;&#1491;&#1491;, crash, and signifies the loud cry with which those that tread grapes keep time in the alternate raising and thrusting of the feet. Ew. is accordingly correct, though far from happy, in rendering the word "tramping-song;" see on <a href="/isaiah/16-9.htm">Isaiah 16:9</a>. As to the figure of the treader of grapes, cf. <a href="/isaiah/63-3.htm">Isaiah 63:3</a>.</body></html>
