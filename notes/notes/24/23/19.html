These false teachers would be compelled to suffer the most bitter part of the Lord's indignation. They made themselves believe that there was no harm in sin, and practised accordingly; then they made others believe so. Those who are resolved to go on in evil ways, will justly be given up to believe strong delusions. But which of them had received any revelation of God, or understood any thing of his word? There was a time coming when they would reflect on their folly and unbelief with remorse. The teaching and example of the true prophets led men to repentance, faith, and righteousness. The false prophets led men to rest in forms and notions, and to be quiet in their sins.

Or, "behold, a whirlwind of the Lord, of the fury is gone forth" (b); which latter clause explains the former; and, hews, that by "the whirlwind of the Lord" is meant his "fury" or "wrath"; which, like a whirlwind, would come suddenly, and at an unawares, and be very boisterous and powerful, and carry all before it; and which was gone forth from the Lord in the decree and commission; and would quickly break out and appear in the Chaldean army that would invade Judea and besiege Jerusalem, compared to a full and fanning wind, and its chariots to a whirlwind, <a href="/jeremiah/4-11.htm">Jeremiah 4:11</a>; from whence it would appear, that these men, the false prophets, were not in the counsel of God; had seen no vision from him, nor had marked his word: since they prophesied of peace and prosperity, when a blustering storm was coming: <p>even a grievous whirlwind: it shall fall grievously upon the head of the wicked; or "rest" (c) thereon; even on the head of the wicked prophets, and all such wicked persons as give heed unto them; on them it would fall with its full weight, and give excessive pain, and there continue to their utter ruin. Kimchi says this refers to the days of the Messiah, when all the wicked shall be consumed. It may refer to the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans, at least include it; which was a grievous whirlwind indeed. <p>(b)     "ecce turbo Domini exandescentia", Montanus, Junius &amp; Tremellius; "en procella Jehovae! ira exivit", Schmidt.

The latter did foolishly (&#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1500;&#1492;, prop. of that which is unsalted, insipid, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/6-6.htm">Job 6:6</a>, hence irrational, insulsum), since they prophesied, being inspired by Baal the no-god, and by such prophesying led the people into error; cf. <a href="/1_kings/18-19.htm">1 Kings 18:19</a>. Much more horrible is the conduct of the prophets of Jerusalem, who commit adultery, walk in lying, and strengthen the wicked in their wickedness, not merely by their delusive pretences (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-17.htm">Jeremiah 23:17</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/6-14.htm">Jeremiah 6:14</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/14-13.htm">Jeremiah 14:13</a>), but also by their immoral lives, so that no one turns from his wickedness, cf. <a href="/ezekiel/13-22.htm">Ezekiel 13:22</a>. &#1500;&#1489;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; is here and in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-18.htm">Jeremiah 27:18</a>, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/20-20.htm">Exodus 20:20</a>, construed, contrary to the usage everywhere else, not with the infin., but with the verb. fin. As the prophets, instead of converting the wicked, only confirmed them in their sins, therefore all the inhabitants of Judah or Jerusalem are become as corrupt as Sodom and Gomorrah. "They all" are not the prophets, but the inhabitants of Judah or Jerusalem; and "the inhabitants thereof" are those of the capital, cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/32-32.htm">Deuteronomy 32:32</a>; <a href="/isaiah/1-10.htm">Isaiah 1:10</a>. On the seducers the Lord will therefore inflict punishment, because impiousness has gone forth from them over the whole land.
