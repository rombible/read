These false teachers would be compelled to suffer the most bitter part of the Lord's indignation. They made themselves believe that there was no harm in sin, and practised accordingly; then they made others believe so. Those who are resolved to go on in evil ways, will justly be given up to believe strong delusions. But which of them had received any revelation of God, or understood any thing of his word? There was a time coming when they would reflect on their folly and unbelief with remorse. The teaching and example of the true prophets led men to repentance, faith, and righteousness. The false prophets led men to rest in forms and notions, and to be quiet in their sins.

Primarily the meaning is: the Jews will not "consider" now God's warnings (De 32:29); but when the prophecies shall be fulfilled in their Babylonish exile, they will consider and see, by bitter experience, their sinful folly. The ultimate scope of the prophecy is: the Jews, in their final dispersion, shall at last "consider" their sin and turn to Messiah "perfectly" (Ho 3:5; Zec 12:5, 10-14; Lu 13:35).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/23.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> It is therefore called a <span class="ital">continuing whirlwind</span>, <span class="bld"><a href="/jeremiah/30-23.htm" title="Behold, the whirlwind of the LORD goes forth with fury, a continuing whirlwind: it shall fall with pain on the head of the wicked.">Jeremiah 30:23</a></span>. The prophet speaks of the judgment as of a messenger, which coming from God, should not return till it had done its errand, and executed what it came for, even whatever God had resolved it should effect. Men are ready to flatter themselves that they shall either outride or outlive the storms of Divine vengeance. No, (saith the prophet,) the anger of the Lord shall bring to pass whatsoever the just will of God is. And though you will not now believe it, but flatter yourselves with idle, vain hopes, yet hereafter, when it shall be too late, (which is the usual folly of sinners,) then you shall consider it perfectly. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/23.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>The anger of the Lord shall not return,....

The prophet's interpretation of the image. It is the judicial anger of Jehovah, personified as Divine manifestations so often are (hence "shall not return"). The form of the verse reminds us of <a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>. <span class="cmt_word">In the latter days</span>; rather, <span class="accented">in future days</span>, as Dr. Henderson rightly renders. It seems better to restrict the term "latter days" to the Messianic period ("the coming age," <a href="/matthew/12-32.htm">Matthew 12:32</a>), to which, in fact, it is often applied (e.g. <a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2</a>; <a href="/hosea/3-5.htm">Hosea 3:5</a>). The phrase in itself simply means "in the sequel of the days," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the future; its Messianic reference, when this exists, is inferred solely from the context. In the passage before us, and in <a href="/deuteronomy/4-30.htm">Deuteronomy 4:30, 30</a>:29, there can be no intention of pointing to the Messianic age. Precisely the same phrase occurs in an Assyrian inscription, where its meaning is clear from the context (<span class="accented">aria akhrat yumi irib</span>, "For a sequel of days - i.e., for a future time - I deposited"). In the present case it is no distant period to which the prophet refers, for he continues, <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall consider it</span>, etc., or rather, <span class="accented">ye shall understand it clearly</span>, viz. that the calamities which will have come upon you are the Divine judgment upon your sins. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/23.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>To display the vileness of the prophets, these are parallelized with the prophets of Samaria.

Much more horrible is the conduct of the prophets of Jerusalem, who commit adultery, walk in lying, and strengthen the wicked in their wickedness, not merely by their delusive pretences (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-17.htm">Jeremiah 23:17</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/6-14.htm">Jeremiah 6:14</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/14-13.htm">Jeremiah 14:13</a>), but also by their immoral lives, so that no one turns from his wickedness, cf. <a href="/ezekiel/13-22.htm">Ezekiel 13:22</a>. &#1500;&#1489;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; is here and in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-18.htm">Jeremiah 27:18</a>, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/20-20.htm">Exodus 20:20</a>, construed, contrary to the usage everywhere else, not with the infin., but with the verb. fin. As the prophets, instead of converting the wicked, only confirmed them in their sins, therefore all the inhabitants of Judah or Jerusalem are become as corrupt as Sodom and Gomorrah. "They all" are not the prophets, but the inhabitants of Judah or Jerusalem; and "the inhabitants thereof" are those of the capital, cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/32-32.htm">Deuteronomy 32:32</a>; <a href="/isaiah/1-10.htm">Isaiah 1:10</a>. On the seducers the Lord will therefore inflict punishment, because impiousness has gone forth from them over the whole land.
