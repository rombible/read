"And when this people, or the prophet, or a priest ask thee, saying: What is the burden of Jahveh? then say to them: What the burden is - now I will cast you off, saith Jahveh. <a href="/jeremiah/23-34.htm">Jeremiah 23:34</a>. And the prophet, the priest, and the people that shall say: burden of Jahveh, on that man will I visit it and on his house. <a href="/jeremiah/23-35.htm">Jeremiah 23:35</a>. Thus shall ye say each to the other, and each to his brother: What hath Jahveh answered, and what hath Jahveh spoken? <a href="/jeremiah/23-36.htm">Jeremiah 23:36</a>. But burden of Jahveh shall ye mention no more, for a burden to every one shall his own word be; and ye wrest the words of the living God Jahveh of hosts, our God. <a href="/jeremiah/23-37.htm">Jeremiah 23:37</a>. Thus shalt thou say to the prophet: What hath Jahveh answered thee, and what hath He spoken? <a href="/jeremiah/23-38.htm">Jeremiah 23:38</a>. But if ye say: burden of Jahveh, therefore thus saith Jahveh: Because ye say this word: burden of Jahveh, and yet I have sent unto you, saying, Ye shall not say: burden of Jahveh; <a href="/jeremiah/23-39.htm">Jeremiah 23:39</a>. Therefore, behold, I will utterly forget you, and cast away from my face you and this city that I gave you and your fathers, <a href="/jeremiah/23-40.htm">Jeremiah 23:40</a>. And will lay upon you everlasting reproach, and everlasting, never-to-be-forgotten disgrace."<p>The word &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488;, from &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;, lift up, bear, sig. burden, and, like the phrase: lift up the voice, means a saying of weighty or dread import. The word has the latter sig. in the headings to the prophecies of threatening character; see on <a href="//biblehub.com/nahum/1-1.htm">Nahum 1:1</a>, where this meaning of the word in the headings is asserted, and the widespread opinion that it means effatum is refuted. Jeremiah's adversaries - as appears from these verses - used the word "burden" of his prophetic sayings by way of mockery, meaning burdensome prophecies, in order to throw ridicule on the prophet's speeches, by them regarded as offensive. Thus if the people, or a prophet, or a priest ask: What is the burden of Jahveh, i.e., how runs it, or what does it contain? he is to answer: The Lord saith: I will cast you off, i.e., disburden myself of you, as it were - the idea of "burden" being kept up in the answer to the question. The article on the word prophet is used to show that the word is used generally of the class of prophets at large. The &#1488;&#1514; in the answering clause is nota accus., the following phrase being designedly repeated from the question; and hence the unusual combination &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1502;&#1492;. The sense is: as regards the question what the burden is, I will cast you away. There is no reason to alter the text to fit the lxx translation: &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;, or Vulg.: vos estis onus, as Cappell., J. D. Mich., Hitz., Gr., etc., do. The lxx rendering is based, not on another reading, but on another division of the words, viz., &#1488;&#1514;&#1501; &#1492;&#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;. - In <a href="/jeremiah/23-34.htm">Jeremiah 23:34</a> the meaning of this answer is more fully explained. On every one that uses the word "burden" in this sneering way God will avenge the sneer, and not only on his person, but on his house, his family as well. In <a href="/jeremiah/23-35.htm">Jeremiah 23:35</a> they are told how they are to speak of prophecy. <a href="/jeremiah/23-36.htm">Jeremiah 23:36</a>. They are no longer to make use of the phrase "burden of Jahveh," "for the burden shall his word be to each one," i.e., the word "burden" will be to each who uses it a burden that crushes him down. "And ye wrest," etc., is part of the reason for what is said: and ye have  equals  for ye have wrested the words of the living God. The clause is properly a corollary which tells what happens when they use the forbidden word.</body></html>
