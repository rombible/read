These false teachers would be compelled to suffer the most bitter part of the Lord's indignation. They made themselves believe that there was no harm in sin, and practised accordingly; then they made others believe so. Those who are resolved to go on in evil ways, will justly be given up to believe strong delusions. But which of them had received any revelation of God, or understood any thing of his word? There was a time coming when they would reflect on their folly and unbelief with remorse. The teaching and example of the true prophets led men to repentance, faith, and righteousness.

Therefore Jeremiah passes directly from his discourse against the wicked kings to rebuking the false prophets; and if we may presume from the main substance, the latter discourse belongs to the same time as the former. It begins<p><a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-9.htm">Jeremiah 23:9-11</a><p>With a description of the pernicious practices of these persons. - <a href="/jeremiah/23-9.htm">Jeremiah 23:9</a>. "Concerning the prophets. Broken is mine heart within me; all my bones totter. I am become like a drunken man, and like a man whom wine hath overcome, because of Jahveh and because of His holy words. <a href="/jeremiah/23-10.htm">Jeremiah 23:10</a>. For of adulterers the land is full, for because of the curse the land withereth, the pastures of the wilderness dry up; and their course is become evil, and their strength not right. <a href="/jeremiah/23-11.htm">Jeremiah 23:11</a>. For both prophet and priest are profane; yea, in mine house found I their wickedness, saith Jahveh. <a href="/jeremiah/23-12.htm">Jeremiah 23:12</a>. Therefore their way shall be to them as slippery places in darkness, they shall be thrown down and fall therein; for I bring evil upon them, the year of their visitation, saith Jahveh. <a href="/jeremiah/23-13.htm">Jeremiah 23:13</a>. In the prophets of Samaria saw I folly; they prophesied in the name of Baal, and led my people Israel astray. <a href="/jeremiah/23-14.htm">Jeremiah 23:14</a>. But in the prophets of Jerusalem saw I an horrible thing, committing adultery and walking in falsehood, and they strengthen the hands of the wicked, that none returneth from his wickedness. They are all become to me as Sodom, and the inhabitants thereof as Gomorrah. <a href="/jeremiah/23-15.htm">Jeremiah 23:15</a>. Therefore thus saith Jahveh of hosts concerning the prophets: Behold, I feed them with wormwood, and give them to drink water of bitterness; for from the prophets of Jerusalem is profaneness gone forth over all the land."<p>"Concerning the prophets" is the heading, as in <a href="/jeremiah/46-2.htm">Jeremiah 46:2</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/48-1.htm">Jeremiah 48:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-1.htm">Jeremiah 49:1</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-7.htm">Jeremiah 49:7</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-23.htm">Jeremiah 49:23</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/49-28.htm">Jeremiah 49:28</a>; and corresponds to the woe uttered against the wicked shepherds, <a href="/jeremiah/23-1.htm">Jeremiah 23:1</a>. It refers to the entire portion vv. 9-40, which is thus distinguished from the oracles concerning the kings, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-1.htm">Jeremiah 21:1-14</a> and 22. It might indeed be joined, according to the accents, with what follows: because of the prophets is my heart broken; but as the cause of Jeremiah's deep agitation is given at the end of the second half-verse: because of Jahveh, etc., it is not likely the seer would in one sentence have given two different and quite separate reasons. The brokenness of his heart denotes the profoundest inward emotion yet not despondency by reason of sin and misery, like "a broken heart" in <a href="/psalms/34-19.htm">Psalm 34:19</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/51-19.htm">Psalm 51:19</a>, etc., but because of God's wrath at the impious lives of the pseudo-prophets. This has overcome him, and this he must publish. This wrath had broken his heart and seized on all his bones, so that they nervelessly tremble, and he resembles a drunken man who can no longer stand firm on his feet. He feels himself inwardly quite downcast; he not only feels the horrors of the judgment that is to befall the false prophets and corrupt priests who lead the people astray, but knows well the dreadful sufferings the people too will have to endure. The verb &#1512;&#1495;&#1507; occurs only twice in the Piel besides in the present passage; in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a>, of the Spirit of God that in the beginning of creation brooded over the waters of the earth, and <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-11.htm">Deuteronomy 32:11</a>, of the eagle that flutters over her young - in Arabic rchf, to be soft. The root meaning of the word is doubtless: to be flaccid; here accordingly, to totter, to sway to and fro. "Because of Jahveh" is more fully explained by "because of the words of His holiness," i.e., the words which God as holy has made known to him regarding the unholy ongoings of the pseudo-prophets. - From <a href="/jeremiah/23-10.htm">Jeremiah 23:10</a> onwards come the sayings of God which have so terribly agitated the prophet. The land is full of adulterers. Adultery in the literal sense is mentioned by way of example, as a reckless transgression of God's commands, then much in vogue, whereby the moral foundations of the kingdom were broken up. In <a href="/jeremiah/23-14.htm">Jeremiah 23:14</a> the prophets are said to commit adultery and walk in lying, cf. <a href="/jeremiah/29-23.htm">Jeremiah 29:23</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/5-7.htm">Jeremiah 5:7</a>. By reason of this vice a curse lies on the land, under which it is withering away. The clause "for because of the curse," etc., is not to be taken as parenthesis (Ng.), but as co-ordinate with the previous clause, giving the second, or rather the chief ground, why Jeremiah is so deeply distressed. The reason of this is not so much the prevailing moral corruption, as the curse lying on the land because of the moral corruption of its inhabitants. &#1488;&#1500;&#1492; is not perjury (Chald., Rashi, Kimchi), but the curse wherewith God punishes the transgression of His covenant laws, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-3.htm">Jeremiah 11:3</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-8.htm">Jeremiah 11:8</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15</a>., <a href="/jeremiah/29-19.htm">Jeremiah 29:19</a>. The words are modelled after <a href="/isaiah/24-4.htm">Isaiah 24:4</a>.; and &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; is not the population, but the land itself, which suffers under God's curse, and which is visited with drought; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/12-4.htm">Jeremiah 12:4</a>. The next words point to drought. &#1504;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; &#1502;&#1491;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; as in <a href="/jeremiah/9-9.htm">Jeremiah 9:9</a>. By &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1497; the further description of the people's depravity is attached to the first clause of the verse. Their course is become evil; their running or racing, i.e., the aim and endeavour of the ungodly. The suffix on this word &#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1510;&#1514;&#1501; refers not to "adulterers," but ad sensum to the inhabitants of the land. Their strength is not-right, i.e., they are strong, valiant in wrong; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/9-2.htm">Jeremiah 9:2</a>. For - so goes <a href="/jeremiah/23-11.htm">Jeremiah 23:11</a> - both prophets and priests, who should lead the people in the right way, are profane, and desecrate by their wickedness even the house of God, presumably by idolatry; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/32-34.htm">Jeremiah 32:34</a>. There is no reason for thinking here, as Hitz. does, of adultery practised in the temple.</body></html>
