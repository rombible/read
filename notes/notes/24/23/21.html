These false teachers would be compelled to suffer the most bitter part of the Lord's indignation. They made themselves believe that there was no harm in sin, and practised accordingly; then they made others believe so. Those who are resolved to go on in evil ways, will justly be given up to believe strong delusions. But which of them had received any revelation of God, or understood any thing of his word? There was a time coming when they would reflect on their folly and unbelief with remorse. The teaching and example of the true prophets led men to repentance, faith, and righteousness. The false prophets led men to rest in forms and notions, and to be quiet in their sins.

They might be sent of men, and be encouraged by them; but they were not sent of God: it is not only necessary that men employed in religious affairs should have an external call, in an orderly way, from the church of God; but also an internal call from the Lord himself; he qualifying them with gifts, putting his word into their mouths, and inclining their hearts to publish it; see <a href="/hebrews/5-4.htm">Hebrews 5:4</a>; but these false prophets had no mission nor commission from the Lord, nor were they sent on any errand, or with any message from him; and <p>yet they ran; showed great diligence and zeal, and made haste to tell the people what the Lord had never said to them, but what were the warm imaginations of their own heads and hearts; they ran a race or course of ministry, but it was not good, as in <a href="/jeremiah/23-10.htm">Jeremiah 23:10</a>. The Targum adds, <p>"to do evil:'' <p>I have not spoken to them, yet they prophesied; wherefore what they prophesied was not the word of the Lord, but what they themselves devised; and so was what was false, as the Targum adds: it is a sad character of men when they speak in public neither by the will of God, nor according to the word of God. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/23.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">I have not sent these prophets, yet they ran: I have not spoken to them, yet they prophesied.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/23.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">21–24</span>.

Much more horrible is the conduct of the prophets of Jerusalem, who commit adultery, walk in lying, and strengthen the wicked in their wickedness, not merely by their delusive pretences (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-17.htm">Jeremiah 23:17</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/6-14.htm">Jeremiah 6:14</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/14-13.htm">Jeremiah 14:13</a>), but also by their immoral lives, so that no one turns from his wickedness, cf. <a href="/ezekiel/13-22.htm">Ezekiel 13:22</a>. &#1500;&#1489;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; is here and in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-18.htm">Jeremiah 27:18</a>, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/20-20.htm">Exodus 20:20</a>, construed, contrary to the usage everywhere else, not with the infin., but with the verb. fin. As the prophets, instead of converting the wicked, only confirmed them in their sins, therefore all the inhabitants of Judah or Jerusalem are become as corrupt as Sodom and Gomorrah. "They all" are not the prophets, but the inhabitants of Judah or Jerusalem; and "the inhabitants thereof" are those of the capital, cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/32-32.htm">Deuteronomy 32:32</a>; <a href="/isaiah/1-10.htm">Isaiah 1:10</a>. On the seducers the Lord will therefore inflict punishment, because impiousness has gone forth from them over the whole land.
