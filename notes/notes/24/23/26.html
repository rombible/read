To invent such lies, and deceive the people, and turn them away from God; agreeably to the preceding and following verses: this shows that this was not through ignorance and inadvertence; it was a meditated and studied thing by them; they contrived it in their hearts, and they were resolute and bent upon it, and took much delight and pleasure in it; their hearts were in it, and it was in them to do as they did; and in this way they had been long, but should continue no longer. Or the words may be rendered, "how long?"

(i) nothing that is good; truth is not there; nothing but lies and deceit; the word of God is not there, as it is with the true prophet of the Lord, "he that hath my word", as in <a href="/jeremiah/23-28.htm">Jeremiah 23:28</a>; there is no fear of God, nor knowledge of him and his will, nor faith in him, nor love to him, or any regard to his honour and glory; <p>yea, they are prophets of the deceit of their own hearts; they prophesy nothing but what their own deceitful hearts suggest to them, whereby they are deceived themselves, and deceive others, <a href="/2_timothy/3-13.htm">2 Timothy 3:13</a>. <p>(h)  "quousque?"

"Thus saith Jahveh of hosts: Hearken not unto the words of the prophets that prophesy unto you! They deceive you; a vision of their heart they speak, not out of the mouth of Jahveh. <a href="/jeremiah/23-17.htm">Jeremiah 23:17</a>.

But if they had stood in my counsel, they would publish my words to my people and bring them back from their evil way and from the evil of their doings."<p>The warning against these prophets is founded in <a href="/jeremiah/23-16.htm">Jeremiah 23:16</a> on the fact that they give out the thoughts of their own hearts to be divine revelation, and promise peace and prosperity to all stiff-necked sinners. &#1502;&#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, lit., they make you vain, i.e., make you to yield yourselves to vain delusion, seduce you to false confidence. This they do by their speaking visions, i.e., revelations of their heart, not what God has spoken, revealed to them. As an illustration of this, <a href="/jeremiah/23-17.htm">Jeremiah 23:17</a> tells that they prophesy continued peace or well-being to the despisers of God. The infin. abs. &#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1512; after the verb. fin. intimates the duration or repetition of the thing. &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; are words of the false prophets, with which they give out that their prophesyings are God's word. Since we nowhere else find sayings of Jahveh introduced by &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;, but usually by '&#1499;&#1468;&#1492; &#1488;&#1502;&#1512; &#1497;, the lxx have taken offence at that formula, and, reading &#1491;&#1489;&#1512;, join the words with &#1500;&#1502;&#1504;&#1488;&#1510;&#1497;: &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;. To this reading Hitz. and Gr. give the preference over the Masoretic; but they have not noticed that they thus get an unsuitable sense. For &#1491;&#1489;&#1512; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; in prophetic language never denotes the Mosaic law or the "moral law" (Hitz.), but the word of God published by the prophets. By their view of "word of Jahveh" they would here obtain the self-inconsistent thought: to the despisers of divine revelation they proclaim as revelation. The Masoretic reading is clearly right; and Jeremiah chose the unusual introductory formula to distinguish the language of the pseudo-prophets from that of the true prophets of the Lord. &#1493;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1500;&#1498; &#1489;' is prefixed absolutely: and as concerning every one that walks...they say, for: and to every one...they say. On the "stubbornness of their heart," see on <a href="/jeremiah/3-17.htm">Jeremiah 3:17</a>. With the speech of the false prophets, cf. <a href="/jeremiah/14-13.htm">Jeremiah 14:13</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/6-14.htm">Jeremiah 6:14</a>. - In <a href="/jeremiah/23-18.htm">Jeremiah 23:18</a> a more comprehensive reason is given to show that these prophets are not publishing God's decrees. The question: Who hath stood? has negative force  equals  None hath stood. By this Jeremiah does not deny the possibility of this universally, but only of the false prophets (Hitz.). This limitation of the words is suggested by the context. To the true prophets the Lord reveals His &#1505;&#1493;&#1491;, <a href="/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>. &#1493;&#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; are not to be taken jussively: let him see and hear (Hitz.), for the foregoing interrogation is not a conditional clause introducing a command. The imperfects with &#1493; are clauses of consequence or design, and after a preceding perfect should be rendered in English by the conditional of the pluperfect. Seeing the word of God refers to prophetic vision. The second question is appended without at all conveying any inference from what precedes; and in it the second verb (with &#1493; consec.) is simply a strengthening of the first: who hath hearkened to my word and heard it? The Masoretes have quite unnecessarily changed the Chet. &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497; .tehC  into &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1493;. In the graphic representation of the prophets, the transition to the direct speech of God, and conversely, is no unusual thing. The change of &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; into &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;, unnecessary and even improper as it is, is preferred by Graf and Ng., inasmuch as they take the interrogative &#1502;&#1497; in both clauses in the sense of quisquis and understand the verse thus: He who has but stood in the counsel of the Lord, let him see and hear His word (i.e., he must see and hear His word); and he that hath marked my word, let him publish it (i.e., he must publish it). This exposition becomes only then necessary, if we leave the context out of view and regard the question as being to the effect that no one has stood in God's counsel - which Jeremiah could not mean. Not to speak of the change of the text necessary for carrying it through, this view does not even give a suitable sense. If the clause: He that has stood in the counsel of the Lord, he must proclaim His word, is to be regarded as having a demonstrative force, then the principal idea must be supplied, thus namely: "and it is impossible that it should be favourable to those who despise it." In <a href="/jeremiah/23-19.htm">Jeremiah 23:19</a> Jeremiah publishes a real word of the Lord, which sounds very differently from the words of the false prophets. A tempest from Jahveh will burst over the heads of the evil-doers, and the wrath of God will not cease until it has accomplished the divine decree. "A tempest from Jahveh" is defined by "fury" in apposition as being a manifestation of God's wrath; and the whole first clause is further expanded in the second part of the verse. The tempest from Jahveh goes forth, i.e., breaks out, and as whirling tornado or eddying whirlwind bursts over the head of the wicked. &#1497;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500; is to be taken in accordance with &#1502;&#1514;&#1495;&#1493;&#1500;&#1500;: twist, whirl, cf. <a href="/2_samuel/3-29.htm">2 Samuel 3:29</a>. "The thoughts of His heart" must not be limited to what God has decreed de interitu populi (Calv.); it comprehends God's whole redemptive plan in His people's regard-not merely the overthrow of the kingdom of Judah, but also the purification of the people by means of judgments and the final glorification of His kingdom. To this future the next clause points: at the end of the days ye shall have clear knowledge of this. "The end of the days" is not merely the completion of the period in which we now are (Hitz., Gr. Ng., etc.), but, as universally, the end of the times, i.e., the Messianic future, the last period of the world's history which opens at the close of the present aeon; see on <a href="/genesis/49-1.htm">Genesis 49:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/24-14.htm">Numbers 24:14</a>, etc. &#1492;&#1514;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1504;&#1503; is strengthened by &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492; yb dene: attain to insight, come to clearer knowledge.</body></html>
