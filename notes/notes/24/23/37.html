The practice of these prophets is characterized in three ways, yet without marking out three classes of unworthy men. One habit of theirs is that of stealing the word of God one from another. Not inspired of God themselves, they tried to appropriate words of God from other prophets in order to give their own utterances the character of divine oracles. Another is: they take their tongues and say, God's word, i.e., they use their tongues to speak pretended words from God. The verb &#1497;&#1504;&#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468; occurs only here; elsewhere only the participle &#1504;&#1488;&#1501;, and that almost always joined with &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; in the sig. effatum Domini; here without it, but in the same sense. The root meaning of &#1504;&#1488;&#1501; is disputed. Connected etymologically with &#1504;&#1492;&#1501;, &#1492;&#1502;&#1492;, it doubtlessly denotes originally, that which is whispered, Jahveh's secret confidential communication; but it is constantly used, not for the word of God as silently inspired by God, but as softly uttered by the prophet. The meaning is not: their prophesying is "mere wagging of the tongue, talk according to their own caprice" (Graf); but: they give out their sayings for God's, whereas God speaks neither to nor by them. Finally, their third way of doing consists in feigning revelations by means of dreams, which are but deceptive dreams. At this point the discourse falls back on the description in <a href="/jeremiah/23-26.htm">Jeremiah 23:26</a>. The words "and lead my people astray" refer to all their three ways of acting before characterized. &#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; is their boasting of revelations from God.
