There, however, stress is laid chiefly on the fact of the exile, here on that of the restoration. The LXX. version omits them here, but inserts them, where they are obviously out of place, at the end of the chapter.

But here the passage seems to point more plainly than it did there to the days of the Messiah, and to compare, not so much the two deliverances themselves, giving the preference to the latter, as the two states to which the church should grow after those deliverances. About four hundred and eighty years after they were come out of Egypt, Solomon’s temple was built, <a href="/1_kings/6-1.htm" title="And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in the month Zif, which is the second month, that he began to build the house of the LORD.">1 Kings 6:1</a>; and at that time that nation, which was so wonderfully brought out of Egypt, was gradually arrived to its height. And four hundred and ninety years (seventy weeks) after they came out of Babylon, Messiah the Prince set up the gospel temple, which was the greatest glory of that nation that was so wonderfully brought out of Babylon: see <a href="/context/daniel/9-24.htm" title="Seventy weeks are determined on your people and on your holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy....">Daniel 9:24-25</a>. Now the spiritual glory of the second period of that nation, especially as transferred to the gospel church, is much more admirable and illustrious than all the temporal glory of the first period of it, in the days of Solomon; for that was no glory, compared with the glory which excelleth. Add to this, the prophet, it seems, also foretels a second gathering of the Jews from their dispersions, namely, one that should take place after the coming of the Messiah, and the ruin of their city and country by the Romans, and therefore yet future. Now this work of God, whenever it shall be effected, including, as it undoubtedly will, their conversion to Christianity, and perhaps, also, their restoration to their own land, will assuredly appear so wonderful as greatly to outshine every former deliverance wrought for that people, and therefore may well put every other out of remembrance. St. Paul calls this restoration of them, <span class="ital">life from the dead, </span>(<a href="/romans/9-25.htm" title="As he said also in Osee, I will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved.">Romans 9:25</a>,) meaning that it would be a miracle as surprising as the resurrection of a multitude of dead bodies.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/23.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>23:1-8 Woe be to those who are set to feed God's people, but take no concern to do them good! Here is a word of comfort to the neglected sheep. Though only a remnant of God's flock is left, he will find them out, and they shall be brought to their former habitations. Christ is spoken of as a branch from David's family. He is righteous himself, and through him all his people are made righteous. Christ shall break the usurped power of Satan. All the spiritual seed of believing Abraham and praying Jacob shall be protected, and shall be saved from the guilt and dominion of sin. In the days of Christ's government in the soul, the soul dwells at ease. He is here spoken of as the Lord our Righteousness. He is so our Righteousness as no creature could be. His obedience unto death is the justifying righteousness of believers, and their title to heavenly happiness. And their sanctification, as the source of all their personal obedience is the effect of their union with him, and of the supply of this Spirit. By this name every true believer shall call him, and call upon him. We have nothing to plead but this, Christ has died, yea, rather is risen again; and we have taken him for our Lord. This righteousness which he has wrought out to the satisfaction of law and justice, becomes ours; being a free gift given to us, through the Spirit of God, who puts it upon us, clothes us with it, enables us to lay hold upon it, and claim an interest in it. The Lord our Righteousness is a sweet name to a convinced sinner; to one that has felt the guilt of sin in his conscience; seen his need of that righteousness, and the worth of it. This great salvation is far more glorious than all former deliverances of his church. May our souls be gathered to Him, and be found in him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This is his name whereby he shall be called - From remote antiquity the person here spoken of has been understood to be "the righteous germ," and this alone is in accordance with the grammar and the sense.

Repeated from Jer 16:14, 15. The prophet said the same things often, in order that his sayings might make the more impression. The same promise as in Jer 23:3, 4. The wide dispersion of the Jews at the Babylonish captivity prefigures their present wider dispersion (Isa 11:11; Joe 3:6). Their second deliverance is to exceed far the former one from Egypt. But the deliverance from Babylon was inferior to that from Egypt in respect to the miracles performed and the numbers delivered.

"Woe to shepherds that destroy and scatter the flock of my pasturing! saith Jahveh. <a href="/jeremiah/23-2.htm">Jeremiah 23:2</a>. Therefore thus saith Jahveh, the God of Israel, concerning the shepherds that feed my people: Ye have scattered my flock, and driven them away, and not visited them; behold, I will visit on you the evil of your doings, saith Jahveh. <a href="/jeremiah/23-3.htm">Jeremiah 23:3</a>. And I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all lands whither I have driven them, and bring them back to their pasture, that they may be fruitful and increase; <a href="/jeremiah/23-4.htm">Jeremiah 23:4</a>. And will raise up over them shepherds that shall feed them, and they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed, nor be lacking, saith Jahveh. <a href="/jeremiah/23-5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5</a>. Behold, days come, saith Jahveh, that I raise up unto David a righteous branch, that shall reign as king, and deal wisely, and do right and justice in the land. <a href="/jeremiah/23-6.htm">Jeremiah 23:6</a>.

Therefore, behold, days come, saith Jahveh, that they shall no more say: By the life of Jahveh who brought up the sons of Israel out of the land of Egypt, <a href="/jeremiah/23-8.htm">Jeremiah 23:8</a>. But: By the life of Jahveh who brought up and led forth the seed of the house of Israel out of the land towards midnight, and out of all the lands whither I had driven them, and they shall dwell in their own land."<p>This portion is the conclusion of the prophecy concerning the shepherds of Israel, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/22.htm">Jeremiah 22</a>. In <a href="/jeremiah/23-1.htm">Jeremiah 23:1</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/23-2.htm">Jeremiah 23:2</a> what has been foretold concerning the last kings of Judah is condensed into one general sentence, so as thus to form a point of connection for the declaration of salvation which follows at <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-3.htm">Jeremiah 23:3</a>, consisting in the gathering again of the people, neglected and scattered by the evil shepherds, by means of the righteous branch of David. The Lord cries woe upon the shepherds. &#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; without article, because the matter concerns all evil shepherds, and is not applied till <a href="/jeremiah/23-2.htm">Jeremiah 23:2</a> to the evil rulers of Judah. Venema rightly says: Generale vae pastoribus malis praemittitur, quod mox ad pastores Judae applicatur. It is so clear from the context as to have been generally admitted by recent comm., that by shepherds are meant not merely the false prophets and priests, nor even these along with the kings; cf. on <a href="/jeremiah/3-15.htm">Jeremiah 3:15</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/25-34.htm">Jeremiah 25:34</a>., and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/34.htm">Ezekiel 34</a>. The flock of my pasturing, in other words, the flock, which I feed; for &#1502;&#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1514; sig. both the feeding (cf. <a href="/hosea/13-6.htm">Hosea 13:6</a>) and the place where the flock feeds, cf. <a href="/jeremiah/25-36.htm">Jeremiah 25:36</a>; <a href="/psalms/74-1.htm">Psalm 74:1</a>. Israel is called the flock of Jahveh's pasturing inasmuch as He exerts a special care over it. The flock bad shepherds, the ungodly monarchs on the throne of David, have brought to ruin and scattered. The scattering is in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-2.htm">Jeremiah 23:2</a>, cf. with <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-3.htm">Jeremiah 23:3</a>, called a driving out into the lands; but the "destroying" must be discovered from the train of thought, for the clause: ye have not visited them (<a href="/jeremiah/23-2.htm">Jeremiah 23:2</a>), intimates merely their neglect of the sheep committed to their charge. What the "destroying" more especially is, we may gather from the conduct of King Jehoiakim, described in <a href="/jeremiah/22-13.htm">Jeremiah 22:13</a>.; it consists in oppression, violence, and the shedding of innocent blood; cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-2.htm">Ezekiel 34:2-3</a>. With &#1500;&#1499;&#1503;, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-2.htm">Jeremiah 23:2</a>, is made the application of the general sentence, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-1.htm">Jeremiah 23:1</a>, to the shepherds of Israel. Because they are such as have scattered, driven away, and not visited the flock of the Lord, therefore He will punish in them the wickedness of their doings. In the &#1500;&#1488; &#1508;&#1511;&#1491;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501; &#1488;&#1514;&#1501; is summed up all that the rulers have omitted to do for the flock committed to their care; cf. the specification of what they have not done, <a href="/ezekiel/34-4.htm">Ezekiel 34:4</a>. It was their duty, as Ven. truly says, to see ut vera religio, pabulum populi spiritual, recte et rite exerceretur. Instead of this, they have, by introducing idolatry, directly encouraged ungodliness, and the immorality which flows therefrom. Here in "ye have not visited them" we have the negative moment made prominent, so that in <a href="/jeremiah/23-3.htm">Jeremiah 23:3</a> may follow what the Lord will do for His scattered flock. Cf. the further expansion of this promise in <a href="/ezekiel/34-12.htm">Ezekiel 34:12</a>. We must note "I have driven them," since in <a href="/jeremiah/23-2.htm">Jeremiah 23:2</a> it was said that the bad shepherds had driven the flock away. The one does not exclude the other. By their corrupting the people, the wicked shepherds had occasioned the driving out; and this God has inflicted on the people as punishment. But the people, too, had their share in the guilt; but to this attention is not here directed, since the question deals only with the shepherds. </body></html>
