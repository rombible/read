In words in which the natural impatience of suffering shows itself as clearly as in the complaints of Psalms 69, 109, he asks that the judgment may be immediate, open, terrible. As if recalling the very phrase which he had himself but lately used (<a href="/jeremiah/11-19.htm" title="But I was like a lamb or an ox that is brought to the slaughter; and I knew not that they had devised devices against me, saying, Let us destroy the tree with the fruit thereof, and let us cut him off from the land of the living, that his name may be no more remembered.">Jeremiah 11:19</a>), he prays that they too may be as “sheep for the slaughter,” <span class= "ital">dragged </span>or <span class= "ital">torn away </span>from their security to the righteous penalty of their wrong.<p><span class= "bld">Prepare.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">devote. </span>The Hebrew word, as in <a href="/jeremiah/6-4.htm" title="Prepare you war against her; arise, and let us go up at noon.

When we find it hard to understand any of his dealings with us, or others, we must look to general truths as our first principles, and abide by them: the Lord is righteous. The God with whom we have to do, knows how our hearts are toward him. He knows both the guile of the hypocrite and the sincerity of the upright. Divine judgments would pull the wicked out of their pasture as sheep for the slaughter. This fruitful land was turned into barrenness for the wickedness of those that dwelt therein. The Lord reproved the prophet. The opposition of the men of Anathoth was not so formidable as what he must expect from the rulers of Judah. Our grief that there should be so much evil is often mixed with peevishness on account of the trials it occasions us. And in this our favoured day, and under our trifling difficulties, let us consider how we should behave, if called to sufferings like those of saints in former ages.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thou hast seen me ... - Rather, "Thou seest me and triest mine heart" at all times, and knowest the sincerity of its devotion" toward Thee."<p>Pull them out - The original is used <a href="/jeremiah/10-20.htm">Jeremiah 10:20</a> of the rending asunder of the cords of the tent, and <a href="/ezekiel/17-9.htm">Ezekiel 17:9</a> of the tearing up of roots.

The second half of the <span class="ital">v</span>. presents some difficulty. Jeremiah’s personal enemies have not yet been definitely mentioned, nor, if we take Co.’s view and place this passage (see on <a href="/context/jeremiah/11-18.htm" title="And the LORD has given me knowledge of it, and I know it: then you showed me their doings....">Jeremiah 11:18-23</a>) earlier, have they been even hinted at. If, on the other hand, it refers to the wicked generally, we may question whether Jeremiah drew a distinction between their coming fortunes and those of the nation as a whole. Co. accordingly agrees so far with Du. as to omit this part of the <span class="ital">v</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">pull them out</span>] a strong expression in the Hebrew.

This verse is repeated almost verbally in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-12.htm">Jeremiah 20:12</a>, and in substance in <a href="/jeremiah/17-10.htm">Jeremiah 17:10</a>. Who trieth reins and heart, and therefore knows that Jeremiah has done no evil. &#1488;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; is future as expressing certainty that God will interfere to punish; for to Him he has wholly committed his cause. &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497;, Pi. of &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;, is taken by Hitz., Ew., etc. in the sense of &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1500;: on Thee have I rolled over my cause; in support of this they adduce <a href="/psalms/22-9.htm">Psalm 22:9</a>; <a href="/psalms/37-5.htm">Psalm 37:5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/16-3.htm">Proverbs 16:3</a>, as parallel passages. It is true that this interpretation can be vindicated grammatically, for &#1490;&#1500;&#1500; might have assumed the form of &#1490;&#1500;&#1492; (Ew. 121, a). But the passages quoted are not at all decisive, since Jeremiah very frequently gives a new sense to quotations by making slight alterations on them; and in the passage cited we read &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1500; &#1488;&#1514; &#1512;&#1497;&#1489;. We therefore adhere, with Grot. and Ros., to the usual meaning of &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;; understanding that in making known there is included the idea of entrusting, a force suggested by the construction with &#1488;&#1500; instead of &#1500;. &#1512;&#1497;&#1489;, controversy, cause. - The prophet declares God's vengeance to the instigators of the plots against his life, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-21.htm">Jeremiah 11:21-23</a>. The introductory formula in <a href="/jeremiah/11-21.htm">Jeremiah 11:21</a> is repeated in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-22.htm">Jeremiah 11:22</a>, on account of the long intervening parenthesis. "That thou diest not" is introduced by the &#1493; of consecution. The punishment is to fall upon the entire population of Anathoth; on the young men of military age (&#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;), a violent death in war; on the children, death by famine consequent on the siege. Even though all had not had a share in the complot, yet were they at heart just as much alienated from God and ill-disposed towards His word. "Year of their visitation" is still dependent on "bring." This construction is simpler than taking &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1514; for accus. adverb., both here and in <a href="/jeremiah/23-12.htm">Jeremiah 23:12</a>. </body></html>
