Here the image (as in <a href="/jeremiah/6-3.htm" title="The shepherds with their flocks shall come to her; they shall pitch their tents against her round about; they shall feed every one in his place.">Jeremiah 6:3</a>) is that of the <span class= "ital">shepherds </span>of a wild, nomadic tribe (who represent the Chaldean and other invaders), breaking down the fence of the vineyard, and taking in their flocks to browse upon the tender shoots of the vine. The thought is the same as that of the “boar out of the wood” of <a href="/psalms/80-13.htm" title="The boar out of the wood does waste it, and the wild beast of the field does devour it.">Psalm 80:13</a>, but the “shepherds” are introduced to bring in the thought of the organisation and systematic plan of destruction.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/12.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/jeremiah/12-10.htm" title="Many pastors have destroyed my vineyard, they have trodden my portion under foot, they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness....">Jeremiah 12:10-11</a></span>. <span class="ital">Many pastures have destroyed my vineyard — Many eaters, </span>or <span class="ital">devourers, </span>as Dr. Waterland translates <span class="greekheb">רעים רבים</span>, by which the Chaldee Paraphrast understands the generals of the Chaldean army, an interpretation which seems to be justified by the two following verses: though some explain it of the rulers of the Jews, who, by their wicked government, and equally wicked example, had ruined their country.

Many professing churches become like speckled birds, presenting a mixture of religion and the world, with its vain fashions, pursuits, and pollutions. God's people are as men wondered at, as a speckled bird; but this people had by their own folly made themselves so; and the beasts and birds are called to prey upon them. The whole land would be made desolate. But until the judgments were actually inflicted, none of the people would lay the warning to heart. When God's hand is lifted up, and men will not see, they shall be made to feel. Silver and gold shall not profit in the day of the Lord's anger.

The favorite way of representing Jehovah's relation to his people is that of a vine-proprietor to his vineyard (see on Jeremiah 2:21). How would a vineyard be ruined if a band of shepherds were to drive their flocks among the tender vine-shoots! <span class="cmt_word">The many pastors</span> (or, <span class="accented">shepherds</span>) are clearly Nebuchadnezzar and his generals (comp. <a href="/jeremiah/6-3.htm">Jeremiah 6:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">My pleasant portion</span>. Jehovah is the "portion" of his people; his people and its land are the "portion" of Jehovah (see on Jeremiah 10:16). The epithet "pleasant" expresses the emotion of the surprised speaker. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div><a href="/jeremiah/12-4.htm">Jeremiah 12:4</a> gives the motive of his prayer: How long shall the earth suffer from the wickedness of these hypocrites? be visited with drought and dearth for their sins? This question is not to be taken as a complaint that God is punishing without end; Hitz. so takes it, and then proposes to delete it as being out of all connection in sense with <a href="/jeremiah/12-3.htm">Jeremiah 12:3</a> or <a href="/jeremiah/12-5.htm">Jeremiah 12:5</a>. It is a complaint because of the continuance of God's chastisement, drawn down by the wickedness of the apostates, which are bringing the land to utter ruin. The mourning of the land and the withering of the herb is a consequence of great drought; and the drought is a divine chastisement: cf. <a href="/jeremiah/3-3.htm">Jeremiah 3:3</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/5-24.htm">Jeremiah 5:24</a>., <a href="/jeremiah/14-2.htm">Jeremiah 14:2</a>., etc. But this falls not only on the unfaithful, but upon the godly too, and even the beasts, cattle, and birds suffer from it; and so the innocent along with the guilty. There seems to be injustice in this. To put an end to this injustice, to rescue the innocent from the curse brought by the wickedness of the ungodly, the prophet seeks the destruction of the wicked. &#1505;&#1508;&#1492;, to be swept away. The 3rd pers. fem. sing. with the plural &#1493;&#1514;-, as in <a href="/joel/1-20.htm">Joel 1:20</a> and often; cf. Ew. 317, a, Gesen. 146, 3. "They that dwell therein" are inhabitants of the land at large, the ungodly multitude of the people, of whom it is said in the last clause: they say, He will not see our end. The sense of these words is determined by the subject. Many follow the lxx (&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3bf;&#788; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#788;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;) and refer the seeing to God. God will not see their end, i.e., will not trouble Himself about it (Schnur., Ros., and others), or will not pay any heed to their future fate, so that they may do all they choose unpunished (Ew.). But to this Graf has justly objected, that &#1512;&#1488;&#1492;, in all the passages that can be cited for this sense of the word, is used only of that which God sees, regards as already present, never of that which is future. "He sees" is to be referred to the prophet. Of him the ungodly say, he shall not see their end, because they intend to put him out of the way (Hitz.); or better, in a less special sense, they ridicule the idea that his prophecies will be fulfilled, and say: He shall not see our end, because his threatenings will not come to pass.</body></html>
