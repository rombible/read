When we find it hard to understand any of his dealings with us, or others, we must look to general truths as our first principles, and abide by them: the Lord is righteous. The God with whom we have to do, knows how our hearts are toward him. He knows both the guile of the hypocrite and the sincerity of the upright. Divine judgments would pull the wicked out of their pasture as sheep for the slaughter. This fruitful land was turned into barrenness for the wickedness of those that dwelt therein. The Lord reproved the prophet. The opposition of the men of Anathoth was not so formidable as what he must expect from the rulers of Judah. Our grief that there should be so much evil is often mixed with peevishness on account of the trials it occasions us. And in this our favoured day, and under our trifling difficulties, let us consider how we should behave, if called to sufferings like those of saints in former ages.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Their veins - i. e., their heart.

They are determined not to hear the word of God, chiding and punishing them for their sins, and so to put the preacher of this word out of the way. - <a href="/jeremiah/11-18.htm">Jeremiah 11:18</a>.

And a remnant shall not remain to them; for I bring evil upon the men of Anathoth, the year of their visitation."<p>Jeremiah had not himself observed the designs of the people of Anathoth against his life, because the thing was carried on in secret; but the Lord made it known to him. &#1488;&#1494;, then, sc. when I knew nought of their murderous intent; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/11-19.htm">Jeremiah 11:19</a>.

In like manner Jeremiah had no suspicion that his countrymen were harbouring evil designs against him. These designs are quoted directly without &#1500;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;. The saying is a figurative or proverbial one: we will destroy the tree &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1495;&#1502;&#1493;. This word is variously taken. The ordinary meaning, food for men and beasts, usually bread, seems not to be suitable. And so Hitz. wishes to read &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1495;&#1493;, in its sap (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/34-7.htm">Deuteronomy 34:7</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/21-3.htm">Ezekiel 21:3</a>), because &#1500;&#1495;&#1501; may mean grain, but it does not mean fruit. Ng. justly remarks against this view: What is here essential is simply the produce of the tree, furnished for the use of man. The word of the prophet was a food which they abhorred (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/11-21.htm">Jeremiah 11:21</a>). As &#1500;&#1495;&#1501; originally meant food, we here understand by it the edible product of the tree, that is, its fruit, in opposition to sap, wood, leaves. This interpretation is confirmed by the Arabic; the Arabs use both lahu&#770;mun and ukulu of the fruit of a tree, see ill. in Rosenm. Schol. ad h. l. The proverbial saying is given in plain words in the next clause. We will cut him (i.e., the prophet) off, etc.</body></html>
