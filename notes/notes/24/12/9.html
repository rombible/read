The image was probably suggested by something the prophet had observed, birds of prey of one species collecting and attacking a solitary stranger of another, joined by the “beasts of the field,” the wolves and jackals and hyænas, who scent their prey. The word “speckled,” perhaps, points to the bird attacked as being of more goodly plumage than the others (one, it may be, of the kingfishers that abound in Palestine), and therefore treated as a stranger and an enemy. The fact is one which strikes every observer of bird life (Tac. <span class= "ital">Ann. </span>vi. 28; Sueton. <span class= "ital">Cæs. </span>c. 81).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/12.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>12:7-13 God's people had been the dearly-beloved of his soul, precious in his sight, but they acted so, that he gave them up to their enemies. Many professing churches become like speckled birds, presenting a mixture of religion and the world, with its vain fashions, pursuits, and pollutions. God's people are as men wondered at, as a speckled bird; but this people had by their own folly made themselves so; and the beasts and birds are called to prey upon them. The whole land would be made desolate. But until the judgments were actually inflicted, none of the people would lay the warning to heart. When God's hand is lifted up, and men will not see, they shall be made to feel. Silver and gold shall not profit in the day of the Lord's anger. And the efforts of sinners to escape misery, without repentance and works answerable thereto, will end in confusion.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Rather, "Is My heritage unto Me as a speckled bird?

By "a speckled" or parti-colored "bird" is probably meant some kind of vulture. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. speckled bird&#8212;Many translate, "a ravenous beast, the hyena"; the corresponding Arabic word means hyena; so the Septuagint. But the Hebrew always elsewhere means "a bird of prey." The Hebrew for "speckled" is from a root "to color"; answering to the Jewish blending together with paganism the altogether diverse Mosaic ritual. The neighboring nations, birds of prey like herself (for she had sinfully assimilated herself to them), were ready to pounce upon her.<p>assemble &#8230; beasts of &#8230; field&#8212;The Chaldeans are told to gather the surrounding heathen peoples as allies against Judah (Isa 56:9; Eze 34:5).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Mine heritage is unto me as a speckled bird:</span> the word in the Hebrew signifies to dye, or colour, and interpreters are here divided, whether to interpret it of a bird <span class="ital">coloured by nature</span> (so our translators understood it, and therefore have translated it <span class="ital">speckled</span>) or <span class="ital">by accident</span>, as ravenous birds are coloured by the blood of other birds killed by them. Hence some interpret the text as a reflection upon the Jews for their cruelty, coloured by their oppression and innocent bloodshed. Others, of their tincture by a variety of superstition and idolatry. The latter seemeth to me most probable, because of what follows, it being what is usual and natural for other birds to flock about a strange-coloured bird, such as they have not been used to see, but rather to fly from, than to come at a bird of prey, that hath already stained her feathers with the blood of other birds. But it may be understood of either, for the Jews were notoriously guilty of both, and it is God that causeth the birds to come against her, and the beasts of the field to devour. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Mine heritage is unto me as a speckled bird,.... Or, "is not mine heritage unto me as a speckled bird?" (b) as a bird of various colours, delightful to look at, as the peacock, so Jerom interprets it here; it was so formerly, but not so now; or as a bird of various colours, and unusual, which other birds get about, look on, hate, and peck at. Some think this refers to the motley party coloured religion the Jews had embraced, consisting of various rites and ceremonies of the Heathens; on which account they thought they looked beautiful and comely, when they were hated and rejected of God for them; but the word signifies rather to be dipped or stained, as with blood, and so denotes a bird of prey that is stained with the blood of others; a fit emblem of the cruelty of the Jews, in shedding the blood of the prophets. Some, because a word near akin to this signifies a finger, render it a "fingered bird" (c); that is, a bird with talons or claws; like fingers, a ravenous bird, and it comes to the same sense as before. But the Septuagint take it, to be not a bird, but a beast, and render it by the hyena; and which Bochart (d) approves of, since the word in the Arabic language signifies such a creature; and Schindler observes, that  with the Arabians, is the name of a creature between a wolf and a middling dog, which agrees with the hyena. The word here used, in the Talmudic (e) language signifies a she leopard or panther, so called from its variety of spots; and is the same, as Maimonides says (f), which, in the Arabic language, is called  with the Targumists it is used for a kind of serpents or vipers. So the valley of Tzeboim is rendered, in the Targum, the valley of vipers, <a href="/1_samuel/13-18.htm">1 Samuel 13:18</a>. And it is said (g),  the word in the text, <p>"this is from a white drop (or seed), and yet it has three hundred and sixty five kinds of colours, according to the number of the days of a solar year.'' <p>The birds round about are against her; or, "are not the birds round about against her?" the birds of prey? they are; meaning the neighbouring nations, that under Nebuchadnezzar came up against Jerusalem to take and destroy it. <p>Come ye, assemble all ye beasts of the field, come to devour; this is an invitation to the enemies of the people of the Jews, comparable for their fierceness and savageness to the beasts of the field, to come and destroy them; and shows that their destruction was by divine permission, and according to the will of God. Compare with this <a href="/revelation/19-18.htm">Revelation 19:18</a>. The Targum interprets it of those that kill with the sword; kings of the earth, and their armies. <p>(b) So V. L.

Are birds of prey round about her?</span> The passage is difficult, but the following seems the most plausible explanation: - Jehovah is represented as surprised to see his chosen people a prey to the heathen (a strongly anthropomorphic description, as if Jehovah had not anticipated that his "giving up" his people would have such sad results). It seems to him (adopting human modes of speech) as if Israel were "a colored bird of prey," the bright plumage of which excites the animosity of its less brilliant comrades, who gather round it and pull it to pieces. It is an allusion to the phenomenon, well-known to the ancients (Tacit., 'Ann.' 6:28; Suet., 'Caes.,' 81; Plin.,' Hist. Nat.,' 10:19), of birds gathering round and attacking a strange-looking bird appearing in their midst. The prophet might have simply said "a bird;" why does he say "a bird of prey ('<span class="accented">ayit</span>)"? Probably because he has just described the hostile attitude of Israel towards Jehovah under the figure of a lion. Some particular, rare kind of vulture seems to be intended. Sennacherib apparently uses a cognate word ('it) for the vulture ('Taylor Cylinder,' 3. 68). Bochart and Gesenius, following the Septuagint, think "hyena," and not "bird of prey," is the right rendering in the first clause; but Gesenius does not offer any other passage for the meaning <span class="accented">bestia</span> <span class="accented">rapax</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Come ye, assemble all the beasts of the field</span>. There is a parallel passage in <a href="/isaiah/56-9.htm">Isaiah 56:9</a>, where, as here, the "beasts of the field (<span class="accented">i.e. the wild</span> beasts of the open country) are the heathen powers employed as God's instruments for chastising Israel (comp. also <a href="/ezekiel/34-5.htm">Ezekiel 34:5</a>, where the same figure occurs). "The prophet adopts the strongest way of expressing that Israel, utterly bereft of his natural defenders, lies at the mercy of the great heathen empire" (note on Isaiah 56:9). <span class="cmt_word">Come to devour</span>; rather, <span class="accented">bring them to devour</span>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>To show that he has cause for his question, Jeremiah appeals to the omniscience of the Searcher of hearts. God knows him, tries his heart, and therefore knows how it is disposed towards Himself (&#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1498; belongs to &#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;, and &#1488;&#1514; indicating the relation - here, viz., fidelity - in which the heart stands to God; cf. <a href="/2_samuel/16-17.htm">2 Samuel 16:17</a>). Thus God knows that in his heart there is no unfaithfulness, and that he maintains to God an attitude altogether other than that of those hypocrites who have God on their lips only; and knows too the enmity which, without having provoked it, he experiences. How then comes it about that with the prophet it goes ill, while with those faithless ones it goes well? God, as the righteous God, must remove this contradiction. And so his request concludes: Tear them out (&#1504;&#1514;&#1511; of the tearing out of roots, <a href="/ezekiel/17-9.htm">Ezekiel 17:9</a>); here Hiph. with the same force (pointing back to the metaphor of their being rooted, <a href="/jeremiah/12-2.htm">Jeremiah 12:2</a>), implying total destruction. Hence also the illustration: as sheep, that are dragged away out of the flock to be slaughtered. Devote them for the day of slaughter, like animals devoted to sacrifice.</body></html>
