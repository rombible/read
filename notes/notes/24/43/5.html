They preferred their own wisdom to the revealed will of God. Men deny the Scriptures to be the word of God, because they are resolved not to conform themselves to Scripture rules. When men will persist in sin, they charge the best actions to bad motives. These Jews deserted their own land, and threw themselves out of God's protection.

Though it is certain that Jeremiah and Baruch were not willing to go along with them, and probably that many of the people were not willing, yet these rebellious captains forced them all along with them, so as many of them were now a kind of prisoners to their own countrymen. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/43.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces,....

Ewald, 345, b. All the men who set their faces, i.e., intend, to go to Egypt shall perish; not a single one shall escape the evil; for the same judgment of wrath which has befallen Jerusalem shall also come on those who flee to Egypt; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/7-20.htm">Jeremiah 7:20</a>. On the expression "ye shall become a curse," etc., cf. <a href="/jeremiah/24-9.htm">Jeremiah 24:9</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/25-18.htm">Jeremiah 25:18</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/29-18.htm">Jeremiah 29:18</a>.<p>Taking for granted that the leaders of the people will not obey, Jeremiah appends to the word of the Lord an earnest address, in which several points are specially insisted on, viz., that the Lord had spoken to them, that He had forbidden them to go to Egypt, and that he (the prophet), by proclaiming the word of the Lord, had warned them (&#1492;&#1506;&#1497;&#1491; &#1489;&#1468;, to testify, bear witness against a person, i.e., warn him of something, cf. <a href="/jeremiah/11-7.htm">Jeremiah 11:7</a>). Thus he discloses to them the dangerous mistake they are in, when they first desire some expression of the mind of the Lord regarding their intentions, and, in the hope that He will accede to their request, promise unconditional obedience to whatever He may direct, but afterwards, when they have received a message from the Lord, will not obey it, because it is contrary to what they wish. The Kethib &#1492;&#1514;&#1506;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501; has been incorrectly written for &#1492;&#1514;&#1506;&#1497;&#1497;&#1501;, the Hiphil from &#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492;, to err; here, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/10-17.htm">Proverbs 10:17</a>, it means to make a mistake. &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501;, not, "you mislead your own selves," decepistis animas vestras (Vulg.), nor "in your souls," - meaning, in your thoughts and intentions (Ngelsbach), - but "at the risk of your souls," your life; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/17-21.htm">Jeremiah 17:21</a>. &#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1499;&#1500; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; (<a href="/jeremiah/42-21.htm">Jeremiah 42:21</a>), "and that in regard to all that for which Jahveh has sent me to you," points back to their promise, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/42-5.htm">Jeremiah 42:5</a>, that they would do "according to all the word." By employing the perfect in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/42-20.htm">Jeremiah 42:20</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/42-21.htm">Jeremiah 42:21</a>, the thing is represented as quite certain, as if it had already taken place. <a href="/jeremiah/42-22.htm">Jeremiah 42:22</a> concludes the warning with a renewed threat of the destruction which shall befall them for their disobedience. </body></html>
