Here the context shows that it was the name of an Egyptian city. The LXX. renders the words “he shall break the pillars of Heliopolis, which are in On,” and so identifies it with the city of that name on the Pelusiac branch of the Nile, just below the point of the Delta, and about twenty miles north-east of Memphis.

Ephraim Syrus says, the statue rose to the height of sixty cubits; the base was ten cubits. Above there was a miter of a thousand pounds weight. Hieroglyphics are traced around the only obelisk remaining in the present day, sixty or seventy feet high. On the fifth year after the overthrow of Jerusalem, Nebuchadnezzar, leaving the siege of Tyre, undertook his expedition to Egypt [Josephus, Antiquities, 10.9,7]. The Egyptians, according to the Arabs, have a tradition that their land was devastated by Nebuchadnezzar in consequence of their king having received the Jews under his protection, and that it lay desolate forty years. But see on [965]Eze 29:2; Eze 29:13.<p>shall he burn&#8212;Here the act is attributed to Nebuchadnezzar, the instrument, which in Jer 43:12 is attributed to God.

God threatens not only the destruction of the idolatrous temples, but the houses of the inhabitants of Egypt. by the king of Babylon; from whence these Jews, would they have believed, might have understood, that they would not have the security which they promised themselves in the land of Egypt. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/43.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>He shall break also the images of Bethshemesh, that is in the land of Egypt,.... Or, "of Heliopolis", as the Septuagint; the "city of the sun"; and so "Bethshemesh" here signifies the "house of the sun"; either it designs the temple of the sun, or the city where it was worshipped; as Heliopolis was famous for the worship of the sun, and for a magnificent temple in it, built for that purpose, and where abundance of persons resorted on that account, as Herodotus (l) observes; here were many images of the sun; and these now should be broke to pieces, when this city should become the city of destruction, as is foretold it should by Isaiah, <a href="/isaiah/19-18.htm">Isaiah 19:18</a>; where the Targum expressly calls it the city Bethshemesh, that is to be destroyed; See Gill on <a href="/isaiah/19-18.htm">Isaiah 19:18</a>. This is the same city that was formerly called On, and had a priest in Joseph's time, <a href="/genesis/41-45.htm">Genesis 41:45</a>; <p>and the houses of the gods of the Egyptians shall he burn with fire; which is repeated, that it might be taken notice of, and for the confirmation of it; though the words may be rendered, so as to remove the tautology, "and with the houses of the gods of the Egyptians shall he burn it with fire" (m); that is, Bethshemesh, or "the house of the sun", that shall not escape, being a principal temple. The gods they worshipped were Mnevis and Apis, which were oxen consecrated to the sun and moon (n). So says Porphyry (o), speaking of the Egyptians, <p>"they consecrate oxen to the sun and moon: that which is sacred to the sun at Heliopolis is called Mnevis, and is the greatest of them: it is very black, because much sun makes human bodies black; and the hairs of its tail, and of its whole body, contrary to other oxen, turn upwards, as the sun makes its course contrary to the pole; its testicles are the largest, because by the heat of the sun venereal desires are excited; hence the sun is said to make nature fruitful. To the moon they dedicate Taurus (or the bull), which they call Apis, and is blacker than others, bearing the signs of the sun and moon, because the light of the moon is from the sun; and the sign of the sun is the blackness of its body, and also the beetle that is under its tongue;'' <p>and these were the images and gods of Bethshemesh or Heliopolis, that were to be destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar. Of his expedition into Egypt, whereby this prophecy was fulfilled, not only Josephus makes mention, but some Heathen writers gave plain hints of it. The Jewish historian says (p), that Nebuchadnezzar, five years after the destruction of Jerusalem, led his army into Coelesyria, and took it; and made war with the Ammonites and Moabites; and, having subdued these nations, made a push into Egypt, in order to destroy that, and slew the king of it: and Berosus says (q), that <p>"Nebuchadnezzar having settled his affairs in Egypt, and other countries; and having committed to his friends the captives of the Jews, Phoenicians, Syrians, and the nations about Egypt, went to Babylon:'' <p>and Megasthenes (r) relates, that <p>"he conquered the greatest part of Lybia (or Africa) and Iberia;'' <p>or, as it is elsewhere (s) expressed, <p>"he led his army into Lybia and Iberia; and, having subdued these, carried colonies of them to the right of Pontus.'' <p>(l) Euterpe, sive l. 2. c. 59.

Only one of those of Heliopolis is still standing, though that, indeed, is the oldest in Egypt, for it was "set up at least four thousand years ago" (R. S. Poole, 'The Cities of Egypt,' p. 131). That is in the land of Egypt. To distinguish it from the Beth-shemesh in Palestine. But we may also render "which are," etc.; comp. "the gods of Egypt" in the second verse half.

In this enumeration of those who were conducted to Egypt, Hitzig, Graf, and others distinguish two classes: (1) the men, women, children, etc., who had been in Mizpah with Gedaliah, and had been led to Gibeon, after the murder of the latter, by Ishmael, but had afterwards been brought to Bethlehem by Johanan and the other captains (<a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-6.htm">Jeremiah 43:6</a>, cf. <a href="/jeremiah/40-7.htm">Jeremiah 40:7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-10.htm">Jeremiah 41:10</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/41-16.htm">Jeremiah 41:16</a>); (2) those who had returned from the foreign countries whither they had fled, but who had hitherto lived in the country, scattered here and there, and who must have joined the company led by Johanan to Bethlehem during the ten days of halt at that resting-place (<a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-5.htm">Jeremiah 43:5</a>, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-11.htm">Jeremiah 40:11-12</a>). There is no foundation, however, for this distinction. Neither in the present chapter is there anything mentioned of those who had been dispersed through the land joining those who had marched to Bethlehem; nor are the Jews who had returned from Moab, Ammon, Edom, and other countries to their own home distinguished, in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/40.htm">Jeremiah 40</a> and 41, as a different class from those who had been with Gedaliah in Mizpah; but on the other hand, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-12.htm">Jeremiah 40:12</a>, these returned Jews also came to Gedaliah at Mizpah, and gathered grapes and fruit. Besides, in these verses the distinction can only be made after the insertion into the text of the conjunction &#1493; before &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;. To "all the remnant of Judah who had returned from the nations" belong the men, women, children, etc., whom Nebuzaradan had committed to the care of Gedaliah. The enumeration in <a href="/jeremiah/43-6.htm">Jeremiah 43:6</a> gives only one specification of the "whole remnant of Judah," as in <a href="/jeremiah/41-16.htm">Jeremiah 41:16</a>. "And all the souls;" as if it were said, "and whoever else was still left alive;" cf. <a href="/joshua/10-28.htm">Joshua 10:28</a>. Tahpanhes was a frontier town of Egypt on the Pelusian branch of the Nile, and named &#x394;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; by the Greeks; see on <a href="/jeremiah/2-16.htm">Jeremiah 2:16</a>. Here, on the borders of Egypt, a halt was made, for the purpose of coming to further resolutions regarding their residence in that country. Here, too, Jeremiah received a revelation from God regarding the fate now impending on Egypt. </body></html>
