Azariah (or, more correctly, Jezaniah) occupies the last place in the enumeration of the captains, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-8.htm">Jeremiah 40:8</a>, and in <a href="/jeremiah/42-1.htm">Jeremiah 42:1</a> is also named after Johanan, who is the only one specially mentioned, in what follows, as the leader on the march. From this we may safely conclude that Jezaniah was the chief speaker and the leader of the opposition against the prophet. To avoid any reference to the promise they had made to obey the will of God, they declare that Jeremiah's prophecy is an untruth, which had been suggested to him, not by God, but by his attendant Baruch, with the view of delivering up the people to the Chaldeans. </body></html>
