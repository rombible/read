When Jeremiah went into the land of Egypt, not out of choice, but by constraint, God withdrew not his wonted favour from him. And what he received of the Lord he delivered to the people. Wherever we are, we must endeavour to do good; for that is our business in this world. <span class="ital">Saying, Take great stones in thy hand — </span>Such as are used as foundation-stones; <span class="ital">and hide them in the clay in the brick-kiln </span>— Or <span class="ital">furnace. </span>The Vulgate reads, <span class="ital">in crypta, quæ est sub muro lateritio, in the hollow place, </span>or <span class="ital">vault, which is under the brick wall; </span>and the LXX., <span class="greekheb">εν προθυροις</span>, <span class="ital">in the place before the gate which is at the entry of Pharaoh’s house — </span>Which, however, might be a great way from the palace itself; the courts of great kings being almost equal to a city, for extent, in ancient times: particularly the palace of Babylon was four miles in compass, according to Diodorus Siculus: <span class="ital">in the sight of the men of Judah </span>— Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">אנשׁים יהודים</span>, literally, <span class="ital">of men Jews; </span>which signifies indefinitely <span class="ital">some </span>of that nation; not as in our present translation, which seems to imply, that the presence of all the Jewish emigrantswas required; for in that case the reading would at least have been, with the definite article prefixed, <span class="greekheb">האנשׁים היהודים</span>, <span class="ital">the men the Jews, </span>see Blaney. Jeremiah was not ordered to place these stones thus in the presence of the Egyptians, who were unacquainted with his prophetic character, but in the sight of the Jews to whom he was sent; at least some of them, who might attest what they had seen to others; in order that, since he could not prevent their going into Egypt, he might bring them to repent of their going.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/43.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>43:8-13 God can find his people wherever they are. The Spirit of prophecy was not confined to the land of Israel. It is foretold that Nebuchadnezzar should destroy and carry into captivity many of the Egyptians. Thus God makes one wicked man, or wicked nation, a scourge and plague to another.

Azariah (or, more correctly, Jezaniah) occupies the last place in the enumeration of the captains, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-8.htm">Jeremiah 40:8</a>, and in <a href="/jeremiah/42-1.htm">Jeremiah 42:1</a> is also named after Johanan, who is the only one specially mentioned, in what follows, as the leader on the march. From this we may safely conclude that Jezaniah was the chief speaker and the leader of the opposition against the prophet. To avoid any reference to the promise they had made to obey the will of God, they declare that Jeremiah's prophecy is an untruth, which had been suggested to him, not by God, but by his attendant Baruch, with the view of delivering up the people to the Chaldeans. </body></html>
