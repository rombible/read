This minute circumstance is particularly foretold, that, when it was accomplished, they might be put in mind of the prophecy, and confirmed in their belief of the extent and certainty of the divine prescience; to which the smallest and most contingent events are evident.

In this enumeration of those who were conducted to Egypt, Hitzig, Graf, and others distinguish two classes: (1) the men, women, children, etc., who had been in Mizpah with Gedaliah, and had been led to Gibeon, after the murder of the latter, by Ishmael, but had afterwards been brought to Bethlehem by Johanan and the other captains (<a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-6.htm">Jeremiah 43:6</a>, cf. <a href="/jeremiah/40-7.htm">Jeremiah 40:7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-10.htm">Jeremiah 41:10</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/41-16.htm">Jeremiah 41:16</a>); (2) those who had returned from the foreign countries whither they had fled, but who had hitherto lived in the country, scattered here and there, and who must have joined the company led by Johanan to Bethlehem during the ten days of halt at that resting-place (<a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-5.htm">Jeremiah 43:5</a>, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-11.htm">Jeremiah 40:11-12</a>). There is no foundation, however, for this distinction. Neither in the present chapter is there anything mentioned of those who had been dispersed through the land joining those who had marched to Bethlehem; nor are the Jews who had returned from Moab, Ammon, Edom, and other countries to their own home distinguished, in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/40.htm">Jeremiah 40</a> and 41, as a different class from those who had been with Gedaliah in Mizpah; but on the other hand, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-12.htm">Jeremiah 40:12</a>, these returned Jews also came to Gedaliah at Mizpah, and gathered grapes and fruit. Besides, in these verses the distinction can only be made after the insertion into the text of the conjunction &#1493; before &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;. To "all the remnant of Judah who had returned from the nations" belong the men, women, children, etc., whom Nebuzaradan had committed to the care of Gedaliah. The enumeration in <a href="/jeremiah/43-6.htm">Jeremiah 43:6</a> gives only one specification of the "whole remnant of Judah," as in <a href="/jeremiah/41-16.htm">Jeremiah 41:16</a>. "And all the souls;" as if it were said, "and whoever else was still left alive;" cf. <a href="/joshua/10-28.htm">Joshua 10:28</a>. Tahpanhes was a frontier town of Egypt on the Pelusian branch of the Nile, and named &#x394;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; by the Greeks; see on <a href="/jeremiah/2-16.htm">Jeremiah 2:16</a>. Here, on the borders of Egypt, a halt was made, for the purpose of coming to further resolutions regarding their residence in that country. Here, too, Jeremiah received a revelation from God regarding the fate now impending on Egypt. </body></html>
