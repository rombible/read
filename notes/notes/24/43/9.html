It seems better, with Hitzig, Furst, and others, to take the Hebrew word, which occurs only here and in <a href="/2_samuel/12-31.htm" title="And he brought forth the people that were therein, and put them under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brick-kiln: and thus did he to all the cities of the children of Ammon.

Assyrian and Babylonian monuments present many instances of kings thus seated. As making his prediction more vivid, the prophet places stones in the <span class= "ital">mortar </span>or <span class= "ital">cement </span>(not “clay”) with which the mass was covered, and conceals them apparently with a fresh coat of mortar. There they were to remain till his prediction should be fulfilled. The symbolic act was of the same type as the breaking of the potter’s vessel in <a href="/jeremiah/19-10.htm" title="Then shall you break the bottle in the sight of the men that go with you,">Jeremiah 19:10</a>, and the yoke worn on the prophet’s shoulders (<a href="/jeremiah/27-2.htm" title="Thus said the LORD to me; Make you bonds and yokes, and put them on your neck,">Jeremiah 27:2</a>), and Ezekiel’s digging through the wall (<a href="/ezekiel/12-7.htm" title="And I did so as I was commanded: I brought forth my stuff by day, as stuff for captivity, and in the even I dig through the wall with my hand; I brought it forth in the twilight, and I bore it on my shoulder in their sight.">Ezekiel 12:7</a>). It may be noted that our version follows Luther in translating “brickkiln.” The LXX. evades the difficulty by taking refuge in vague terms” in the vestibule (<span class= "greekheb">πρόθυρα</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>in the gate of the house,” and the Vulgate gives “in the crypt which is under the brick walls.”<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/43.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>43:8-13 God can find his people wherever they are.

Jeremiah was to take a few large stones, such, nevertheless, as he could carry in his hand, and build with them, in the propylaea before the royal palace, something that would serve to represent the dais upon which the seat of kings was usually placed. By hiding them in the clay is meant plastering them over with mortar. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/43.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. stones&#8212;to be laid as the foundation beneath Nebuchadnezzar's throne (Jer 43:10).<p>clay&#8212;mortar.<p>brick-kiln&#8212;Bricks in that hot country are generally dried in the sun, not burned. The palace of Pharaoh was being built or repaired at this time; hence arose the mortar and brick-kiln at the entry. Of the same materials as that of which Pharaoh's house was built, the substructure of Nebuchadnezzar's throne should be constructed.

All that troubleth some is, that they fancy there should not be a <span class="ital">brick-kiln</span> so near the king’s palace; but possibly those learned men do not enough consider the difference of times and places. Great princes’ sons and daughters do not use in our age to keep sheep, which yet we know Jacob’s sons and Laban’s daughters did; the grandeur of princes was not so great but it might admit of as plain a thing as this. Others say the palaces of their princes were very vast, so that the brick-kiln might be at a distance from the entry into the dwelling-house, though it was at the entry of the place called by the name of the palace. Others think it might be a house used not for making, but polishing earthenware. But the greatest offensiveness of such kilns with us is from the smoke, of which they had none, drying their bricks in the sun. But it is a nicety not worth so many guesses. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/43.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Take great stones in thine hand,.... In both his hands, as big as he could carry: <p>and hide them in the clay in the brick kiln; there was much clay in Egypt, through the overflowing of the Nile, and particularly at this place Tahpanhes, which had its name of Pelusiae from hence; and here was a brick kiln; not a place where bricks were burnt, but where they were foraged; and so here was the clay of which they were made, and in which these stones were to be hid: <p>which is at the entry of Pharaoh's house in Tahpanhes; this brick kiln stood not directly at the entrance into the king's palace, but at the door of a wall of a park or garden, which belonged to the palace, from whence there was an open way to it; here the stones were to be laid. Since a brick kiln so near a king's palace seems not agreeable, Gussetius (h) thinks signifies a poplar walk, from  a poplar tree, whose shade is very grateful, <a href="/hosea/4-13.htm">Hosea 4:13</a>; to which the courtiers betook themselves at certain times, and walked in for pleasure; <p>in the sight of the men of Judah; not in the sight of the Egyptians, who would not understand the design of it, nor were they to be instructed by it; but in the sight of the Jews, who would at once imagine that something was intended, being used to such symbols, and would inquire the meaning of it; and which is explained in <a href="/jeremiah/43-10.htm">Jeremiah 43:10</a>. <p>(h) Ebr.

The MT. is questionable here. The words for “in the mortar” and “in the brickwork” resemble each other, the first occurring nowhere else. The LXX read simply “in the fore-court,” which is not justified by the Hebrew as we have it. Aq. Symm. Theod. have “in secret,” omitting one of the consonants of the Hebrew word for “in mortar,” and this probably gives us the true meaning, viz. <span class="ital">secretly, in the brickwork</span>. The incident (so Erbt and Co.) perhaps occurred at night. This is not inconsistent with the words “in the sight of the men of Judah,” for cp. <a href="/ezekiel/12-7.htm" title="And I did so as I was commanded: I brought forth my stuff by day, as stuff for captivity, and in the even I dig through the wall with my hand; I brought it forth in the twilight, and I bore it on my shoulder in their sight.">Ezekiel 12:7</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in the brickwork</span>] If we keep the text as it stands, the word, which elsewhere means a brick-mould, may here mean something quadrangular (see mg.). It is perhaps “the large oblong brick pavement close to the palace fort built by Psammetichus I (b.c. 664–610), which was excavated by Prof. Petrie at Tell Defneh in 1886.” Dr., p. 258, who adds references to Petrie and Maspero.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/43.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Take great stones,</span> etc. A strange symbolic act of Jeremiah's is here described. "We must not suppose, arguing from our Western and precise notions, that he would be at all necessarily interfered with. In fact, he would have a twofold security, as a prophet of God to those who acknowledged him as such, and in the opinion of others as insane, and, according to Eastern ideas, thus especially under Divine promptings in his acts" (Streane). He is directed to take great stones and embed them in the mortar (not "clay") in the brick pavement at the entry of the palace. When the events predicted came to pass, these stones would testify that Jeremiah had predicted them. The word rendered "brick pavement" is of doubtful meaning. In <a href="/nahum/3-14.htm">Nahum 3:14</a> it signifies "brick kiln." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/43.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The march of the people to Egypt. - When Jeremiah had thus ended all the words which the Lord had announced to him for the people, then came forward Azariah (probably an error for Jezaniah, see on <a href="/jeremiah/42-1.htm">Jeremiah 42:1</a>) the son of Hoshaiah, Johanan the son of Kareah, and the rest of the insolent men, and said to Jeremiah, "Thou dost utter falsehood; Jahveh our God hath not sent thee unto us, saying, Ye must not go to Egypt to sojourn there; <a href="/jeremiah/43-3.htm">Jeremiah 43:3</a>.

Azariah (or, more correctly, Jezaniah) occupies the last place in the enumeration of the captains, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-8.htm">Jeremiah 40:8</a>, and in <a href="/jeremiah/42-1.htm">Jeremiah 42:1</a> is also named after Johanan, who is the only one specially mentioned, in what follows, as the leader on the march. From this we may safely conclude that Jezaniah was the chief speaker and the leader of the opposition against the prophet. To avoid any reference to the promise they had made to obey the will of God, they declare that Jeremiah's prophecy is an untruth, which had been suggested to him, not by God, but by his attendant Baruch, with the view of delivering up the people to the Chaldeans. </body></html>
