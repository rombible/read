A waste shall the land become; but the wasting shall not be a thorough annihilation, not such a destruction as befell Sodom and Gomorrah. &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; , as in <a href="/nahum/1-8.htm">Nahum 1:8</a>., <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/10-23.htm">Isaiah 10:23</a>, and freq. This limitation is yet again in v. <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-10.htm">Jeremiah 5:10</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/5-18.htm">Jeremiah 5:18</a> made to apply to Jerusalem, as it has done already to the people at large. It is founded on the promise in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/26-44.htm">Leviticus 26:44</a>, that the Lord will punish Israel with the greatest severity for its stubborn apostasy from Him, but will not utterly destroy it, so as to break His covenant with it. Accordingly, all prophets declare that after the judgments of punishment, a remnant shall be left, from which a new holy race shall spring; cf. <a href="/amos/9-8.htm">Amos 9:8</a>; <a href="/isaiah/6-13.htm">Isaiah 6:13</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/11-11.htm">Isaiah 11:11</a>, <a href="/isaiah/11-16.htm">Isaiah 11:16</a>; <a href="/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20</a>., <a href="/micah/2-12.htm">Micah 2:12</a>; <a href="/micah/5-6.htm">Micah 5:6</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-13.htm">Zephaniah 3:13</a>, etc. "For this" refers to the first half of <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-27.htm">Jeremiah 4:27</a>, and is again resumed in the &#1506;&#1500; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; following: for this, because Jahveh hath purposed the desolation of the whole land. The earth mourns, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/4-3.htm">Hosea 4:3</a>, because her productive power is impaired by the ravaging of the land. The heaven blackens itself, i.e., shrouds itself in dark clouds (<a href="/1_kings/18-45.htm">1 Kings 18:45</a>), so as to mourn over the desolated earth. The vividness of the style permits "have decreed it" to be appended as asyndeton to "I have said it," for the sake of greater emphasis. God has not only pronounced the desolation of the land, but God's utterance in this is based upon a decree which God does not repent, and from which He will not turn back. The lxx have placed the &#1494;&#1502;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497; after &#1504;&#1495;&#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, and have thus obtained a neater arrangement of the clauses; but by this the force of expression in "I have said it, decreed it," is weakened. In <a href="/jeremiah/4-29.htm">Jeremiah 4:29</a> the desolation of the land is further portrayed, set forth in <a href="/jeremiah/4-30.htm">Jeremiah 4:30</a> as inevitable, and exhibited in its sad consequences in <a href="/jeremiah/4-31.htm">Jeremiah 4:31</a>. On the approach of the hostile army, all the inhabitants flee into inaccessible places from the clatter or noise of the horsemen and archers. He that casts the bow, the bowman; cf. <a href="/psalms/78-9.htm">Psalm 78:9</a>. &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512; means, in spite of the article, not the whole city, but every city, all cities, as may be gathered from the &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1503;, which points back to this. So frequently before the definite noun, especially when it is further defined by a relative clause, as e.g., <a href="/exodus/1-22.htm">Exodus 1:22</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/4-3.htm">Deuteronomy 4:3</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/3-17.htm">1 Samuel 3:17</a>; cf. Ew. 290, c. For the first  &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512;the lxx have &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b1; &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;, and accordingly J. D. Mich., Hitz., and Graf propose to amend to &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, so as to avoid "the clumsy repetition." But we cannot be ruled here by aesthetic principles of taste. Clearly the first "every city" means the populace of the cities, and so &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; is: they (i.e., the men) come, pouring forth. &#1506;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; is not here clouds, but, according to its etymology, to be dark, means the dark thickets or woods; cf. the Syr. &#768;a&#772;b, wood. &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1497;&#1501;, rocks, here clefts in the rocks, as is demanded by the &#1489;&#1468;. For this state of things, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/2-19.htm">Isaiah 2:19</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/2-21.htm">Isaiah 2:21</a>, and the accounts of <a href="/judges/6-2.htm">Judges 6:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-6.htm">1 Samuel 13:6</a>, where the Israelites hide themselves from the invading Midianites in caves, ravines, thorn-thickets, rocks, and natural fastnesses.</body></html>
