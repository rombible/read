The two adjectives “revolting” and “rebellious” (the negative and positive aspects of apostasy) are joined together, as in <a href="/deuteronomy/21-18.htm" title="If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, which will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and that, when they have chastened him, will not listen to them:">Deuteronomy 21:18</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/21-20.htm" title="And they shall say to the elders of his city, This our son is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton, and a drunkard.">Deuteronomy 21:20</a>.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:19-31 Unhumbled hearts are ready to charge God with being unjust in their afflictions. But they may read their sin in their punishment. If men will inquire wherefore the Lord doeth hard things unto them, let them think of their sins. The restless waves obeyed the Divine decree, that they should not pass the sandy shores, which were as much a restraint as lofty mountains; but they burst all restraints of God's law, and were wholly gone into wickedness. Neither did they consider their interest. While the Lord, year after year, reserves to us the appointed weeks of harvest, men live on his bounty; yet they transgress against him. Sin deprives us of God's blessings; it makes the heaven as brass, and the earth as iron. Certainly the things of this world are not the best things; and we are not to think, that, because evil men prosper, God allows their practices. Though sentence against evil works is not executed speedily, it will be executed. Shall I not visit for these things? This speaks the certainty and the necessity of God's judgments. Let those who walk in bad ways consider that an end will come, and there will be bitterness in the latter end.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The heart, or will of the Jews was first "revolting," literally a will that "drew back" from God, because it disliked His service; and secondly it was "rebellious," a will that actively resisted Him.

We need not wait to refute Hitz.'s absurd remark, that the author imagined the enemy, the assumed Scythians, to be cannibals. In the second half of the verse the words, "the fenced cities wherein thou trustest,"are a reminiscence of <a href="/deuteronomy/28-52.htm">Deuteronomy 28:52</a>; and hence we may see, that while our prophet is describing the enemy in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-15.htm">Jeremiah 5:15-18</a>, Moses' threatening, <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-49.htm">Deuteronomy 28:49-52</a>, was in his mind. &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1513;&#1473;, break in pieces, as in <a href="/malachi/1-4.htm">Malachi 1:4</a>.
