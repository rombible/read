As the word is generally used in Jeremiah of the false prophets, Gi. takes it in that sense here, but he is obliged for that purpose to transpose <span class="ital"><a href="/context/jeremiah/5-13.htm" title="And the prophets shall become wind, and the word is not in them: thus shall it be done to them....">Jeremiah 5:13-14</a></span> and attribute the words to God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">shall it</span>] rather, <span class="ital">may it</span>. “The Lord do so to you also,” is the people’s imprecation on the prophets who rebuke them. Codex A (Alexandrian) of LXX omits the words, but this may have been done by the translators themselves or by a copyist, as thinking it too much to the national discredit that a formula of cursing should have been used towards the prophets. The metre of the <span class="ital">v</span>. is, however, the better for their absence, and, as Co. says, they may well have been added as a gloss, under the erroneous impression that the reference was to <span class="ital">false</span> prophets. Du., for metrical reasons, transfers the clause to <span class="ital"><a href="/jeremiah/5-14.htm" title="Why thus said the LORD God of hosts, Because you speak this word, behold, I will make my words in your mouth fire, and this people wood, and it shall devour them.">Jeremiah 5:14</a></span>, and places it in Jehovah’s mouth, inserting it after “this word.”<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the prophets</span>, etc. A continuation of the speech of the unbelieving Jews. <span class="cmt_word">The word is not in them</span>. The Authorized Version gives a good meaning, but it involves an interference with the points. The pointed text must be rendered, <span class="accented">he who speaketh</span> (<span class="accented">through the prophets</span>, viz. Jehovah) <span class="accented">is not in them</span>. Thus the Jews hurl against prophets like Jeremiah the very charge which Jeremiah himself brings against the "false prophets" in <a href="/jeremiah/23-25.htm">Jeremiah 23:25-32</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Thus shall it be done</span>; rather, so <span class="accented">be it done</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. may the sword and famine, with which they threaten us, fall upon them. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>This verse is neither a threatening of future punishments, nor is to be taken figuratively (lion, bear, leopard, as figures for dreadful enemies). The change from the perf. &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1501; to the imperf. &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1491;&#1501; and &#1497;&#1496;&#1468;&#1512;&#1507; tells against the future construction, showing as it does that the verbs are used aoristically of chastisements which have partly already taken place, which may be partly yet to come. And the figurative explanation of the beasts of prey by hostile peoples - found so early as the Chald. - is not in the least called for by the text; nor is it easy to reconcile it with the specification of various kinds of wild beasts. The words are a case of the threatening of the law in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/26-22.htm">Leviticus 26:22</a>, that God will chasten the transgressors of His law by sending beasts of prey which shall rob them of their children. Cf. with the promise, that if they keep His commandments, He will destroy the wild beasts out of the land. Cf. also the fact given in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/17-25.htm">2 Kings 17:25</a>, that God sent lions amongst the heathen colonists who had been transplanted into the depopulated kingdom of the ten tribes, lions which slew some of them, because they served not Jahveh. The true conception of the words is confirmed by <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-15.htm">Ezekiel 14:15</a>, when in like manner the sending of evil (ravening) beasts is mentioned as an example of God's punishments. &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;, smite, is a standing expression for the lion's way of striking down his prey with his paws; cf. <a href="/1_kings/20-36.htm">1 Kings 20:36</a>. &#1494;&#1488;&#1489; &#1506;&#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; is not wolf of the evening, as Chald. Syr., Hitz. explain it, following <a href="/habakkuk/1-8.htm">Habakkuk 1:8</a> and <a href="/zephaniah/3-3.htm">Zephaniah 3:3</a>; for &#1506;&#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; is not the plural of &#1506;&#1512;&#1489;, but of &#1506;&#1512;&#1489;&#1492;, steppe: the wolf that lives in the steppe, and thence makes its raids on inhabited spots. The reference of the words to place is suggested plainly by the parallel, the lion out of the wood. The leopard (panther) watches, i.e., lies lurking in wait against their cities, to tear those that come out. The panther is wont to lie in wait for his prey, and to spring suddenly out on it; cf. <a href="/hosea/13-7.htm">Hosea 13:7</a>. With "because many are thy transgressions," cf. <a href="/jeremiah/30-14.htm">Jeremiah 30:14</a>.<p>Since these chastisements have profited nothing God cannot pardon the people. This is the meaning of the question in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-7.htm">Jeremiah 5:7</a>, &#1488;&#1497; &#1500;&#1494;&#1488;&#1514;, wherefore should I then pardon? not, should I then pardon for this? for &#1488;&#1497; by itself does not stand for &#1492; interrog., but is set before the pronom. demonstr. to give it the force of an interrogative adjective; cf. Ew. 326, a. The Cheth. &#1488;&#1505;&#1500;&#1493;&#1495;est obsoletum adeoque genuinum (Ros.); the Keri substitutes the usual form. To justify the question with a negative answer implied, the people's fall into idolatry is again set up before it in strong colours. Thy sons (the sons of the daughter of Zion, i.e., of the national congregation, and so the individual members of the nation; cf. <a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>) have forsaken me, and swear by them that are not gods, i.e., the idols; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/2-11.htm">Jeremiah 2:11</a>. For &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1506;  &#1488;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501;, I caused them to swear, the old translators have &#1488;&#1513;&#1474;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1506; , I filled them to the full, and so it is read in many codd. and edd. This reading is preferred by most of the ancient commentators, and they appeal for a parallel to <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-28.htm">Jeremiah 5:28</a>, and <a href="/deuteronomy/32-15.htm">Deuteronomy 32:15</a> ("when Jeshurun waxed fat, he kicked"), <a href="/hosea/13-6.htm">Hosea 13:6</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-25.htm">Nehemiah 9:25</a>, etc., where apostasy from God is chidden as a consequence of superfluity of earthly goods. So Luther: "and now that I have filled them full, they committed adultery." Now possibly it is just the recollection of the passages cited that has suggested the reading &#1488;&#1513;&#1474;&#1489;&#1497;&#1506;. The apodosis, they committed adultery, forms no antithesis to filling full. Adultery presupposes a marriage vow, or troth plighted by an oath. God caused Israel to swear fidelity when He made the covenant with it at Sinai, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/24.htm">Exodus 24</a>. This oath Israel repeated at each renewal of the covenant, and last under Josiah: <a href="/2_kings/23-3.htm">2 Kings 23:3</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/34-31.htm">2 Chronicles 34:31</a>. Hence we must not wholly restrict the searing to the conclusion of the covenant at Sinai, nor wholly to the renewal of it under Josiah. We must refer it to both acts, or rather to the solemnity at Sinai, together with all solemn renewals of it in after times; while at the same time the reference to the renewal under Josiah, this being still fresh in memory, may have been the foremost. We must not confine the reference of &#1497;&#1504;&#1488;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468; to spiritual adultery ( equals  a fall away from Jahveh into idolatry); the context, especially the next clause, and yet more unmistakeably <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-8.htm">Jeremiah 5:8</a>, refers to carnal uncleanness. This too was a breach of the covenant, since in taking it the people bound itself not only to be faithful to God, but to keep and follow all the laws of His covenant. That the words, crowd into the house of the harlot, i.e., go thither in crowds, are to be taken of carnal uncleanness, may be gathered from <a href="/jeremiah/5-8.htm">Jeremiah 5:8</a>: each neighs after the wife of his neighbour. Fornication is denounced as a desecration of the name of the Lord in <a href="/amos/2-7.htm">Amos 2:7</a>. The first clause of <a href="/jeremiah/5-8.htm">Jeremiah 5:8</a> suggests a comparison: well-fed horses are they, i.e., they resemble such. On the lechery of horses, see on <a href="/ezekiel/23-20.htm">Ezekiel 23:20</a>. The Cheth. &#1502;&#1493;&#1494;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; is partic. Hoph. of &#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;, in Aram. feed, fatten, here most suitable. The Keri &#1502;&#1497;&#1494;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; would be the partic. Pu. from &#1497;&#1494;&#1503;, the meaning of which is doubtful, given arbitrarily by Kimchi and others as armati sc. membro genitali. &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, too, is derived from &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498;, and given by Jerome sensu obscaeno: trahentes sc. genitalia; but &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; cannot come from &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498;, &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; being the only possible form in that case. Nor does trahentes, "draught-horses" (Hitz.), give a sense at all in point for the comparison. A better view is that of those who follow Simonis, in holding it to be partic. Hiph. of &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1492;, in Aethiop. oberravit, vagatus est. The participle is not to be joined with "horses" as a second qualifying word, but to be taken with &#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468;, the periphrastic form being chosen to indicate the enduring chronic character of the roaming.</body></html>
