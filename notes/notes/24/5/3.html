That is, thou hast no regard to such deceitful men, such hypocritical worshippers and formal professors, but to true and upright men: God looks not at outward appearances, but to the heart; he can see through all masks and vizards, there is no deceiving of him; he desires truth in the inward parts, and his eyes are on that; he has respect to men that have the truth of grace, the root of the matter in them, oil in their vessels, together with the lamps of an outward profession: his eyes are on such as have a true inward sense of sin, a genuine repentance for it, and that make a sincere, hearty, and ingenuous confession of it; to this man he looks, that is poor, and of a contrite spirit; he is nigh to such, and dwells with them; when he has no regard to the sad countenances and disfigured faces of Pharisees; to the tears of a profane Esau, or to the external humiliations and concessions of a wicked Pharaoh: his eyes are upon the internal graces of his own Spirit; to love, that is in deed and in truth; to hope, that is without dissimulation, and to faith unfeigned: and so the Septuagint, Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and Arabic versions render it, "thine eyes are unto faith"; or, respect faith (p); the faith of Christians, as Jerom interprets it. Faith is a grace well pleasing to God, and everything that is done in faith is so, and nothing else; it is a grace that gives glory to God, and on which he has put much honour, in making it the receiver of all the blessings of grace, and connecting salvation with it; he has so great a regard for it, that whatever it asks it has of him. In short, the sense is, that the eyes of the Lord, of his love, favour, good will, and delight, are upon such whose hearts are upright towards him; who draw nigh to him in truth, worship him in spirit and in truth, and are hearty to his cause and interest, and faithful to his word and ordinances; who are lovers of truth; of Christ, who is the truth itself; and of his Gospel, the word of truth, and the doctrines of it; see <a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>. <p>Thou hast stricken them, but they have not grieved; that is, the Lord had courted and chastised them with afflictive providences; he had brought his judgments upon them, and had smitten them with the sword, or famine, or pestilence, or some such sore calamity, and yet it had not brought them to a sense of their sin, and to a godly sorrow for it: <p>thou hast consumed them, but they have refused to receive correction; God had by his judgments consumed or swept away many of them, yet the rest did not take warning thereby, but went on in their sins; or they were brought near to consumption, as Kimchi interprets it; nevertheless remained obstinate and incorrigible, refused to receive any correction or instruction by such providences: <p>they have made their faces harder than a rock; becoming more impudent in sinning, not blushing at, or being ashamed for it, and unmoved by judgments and chastising providence: <p>they have refused to return; to the Lord, and to his worship, from which they revolted; or by repentance, and unto faith and truth, from which they had swerved. <p>(p)   "oculi tui respiciunt fidem", V.

A waste shall the land become; but the wasting shall not be a thorough annihilation, not such a destruction as befell Sodom and Gomorrah. &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; , as in <a href="/nahum/1-8.htm">Nahum 1:8</a>., <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/10-23.htm">Isaiah 10:23</a>, and freq. This limitation is yet again in v. <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-10.htm">Jeremiah 5:10</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/5-18.htm">Jeremiah 5:18</a> made to apply to Jerusalem, as it has done already to the people at large. It is founded on the promise in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/26-44.htm">Leviticus 26:44</a>, that the Lord will punish Israel with the greatest severity for its stubborn apostasy from Him, but will not utterly destroy it, so as to break His covenant with it. Accordingly, all prophets declare that after the judgments of punishment, a remnant shall be left, from which a new holy race shall spring; cf. <a href="/amos/9-8.htm">Amos 9:8</a>; <a href="/isaiah/6-13.htm">Isaiah 6:13</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/11-11.htm">Isaiah 11:11</a>, <a href="/isaiah/11-16.htm">Isaiah 11:16</a>; <a href="/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20</a>., <a href="/micah/2-12.htm">Micah 2:12</a>; <a href="/micah/5-6.htm">Micah 5:6</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-13.htm">Zephaniah 3:13</a>, etc. "For this" refers to the first half of <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-27.htm">Jeremiah 4:27</a>, and is again resumed in the &#1506;&#1500; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; following: for this, because Jahveh hath purposed the desolation of the whole land. The earth mourns, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/4-3.htm">Hosea 4:3</a>, because her productive power is impaired by the ravaging of the land. The heaven blackens itself, i.e., shrouds itself in dark clouds (<a href="/1_kings/18-45.htm">1 Kings 18:45</a>), so as to mourn over the desolated earth. The vividness of the style permits "have decreed it" to be appended as asyndeton to "I have said it," for the sake of greater emphasis. God has not only pronounced the desolation of the land, but God's utterance in this is based upon a decree which God does not repent, and from which He will not turn back. The lxx have placed the &#1494;&#1502;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497; after &#1504;&#1495;&#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, and have thus obtained a neater arrangement of the clauses; but by this the force of expression in "I have said it, decreed it," is weakened. In <a href="/jeremiah/4-29.htm">Jeremiah 4:29</a> the desolation of the land is further portrayed, set forth in <a href="/jeremiah/4-30.htm">Jeremiah 4:30</a> as inevitable, and exhibited in its sad consequences in <a href="/jeremiah/4-31.htm">Jeremiah 4:31</a>. On the approach of the hostile army, all the inhabitants flee into inaccessible places from the clatter or noise of the horsemen and archers. He that casts the bow, the bowman; cf. <a href="/psalms/78-9.htm">Psalm 78:9</a>. &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512; means, in spite of the article, not the whole city, but every city, all cities, as may be gathered from the &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1503;, which points back to this. So frequently before the definite noun, especially when it is further defined by a relative clause, as e.g., <a href="/exodus/1-22.htm">Exodus 1:22</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/4-3.htm">Deuteronomy 4:3</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/3-17.htm">1 Samuel 3:17</a>; cf. Ew. 290, c. For the first  &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512;the lxx have &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b1; &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;, and accordingly J. D. Mich., Hitz., and Graf propose to amend to &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, so as to avoid "the clumsy repetition." But we cannot be ruled here by aesthetic principles of taste. Clearly the first "every city" means the populace of the cities, and so &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; is: they (i.e., the men) come, pouring forth. &#1506;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; is not here clouds, but, according to its etymology, to be dark, means the dark thickets or woods; cf. the Syr. &#768;a&#772;b, wood. &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1497;&#1501;, rocks, here clefts in the rocks, as is demanded by the &#1489;&#1468;. For this state of things, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/2-19.htm">Isaiah 2:19</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/2-21.htm">Isaiah 2:21</a>, and the accounts of <a href="/judges/6-2.htm">Judges 6:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-6.htm">1 Samuel 13:6</a>, where the Israelites hide themselves from the invading Midianites in caves, ravines, thorn-thickets, rocks, and natural fastnesses.</body></html>
