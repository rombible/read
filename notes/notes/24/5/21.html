But they may read their sin in their punishment. If men will inquire wherefore the Lord doeth hard things unto them, let them think of their sins. The restless waves obeyed the Divine decree, that they should not pass the sandy shores, which were as much a restraint as lofty mountains; but they burst all restraints of God's law, and were wholly gone into wickedness. Neither did they consider their interest. While the Lord, year after year, reserves to us the appointed weeks of harvest, men live on his bounty; yet they transgress against him. Sin deprives us of God's blessings; it makes the heaven as brass, and the earth as iron. Certainly the things of this world are not the best things; and we are not to think, that, because evil men prosper, God allows their practices. Though sentence against evil works is not executed speedily, it will be executed. Shall I not visit for these things? This speaks the certainty and the necessity of God's judgments. Let those who walk in bad ways consider that an end will come, and there will be bitterness in the latter end.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Against the God<p>(1) of Creation <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-22.htm">Jeremiah 5:22</a>, and<p>(2) of Providence <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-24.htm">Jeremiah 5:24</a>,<p>They sin, not merely by apostasy, but by a general immorality extending to all classes <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-25.htm">Jeremiah 5:25-28</a>.

This seems at first sight inconsistent with ver. 23, where the people is described as having indeed a "heart," but one hostile to Jehovah. The explanation is that a course of deliberate sin perverts a man's moral perceptions. The prophet first of all states the result, and then the cause.

Because it, despising the threatening of punishment, says: Misfortune shall not light upon us, the Lord will make the word in the mouth of Jeremiah a fire, and the people wood, that the fire may consume it. On this figure, cf. <a href="/isaiah/1-31.htm">Isaiah 1:31</a>; <a href="/isaiah/10-17.htm">Isaiah 10:17</a>. <a href="/jeremiah/5-15.htm">Jeremiah 5:15</a>. explain this, and announce the inroad of a dreadful enemy that is to lay waste the land and consume the people. "A people from far," as in <a href="/jeremiah/4-16.htm">Jeremiah 4:16</a>. Judah is called "house of Israel," not so much because it is what remains of Israel, but because, after the captivity of the ten tribes, Judah regarded itself as the only true Israel or people of God.

A people speaking a language unfamiliar to the Jews, to comprehend whom is impossible, i.e., barbarous; cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/28-49.htm">Deuteronomy 28:49</a>. Further (<a href="/jeremiah/5-16.htm">Jeremiah 5:16</a>), it is a race of very heroes, fully furnished with deadly weapons. J. D. Mich. took objection to the figure, "its quiver is as an open grave;" but his conjecture &#1513;&#1474;&#1508;&#1514;&#1493; put nothing better in place of it. The link of comparison is this: as an open grave is filled with dead men, so the quiver of this enemy is filled with deadly missiles. </body></html>
