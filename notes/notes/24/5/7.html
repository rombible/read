There are God's poor, who, notwithstanding poverty, know the way of the Lord, walk in it, and do their duty; but these were willingly ignorant, and their ignorance would not be their excuse.

Because of their manifold transgressions, and multiplied backslidings; or "wherefore, or for what, shall I pardon thee?" (r) as the Targum; can any reason be given why I should? what goodness is there in thee, or done by thee, that I should do this unto thee? The particle  according to Kimchi, is a word of exclamation; and, according to Jarchi, of admiration; and may be rendered, "oh! for this shall I pardon?" how can it be? R. Menachem; in Jarchi, takes it to be the same with  "not"; and to be rendered, not for this will I pardon; and so is an affirmation, and fixed resolution not to pardon, and that for the following reasons: <p>thy children have forsaken me; my worship, as the Targum interprets it; that is, the children of Jerusalem, the inhabitants of it, the common people, as distinguished from their fathers, the civil and ecclesiastical rulers; see <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/23-37.htm">Matthew 23:37</a>, though not to the exclusion of them; for they were guilty of the same sin in forsaking the word, worship, and ordinances of God: <p>and sworn by them that are no gods; by the name of idols, as the Targum; or, "by those things which are not god", as Noldius (s) renders the words; who rightly observes, that there were other things besides idols that they swore by, as the heaven and earth, temple, altar, &amp;c. with which the Arabic version agrees; when an oath ought only to be taken in the name of the living God; or, "swore without God"; without making mention of the name of the true God: <p>when I had fed them to the full; with the good things of life; gave them all things richly to enjoy; the best provisions, and fulness of them; so that they had all that heart could wish for. There is in the Hebrew text a beautiful play on words (t), between the word used for swearing in the former clause, and this for feeding here: <p>they then committed adultery; either idolatry, which is spiritual adultery; or adultery literally taken; as it seems from the following verse. This is the consequence of their being fullly fed; and that is an aggravation of this their sin against God and their neighbour; see <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-13.htm">Deuteronomy 32:13</a>, <p>and assembled themselves by troops in the harlots' houses; either in the temples of idols, or in the stews or brothel houses, where harlots prostituted themselves; their going thither in troops, or in great numbers, shows both how universal and how public this sin was, and how impudent and barefaced they were in the commission of it. <p>(r)    "ad quid, vel ob quid, vel quare parcam tibi?"

But the reading of the received Hebrew text, though somewhat more difficult, is yet perfectly capable of explanation; and, slight as the difference is in the reading adopted by Ewald (it involves a mere shade of pronunciation), it is not to be preferred to the received reading.

The "adultery" may be taken both in a literal and in a figurative sense, and so also the "harlots' houses" in the next clause. It is also well worthy of consideration whether the prophet may not be referring to certain matrimonial customs handed down from remote antiquity and arising from the ancient system of kinship through women (comp. <a href="/ezekiel/22-11.htm">Ezekiel 22:11</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>By reason of the universal godlessness and moral corruption the Lord cannot pardon. - <a href="/jeremiah/5-1.htm">Jeremiah 5:1</a>. "Range through the streets of Jerusalem, and see now, and know, and seek upon her thoroughfares, if ye find any, if any doth judgment, seeketh after faithfulness, and I will pardon her. <a href="/jeremiah/5-2.htm">Jeremiah 5:2</a>.

I will get me then to the great, and will speak with them, for they know the way of Jahveh, the judgment of their God; yet together have they broken the yoke, burst the bonds. <a href="/jeremiah/5-6.htm">Jeremiah 5:6</a>. Therefore a lion out of the wood smiteth them, a wolf of the deserts spoileth them, a leopard lieth in wait against their cities: every one that goeth out thence is torn in pieces; because many are their transgressions, many their backslidings. <a href="/jeremiah/5-7.htm">Jeremiah 5:7</a>. Wherefore should I pardon thee? thy sons have forsaken me, and sworn by them that are no gods. I caused them to sear, but they committed adultery, and crowd into the house of the harlot. <a href="/jeremiah/5-8.htm">Jeremiah 5:8</a>. Like well-fed horses, they are roaming about; each neigheth after the other's wife. <a href="/jeremiah/5-9.htm">Jeremiah 5:9</a>. Shall I not punish this? saith Jahveh; or shall not my soul be avenged on such a people as this?"<p>The thought of <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-1.htm">Jeremiah 5:1</a>, that in Jerusalem there is not to be found one solitary soul who concerns himself about uprightness and sincerity, does not, though rhetorically expressed, contain any rhetorical hyperbole or exaggeration such as may have arisen from the prophet's righteous indignation, or have been inferred from the severity of the expected judgment (Hitz.); it gives but the simple truth, as is seen when we consider that it is not Jeremiah who speaks according to the best of his judgment, but God, the searcher of hearts. Before the all-seeing eye of God no man is pure and good. They are all gone astray, and there is none that doeth good, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/14-2.htm">Psalm 14:2-3</a>. And if anywhere the fear of God is the ruling principle, yet when the look falls on the mighty hosts of the wicked, even the human eye loses sight of the small company of the godly, since they are in no case to exert an influence on the moral standing of the whole mass. "If ye find any" is defined by, "if there is a worker of right;" and the doing of right or judgment is made more complete by "that seeketh faithfulness," the doing of right or judgment is made more complete by "that seeketh faithfulness," the doing being given as the outcome of the disposition. &#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; is not truth (&#1488;&#1502;&#1514;), but sincerity and good faith. On this state of affairs, cf. <a href="/hosea/4-1.htm">Hosea 4:1</a>; <a href="/micah/7-2.htm">Micah 7:2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/64-5.htm">Isaiah 64:5</a>. The pledge that God would pardon Jerusalem if He found but one righteous man in it, recalls Abraham's dealing with God on behalf of Sodom, <a href="/genesis/18-23.htm">Genesis 18:23</a>. In support of what has been said, it is added in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-2.htm">Jeremiah 5:2</a>, that they even abuse God's name for lying purposes; cf. <a href="/leviticus/19-12.htm">Leviticus 19:12</a>. Making oath by the life of Jahveh is not looked on here as a confession of faith in the Lord, giving thus as the sense, that even their worship of God was but the work of the lips, not of the heart (Ros.); but the solemn appeal to the living God for the purpose of setting the impress of truth on the face of a life, is brought forward as evidence that there is none that strives after sincerity. the antithesis forced in here by Hitz. and Graf is foreign to text and context both, viz., that between swearing by Jahveh and by the false gods, or any other indifferent name. The emphasis lies on swearing &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1512;, as opposed to swearing in the way demanded by God, &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1514; &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496; &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1492;, <a href="/jeremiah/4-2.htm">Jeremiah 4:2</a>. &#1500;&#1499;&#1503;, therein, i.e., yet even in this, or nevertheless.</body></html>
