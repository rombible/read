How could Israel pride itself in that which it had in common with some of the nations that it most abhorred. The later Idumaeans seem to have abandoned the practice till it was forced upon them by John Hyrcanus (Joseph., <span class= "ital">Ant. xi.</span> 9, 15:7).

The “wilderness” is the Arabian desert to the east of Palestine, inhabited by the Ishmaelites and other kindred races. As if to complete the contempt which he pours on circumcision, the prophet speaks of the barbarous people, whose customs were specially forbidden to Israel (<a href="/leviticus/19-27.htm" title="You shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shall you mar the corners of your beard.">Leviticus 19:27</a>), as in this respect standing on the same level with Israel. If circumcision by itself were enough to secure immunity from judgment, they too, as practising a rite analogous though not identical, might claim it.<p><span class= "bld">All these nations are uncircumcised.</span>—The English Version makes the prophet say exactly the opposite of what he really said. <span class= "ital">All the heathen </span>(not “these nations”) are in God’s sight as uncircumcised, whether they practise the outward rite or not—and the state of Israel was not a whit better than theirs, for she too was uncircumcised in heart.

Jarchi's note is, <p>"them that are cut off in a corner of the wilderness;'' <p>that live by themselves, and have no communication with other people; were at the greatest distance, and secure; dwelt alone, and had neither gates nor bars, as is said of the same people, <a href="/jeremiah/49-31.htm">Jeremiah 49:31</a>.

Herodotus tells us, speaking of the Arabs, "Their practice is to cut the hair in a ring, away from the temples" (3:8); and among the representatives of various nations, colored figures of whom are given in the tomb of Rameses III., we find some with a square place shaved just above the temples. The hair below this shaven place was allowed to grow long, and then plaited into a leek. It is to such customs that Jeremiah alludes here and in <a href="/jeremiah/25-23.htm">Jeremiah 25:23</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/49-32.htm">Jeremiah 49:32</a>. A prohibition is directed against them in the Levitical Law (<a href="/leviticus/19-27.htm">Leviticus 19:27</a>; <a href="/leviticus/21-5.htm">Leviticus 21:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For all these nations are uncircumcised</span>; rather, <span class="accented">all the nations</span>, etc. Another obscure expression. Does it mean (taken together with the following clause), "The Gentile peoples are uncircumcised in the flesh, and the people of Israel is equally so in heart?" But this does not agree with facts (see above, on Ver. 25). It is safer, therefore, to assume that "uncircumcised" is equivalent to "circumcised in uncircumcision" (Ver. 25). The next clause will then simply give the most conspicuous instance of this unspiritual obedience to a mere form. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Death comes in through (in at) the windows, not because the doors are to be thought of as barricaded (Hitz.), but as a thief in the night, i.e., suddenly, in an unexpected way. Perhaps Jeremiah was here thinking of <a href="/joel/2-9.htm">Joel 2:9</a>. And comes into the palaces, i.e., spares no house, but carries off high and low. The second clause is not to be very closely joined with the first, thus: Death comes into the houses and palaces, to sweep the children from off the streets; this would be self-contradictory. We must rather repeat "comes" from the first clause: He comes to sweep off the streets the child at play. That is: In the houses and palaces, as upon the streets and highways, he will seize his prey.</body></html>
