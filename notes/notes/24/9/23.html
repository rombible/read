Now there comes the conclusion of the whole matter—that the one way of salvation is to renounce all reliance on the wisdom, greatness, wealth of the world, and to glory only in knowing Jehovah. The “wise man” is, as before in <a href="/jeremiah/8-9.htm" title="The wise men are ashamed, they are dismayed and taken: see, they have rejected the word of the LORD; and what wisdom is in them?">Jeremiah 8:9</a>, and <a href="/jeremiah/9-12.htm" title="Who is the wise man, that may understand this? and who is he to whom the mouth of the LORD has spoken, that he may declare it, for what the land perishes and is burned up like a wilderness, that none passes through?">Jeremiah 9:12</a>, the scribe, or recognised teacher of the people<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/9.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/jeremiah/9-23.htm" title="Thus said the LORD, Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his might, let not the rich man glory in his riches:...">Jeremiah 9:23-24</a>. </span><span class="ital">Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom </span>— Let not men value themselves on account of their wisdom, strength, or riches, which are things in themselves of a very uncertain continuance, and such calamities are coming, (see <a href="/context/jeremiah/9-25.htm" title="Behold, the days come, said the LORD, that I will punish all them which are circumcised with the uncircumcised;...">Jeremiah 9:25-26</a>,) in which they will stand the owners of them in very little stead. The only true, valuable endowment is the knowledge of God, not as he is in himself, which is too high an attainment for poor mortals to pretend to, but with respect to his dealings with men; to have a serious sense of his mercies to the penitent, of his judgments to the obstinate, and of his truth and integrity, in making good his promises and threatenings to both. It is in the exercise of these attributes God chiefly delights; and it is by these he desires to make himself known to the world; and he that forms a just and lively apprehension of God, chiefly with regard to these his perfections, will always demean himself suitably toward him. <span class="ital">Judgment </span>and <span class="ital">righteousness </span>are often equivalent terms, but here the former seems to denote God’s severity against the wicked, and the latter his truth, justice, or holiness.

Not in his natural wisdom, or knowledge of natural things: this is often but an appearance of wisdom, and is science falsely so called; and whatever is real of this kind is of God; and the best falls short of leading men to a true and saving knowledge of God; the foolishness of God is wiser than it; and it is made foolish, destroyed, and brought to nought by him: nor in evangelical wisdom and knowledge; not in that which is less common, or what fits men for public usefulness, as ministerial gifts; for such are received from above; are more for the use of others than a man's self; there is something better than these, which a man may not have, and yet have these, which is grace; those may fade, or be taken away; and a man have them, and be lost eternally: nor in that which is more general, speculative knowledge of Gospel truths; for if it is attended with conceit, it is little or nothing that a man knows; if he is proud of it, his knowledge is not sanctified; and it is no other than what the devils themselves have: nor in that which is more special; wisdom in the inward part, or a spiritual and saving knowledge of God in Christ; this a man has wholly of free grace, and should give the praise and glory of it to God, and not attribute it to himself: <p>neither let the mighty man glory in his might; not in his natural might or strength; this is of God, and is greater in some of the brutes than in men; and is what God can take away, and does often weaken it in the way by diseases, and at last destroys it by death; nor in moral strength, or in the power of free will; which is very weak and insufficient to do anything that is spiritually good: nor even in spiritual strength; this is from Christ; it is only through him strengthening his people that they do what they do; and all supplies and increase of it are from him; and therefore no room for glorying: <p>let not the rich man glory in his riches; these come of the hand of God, and are what he can take away at pleasure; they are very uncertain and precarious things; there is a better and more enduring substance; these cannot profit in a day of wrath, nor deliver from death, corporeal, spiritual, or eternal. And the intention of the words here is to show, that neither the wise man with all his art and cunning, nor the mighty man by his strength, nor the rich man through his riches, could save themselves from the destruction before prophesied of. The Targum paraphrases them thus, <p>"thus saith the Lord, let not Solomon the son of David the wise man praise (or please himself) in his wisdom; nor let Samson the son of Manoah the mighty man please himself in his might; nor let Ahab the son of Omri the rich man please himself in his riches.'' <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Thus saith the LORD, Let not the <span class="cverse3">{r}</span> wise <i>man</i> glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty <i>man</i> glory in his might, let not the rich <i>man</i> glory in his riches:</span><p>(r) As none can save himself by his own labour, or any worldly means, he shows that it is vain to put our trust in it, but that we trust in the Lord, and rejoice in him, who only can deliver.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/9.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">23–26</span>. See summary introducing the section. Piety alone is the source of true glory. Circumcision, as the mere external mark of the covenant, of itself brings no man, Jew or otherwise, favour with God. 23, 24, and 25, 26 form two detached utterances, which have no relation to this context, and we cannot now say where they should be placed. The former is quite in agreement with other sayings of the prophet (<a href="/jeremiah/8-9.htm" title="The wise men are ashamed, they are dismayed and taken: see, they have rejected the word of the LORD; and what wisdom is in them?">Jeremiah 8:9</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/17-5.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; Cursed be the man that trusts in man, and makes flesh his arm, and whose heart departs from the LORD.">Jeremiah 17:5</a> f., <a href="/jeremiah/22-13.htm" title="Woe to him that builds his house by unrighteousness, and his chambers by wrong; that uses his neighbor's service without wages, and gives him not for his work;">Jeremiah 22:13</a> ff.).

There the prophet looks forward to a complete desolation resulting from the Chaldean invasion, and yet declares that he can even exult in his God. So here.

Speak: Thus runs the saying of Jahve: And the carcases of men shall fall as dung upon the field, and as a sheaf behind the shearer, which none gathereth."<p>In this strophe we have a further account of the execution of the judgment, and a poetical description of the vast harvest death is to have in Zion. The citizens of Zion are called upon to give heed to the state of affairs now in prospect, i.e., the judgment preparing, and are to assemble mourning women that they may strike up a dirge for the dead. &#1492;&#1514;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1504;&#1503;, to be attentive, give heed to a thing; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/2-10.htm">Jeremiah 2:10</a>. Women cunning in song are to come with speed (&#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492;&#1512;&#1504;&#1492; takes the place of an adverb). The form &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492; (<a href="/psalms/45-16.htm">Psalm 45:16</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/10-7.htm">1 Samuel 10:7</a>) alternates with &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488;&#1504;&#1492;&#1468;, the usual form in this verb, e.g., <a href="/genesis/30-38.htm">Genesis 30:38</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/3-16.htm">1 Kings 3:16</a>, etc., in order to produce an alternating form of expression . "For us" Ng. understands of those who call the mourning women, and in it he finds "something unusual," because ordinarily mourners are summoned to lament for those already dead, i.e., others than those who summon them. "But here they are to raise their laments for the very persons who summon them, and for the death of these same, which has yet to happen." There is a misunderstanding at the bottom of this remark. The "for us" is not said of the callers; for these are addressed in the second person. If Ng.'s view were right, it must be "for you," not "for us." True, the lxx has &#x3b5;&#x3c6; &#787; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c2;; but Hitz. has rejected this reading as a simplification and weakening expression, and as disturbing the plan. "For us" is used by the people taken collectively, the nation as such, which is to be so sorely afflicted and chastised by death that it is time for the mourning women to raise their dirge, that so the nation may give vent to its grief in tears. We must also take into account, that even although the lamentations were for the dead, they yet chiefly concerned the living, who had been deeply afflicted by the loss of beloved relations; it would not be the dead merely that were mourned for, but the living too, because of their loss. It is this reference that stands here in the foreground, since the purpose of the chanting of dirges is that our eyes may flow with tears, etc. Zion will lament the slain of her people (<a href="/jeremiah/8-22.htm">Jeremiah 8:22</a>), and so the mourning women are to strike up dirges. &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1504;&#1492; for &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488;&#1504;&#1492;, as in <a href="/ruth/1-14.htm">Ruth 1:14</a>; cf. Ew. 198, b. On the use of &#1497;&#1512;&#1491; and &#1504;&#1494;&#1500; with the accus.: flow down in tears, cf. Gesen. 138, 1, Rem. 2, Ew. 281, b.</body></html>
