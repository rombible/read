But even the desert, without communion with God, through Christ Jesus, and the influences of the Holy Spirit, must be a place for temptation and evil; while, with these blessings, we may live in holiness in crowded cities. The people accustomed their tongues to lies. So false were they, that a brother could not be trusted. In trading and bargaining they said any thing for their own advantage, though they knew it to be false. But God marked their sin. Where no knowledge of God is, what good can be expected?

The MT. has apparently suffered some corruption. The LXX yield a fairly good sense.

As Gi. points out, this does not obviate the objection that the verb rendered “weary themselves” always elsewhere (e.g. <a href="/isaiah/16-12.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, when it is seen that Moab is weary on the high place, that he shall come to his sanctuary to pray; but he shall not prevail.">Isaiah 16:12</a>; <a href="/isaiah/47-13.htm" title="You are wearied in the multitude of your counsels.

Hence, and for other reasons, he rejects <span class="ital"><a href="/context/jeremiah/9-4.htm" title="Take you heed every one of his neighbor, and trust you not in any brother: for every brother will utterly supplant, and every neighbor will walk with slanders....">Jeremiah 9:4-5</a></span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They have taught their tongue</span>, etc.; again an intimation of the unnaturalness (in the higher sense) of vice (comp. on Jeremiah 2:33). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The hopeless case of the people and kingdom moves the seer so deeply, that he bursts forth with the cry: For the breaking of my people I am broken (the Hoph. &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, of the breaking of the heart, only here; in this sig. usu. the Niph., e.g., <a href="/jeremiah/38-7.htm">Jeremiah 38:7</a>.

Help is nowhere to be found. This thought is in <a href="/jeremiah/8-22.htm">Jeremiah 8:22</a> clothed in the question: Is there no balm in Gilead, or no physician there? "There" points back to Gilead. Graf's remark, that "it is not known that the physicians were got from that quarter," shows nothing more than that its author has mistaken the figurative force of the words. &#1510;&#1512;&#1497;, balsam, is mentioned in <a href="/genesis/37-25.htm">Genesis 37:25</a> as an article of commerce carried by Midianite merchants to Egypt (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/27-17.htm">Ezekiel 27:17</a>), but is hardly the real balsam from Mecca (amyris opobalsamum), which during the Roman sovereignty was grown under culture in the gardens of Jericho, and which only succeeds in a climate little short of tropical. It was more likely the resina of the ancients, a gum procured from the terebinth or mastic tree (lentiscus, &#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;), which, acc. to Plin. h. nat. xxiv. 22, was held in esteem as a medicament for wounds (resolvitur resina ad vulnerum usus et malagmata oleo). Acc. to our passage and <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-11.htm">Jeremiah 46:11</a>, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/37-25.htm">Genesis 37:25</a>, it was procured chiefly from Gilead; cf. Movers, Phniz. ii. 3, S. 220ff., and the remarks on <a href="/genesis/37-25.htm">Genesis 37:25</a>. To these questions a negative answer is given. From this we explain the introduction of a further question with &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;: if there were balm in Gilead, and a physician there, then a plaister would have been laid on the daughter of my people, which is not the case. As to &#1506;&#1500;&#1514;&#1492; , lit., a plaister comes upon, see on <a href="/jeremiah/30-17.htm">Jeremiah 30:17</a>. </body></html>
