But even the desert, without communion with God, through Christ Jesus, and the influences of the Holy Spirit, must be a place for temptation and evil; while, with these blessings, we may live in holiness in crowded cities. The people accustomed their tongues to lies. So false were they, that a brother could not be trusted. In trading and bargaining they said any thing for their own advantage, though they knew it to be false. But God marked their sin. Where no knowledge of God is, what good can be expected?

Such was the result of clinging to an unprogressive religion - one which refused to be spiritualized by the prophets. Certainly, if the established religion was so inefficacious, it was self-condemned. Hero we find the prophet depicting a state of society in which the elementary bonds are already dissolved, and suspicion becomes the natural attitude even of a good man. We find a very similar picture in the last chapter of Micah - a chapter, it is true, which stands apart from the rest of the book, as it implies a greater development of wickedness than the rest of Micah and the contemporary prophecies of Isaiah would lead us to expect. Are these prophetic descriptions just and accurate? We may allow something, no doubt, for the warmth of feeling natural to every human preacher, even under the influence of inspiration; but we must not allow ourselves to explain away the obvious meaning of the prophets. The latter and their disciples were "the salt" of their country; and in proportion as their influence declined, the natural effects of a non-moral, purely ritualistic religion showed themselves on a larger scale. <span class="cmt_word">Every brother</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. every fellow-tribesman or fellow-citizen. <span class="cmt_word">Will utterly supplant</span>. There is nothing in the context to suggest an allusion to <a href="/genesis/27-36.htm">Genesis 27:36</a> (Jacob). The verb has its common sense of deceiving.

The suffix in &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468; refers to "daughter of my people," and the King is Jahveh; cf. <a href="/isaiah/33-22.htm">Isaiah 33:22</a>. They ask whether Jahveh is no longer King in Zion, that He may release His people from captivity and bring them back to Zion. To this the voice of God replies with the counter-question: Why have they provoked me with their idolatry, sc. so that I had to give them over into the power of the heathen for punishment? "Images" is expounded by the apposition: vanities (no-gods; for &#1492;&#1489;&#1500;, see on <a href="/jeremiah/2-5.htm">Jeremiah 2:5</a>) of a foreign land. Because they have chosen the empty idols from abroad (<a href="/isaiah/14-22.htm">Isaiah 14:22</a>) as their gods, Jahveh, the almighty God of Zion, has cast them out into a far country amidst strange people. The people goes on to complain in <a href="/jeremiah/8-20.htm">Jeremiah 8:20</a> : Past is the harvest...and we are not saved. As Schnur. remarked, these words have something of the proverb about them. As a country-man, hoping for a good harvest, falls into despair as to his chances, so the people have been in vain looking for its rescue and deliverance. The events, or combinations of events, to which it looked for its rescue are gone by without bringing any such result. Many ancient commentators, following Rashi, have given too special a significance to this verse in applying it to the assistance expected from Egypt in the time of Jehoiakim or Zedekiah. Hitz. is yet more mistaken when he takes the saying to refer to an unproductive harvest. From <a href="/jeremiah/8-19.htm">Jeremiah 8:19</a> we see that the words are spoken by the people while it pines in exile, which sets its hopes of being saved not in the productiveness of the harvest, but in a happy turn of the political situation.</body></html>
