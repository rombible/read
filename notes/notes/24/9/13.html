Unhumbled hearts lament their calamity, but not their sin, which is the cause of it. Let the doors be shut ever so fast, death steals upon us. It enters the palaces of princes and great men, though stately, strongly built, and guarded. Nor are those more safe that are abroad; death cuts off even the children from without, and the young men from the streets. Hearken to the word of the Lord, and mourn with godly sorrow.

Ew. has adopted this construction, and so translates: "have accustomed their tongue to speak lies, to do perversity, are weary of turning again; wrong upon wrong, deceit upon deceit, they are not willing to know me." But this text is not better, but worse, than the Masoretic: for, 1st, the perverse dealing or action is attributed to the tongue; 2nd, the thought, they are weary of turning again, does not suit the context, since the persons described here have never sought to return or repent, and so cannot have become weary of it. For these reasons, neither Hitz. nor Graf has given countenance to the lxx text.)<p>By reason of this depravity, the Lord must purge His people by sore judgments. He will melt it in the fire of affliction (<a href="/isaiah/48-10.htm">Isaiah 48:10</a>), to separate the wicked: cf. <a href="/isaiah/1-25.htm">Isaiah 1:25</a>; <a href="/zechariah/13-9.htm">Zechariah 13:9</a>; and on &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1503;, <a href="/jeremiah/6-27.htm">Jeremiah 6:27</a>. For how should I do, deal? Not: what dreadful judgments shall I inflict (Hitz., Gr.), in which case the grounding &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; would not have its proper force; but: I can do none otherwise than purge. Before the face of, i.e., by reason of, the daughter, because the daughter of my people behaves herself as has been described in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-2.htm">Jeremiah 9:2-4</a>, and as is yet to be briefly repeated in <a href="/jeremiah/9-7.htm">Jeremiah 9:7</a>.

This is true to the sense, but it is unfair to argue from it, as Ew., Hitz., Gr. do, that &#1512;&#1506;&#1514; has been dropped out of the Hebrew text and should be restored. - In <a href="/jeremiah/9-7.htm">Jeremiah 9:7</a> what has been said is recapitulated shortly, and then in <a href="/jeremiah/9-8.htm">Jeremiah 9:8</a> the necessity of the judgment is shown. &#1495;&#1509; &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1495;&#1496;, a slaying, slaughtering, i.e., murderous arrow. Instead of this Chet., which gives a good sense, the Keri gives &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1496;, which, judging from the Chald. translation, is probably to be translated sharpened. But there is no evidence for this sig., since &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1496; occurs only in connection with &#1494;&#1492;&#1489;, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/10-16.htm">1 Kings 10:16</a>, and means beaten, lit., spread gold. At &#1502;&#1512;&#1502;&#1492; &#1491;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; the plural passes into the singular: he (one of them) speaks; cf. <a href="/psalms/55-22.htm">Psalm 55:22</a>. &#1488;&#1512;&#1489; for insidious scheming, as in <a href="/hosea/7-6.htm">Hosea 7:6</a>.
