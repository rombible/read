The words rest upon the idea that wailing was an art, its cries and tones skilfully adapted to the special sorrows of which it was in theory the expression. They perhaps imply also that death would do its work so terribly that the demand for mourners would be greater than the supply, and that supernumeraries must be trained to meet it. Looking to the many other coincidences between our Lord’s teaching and that of Jeremiah, it is not too much to see in His words to the daughter of Jerusalem, “Weep for yourselves and for your children” (<a href="/context/luke/23-27.htm" title="And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him.">Luke 23:27-28</a>), a parallel to what we read here.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:12-22 In Zion the voice of joy and praise used to be heard, while the people kept close to God; but sin has altered the sound, it is now the voice of lamentation. Unhumbled hearts lament their calamity, but not their sin, which is the cause of it. Let the doors be shut ever so fast, death steals upon us. It enters the palaces of princes and great men, though stately, strongly built, and guarded. Nor are those more safe that are abroad; death cuts off even the children from without, and the young men from the streets. Hearken to the word of the Lord, and mourn with godly sorrow. This alone can bring true comfort; and it can turn the heaviest afflictions into precious mercies.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The command is addressed to the women because it was more especially their part to express the general feelings of the nation.

This wailing and lamentation was made by responses, according to the Jews; for they say (d), <p>"what is lamentation? when one speaks, and all the rest answer after her, as it is written in <a href="/jeremiah/9-20.htm">Jeremiah 9:20</a>.'' <p>(d) Misn.

To feed with wormwood and give gall to drink is a figure for sore and bitter suffering at the overthrow of the kingdom and in exile. The meaning of the suffix in &#1502;&#1488;&#1499;&#1497;&#1500;&#1501; is shown by the apposition: this people. On water of gall see <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-14.htm">Jeremiah 8:14</a>, and for the use of &#1500;&#1506;&#1504;&#1492; and &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; together see <a href="/deuteronomy/29-17.htm">Deuteronomy 29:17</a>. - '&#1492;&#1508;&#1497;&#1510;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; implies a verbal allusion to the words of <a href="/deuteronomy/28-64.htm">Deuteronomy 28:64</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-36.htm">Deuteronomy 28:36</a>, cf. <a href="/leviticus/26-33.htm">Leviticus 26:33</a>. With this latter passage the second clause: I send the sword after them, has a close affinity. The purport of it is: I send the sword after the fugitives, to pursue them into foreign lands and slay them; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/42-16.htm">Jeremiah 42:16</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/44-27.htm">Jeremiah 44:27</a>. Thus it is indicated that those who fled into Egypt would be reached by the sword there and slain. This does not stand in contradiction to what is said in <a href="/jeremiah/4-27.htm">Jeremiah 4:27</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-18.htm">Jeremiah 5:18</a>, etc., to the effect that God will not make an utter end of them (Graf's opinion). This appears from <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-27.htm">Jeremiah 44:27</a>, where those that flee to Egypt are threatened with destruction by famine and sword &#1506;&#1491; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497; &#1488;&#1493;, while <a href="/jeremiah/44-28.htm">Jeremiah 44:28</a> continues: but they that have escaped the sword shall return. Hence we see that the terms of the threatening do not imply the extirpation of the people to the last man, but only the extirpation of all the godless, of this wicked people.</body></html>
