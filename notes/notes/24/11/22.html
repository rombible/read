Those of his own city plotted how they might cause his death. They thought to end his days, but he outlived most of his enemies; they thought to blast his memory, but it lives to this day, and will be blessed while time lasts. God knows all the secret designs of his and his people's enemies, and can, when he pleases, make them known. God's justice is a terror to the wicked, but a comfort to the godly. When we are wronged, we have a God to commit our cause to, and it is our duty to commit it to him. We should also look well to our own spirits, that we are not overcome with evil, but that by patient continuance in praying for our enemies, and in kindness to them, we may overcome evil with good.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The young men - i. e., those of the legal age for military service. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22.

Judah (Israel) was truly a noble planting of God's, but by defection from the Lord, its God and Creator, it has drawn down on itself this ruin. Jahveh called Judah a green olive with splendid fruit. For a comparison of Israel to an olive, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/14-7.htm">Hosea 14:7</a>, <a href="/psalms/52-10.htm">Psalm 52:10</a>; <a href="/psalms/128-3.htm">Psalm 128:3</a>. The fruit of the tree is the nation in its individual members. The naming of the name is the representation of the state of the case, and so here: the growth and prosperity of the people. The contrasted state is introduced by &#1500;&#1511;&#1493;&#1500; &#1492;' without adversative particle, and is thus made to seem the more abrupt and violent (Hitz.). Noise of tumult (&#1492;&#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;, occurring besides here only in <a href="/ezekiel/1-24.htm">Ezekiel 1:24</a> as equivalent to &#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503;), i.e., of the tumult of war, cf. <a href="/isaiah/13-4.htm">Isaiah 13:4</a>; not: roar of the thunderstorm or crash of thunder (Ng., Graf). &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492; for &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468; (OT:871a), cf. <a href="/jeremiah/17-27.htm">Jeremiah 17:27</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-14.htm">Jeremiah 21:14</a>, etc. The suffix is regulated by the thing represented by the olive, i.e., Judah as a kingdom. Its branches brake; &#1512;&#1506;&#1506;, elsewhere only transitive, here intransitive, analogously to &#1512;&#1510;&#1509; in <a href="/isaiah/42-4.htm">Isaiah 42:4</a>. Hitz. renders less suitably: its branches look bad, as being charred, robbed of their gay adornment. On this head cf. <a href="/ezekiel/31-12.htm">Ezekiel 31:12</a>. The setting of fire to the olive tree Israel came about through its enemies, who broke up one part of the kingdom after the other, who had already destroyed the kingdom of the ten tribes, and were now about to destroy Judah next. That the words apply not to Judah only, but to Israel as well, appears from <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-17.htm">Jeremiah 11:17</a>, where the Lord, who has planted Israel, is said to have spoken, i.e., decreed evil for the sin of the two houses, Israel and Judah. &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; is not directly  equals  decree, but intimates also the utterance of the decree by the prophet. &#1500;&#1492;&#1501; after &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468; is dat. incomm.: the evil which they have done to their hurt; cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-3.htm">Jeremiah 44:3</a>, where the dative is wanting. Hitz. finds in &#1500;&#1492;&#1501; an intimation of voluntary action, as throwing back the deed upon the subject as an act of free choice; cf. Ew. 315, a. </body></html>
