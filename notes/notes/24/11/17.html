Their profession of religion shall prove of no use. When trouble came upon them, they made this their confidence, but God has rejected it. His altar shall yield them no satisfaction.

God is invulnerable, we cannot hurt him, though we may provoke his justice to take vengeance upon us for our iniquities.
