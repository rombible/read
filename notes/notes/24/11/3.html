The rendering "covenant," however, is not so much erroneous as unsuitable in this context; it is a secondary meaning of the Hebrew <span class="accented">b'rith</span>, the original sense being rather "authoritative appointment" (from <span class="accented">barah</span>, to cut, hence to decide). Nothing, perhaps, is so injurious to a correct understanding of the Scriptures as persistently rendering a Hebrew or Greek word by the same supposed equivalent. "Covenant" is no doubt appropriate in some passages (e.g. <a href="/joshua/9-6.htm">Joshua 9:6</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/18-3.htm">1 Samuel 18:3</a>), because an "appointment" between men, if equals, involves "giving and taking;" but is inadequate when the parties are not equals, and most of all when the superior party is the Divine Being. In these cases we must clearly recur to the original meaning of" appointment" or "ordinance;" and we have one such case here (see also <a href="/hosea/6-7.htm">Hosea 6:7</a>; <a href="/2_kings/11-4.htm">2 Kings 11:4</a>; <a href="/job/31-1.htm">Job 31:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/105-10.htm">Psalm 105:10</a>; but <span class="accented">not</span> <a href="/genesis/17-9.htm">Genesis 17:9</a>). <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span> (1, an arrangement; 2, a will or testament; 3, a covenant) is to some extent parallel (see Cremer's 'Biblico-Theological Lexicon of New Testament Greek,' <span class="accented">s</span>.<span class="accented">v</span>.). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The cause of this calamity is that the shepherds, i.e., the princes and leaders of the people (see on <a href="/jeremiah/2-8.htm">Jeremiah 2:8</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/3-15.htm">Jeremiah 3:15</a>), are become brutish, have not sought Jahveh, i.e., have not sought wisdom and guidance from the Lord. And so they could not deal wisely, i.e., rule the people with wisdom. &#1492;&#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500; is here not merely: have prosperity, but: show wisdom, deal wisely, securing thus the blessed results of wisdom. This is shown both by the contrasted "become brutish" and by the parallel passage, <a href="/jeremiah/3-15.htm">Jeremiah 3:15</a>. &#1502;&#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1514;&#1501;, their pasturing, equivalent to "flock of their pasturing," their flock, <a href="/jeremiah/23-1.htm">Jeremiah 23:1</a>.<p>The calamity over which the people mourns is drawing near, <a href="/jeremiah/10-22.htm">Jeremiah 10:22</a>. Already is heard the tremendous din of a mighty host which approaches from the north to make the cities of Judah a wilderness. &#1511;&#1493;&#1500; &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492; is an exclamation: listen to the rumour, it is coming near. From a grammatical point of view the subject to "comes" is "rumour," but in point of sense it is that of which the rumour gives notice. Graf weakens the sense by gathering the words into one assertory clause: "They hear a rumour come." The "great commotion" is that of an army on the march, the clattering of the weapons, the stamping and neighing of the war-horses; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/6-23.htm">Jeremiah 6:23</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/8-16.htm">Jeremiah 8:16</a>. From the land of midnight, the north, cf. <a href="/jeremiah/1-14.htm">Jeremiah 1:14</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-6.htm">Jeremiah 4:6</a>, etc. "To make the cities," etc., cf. <a href="/jeremiah/4-7.htm">Jeremiah 4:7</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/9-10.htm">Jeremiah 9:10</a>. - The rumour of the enemy's approach drives the people to prayer, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-23.htm">Jeremiah 10:23-25</a>. The prayer of these verses is uttered in the name of the congregation. It begins with the confession: Not with man is his way, i.e., it is not within man's power to arrange the course of his life, nor in the power of the man who walks to fix his step (&#1493;before &#1492;&#1499;&#1497;&#1503; merely marking the connection of the thought: cf. Ew. 348, a). The antithesis to &#1500;&#1488;&#1491;&#1501; and &#1500;&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; is &#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;, with God; cf. <a href="/psalms/37-23.htm">Psalm 37:23</a>; <a href="/proverbs/16-9.htm">Proverbs 16:9</a> : Man's heart deviseth his way, but Jahveh establisheth the steps. The thought is not: it is not in man's option to walk in straight or crooked, good or evil ways, but: the directing of man, the way by which he must go, lies not in his own but in God's power. Hitz. justly finds here the wisdom that admits: "Mit unserer Macht ist nichts getan," - man's destiny is ordained not by himself, but by God. Upon this acquiescence in God's dispensation of events follows the petition: Chasten me, for I have deserved punishment, but chasten &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;, acc. to right, not in Thine anger; cf. <a href="/psalms/6-2.htm">Psalm 6:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/38-2.htm">Psalm 38:2</a>. A chastening in anger is the judgment of wrath that shall fall on obstinate sinners and destroy them. A chastening acc. to right is one such as is demanded by right (judgment), as the issue of God's justice, in order to the reclamation and conversion of the repentant sinner. "Lest Thou make me little," insignificant, puny; not merely, diminish me, make me smaller than I now am. For such a decrease of the people would result even from a gentle chastisement. There is no comparative force in the words. To make small, in other words, reduce to a small, insignificant people. This would be at variance with "right," with God's ordained plan in regard to His people. The expression is not equivalent to: not to make an utter end, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-11.htm">Jeremiah 30:11</a>, etc. The people had no call to pray that they might escape being made an utter end of; thus much had been promised by God, <a href="/jeremiah/4-27.htm">Jeremiah 4:27</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/5-10.htm">Jeremiah 5:10</a>. - God is asked to pour forth His fury upon the heathen who know not the Lord nor call upon His name, because they seek to extirpate Jacob (the people of Israel) as the people of God, at this time found in Judah alone. The several words in <a href="/jeremiah/10-25.htm">Jeremiah 10:25</a> suggest the fury with which the heathen proceed to the destruction of Israel. The present verse is reproduced in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/79-6.htm">Psalm 79:6-7</a>, a psalm written during the exile, or at least after the destruction of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans; but in the reproduction the energetic expansion of the "devoured" is omitted. </body></html>
