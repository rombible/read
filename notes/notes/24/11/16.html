The olive tree is "one of the most thriving, hardy, and productive trees in the East" (it was the first tree elected king in the parable, <a href="/judges/9-8.htm">Judges 9:8</a>), and with its "foliage of a deep, perennial green," furnishes a striking symbol of healthful beauty. A psalmist, speaking in the character of the typical righteous man, compares himself to a "green olive tree in the house of God' (<a href="/psalms/52-8.htm">Psalm 52:8</a>). The word rendered "green "is one of those which are the despair of translators (see on Jeremiah 2:20). It gives a picture in itself. We seem to see a flourishing, sappy tree, with abundance of pliant, gracefully moving, perennially green branches. <span class="cmt_word">With the noise of a great tumult.</span> Either the tumult of the <span class="accented">melee</span> of battle is meant (the same uncommon word is used with such a reference in <a href="/ezekiel/1-24.htm">Ezekiel 1:24</a>) or the crashing of thunder.

(For the concluding figure, comp. <a href="/ezekiel/31-12.htm">Ezekiel 31:12</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">He hath kindled fire</span>, etc. There is no occasion to explain this as merely the perfect of prophetic certitude. It was literally true that the fire of war had already devastated the fairest portion of the Holy Land. Israel (expressly referred to in Ver. 17) had already been carried into captivity, and Judah was, to the prophetic eye, as good as destroyed. Here, no doubt, that wonderful perfect of faith does come in. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The people's breach of the covenant, and the consequences of this. - <a href="/jeremiah/11-9.htm">Jeremiah 11:9</a>. "And Jahveh said unto me: Conspiracy is found among the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. <a href="/jeremiah/11-10.htm">Jeremiah 11:10</a>.

For as many as are thy cities, so many are thy gods become, O Judah; and as many as are the streets of Jerusalem, so many altars have ye set up to Shame, altars to offer odours to Baal."<p>Jeremiah is once more to enforce the words of the covenant upon the people, because they have broken the covenant, returned to the idolatry of the fathers. Conspiracy is found, is to be seen. The people's defection from Jahveh, their breach of faith towards the covenant God, is called conspiracy, because it had become as universal as if it had been initiated by a formal preconcertment. "The former fathers," forefathers of the people, are the Israelites under Moses, who broke the covenant by idolatry while still at Sinai, and those of the time of the Judges. With &#1493;&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; the subject is changed; "they" are not the forefathers, but the prophet's contemporaries. In the last clause of <a href="/jeremiah/11-10.htm">Jeremiah 11:10</a> is comprehended the apostasy of the whole people: Like Israel, Judah too has broken the covenant. Israel has been punished for this by being cast out among the heathen, the like doom awaits Judah.</body></html>
