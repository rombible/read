Learned men say that the Asians called the same idol Baal, whom those of Europe called Jupiter. It is not improbable which learned men judge, that the heathens acknowledging one Supreme Being, worshipped him in several creatures; some mistaking the <span class="ital">sun, moon, and stars</span> to be he, others other things; these they called <span class="ital">Baalim</span>, lords, as they called the principal god Baal. The heathens’ idolatry seems to be their worshipping God <span class="ital">in creatures</span>, and paying a divine homage to creatures, the sun, moon, and stars, and other far inferior to them, not believing that those creatures were the Divine Being, but that the Divine Being was in them, and from them would hear their supplicants, and do them good; which, though the heathens might a little be excused in, having no Scriptures showing them the nature of the true God, and how he would be worshipped; yet in the Jews was inexcusable, they having the oracles of God committed to them, which both showed them the true nature of God, and let them know that no creature could be any similitude or representation of him; and that his will was, that they should pay their homage to him without any similitudes or representations exciting them to that homage, fit for nothing but to beget in the minds of people false conceptions and apprehensions of the Divine Being, which is merely spiritual; notwithstanding which direction from the Divine law, the Jews, after the manner of the heathens, would pay their homage to God before the sun, moon, and stars, and before images made with hands, and make altars to such creatures and images, which was the idolatry God complains of, and of which he declares a greater abhorrence than almost of any other sin. It is likely that <span class="ital">Baal</span> here mentioned was the sun, because it was near Manasseh’s times, who thus highly offended God; and it is probable that though Josiah had begun a famous reformation. yet a great deal of this leaven was left in the common people; besides that the sins of Manasseh, <span class="bld"><a href="/2_kings/23-26.htm" title="Notwithstanding the LORD turned not from the fierceness of his great wrath, with which his anger was kindled against Judah, because of all the provocations that Manasseh had provoked him with.">2 Kings 23:26</a></span>, are reckoned up as the special proximate cause of this wrath of God against Judah. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For according to the number of thy cities were thy gods, O Judah,....
