A conjectural emendation, following the LXX., gives, <span class= "ital">will thy vows and the holy flesh remove thy evil from thee<span class= "bld"> . . .</span></span> The general sense is, however, clear. A religion of mere ritual-sacrifices and the like will not avail to save. The Hebrew for “lewdness” does not convey the idea which we now attach to the English word, but means primarily a plan of any kind, and then a “device” or “scheme” in a bad sense, as in <a href="/psalms/10-2.htm" title="The wicked in his pride does persecute the poor: let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined.">Psalm 10:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/21-11.htm" title="For they intended evil against you: they imagined a mischievous device, which they are not able to perform.">Psalm 21:11</a>; <a href="/proverbs/14-17.htm" title="He that is soon angry deals foolishly: and a man of wicked devices is hated.">Proverbs 14:17</a>. Probably the translators, here, as in <a href="/acts/17-5.htm" title="But the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took to them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people.">Acts 17:5</a>; <a href="/acts/18-14.htm" title="And when Paul was now about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O you Jews, reason would that I should bear with you:">Acts 18:14</a>, used the word in this more general sense. Primarily, indeed, “lewd” in Old English was simply the opposite of “learned.”<p><span class= "bld">When thou doest evil, then thou rejoicest.</span>—The clause is involved in the same difficulty as the rest of the verse. The English version is tenable, and gives an adequate meaning.

The learned author of our English Annotations notes, that the words may very fairly be translated, <span class="ital">and the holy flesh they shall pass away from thee</span>; so the words import a threatening, that because they had polluted and profaned the sacrifices, God would make their sacrifices to cease. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">When thou doest evil, then thou rejoicest:</span> and this the Lord would rather do against them, because they were not only evil, but gloried in their wickedness, or at least were full of mirth and jollity as if they had done no iniquity. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>What hath my beloved to do in mine house,.... These are either the words of the prophet, as Kimchi and Ben Melech think, speaking after this manner; what has God, who is my beloved, he whom my soul loves, and who loves me, to do in the sanctuary, which is my house, and not this people's, that have defiled it, to cause his Shechinah to dwell there, after so much wickedness has been committed in it? and so Cocceius interprets it of Christ the beloved Son of God, and the beloved of his church and people, withdrawing from the temple, because of the wickedness of the Jews; or they are the words of God concerning the people of the Jews, who were beloved for the Father's sake; signifying that now, because of their abominations, it was not fitting they should continue in the house of God, or have any shelter and protection there. The Jews interpret (k) this of Abraham: <p>seeing she hath wrought lewdness with many; that is, the congregation of Israel, or the church of the Jews, had committed idolatry with many idols; or it was not only a few of them that were guilty of this sin, but a multitude, even their great men, the princes and nobles: <p>and the holy flesh is passed from thee? which Kimchi and Ben Melech understand of holy and good men, who ceased from among them, were perished and gone; and Jarchi, of the circumcision of the flesh, which was neglected: but it seems best to interpret it of the flesh of sacrifices; which were either laid aside by them, or, if offered and eaten of, were of no service to them, being offered up with a wicked mind; or rather the meaning is, the time was come that these were at an end, the temple being destroyed: <p>when thou doest evil; the evil of sin; or "when thine evil is" (l); the evil of punishment is coming upon thee: <p>then thou rejoicest; instead of repenting of sin, and mourning for it, or being humbled at approaching judgments, gave themselves up to sensual lusts and pleasures; neither concerned at the one nor at the other; neither grieved for sin, nor trembled at punishment; but amidst all were brisk and jovial; though some say (m) the word has the signification of trembling; and render it, "then thou shalt tremble". The Targum of the whole is, <p>"What (have I to do) with this people, that was beloved before me? they have left the worship of the house of my sanctuary; they have took counsel to sin much; they mingle the flesh of abominations with the holy flesh; they shall go into captivity from thee; because of thy wickedness thou art strong.'' <p>(k) T.

"My beloved" is evidently the Jewish people, who in <a href="/jeremiah/12-7.htm">Jeremiah 12:7</a> is called "the dearly beloved of my soul." The Divine Speaker expresses surprise that one who has now so poor a claim to the title of "my beloved" should appear in his holy house. It is spoken in the spirit of that earlier revelation of Isaiah, "When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand, to trample my courts?" (<a href="/isaiah/1-12.htm">Isaiah 1:12</a>).  The Jews, it would seem, came to the temple to pray, but their prayer is not accepted, because it is associated with unholy practices. They thought by formal prayers and sacrifices to pay off their debt to the Deity, and so be free to go on with their old devices (as in <a href="/jeremiah/7-15.htm">Jeremiah 7:15</a>). This seems the best view of the difficult words which follow, but it implies a correction of the certainly ungrammatical rendering of the Authorized Version - <span class="cmt_word">seeing she hath wrought lewdness</span>  - into <span class="accented">to work the wicked device</span>. But here begins the most obscure part of the verse. <span class="cmt_word">With many</span> cannot be right; for "with" has nothing corresponding to it in the Hebrew; the word in the original simply means "the many," and as it is immediately followed by a noun in the singular with "and," and a verb in the plural, it is plain that it must (if correctly read) be part of the subject of the latter. The Septuagint, however, has a different reading, which may very well be correct, and out of which the received Hebrew reading may easily have grown - "Can vows and holy [i.e. hallowed] flesh remove from thee thy wickedness [or perhaps, 'thy calamity']?" The connection thus becomes easy. "Vows and holy flesh" (i.e. the flesh of sacrifices, <a href="/haggai/2-12.htm">Haggai 2:12</a>), naturally go together; the only other possible way of taking the passage (assuming the correctness of the 'received text) - " the great ones and the holy flesh shall pass away from thee" - is obviously inadmissible. "Vows and sacrifices," however, precisely express the true association of ideas. A man made a vow, and he generally paid it in the form of a sacrifice. But, inquires Jehovah, "Can such vows and such Victims please God, and expiate thy wickedness [or, 'avert thy calamity']? <span class="accented">Then thou mightest rejoice</span>." The latter words are not, indeed, more exact than those of the Authorized Version, but are in accordance with grammar, and suit the preceding question. It is not certain, however, that the text is right here; the Septuagint has <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3be;&#x1fc3;</span>. (Notice that Keil, conservative to a fault in matters affecting the received text, agrees with the above correction, which is also adopted by Ewald, Hitzig, and Graf.) <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The people's breach of the covenant, and the consequences of this. - <a href="/jeremiah/11-9.htm">Jeremiah 11:9</a>. "And Jahveh said unto me: Conspiracy is found among the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. <a href="/jeremiah/11-10.htm">Jeremiah 11:10</a>. They are turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, which refused to give ear to my words, and they are gone after other gods to serve them; the house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant which I made with their fathers. <a href="/jeremiah/11-11.htm">Jeremiah 11:11</a>.

For as many as are thy cities, so many are thy gods become, O Judah; and as many as are the streets of Jerusalem, so many altars have ye set up to Shame, altars to offer odours to Baal."<p>Jeremiah is once more to enforce the words of the covenant upon the people, because they have broken the covenant, returned to the idolatry of the fathers. Conspiracy is found, is to be seen. The people's defection from Jahveh, their breach of faith towards the covenant God, is called conspiracy, because it had become as universal as if it had been initiated by a formal preconcertment. "The former fathers," forefathers of the people, are the Israelites under Moses, who broke the covenant by idolatry while still at Sinai, and those of the time of the Judges. With &#1493;&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; the subject is changed; "they" are not the forefathers, but the prophet's contemporaries. In the last clause of <a href="/jeremiah/11-10.htm">Jeremiah 11:10</a> is comprehended the apostasy of the whole people: Like Israel, Judah too has broken the covenant. Israel has been punished for this by being cast out among the heathen, the like doom awaits Judah.</body></html>
