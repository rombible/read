The proper work and office of Christ, as Mediator, is to draw near unto God, for us, as the High Priest of our profession. His own undertaking, in compliance with his Father's will, and in compassion to fallen man, engaged him. Jesus Christ was, in all this, truly wonderful. They shall be taken again into covenant with the Lord, according to the covenant made with their fathers. I will be your God: it is his good-will to us, which is the summary of that part of the covenant. The wrath of God against the wicked is very terrible, like a whirlwind. The purposes of his wrath, as well as the purposes of his love, will all be fulfilled. God will comfort all that turn to him; but those who approach him must have their hearts engaged to do it with reverence, devotion, and faith. How will they escape who neglect so great salvation?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Compare the marginal reference.

"Thus saith Jahveh: Behold, I will turn the captivity of the tents of Jacob, and will take pity on his dwellings; and the city shall be built again upon its own hill, and the palace shall be inhabited after its own fashion. <a href="/jeremiah/30-19.htm">Jeremiah 30:19</a>. And there shall come forth from them praise and the voice of those who laugh; and I will multiply them, so that they shall not be few, and I will honour them, so that they shall not be mean. <a href="/jeremiah/30-20.htm">Jeremiah 30:20</a>. And his sons shall be as in former times, and his congregation shall be established before me, and I will punish all that oppress him. <a href="/jeremiah/30-21.htm">Jeremiah 30:21</a>. And his leader shall spring from himself, and his ruler shall proceed from his midst; and I will bring him near, so that he shall approach to me; for who is he that became surety for his life in drawing near to me? saith Jahveh. <a href="/jeremiah/30-22.htm">Jeremiah 30:22</a>. And ye shall become my people, and I will be your God."<p>The dwellings of Israel that have been laid waste, and the cities that have been destroyed, shall be restored and inhabited as formerly, so that songs of praise and tones of joy shall resound from them (<a href="/jeremiah/30-18.htm">Jeremiah 30:18</a>.). "The captivity of the tents of Jacob" means the miserable condition of the dwellings of Jacob, i.e., of all Israel; for "to turn the captivity" has everywhere a figurative sense, and signifies the turning of adversity and misery into prosperity and comfort; see on <a href="/jeremiah/29-14.htm">Jeremiah 29:14</a>. Hitzig is quite wrong in his rendering: "I bring back the captives of the tents of Jacob, i.e., those who have been carried away out of the tents." That "tents" does not stand for those who dwell in tents, but is a poetic expression for "habitations," is perfectly clear from the parallel "his dwellings." To "take pity on the dwellings" means to "restore the dwellings that have been destroyed" (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/9-18.htm">Jeremiah 9:18</a>). The anarthrous &#1506;&#1497;&#1512; must not be restricted to the capital, but means every city that has been destroyed; here, the capital naturally claims the first consideration. "Upon its hills" is equivalent to saying on its former site, cf. <a href="/joshua/11-13.htm">Joshua 11:13</a>; it does not mean "on the mound made by its ruins," in support of which Ngelsbach erroneously adduces <a href="/deuteronomy/13-17.htm">Deuteronomy 13:17</a>. &#1488;&#1512;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503; in like manner stands, in the most general way, for every palace. &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;&#1493; does not mean "on the proper place," i.e., on an open, elevated spot on the hill (Hitzig), neither does it mean "on its right position" (Ewald); both of these renderings are against the usage of the words: but it signifies "according to its right" (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/17-11.htm">Deuteronomy 17:11</a>), i.e., in accordance with what a palace requires, after its own fashion. &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;, to be inhabited, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-6.htm">Jeremiah 17:6</a>, etc. "Out of them" refers to the cities and palaces. Thence proceeds, resounds praise or thanksgiving for the divine grace shown them (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/33-11.htm">Jeremiah 33:11</a>), and the voice, i.e., the tones or sounds, of those who laugh (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/15-17.htm">Jeremiah 15:17</a>), i.e., of the people living in the cities and palaces, rejoicing over their good fortune. "I will increase them, so that they shall not become fewer," cf. <a href="/jeremiah/29-6.htm">Jeremiah 29:6</a>; "I will bring them to honour (cf. <a href="/isaiah/8-22.htm">Isaiah 8:22</a>), so that they shall not be lightly esteemed." - In <a href="/jeremiah/30-20.htm">Jeremiah 30:20</a>. the singular suffixes refer to Jacob as a nation (<a href="/jeremiah/30-18.htm">Jeremiah 30:18</a>). "His sons" are the members of the nation; they become as they were previously, in former times - sicut olim sub Davide et Salmonoe, florentissimo rerum statu. "The congregation will be established before me," i.e., under my survey (&#1514;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1503; as in <a href="/psalms/102-29.htm">Psalm 102:29</a>), i.e., they shall no more be shaken or moved from their position.</body></html>
