The words may be rendered, "I will cause length to ascend unto thee"; or a long plaster (z); or rather, that which has been long looked for, and long in coming, prosperity; or else, that whereas they were before bowed down with afflictions and sorrows, now they should be as a man in an erect posture, that rises up in his full height and length, being in a robust and healthful state; <p>and I will heal thee of thy wounds, saith the Lord; pardon their sins, remove their afflictions, and bring them into a comfortable situation, into a Gospel church state, and into their own land: <p>because they called thee an outcast; as the Jews now are, cast out of their own land, rejected from being the people of God; so they are reckoned by the nations among whom they are: <p>saying, this is Zion, whom no man seeketh after: after their good, either temporal or spiritual; despised by most, pitied and prayed for by few; and fewer still they are that seek after, and are solicitous about, or take any methods, or make use of any means, for their conversion; but though man does not, God will, and his work will appear the more manifest. <p>(z)   "adducam tibi emplastrum longum", so some in Gataker; "faciam ut ad justam constitutionem assurgas", Junius &amp; Tremellius; "ut assurgat sanitas tibi", Piscator; "nam faciam ut ascendat tibi proceritas", Cocceius. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/30.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For I will restore health unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds, saith the LORD; because they called thee an Outcast, saying, This is Zion, whom no man seeketh after.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/30.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">17</span>. <span class="ital">I will restore health unto thee</span>] better, <span class="ital">I will bring new flesh upon thee</span>.

The only expression which, besides the repetition made in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-27.htm">Jeremiah 46:27</a>, occurs nowhere else in Jeremiah, but frequently in the second Isaiah, is, "my servant Jacob;" cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/44-1.htm">Isaiah 44:1-2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/45-4.htm">Isaiah 45:4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/48-20.htm">Isaiah 48:20</a> and <a href="/isaiah/41-8.htm">Isaiah 41:8</a>; <a href="/isaiah/44-21.htm">Isaiah 44:21</a>; <a href="/isaiah/49-3.htm">Isaiah 49:3</a>.
