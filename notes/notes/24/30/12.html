For I am with thee, saith Jahveh, to save thee; for I will make an end of all the nations whither I have scattered thee, yet of thee will I not make an end, but I will chastise thee properly and will not let thee go quite unpunished."<p>With <a href="/jeremiah/30-4.htm">Jeremiah 30:4</a> is introduced the description of Israel's restoration announced in <a href="/jeremiah/30-3.htm">Jeremiah 30:3</a>. This introduction is not absolutely necessary, but neither is it for that reason spurious and to be expunged, as Hitzig seeks to do; it rather corresponds to the breadth of Jeremiah's representation. The &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; in <a href="/jeremiah/30-5.htm">Jeremiah 30:5</a> is explicative: "Thus, namely, hath Jahveh spoken." With the lively dramatic power of a poet, the prophet at once transports the hearers or readers of his prophecy, in thought, into the great day to come, which is to bring deliverance to all Israel. As a day of judgment, it brings terror and anguish on all those who live to see it. &#1511;&#1493;&#1500; &#1495;&#1512;&#1491;&#1492;, "A voice (sound) of trembling (or terror) we hear," viz., the people, of whom the prophet is one. &#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1491; does not depend on &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, but forms with &#1493;&#1488;&#1497;&#1503; &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501; an independent clause: "There is fear and not peace" (or safety). <a href="/jeremiah/30-6.htm">Jeremiah 30:6</a>. What is the cause of this great horror, which makes all men, from convulsive pains, hold their hands on their loins, so as to support their bowels, in which they feel the pangs, and which makes every countenance pale? In <a href="/jeremiah/30-7.htm">Jeremiah 30:7</a> the cause of this horror is declared. It is the great day of judgment that is coming. "That (not hits) day" points to the future, and thus, even apart from other reasons, excludes the supposition that it is the day of the destruction of Jerusalem that is meant. The words "that day is great" refer to <a href="//biblehub.com/joel/2-11.htm">Joel 2:11</a>, and "there is none like it" is an imitation of <a href="/joel/2-2.htm">Joel 2:2</a>; in the latter passage the prophet makes use of a judgment which he had seen passed on Judah - its devastation by locusts - and for the first time presents, as the main element in his prophecy, the idea of the great day of judgment to come on all nations, and by which the Lord will perfect His kingdom on this earth. This day is for Jacob also, i.e., for all Israel, a time of distress; for the judgment falls not merely on the heathen nations, but also on the godless members of the covenant people, that they may be destroyed from among the congregation of the Lord. The judgment is therefore for Israel as well as for other nations a critical juncture, from which the Israel of God, the community of the faithful, will be delivered. This deliverance is described more in detail in <a href="/jeremiah/30-8.htm">Jeremiah 30:8</a>. The Lord will break the yoke imposed on Israel, free His people from all bondage to strangers, i.e., the heathen, so that they may serve only Him, the Lord, and David, His king, whom He will raise up. The suffix in &#1506;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493; is referred by several expositors (Hitzig, Ngelsbach) to the king of Babylon, "as having been most clearly before the minds of Jeremiah and his contemporaries;" in support of this view we are pointed to <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/10-27.htm">Isaiah 10:27</a>, as a passage which may have been before the eyes of Jeremiah. But neither this parallel passage nor &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;&#1498; (with the suffix of the second person), which immediately follows, sufficiently justifies this view. For, in the second half also of the verse, the second person is interchanged with the third, and &#1502;&#1493;&#1505;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1498;, which is parallel with &#1506;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;, requires us to refer the suffix in the latter word to Jacob, so that "his yoke" means "the yoke laid on him," as in <a href="/1_kings/12-4.htm">1 Kings 12:4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/9-3.htm">Isaiah 9:3</a>. It is also to be borne in mind that, throughout the whole prophecy, neither Babylon nor the king of Babylon is once mentioned; and that the judgment described in these verses cannot possibly be restricted to the downfall of the Babylonian monarchy, but is the judgment that is to fall upon all nations (<a href="/jeremiah/30-11.htm">Jeremiah 30:11</a>). And although this judgment begins with the fall of the Babylonian supremacy, it will bring deliverance to the people of God, not merely from the yoke of Babylon, but from every yoke which strangers have laid or will lay on them.</body></html>
