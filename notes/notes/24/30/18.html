They shall be taken again into covenant with the Lord, according to the covenant made with their fathers. I will be your God: it is his good-will to us, which is the summary of that part of the covenant. The wrath of God against the wicked is very terrible, like a whirlwind. The purposes of his wrath, as well as the purposes of his love, will all be fulfilled.

The Targum is, <p>"I will have mercy on his cities;'' <p>and the city shall be builded upon her own heap; the city of Jerusalem, as the Targum expresses it, as it was in the times of Zerubbabel; it was built in its place, as the same Targum; upon the very spot of ground where it before stood, which was become by its desolation a heap of rubbish: or, "upon its hill" (a); Mount Moriah, on which some part of the city was built; so likewise in the latter day: though Jerusalem was destroyed by the Romans, and is now in a desolate condition, yet it shall be rebuilt, as it seems by this prophecy, upon the very spot where it formerly stood; <p>and the palace shall remain after the manner thereof; which the Targum interprets of the house of the sanctuary, the temple; so Jarchi; and it was true of it in Zerubbabel's time: but as this prophecy has a further view to future times, something else seems intended. Kimchi says it is either the king's palace or the temple. The singular may be put for the plural, and design "palaces", noble and stately buildings; signifying that the city shall be rebuilt in a very grand manner: and so "shall remain after the manner of it"; or, "according to its right" or "judgment" (b); it shall be continued and established by or upon that justice and judgment that shall be done in it; for it shall be called a city of righteousness, and a faithful city, <a href="/isaiah/1-26.htm">Isaiah 1:26</a>. <p>(a)  "colle suo", Vatablus.

For I will put a plaster on thee, and will heal thee of thy wounds, saith Jahveh; for they call thee an outcast, [and say], Zion is she [whom] none seeketh after."<p>This strophe is only a fuller expression of the idea set forth in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-11.htm">Jeremiah 30:11</a>, that the Lord certainly chastises Israel, but will not make an end of him. The chastisement has commenced. From the wounds and blows which Israel has received, he lies motionless and helpless, getting neither sympathy nor aid from his lovers. The feminine suffix and the mention of lovers show that the address turns to the daughter of Zion. On the expression &#1488;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; , "it is ill with thy bruise," cf. <a href="/jeremiah/15-18.htm">Jeremiah 15:18</a>. &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1492; &#1502;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;, "bad, incurable is the stroke which thou hast received," as in <a href="/jeremiah/10-19.htm">Jeremiah 10:19</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/14-17.htm">Jeremiah 14:17</a>. &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503; &#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503;, "to execute justice;" cf. <a href="/jeremiah/5-28.htm">Jeremiah 5:28</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/22-16.htm">Jeremiah 22:16</a>. Hitzig well explains the meaning: "thy claims against thy heathen oppressors." &#1500;&#1502;&#1494;&#1493;&#1512;, although connected by the accents with what precedes, does not agree well with &#1491;&#1468;&#1503; &#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1504;&#1498;; for &#1502;&#1494;&#1493;&#1512; has not the meaning which has been attributed to it, of a "bandage," but, as derived from the verb &#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, "to press a wound," signifies the wound that has been pressed together; see on <a href="/hosea/5-13.htm">Hosea 5:13</a>. Neither does the figure of the wound agree with the expression, "there is none to judge thy cause," so that we might, with Umbreit, render the passage, "No one gives thee thy due, in pressing thy wounds;" while, as Graf says, " &#1512;&#1508;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; dissociated from &#1500;&#1502;&#1494;&#1493;&#1512; forms a useless synonym with &#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492;," and in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-11.htm">Jeremiah 46:11</a>, where the thought is repeated, it is separated from the latter word. Accordingly, with Hitzig and Graf, we connect &#1500;&#1502;&#1494;&#1493;&#1512;  into one clause: "for the wound, there is no healing (or medicine)-no plaster." &#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492; is what is laid upon the wound, a plaster. "All thy lovers," i.e., the nations which were once allied with thee (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-20.htm">Jeremiah 22:20</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/22-22.htm">Jeremiah 22:22</a>), do not trouble themselves about thee, because I have smitten thee so heavily on account of the multitude of thy transgressions; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/5-6.htm">Jeremiah 5:6</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/13-22.htm">Jeremiah 13:22</a>. &#1506;&#1510;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468; still depends on the preposition &#1506;&#1500;, which continues its force, but as a conjunction. The idea that the Israelites have richly deserved their sufferings is still more plainly presented in <a href="/jeremiah/30-15.htm">Jeremiah 30:15</a> : "Why criest thou, because thou hast brought this suffering on thee through thy sins?" &#1488;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; also depends on &#1506;&#1500;, which continues to exert its power in the sentence as a conjunction.</body></html>
