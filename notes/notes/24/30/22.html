The proper work and office of Christ, as Mediator, is to draw near unto God, for us, as the High Priest of our profession. His own undertaking, in compliance with his Father's will, and in compassion to fallen man, engaged him. Jesus Christ was, in all this, truly wonderful. They shall be taken again into covenant with the Lord, according to the covenant made with their fathers. I will be your God: it is his good-will to us, which is the summary of that part of the covenant. The wrath of God against the wicked is very terrible, like a whirlwind. The purposes of his wrath, as well as the purposes of his love, will all be fulfilled. God will comfort all that turn to him; but those who approach him must have their hearts engaged to do it with reverence, devotion, and faith. How will they escape who neglect so great salvation?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This is the effect of Messiah's ministry.

For many hundred years the people of the Jews have been called "Loammi" or, "ye are not my people", <a href="/hosea/1-9.htm">Hosea 1:9</a>; but now being converted, the covenant of God's grace shall be renewed, and a fresh manifestation and application of it made unto them; and they partaking of the grace of it, shall appear to be, and shall be, called the people of God, and shall behave as such, and fear and worship the Lord: <p>and I will be your God; will manifest his love to them, bestow his favours upon them, and take them under his care and protection.

He will recompense to his oppressors and spoilers according to their deeds, and will heal his wounds. The enemies of Zion will now meet the fate which they have prepared for Zion. Those who, like rapacious animals, would devour Israel (see on <a href="/jeremiah/2-3.htm">Jeremiah 2:3</a>), shall be devoured, and all his oppressors shall go into captivity; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/22-22.htm">Jeremiah 22:22</a>. The Kethib &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1505;&#1497;&#1498; is the Aramaic form of the participle from  &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1505; for &#1513;&#1473;&#1505;&#1505;; the Qeri substitutes the Hebrew form &#1513;&#1473;&#1505;&#1497;&#1498;, after <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-11.htm">Jeremiah 50:11</a>, <a href="/isaiah/17-14.htm">Isaiah 17:14</a>. &#1506;&#1500;&#1492; &#1488;&#1512;&#1499;&#1492;, to put on a bandage, lay on a plaster. &#1488;&#1512;&#1499;&#1492; signifies, primarily, not a bandage, but, like the Arabic ari&#770;kah (according to Fleischer in Delitzsch on <a href="/isaiah/58-8.htm">Isaiah 58:8</a>), the new skin which forms over a wound as it heals, and (as is shown by the expression of Isaiah, &#1488;&#1512;&#1499;&#1514;&#1498;&#1470;&#1514;&#1468;&#1510;&#1502;&#1495;) proves the healing of the wound. Against the direct transference of the meaning of the word in Arabic to the Hebrew &#1488;&#1512;&#1499;&#1492;, without taking into consideration the passage in Isaiah just referred to, there is the objection that the word is always used in connection with &#1506;&#1500;&#1492;, "to be put on" (cf. <a href="/isaiah/8-22.htm">Isaiah 8:22</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/24-13.htm">2 Chronicles 24:13</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/4-1.htm">Nehemiah 4:1</a>), or &#1492;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492;, "to put on" (here and in <a href="/jeremiah/33-6.htm">Jeremiah 33:6</a>), which is not the proper verb to be used in speaking of the formation of a new skin over a wound after suppuration has ceased. Hence the word in Hebrew seems to have received the derived sense of "a healing-plaster;" this is confirmed by the employment of the word &#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492;, "plaster," in <a href="/jeremiah/30-13.htm">Jeremiah 30:13</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/46-11.htm">Jeremiah 46:11</a>. - The second &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-17.htm">Jeremiah 30:17</a>, is subordinate to the clause which precedes. "Because they called thee one rejected," i.e., because the enemies of Zion spoke of her contemptuously, as a city that has been forsaken of God, and the Lord will heal her wounds. </body></html>
