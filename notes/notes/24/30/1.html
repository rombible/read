From hence the transition was natural and easy to the more glorious and general restoration that was to take place in a more distant period, and was designed for the ultimate object of the national hopes and expectations. Both events are frequently thus connected together in the prophetic writings, and perhaps with this design, that when that which was nearest at hand should be accomplished, it might afford the strongest and most satisfactory evidence that the latter, how remote soever its period, would in like manner, be brought about by the interposition of Providence, in its due season.” — Blaney. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/30.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>30:1-11 Jeremiah is to write what God had spoken to him. The very words are such as the Holy Ghost teaches. These are the words God ordered to be written; and promises written by his order, are truly his word. He must write a description of the trouble the people were now in, and were likely to be in. A happy end should be put to these calamities. Though the afflictions of the church may last long, they shall not last always. The Jews shall be restored again. They shall obey, or hearken to the Messiah, the Christ, the Son of David, their King. The deliverance of the Jews from Babylon, is pointed out in the prophecy, but the restoration and happy state of Israel and Judah, when converted to Christ their King, are foretold; also the miseries of the nations before the coming of Christ. All men must honour the Son as they honour the Father, and come into the service and worship of God by him. Our gracious Lord pardons the sins of the believer, and breaks off the yoke of sin and Satan, that he may serve God without fear, in righteousness and true holiness before him all the remainder of his days, as the redeemed subject of Christ our King.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/30.htm">Jeremiah 30-39</a>, not all written at the same time, are gathered together whatsoever God had revealed to Jeremiah of happier import for the Jewish people. This subject is "the New covenant." In contrast then with the rolls of Jehoiakim and Zedekiah, we here have one containing the nation's hope. A considerable portion was written in the 10th year of Zedekiah, when famine and pestilence were busy in the city, its capture daily more imminent, and the prophet himself in prison. Yet in this sad pressure of earthly troubles Jeremiah could bid his countrymen look courageously onward to the fulfillment of those hopes, which had so constantly in his darkest hours comforted the heart and nerved the arm of the Jew.

Introduction to the section. The standpoint (see above) is that of one writing after the final catastrophe (b.c. 586), but this fact is of course by no means inconsistent with Jeremiah’s authorship. Moreover, the words of comfort that follow harmonize with his commission “to build and to plant” (<a href="/jeremiah/1-10.htm" title="See, I have this day set you over the nations and over the kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to throw down, to build, and to plant.">Jeremiah 1:10</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The greater part of the ch. follows a regular three beat metre or is in the Ḳinah measure.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/29.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Because thou hast sent in thy name (without divine commission) letters to all the people in Jerusalem, and to Sephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, and to all the priests, saying." &#1505;&#1508;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; may be a single letter, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/10-1.htm">2 Kings 10:1-2</a>; but since these were sent to the people, the priest Zephaniah, and all the people, the word doubtless means here letters in the plural. As to Zephaniah ben Maaseiah, see at <a href="/jeremiah/21-1.htm">Jeremiah 21:1</a>. - In <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-26.htm">Jeremiah 29:26-28</a> follows the main substance of the letter: "Jahveh hath set thee to be priest in the stead of the priest Jehoiada, that there should be officers in the house of Jahveh for every man that is mad and prophesieth, that thou shouldest put him in the stocks and in neck-irons. <a href="/jeremiah/29-27.htm">Jeremiah 29:27</a>. And, now, why hast thou not restrained Jeremiah of Anathoth, that prophesieth to you? <a href="/jeremiah/29-28.htm">Jeremiah 29:28</a>. For therefore hath he sent to us to Babylon (a letter) to the effect: It will last long; build houses and dwell (therein), and plant gardens and eat the fruit of them." Zephaniah occupied, acc. to <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-26.htm">Jeremiah 29:26</a>, the post of a chief officer of the temple, was a chief warden, as Pashur had been before him, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-1.htm">Jeremiah 21:1</a>, who had charge of the police regulations of the temple.<p>In the stead of the priest Jehoiada. These words Grot., Hitz., and Gr. refer to the high priest Jehoiada under King Joash, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/11-18.htm">2 Kings 11:18</a>, who set up officers (&#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;) over the temple. But this view cannot be reconciled with the words of the text: "Jahveh hath set thee to be priest in Jehoiada's stead, that there should be officers;" since from these ambiguous words, Zephaniah filled the same post as Jehoiada had done, and was his successor in office. The other well-known Jehoiada was high priest, who appointed officers; Zephaniah, on the other hand was only "the second priest," and as such had charge of the temple arrangements and of public order there. Nor is there any hint here or elsewhere that Zephaniah was the immediate successor of Pashur in this office, nor any indication to make it unlikely that Jehoiada held the post after Pashur and that Zedekiah succeeded him. The plural "officers" is general: that at all times there should be officers. "For every man that is mad an prophesieth." &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1490;&#1468;&#1506;, the deranged or mad person, is here closely associated with &#1502;&#1514;&#1504;&#1489;&#1468;&#1488;, him that bears himself as prophet. The former word is used in the evil sense of the apparently deranged behaviour of the man on whom the Spirit of God has laid hold, <a href="/2_kings/9-11.htm">2 Kings 9:11</a>; <a href="/hosea/9-7.htm">Hosea 9:7</a>. The idea is not: for (or against) every prophet, but: for every madman that plays the prophet. The temple, i.e., the outer court of the temple, was the usual place for prophets to take their stand. Shemaiah accordingly means that it was the duty of the chief warden of the temple to repress attempts to speak in the temple on the part of pretended prophets, by putting such persons in stocks and irons. As to &#1502;&#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1499;&#1514;, see on <a href="/jeremiah/20-2.htm">Jeremiah 20:2</a>. &#1510;&#1497;&#1504;&#1511; is &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0; &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;.. It certainly does not mean prison after &#1510;&#1504;&#1511;, in Samaritan  equals  clausit; but apparently neck-irons after Arab. zna&#770;q, necklace, ring. Since both words are used together here, and since the meaning is apparently that Jeremiah should be put into both instruments at once, Hitz. conjectures that both together were needed to make the stocks complete, but that each had its own proper name, because it was possible to fix in the neck, leaving hands and feet free, or conversely, as in <a href="/jeremiah/20-2.htm">Jeremiah 20:2</a>. -  &#1490;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;, rebuke, check by threats, restrain, cf. <a href="/ruth/2-16.htm">Ruth 2:16</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/malachi/3-11.htm">Malachi 3:11</a>, etc. "For therefore," sc. just because thou hast not restrained him from prophesying he has sent to Babylon. &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495; with &#1500;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; following, send to say, means: to send a message or letter as follows. &#1500;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; &#1488;&#1512;&#1499;&#1492; &#1492;&#1497;&#1488; Hitz. renders: for he thought: it (Babylon) is far away; Jeremiah's meaning being, that in Jerusalem they would know nothing about his letter he was sending to Babylon. But such a hidden purpose is utterly foreign to the character of the prophet. He had publicly predicted in Jerusalem the long seventy years' duration of the exile; and it was not likely to occur to him to wish to make a secret of the letter of like import which he sent to Babylon. Besides, Hitz.'s interpretation is forced. Since there is no &#1500;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; before &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; &#1489;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, the &#1500;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; before &#1488;&#1512;&#1499;&#1492; can only be introductory to the contents of the letter. For &#1488;&#1512;&#1498; used of duration in time, cf. <a href="/2_samuel/3-1.htm">2 Samuel 3:1</a>; <a href="/job/11-9.htm">Job 11:9</a>. "Long-lasting it is," sc. your sojourn in Babylon. These words give the burden of his prophecy, that on which he founded his counsel: build houses, etc.</body></html>
