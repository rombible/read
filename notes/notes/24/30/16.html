Though God chastises his own people with severity, according to the nature and quality of their faults, yet he does it so as never utterly to destroy them. The Assyrians, who afflicted Israel and Judah, were so destroyed by the Babylonians, Medes, and Persians, that mention is no more made of their empire. The monarchy of the Chaldeans, who destroyed Jerusalem, and carried the Jews into captivity, was overthrown by the Persians, and never recovered itself. The empires of the Persians and Egyptians were destroyed by Alexander. The Grecian. or Syro-Macedonian kingdom, which, especially under Antiochus Epiphanes, cruelly persecuted them, was destroyed by the Romans. And the Roman empire, powerful as it was, after being made the instrument of bringing greater calamities on the Jewish nation than they had ever suffered from any other power, was broken to pieces by the incursions of the northern nations on the one hand, and by the Saracens and Turks on the other. But the Jewish people, who have repeatedly appeared to be almost destroyed and annihilated in their dispersions, have reappeared, and sprung up again, as it were, from their ashes, and become as numerous and powerful as before.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/30.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>30:12-17 When God is against a people, who will be for them? Who can be for them, so as to do them any kindness? Incurable griefs are owing to incurable lusts. Yet, though the captives suffered justly, and could not help themselves, the Lord intended to appear for them, and to punish their oppressors; and he will still do so. But every effort to heal ourselves must prove fruitless, so long as we neglect the heavenly Advocate and sanctifying Spirit. The dealings of His grace with every true convert, and every returning backslider, are the same in effect as his proceedings to the Jews.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Therefore - i. e., Because thou hast undergone thy punishment and cried out in consciousness of thy guilt. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/30.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16. Therefore&#8212;connected with Jer 30:13, because "There is none to plead thy cause &#8230; therefore" I will plead thy cause, and heal thy wound, by overwhelming thy foes. This fifteenth verse is inserted to amplify what was said at the close of Jer 30:14. When the false ways of peace, suggested by the so-called prophets, had only ended in the people's irremediable ruin, the true prophet comes forward to announce the grace of God as bestowing repentance and healing.<p>devour thee &#8230; be devoured &#8230; spoil &#8230; be a spoil &#8230; prey upon &#8230; give for a prey&#8212;retribution in kind (see on [938]Jer 2:3; Ex 23:22; Isa 33:1).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/30.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The particle Nbl is thought here to be ill translated <span class="ital">therefore</span>, for manifestly it is not a causal or illative, and those who interpret it therefore refer it to what went before, <span class="bld"><a href="/jeremiah/30-10.htm" title="Therefore fear you not, O my servant Jacob, said the LORD; neither be dismayed, O Israel: for, see, I will save you from afar, and your seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall be in rest, and be quiet, and none shall make him afraid.">Jeremiah 30:10</a>,11</span>.

Jarchi calls it an oath, that so it should be; the Romans that devoured them, and ate up their substance, were devoured by the Goths and Vandals; for this may be carried further than to the destruction of the Babylonish empire by the Persians; <p>and all thine adversaries, everyone of them shall, fro into captivity; or be conquered and subdued, as were the Assyrians, Egyptians, Chaldeans, Grecians, Romans; and not only Rome Pagan has been destroyed, but Rome Papal also will go into captivity; see <a href="/revelation/13-10.htm">Revelation 13:10</a>; <p>and they that spoil thee shall be a spoil, and all that prey upon thee will I give for a prey: they shall be used according to the law of retaliation; the same measure they have measured shall be measured to them again. <p>(y) "verumtamen, vel nihilominus", Gataker.

The only expression which, besides the repetition made in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-27.htm">Jeremiah 46:27</a>, occurs nowhere else in Jeremiah, but frequently in the second Isaiah, is, "my servant Jacob;" cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/44-1.htm">Isaiah 44:1-2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/45-4.htm">Isaiah 45:4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/48-20.htm">Isaiah 48:20</a> and <a href="/isaiah/41-8.htm">Isaiah 41:8</a>; <a href="/isaiah/44-21.htm">Isaiah 44:21</a>; <a href="/isaiah/49-3.htm">Isaiah 49:3</a>.
