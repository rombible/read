Other prophets had, under Ahab or Manasseh, been slain with the sword, but none, so far as we know (with the one exception of Hanani the seer in <a href="/2_chronicles/16-10.htm" title="Then Asa was wroth with the seer, and put him in a prison house; for he was in a rage with him because of this thing. And Asa oppressed some of the people the same time.">2Chronicles 16:10</a>), had ever before been subjected to an ignominious punishment such as this. It was so far analogous to the outrage against which St. Paul protested in <a href="/context/acts/23-2.htm" title="And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth.">Acts 23:2-3</a>. The word “smote” implies a blow struck with the priest’s own hands rather than the infliction of the legal punishment of forty stripes save one (<a href="/deuteronomy/25-3.htm" title="Forty stripes he may give him, and not exceed: lest, if he should exceed, and beat him above these with many stripes, then your brother should seem vile to you.">Deuteronomy 25:3</a>). The English word “stocks” expresses adequately enough the instrument of torture which, like the <span class= "ital">nervus </span>of Roman punishment, kept the body (as in <a href="/acts/16-24.htm" title="Who, having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks.">Acts 16:24</a>) in a crooked and painful position. The word here used occurs in the Hebrew of <a href="/2_chronicles/16-10.htm" title="Then Asa was wroth with the seer, and put him in a prison house; for he was in a rage with him because of this thing. And Asa oppressed some of the people the same time.">2Chronicles 16:10</a>, as above, and in <a href="/jeremiah/29-26.htm" title="The LORD has made you priest in the stead of Jehoiada the priest, that you should be officers in the house of the LORD, for every man that is mad, and makes himself a prophet, that you should put him in prison, and in the stocks.">Jeremiah 29:26</a>, but the A. V. there renders it as “prison-house.” In that humiliating position the prophet was left for the whole night in one of the most conspicuous places of the city, the temple-gate of Benjamin (the <span class= "ital">upper </span>gate) on the northern side of the inner court, probably the higher or northern gate of <a href="/ezekiel/8-3.htm" title="And he put forth the form of an hand, and took me by a lock of my head; and the spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heaven, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the inner gate that looks toward the north; where was the seat of the image of jealousy, which provokes to jealousy.">Ezekiel 8:3</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/8-5.htm" title="Then said he to me, Son of man, lift up your eyes now the way toward the north.

The wicked are in great fear where no fear is, for God can make the most daring sinner a terror to himself.

Either with his fist, or with a rod, while he was prophesying, to stop his mouth, and hinder him from going on, and to show his resentment, and influence, the people not to believe him; or he ordered him to be smitten and scourged by some inferior officer. This was very ill treatment of a prophet, a prophet of the Lord, and one that was a priest too, of the same order with himself; <p>and put him in the stocks; or ordered him to be put there; but whether it was such an engine or instrument as we call "stocks", in which the feet of prisoners are put, is not certain. Kimchi's father says, it was an instrument made of two pieces of wood, in which the necks of prisoners were put; and some say it had besides two holes for the two hands to be put in; and so the same with our "pillory".

The first series, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-6.htm">Jeremiah 19:6-9</a>, is introduced by &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;, which intimates the meaning of the pitcher; and the other, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-10.htm">Jeremiah 19:10-13</a>, is bound up with the breaking of the pitcher. But both series are, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-6.htm">Jeremiah 19:6</a>, opened by the mention of the locality of the act. As <a href="/jeremiah/19-5.htm">Jeremiah 19:5</a> was but an expansion of <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-31.htm">Jeremiah 7:31</a>, so <a href="/jeremiah/19-6.htm">Jeremiah 19:6</a> is a literal repetition of <a href="/jeremiah/7-32.htm">Jeremiah 7:32</a>. The valley of Benhinnom, with its places for abominable sacrifices (&#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1514;, see on <a href="/jeremiah/7-32.htm">Jeremiah 7:32</a>), shall in the future be called Valley of Slaughter; i.e., at the judgment on Jerusalem it will be the place where the inhabitants of Jerusalem and Judah will be slain by the enemy. There God will make void (&#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;, playing on &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1489;&#1468;&#1511;), i.e., bring to nothing; for what is poured out comes to nothing; cf. <a href="/isaiah/19-3.htm">Isaiah 19:3</a>. There they shall fall by the sword in such numbers that their corpses shall be food for the beasts of prey (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/7-33.htm">Jeremiah 7:33</a>), and the city of Jerusalem shall be frightfully ravaged (<a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-8.htm">Jeremiah 19:8</a>, cf. <a href="/jeremiah/18-16.htm">Jeremiah 18:16</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-9.htm">Jeremiah 25:9</a>, etc.). &#1502;&#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1492; (plural form of suffix without Jod; cf. Ew. 258, a), the wounds she has received. - In <a href="/jeremiah/19-9.htm">Jeremiah 19:9</a> is added yet another item to complete the awful picture, the terrible famine during the siege, partly taken from the words of <a href="/deuteronomy/28-53.htm">Deuteronomy 28:53</a>. and <a href="/leviticus/26-29.htm">Leviticus 26:29</a>. That this appalling misery did actually come about during the last siege by the Chaldeans, we learn from <a href="/lamentations/4-10.htm">Lamentations 4:10</a>. - The second series, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-10.htm">Jeremiah 19:10-13</a>, is introduced by the act of breaking the pitcher. This happens before the eyes of the elders who have accompanied Jeremiah thither: to them the explanatory word of the Lord is addressed. As the earthen pitcher, so shall Jerusalem - people and city - be broken to pieces; and that irremediably. This is implied in: as one breaks a potter's vessel, etc. (&#1492;&#1512;&#1508;&#1492; for &#1492;&#1512;&#1508;&#1488;). The next clause: and in Tophet they shall bury, etc., is omitted by the lxx as a repetition from <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-32.htm">Jeremiah 7:32</a>, and is object to by Ew., Hitz., and Graf, as not being in keeping with its context. Ew. proposes to insert it before "as one breaketh;" but this transposition only obscures the meaning of the clause. It connects very suitably with the idea of the incurable breaking in sunder. Because the breaking up of Jerusalem and its inhabitants shall be incurable, shall be like the breaking of a pitcher dashed into countless fragments, therefore there will be lack of room in Jerusalem to bury the dead, and the unclean places of Tophet will need to be used for that purpose. With this the further thought of <a href="/jeremiah/19-12.htm">Jeremiah 19:12</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/19-13.htm">Jeremiah 19:13</a> connects simply and suitably. Thus (as had been said at <a href="/jeremiah/19-11.htm">Jeremiah 19:11</a>) will I do unto this place and its inhabitants, &#1493;&#1500;&#1514;&#1514;, and that to make the city as Tophet, i.e., not "a mass of sherds and rubbish, as Tophet now is" (Graf); for neither was Tophet then a rubbish-heap, nor did it so become by the breaking of the pitcher. But Josiah had turned all the place of Tophet in the valley of Benhinnom into an unclean region (<a href="/2_kings/23-10.htm">2 Kings 23:10</a>). All Jerusalem shall become an unclean place like Tophet. This is put in so many words in <a href="/jeremiah/19-13.htm">Jeremiah 19:13</a> : The houses of Jerusalem shall become unclean like the place Tophet, namely, all houses on whose roofs idolatry has been practised. The construction of &#1492;&#1496;&#1468;&#1502;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; causes some difficulty. The position of the word at the end disfavours our connecting it with the subject &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, and so does the article, which does not countenance its being taken as predicate. To get rid of the article, J. D. Mich. and Ew. sought to change the reading into &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; &#1496;&#1502;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501;, after <a href="/isaiah/30-33.htm">Isaiah 30:33</a>. But &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;  means a Tophet-like place, not Tophet itself, and so gives no meaning to the purpose. No other course is open than to join the word with "the place Tophet:" like the place Tophet, which is unclean. The plural would then be explained less from the collective force of &#1502;&#1511;&#1493;&#1501; than from regard to the plural subject. "All the houses" opens a supplementary definition of the subject: as concerning all houses; cf. Ew. 310, a. On the worship of the stars by sacrifice on the housetops, transplanted by Manasseh to Jerusalem, see the expos. of <a href="/zephaniah/1-5.htm">Zephaniah 1:5</a> and <a href="/2_kings/21-3.htm">2 Kings 21:3</a>. '&#1493;&#1492;&#1505;&#1468;&#1498;, coinciding literally with <a href="/jeremiah/7-18.htm">Jeremiah 7:18</a>; the inf. absol. being attached to the verb. finit. of the former clause (Ew. 351, c.). - Thus far the word of the Lord to Jeremiah, which he was to proclaim in the valley of Benhinnom. - The execution of the divine commission is, as being a matter of course, not expressly recounted, but is implied in <a href="/jeremiah/19-14.htm">Jeremiah 19:14</a> as having taken place. </body></html>
