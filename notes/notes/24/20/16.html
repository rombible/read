While we remember that these wishes are not recorded for us to utter the like, we may learn good lessons from them. See how much those who think they stand, ought to take heed lest they fall, and to pray daily, Lead us not into temptation. How frail, changeable, and sinful is man!

It is, so to speak, the "technical term" for the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah which Jeremiah employs. So deeply imprinted was the tradition on the Hebrew mind, that a special word was appropriated to it, which at once called up thoughts of the awful justice of God (see <a href="/genesis/19-25.htm">Genesis 19:25</a>; <a href="/isaiah/1-7.htm">Isaiah 1:7</a> (?); 13:19; <a href="/amos/4-11.htm">Amos 4:11</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/29-23.htm">Deuteronomy 29:23</a> [22]; <a href="/jeremiah/49-18.htm">Jeremiah 49:18</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/50-40.htm">Jeremiah 50:40</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The cry... the shouting.</span> The cry of the besieged for help; the shouting of the suddenly appearing assailants (comp. <a href="/jeremiah/15-8.htm">Jeremiah 15:8</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/20.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div><a href="/jeremiah/20-10.htm">Jeremiah 20:10</a> gives the reason for the resolution, adopted but not carried out, of speaking no more in the name of the Lord. This was found in the reports that reached his ears of schemes against his life. The first clause is a verbal quotation from <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/31-14.htm">Psalm 31:14</a>, a lament of David in the time of Saul's persecutions. &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492;, base, backbiting slander. The phrase: Fear round about, indicates, in the form of a brief popular saying, the dangerous case in which the prophet was,<p>(Note: Hupfeld on <a href="/psalms/31-14.htm">Psalm 31:14</a> holds &#1502;&#1490;&#1493;&#1512; &#1502;&#1505;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489; to be a proverbial expression for a harassed condition, full of terrors, since the phrase is frequently used by Jeremiah (besides the present <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-3.htm">Jeremiah 20:3</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-4.htm">Jeremiah 20:4</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-15.htm">Jeremiah 20:15</a>, it is at <a href="/jeremiah/6-25.htm">Jeremiah 6:25</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/46-5.htm">Jeremiah 46:5</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/49-29.htm">Jeremiah 49:29</a>; <a href="/lamentations/2-22.htm">Lamentations 2:22</a>). The use made of it in v. 3 would in that case be easily understood. For we cannot infer, as Ng. would do, that Jeremiah must have formed the phrase himself, from the fact that, except in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/31-14.htm">Psalm 31:14</a>, it is nowhere found but in Jeremiah.)<p>which his adversaries prepare for him by their repeating: Report him, we will report him.<p>Report: here, report to the authorities as a dangerous man. Even those who are on friendly terms with him lie in wait for his fall. This phrase too is formed of phrases from the Psalms. On "am of my peace," cf. <a href="/psalms/41-10.htm">Psalm 41:10</a>; on &#1510;&#1500;&#1506;&#1497;, <a href="/psalms/35-15.htm">Psalm 35:15</a>; <a href="/psalms/38-18.htm">Psalm 38:18</a>; and on &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;, watch, lie in wait for, <a href="/psalms/56-7.htm">Psalm 56:7</a>; <a href="/psalms/71-10.htm">Psalm 71:10</a>. "Peradventure" - so they said - "he may let himself be enticed," sc. to say something on which a capital charge may be founded (Graf). With "that we may prevail against him," cf. <a href="/jeremiah/1-19.htm">Jeremiah 1:19</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/15-20.htm">Jeremiah 15:20</a>. - At <a href="/jeremiah/20-11.htm">Jeremiah 20:11</a> the lament rises into confidence in the Lord, springing from the promise given to him by God at his call. &#1488;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497; (for &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;) &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; recalls <a href="/jeremiah/1-19.htm">Jeremiah 1:19</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/15-20.htm">Jeremiah 15:20</a>.The designation of God as &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512; is formed after <a href="/jeremiah/15-21.htm">Jeremiah 15:21</a>. Because the Lord has promised to deliver him out of the hand of the &#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501;, violent, he now calls him a hero using violence, and on this founds his assurance that his persecutors will accomplish nothing, but will come to a downfall, to shame, and be covered with never-dying, never-to-be-forgotten disgrace. Because they have dealt not wisely, i.e., foolishly, see on <a href="/jeremiah/10-21.htm">Jeremiah 10:21</a>; not: because they did not prosper, which would give a weak, superfluous idea, since their not prospering lies already in &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;, spe frustrari. This disgrace will befall the persecutors, because the Lord of hosts will, as Searcher of hearts, take the part of the righteous, and will take vengeance on their foes. This is the force of <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-12.htm">Jeremiah 20:12</a>, which, with a few changes, is repeated from <a href="/jeremiah/11-20.htm">Jeremiah 11:20</a>. - In this trustfulness his soul rises to a firm hope of deliverance, so that in <a href="/jeremiah/20-13.htm">Jeremiah 20:13</a> he can call on himself and all the godly to praise God, the Saviour of the poor.
