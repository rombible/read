But ver. 7 may be read, Thou hast persuaded me, and I was persuaded. Thou wast stronger than I; and didst overpower me by the influence of thy Spirit upon me. So long as we see ourselves in the way of God, and of duty, it is weakness and folly, when we meet with difficulties and discouragements, to wish we had never set out in it. The prophet found the grace of God mighty in him to keep him to his business, notwithstanding the temptation he was in to throw it up. Whatever injuries are done to us, we must leave them to that God to whom vengeance belongs, and who has said, I will repay. So full was he of the comfort of God's presence, the Divine protection he was under, and the Divine promise he had to depend upon, that he stirred up himself and others to give God the glory.

If we take it in the latter sense, it teacheth us our duty, to give God the honour of all our deliverances from the hands of wicked men.

The prophet, from prayer, proceeds to praise; and from expressions of faith and confidence in the Lord, having committed his cause to him, being assured of success, rises up to a holy triumph and joy; and calls upon his soul, and upon others, to join with him in praising, and singing praises to the Lord: this is said, as Kimchi observes, with respect to the saints in Jerusalem; for there were some good people doubtless there at this time, a remnant according to the election of grace; who had a regard for the prophet, and wished well to him, and were ready to join with him in acts of devotion, prayer, or praise; <p>for he hath delivered the soul of the poor from the hand of evil doers; or, "the life of the poor"; meaning himself, a poor destitute person, few or none to stand by him but the Lord, who had delivered him out of the hand of Pashur and his accomplices; and out of the hand of those that watched for his halting; and out of the hands of all his persecutors: or this may respect not past deliverances, but what was to come; which the prophet had such a believing view of, that he calls upon himself and others to praise God for beforehand. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/20.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Sing unto the LORD, praise ye the LORD: for he hath delivered the soul of the poor from the hand of evildoers.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/20.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">13</span>.

The first complaint runs thus:<p><a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-7.htm">Jeremiah 20:7-13</a><p>"Thou hast persuaded me, Jahveh, and I let myself be persuaded; Thou hast laid hold on me and hast prevailed. I am become a laughter the whole day long, every one mocketh at me. <a href="/jeremiah/20-8.htm">Jeremiah 20:8</a>. For as often as I speak, I must call out and cry violence and spoil, for the word of Jahveh is made a reproach and a derision to me all the day. <a href="/jeremiah/20-9.htm">Jeremiah 20:9</a>. And I said, I will not more remember nor speak more in His name; then was it in my heart as burning fire, shut up in my bones, and I become weary of holding out, and cannot. <a href="/jeremiah/20-10.htm">Jeremiah 20:10</a>. For I heard the talk of many: Fear round about! Report, and let us report him! Every man of my friendship lies in wait for my downfall: Peradventure he will let himself be enticed, that we may prevail against him and take our revenge on him. <a href="/jeremiah/20-11.htm">Jeremiah 20:11</a>. But Jahveh stands by me as a mighty warrior; therefore shall my persecutors stumble and not prevail, shall be greatly put to shame, because they have not dealt wisely, with everlasting disgrace which will not be forgotten. <a href="/jeremiah/20-12.htm">Jeremiah 20:12</a>. And, Jahveh of hosts that trieth the righteous, that seeth reins and heart, let me see Thy vengeance on them, for to Thee have I committed my cause. <a href="/jeremiah/20-13.htm">Jeremiah 20:13</a>. Sing to Jahveh, praise Jahveh, for He saves the soul of the poor from the hand of the evil-doers."<p>This lament as to the hatred and persecution brought upon him by the preaching of the word of the Lord, is chiefly called forth by the proceedings, recounted in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-1.htm">Jeremiah 20:1</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-2.htm">Jeremiah 20:2</a>, of the temple-warden Pashur against him. This is clear from the &#1502;&#1490;&#1493;&#1512; ; for, as N&#1492;g. truly remarks, the use of this expression against the prophet may certainly be most easily explained by the use he had so pregnantly made of it against one so distinguished as Pashur. Besides, the bitterness of the complaint, rising at last to the extent of cursing the day of his birth (<a href="/jeremiah/20-14.htm">Jeremiah 20:14</a>.), is only intelligible as a consequence of such ill-usage as Pashur had already inflicted on him. For although his enemies had schemed against his life, they had never yet ventured positively to lay hands on his person. Pashur first caused him to be beaten, and then had him kept a whole night long in the torture of the stocks. From torture like this his enemies might proceed even to taking his life, if the Lord did not miraculously shield him from their vengeance. - The complaint, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-7.htm">Jeremiah 20:7-13</a>, is an outpouring of the heart to God, a prayer that begins with complaint, passes into confidence in the Lord's protection, and ends in a triumph of hope. In <a href="/jeremiah/20-7.htm">Jeremiah 20:7</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/20-8.htm">Jeremiah 20:8</a> Jeremiah complains of the evil consequences of his labours. God has persuaded him to undertake the office of prophet, so that he has yielded to the call of God. The words of <a href="/jeremiah/20-7.htm">Jeremiah 20:7</a> are not an upbraiding, nor are they given in an upbraiding tone (Hitz.); for &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; does not mean befool, but persuade, induce by words to do a thing. &#1495;&#1494;&#1511; used transitively, but not as <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/16-22.htm">1 Kings 16:22</a>, overpower (Ros., Graf, etc.); for then it would not be in keeping with the following &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;, which after "overpower" would seem very feeble. It means: lay hold of; as usually in the Hiph., so here in Kal. It thus corresponds to &#1495;&#1494;&#1511;&#1514; &#1497;&#1491;, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/8-11.htm">Isaiah 8:11</a>, denoting the state of being laid hold of by the power of the Spirit of God in order to prophesy. &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;, not: Thou hast been able, but: Thou hast prevailed, conquered. A sharp contrast to this is presented by the issue of his prophetic labours: I am become a laughing-stock all the day, i.e., incessantly. &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;, its (the people's) entirety  equals  all the people. - In <a href="/jeremiah/20-8.htm">Jeremiah 20:8</a> "call" is explained by "cry out violence and spoil:" complain of the violence and spoliation that are practised. The word of Jahveh is become a reproach and obloquy, i.e., the proclamation of it has brought him only contempt and obloquy. The two cases of &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; are co-ordinate; the two clauses give two reasons for everybody mocking at him. One is objective: so often as he speaks he can do nothing but complain of violence, so that he is ridiculed by the mass of the people; and one is subjective: his preaching brings him only disgrace. Most comm. refer "violence and spoiling" to the ill-usage the prophet experiences; but this does not exhaust the reference of the words.</body></html>
