Jeremiah was silent till God put a word into his mouth. To confirm this, Pashur has a name given him, Fear on every side. It speaks a man not only in distress, but in despair; not only in danger, but in fear on every side. The wicked are in great fear where no fear is, for God can make the most daring sinner a terror to himself. And those who will not hear of their faults from God's prophets, shall be made to hear them from their consciences. Miserable is the man thus made a terror to himself. His friends shall fail him.

When Jeremiah, having performed the divine command, returned from Tophet to the city, he went into the court of the house of God and spoke to the people assembled there, v. 15: "Thus hath said Jahveh of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I bring upon this city, and all its cities, all the evil that I have pronounced against it, because they stiffened their necks not to hear my words." "All the people" is the people present in the court of the temple as distinguished from the men who had accompanied Jeremiah into the valley of Benhinnom (<a href="/jeremiah/19-10.htm">Jeremiah 19:10</a>). &#1502;&#1489;&#1497;, the &#1488; having dropped off, as in <a href="/jeremiah/39-16.htm">Jeremiah 39:16</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/21-21.htm">1 Kings 21:21</a>, <a href="/1_kings/21-29.htm">1 Kings 21:29</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-2.htm">2 Samuel 5:2</a>, and often. "All its cities" are the towns that belonged to Jerusalem, were subject to it (<a href="/jeremiah/34-1.htm">Jeremiah 34:1</a>); in other words, the cities of Judah, <a href="/jeremiah/1-15.htm">Jeremiah 1:15</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-10.htm">Jeremiah 9:10</a>, etc. All the evil that I have pronounced against it, not merely in the valley of Benhinnom (<a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-3.htm">Jeremiah 19:3-13</a>), but generally up till this time, by the mouth of Jeremiah. If we limit the reference of this view to the prophecy in Tophet, we must assume, with Ng., that Jeremiah repeated the substance of it here; and besides, that prophecy is not in keeping with "all its cities," inasmuch as it (<a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-3.htm">Jeremiah 19:3-13</a>) deals with Jerusalem alone. Apparently Jeremiah must have said more than is written in the verse, and described the evil somewhat more closely; so that the new matter spoken by him here consists in the "Behold I bring," etc., i.e., in his forewarning them of the speedy fulfilment of the threatenings against Jerusalem and Judah, as was the case with the prophecy in the valley of Benhinnom, which also, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-3.htm">Jeremiah 19:3</a>, begins with &#1492;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497; &#1502;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488;. On "they stiffened their necks," etc., cf. <a href="/jeremiah/17-23.htm">Jeremiah 17:23</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/7-26.htm">Jeremiah 7:26</a>. </body></html>
