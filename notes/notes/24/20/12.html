But ver. 7 may be read, Thou hast persuaded me, and I was persuaded. Thou wast stronger than I; and didst overpower me by the influence of thy Spirit upon me. So long as we see ourselves in the way of God, and of duty, it is weakness and folly, when we meet with difficulties and discouragements, to wish we had never set out in it. The prophet found the grace of God mighty in him to keep him to his business, notwithstanding the temptation he was in to throw it up. Whatever injuries are done to us, we must leave them to that God to whom vengeance belongs, and who has said, I will repay. So full was he of the comfort of God's presence, the Divine protection he was under, and the Divine promise he had to depend upon, that he stirred up himself and others to give God the glory. Let the people of God open their cause before Him, and he will enable them to see deliverance.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This verse is repeated almost verbatim from <a href="/jeremiah/11-20.htm">Jeremiah 11:20</a>.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/20.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. triest the righteous&#8212;in latent contrast to the hasty judgments of men (Jer 11:20; 17:10).<p>opened&#8212;that is, committed (compare 2Ki 19:14; Ps 35:1).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/20.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Seest the reins and the heart:</span> the prophet had, <span class="bld"><a href="/jeremiah/17-10.htm" title="I the LORD search the heart, I try the reins, even to give every man according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings.">Jeremiah 17:10</a></span>, spoken unto God under this notion; here he appealeth to him as such, who therefore must needs see as well the prophet’s sincerity as his enemies’ malice. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Let me see thy vengeance on them:</span> for his prayer against his enemies, it is of the same nature with what we met with <span class="bld"><a href="/jeremiah/11-20.htm" title="But, O LORD of hosts, that judge righteously, that try the reins and the heart, let me see your vengeance on them: for to you have I revealed my cause.">Jeremiah 11:20</a></span>, indeed this whole verse is the same with that.

But yet the prophet seems in this petition to have showed himself a man (as the apostle speaks of Elijah) subject to like passions with other men; for although God sometimes by his providence causeth vengeance to come upon his and his people’s enemies in their sight, yet whether they may absolutely pray for it is a question. <span class="bld">See Poole "<a href="/jeremiah/11-20.htm" title="But, O LORD of hosts, that judge righteously, that try the reins and the heart, let me see your vengeance on them: for to you have I revealed my cause.">Jeremiah 11:20</a>"</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/20.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But, O Lord, that triest the righteous, and seest the reins and the heart,....

"For thus hath Jahveh said: Behold, I make thee a terror to thyself and to all thy friends, and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies and thine eyes behold it; and all Judah will I give into the hand of the king of Babylon, that he may carry them captive to Babylon and smite them with the sword. <a href="/jeremiah/20-5.htm">Jeremiah 20:5</a>. And I will give all the stores of this city, and all its gains, and all its splendour, and all the treasures of the kings of Judah will I give into the hand of their enemies, who shall plunder them and take and bring them to Babylon. <a href="/jeremiah/20-6.htm">Jeremiah 20:6</a>. And thou, Pashur, and all that dwell in thine house shall go into captivity, and to Babylon shalt thou come, and there die, and there be buried, thou and all thy friends, to whom thou hast prophesied lyingly." - Pashur will become a fear or terror to himself and all his friends, because of his own and his friend's fate; for he will see his friends fall by the sword of the enemy, and then he himself, with those of his house and his friends not as yet slain, will go forth into exile to Babylon and die there. So that not to himself merely, but to all about him, he will be an object of fear. Ng. wrongly translates &#1504;&#1514;&#1504;&#1498; &#1500;&#1502;&#1490;&#1493;&#1512;, I deliver thee up to fear, and brings into the text the contrast that Pashur is not to become the victim of death itself, but of perpetual fear of death. Along with Pashur's friends, all Judah is to be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and be partly exiled to Babylon, partly put to death with the sword. All the goods and gear of Jerusalem, together with the king's treasures, are to be plundered and carried off by the enemy. We must not press "all thy friends" in <a href="/jeremiah/20-4.htm">Jeremiah 20:4</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/20-6.htm">Jeremiah 20:6</a>; and so we escape the apparent contradiction, that while in <a href="/jeremiah/20-4.htm">Jeremiah 20:4</a> it is said of all the friends that they shall die by the sword, it is said of all in <a href="/jeremiah/20-6.htm">Jeremiah 20:6</a> that they shall go into exile. The friends are those who take Pashur's side, his partisans. From the last clause of <a href="/jeremiah/20-6.htm">Jeremiah 20:6</a> we see that Pashur was also of the number of the false prophets, who prophesied the verse of Jeremiah's prediction, namely, welfare and peace (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/23-17.htm">Jeremiah 23:17</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/14-13.htm">Jeremiah 14:13</a>). - This saying of Jeremiah was most probably fulfilled at the taking of Jerusalem under Jechoniah, Pashur and the better part of the people being carried off to Babylon. </body></html>
