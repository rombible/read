Nothing could show the acuteness of the prophet’s sufferings more vividly than the precautions which the thoughtful kindness of the Eunuch thus suggested. The pit was so deep that ropes were needed to draw him up, as they had been to let him down, and lest they should cut into the flesh of Jeremiah’s emaciated form, improvised cushions had to be fastened to the ropes, that he might rest his arm-pits on them. He was, however, at last rescued, and re-instated in his former position, as a prisoner under the king’s protection.<p>“Clout” in old English was used for a patch of cloth as distinct from the “rags,” which were of linen.

The princes went on in their malice. It is common for wicked people to look upon God's faithful ministers as enemies, because they show what enemies the wicked are to themselves while impenitent. Jeremiah was put into a dungeon. Many of God's faithful witnesses have been privately made away in prisons. Ebed-melech was an Ethiopian; yet he spoke to the king faithfully, These men have done ill in all they have done to Jeremiah. See how God can raise up friends for his people in distress. Orders were given for the prophet's release, and Ebed-melech saw him drawn up. Let this encourage us to appear boldly for God. Special notice is taken of his tenderness for Jeremiah. What do we behold in the different characters then, but the same we behold in the different characters now, that the Lord's children are conformed to his example, and the children of Satan to their master?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/38.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Old cast clouts ... - Rags of torn garments and rags of worn-out garments. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/38.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. cast clouts&#8212;"torn clothes" [Henderson].<p>rotten rags&#8212;"worn-out garments."

This reply indicates not merely the weakness and powerlessness of the king against his princes, but also his inward aversion to the testimony of the man of God. "That he would like to save him, just as he afterwards does (<a href="/jeremiah/38-10.htm">Jeremiah 38:10</a>)," is not implied in what he says, with which he delivers up the prophet to the spite of his enemies. Though the princes had at once put Jeremiah to death, the king would not even have been able to reproach them. The want of courage vigorously to oppose the demand of the princes did not spring from any kindly feeling towards the prophet, but partly from moral weakness of character, partly from inward repugnance to the word of God proclaimed by Jeremiah.

Ewald, 321, a. &#1488;&#1514;&#1499;&#1501; is certainly in form an accusative; but it cannot be such, since &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; follows as the accusative: it is therefore either to be pointed &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1499;&#1501; or to be considered as standing for it, just as &#1488;&#1493;&#1514;&#1498; often occurs for &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1498;, "with," i.e., "along with you."</body></html>
