This statement was true, though not the whole truth; the princes had no right to the information; no sanction is given by Scripture here to Jeremiah's representation of this being the cause of his having come to the king. Fear drove him to it.

Here the king puts words into the prophet's mouth, what he should say to the princes, to put them off from inquiring further, and so keep the matter a secret: <p>I presented my supplication before the king; or "caused it to fall" (d); delivered it in an humble and submissive manner: <p>that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan's house, to die there; this he had entreated of the king before, <a href="/jeremiah/37-20.htm">Jeremiah 37:20</a>; and now, no doubt, renewed his request, having this fair opportunity with the king alone to do it; or, however, it is highly probable he did it upon this hint of the king. This shows how much the king stood in fear of his princes in this time of his distress; and that he had only the name of a king, and had not courage and resolution enough to act of himself, according to the dictates of his mind; yea, that he feared men more than he feared the Lord. <p>(d)   "cadere feci deprecationem meam", Pagninus; "cadere faciens fui", &amp;c.

Yet, pray, listen to the voice of Jahveh, in that which I say to thee, that it may be well with thee, and that thy soul may live. <a href="/jeremiah/38-21.htm">Jeremiah 38:21</a>. But if thou dost refuse to go out i.e., to surrender thyself to the Chaldeans, this is the word which the Lord hath shown me has revealed to me: <a href="/jeremiah/38-22.htm">Jeremiah 38:22</a>. Behold, all the women that are left in the house of the king of Judah shall be brought out to the princes of the king of Babylon, and those [women] shall say, Thy friends have misled thee and have overcome thee; thy feet are sunk in the mud, they have turned away back. <a href="/jeremiah/38-23.htm">Jeremiah 38:23</a>. And all thy wives and thy children shall they bring out to the Chaldeans, and thou shalt not escape out of their hand; for thou shalt be seized by the hand of the king of Babylon, and thou shalt burn this city with fire." - After Jeremiah had once more assured the king that he would save his life by voluntary surrender, he announces to him that, on the other alternative, instead of his becoming the sport of the deserters, the women of his harem would be insulted. The women who remain in the king's house, as distinguished from "thy wives" (<a href="/jeremiah/38-23.htm">Jeremiah 38:23</a>), are the women of the royal harem, the wives of former kings, who remain in the harem as the concubines of the reigning king. These are to be brought out to the generals of the Chaldean king, and to sing a satire on him, to this effect: "Thy friends have misled thee, and overpowered thee," etc. The first sentence of this song is from <a href="//biblehub.com/obadiah/1-7.htm">Obadiah 1:7</a>, where &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1497;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498; ere stands instead of &#1492;&#1505;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498;.

Through their counsels, these have led him astray, and brought him into a bog, in which his feet stick fast, and then they have gone back; i.e., instead of helping him out, they have deserted him, leaving him sticking in the bog. The expression is figurative, and the meaning of the figure is plain (&#1512;&#1490;&#1500;&#1498; is plural). &#1489;&#1468;&#1509;, &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0; &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;.., is equivalent to &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1468;&#1492;, a bog, <a href="/job/8-11.htm">Job 8:11</a>.
