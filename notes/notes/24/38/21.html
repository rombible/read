And thus shall a greater evil come upon thee than that which thou fearest, and the fear of which makes the unwilling to comply with the will of God concerning thee. <span class="ital">So shall they bring out all thy wives, </span>&c. — The prophet partly repeats and partly enlarges on the argument advanced in the former verse, with a view to prevail on the king to surrender himself to the Chaldeans. He urges, that if he would not do it, not only himself but his wives and children also would fall into his enemies’ hands, and that their reflection upon him, for the misery he had brought upon them and his country, would be no small aggravation of his affliction.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/38.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>38:14-28 Jeremiah was not forward to repeat the warnings, which seemed only to endanger his own life, and to add to the king's guilt, but asked whether he feared to do the will of God.

King Zedekiah was desirous of once more hearing a message of God from the prophet, and for this object had him brought into the third entrance in the house of the Lord. Nothing further is known about the situation and the nature of this entrance; possibly it led from the palace to the temple, and seems to have been an enclosed space, for the king could carry on a private conversation there with the prophet. The king said to him, "I ask you about a matter, do not conceal anything from me." He meant a message from God regarding the final issue of the siege, cf. <a href="/jeremiah/37-7.htm">Jeremiah 37:7</a>. Jeremiah, knowing the aversion of the king to the truth, replies, <a href="/jeremiah/38-15.htm">Jeremiah 38:15</a> : "If I tell thee [sc. the word of the Lord], wilt thou not assuredly kill me? And if I were to give thee advice, thou wouldst not listen to me." <a href="/jeremiah/38-16.htm">Jeremiah 38:16</a>. Then the king sware to him secretly, "As Jahveh liveth, who hath made us this soul, I shall certainly not kill thee, nor deliver thee into the hand of these men who seek thy life." &#1488;&#1514; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-8.htm">Jeremiah 27:8</a>, properly means, "with regard to Him who has created us." The Qeri expunges &#1488;&#1514;. "These men" are the princes mentioned in <a href="/jeremiah/38-1.htm">Jeremiah 38:1</a>. </body></html>
