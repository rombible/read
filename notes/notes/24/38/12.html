The princes went on in their malice. It is common for wicked people to look upon God's faithful ministers as enemies, because they show what enemies the wicked are to themselves while impenitent. Jeremiah was put into a dungeon. Many of God's faithful witnesses have been privately made away in prisons. Ebed-melech was an Ethiopian; yet he spoke to the king faithfully, These men have done ill in all they have done to Jeremiah. See how God can raise up friends for his people in distress. Orders were given for the prophet's release, and Ebed-melech saw him drawn up. Let this encourage us to appear boldly for God. Special notice is taken of his tenderness for Jeremiah. What do we behold in the different characters then, but the same we behold in the different characters now, that the Lord's children are conformed to his example, and the children of Satan to their master?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/38.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Old cast clouts ... - Rags of torn garments and rags of worn-out garments. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/38.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. cast clouts&#8212;"torn clothes" [Henderson].<p>rotten rags&#8212;"worn-out garments."

The act is first mentioned in a general way in the words, "they cast him into the pit;" then the mode of proceeding is particularized in the words, "and they let him down," etc. On the expression &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512; &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;, "the pit of Malchiah," cf. Ewald, 290, d: the article stands here before the nomen regens, because the nomen rectum, from being a proper name, cannot take it; and yet the pit must be pointed out as one well known and definite. That it was very deep, and that Jeremiah must have perished in it if he were not soon taken out again, is evident from the very fact that they were obliged to use ropes in letting him down, and still more so from the trouble caused in pulling him out (<a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-10.htm">Jeremiah 38:10-12</a>). That the princes did not at once put the prophet to death with the sword was not owing to any feeling of respect for the king, because the latter had not pronounced sentence of death on him, but because they sought to put the prophet to a final death, and yet at the same time wished to silence the voice of conscience with the excuse that they had not shed his blood.</body></html>
