In the “helper that remaineth” we have probably a reference to the foreign mercenaries, especially the Philistines, employed by the two great commercial cities. “Caphtor” has been identified with Crete, Cyprus, Caria, Cappadocia, and the delta of the Nile.

The Philistines are said to have been delivered by God from Caphtor (Am 9:7). Perhaps before the time of Moses they dwelt near and were subjugated by the Caphtorim (De 2:23) and subsequently delivered. "The remnant" means here those still left after the Egyptians had attacked Gaza and Palestine; or rather, those left of the Caphtorim after the Chaldeans had attacked them previous to their attack on the Philistines. Some identify Caphtor with Cappadocia; Gesenius, with Crete (Eze 25:16, Cherethims); Kitto, Cyprus. Between Palestine and Idumea there was a city Caparorsa; and their close connection with Palestine on the one hand, and Egypt (Mizraim, Ge 10:13, 14) on the other hand, makes this locality the most likely.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/47.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Because of the day that cometh to spoil all the Philistines; </span> the day which God hath set and appointed for the ruin of the Philistines.

Properly speaking, it is a poetic synonym for "land,"  and is generally applied to distant and (accidentally) maritime countries. "Caphtor" was understood by the old versions to be Cappadocia. But as the remains of the Cappadocian language point to a Persian origin of the population which spoke it, and as the Caphtorim originally came from Egypt, it is more plausible to suppose, with Ebers, that Caphtor was a coast district of North Egypt. Crete has also been thought of (comp. <a href="/amos/9-7.htm">Amos 9:7</a>; <a href="/genesis/10-14.htm">Genesis 10:14</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/2-23.htm">Deuteronomy 2:23</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/46.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In <a href="/jeremiah/46-24.htm">Jeremiah 46:24</a>. the result of the overthrow of Egypt, which has hitherto been set forth in figurative language, is stated in words which describe the exact realities: Egypt will be given up to ignominy, delivered into the power of a people from the north, i.e., the Chaldeans. The Lord of hosts, the Almighty God of Israel, punishes it for its sins. He visits, i.e., punishes, Amon of No, the chief idol of Egypt; Pharaoh, and the land, with all its gods and its kings, and with Pharaoh, all those who place their trust in his power. Words are accumulated for the purpose of showing that the judgment will be one which shall befall the whole land, together with its gods, its rulers, and its inhabitants. First of all is mentioned Amon of No, as in <a href="/ezekiel/30-14.htm">Ezekiel 30:14</a>. &#1504;&#1488; is an abbreviation of &#1504;&#1488; &#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503; , i.e., dwelling of Amon, the sacred name of the royal city in Upper Egypt, famous in antiquity, which the Greeks called &#x394;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, or &#x398;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;, or &#x398;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; it is supposed, after the vulgar Egyptian name Tapet or Tape (Throne or Seat); see on <a href="/nahum/3-8.htm">Nahum 3:8</a>. Amon - in Greek  &#787;&#x391;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd;  (Herodotus, ii. 42),  &#787;&#x391;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd; (Plutarch, de Is. Ch. 9),  &#787;&#x391;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; (Jamblichus, de myst. 5, 8) - was a sun-god (Amon-R), probably a symbol of the sun as it appears in the spring, in the sign of the Ram; hence he was represented with rams' horns. By the Greeks he was compared to Jupiter, or Zeus, and named Jupiter Ammon. The chief seat of his worship was Thebes, where he had a temple, with a numerous learned priesthood and a famous oracle (cf. Strabo, xvii. 1. 43; Justin. xi. 11), which Cambyses destroyed (Diodorus, Siculus, Fragm. Lib. x.). Under the expression "kings of Egypt" we are not to include governors or vassal-kings, but all the kings who ever ruled Egypt; for in the judgment now falling on Egypt, all the kings it ever had, together with all its gods, are punished. In the last part of the verse the name of Pharaoh is once more given, for the purpose of attaching to it the words "and all who trust in him;" these are intended for the Jews who expected help from Egypt. The punishment consists in their being all given into the hand of their enemies, namely (&#1493; explic.) into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar and his servants. This defeat, however, is not to be the end of the Egyptian kingdom. The threat of judgment concludes, in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-26.htm">Jeremiah 46:26</a>, with a promise for the future. "Afterwards, it shall be inhabited, as in the days of yore." &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1503; is used in a neuter sense, as in <a href="/jeremiah/17-6.htm">Jeremiah 17:6</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-16.htm">Jeremiah 33:16</a>, etc. Since this verb also signifies to settle down, be encamped (<a href="/numbers/24-2.htm">Numbers 24:2</a>), and to lie quiet, to rest, or keep oneself quiet, inactive (<a href="/judges/5-17.htm">Judges 5:17</a>; <a href="/proverbs/7-11.htm">Proverbs 7:11</a>), Hitzig and Graf, with Kimchi, give the explanation: "because the power of Egypt shall be broken, it will keep quiet, and remain at home in its own country, instead of marching forth and fighting other nations, as it has lately begun again to do (<a href="/jeremiah/46-7.htm">Jeremiah 46:7</a>) after centuries of peace." But although, in support of this view, we are pointed to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-13.htm">Ezekiel 29:13</a>, where the restoration of Egypt is predicted, with the further remark, "it will be an abject kingdom," yet this idea is not contained in the words of our verse. To render &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1503; by "to keep quiet, be inactive," does not suit the words "as in the days of old." In former days, Egypt was neither inactive nor remained at home in peace in its own land. From the remotest antiquity, the Pharaohs made wars, and sought to enlarge their dominions by conquest. Add to this, that we must view the concluding portion of this prophecy in a manner analogous to the closing thought of the prophecies regarding Moab (<a href="/jeremiah/48-47.htm">Jeremiah 48:47</a>), Ammon (<a href="/jeremiah/49-6.htm">Jeremiah 49:6</a>), and Elam (<a href="/jeremiah/49-39.htm">Jeremiah 49:39</a>), where the turning of the captivity in the last times is given in prospect to these nations, and "afterwards," in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-6.htm">Jeremiah 49:6</a>, alternates with "in the latter days" found in <a href="/jeremiah/48-47.htm">Jeremiah 48:47</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/49-39.htm">Jeremiah 49:39</a>. From this it follows that, in the verse now before us also, it is not the future in general, but the last time, i.e., the Messianic future, that is pointed out; hence &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1503; does not express the peaceful condition of the land, but its being inhabited, in contrast with its depopulation in the immediate future, in consequence of its inhabitants being killed or carried away. On the fulfilment of this threatening, see p. 351ff.</body></html>
