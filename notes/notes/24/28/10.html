Personal violence, as has been the case in some Christian controversies, takes the place of further debate. The hateful symbols of servitude should not be allowed to outrage the feelings of the people any longer. His success in breaking that was to be the pledge of the destruction of the power which it represented. Jeremiah, it will be noted, does not resist or retaliate, but commits himself to Him that judgeth righteously. “He went his way.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/28.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/jeremiah/28-10.htm" title="Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from off the prophet Jeremiah's neck, and broke it....">Jeremiah 28:10-14</a></span>. <span class="ital">Then Hananiah took the yoke from off Jeremiah’s neck </span>— Thus it appears that Jeremiah wore this yoke, agreeably to the command given him by God, as a symbol of that subjection to the king of Babylon to which he admonished the Jews and other neighbouring nations to submit, in order that they might prevent the extreme evil which would otherwise fall upon them: and this yoke Hananiah took off the prophet’s neck, and broke it, by way of a symbolical sign that the Jews, and these other nations, should be freed from the Babylonian yoke within two years. <span class="ital">And the Prophet Jeremiah went his way </span>— Quietly and patiently, knowing that it would answer no good end to contend with one whose mind was heated, and in the midst of the priests and people that were violently set against him.

Those have much to answer for, who tell sinners that they shall have peace, though they harden their hearts in contempt of God's word. The servant of God must be gentle to all men. He must give up even his right, and leave the Lord to plead his cause.

"Two years" is made as definite as possible by the addition of &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;: two years in days, i.e., in two full years.See on <a href="/genesis/41-1.htm">Genesis 41:1</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/13-23.htm">2 Samuel 13:23</a>. </body></html>
