The older prophets whose names were held in honour had not spoken smooth things. They had not prophesied of peace; war, pestilence, and famine had been the burden of their predictions. And there was, therefore, an antecedent probability in favour of one who spoke in the same tone now, rather than of those who held out flattering hopes of peace and victory. The <span class= "ital">onus probandi </span>in such a conflict of claims lay with the latter, not the former.

Here is not a word of good counsel urging the Jews to repent and return to God. He promises temporal mercies, in God's name, but makes no mention of the spiritual mercies which God always promised with earthly blessings. This was not the first time Jeremiah had prayed for the people, though he prophesied against them. He appeals to the event, to prove Hananiah's falsehood. The prophet who spake only of peace and prosperity, without adding that they must not by wilful sin stop God's favours, will be proved a false prophet. Those who do not declare the alarming as well as the encouraging parts of God's word, and call men to repentance, and faith, and holiness, tread in the steps of the false prophets. The gospel of Christ encourages men to do works meet for repentance, but gives no encouragement to continue in sin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Jeremiah's own wishes concurred with Hananiah's prediction, but asserts that that prediction was at variance with the language of the older prophets.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/28.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. prophets &#8230; before me&#8212;Hosea, Joel, Amos, and others.<p>evil&#8212;a few manuscripts, read "famine," which is more usually associated with the specification of war and pestilence (Jer 15:2; 18:21; 27:8, 13).

"Two years" is made as definite as possible by the addition of &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;: two years in days, i.e., in two full years.See on <a href="/genesis/41-1.htm">Genesis 41:1</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/13-23.htm">2 Samuel 13:23</a>. </body></html>
