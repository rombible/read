And those justly lose comfort in real fears, who excuse themselves in sin by pretended fears. The removal of a prudent and peaceable ruler, and the succession of another who is rash and ambitious, affects the welfare of many. Only those are happy and steady who fear the Lord and walk in his ways.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/41.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The habitation of Chimham - The Hebrew text has Geruth-Chemoham, of which place nothing is known.

Their better way towards gaining God's favor would have been to have laid the blame on the real culprit, and to have cleared themselves. A tortuous policy is the parent of fear. Righteousness inspires with boldness (Ps 53:5; Pr 28:1).   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/41.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Here was one slain whom the conqueror Nebuchadnezzar had made governor in the land of Judah, and it was but reasonable for them to think that Nebuchadnezzar would take the affront done to himself, he being constituted governor by him; and though Johanan had nothing to do in that murder, yet he did not know but that the king of Babylon, being ignorant of any parties amongst the Jews, might look upon them, all as guilty who were Jews, and revenge Gedaliah’s blood upon all the remainder of that nation; he therefore chooseth them a habitation for the present, from whence they might in a short time go down into Egypt, which was Johanan’s design, as we shall read in, the next chapter. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/41.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Because of the Chaldeans,.... Which clause some think should have been joined to <a href="/jeremiah/41-17.htm">Jeremiah 41:17</a>. This is a reason given why they departed from Mizpah, and dwelt at the habitation of Chimham in the way to Egypt; and which is explained in the next words: <p>for they were afraid of them; at least this they pretended, that the Chaldeans would come upon them, and cut them off, and revenge themselves on them: <p>because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon made governor in the land; no doubt it was provoking to them to hear that the viceroy or deputy governor of the king of Babylon was slain in this manner; and still more so, as there were many Chaldeans slain with him; but there was no reason to believe that the king of Babylon would carry his resentment against the Jews with Johanan, or take vengeance on them, who had so bravely appeared against the murderers, and had rescued the captives out of their hands: this seems only a pretence for their going into Egypt; for though they were promised safety in Judah by the Prophet Jeremiah, yet they were still for going into Egypt, as the following chapters show. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/41.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Because of the Chaldeans: for they were afraid of them, because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon made governor in the land.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/41.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Because of the Chaldeans.</span> They were afraid of being held responsible for the crime of Ishmael.

When Johanan and the rest of the captains heard of what had taken place in Mizpah, they marched out with all their men to fight Ishmael, and came on him at the great water at Gibeon, i.e., by the pool at Gibeon which is mentioned <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-13.htm">2 Samuel 2:13</a>, one of the large receptacles for water which are still found there; see on <a href="/2_samuel/2-13.htm">2 Samuel 2:13</a>. Gibeon, now called el Jib (see on <a href="/joshua/9-3.htm">Joshua 9:3</a>), was situated only about two miles north from Mizpah; from which we may conclude that it was soon known what had happened, and the captains quickly assembled their men and marched after Ishmael. </body></html>
