In the prospect of sad times, he is to abstain from marriage, mourning for the dead, and pleasure. Those who would convince others of the truths of God, must make it appear by their self-denial, that they believe it themselves. Peace, inward and outward, family and public, is wholly the work of God, and from his loving-kindness and mercy. When He takes his peace from any people, distress must follow.

For thus hath spoken Jahveh of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I cause to cease out of this place before your eyes, and in your days, the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride."<p>What the prophet is here bidden to do and to forbear is closely bound up with the proclamation enjoined on him of judgment to come on sinful Judah. This connection is brought prominently forward in the reasons given for these commands. He is neither to take a wife nor to beget children, because all the inhabitants of the land, sons and daughters, mothers and fathers, are to perish by sickness, the sword, and famine (<a href="/jeremiah/16-3.htm">Jeremiah 16:3</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/16-4.htm">Jeremiah 16:4</a>). He is both to abstain from the customary usages of mourning for the dead, and to keep away from mirthful feasts, in order to give the people to understand that, by reason of the multitude of the dead, customary mourning will have to be given up, and that all opportunity for merry-making will disappear (<a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-5.htm">Jeremiah 16:5-9</a>). Adapting thus his actions to help to convey his message, he will approve himself to be the mouth of the Lord, and then the promised divine protection will not fail. Thus closely is this passage connected with the preceding complaint and reproof of the prophet (<a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-10.htm">Jeremiah 15:10-21</a>), while it at the same time further continues the threatening of judgment in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-1.htm">Jeremiah 15:1-9</a>. - With the prohibition to take a wife, cf. the apostle's counsel, <a href="/1_corinthians/7-26.htm">1 Corinthians 7:26</a>. "This place" alternates with "this land," and so must not be limited to Jerusalem, but bears on Judah at large. &#1497;&#1500;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;, adject. verbale, as in <a href="/exodus/1-32.htm">Exodus 1:32</a>. The form &#1502;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497; is found, besides here, only in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-8.htm">Ezekiel 28:8</a>, where it takes the place of &#1502;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;, <a href="/jeremiah/16-10.htm">Jeremiah 16:10</a>. &#1514;&#1495;&#1500;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501;  &#1502;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;, lit., deaths of sicknesses or sufferings, i.e., deaths by all kinds of sufferings, since &#1514;&#1495;&#1500;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; is not to be confined to disease, but in <a href="/jeremiah/14-18.htm">Jeremiah 14:18</a> is used of pining away by famine.
