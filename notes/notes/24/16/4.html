In the prospect of sad times, he is to abstain from marriage, mourning for the dead, and pleasure. Those who would convince others of the truths of God, must make it appear by their self-denial, that they believe it themselves. Peace, inward and outward, family and public, is wholly the work of God, and from his loving-kindness and mercy. When He takes his peace from any people, distress must follow.

Such as the sword, famine, and pestilence. The Targum particularly adds famine. It may be rendered, "deaths of diseases, or sicknesses" (u); such as are brought on by long sickness and lingering distempers; by which a man consumes gradually, as by famine, and is not snatched away at once; and which are very grievous to bear. <p>They shall not be lamented, neither shall they be buried; which two offices are usually done to the dead by their surviving relations; who mourn for them, and express their grief by various gestures, and which especially were used by the eastern nations; and take care that they have a decent burial: but neither of these would now be, which is mentioned as an aggravation of the calamity; that not only the deaths they should die of would be grievous ones, but after death no regard would be shown them; and that either because there would be none to do these things for them; or they would be so much taken up in providing for their own safety, and so much in concern for their own preservation, that they would not be at leisure to attend to the above things: <p>but they shall be as dung upon the face of the earth; lie and rot there, and be dung to the earth; which would be a just retaliation, for their filthy and abominable actions committed in the land: <p>and they shall be consumed by the sword, and by famine; the grievous deaths before mentioned; the sword without, and the famine within; the one more sudden, and at once, the other more lingering; and therefore may be more especially designed by the death of lingering sicknesses referred to: <p>and their carcasses shall be meat for the fowls of heaven, and for the beasts of the earth; lying unburied; see <a href="/jeremiah/7-33.htm">Jeremiah 7:33</a>. <p>(u)  "mortibus aegrotationum", V.

The absence of sepulture has already been pointed to several times as a feature of the horror of the times (<a href="/jeremiah/8-2.htm">Jeremiah 8:2</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/14-16.htm">Jeremiah 14:16</a>; comp. <a href="/jeremiah/7-33.htm">Jeremiah 7:33</a>), but this is a new and affecting touch. Dr. Payne Smith aptly refers to the plagues of Athens and London, in which the gentler elements of human nature were for the time almost extinguished. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>By reprimanding his impatience, and by again assuring him of His protection and of rescue from the power of his oppressors. - <a href="/jeremiah/15-19.htm">Jeremiah 15:19</a>. "Therefore thus saith Jahveh: If thou return, then will I bring thee again to serve me; and if thou separate the precious from the vile, thou shalt be as my mouth. They will return to thee, but thou shalt not return unto them. <a href="/jeremiah/15-20.htm">Jeremiah 15:20</a>. And I make thee unto this people a strong wall of brass, so that they fight against thee, but prevail not against thee; for I am with thee, to help thee and to save thee, saith Jahveh. <a href="/jeremiah/15-21.htm">Jeremiah 15:21</a>. And I save thee out of the hand of the wicked, and deliver thee out of the clutch of the violent."<p>In the words: if thou return, lies the reproach that in his complaint, in which his indignation had hurried him on to doubt God's faithfulness, Jeremiah had sinned and must repent. &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489;&#1498; is by many commentators taken adverbially and joined with the following words: then will I again cause thee to stand before me. But this adverbial use has been proved only for the Kal of &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;, not for the Hiphil, which must here be taken by itself: then will I bring thee again, sc. into proper relations with me - namely, to stand before me, i.e., to be my servant. &#1506;&#1502;&#1491; , of the standing of the servant before his lord, to receive his commands, and so also of prophets, cf. <a href="/1_kings/17-1.htm">1 Kings 17:1</a>; <a href="/1_kings/18-15.htm">1 Kings 18:15</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/3-14.htm">2 Kings 3:14</a>, etc. In the words: if thou make to go forth, i.e., separate the precious from the vile, we have the figure of metal-refining, in course of which the pure metal is by fusion parted from the earthy and other ingredients mixed with it. The meaning of the figure is, however, variously understood. Some think here, unfittingly, of good and bad men; so Chald. and Rashi: if thou cause the good to come forth of the bad, turn the good into bad; or, if out of the evil mass thou cause to come forth at least a few as good, i.e., if thou convert them (Chr. B. Mich., Ros., etc.). For we cannot here have to do with the issue of his labours, as Graf well remarks, since this did not lie in his own power. Just as little is the case one of contrast between God's word and man's word, the view adopted by Ven., Eichh., Dahl., Hitz., Ew. The idea that Jeremiah presented man's word for God's word, or God's word mixed with spurious, human additions, is utterly foreign to the context; nay, rather it was just because he declared only what God imposed on him that he was so hard bested. Further, that idea is wholly inconsistent with the nature of true prophecy. Maurer has hit upon the truth: si quae pretiosa in te sunt, admixtis liberaveris sordibus, si virtutes quas habes maculis liberaveris impatientiae et iracundiae; with whom Graf agrees. &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1497; (with the so-called &#1499; verit.), as my mouth shalt thou be, i.e., as the instrument by which I speak, cf. <a href="/exodus/4-16.htm">Exodus 4:16</a>. Then shall his labours be crowned with success. They (the adversaries) will turn themselves to thee, in the manner shown in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-11.htm">Jeremiah 15:11</a>, but thou shalt not turn thyself to them, i.e., not yield to their wishes or permit thyself to be moved by them from the right way. <a href="/jeremiah/15-20.htm">Jeremiah 15:20</a>. After this reprimand, the Lord renews to him the promise of His most active support, such as He had promised him at his call, <a href="/jeremiah/1-18.htm">Jeremiah 1:18</a>.; "to save thee" being amplified in <a href="/jeremiah/15-21.htm">Jeremiah 15:21</a>. </body></html>
