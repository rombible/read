In the prospect of sad times, he is to abstain from marriage, mourning for the dead, and pleasure. Those who would convince others of the truths of God, must make it appear by their self-denial, that they believe it themselves. Peace, inward and outward, family and public, is wholly the work of God, and from his loving-kindness and mercy. When He takes his peace from any people, distress must follow. There may be times when it is proper to avoid things otherwise our duty; and we should always sit loose to the pleasures and concerns of this life.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The times were such that for "the present distress" it was wise for all to abstain from marriage <a href="/1_corinthians/7-26.htm">1 Corinthians 7:26</a>; <a href="/matthew/24-19.htm">Matthew 24:19</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. in this place&#8212;in Judea.
