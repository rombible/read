The figs in one basket were very good, those in the other basket very bad. What creature viler than a wicked man? and what more valuable than a godly man? This vision was to raise the spirits of those gone into captivity, by assuring them of a happy return; and to humble and awaken the proud and secure spirits of those yet in Jerusalem, by assuring them of a miserable captivity. The good figs represents the pious captives. We cannot determine as to God's love or hatred by what is before us. Early suffering sometimes proves for the best. The sooner the child is corrected, the better effect the correction is likely to have. Even this captivity was for their good; and God's intentions never are in vain. By afflictions they were convinced of sin, humbled under the hand of God, weaned from the world, taught to pray, and turned from sins, particularly from idolatry. God promises that he will own them in captivity. The Lord will own those who are his, in all conditions. God assures them of his protection in trouble, and a glorious deliverance in due time. When our troubles are sanctified to us, we may be sure that they will end well. They shall return to him with their whole heart. Thus they should have liberty to own him for their God, to pray to him, and expect blessings from him. The bad figs were Zedekiah and those of his party yet in the land. These should be removed for their hurt, and forsaken of all mankind. God has many judgments, and those that escape one, may expect another, till they are brought to repent. Doubtless, this prophecy had its fulfilment in that age; but the Spirit of prophecy may here look forward to the dispersion of the unbelieving Jews, in all the nations of the earth. Let those who desire blessings from the Lord, beg that he will give them a heart to know him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The complete fulfillment of this prophecy belongs to the Christian Church. There is a close analogy between Jeremiah at the first destruction of Jerusalem and our Lord at the second. There the good figs were those converts picked out by the preaching of Christ and the Apostles; the bad figs were the mass of the people left for Titus and the Romans to destroy.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/24.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. figs &#8230; first ripe&#8212;the "boccora," or early fig (see on [923]Isa 28:4). Baskets of figs used to be offered as first-fruits in the temple. The good figs represent Jeconiah and the exiles in Babylon; the bad, Zedekiah and the obstinate Jews in Judea. They are called good and bad respectively, not in an absolute, but a comparative sense, and in reference to the punishment of the latter. This prophecy was designed to encourage the despairing exiles, and to reprove the people at home, who prided themselves as superior to those in Babylon and abused the forbearance of God (compare Jer 52:31-34).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/24.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/24.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Again the word of the Lord came unto me, saying.

In the threat &#1488;&#1514;&#1499;&#1501;  &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497; there is a manifestly designed word-play on &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488;. lxx, Vulg., Syr. have therefore rendered as if from &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497; &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488; (or &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1514;&#1497;) instead: &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#768; &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;, ego tollam vos portans. One cod. gives &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;, and Ew., Hitz., Graf, Ng., etc., hold this reading to be right; but hardly with justice. The Chald. has expressed the reading of the text in its &#1488;&#1512;&#1496;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473; &#1497;&#1514;&#1499;&#1493;&#1503; &#1502;&#1512;&#1496;&#1513;&#1473;, et relinquam vos relinquendo. And the form &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497; is explained only by reading &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488; (&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;); not by &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;, for this verb keeps its &#1488; everywhere, save with the one exception of &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468;&#1497;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/32-1.htm">Psalm 32:1</a>, formed after the parallel &#1499;&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1497;.
