The next five run on as one continuous whole, and, looking to the fact that the original record of his prophetic work during the reign of Josiah had been destroyed by Jehoiakim (<a href="/jeremiah/36-23.htm" title="And it came to pass, that when Jehudi had read three or four leaves, he cut it with the penknife, and cast it into the fire that was on the hearth, until all the roll was consumed in the fire that was on the hearth.">Jeremiah 36:23</a>), and was afterwards re-written from memory, it is probable that we have a kind of <span class= "ital">précis </span>of what was then destroyed, with some additions (<a href="/jeremiah/36-32.htm" title="Then took Jeremiah another roll, and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah; who wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire: and there were added besides to them many like words.">Jeremiah 36:32</a>), and possibly some omissions. In <a href="/jeremiah/3-6.htm" title="The LORD said also to me in the days of Josiah the king, Have you seen that which backsliding Israel has done? she is gone up on every high mountain and under every green tree, and there has played the harlot.">Jeremiah 3:6</a> we have the name of Josiah definitely mentioned.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/jeremiah/2-1.htm" title="Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,">Jeremiah 2:1</a></span>. <span class="ital">Moreover, the word of the Lord came unto me </span>— The discourse begun here is continued to the end of the fifth verse of the next chapter. In it God professes to retain the same kind and merciful disposition toward his people which he had manifested in their earlier days. He expostulates with them on their ungrateful returns for his past goodness, and shows that it was not want of love in him, but their own extreme and unparalleled wickedness, which had already subjected, and would still subject them, to calamities and misery. He concludes with a pathetic address, exhorting them to return to him, with an implied promise of acceptance; and laments the necessity he was under, through their continued obstinacy, of giving them further proofs of his displeasure.

Those who desert religion, commonly oppose it more than those who never knew it. For this they could have no excuse.

The warning not to rely as they did on Egypt (Jer 2:18), was in accordance with Josiah's policy, who took part with Assyria and Babylon against Egypt (2Ki 23:29). Jeremiah, doubtless, supported the reformation begun by Josiah, in the previous year (the twelfth of his reign), and fully carried out in the eighteenth.God’s numerous and continued mercies render the Jews in their idolatry inexcusable, and unparalleled in any nation; and themselves the causes of their calamities, <span class="bld"><a href="/context/jeremiah/2-1.htm" title="Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,...">Jeremiah 2:1-19</a></span>.

In favour of (<span class="ital">a</span>) is urged (i) the sense of the rest of the <span class="ital">v</span>., (ii) that the ‘kindness’ and ‘love’ spoken of evidently refer to the past, while God’s attitude of grace towards Israel is still the same that it has ever been. On the other hand for (<span class="ital">b</span>) it may be said (i) that the original word (<span class="greekheb">חֶסֶד</span>) is ordinarily used of God’s attitude to man (but see <a href="/isaiah/57-1.htm" title="The righteous perishes, and no man lays it to heart: and merciful men are taken away, none considering that the righteous is taken away from the evil to come.">Isaiah 57:1</a>; <a href="/hosea/6-4.htm" title="O Ephraim, what shall I do to you? O Judah, what shall I do to you? for your goodness is as a morning cloud, and as the early dew it goes away.">Hosea 6:4</a>; <a href="/hosea/6-6.htm" title="For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.">Hosea 6:6</a>), (ii) that even in the wilderness Israel was often unfaithful (cp. <a href="/jeremiah/7-25.htm" title="Since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt to this day I have even sent to you all my servants the prophets, daily rising up early and sending them:">Jeremiah 7:25</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/2-3.htm" title="And he said to me, Son of man, I send you to the children of Israel, to a rebellious nation that has rebelled against me: they and their fathers have transgressed against me, even to this very day.">Ezekiel 2:3</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/20-13.htm" title="But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness: they walked not in my statutes, and they despised my judgments, which if a man do, he shall even live in them; and my sabbaths they greatly polluted: then I said, I would pour out my fury on them in the wilderness, to consume them.">Ezekiel 20:13</a> ff.), (iii) that the whole tone of Deut., to which these prophecies (see Intr. iii. § 16) are so closely related in language, indicates God’s free choice of Israel and her ingratitude. In this latter case the sense will be (using a bold metaphor), “I have not forgotten my love for my young bride,” i.e. Israel’s consecration and my promise to defend her. For this metaphorical application of the thought of a marriage union between Jehovah and Israel, cp. <a href="/isaiah/54-1.htm" title="Sing, O barren, you that did not bear; break forth into singing, and cry aloud, you that did not travail with child: for more are the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife, said the LORD.">Isaiah 54:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/54-4.htm" title="Fear not; for you shall not be ashamed: neither be you confounded; for you shall not be put to shame: for you shall forget the shame of your youth, and shall not remember the reproach of your widowhood any more.">Isaiah 54:4</a> ff., <a href="/isaiah/62-4.htm" title="You shall no more be termed Forsaken; neither shall your land any more be termed Desolate: but you shall be called Hephzibah, and your land Beulah: for the LORD delights in you, and your land shall be married.">Isaiah 62:4</a> f.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Seething Pot. - <a href="/jeremiah/1-13.htm">Jeremiah 1:13</a>. "And there came to me the word of Jahveh for the second time, saying, What seest thou? And I:said: I see a seething-pot; and it looketh hither from the north. <a href="/jeremiah/1-14.htm">Jeremiah 1:14</a>. Then said Jahveh to me: From the north will trouble break forth upon all inhabitants of the land. <a href="/jeremiah/1-15.htm">Jeremiah 1:15</a>. For, behold, I call to all families of the kingdoms towards the north, saith Jahveh; that they come and set each his throne before the gates of Jerusalem, and against all her walls round about, and against all cities of Judah. <a href="/jeremiah/1-16.htm">Jeremiah 1:16</a>. And I will pronounce judgment against them for all their wickedness, in that they have forsaken me, and have offered odours to other gods, and worshipped the work of their hands." &#1505;&#1497;&#1512; is a large pot or caldron in which can be cooked vegetables or meat for many persons at once; cf. <a href="/2_kings/4-38.htm">2 Kings 4:38</a>., <a href="/ezekiel/24-3.htm">Ezekiel 24:3</a>. &#1504;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;, fanned, blown upon, used of fire, <a href="/ezekiel/21-36.htm">Ezekiel 21:36</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/22-20.htm">Ezekiel 22:20</a>.; then by transference, seething, steaming, since the caldron under which fire is fanned steams, its contents boil; cf. <a href="/job/41-12.htm">Job 41:12</a>. The &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; of the pot is the side turned to the spectator (the prophet), the side towards the front. This is turned from the north this way, i.e., set so that its contents will run thence this way. &#1510;&#1508;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492;, properly: towards the north; then, that which lies towards the north, or the northerly direction. In the interpretation of this symbol in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-14.htm">Jeremiah 1:14</a>, &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1495;, assonant to &#1504;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;, is introduced, just as in <a href="/amos/8-2.htm">Amos 8:2</a> &#1511;&#1497;&#1509;  is explained by &#1511;&#1509;; so that there was no occasion for the conjecture of Houbig. and Graf: &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1495;, it is fanned up; and against this we have Hitzig's objection that the Hophal of &#1504;&#1508;&#1495; never occurs. Equally uncalled for is Hitzig's own conjecture, xaw%pt@f, it will steam, fume, be kindled; while against this we have the fact, that as to xpanf no evidence can be given for the meaning be kindled, and that we have no cases of such a mode of speaking as: the trouble is fuming, steaming up. The Arabian poetical saying: their pot steams or boils, i.e., a war is being prepared by them, is not sufficient to justify such a figure. We hold then &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1495; for the correct reading, and decline to be led astray by the paraphrastic &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; of the lxx, since &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1495; gives a suitable sense. It is true, indeed, that &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1495; usually means open; but an opening of the caldron by the removal of the lid is not (with Graf) to be thought of. But, again, &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1495; has the derived sig. let loose, let off (cf. ,&#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1495; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497; <a href="/isaiah/14-17.htm">Isaiah 14:17</a>), from which there can be no difficulty in inferring for the Niph. the sig. be let loose, and in the case of trouble, calamity: break forth. That which is in the pot runs over as the heat increases, and pours itself on the hearth or ground. If the seething contents of the pot represent disaster, their running over will point to its being let loose, its breaking out.  are the inhabitants of the land of Judah, as the interpretation in <a href="/jeremiah/1-15.htm">Jeremiah 1:15</a> shows. In <a href="/jeremiah/1-15.htm">Jeremiah 1:15</a> reference to the figure is given up, and the further meaning is given in direct statement. The Lord will call to all families of the kingdoms of the north, and they will come ( equals  that they are to come). The kingdoms of the north are not merely the kingdoms of Syria, but in general those of Upper Asia; since all armies marching from the Euphrates towards Palestine entered the land from the north. &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514;, families, are the separate races of nations, hence often used in parallelism with &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501;; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/10-25.htm">Jeremiah 10:25</a>; <a href="/nahum/3-4.htm">Nahum 3:4</a>. We must not conclude from this explanation of the vision seen that the seething pot symbolizes the Chaldeans themselves or the kingdom of Nebuchadnezzar; such a figure would be too unnatural. The seething pot, whose contents boil over, symbolizes the disaster and ruin which the families of the kingdoms of the north will pour out on Judah. </body></html>
