Kimchi says this is spoken concerning Abraham; no doubt respect is had to the Jewish fathers, such as Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the twelve patriarchs, Moses, Joshua, and Caleb, and the like; who, having the true and right seed of grace in them, became like choice and noble vines, and brought forth much fruit, and were deserving of imitation by their posterity: <p>how then art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine unto me? like a vine that grows in the woods, and brings forth wild grapes; so these, their sons, degenerating in practice from their fathers, became corrupt in themselves, and unprofitable to God.

Jeremiah means the choicest kind of Oriental vine, called <span class="accented">sorek</span> (from the dark-red color of its grapes), and mentioned again in <a href="/isaiah/5-2.htm">Isaiah 5:2</a>. The figure of the vine is one endeared to us by its association especially with our Lord; it was endeared to the Jews by the annual festivities of the vintage. The sacred writers are never afraid of its palling on the ear by repetition (comp. <a href="/jeremiah/5-10.htm">Jeremiah 5:10</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/6-9.htm">Jeremiah 6:9</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/12-10.htm">Jeremiah 12:10</a>; <a href="/isaiah/5-1.htm">Isaiah 5:1-7</a>; <a href="/isaiah/27-2.htm">Isaiah 27:2, 3</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/17-6.htm">Ezekiel 17:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/80-8.htm">Psalm 80:8-16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">A right seed</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. a vine-shoot of the genuine sort.

Nevertheless it will not cease its intriguing with the heathen nations. <a href="/jeremiah/2-14.htm">Jeremiah 2:14</a>. "Is Israel a servant? is he a home-born slave? why is he become a booty? <a href="/jeremiah/2-15.htm">Jeremiah 2:15</a>. Against him roared the young lions, let their voice be heard, and made his land a waste; his cities were burnt up void of inhabitants. <a href="/jeremiah/2-16.htm">Jeremiah 2:16</a>. Also the sons of Noph and Tahpanes feed on the crown of thy head. <a href="/jeremiah/2-17.htm">Jeremiah 2:17</a>. Does not this bring it upon thee, thy forsaking Jahveh thy God, at the time when He led thee on the way? <a href="/jeremiah/2-18.htm">Jeremiah 2:18</a>. And now what hast thou to do with the way to Egypt, to drink the waters of the Nile? and what with the way to Assur, to drink the waters of the river? <a href="/jeremiah/2-19.htm">Jeremiah 2:19</a>. Thy wickedness chastises thee, and thy backslidings punish thee; then know and see that it is evil and bitter to forsake Jahveh thy God, and to have no fear of me, saith the Lord Jahveh of hosts." The thought from <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-14.htm">Jeremiah 2:14-16</a> is this: Israel was plundered and abused by the nations like a slave. To characterize such a fate as in direct contradiction to its destiny is the aim of the question: Is Israel a servant? i.e., a slave or a house-born serf. &#1506;&#1489;&#1491; is he who has in any way fallen into slavery,  &#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1491;  &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;a slave born in the house of his master. The distinction between these two classes of salves does not consist in the superior value of the servant born in the house by reason of his attachment to the house. This peculiarity is not here thought of, but only the circumstance that the son of a salve, born in the house, remained a slave without any prospect of being set free; while the man who has been forced into slavery by one of the vicissitudes of life might hope again to acquire his freedom by some favourable turn of circumstances. Another failure is the attempt of Hitz. to interpret &#1506;&#1489;&#1491; as servant of Jahveh, worshipper of the true God; for this interpretation, even if we take no account of all the other arguments that make against it, is rendered impossible by .&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1491; That expression never means the son of the house, but by unfailing usage the slave born in the house of his master. Now the people of Israel had not been born as serf in the land of Jahveh, but had become &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;, i.e., slave, in Egypt (<a href="/deuteronomy/5-15.htm">Deuteronomy 5:15</a>); but Jahveh has redeemed it from this bondage and made it His people. The questions suppose a state of affairs that did not exist. This is shown by the next question, one expressing wonder: Why then is he it become a prey? Slaves are treated as a prey, but Israel was no slave; why then has such treatment fallen to his lot? Propheta per admirationem quasi de re nova et absurda sciscitatur. An servus est Israel? atqui erat liber prae cunctis gentibus, erat enim filius primogenitus Dei; necesse est igitur quaerere aliam causam, cur adeo miser sit (Calv.). Cf. the similar turn of the thought in <a href="/jeremiah/2-31.htm">Jeremiah 2:31</a>. How Israel became a prey is shown in <a href="/jeremiah/2-15.htm">Jeremiah 2:15</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/2-16.htm">Jeremiah 2:16</a>. These verses do not treat of future events, but of what has already happened, and, according to <a href="/jeremiah/2-18.htm">Jeremiah 2:18</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-19.htm">Jeremiah 2:19</a>, will still continue. The imperff. &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1490;&#1493;&#1468; and &#1497;&#1512;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498; alternate consequently with the perff. &#1504;&#1514;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; and &#1504;&#1510;&#1468;&#1514;&#1492;, and are governed by &#1492;&#1497;&#1492;  &#1500;&#1489;&#1494;, so that they are utterances regarding events of the past, which have been and are still repeated. Lions are a figure that frequently stands for enemies thirsting for plunder, who burst in upon a people or land; cf. <a href="/micah/5-7.htm">Micah 5:7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/5-29.htm">Isaiah 5:29</a>, etc. Roared &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;, against him, not, over him: the lion roars when he is about to rush upon his prey, <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/3-4.htm">Amos 3:4</a>, <a href="/amos/3-8.htm">Amos 3:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/104-21.htm">Psalm 104:21</a>; <a href="/judges/14-5.htm">Judges 14:5</a>; when he has pounced upon it he growls or grumbles over it; cf. <a href="/isaiah/31-4.htm">Isaiah 31:4</a>. - In <a href="/jeremiah/2-15.htm">Jeremiah 2:15</a> the figurative manner passes into plain statement. They made his land a waste; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/4-7.htm">Jeremiah 4:7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-16.htm">Jeremiah 18:16</a>, etc., where instead of &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514; we have the more ordinary &#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;. The Cheth. &#1504;&#1510;&#1468;&#1514;&#1492; from &#1497;&#1510;&#1514;, not from the Ethiop. &#1504;&#1510;&#1492; (Graf, Hitz.), is to be retained; the Keri here, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-6.htm">Jeremiah 22:6</a>, is an unnecessary correction; cf. Ew. 317, a. In this delineation Jeremiah has in his eye chiefly the land of the ten tribes, which had been ravaged and depopulated by the Assyrians, even although Judah had often suffered partial devastations by enemies; cf. <a href="/1_kings/14-25.htm">1 Kings 14:25</a>.</body></html>
