According to this reading, which seems very just and unexceptionable, and is approved by Houbigant and Dr. Waterland, the meaning of the passage is, that even after the Jews had been freed, by God, from their Egyptian bondage, and admitted into an immediate covenant and alliance with him, they had been guilty of the utmost ingratitude in refusing obedience to the divine law, and particularly in respect to the prohibition of idolatry. <span class="ital">When upon every high hill, and under every green tree, </span>&c. — Alluding to their worshipping their idols upon the hills, and under the trees; <span class="ital">thou wanderest, playing the harlot </span>— Worshipping false gods.

The constitution of the Israelitish government, both in church and state, was excellent; their laws righteous, and all their ordinances instructive, and very significant; and there was a generation of good men among them, when they first settled in Canaan.

The yoke of the people, as the Targum expresses it, that was upon their necks, and the bands in which they were bound by them; referring to the deliverance of them of old from Egyptian bondage by the hands of Moses, and out of their several captivities among their neighbours by the means of the judges, and in their time; though the Vulgate Latin version renders it, "of old thou hast broken my yoke, and burst my bands"; or "thy yoke", and "thy bands", as the Septuagint and Arabic versions; the yoke of the law that the Lord put upon them, and the bands of statutes and ordinances which he enjoined them; but the former sense is best: <p>and thou saidst, I will not transgress; here is a double reading; the Cetib or writing is  "I will not serve"; which is followed by the Vulgate Latin, which so renders it; and by the Septuagint version, "I will not serve thee"; and which is the sense of the Arabic version, "I will not subject myself", that is, to the law and will of God; and so the Syriac version, though to a quite different sense, "I will serve no other god any more": which agrees with the Keri or reading, which is  "I will not transgress"; and this is confirmed by the Targum, which paraphrases the words thus, <p>"and ye said, we will not add any more to transgress thy word;'' <p>and by Jarchi and Kimchi, who interpret it of transgressing the words and commands of God; both have one and the same sense. For whether it be read, "I will not serve"; the meaning is, as Kimchi observes, "I will not serve idols"; or no other god, as the Syriac version: or whether, "I will not transgress"; that is, the command of the Lord, by serving other gods. Hillerus (p) reconciles the writing and reading after this manner, rendering , "I will not serve", and , "I will not pass", to servitude; though, in another place (q) "I will not pass over", that is, the rivers of Tigris and Euphrates with the captives; and refers to <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/1-11.htm">Micah 1:11</a>, but doubtless reference is had to the promise of obedience and service, which the Israelites made at Mount Sinai quickly after their deliverance out of Egypt, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/19-8.htm">Exodus 19:8</a>, but this promise they did not keep: "when", or "for", or "but", or "although" (r), <p>upon every high hill, and under every green tree, thou wanderest, playing the harlot; that is, committing spiritual whoredom or idolatry with idols, set on high hills and mountains, and under green trees, groves, and shady places; going from one idol to another, as harlots go from one stew to another; or as whoremongers go from harlot to harlot. <p>(p) De Arcano Kethib &amp; Keri, p. 27, 28.

The passage appears to be an echo of <a href="/hosea/4-13.htm" title="They sacrifice on the tops of the mountains, and burn incense on the hills, under oaks and poplars and elms, because the shadow thereof is good: therefore your daughters shall commit prostitution, and your spouses shall commit adultery.">Hosea 4:13</a> f.

The danger involved in retaining the places of worship which the heathen inhabitants had used is indicated by the command in <a href="/deuteronomy/12-2.htm" title="You shall utterly destroy all the places, wherein the nations which you shall possess served their gods, on the high mountains, and on the hills, and under every green tree:">Deuteronomy 12:2</a> f.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - Here a new section begins. <span class="cmt_word">I have broken... burst</span>. This is, grammatically, a possible rendering, but inconsistent with the second person in <span class="cmt_word">thou saidst</span>, unless indeed (with Ewald) we suppose that something has fallen out of the text between the first and the second clauses of the verse. The best critics, except Ewald and Dr. Payne Smith, are agreed that we should follow the Septuagint and Vulgate in rendering "thou hast broken... (and) burst." This does not, strictly speaking, imply a new reading of the text, for <span class="accented">ti</span> was the old form of the suffix of the 2nd pers. fem, sing.; there is a precisely similar case in <a href="/micah/4-13.htm">Micah 4:13</a>. It is a true description of the history of Israel before the exile. It would almost seem as if there was a fusion of two races among the Israelites, and that the smaller but nobler stock supplied all the great men in the sphere of religion; just as in Florence, most of the men who have illustrated her annals bear names of Teutonic origin.

But God (to apply the Caliph Omar's words) "knoweth his own." <span class="cmt_word">Bands</span> (see on Jeremiah 5:5). <span class="cmt_word">I will not transgress.</span> This is the translation of the marginal reading in the Hebrew Bible, which, though implied also in the Targum, is probably a conjecture of the Jewish critics. The text reading (also that of the Septuagint and the Syriac) is, "I will not serve," (equivalent to "I will not be a slave any longer"). Obviously this does not harmonize with the rendering "I have broken," etc., in the first clause (unless, with Dr. Payne Smith, we explain "I will not serve" as virtually equivalent to "I will still serve my idol-gods"); hence the Jewish critics, by just adding a <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> (<a href="/matthew/5-18.htm">Matthew 5:18</a>), changed "serve" into "transgress." They did not venture to alter the next clause, which, quite as much as the first, presupposes the reading "serve" (see next note). <span class="cmt_word">When</span> - rather, <span class="accented">for</span> - <span class="cmt_word">upon every high hill</span>, etc. Bare, treeless heights were favorite spots for sacrifices, especially for Baal; groves, and leafy trees, in general, for the lascivious rites of Asherah and Ashtoreth.

To characterize such a fate as in direct contradiction to its destiny is the aim of the question: Is Israel a servant? i.e., a slave or a house-born serf. &#1506;&#1489;&#1491; is he who has in any way fallen into slavery,  &#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1491;  &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;a slave born in the house of his master. The distinction between these two classes of salves does not consist in the superior value of the servant born in the house by reason of his attachment to the house. This peculiarity is not here thought of, but only the circumstance that the son of a salve, born in the house, remained a slave without any prospect of being set free; while the man who has been forced into slavery by one of the vicissitudes of life might hope again to acquire his freedom by some favourable turn of circumstances. Another failure is the attempt of Hitz. to interpret &#1506;&#1489;&#1491; as servant of Jahveh, worshipper of the true God; for this interpretation, even if we take no account of all the other arguments that make against it, is rendered impossible by .&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1491; That expression never means the son of the house, but by unfailing usage the slave born in the house of his master. Now the people of Israel had not been born as serf in the land of Jahveh, but had become &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;, i.e., slave, in Egypt (<a href="/deuteronomy/5-15.htm">Deuteronomy 5:15</a>); but Jahveh has redeemed it from this bondage and made it His people. The questions suppose a state of affairs that did not exist. This is shown by the next question, one expressing wonder: Why then is he it become a prey? Slaves are treated as a prey, but Israel was no slave; why then has such treatment fallen to his lot? Propheta per admirationem quasi de re nova et absurda sciscitatur. An servus est Israel? atqui erat liber prae cunctis gentibus, erat enim filius primogenitus Dei; necesse est igitur quaerere aliam causam, cur adeo miser sit (Calv.). Cf. the similar turn of the thought in <a href="/jeremiah/2-31.htm">Jeremiah 2:31</a>. How Israel became a prey is shown in <a href="/jeremiah/2-15.htm">Jeremiah 2:15</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/2-16.htm">Jeremiah 2:16</a>. These verses do not treat of future events, but of what has already happened, and, according to <a href="/jeremiah/2-18.htm">Jeremiah 2:18</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-19.htm">Jeremiah 2:19</a>, will still continue. The imperff. &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1490;&#1493;&#1468; and &#1497;&#1512;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498; alternate consequently with the perff. &#1504;&#1514;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; and &#1504;&#1510;&#1468;&#1514;&#1492;, and are governed by &#1492;&#1497;&#1492;  &#1500;&#1489;&#1494;, so that they are utterances regarding events of the past, which have been and are still repeated. Lions are a figure that frequently stands for enemies thirsting for plunder, who burst in upon a people or land; cf. <a href="/micah/5-7.htm">Micah 5:7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/5-29.htm">Isaiah 5:29</a>, etc. Roared &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;, against him, not, over him: the lion roars when he is about to rush upon his prey, <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/3-4.htm">Amos 3:4</a>, <a href="/amos/3-8.htm">Amos 3:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/104-21.htm">Psalm 104:21</a>; <a href="/judges/14-5.htm">Judges 14:5</a>; when he has pounced upon it he growls or grumbles over it; cf. <a href="/isaiah/31-4.htm">Isaiah 31:4</a>. - In <a href="/jeremiah/2-15.htm">Jeremiah 2:15</a> the figurative manner passes into plain statement. They made his land a waste; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/4-7.htm">Jeremiah 4:7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-16.htm">Jeremiah 18:16</a>, etc., where instead of &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514; we have the more ordinary &#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;. The Cheth. &#1504;&#1510;&#1468;&#1514;&#1492; from &#1497;&#1510;&#1514;, not from the Ethiop. &#1504;&#1510;&#1492; (Graf, Hitz.), is to be retained; the Keri here, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-6.htm">Jeremiah 22:6</a>, is an unnecessary correction; cf. Ew. 317, a. In this delineation Jeremiah has in his eye chiefly the land of the ten tribes, which had been ravaged and depopulated by the Assyrians, even although Judah had often suffered partial devastations by enemies; cf. <a href="/1_kings/14-25.htm">1 Kings 14:25</a>.</body></html>
