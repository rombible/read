Because they had the temple, and sacrifices offered therein, &c., they still persuaded themselves that they worshipped the true God, though they joined their idolatries with his worship.

The LXX. seem so to have understood it: <span class="greekheb">εν τη ταπεινωσει αυτης ευρησουσιν αυτην</span>, ‘when she is humbled, they shall find her.’ And perhaps it was designed to insinuate to the Jews, by way of reproach, that they were less governable than even the brute beast, which, after having followed the bent of appetite for a little time, would cool again, and return quietly home to her owners: but the idolatrous fit in them seemed never to abate, nor to suffer the people to return to their duty. Or else it may mean, that when their affairs took a new turn, and became adverse, then would be the time when, being humbled, they would again have recourse to the true God who alone could save them.” The expression, <span class="ital">in her month, </span>is explained in the margin of our ancient Bible to mean, <span class="ital">when she is with foal, </span>an interpretation which many commentators follow. Thus Henry: “They that seek her will have a little patience till she is big with young, heavy, and unwieldy; and then they shall find her, and she cannot outrun them.” And he thus applies it: “The time will come when the most fierce will be tamed, and the most wanton will be manageable: when distress and anguish come upon them, then their ears will be open to discipline; that is the <span class="ital">month </span>in which you <span class="ital">may find them.” </span><a href="/context/psalms/141-5.htm" title="Let the righteous smite me; it shall be a kindness: and let him reprove me; it shall be an excellent oil, which shall not break my head: for yet my prayer also shall be in their calamities....">Psalm 141:5-6</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:20-28 Notwithstanding all their advantages, Israel had become like the wild vine that bears poisonous fruit.

No man can say this; for all are defiled with sin; but this was the cast and complexion of these people in all ages; they were a generation of men that were pure in their own eyes, but were not cleansed from their filthiness; they fancied that their ceremonial washings and sacrifices cleansed them from moral impurities, when those only sanctified to the purifying of the flesh; still their iniquity remained marked before the Lord; they acted the part of the adulterous woman in <a href="/proverbs/30-20.htm">Proverbs 30:20</a> to whom they are compared in the context; and, therefore, as wondering at their impudence, they having a whore's forehead, this question is put, how and with what face they could affirm this, and what follows: <p>I have not gone after Baalim? or, "the Baalim"; the idols of the people, as the Targum interprets it; for there were many Baals, as Baalzephon, Baalpeor, Baalzebub, and others: <p>see thy way in the valley; where idols were set up and worshipped; or through which the way lay, as Kimchi observes, to the hills and mountains where idolatry was frequently committed; perhaps no particular valley is meant, but any in which idols were worshipped, or which they passed through to the worshipping of them; though the Targum interprets it of the valley in which they dwelt, over against Baalpeor, so Jarchi and Abarbinel, when they worshipped that idol; and seems to design the valley of Shittim, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/25-1.htm">Numbers 25:1</a>, but rather, if any particular valley is intended, the valley of Hinnom seems to bid fair for it; and to this it may be the Septuagint version has respect, rendering it  , "in the sepulchre of the multitude"; multitudes being burnt and buried here: <p>know what thou hast done; in the valley, especially in the valley of Hinnom, where they caused their children to pass through the fire to Molech: <p>thou art a swift dromedary. The Targum, Jarchi, and Kimchi, interpret it a young camel; and so the word in the Arabic language signifies; and the epithet "swift" better agrees with that than with the dromedary. Curtius (z) makes mention of dromedary camels of great swiftness; but it may be this is to be understood, not of its swiftness in running, but of its impetuous lust, as Calvin observes; and, indeed, each of these creatures are very libidinous; and therefore these people are compared to them; See Gill on <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/1-13.htm">Micah 1:13</a>, it follows: <p>traversing her ways; running about here and there after the male, burning with lust, sometimes one way, and sometimes another; and so these people sometimes run after one idol, and sometimes another, and followed a multitude of them. The Targum renders it, "which corrupts or depraves her ways". De Dieu observes, that the word  in the Ethiopic language, signifies "the evening"; and so may intend walking in the evening, in the dark, rather than in the light; which, as it is the way of dromedaries, and almost of all beasts, so of harlots, to whom these people are likened; and he further observes, that, in the Arabic language, it signifies to make common, which agrees with adulterous persons, as these were in a spiritual sense. The word is only used in this place, and is deduced from, or has some relation to, the word  which signifies a "shoelatchet", <a href="/genesis/14-23.htm">Genesis 14:23</a> as Jarchi and Kimchi observe; and may denote, as the shoe is bound and fastened with the latchet, the binding of her ways to her heart, as the former suggests, the strengthening and confirming of her in her evil ways, and her constant persisting therein; but the first sense of running here and there through lust is best; and is approved by Bynaeus (a) and by Buxtorf (b). <p>(z) (Curtius) L. 5. c. 2.((a) De Calceis Heb. l. 1. c. 7. sect. 4.

If we may assume that this utterance relates to the time before Josiah’s reforms, the people could not deny that their worship at the high places included observances outside those belonging to Jehovah.

This is not a mere rhetorical fiction equivalent to "or if thou shouldst perhaps say," but probably represents an objection really made by the inhabitants of the kingdom of Judah. Their fault was not in neglecting the public worship of Jehovah in his appointed temple, but in superadding to this, idolatrous rites inconsistent with the spiritual religion taught by Jeremiah. The people did not, it seems, regard this as tantamount to "following Baalim," just as some converts to Christianity in our own foreign missions might exclaim against being accused of apostasy, because they secretly carry on certain heathen practices. The prophet, however, applies a more rigorous test to their conduct. <span class="cmt_word">Baalim</span>; the plural of Baal, used for "other gods" (<a href="/jeremiah/1-16.htm">Jeremiah 1:16</a>; comp. on ver. 8). <span class="cmt_word">Thy way in the valley</span>. <span class="accented">The valley</span> in this context can only be that of Hinnom (see on Jeremiah 7:31), which from the time of Ahaz had been defiled with the rites of "Moloch, horrid king" (see ' Paradise Lost,' 1:392-396). <span class="cmt_word">Thou art a swift dromedary</span>. Ewald would attach this half of the verse to ver. 24; and there is something to be said for this plan. <span class="accented">Swift dromedary</span> is, properly speaking, in the vocative. The ardor of the people for idolatry is expressed by the comparison of it to the uncontrollable instinct of brute beasts. The word rendered "dromedary" is in the feminine gender; it means strictly the young she-camel which has not yet had a foal. <span class="cmt_word">Traversing her ways</span>; rather, <span class="accented">interlacing her ways</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. running backwards and forwards at the impulse of passion. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In <a href="/jeremiah/2-17.htm">Jeremiah 2:17</a> the question as to the cause of the evil is answered. &#1494;&#1488;&#1514; is the above-mentioned evil, that Israel had become a prey to the foe. This thy forsaking of Jahveh makes or prepares for thee. &#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; is neuter; the infin. &#1506;&#1494;&#1489;&#1498; is the subject of the clause, and it is construed as a neuter, as in <a href="/1_samuel/18-23.htm">1 Samuel 18:23</a>. The fact that thou hast forsaken Jahveh thy God has brought this evil on thee. At the time when He led thee on the way. The participle &#1502;&#1493;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498; is subordinated to &#1506;&#1514; in the stat. constr. as a partic. standing for the praeterit. durans; cf. Ew. 337, c. &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; is understood by Ros. and Hitz. of the right way (<a href="/psalms/25-8.htm">Psalm 25:8</a>); but in this they forget that this acceptation is incompatible with the &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514;, which circumscribes the leading within a definite time. God will lead His people on the right way at all times. The way on which He led them at the particular time is the way through the Arabian desert, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-6.htm">Jeremiah 2:6</a>, and &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; is to be understood as in <a href="/deuteronomy/1-33.htm">Deuteronomy 1:33</a>; <a href="/exodus/18-8.htm">Exodus 18:8</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/23-20.htm">Exodus 23:20</a>, etc. Even thus early their fathers forsook the Lord: At Sinai, by the worship of the golden calf; then when the people rose against Moses and Aaron in the desert of Paran, called a rejecting (&#1504;&#1488;&#1509;) of Jahveh in <a href="/numbers/14-11.htm">Numbers 14:11</a>; and at Shittim, where Israel joined himself to Baal Peor, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/25-1.htm">Numbers 25:1-3</a>. The forsaking of Jahveh is not to be limited to direct idolatry, but comprehends also the seeking of help from the heathen; this is shown by the following 18th verse, in which the reproaches are extended to the present bearing of the people. ' &#1502;&#1492;&#1470;&#1500;&#1468;&#1498;  &#1500;&#1491;&#1512;&#1498;  &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;, lit., what is to thee in reference to the way of Egypt (for the expression, see <a href="/hosea/14-9.htm">Hosea 14:9</a>), i.e., what hast thou to do with the way of Egypt? Why dost thou arise to go into Egypt, to drink the water of the Nile? &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1493;&#1512;, the black, turbid stream, is a name for the Nile, taken from its dark-grey or black mud. The Nile is the life-giving artery of Egypt, on whose fertilizing waters the fruitfulness and the prosperity of the country depend. To drink the waters of the Nile is as much as to say to procure for oneself the sources of Egypt's life, to make the power of Egypt useful to oneself. Analogous to this is the drinking the waters of the river, i.e., the Euphrates. What is meant is seeking help from Egyptians and Assyrians. The water of the Nile and of the Euphrates was to be made to furnish them with that which the fountain of living water, i.e., Jahveh (<a href="/jeremiah/2-14.htm">Jeremiah 2:14</a>), supplied to them. This is an old sin, and with it Israel of the ten tribes is upbraided by Hosea (<a href="/hosea/7-11.htm">Hosea 7:11</a>; <a href="/hosea/12-2.htm">Hosea 12:2</a>). From this we are not to infer "that here we have nothing to do with the present, since the existing Israel, Judah, was surely no longer a suitor for the assistance of Assyria, already grown powerless" (Hitz.). The limitation of the reproach solely to the past is irreconcilable with the terms of the verse and with the context (<a href="/jeremiah/2-19.htm">Jeremiah 2:19</a>).  &#1502;&#1492;&#1470;&#1500;&#1468;&#1498; &#1500;&#1491;&#1512;&#1498;cannot grammatically be translated: What hadst thou to do with the way; just as little can we make &#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1505;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; hath chastised thee, since the following: know and see, is then utterly unsuitable to it. &#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1505;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; and &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1499;&#1497;&#1495;&#1498; are not futures, but imperfects, i.e., expressing what is wont to happen over again in each similar case; and so to be expressed in English by the present: thy wickedness, i.e., thy wicked work, chastises thee. The wickedness was shown in forsaking Jahveh, in the &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;, backslidings, the repeated defection from the living God; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/3-22.htm">Jeremiah 3:22</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/5-6.htm">Jeremiah 5:6</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/14-7.htm">Jeremiah 14:7</a>. As to the fact, we have no historical evidence that under Josiah political alliance with Egypt or Assyria was compassed; but even if no formal negotiations took place, the country was certainly even then not without a party to build its hopes on one or other of the great powers between which Judah lay, whenever a conflict arose with either of them. -  &#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1506;&#1497;, with the Vav of consecution (see Ew. 347, a): Know then, and at last comprehend, that forsaking the Lord thy God is evil and bitter, i.e., bears evil and bitter fruit, prepares bitter misery for thee. "To have no fear of me" corresponds "to forsake," lit., thy forsaking, as second subject; lit.,: and the no fear of me in thee, i.e., the fact that thou hast no awe of me. &#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1491;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;, awe of me, like &#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1491;&#1468;&#1498; in <a href="/deuteronomy/2-25.htm">Deuteronomy 2:25</a>. </body></html>
