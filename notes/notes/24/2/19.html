But the text is true in reference to individuals.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. The universal indictment.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>This is not so much a charge of isolated overt acts, as of departure from God. That departure, itself a sin, is the fountain of all other sins. Every act which is morally wrong is religiously a departure from God; it could not be done, unless heart and will had moved away from their allegiance to Him. So the solemn mystery of right and wrong becomes yet more solemn, when our personal relation to the personal God is brought in.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Then-consider what this forsaking is-at bottom aversion of will, or rather of the whole nature, from Him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> How strange and awful is that power which a creature possesses of closing his heart against God, and setting up a quasi-independence!<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> How universal it is-appeal to each man’s own consciousness.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. The special aggravation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>‘<span class="ital">Thy God</span> ‘-the original reference is to Israel, whom God had taken for His and to whom He had given Himself as theirs, by His choice from of old, by redemption from Egypt, by covenant, and by centuries of blessings. But the designation is true in regard to God and each of us. It points to the personal relation which we each sustain to Him, and so is a pathetic appeal to affection and gratitude.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">III. The bitter fruit.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>6 Evil’ may express rather the moral character of forsaking God, while ‘bitter’ expresses rather the consequences of it, which are sorrows.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> So the prophet appeals to experience. As the Psalmist confidently invites to ‘taste and see that God is good,’ so Jeremiah boldly bids the apostates know and see that departing is bitter.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> It is so, for it leaves the soul unsatisfied.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> It leads to remorse.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> It drags after it manifold bitter fruits. ‘The wages of sin is death.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Sin without consequent sorrow is an impossibility if there is a God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">IV. The loving appeal.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>The text is not denunciation, but tender, though indignant, pleading, in hope of winning back the wanderers. The prophet has just been pointing to the sorrowful results which necessarily follow on the nation’s apostasy, and tells Israel that its own wickedness shall correct it, and then, in the text, he beseeches them not to be blind to the meaning of their miseries, but to let these teach them how sinful and how sorrowful their apostasy is. Men’s sorrows are a mystery, but that sinners should not have sorrows were a sadder mystery still. And God pleads with us all not to lose the good of our experiences of the bitterness of sin by our levity or our blindness to their meaning. By His providences, by His Spirit working on us, by the plain teachings and loving pleadings of His word, He is ever striving to open our eyes that we may see Good and Evil, and recognise that all Good is bound up for us with cleaving to God, and all Evil with departing from Him. When we turn our backs on Him we are full front with the deformed figure of Evil; when we turn away from it, we are face to face with Him, and in Him, with all Good.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/jeremiah/2-19.htm" title="Your own wickedness shall correct you, and your backslidings shall reprove you: know therefore and see that it is an evil thing and bitter, that you have forsaken the LORD your God, and that my fear is not in you, said the Lord GOD of hosts.">Jeremiah 2:19</a></span>. <span class="ital">Thy own wickedness shall correct thee </span>— The miseries that your own sins have brought upon you, one would suppose, might be sufficient to reclaim you from your evil courses, and induce you to return to God, by a sincere repentance, <a href="/hosea/2-7.htm" title="And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them; and she shall seek them, but shall not find them: then shall she say, I will go and return to my first husband; for then was it better with me than now.">Hosea 2:7</a>. <span class="ital">Know therefore </span>— Upon the whole matter; <span class="ital">and see that it is an evil thing that thou hast forsaken the Lord thy God </span>— For that is the thing that makes thine enemies, enemies indeed, and thy friends, friends in vain.

For the people in its successive and even yet future generations constitutes a unity, and in this unity a moral personality. Since the sins of the fathers transmit themselves to the children and remoter descendants, sons and grandsons must pay the penalty of the fathers' guilt, that is, so long as they share the disposition of their ancestors. The conception of this moral unity is at the foundation of the threatening. That the present race persists in the fathers' backsliding from the Lord is clearly expressed in <a href="/jeremiah/2-17.htm">Jeremiah 2:17</a>. In "I will further chide or strive," is intimated implicite that God had chidden already up till now, or even earlier with the fathers. &#1512;&#1497;&#1489;, contend, when said of God, is actual striving or chastening with all kinds of punishment. This must God do as the righteous and holy one; for the sin of the people is an unheard of sin, seen in no other people. "The islands of the Chittim" are the isles and coast lands of the far west, as in <a href="/ezekiel/27-6.htm">Ezekiel 27:6</a>; &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; having originally been the name for Cyprus and the city of Cition, see in <a href="/genesis/10-4.htm">Genesis 10:4</a>. In contrast with these distant western lands, Kedar is mentioned as representative of the races of the east. The Kedarenes lived as a pastoral people in the eastern part of the desert between Arabia Petraea and Babylonia; see in <a href="/genesis/25-13.htm">Genesis 25:13</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/27-21.htm">Ezekiel 27:21</a>.

Ew. 324, c. The unheard of, that which has happened amongst no people, is put interrogatively for rhetorical effect. Has any heathen nation changed its gods, which indeed are not truly gods? No; no heathen nation has done this; but the people of Jahveh, Israel, has exchanged its glory, i.e., the God who made Himself known to it in His glory, for false gods that are of no profit. &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491; is the glory in which the invisible God manifested His majesty in the world and amidst His people. Cf. the analogous title given to God, ,&#1504;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1503;  &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500; <a href="/amos/8-7.htm">Amos 8:7</a>; <a href="/hosea/5-5.htm">Hosea 5:5</a>. The exact antithesis to &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491;&#1493; would be &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;, cf. <a href="/jeremiah/3-24.htm">Jeremiah 3:24</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/11-13.htm">Jeremiah 11:13</a>; but Jeremiah chose  &#1500;&#1488;to represent the exchange as not advantageous. God showed His glory to the Israelites in the glorious deeds of His omnipotence and grace, like those mentioned in <a href="/jeremiah/2-5.htm">Jeremiah 2:5</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/2-6.htm">Jeremiah 2:6</a>. The Baals, on the other hand, are not  &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501;, but, &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; nothings, phantoms without a being, that bring no help or profit to their worshippers. Before the sin of Israel is more fully set forth, the prophet calls on heaven to be appalled at it. The heavens are addressed as that part of the creation where the glory of God is most brightly reflected. The rhetorical aim is seen in the piling up of words. &#1495;&#1512;&#1489;, lit., to be parched up, to be deprived of the life-marrow. Israel has committed two crimes: a. It has forsaken Jahveh, the fountain of living water.  ,&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;living water, i.e., water that originates and nourishes life, is a significant figure for God, with whom is the fountain of life (<a href="/psalms/36-10.htm">Psalm 36:10</a>), i.e., from whose Spirit all life comes. Fountain of living water (here and <a href="/jeremiah/17-13.htm">Jeremiah 17:13</a>) is synonymous with well of life in <a href="/proverbs/10-11.htm">Proverbs 10:11</a>; <a href="/proverbs/13-14.htm">Proverbs 13:14</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/14-27.htm">Proverbs 14:27</a>, Sir. 21:13. b. The other sin is this, that they hew or dig out wells, broken, rent, full of crevices, that hold no water. The delineation keeps to the same figure. The dead gods have no life and can dispense no life, just as wells with rents or fissures hold no water. The two sins, the forsaking of the living God and the seeking out of dead gods, cannot really be separated. Man, created by God and for God, cannot live without God. If he forsake the living God, he passes in spite of himself into the service of dead, unreal gods. Forsaking the living God is eo ipso exchanging Him for an imaginary god. The prophet sets the two moments of the apostasy from God side by side, so as to depict to the people with greater fulness of light the enormity of their crime. The fact in <a href="/jeremiah/2-11.htm">Jeremiah 2:11</a> that no heathen nation changes its gods for others, has its foundation in this, that the gods of the heathen are the creations of men, and that the worship of them is moulded by the carnal-mindedness of sinful man; so that there is less inducement to change, the gods of the different nations being in nature alike. But the true God claims to be worshipped in spirit and in truth, and does not permit the nature and manner of His worship to depend on the fancies of His worshippers; He makes demands upon men that run counter to carnal nature, insisting upon the renunciation of sensual lusts and cravings and the crucifixion of the flesh, and against this corrupt carnal nature rebels. Upon this reason for the fact adduced, Jeremiah does not dwell, but lays stress on the fact itself. This he does with the view of bringing out the distinction, wide as heaven, between the true God and the false gods, to the shaming of the idolatrous people; and in order, at the same time, to scourge the folly of idolatry by giving prominence to the contrast between the glory of God and the nothingness of the idols. </body></html>
