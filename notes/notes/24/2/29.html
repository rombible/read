Here is the language of presumptuous sinners. The Jews had long thrown off serious thoughts of God. How many days of our lives pass without suitable remembrance of him! The Lord was displeased with their confidences, and would not prosper them therein. Men employ all their ingenuity, but cannot find happiness in the way of sin, or excuse for it.

This plea Jeremiah meets by pointing to the open practising of idolatrous worship. The people of Judah personified as a woman - &#1494;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492; in <a href="/jeremiah/2-20.htm">Jeremiah 2:20</a> - is addressed. &#1488;&#1497;&#1498; is a question expressing astonishment. &#1504;&#1491;&#1502;&#1488;&#1514;&#1497;, of defilement by idolatry, as is shown by the next explanatory clause: the Baals I have not followed. &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; is used generically for strange gods, <a href="/jeremiah/1-16.htm">Jeremiah 1:16</a>. The public worship of Baal had been practised in the kingdom of Judah under Joram, Ahaziah, and Athaliah only, and had been extirpated by Jehu, <a href="/2_kings/10-18.htm">2 Kings 10:18</a>. Idolatry became again rampant under Ahaz (by his instigation), Manasseh, and Amon, and in the first year of Josiah's reign. Josiah began to restore the worship of Jahveh in the twelfth year of his reign; but it was not till the eighteenth that he was able to complete the reformation of the public services. There is then no difficulty in the way of our assuming that there was yet public worship of idols in Judah during the first five years of Jeremiah's labours. We must not, however, refer the prophet's words to this alone. The following of Baal by the people was not put an end to when the altars and images were demolished; for this was sufficient neither to banish from the hearts of the people the proneness to idolatry, nor utterly to suppress the secret practising of it. The answer to the protestation of the people, blinded in self-righteousness, shows, further, that the grosser publicly practised forms had not yet disappeared. "See thy way in the valley." Way, i.e., doing and practising. &#1489;&#1468;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1488; with the article must be some valley known for superstitions cultivated there; most commentators suggest rightly the valley of Ben or Bne-Hinnom to the south of Jerusalem, where children were offered to Moloch; see on <a href="/jeremiah/7-31.htm">Jeremiah 7:31</a>. The next words, "and know what thou hast done," do not, taken by themselves, imply that this form of idol-worship was yet to be met with, but only that the people had not yet purified themselves from it. If, however, we take them in connection with what follows, they certainly do imply the continued existence of practices of that sort. The prophet remonstrates with the people for its passionate devotion to idolatry by comparing it to irrational animals, which in their season of heat yield themselves to their instinct. The comparison gains in pointedness by his addressing the people as a camel-filly and a wild she-ass. '&#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1512;&#1492;  is vocative, co-ordinate with the subject of address, and means the young filly of the camel. &#1511;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;, running lightly, nimbly, swiftly. '&#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1499;&#1514;  &#1491;&#1512;, intertwining, i.e., crossing her says; rushing right and left on the paths during the season of heat. Thus Israel ran now after one god, now after another, deviating to the right and to the left from the path prescribed by the law, <a href="/deuteronomy/28-14.htm">Deuteronomy 28:14</a>. To delineate yet more sharply the unruly passionateness with which the people rioted in idolatry, there is added the figure of a wild ass running herself weary in her heat. Hitz. holds the comparison to be so managed that the figure of the she-camel is adhered to, and that this creature is compared to a wild ass only in respect of its panting for air. But this view could be well founded only if the Keri &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;&#1468; were the original reading. Then we might read the words thus: (like) a wild ass used to the wilderness she (the she-camel) pants in the heat of her soul for air. But this is incompatible with the Cheth. &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;, since the suffix points back to &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492;, and requires &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493; to be joined with '&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492; &#1500;, so that  &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1508;&#1492; must be spoken of the latter. Besides, taken on its own account, it is a very unnatural hypothesis that the behaviour of the she-camel should be itself compared to the gasping of the wild ass for breath; for the camel is only a figure of the people, and <a href="/jeremiah/2-24.htm">Jeremiah 2:24</a> is meant to exhibit the unbridled ardour, not of the camel, but of the people. So that with the rest of the comm. we take the wild ass to be a second figure for the people. &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492; differs only orthographically from &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;, the usual form of the word, and which many codd. have here. This is the wood ass, or rather wild ass, since the creature lives on steppes, not in woods. It is of a yellowish colour, with a white belly, and forms a kind of link between the deer species and the ass; by reason of its arrow-like speed not easily caught, and untameable. Thus it is used as an emblem of boundless love of freedom, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/16-12.htm">Genesis 16:12</a>, and of unbridled licentiousness, see on <a href="/job/24-5.htm">Job 24:5</a> and <a href="/job/39-5.htm">Job 39:5</a>. &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492;as nom. epicaen. has the adj. next it, &#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1491; ,ti t, in the masc., and so too in the apposition &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;; the fem. appears first in the statement as to its behaviour, &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1508;&#1492;: she pants for air to cool the glow of heat within. &#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1504;&#1492; sig. neither copulation, from &#1488;&#1504;&#1492;, approach (Dietr.), nor aestus libidinosus (Schroed., Ros.). The sig. approach, meet, attributed to &#1488;&#1504;&#1492;, Dietr. grounds upon the Ags. gelimpan, to be convenient, opportune; and the sig. slow is derived from the fact that Arab. &#768;ny is used of the boiling of water. The root meaning of &#1488;&#1504;&#1492;, Arab. &#768;ny, is, according to Fleischer, tempestivus fuit, and the root indicates generally any effort after the attainment of the aim of a thing, or impulse; from which come all the meanings ascribed to the word, and for &#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1504;&#1492; in the text before us the sig. heat, i.e., the animal instinct impelling to the satisfaction of sexual cravings.</body></html>
