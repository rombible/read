The world is, to those who make it their home and their portion, a wilderness and a land of darkness; but those who dwell in God, have the lines fallen to them in pleasant places. Here is the language of presumptuous sinners. The Jews had long thrown off serious thoughts of God. How many days of our lives pass without suitable remembrance of him! The Lord was displeased with their confidences, and would not prosper them therein. Men employ all their ingenuity, but cannot find happiness in the way of sin, or excuse for it.

Take notice of it, consider it; or, hear it, as the Septuagint, Syriac, and Arabic versions. Jarchi and Kimchi think (i) the pot of manna was brought out, and shown them, to be looked at by them, for the conviction of them, and confirmation of what follows: <p>have I been a wilderness unto Israel? no: the Israelites were plentifully supplied by him when in the wilderness, and since they were brought into a land flowing with milk and honey; so that they stood in need of nothing; they had a constant supply of all good things: <p>or a land of darkness? of misery, distress, and poverty; where no light of joy, comfort, and prosperity, is; a land that never sees the light, or enjoys the benefit of the sun, and so is barren and unfruitful; "a land of thorns", as the Septuagint version; or, "a desert and uncultivated land", as the Targum, and Syriac and Arabic versions. It may be rendered, "a land of the darkness of God" (k); that is, of the greatest darkness, of thick and gross darkness, alluding to that in Egypt; as the flame of God, and mountains of God, Sol 8:6, as Ben Melech and Kimchi observe: <p>wherefore say my people, we are lords; and can reign without thee; or we have kings and princes, and have no need of thee, so Kimchi; but the word used seems to have another meaning, and to require another sense. The Targum is, "we are removed"; and the Vulgate Latin version, "we have gone back"; to which agrees the Jewish Midrash (l), mentioned by Jarchi, and confirmed with a passage out of the Misna (m), "we are separated from thee"; we have departed from thee, turned our backs on thee, have forsaken thee, and left thy ways and worship; and to do so was very ungrateful, when the Lord had so richly supplied them, that they had not lacked any good thing; and this sense agrees with what follows: <p>we will come no more unto thee? some render it, "we have determined" (n); as having the same sense with the Arabic word, which signifies to "will" or determine anything; and then the meaning is, we are determined, we are resolved to come no more to thee, to attend thy worship and service any more; and so the Targum, <p>"we will not return any more to thy worship.'' <p>(i) So Mechilta apud Yalkut in loc.

It is doubtful whether <span class="accented">generation</span> here means "contemporaries" (equivalent to "men of this generation"), or, like <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f71;</span> sometimes in the New Testament, a class of men united by moral affinity (comp. <a href="/psalms/14-5.htm">Psalm 14:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/78-8.htm">Psalm 78:8</a>). In the latter case we should rather attach the pronoun in "see ye" <span class="accented">to</span> "O generation," and render "O (evil) generation that ye are!" So Hitzig, Keil, and Payne Smith; Ewald and Delitzsch adopt the first rendering. <span class="cmt_word">Have I been a wilderness</span>, etc.? "Have I not been the source of light and happiness to my people, and of all temporal blessings?" (comp. <a href="/jeremiah/2-6.htm">Jeremiah 2:6</a>). So the Divine speaker in <a href="/isaiah/45-19.htm">Isaiah 45:19</a>, "I said not unto the seed of Jacob, Seek ye me in vain," or more literally, "in chaos" (same word as in <a href="/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a>); "chaos" and "the wilderness" are both images of that which is utterly unremunerative. <span class="cmt_word">A land of darkness</span>. This is, of course, not literally accurate as a description of the Arabian desert. "Darkness" is here used as a synonym for "misery." Cloud and rain occupy precisely opposite places in the estimation of nomadic and agricultural peoples respectively. "The Bedouins," says an Arabic scholast, "always follow the rain and the places where raindrops fall;" whereas a townsman of Mecca calls himself "child of the sun." So Indra and Varuna, originally belonging to the cloudy and rainy sky, are in the Vedic hymns endowed with solar traits. It should be added here that it is an old problem, and too difficult a one for us to investigate, whether we should render "the darkness of Jah" (Jehovah) or (as Authorized Version) simply "darkness." The former rendering will mean very great darkness, such as Jehovah sends in judgment (e.g. to the Egyptians, <a href="/exodus/10-21.htm">Exodus 10:21-23</a>). On this question, see Dr. Ginsburg on <a href="/songs/8-6.htm">Song of Solomon 8:6</a> (where a similar doubt exists), Geiger's 'Urschrift und Uebersetzungen der Bibel,' p. 276; Ewald, 'Lehrbuch der Hebraischen Sprache,' &sect; 270 e. <span class="cmt_word">We are lords</span>; rather, <span class="accented">we have broken loose</span>.

Thus much is beyond all doubt, that the words are still a part of the figure, i.e., of the comparison between the idolatrous people and the wild ass.

B. Mich.), still less tempus menstruum (Jerome, etc.), but month; and the suffix in &#1492;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;&#1468; is to be referred, not with Hitz. to &#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1504;&#1514;&#1492;&#1468;, but to &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492;. The suffixes in &#1502;&#1489;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1492; and &#1497;&#1502;&#1510;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; absolutely demand this. "Her month" is the month appointed for the gratification of the wild ass's natural impulse, i.e., as Bochart rightly explains it (Hieroz. ii. p. 230, ed. Ros.) mensis quo solent sylvestres asinae maris appetitu fervere. The meaning of the comparison is this: the false gods do not need anxiously to court the favour of the people; in its unbridled desires it gives itself up to them; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/3-2.htm">Jeremiah 3:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/2-7.htm">Hosea 2:7</a>, <a href="/hosea/2-15.htm">Hosea 2:15</a>. With this is suitably coupled the warning of <a href="/jeremiah/2-25.htm">Jeremiah 2:25</a> : hold back, i.e., keep thy foot from getting bare (&#1497;&#1492;&#1507; is subst. not adjective, which would have had to be fem., since &#1512;&#1490;&#1500; is fem.), and thy throat from thirst, viz., by reason of the fever of running after the idols. This admonition God addresses by the prophet to the people. It is not to wear the sandals off its feet by running after amours, nor so to heat its throat as to become thirsty. Hitz. proposes unsuitably, because in the face of the context, to connect the going barefoot with the visiting of the sanctuary, and the thirsting of the throat (<a href="/1_kings/18-26.htm">1 Kings 18:26</a>) with incessant calling on the gods. The answer of the people to this admonition shows clearly that it has been receiving an advice against running after the gods. The Chet. &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;&#1512;&#1504;&#1498; is evidently a copyists's error for &#1493;&#1468;&#1490;&#1512;&#1493;&#1504;&#1498;. The people replies: &#1504;&#1493;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;, desperatum (est), i.e., hopeless; thy advice of all in vain; cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-12.htm">Jeremiah 18:12</a>, and on <a href="/isaiah/57-10.htm">Isaiah 57:10</a>. The meaning is made clearer by &#1500;&#1493;&#1488;: no; for I love the aliens, etc. &#1494;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; are not merely strange gods, but also strange peoples. Although idolatry is the matter chiefly in hand, yet it was so bound up with intriguing for the favour of the heathen nations that we cannot exclude from the words some reference to this also. </body></html>
