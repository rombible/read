That persistent national tendency surely compels us to recognise a divine inspiration as the source of the prophetic teaching and of the lofty spiritual theology of the Old Testament, which were in sharpest unlikeness and opposition to the whole trend of the people’s thoughts.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> It is this apostasy which is referred to here. The false gods made by men are the broken cisterns. But the text embodies a general truth.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. The irksomeness of a godless life.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>The contrast is between the springing fountain, there in the desert, with the lush green herbage round about, where a man has only to stoop and drink, and the painful hewing of cisterns.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> This emblem of the fountain beautifully suggests the great thought of God’s own loving will as the self-originated impulse by which He pours out all good. Apart from all our efforts, the precious gift is provided for us. Our relation is only that of receivers.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> We have the contrast with this in the laborious toils to which they condemn themselves who seek for created sources of good. ‘Hewn out cisterns’-think of a man who, with a fountain springing in his courtyard, should leave it and go to dig in the arid desert, or to hew the live rock in hopes to gain water. It was already springing and sparkling before him. The conduct of men, when they leave God and seek for other delights, is like digging a canal alongside a navigable river. They condemn themselves to a laborious and quite superfluous task. The true way to get is to take.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Illustrations in religion. Think of the toil and pains spent in idolatry and in corrupt forms of Christianity.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Illustrations in common life. Your toils-aye, and even your pleasures -how much of them is laboriously digging for the water which all the while is flowing at your side.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. The hopelessness of a godless life.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>The contrast further is between living waters and broken cisterns. God is the fountain of living waters; in other words, in fellowship with God there is full satisfaction for all the capacities and desires of the soul; heart-conscience-will-understanding-hope and fear.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The contrast of the empty cisterns. What a deep thought that with all their work men only make ‘cisterns,’ <span class="ital">i.e.</span> they only provide circumstances which <span class="ital">could hold</span> delights, but cannot secure that water should be in them! The men-made cisterns must be God-filled, if filled at all. The true joys from earthly things belong to him who has made God his portion.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Further, they are ‘broken cisterns,’ and all have in them some flaw or crack out of which the water runs. That is a vivid metaphor for the fragmentary satisfaction which all earthly good gives, leaving a deep yearning unstilled. And it is temporary as well as partial. ‘He that drinketh of this water shall thirst again’-nay, even as with those who indulge in intoxicating drinks, the appetite increases while the power of the draught to satisfy it diminishes. But the crack in the cistern points further to the uncertain tenure of all earthly goods and the certain leaving of them all.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> All godless life is a grand mistake.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">III. The crime of a godless life.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>It is right to seek for happiness. It is sin to go away from God. You are thereby not merely flinging away your chances, but are transgressing against your sacredest obligations. Our text is not only a remonstrance on the grounds of prudence, showing God-neglecting men that they are foolish, but it is an appeal to conscience, convincing them that they are sinful. God loves us and cares for us. We are bound to Him by ties which do not depend on our own volition. And so there is punishment for the sin, and the evils experienced in a godless life are penal as well as natural.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> We recall the New Testament modification of this metaphor, ‘The water that I shall give him shall be <span class="ital">in</span> him a fountain of water.’ Arabs in desert round dried-up springs. Hagar. Shipwrecked sailors on a reef. Christ opens ‘rivers in the wilderness and streams in the desert.’<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:9-13 Before God punishes sinners, he pleads with them, to bring them to repentance. He pleads with us, what we should plead with ourselves. Be afraid to think of the wrath and curse which will be the portion of those who throw themselves out of God's grace and favour. Grace in Christ is compared to water from a fountain, it being cooling and refreshing, cleansing and making fruitful: to living water, because it quickens dead sinners, revives drooping saints, supports and maintains spiritual life, and issues in eternal life, and is ever-flowing. To forsake this Fountain is the first evil; this is done when the people of God neglect his word and ordinances. They hewed them out broken cisterns, that could hold no water. Such are the world, and the things in it; such are the inventions of men when followed and depended on. Let us, with purpose of heart, cleave to the Lord only; whither else shall we go? How prone are we to forego the consolations of the Holy Spirit, for the worthless joys of the enthusiast and hypocrite!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The pagan are guilty of but one sin - idolatry; the covenant-people commit two - they abandon the true God; they serve idols.<p>Fountain - Not a spring or natural fountain, but a tank or reservoir dug in the ground (see <a href="/jeremiah/6-7.htm">Jeremiah 6:7</a>), and chiefly intended for storing living waters, i. e., those of springs and rivulets.

It is egregious folly to leave a fountain for a cistern, and especially a broken one: in a fountain the water is living, and always running, and ever springing up; not so in a cistern, and in a broken cistern there is none at all. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For my people have committed two evils; they have forsaken me <span class="cverse3">{t}</span> the fountain of living waters, <i>and</i> hewed out for themselves cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water.</span><p>(t) Signifying that when men forsake God's word, which is the fountain of life, they reject God himself, and so fall to their own inventions, and vain confidence, and procure to themselves destruction, Jon 2:8, Zec 10:2.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">13</span>. “Jehovah is a fountain of living water, having life in Himself, giving life to all.” (Co.)

They are "broken," like so many even of the best rock-hewn cisterns (Thomson, 'The Land and the Book,' p. 287).

He has brought them into a fruitful and well-cultivated land. &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1502;&#1500;, fruitful fields, the opposite of wilderness, <a href="/jeremiah/4-26.htm">Jeremiah 4:26</a>; <a href="/isaiah/29-17.htm">Isaiah 29:17</a>.

The priests, whom God had chosen to be the ministers of His sanctuary, asked not after Him, i.e., sought neither Him nor His sanctuary. They who occupy themselves with the law, who administer the law: these too are the priests as teachers of the law (<a href="/micah/3-11.htm">Micah 3:11</a>), who should instruct the people as to the Lord's claims on them and commandments (<a href="/leviticus/10-11.htm">Leviticus 10:11</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/33-10.htm">Deuteronomy 33:10</a>). They knew not Jahveh, i.e., they took no note of Him, did not seek to discover what His will and just claims were, so as to instruct the people therein, and press them to keep the law. The shepherds are the civil authorities, princes and kings (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/23-1.htm">Jeremiah 23:1</a>.): those who by their lives set the example to the people, fell away from the Lord; and the prophets, who should have preached God's word, prophesied &#1489;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;, by Baal, i.e., inspired by Baal. Baal is here a generic name for all false gods; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/23-13.htm">Jeremiah 23:13</a>. ,&#1500;&#1488;   those who profit not, are the Baals as unreal gods; cf. <a href="/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/12-21.htm">1 Samuel 12:21</a>. The utterances as to the various ranks form a climax, as Hitz. rightly remarks. The ministers of public worship manifested no desire towards me; those learned in the law took no knowledge of me, of my will, of the contents of the book of the law; the civil powers went the length of rising up against my law; and the prophets fairly fell away to false gods, took inspiration from Baal, the incarnation of the lying spirit. </body></html>
