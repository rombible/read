Or, in her last month, because they grow then unwieldy. That this creature sleeps one month in the year, and that is the month she may be taken, is generally deemed but a fancy.

That is, one that has been brought up in the wilderness, and has been accustomed to live, and run, and range about there; as men in general are compared to this creature for its ignorance, stupidity, folly, stubbornness, and unteachableness, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/11-12.htm">Job 11:12</a>, so the Jewish people are represented as like unto it, for its wantonness and lust: <p>that snuffeth up the wind at her pleasure; draws it in at her nostrils, and snuffs it up; or opens her mouth, and takes it in with her breath; drinks it in, and swallows it up at her pleasure: or, "with the desire of her soul" (c); it being grateful and delightful to her. Some read this clause in connection with  rendered "in her occasion"; and differently translate it. The Targum takes it to have the signification of  "dragons"; or whales; and renders it, <p>"drinking the wind as a dragon;'' <p>and so Jarchi, who compares it with <a href="/jeremiah/14-6.htm">Jeremiah 14:6</a> "they snuffed up the wind like dragons"; and so the Syriac version, "thou hast drawn up the wind like a wild dog"; others render it, "gathering the wind of her occasion"; or, "of her meeting" (d); taking it in, and snuffing it up, as she occasionally met with it in running. The Vulgate Latin version is, "she drew the wind of her love"; it is reported of the wild ass, that it can smell its mate afar off, and, by the wind it snuffs, knows where it is; for which purpose it runs up the hills and mountains to get the scent, which, when it has, its lust is so violent that there is no stopping of it till it comes to the place where its mate is: wherefore it follows, <p>in her occasion who can turn her away? when this violent fit is upon her, there is no turning her away from pursuing the enjoyment of it; which is expressive of the eager desire of the Jews after the worshipping of idols, how bent upon it, and not to be reclaimed from it: <p>all they that seek her will not weary themselves; knowing that they can not overtake her, or stop her in her career, or hinder her gratification of her lust. This may be understood either of those who sought to commit spiritual adultery or idolatry with the Jews, they need not weary themselves, being easy to be found by them; or of the prophets that sought to reclaim them, who, perceiving how stubborn, and untractable, and irreclaimable they were, would not weary themselves with their admonitions and reproofs, seeing they were in vain: <p>in her month they shall find her; not that this creature sleeps one whole month in a year, as Jarchi dreams, when it may be easily taken; but the sense is, that when it is with young, and in the last month, and so is heavy with its burden, it may easily be found and taken; so when the people of Israel should have filled up the measure of their iniquity, and the judgment of God was fallen and lay heavy upon them; then those that sought to return them from their evil ways might find them, and hope to succeed in reclaiming them, and bringing them to repentance; agreeably the Septuagint render it, "in her humiliation"; when chastised and humbled by the Lord for her sins. This is not to be understood of the month of Ab, in which Jerusalem was destroyed, both by Nebuchadnezzar and Titus; in which month the Jews are sure to be found confessing their sins, and humbling themselves, as Kimchi, Abarbinel, and Ben Melech interpret it; nor of the new moon, as others; at everyone of which, those who sought to join with them in idolatrous practices might be sure to find them at them. <p>(c)  "in, vel pro desiderio animae suae", Pagninus, Montanus, Junius &amp; Tremellius, Vatablus, Schmidt.

This thy forsaking of Jahveh makes or prepares for thee. &#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; is neuter; the infin. &#1506;&#1494;&#1489;&#1498; is the subject of the clause, and it is construed as a neuter, as in <a href="/1_samuel/18-23.htm">1 Samuel 18:23</a>. The fact that thou hast forsaken Jahveh thy God has brought this evil on thee. At the time when He led thee on the way. The participle &#1502;&#1493;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498; is subordinated to &#1506;&#1514; in the stat. constr. as a partic. standing for the praeterit. durans; cf. Ew. 337, c. &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; is understood by Ros. and Hitz. of the right way (<a href="/psalms/25-8.htm">Psalm 25:8</a>); but in this they forget that this acceptation is incompatible with the &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514;, which circumscribes the leading within a definite time. God will lead His people on the right way at all times. The way on which He led them at the particular time is the way through the Arabian desert, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-6.htm">Jeremiah 2:6</a>, and &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; is to be understood as in <a href="/deuteronomy/1-33.htm">Deuteronomy 1:33</a>; <a href="/exodus/18-8.htm">Exodus 18:8</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/23-20.htm">Exodus 23:20</a>, etc. Even thus early their fathers forsook the Lord: At Sinai, by the worship of the golden calf; then when the people rose against Moses and Aaron in the desert of Paran, called a rejecting (&#1504;&#1488;&#1509;) of Jahveh in <a href="/numbers/14-11.htm">Numbers 14:11</a>; and at Shittim, where Israel joined himself to Baal Peor, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/25-1.htm">Numbers 25:1-3</a>. The forsaking of Jahveh is not to be limited to direct idolatry, but comprehends also the seeking of help from the heathen; this is shown by the following 18th verse, in which the reproaches are extended to the present bearing of the people. ' &#1502;&#1492;&#1470;&#1500;&#1468;&#1498;  &#1500;&#1491;&#1512;&#1498;  &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;, lit., what is to thee in reference to the way of Egypt (for the expression, see <a href="/hosea/14-9.htm">Hosea 14:9</a>), i.e., what hast thou to do with the way of Egypt? Why dost thou arise to go into Egypt, to drink the water of the Nile? &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1493;&#1512;, the black, turbid stream, is a name for the Nile, taken from its dark-grey or black mud. The Nile is the life-giving artery of Egypt, on whose fertilizing waters the fruitfulness and the prosperity of the country depend. To drink the waters of the Nile is as much as to say to procure for oneself the sources of Egypt's life, to make the power of Egypt useful to oneself. Analogous to this is the drinking the waters of the river, i.e., the Euphrates. What is meant is seeking help from Egyptians and Assyrians. The water of the Nile and of the Euphrates was to be made to furnish them with that which the fountain of living water, i.e., Jahveh (<a href="/jeremiah/2-14.htm">Jeremiah 2:14</a>), supplied to them. This is an old sin, and with it Israel of the ten tribes is upbraided by Hosea (<a href="/hosea/7-11.htm">Hosea 7:11</a>; <a href="/hosea/12-2.htm">Hosea 12:2</a>). From this we are not to infer "that here we have nothing to do with the present, since the existing Israel, Judah, was surely no longer a suitor for the assistance of Assyria, already grown powerless" (Hitz.). The limitation of the reproach solely to the past is irreconcilable with the terms of the verse and with the context (<a href="/jeremiah/2-19.htm">Jeremiah 2:19</a>).  &#1502;&#1492;&#1470;&#1500;&#1468;&#1498; &#1500;&#1491;&#1512;&#1498;cannot grammatically be translated: What hadst thou to do with the way; just as little can we make &#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1505;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; hath chastised thee, since the following: know and see, is then utterly unsuitable to it. &#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1505;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; and &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1499;&#1497;&#1495;&#1498; are not futures, but imperfects, i.e., expressing what is wont to happen over again in each similar case; and so to be expressed in English by the present: thy wickedness, i.e., thy wicked work, chastises thee. The wickedness was shown in forsaking Jahveh, in the &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;, backslidings, the repeated defection from the living God; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/3-22.htm">Jeremiah 3:22</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/5-6.htm">Jeremiah 5:6</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/14-7.htm">Jeremiah 14:7</a>. As to the fact, we have no historical evidence that under Josiah political alliance with Egypt or Assyria was compassed; but even if no formal negotiations took place, the country was certainly even then not without a party to build its hopes on one or other of the great powers between which Judah lay, whenever a conflict arose with either of them. -  &#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1506;&#1497;, with the Vav of consecution (see Ew. 347, a): Know then, and at last comprehend, that forsaking the Lord thy God is evil and bitter, i.e., bears evil and bitter fruit, prepares bitter misery for thee. "To have no fear of me" corresponds "to forsake," lit., thy forsaking, as second subject; lit.,: and the no fear of me in thee, i.e., the fact that thou hast no awe of me. &#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1491;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;, awe of me, like &#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1491;&#1468;&#1498; in <a href="/deuteronomy/2-25.htm">Deuteronomy 2:25</a>. </body></html>
