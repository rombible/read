He is now taught that that work was throughout conditional. In bold anthropomorphic speech Jehovah represents himself as changing His purpose, even suddenly, “in an instant,” if the nation that is affected by it passes from evil to good or from good to evil. The seeming change is but the expression of an unchanged eternal Law of Righteousness, dealing with men according to their works. This, and not the assertion of an arbitrary, irresistibly predestinating will, was the lesson the prophet had been taught by the parable of the potter’s wheel.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/18.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/jeremiah/18-7.htm" title="At what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to destroy it;...">Jeremiah 18:7-8</a></span>. <span class="ital">At what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, </span>&c. — God speaks thus concerning nations and kingdoms in his word, and by his prophets and ministers.

The threatenings of God being conditional, when they are suspended by his long-suffering and mercy, or prevented by the amendment of the persons against whom they are denounced, he is said, in Scripture, to repent; not that the phrase implies that there is any change in him, but that there is a change in us; and that his conduct toward us, provided his denunciations were not conditional, is the same as if he repented or changed his mind. But the reader is desired to see what is said on this subject, <a href="/genesis/6-6.htm" title="And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.">Genesis 6:6</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/18.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>18:1-10 While Jeremiah looks upon the potter's work, God darts into his mind two great truths. God has authority, and power, to form and fashion kingdoms and nations as he pleases. He may dispose of us as he thinks fit; and it would be as absurd for us to dispute this, as for the clay to quarrel with the potter. But he always goes by fixed rules of justice and goodness. When God is coming against us in judgments, we may be sure it is for our sins; but sincere conversion from the evil of sin will prevent the evil of punishment, as to persons, and to families, and nations.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>At what instant - literally, "in a moment."
