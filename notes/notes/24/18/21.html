To what extent they were the utterances of a righteous indignation, a true zeal for God, which had not yet learnt the higher lesson of patience and forgiveness, or embodied an element of personal vindictiveness, we are not called on to inquire, and could not, in any case, decide. It is not ours to judge another man’s servant. In all like cases we have to remember that the very truthfulness with which the prayer is recorded is at least a proof that the prophet felt, like Jonah, that he did well to be angry (<a href="/jonah/4-9.htm" title="And God said to Jonah, Do you well to be angry for the gourd? And he said, I do well to be angry, even to death.">Jonah 4:9</a>), that a righteous anger is at least one step towards a righteous love, and that we, as disciples of Christ, have passed, or ought to have passed, beyond that earlier stage.<p><span class= "bld">Pour out their blood by the force of the sword.</span>—Literally, with a bolder metaphor, <span class= "ital">pour them out into the hands of the sword.</span><p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/18.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>18:18-23 When the prophet called to repentance, instead of obeying the call, the people devised devices against him.

So Eze 35:5. Maurer with Jerome translates, "deliver them over to the power of the sword." But compare Ps 63:10, Margin; Isa 53:12. In this prayer he does not indulge in personal revenge, as if it were his own cause that was at stake; but he speaks under the dictation of the Spirit, ceasing to intercede, and speaking prophetically, knowing they were doomed to destruction as reprobates; for those not so, he doubtless ceased not to intercede. We are not to draw an example from this, which is a special case.<p>put to death&#8212;or, as in Jer 15:2, "perish by the death plague" [Maurer].<p>men &#8230; young men&#8212;Horsley distinguishes the former as married men past middle age; the latter, the flower of unmarried youth.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Deliver up their children to the famine; </span> a dreadful imprecation; we meet with more of the same nature, <span class="bld"><a href="/jeremiah/11-20.htm" title="But, O LORD of hosts, that judge righteously, that try the reins and the heart, let me see your vengeance on them: for to you have I revealed my cause.">Jeremiah 11:20</a> 15:15 17:18</span>.

Hence a question is raised, whether it be lawful for God’s servants to pray for evil against their enemies. That which makes the doubt is, Christ’s command to us to <span class="ital">pray for them that persecute us</span>, <span class="bld"><a href="/matthew/5-43.htm" title="You have heard that it has been said, You shall love your neighbor, and hate your enemy.">Matthew 5:43</a>,44</span>, his own example, and Stephen’s, <span class="bld"><a href="/acts/7-60.htm" title="And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge.

It is doubtless our duty to pray for the <span class="ital">conversion, forgiveness, and eternal salvation</span> of our worst enemies; so Christ prayed, and Stephen, but neither of them prayed for their outward prosperity in their persecution and rage; and without doubt we may pray against God’s enemies, that God would tie their hands, weaken their power, confound their devices. For such other particulars as are mentioned in this verse, and the beginning of the following verse, and such as David mentions, <span class="bld">Psalm 69</span>, we must know they were both prophets, and did but pray to God to do that thing which God had revealed to them he would do. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/18.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Therefore deliver up their children to the famine,....

They burn odours, i.e., kindle sacrifices, to the vanity, i.e., the null gods, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/31-7.htm">Psalm 31:7</a>, i.e., to Baal, <a href="/jeremiah/7-9.htm">Jeremiah 7:9</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-13.htm">Jeremiah 11:13</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/11-17.htm">Jeremiah 11:17</a>. The subject to &#1497;&#1499;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; may be most simply supplied from the idea of "the vanity:" the null gods made them to stumble; cf. for this idea <a href="/2_chronicles/28-23.htm">2 Chronicles 28:23</a>. This seems more natural than to leave the subject indefinite, in which case the false prophets (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/23-27.htm">Jeremiah 23:27</a>) or the priests, or other seducers, would be the moving spirits. "The ancient paths" is apposition to "their ways:" upon their ways, the paths of the old time, i.e., not, however, the good old believing times, from whose ways the Israelites have but recently diverged. For &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501; never denotes the time not very long passed away, but always old, immemorial time, here specially the time of the patriarchs, who walked on the right paths of faithfulness to God, as in <a href="/jeremiah/6-16.htm">Jeremiah 6:16</a>. Hitz. and Graf have taken "the ancient paths" as subject: the old paths have made the Israelites to stumble on their ways, which gives a most unnatural idea, while the "paths of the earliest time" is weakened into "the example of their ancestors;" and besides, the parallelism is destroyed. As "by-paths" is defined by the apposition "a way not cast up," so is "on their ways" by "the ancient paths."

A way not cast up is one on which one cannot advance, reach the goal, or on which one suffers hurt and perishes. - In <a href="/jeremiah/18-16.htm">Jeremiah 18:16</a> the consequences of these doings are spoken of as having been wrought out by themselves, in order thus to bring out the God-ordained causal nexus between actions and their consequences.

In connection with &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; as expression of horror or amazement, Jeremiah elsewhere uses only &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1511;&#1492;, cf. <a href="/jeremiah/19-8.htm">Jeremiah 19:8</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-9.htm">Jeremiah 25:9</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/25-18.htm">Jeremiah 25:18</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/29-18.htm">Jeremiah 29:18</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-37.htm">Jeremiah 51:37</a>, so that here the vowelling should perhaps be &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511;&#1514;.
