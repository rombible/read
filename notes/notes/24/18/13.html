As to the first, Lebanon, it must be observed, was the highest mountain in Israel, lying to the north of it, and having its summit almost always covered with snow; from the whiteness of which it is supposed to have derived its name.” See <span class="ital">Ancient Univ. Hist. </span>vol. 1. book 1. p. 570, fol. The same circumstance is also recorded by Tacitus, <span class="ital">Hist. </span>lib. 5. c. 6. “Præcipuum montium Libanum erigit, mirum dictu, tantos inter ardores opacum fidumque nivibus.” If we follow the translation in our text, the sense is, It is as strange and unreasonable for men to forsake the true God for idols, as it would be for a thirsty traveller to forego the cold refreshing streams that come in his way, flowing from the melting snows of Lebanon, or the clear waters issuing from a pure spring, in order that he might drink of the stagnant waters of some muddy pool. But, it is to be observed, the words <span class="ital">a man, </span>and <span class="ital">which cometh, </span>are not in the Hebrew, but supplied by our translators, and considerably alter the sense, which literally is, <span class="ital">Will the snow of Lebanon cease from the rock of the field? </span>That is, <span class="ital">Will it cease to flow, </span>&c. And by <span class="ital">the rock of the field, </span>may be meant the rocks on the level ground on the very top of Lebanon; from which the snow, being melted, flowed down into the vales at the bottom of the mountain. <span class="ital">Or, shall the cold overflowing waters, running down, fail? </span>The Vulgate translates the verse to exactly the same sense, “Nunquid deficiet de petra agri nix Libani; aut evelli possunt aquæ erumpentes frigidæ, et defluentes?” And the LXX. to nearly that sense, <span class="greekheb">Μη εκλειψουσιν απο πετρας μασοι</span>, <span class="greekheb">η χιων απο του Λιβανου</span>; <span class="greekheb">μη εκκλινη υδωρ βιαιως ανεμω φερομενον</span>; <span class="ital">Shall the breasts </span>(that is, <span class="ital">the springs</span>) <span class="ital">fail from the rock, or snow from Lebanon? Shall water, borne along violently by the wind, turn aside? </span>The sense of the verse seems to be, that the Jews ought no more to have failed in their adherence to the true God, and his service, than the snow on mount Lebanon, or the waters which flow from that mountain into the fields under it, ever fail; in other words, That, as the works of nature preserve their order, and fail not of answering the ends for which they were appointed; so the Jews ought not to have failed of performing their duty to, and showing forth the praises of, Him who chose them to be his peculiar people, and conferred singular privileges upon them in order to these very ends.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/18.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>18:11-17 Sinners call it liberty to live at large; whereas for a man to be a slave to his lusts, is the very worst slavery. They forsook God for idols. When men are parched with heat, and meet with cooling, refreshing streams, they use them. In these things men will not leave a certainty for an uncertainty; but Israel left the ancient paths appointed by the Divine law. They walked not in the highway, in which they might travel safely, but in a way in which they must stumble: such was the way of idolatry, and such is the way of iniquity. This made their land desolate, and themselves miserable. Calamities may be borne, if God smile upon us when under them; but if he is displeased, and refuses his help, we are undone. Multitudes forget the Lord and his Christ, and wander from the ancient paths, to walk in ways of their own devising.

This passage is unusually obscure. Literally we must, it would seem, render, <span class="accented">Doth the snow of Lebanon fail from the rock of the field</span> (or possibly, <span class="accented">cease to flow from the rock unto the field</span>)? This is explained as pointing a contrast to the infidelity of God's people. "The snow never leaves the summit of Lebanon; the waters which take their rise therein never dry up; but my people have forgotten the law of their being, the source of their prosperity." The rendering of the first clause is, however, grammatically dubious (there is no example of this construction of '<span class="accented">azabh</span>), and all the old versions point to (or at least favor) a reading, <span class="accented">Shaddai</span> (the Almighty) instead of <span class="accented">sadai</span> (the field). If we keep the text, we must explain "the rock of the field" on the analogy of "my mountain in the field" (<a href="/jeremiah/17-3.htm">Jeremiah 17:3</a>), as meaning "the rock which commands a wide prospect over the open lowland country," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Mount Lebanon. <span class="cmt_word">The cold flowing waters</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the numerous "streams from Lebanon," referred to in <a href="/songs/4-15.htm">Song of Solomon 4:15</a>. <span class="cmt_word">That come from another place;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> whoso sources are foreign. But as this does not suit the connection, it is better to take the Hebrew word (<span class="accented">zarim</span>), usually rendered "foreign," in the sense of "pressing or hurrying along," with Ewald, Graf, and virtually Henderson. It thus becomes descriptive of these streams "as contracted within narrow channels while descending through the gorges and defiles of the <span class="accented">rocks</span>." Camp. "like an oppressing stream," <a href="/isaiah/59-19.htm">Isaiah 59:19</a> (a cognate verb). <span class="cmt_word">Be forsaken</span>.

The power the potter has over the clay to remould, according to his pleasure, the vessel he had formed from it if it went wrong; the same power God possesses over the people of Israel. This unlimited power of God over mankind is exercised according to man's conduct, not according to a decretum absolutum or unchangeable determination. If he pronounces a people's overthrow or ruin, and if that people turn from its wickedness, He repeals His decree (<a href="/jeremiah/18-7.htm">Jeremiah 18:7</a>.); and conversely, if He promises a people welfare and prosperity, and if that people turn away from Him to wickedness, then too He changes His resolve to do good to it (<a href="/jeremiah/18-9.htm">Jeremiah 18:9</a>.). Inasmuch as He is even now making His decree known by the mouth of the prophet, it follows that the accomplishment of Jeremiah's last utterances is conditioned by the impression God's word makes on men. &#1512;&#1490;&#1506;, adv., in the moment, forthwith, and when repeated  equals  now...now, now...again. Ng. maintains that the arrangement here is paratactic, so that the &#1512;&#1490;&#1506;  does not belong to the nearest verb, but to the main idea, i.e., to the apodosis in this case. The remark is just; but the word does not mean suddenly, but immediately, and the sense is: when I have spoken against a people, and this people repents, then immediately I let it repent me. &#1504;&#1495;&#1501; &#1506;&#1500; as in <a href="//biblehub.com/joel/2-13.htm">Joel 2:13</a>, etc. With "to pluck up," etc., "to build," etc., cf. <a href="/jeremiah/1-10.htm">Jeremiah 1:10</a>.
