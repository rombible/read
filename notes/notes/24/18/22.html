Ew. wrongly translates: that my people forgot me. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; means for; and the causal import is founded on the main idea of <a href="/jeremiah/18-13.htm">Jeremiah 18:13</a> : A very horrible thing hath Israel done; for it hath done that which is unheard of in the natural world, it hath forsaken me, the rock of safety; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/2-32.htm">Jeremiah 2:32</a>. They burn odours, i.e., kindle sacrifices, to the vanity, i.e., the null gods, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/31-7.htm">Psalm 31:7</a>, i.e., to Baal, <a href="/jeremiah/7-9.htm">Jeremiah 7:9</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-13.htm">Jeremiah 11:13</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/11-17.htm">Jeremiah 11:17</a>. The subject to &#1497;&#1499;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; may be most simply supplied from the idea of "the vanity:" the null gods made them to stumble; cf. for this idea <a href="/2_chronicles/28-23.htm">2 Chronicles 28:23</a>. This seems more natural than to leave the subject indefinite, in which case the false prophets (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/23-27.htm">Jeremiah 23:27</a>) or the priests, or other seducers, would be the moving spirits. "The ancient paths" is apposition to "their ways:" upon their ways, the paths of the old time, i.e., not, however, the good old believing times, from whose ways the Israelites have but recently diverged. For &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501; never denotes the time not very long passed away, but always old, immemorial time, here specially the time of the patriarchs, who walked on the right paths of faithfulness to God, as in <a href="/jeremiah/6-16.htm">Jeremiah 6:16</a>. Hitz. and Graf have taken "the ancient paths" as subject: the old paths have made the Israelites to stumble on their ways, which gives a most unnatural idea, while the "paths of the earliest time" is weakened into "the example of their ancestors;" and besides, the parallelism is destroyed. As "by-paths" is defined by the apposition "a way not cast up," so is "on their ways" by "the ancient paths." The Chet. &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497; is found only here; the Keri is formed after <a href="/psalms/77-20.htm">Psalm 77:20</a>. A way not cast up is one on which one cannot advance, reach the goal, or on which one suffers hurt and perishes. - In <a href="/jeremiah/18-16.htm">Jeremiah 18:16</a> the consequences of these doings are spoken of as having been wrought out by themselves, in order thus to bring out the God-ordained causal nexus between actions and their consequences. To make their land an object of horror to all that set foot on it. &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511;&#1493;&#1514; occurs only here, while the Keri &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1511;&#1493;&#1514; is found only in <a href="/judges/5-16.htm">Judges 5:16</a> for the piping of shepherds, from &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1511;, to hiss, to pipe. In connection with &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; as expression of horror or amazement, Jeremiah elsewhere uses only &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1511;&#1492;, cf. <a href="/jeremiah/19-8.htm">Jeremiah 19:8</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-9.htm">Jeremiah 25:9</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/25-18.htm">Jeremiah 25:18</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/29-18.htm">Jeremiah 29:18</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-37.htm">Jeremiah 51:37</a>, so that here the vowelling should perhaps be &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511;&#1514;. The word does not here denote the hissing  equals  hissing down or against one, by way of contempt, but the sound midway between hissing and whistling which escapes one when one looks on something appalling. On "every one that passeth by shall be dismayed," cf. <a href="/1_kings/9-8.htm">1 Kings 9:8</a>. &#1492;&#1504;&#1497;&#1506; &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493; only here  equals  &#1492;&#1504;&#1497;&#1506; &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;, to move the head to and fro, shake the head; a gesture of malicious amazement, cf. <a href="/psalms/22-8.htm">Psalm 22:8</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/109-25.htm">Psalm 109:25</a>, like &#1502;&#1504;&#1493;&#1491; &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;, <a href="/psalms/44-15.htm">Psalm 44:15</a>. - In <a href="/jeremiah/18-17.htm">Jeremiah 18:17</a> the Lord discloses the coming punishment. Like an east wind, i.e., a violent storm-wind (cf. <a href="/psalms/48-8.htm">Psalm 48:8</a>), will I scatter them, cf. <a href="/jeremiah/13-24.htm">Jeremiah 13:24</a>. Because they have turned to Him the back and not the face (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/2-27.htm">Jeremiah 2:27</a>), so will He turn His back on them in the day of their ruin, cf. <a href="/ezekiel/35-5.htm">Ezekiel 35:5</a>. </body></html>
