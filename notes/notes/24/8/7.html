The birds of the air obey their instincts as the law of their nature. Israel, with its fatal gift of freedom, resists that which is its law of life.

The Hebrew name, <span class= "ital">chasideh </span>(literally, <span class= "ital">the pious bird</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>indicating its care for its young, is suggestive, as also is the phrase “in the heavens,” as applied to its characteristic mode of flight.

The people would not attend to reason; they would not act in the affairs of their souls with common prudence. Sin is backsliding; it is going back from the way that leads to life, to that which leads to destruction. 2. They would not attend to the warning of conscience. They did not take the first step towards repentance: true repentance begins in serious inquiry as to what we have done, from conviction that we have done amiss. 3. They would not attend to the ways of providence, nor understand the voice of God in them, ver. 7. They know not how to improve the seasons of grace, which God affords. Many boast of their religious knowledge, yet, unless taught by the Spirit of God, the instinct of brutes is a more sure guide than their supposed wisdom. 4. They would not attend to the written word. Many enjoy abundance of the means of grace, have Bibles and ministers, but they have them in vain. They will soon be ashamed of their devices. The pretenders to wisdom were the priests and the false prophets. They flattered people in sin, and so flattered them into destruction, silencing their fears and complaints with, All is well.

Of going and returning; for this is a bird of passage, as Pliny (d) and other naturalists observe; which goes away as winter approaches, and returns when that is over. The temperature of the air, as to heat and cold, and the natural propensity of such birds of passage to breed their young, are thought to be the incentives to change their habitation; and wonderful thing it is in nature, that they should know the proper time of their passage, what places to go to, and how to steer their course thither; and, as the above naturalist observes, they go and come in the night: <p>and the turtle, and the crane, and the swallow, observe the time of their coming: for these also are birds of passage; the turtle is absent in the winter, and its coming is a sign of spring, Sol 2:11, the crane, according to Aelianus (e), goes away with the stork, and returns when winter is over; and the same is observable of the swallow; hence the common saying, one swallow does not make spring; so Horace (f) uses "hirundine prima" for the beginning of spring. Where these birds retire to is not known; some think the swallows fly into Egypt and Ethiopia; but Olaus Magnus (g) says they lurk in holes, and even under water, where they hang together, and are sometimes drawn out in clusters, and being brought to the fire, and thawed, will revive and fly about. <p>But my people know not the judgment of the Lord; meaning not the unsearchable judgments of God, or those providential dispensations of God which are a great deep, and are not clearly discerned and known by the best of men; but either his own judgments, which are inflicted upon wicked men as punishments for sin, which yet are not taken notice of, and duly attended to, as they should be; or rather the law of God, and his revealed word, which is the rule of judgment and justice, and a declaration of righteousness, showing what is just and good, and ought to be done, which they were willingly ignorant of; or else the final and future judgment of God after death, to which all men must come, and into which every thought, word, and work, will be brought, and which day wicked men put far from them; see <a href="/isaiah/1-3.htm">Isaiah 1:3</a>. <p>(d) Nat.

These birds are again mentioned together in <a href="/isaiah/38-14.htm">Isaiah 38:14</a> (the psalm of Hezekiah), where special reference is made to the penetrating quality of their note. "The whooping or trumpeting of the crane rings through the night air in spring, and the vast flocks which we noticed passing north near Beersheba were a wonderful sight." The introduction of the swallow in the Authorized Version is misleading, as that bird is not a regular migrant in Palestine. The note of the swift is a shrill scream. "No bird is more conspicuous by the suddenness of its return than the swift," is the remark of Canon Tristram, who saw large flocks passing northwards over Jerusalem, on the 12th of February ('Nat. Hist. of Bible,' p. 208). It is an interesting fact that the swift bears the same name (<span class="accented">sus</span>) in the vernacular Arabic as in the Hebrew of Jeremiah. <span class="cmt_word">The judgment</span>; better, <span class="accented">the law</span> (see on Jeremiah 5:4). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>But even then the judgment has not come to a height.

The Masoretes wished to have the &#1493; before &#1497;&#1493;&#1510;&#1497;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; deleted, apparently because they took it for &#1493; consec. But it here stands before the jussive, as it does frequently, e.g., <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-10.htm">Jeremiah 13:10</a>, <a href="/exodus/12-3.htm">Exodus 12:3</a>. They will take the bones of the kings, princes, priests, and prophets, the rulers and leaders of the people (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/2-26.htm">Jeremiah 2:26</a>), and the bones of the other inhabitants of Jerusalem, out of their graves, and spread them out before the sun, the moon, and the stars, i.e., expose them under the open sky to the influence of the heavenly bodies, so that they shall rot away, become "dung on the face of the earth." The worst dishonour that could be done to the dead, a just return in kind for their worship of sun, moon, and stars: cf. <a href="/exodus/7-18.htm">Exodus 7:18</a>; <a href="/2_kings/21-5.htm">2 Kings 21:5</a>; <a href="/2_kings/23-11.htm">2 Kings 23:11</a>. This worship the prophet describes in its various stages: "Inclination of the heart, the act of devoting and dedicating themselves to the service, the frequenting of gods' sanctuary in order to worship and to obtain oracles; while he strives to bring out in strong relief the contrast between the zeal of their service and the reward they get by it" (Hitz.). They shall not be gathered, i.e., for burial: cf. <a href="/2_samuel/21-13.htm">2 Samuel 21:13</a>.; <a href="/1_samuel/31-13.htm">1 Samuel 31:13</a>. The dead shall suffer this at the hands of enemies despoiling the land. The reason for so doing was, as Jerome observes, the practice of burying ornaments and articles of value along with the dead. Seeking for such things, enemies will turn up the graves (cf. acts of this kind the case of Ibn Chaldun, in Sylv. de Sacy, Abdollat. p. 561), and, in their hatred and insolence, scatter the bones of the dead all about. </body></html>
