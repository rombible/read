Not even the dead should sleep in peace.

The motives of this desecration of the sepulchres might be either the wanton ferocity of barbarian conquerors, bent, after the manner of savage warfare, on the mutilation of the dead, or the greed of gain and the expectation of finding concealed treasures. So Hyrcanus, to the great scandal of the Jews, broke open the sepulchre of David (Joseph., <span class= "ital">Ant. </span>vii. 15).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/8.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/jeremiah/8-1.htm" title="At that time, said the LORD, they shall bring out the bones of the kings of Judah, and the bones of his princes, and the bones of the priests, and the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, out of their graves:...">Jeremiah 8:1-2</a></span>. <span class="ital">At that time, </span>&c. — The first three verses of this chapter properly belong to the preceding, and ought not to have been separated from it. <span class="ital">They shall bring out the bones of the kings of Judah </span>— “The Chaldeans shall regard neither the living nor the dead.

And afterward Herod the Great opened another cell, out of which he also took considerable wealth.

According to some, the motive of this invasion of the chambers of the dead is avarice (comp. Herod., 1:187, Darius at the tomb of Nitocris); but the context, without excluding this view, rather suggests malice and contempt.

And death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue which is left of this evil race, in all the places whither I have driven them that are left, saith Jahveh of hosts."<p>In these verses the judgment of <a href="/jeremiah/7-20.htm">Jeremiah 7:20</a> is depicted in all its horror, and the description is introduced by a call upon Zion to mourn and lament for the evil awaiting Jerusalem and the whole land. It is not any particular woman that is addressed in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-29.htm">Jeremiah 7:29</a>, but the daughter of Zion (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/6-23.htm">Jeremiah 6:23</a>), i.e., the capital city personified as a woman, as the mother of the whole people. Cut off &#1504;&#1494;&#1512;&#1498;, thy diadem. There can be no doubt that we are by this to understand the hair of the woman; but the current opinion, that the words simply and directly means the hair, is without foundation. It means crown, originally the diadem of the high priest, <a href="/exodus/29-6.htm">Exodus 29:6</a>; and the transference of the same word to the hair of the head is explained by the practice of the Nazarites, to wear the hair uncut as a mark of consecration to the Lord, <a href="/numbers/6-5.htm">Numbers 6:5</a>. The hair of the Nazarite is called in <a href="/numbers/6-7.htm">Numbers 6:7</a> the consecration (&#1504;&#1494;&#1512;) of his God upon his head, as was the anointing oil on the head of the high priest, <a href="/leviticus/21-12.htm">Leviticus 21:12</a>. In this sense the long hair of the daughter of Zion is called her diadem, to mark her out as a virgin consecrated to the Lord. Cutting off this hair is not only in token of mourning, as in <a href="/job/1-20.htm">Job 1:20</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/1-16.htm">Micah 1:16</a>, but in token of the loss of the consecrated character. The Nazarite, defiled by the sudden occurrence of death near to his person, was bound to cut off his long hair, because by this defilement his consecrated hair had been defiled; and just so must the daughter of Zion cut off her hair and cast it from her, because by her sins she had defiled herself, and must be held as unconsecrate. Venema and Ros. object to this reference of the idea to the consecrated hair of the Nazarite: quod huc non quadrat, nec in faeminis adeo suetum erat; but this objection is grounded on defective apprehension of the meaning of the Nazarite's vow, and on misunderstanding of the figurative style here employed. The allusion to the Nazarite order, for the purpose of representing the daughter of Zion as a virgin consecrated to the Lord, does not imply that the Nazarite vow was very common amongst women. Deprived of her holy ornament, Zion is to set up a lament upon bare hill-tops (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/3-21.htm">Jeremiah 3:21</a>), since the Lord has rejected or cast out (<a href="/jeremiah/7-30.htm">Jeremiah 7:30</a>) the generation that has drawn His wrath down on it, because they have set idols in the temple in which He has revealed His glory, to profane it. The abominations are the image of Asherah which Manasseh set up in the temple, and the altars he had built to the host of heaven in both the courts (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/21-5.htm">2 Kings 21:5</a>, <a href="/2_kings/21-7.htm">2 Kings 21:7</a>). Besides the desecration of the temple of the Lord by idolatry, Jeremiah mentions in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-31.htm">Jeremiah 7:31</a>, as an especially offensive abomination, the worship of Moloch practised in the valley of Benhinnom. Here children were burnt to this deity, to whom Manasseh had sacrificed his son, <a href="/2_kings/21-6.htm">2 Kings 21:6</a>. The expression "high altars of Tophet" is singular. In the parallel passages, where Jeremiah repeats the same subject, <a href="/jeremiah/19-5.htm">Jeremiah 19:5</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-35.htm">Jeremiah 32:35</a>, we find mentioned instead high altars of Baal; and on this ground, Hitz. and Graf hold &#1492;&#1514;&#1508;&#1514; in our verse to be a contemptuous name for Baal Moloch. &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1514; is not derived from the Persian; nor is it true that, as Hitz. asserts, it does not occur till after the beginning of the Assyrian period, since we have it in <a href="/job/17-6.htm">Job 17:6</a>. It is formed from &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507;, to spit out, like &#1504;&#1508;&#1514; from &#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507;; and means properly a spitting out, then that before or on which one spits (as in <a href="/job/17-6.htm">Job 17:6</a>), object of deepest abhorrence. It is transferred to the worship of Moloch here and <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-6.htm">Jeremiah 19:6</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/19-13.htm">Jeremiah 19:13</a>., and in <a href="/2_kings/23-10.htm">2 Kings 23:10</a>. In the latter passage the word is unquestionably used for the place in the valley of Benhinnom where children were offered to Moloch. So in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-6.htm">Jeremiah 19:6</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/19-13.htm">Jeremiah 19:13</a> (the place of Tophet), and <a href="/jeremiah/19-14.htm">Jeremiah 19:14</a>; and so also, without a doubt, in <a href="/jeremiah/7-32.htm">Jeremiah 7:32</a> of the present chapter. There is no valid reason for departing from this well-ascertained local signification; "high altars of the Tophet" may perfectly well be the high altars of the place of abominable sacrifices. With the article the word means the ill-famed seat of the Moloch-worship, situated in the valley of Ben or Bne Hinnom, to the south of Jerusalem. Hinnom is nomen propr. of a man of whom we know nothing else, and &#1489;&#1468;&#1503;( &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1501;) is not an appellative: son of sobbing, as Hitz., Graf, Bttcher explain (after Rashi), rendering the phrase by "Valley of the weepers," or "of groaning, sobbing," with reference to the cries of the children slain there for sacrifices. For the name Ben-hinnom is much older than the Moloch-worship, introduced first by Ahaz and Manasseh. We find it in <a href="/joshua/15-8.htm">Joshua 15:8</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/18-16.htm">Joshua 18:16</a>, in the topographical account of the boundaries of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin. As to Moloch-worship, see on <a href="/leviticus/18-21.htm">Leviticus 18:21</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/16-20.htm">Ezekiel 16:20</a>. At the restoration of the public worship of Jahveh, Josiah had extirpated Moloch-worship, and had caused the place of the sacrifice of abominations in the valley of Ben-hinnom to be defiled (<a href="/2_kings/23-20.htm">2 Kings 23:20</a>); so that it is hardly probable that it had been again restored immediately after Josiah's death, at the beginning of Jehoiakim's reign. Nor does the present passage imply this; for Jer. is not speaking of the forms of idolatry at that time in favour with the Jews, but of the abominations they had done. That he had Manasseh's doings especially in view, we may gather from <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-4.htm">Jeremiah 15:4</a>, where the coming calamities are expressly declared to be the punishment for Manasseh's sins. Neither is it come into my heart, i.e., into my mind, goes to strengthen: which I have not commanded.</body></html>
