It is not easy to identify the genus and species of the serpents of the Bible. Here the two words are in apposition. “Cockatrice,” however, cannot be right, that name belonging, as an English word, to legendary zoology. The Vulg. gives “basilisk.” In <a href="/proverbs/23-32.htm" title="At the last it bites like a serpent, and stings like an adder.">Proverbs 23:32</a> it is translated by “adder.” In any case it implies a hissing venomous snake (probably the <span class= "ital">cerastes </span>or <span class= "ital">serpens regulus</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>and the symbolism which identified it with the Assyrian or Chaldæan power had already appeared in <a href="/isaiah/14-29.htm" title="Rejoice not you, whole Palestina, because the rod of him that smote you is broken: for out of the serpent's root shall come forth a cockatrice, and his fruit shall be a fiery flying serpent.">Isaiah 14:29</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Which will not be charmed.</span>—The figure is that of <a href="/context/psalms/58-4.htm" title="Their poison is like the poison of a serpent: they are like the deaf adder that stops her ear;">Psalm 58:4-5</a>. The “deaf adder” that “refuseth to hear the voice of the charmer” represents an implacable enemy waging a pitiless war. Serpent-charming, as in the case of the Egyptian sorcerers (<a href="/exodus/7-11.htm" title="Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers: now the magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their enchantments.">Exodus 7:11</a>), seems to have been from a very early time, as it is now, both in Egypt and India, one of the most prominent features of the natural magic of the East.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/8.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/jeremiah/8-17.htm" title="For, behold, I will send serpents, cockatrices, among you, which will not be charmed, and they shall bite you, said the LORD.">Jeremiah 8:17</a></span>. <span class="ital">For behold, I send serpents, &c., which shall not be charmed </span>— Such enemies as you shall not be able to soften by any entreaties you can use. That some persons possessed the faculty of rendering serpents harmless, is a fact too well attested by historians and travellers to admit of contradiction: but by what means this effect was produced is not quite so clear. Pliny speaks of certain herbs which, being carried about, prevented the bite of serpents, <span class="ital">Nat. Hist., </span>lib. 20. sec. 16, lib. 22. sec. 25. Others tell surprising, but not altogether incredible stories, of the influence of musical sounds. See Shaw’s <span class="ital">Travels, </span>p. 429; and Sir John Chardin’s MS., cited by Harmer, chap. <a href="/jeremiah/8-14.htm" title="Why do we sit still? assemble yourselves, and let us enter into the defended cities, and let us be silent there: for the LORD our God has put us to silence, and given us water of gall to drink, because we have sinned against the LORD.">Jeremiah 8:14</a>. In this same MS. the author remarks, that “those who know how to tame serpents by their charms are wont commonly to break out their teeth; and supposes this to be alluded to, <a href="/psalms/58-6.htm" title="Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth: break out the great teeth of the young lions, O LORD.">Psalm 58:6</a>, <span class="ital">Break their teeth, O God, in their mouths.” </span>But whatever were the methods commonly practised to charm serpents, the enemies of the Jews are here compared to such serpents as were not to be mollified nor disarmed by any of those means. <span class="ital">They shall bite you, saith the Lord </span>— See Blaney, and note on <a href="/psalms/58-5.htm" title="Which will not listen to the voice of charmers, charming never so wisely.">Psalm 58:5</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:14-22 At length they begin to see the hand of God lifted up. And when God appears against us, every thing that is against us appears formidable. As salvation only can be found in the Lord, so the present moment should be seized. Is there no medicine proper for a sick and dying kingdom? Is there no skilful, faithful hand to apply the medicine? Yes, God is able to help and to heal them. If sinners die of their wounds, their blood is upon their own heads. The blood of Christ is balm in Gilead, his Spirit is the Physician there, all-sufficient; so that the people may be healed, but will not. Thus men die unpardoned and unchanged, for they will not come to Christ to be saved.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I will send - Or, am sending.

When the great calamity comes on the sin-hardened people, they shall be confounded and overwhelmed in ruin (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/6-11.htm">Jeremiah 6:11</a>). They spurn at the word of Jahveh; whose wisdom then have they? None; for the word of the Lord alone is Israel's wisdom and understanding, <a href="/deuteronomy/4-6.htm">Deuteronomy 4:6</a>.<p>The threatening in <a href="/jeremiah/8-10.htm">Jeremiah 8:10</a> includes not only the wise ones, but the whole people. "Therefore" attaches to the central truth of <a href="/jeremiah/8-5.htm">Jeremiah 8:5</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-6.htm">Jeremiah 8:6</a>, which has been elucidated in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-7.htm">Jeremiah 8:7-9</a>. The first half of <a href="/jeremiah/8-10.htm">Jeremiah 8:10</a> corresponds, in shorter compass, to what has been said in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-12.htm">Jeremiah 6:12</a>, and is here continued in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-10.htm">Jeremiah 8:10-12</a> in the same words as in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-13.htm">Jeremiah 6:13-15</a>. &#1497;&#1493;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; are those who take possession, make themselves masters of a thing, as in <a href="/jeremiah/49-2.htm">Jeremiah 49:2</a> and <a href="/micah/1-15.htm">Micah 1:15</a>. This repetition of the three verses is not given in the lxx, and Hitz. therefore proposes to delete them as a supplementary interpolation, holding that they are not only superfluous, but that they interrupt the sense. For he thinks <a href="/jeremiah/8-13.htm">Jeremiah 8:13</a> connects remarkably well with <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-10.htm">Jeremiah 8:10</a>, but, taken out of its connection with what precedes as we have it, begins baldly enough. To this Graf has made fitting answer: This passage is in no respect more superfluous or awkward than <a href="/jeremiah/6-13.htm">Jeremiah 6:13</a>.; nor is the connection of <a href="/jeremiah/8-13.htm">Jeremiah 8:13</a> with <a href="/jeremiah/8-10.htm">Jeremiah 8:10</a> at all closer than with <a href="/jeremiah/8-12.htm">Jeremiah 8:12</a>. And Hitz., in order to defend the immediate connection between <a href="/jeremiah/8-13.htm">Jeremiah 8:13</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-10.htm">Jeremiah 8:10</a>, sees himself compelled, for the restoration of equilibrium, to delete the middle part of <a href="/jeremiah/8-13.htm">Jeremiah 8:13</a> (from "no grapes" to "withered") as spurious; for which proceeding there is not the smallest reason, since this passage has neither the character of an explanatory gloss, nor is it a repetition from any place whatever, nor is it awanting in the lxx. Just as little ground is there to argue against the genuineness of the two passages from the variations found in them. Here in <a href="/jeremiah/8-10.htm">Jeremiah 8:10</a> we have &#1502;&#1511;&#1468;&#1496;&#1503;  &#1493;&#1506;&#1491;&#1470;&#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1493;&#1500; instead of the  &#1502;&#1511;&#1468;&#1496;&#1504;&#1468;&#1501;of <a href="/jeremiah/6-13.htm">Jeremiah 6:13</a>; but the suffix, which in the latter case pointed to the preceding "inhabitants of the land," was unnecessary here, where there is no such reference. In like manner, the forms &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1501; for &#1492;&#1499;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, and &#1506;&#1514; &#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1514;&#1501; for &#1506;&#1514;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1491;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, are but the more usual forms used by Jeremiah elsewhere. So the omission of the &#1488; in &#1497;&#1512;&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; for &#1497;&#1512;&#1508;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;, as coming either from the writer or the copyist, clearly does not make against the genuineness of the verses. And there is the less reason for making any difficulty about the passage, seeing that such repetitions are amongst the peculiarities of Jeremiah's style: cf. e.g., <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-31.htm">Jeremiah 7:31-33</a> with <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-5.htm">Jeremiah 19:5-7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-12.htm">Jeremiah 10:12-16</a> with <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-15.htm">Jeremiah 51:15-19</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-13.htm">Jeremiah 15:13-14</a>, with <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-3.htm">Jeremiah 17:3-4</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-14.htm">Jeremiah 16:14-15</a>, with <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-7.htm">Jeremiah 23:7-8</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5-6</a>, with <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-15.htm">Jeremiah 33:15-16</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-19.htm">Jeremiah 23:19-20</a>, with <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-23.htm">Jeremiah 30:23-24</a>, and other shorter repetitions. </body></html>
