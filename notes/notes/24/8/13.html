The people would not attend to reason; they would not act in the affairs of their souls with common prudence. Sin is backsliding; it is going back from the way that leads to life, to that which leads to destruction. 2. They would not attend to the warning of conscience. They did not take the first step towards repentance: true repentance begins in serious inquiry as to what we have done, from conviction that we have done amiss. 3. They would not attend to the ways of providence, nor understand the voice of God in them, ver. 7. They know not how to improve the seasons of grace, which God affords. Many boast of their religious knowledge, yet, unless taught by the Spirit of God, the instinct of brutes is a more sure guide than their supposed wisdom. 4. They would not attend to the written word. Many enjoy abundance of the means of grace, have Bibles and ministers, but they have them in vain. They will soon be ashamed of their devices. The pretenders to wisdom were the priests and the false prophets. They flattered people in sin, and so flattered them into destruction, silencing their fears and complaints with, All is well. Selfish teachers may promise peace when there is no peace; and thus men encourage each other in committing evil; but in the day of visitation they will have no refuge to flee unto.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Or, "I will gather and sweep them away, saith Jehovah: there are no grapes on the vine, and no figs on the fig-tree, and the leaf is dry: therefore will I appoint those that shall pass over them."

It is the actual condition of things which the prophet describes. Elsewhere Judah is compared to a vine with bad grapes (<a href="/jeremiah/2-21.htm">Jeremiah 2:21</a>); here the vine does not even pretend to bear fruit.

The construction, however, which this rendering implies is not perfectly natural, though supported by most of the ancient versions (except the Septuagint, which omits the words), and it is better to alter a single vowel-point, and render "And I will give them to those who shall pass over them." The phrase to pass away is constantly used of an invading host; e.g. <a href="/isaiah/8-7.htm">Isaiah 8:7</a>; <a href="/daniel/11-10.htm">Daniel 11:10, 40</a>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The People's Obstinacy in Wickedness, and the Dreadfulness of the Judgment. - Since the people cleaves stedfastly to its sin (<a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-4.htm">Jeremiah 8:4-13</a>), the Lord must punish sorely (<a href="/jeremiah/8-14.htm">Jeremiah 8:14</a> -23). - <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-4.htm">Jeremiah 8:4-13</a>. "And say to them, Thus hath the Lord said: Doth one fall, and not rise again? or doth one turn away, and not turn back again? <a href="/jeremiah/8-5.htm">Jeremiah 8:5</a>.

I listened and heard: they speak not aright; no one repenteth him of his wickedness, saying, What have I done? They all turn to their course again, like a horse rushing into the battle. <a href="/jeremiah/8-7.htm">Jeremiah 8:7</a>. Yea, the stork in the heaven knoweth her appointed times; and turtle-dove, and swallow, and crane, keep the time of their coming; but my people know not the judgment of Jahveh. <a href="/jeremiah/8-8.htm">Jeremiah 8:8</a>.

Therefore they shall fall amongst them that fall: in the time of their visitation they shall stumble, that Jahve said. <a href="/jeremiah/8-13.htm">Jeremiah 8:13</a>. Away, away will I sweep them, saith Jahveh: no grapes on the vine, and no figs on the fig-tree, and the leaf is withered; so I appoint unto them those that shall pass over them."<p>This strophe connects itself with what precedes. A judgment, dreadful as has been described in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-32.htm">Jeremiah 7:32-8:3</a>, will come on Judah, because the people cleaves stiffneckedly to its sins. The &#1493;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468; of <a href="/jeremiah/8-4.htm">Jeremiah 8:4</a> corresponds to that in <a href="/jeremiah/7-28.htm">Jeremiah 7:28</a>. The questioning clauses in <a href="/jeremiah/8-4.htm">Jeremiah 8:4</a> contain universal truths, which are applied to the people of Judah in <a href="/jeremiah/8-5.htm">Jeremiah 8:5</a>. The subjects to &#1497;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; and &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; are indefinite, hence singular and plural with like significance: cf. Gesen. 137, 3; Ew. 294, b. The verb &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;, turn oneself, turn about, is here used in a double sense: first, as turn away from one; and then turn towards him, return again. In the application in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-5.htm">Jeremiah 8:5</a>, the Pilel is used for to turn away from, and strengthened by: with perpetual turning away or backsliding. &#1504;&#1510;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514; is not partic. Niph. fem. from &#1504;&#1510;&#1495;, but an adjectival formation, continual, enduring, from &#1504;&#1510;&#1495;, continuance, durableness. "Jerusalem" belongs to "this people:" this people of Jerusalem; the loose grammatical connection by means of the stat. constr. not being maintained, if the first idea gives a sense intelligible by itself, so that the second noun may then be looked on rather in the light of an apposition conveying additional information; cf. Ew. 290, c. &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1502;&#1497;&#1514;, equivalent to &#1502;&#1512;&#1502;&#1492;, deceit against God. they refuse to return. Sense: they will not receive the truth, repent and return to God. The same idea is developed in <a href="/jeremiah/8-6.htm">Jeremiah 8:6</a>. The first person: I have listened and heard, Hitz. insists, refers to the prophet, "who is justified as to all he said in <a href="/jeremiah/8-5.htm">Jeremiah 8:5</a> by what he has seen." But we cannot account that even an "apt" view of the case, which makes the prophet cite his own observations to show that God had not spoken without cause. It is Jahveh that speaks in <a href="/jeremiah/8-5.htm">Jeremiah 8:5</a>; and seeing that <a href="/jeremiah/8-6.htm">Jeremiah 8:6</a> gives not the slightest hint of any change in the speaker, we are bound to take <a href="/jeremiah/8-6.htm">Jeremiah 8:6</a> also as spoken by God. Thus, to prove that they cleave unto deceit, Jahveh says that He has given heed to their deeds and habits, and heard how they speak the &#1500;&#1493;&#1488;&#1470;&#1499;&#1503;, the not right, i.e., lies and deceit. The next clause: not one repents him of his wickedness, corresponds to: they refuse to return; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/8-5.htm">Jeremiah 8:5</a> (&#1504;&#1495;&#1501; is partic.). Instead of this, the whole of it, i.e., all of them, turn again to their course. &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; with &#1489;, construed as in <a href="/hosea/12-7.htm">Hosea 12:7</a> : turn oneself to a thing, so as to enter into it. For &#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1510;&#1492;, the sig. course is certified to by <a href="/2_samuel/18-27.htm">2 Samuel 18:27</a>. The Chet. &#1502;&#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501; .tehC e is doubtless merely an error of transcription for &#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1510;&#1514;&#1501;, as is demanded by the Keri. Turn again into their course. The thought is: instead of considering, of becoming repentant, they continue their evil courses. This, too, is substantially what Hitz. gives. Ros., Graf, and others, again, take this in the sense of turning themselves away in their course; but it is not fair to deduce this sense for &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; without &#1502;&#1503; from <a href="/jeremiah/8-4.htm">Jeremiah 8:4</a>; nor is the addition of "from me" justifiable. Besides, this explanation does not suit the following comparison with the horse. It is against analogy to derive &#1502;&#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501; from &#1512;&#1510;&#1492; with the sig. desire, cupidity. Ew., following the Chald., adopts this sense both here and in <a href="/jeremiah/22-17.htm">Jeremiah 22:17</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-10.htm">Jeremiah 23:10</a>, though it is not called for in any of these passages, and is unsuitable in <a href="/jeremiah/22-17.htm">Jeremiah 22:17</a>. As a horse rusheth into the battle. &#1513;&#1473;&#1496;&#1507;, pour forth, overflow, hence rush on impetuously; by Jerome rightly translated, cum impetu vadens. Several commentators compare the Latin se effundere (Caes. Bell. Gall. v. 19) and effundi (Liv. xxviii. 7); but the cases are not quite in point, since in both the words are used of the cavalry, and not of the steed by itself. This simile makes way for more in <a href="/jeremiah/8-7.htm">Jeremiah 8:7</a>. Even the fowls under the heaven keep the time of their coming and departure, but Israel takes no concern for the judgment of its God; cf. <a href="/isaiah/1-3.htm">Isaiah 1:3</a>. &#1495;&#1505;&#1497;&#1491;&#1492;, (avis) pia, is the stork, not the heron; see on <a href="/leviticus/11-19.htm">Leviticus 11:19</a>. "In the heaven" refers to the flight of the stork. All the birds mentioned here are birds of passage. &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512; and &#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505; are turtle-dove and pigeon. For &#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505; the Masoretes read &#1505;&#1497;&#1505;, apparently to distinguish the word from that for horse; and so the oriental Codd. propose to read in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/38-14.htm">Isaiah 38:14</a>, although they wrote &#1506;&#1490;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; .&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505; is the crane (acc. to Saad. and Rashi), both here and in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/38-14.htm">Isaiah 38:14</a>, where Gesen., Knob., and others, mistaking the asyndeton, take it as an adjective in the sig. sighing.<p>(Note: Starting from this unproved interpretation of <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/38-14.htm">Isaiah 38:14</a>, and supporting their case from the lxx translation of the present passage, &#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;, Hitz. and Graf argue that &#1506;&#1490;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; is not the name of any particular bird, but only a qualifying word to &#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;, in order to distinguish the swallow from the horse, the sense more commonly attached to the same word. But that confused text of the lxx by no means justifies us in supposing that the &#1493; cop. was introduced subsequently into the Heb. text. It is possible that &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; is only a corrupt representation of &#1506;&#1490;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, and the &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; came into the lxx text in consequence of this corruption. but certainly the fact that the lxx, as also Aquil. and Symm., both here and in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/38-14.htm">Isaiah 38:14</a>, did not know what to make of the Hebrew word, and so transcribed it in Greek letters, leads us to conclude that these translators permitted themselves to be guided by <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/38.htm">Isaiah 38</a>, and omitted here also the copula, which was there omitted before &#1506;&#1490;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;.<p>&#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;  are the fixed times for the arrival and departure of the birds of passage. </body></html>
