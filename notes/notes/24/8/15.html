And when God appears against us, every thing that is against us appears formidable. As salvation only can be found in the Lord, so the present moment should be seized. Is there no medicine proper for a sick and dying kingdom? Is there no skilful, faithful hand to apply the medicine? Yes, God is able to help and to heal them. If sinners die of their wounds, their blood is upon their own heads. The blood of Christ is balm in Gilead, his Spirit is the Physician there, all-sufficient; so that the people may be healed, but will not.

When the great calamity comes on the sin-hardened people, they shall be confounded and overwhelmed in ruin (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/6-11.htm">Jeremiah 6:11</a>). They spurn at the word of Jahveh; whose wisdom then have they? None; for the word of the Lord alone is Israel's wisdom and understanding, <a href="/deuteronomy/4-6.htm">Deuteronomy 4:6</a>.<p>The threatening in <a href="/jeremiah/8-10.htm">Jeremiah 8:10</a> includes not only the wise ones, but the whole people. "Therefore" attaches to the central truth of <a href="/jeremiah/8-5.htm">Jeremiah 8:5</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-6.htm">Jeremiah 8:6</a>, which has been elucidated in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-7.htm">Jeremiah 8:7-9</a>. The first half of <a href="/jeremiah/8-10.htm">Jeremiah 8:10</a> corresponds, in shorter compass, to what has been said in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-12.htm">Jeremiah 6:12</a>, and is here continued in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-10.htm">Jeremiah 8:10-12</a> in the same words as in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-13.htm">Jeremiah 6:13-15</a>. &#1497;&#1493;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; are those who take possession, make themselves masters of a thing, as in <a href="/jeremiah/49-2.htm">Jeremiah 49:2</a> and <a href="/micah/1-15.htm">Micah 1:15</a>. This repetition of the three verses is not given in the lxx, and Hitz. therefore proposes to delete them as a supplementary interpolation, holding that they are not only superfluous, but that they interrupt the sense. For he thinks <a href="/jeremiah/8-13.htm">Jeremiah 8:13</a> connects remarkably well with <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-10.htm">Jeremiah 8:10</a>, but, taken out of its connection with what precedes as we have it, begins baldly enough. To this Graf has made fitting answer: This passage is in no respect more superfluous or awkward than <a href="/jeremiah/6-13.htm">Jeremiah 6:13</a>.; nor is the connection of <a href="/jeremiah/8-13.htm">Jeremiah 8:13</a> with <a href="/jeremiah/8-10.htm">Jeremiah 8:10</a> at all closer than with <a href="/jeremiah/8-12.htm">Jeremiah 8:12</a>. And Hitz., in order to defend the immediate connection between <a href="/jeremiah/8-13.htm">Jeremiah 8:13</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-10.htm">Jeremiah 8:10</a>, sees himself compelled, for the restoration of equilibrium, to delete the middle part of <a href="/jeremiah/8-13.htm">Jeremiah 8:13</a> (from "no grapes" to "withered") as spurious; for which proceeding there is not the smallest reason, since this passage has neither the character of an explanatory gloss, nor is it a repetition from any place whatever, nor is it awanting in the lxx. Just as little ground is there to argue against the genuineness of the two passages from the variations found in them. Here in <a href="/jeremiah/8-10.htm">Jeremiah 8:10</a> we have &#1502;&#1511;&#1468;&#1496;&#1503;  &#1493;&#1506;&#1491;&#1470;&#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1493;&#1500; instead of the  &#1502;&#1511;&#1468;&#1496;&#1504;&#1468;&#1501;of <a href="/jeremiah/6-13.htm">Jeremiah 6:13</a>; but the suffix, which in the latter case pointed to the preceding "inhabitants of the land," was unnecessary here, where there is no such reference. In like manner, the forms &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1501; for &#1492;&#1499;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, and &#1506;&#1514; &#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1514;&#1501; for &#1506;&#1514;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1491;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, are but the more usual forms used by Jeremiah elsewhere. So the omission of the &#1488; in &#1497;&#1512;&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; for &#1497;&#1512;&#1508;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;, as coming either from the writer or the copyist, clearly does not make against the genuineness of the verses. And there is the less reason for making any difficulty about the passage, seeing that such repetitions are amongst the peculiarities of Jeremiah's style: cf. e.g., <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-31.htm">Jeremiah 7:31-33</a> with <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-5.htm">Jeremiah 19:5-7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-12.htm">Jeremiah 10:12-16</a> with <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-15.htm">Jeremiah 51:15-19</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-13.htm">Jeremiah 15:13-14</a>, with <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-3.htm">Jeremiah 17:3-4</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-14.htm">Jeremiah 16:14-15</a>, with <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-7.htm">Jeremiah 23:7-8</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5-6</a>, with <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-15.htm">Jeremiah 33:15-16</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-19.htm">Jeremiah 23:19-20</a>, with <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-23.htm">Jeremiah 30:23-24</a>, and other shorter repetitions. </body></html>
