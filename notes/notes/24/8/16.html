Accordingly, Grotius observes, after Jerome, that Nebuchadnezzar, having subdued Phenicia, passed through the tribe of Dan in his way to Judea. When the enemy therefore was advanced so near, it was time for the people of Judah to take the alarm, and to provide for their own safety. <span class="ital">The whole land trembled at the neighing of his strong ones </span>— The word <span class="greekheb">אביריו</span>, here rendered <span class="ital">strong ones, </span>signifies <span class="ital">horses </span>in several places, and is so rendered here by Dr. Waterland, (see <a href="/judges/5-22.htm" title="Then were the horse hoofs broken by the means of the prancings, the prancings of their mighty ones.">Jdg 5:22</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/47-3.htm" title="At the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong horses, at the rushing of his chariots, and at the rumbling of his wheels, the fathers shall not look back to their children for feebleness of hands;">Jeremiah 47:3</a>,) and is so understood by the LXX. By the whole land <span class="ital">trembling </span>is meant the inhabitants being terrified at the vast number of horses that were in the Chaldean army, the neighing of which they heard; which struck them with great dread, as they had few or no horses in Judea to oppose to them. <span class="ital">For they have devoured the land, and all that is in it </span>— All the fruits, and all the forage, they have devoured or taken away. It is to be observed, that the prophet speaks of it as already done, because it was so represented to him in his vision. <span class="ital">The city, and those that dwell therein </span>— Both town and country are laid waste before them, and not only the wealth, but the inhabitants of both are taken or destroyed. Jerusalem is here chiefly meant by <span class="ital">the city, </span>for, though the taking of other cities was attended with a slaughter of the inhabitants, the sacking of Jerusalem was the greatest of all their calamities, as being the metropolis, and the richest and most populous of all their cities.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:14-22 At length they begin to see the hand of God lifted up.

Is there no medicine proper for a sick and dying kingdom? Is there no skilful, faithful hand to apply the medicine? Yes, God is able to help and to heal them. If sinners die of their wounds, their blood is upon their own heads. The blood of Christ is balm in Gilead, his Spirit is the Physician there, all-sufficient; so that the people may be healed, but will not.

"Therefore" attaches to the central truth of <a href="/jeremiah/8-5.htm">Jeremiah 8:5</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-6.htm">Jeremiah 8:6</a>, which has been elucidated in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-7.htm">Jeremiah 8:7-9</a>. The first half of <a href="/jeremiah/8-10.htm">Jeremiah 8:10</a> corresponds, in shorter compass, to what has been said in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-12.htm">Jeremiah 6:12</a>, and is here continued in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-10.htm">Jeremiah 8:10-12</a> in the same words as in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-13.htm">Jeremiah 6:13-15</a>. &#1497;&#1493;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; are those who take possession, make themselves masters of a thing, as in <a href="/jeremiah/49-2.htm">Jeremiah 49:2</a> and <a href="/micah/1-15.htm">Micah 1:15</a>. This repetition of the three verses is not given in the lxx, and Hitz. therefore proposes to delete them as a supplementary interpolation, holding that they are not only superfluous, but that they interrupt the sense. For he thinks <a href="/jeremiah/8-13.htm">Jeremiah 8:13</a> connects remarkably well with <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-10.htm">Jeremiah 8:10</a>, but, taken out of its connection with what precedes as we have it, begins baldly enough. To this Graf has made fitting answer: This passage is in no respect more superfluous or awkward than <a href="/jeremiah/6-13.htm">Jeremiah 6:13</a>.; nor is the connection of <a href="/jeremiah/8-13.htm">Jeremiah 8:13</a> with <a href="/jeremiah/8-10.htm">Jeremiah 8:10</a> at all closer than with <a href="/jeremiah/8-12.htm">Jeremiah 8:12</a>. And Hitz., in order to defend the immediate connection between <a href="/jeremiah/8-13.htm">Jeremiah 8:13</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-10.htm">Jeremiah 8:10</a>, sees himself compelled, for the restoration of equilibrium, to delete the middle part of <a href="/jeremiah/8-13.htm">Jeremiah 8:13</a> (from "no grapes" to "withered") as spurious; for which proceeding there is not the smallest reason, since this passage has neither the character of an explanatory gloss, nor is it a repetition from any place whatever, nor is it awanting in the lxx. Just as little ground is there to argue against the genuineness of the two passages from the variations found in them. Here in <a href="/jeremiah/8-10.htm">Jeremiah 8:10</a> we have &#1502;&#1511;&#1468;&#1496;&#1503;  &#1493;&#1506;&#1491;&#1470;&#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1493;&#1500; instead of the  &#1502;&#1511;&#1468;&#1496;&#1504;&#1468;&#1501;of <a href="/jeremiah/6-13.htm">Jeremiah 6:13</a>; but the suffix, which in the latter case pointed to the preceding "inhabitants of the land," was unnecessary here, where there is no such reference. In like manner, the forms &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1501; for &#1492;&#1499;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, and &#1506;&#1514; &#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1514;&#1501; for &#1506;&#1514;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1491;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, are but the more usual forms used by Jeremiah elsewhere. So the omission of the &#1488; in &#1497;&#1512;&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; for &#1497;&#1512;&#1508;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;, as coming either from the writer or the copyist, clearly does not make against the genuineness of the verses. And there is the less reason for making any difficulty about the passage, seeing that such repetitions are amongst the peculiarities of Jeremiah's style: cf. e.g., <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-31.htm">Jeremiah 7:31-33</a> with <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-5.htm">Jeremiah 19:5-7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-12.htm">Jeremiah 10:12-16</a> with <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-15.htm">Jeremiah 51:15-19</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-13.htm">Jeremiah 15:13-14</a>, with <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-3.htm">Jeremiah 17:3-4</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-14.htm">Jeremiah 16:14-15</a>, with <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-7.htm">Jeremiah 23:7-8</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5-6</a>, with <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-15.htm">Jeremiah 33:15-16</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-19.htm">Jeremiah 23:19-20</a>, with <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-23.htm">Jeremiah 30:23-24</a>, and other shorter repetitions. </body></html>
