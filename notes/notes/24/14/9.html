But it was rather the cry of their trouble, and of their sin, than of their prayer. Let us be thankful for the mercy of water, that we may not be taught to value it by feeling the want of it. See what dependence husbandmen have upon the Divine providence. They cannot plough nor sow in hope, unless God water their furrows. The case even of the wild beasts was very pitiable. The people are not forward to pray, but the prophet prays for them. Sin is humbly confessed. Our sins not only accuse us, but answer against us. Our best pleas in prayer are those fetched from the glory of God's own name. We should dread God's departure, more than the removal of our creature-comforts. He has given Israel his word to hope in. It becomes us in prayer to show ourselves more concerned for God's glory than for our own comfort. And if we now return to the Lord, he will save us to the glory of his grace.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Astonied - The word may possibly mean "one who is taken by surprise and loses his presence of mind." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. astonied&#8212;like a "mighty man," at other times able to help (Isa 59:1), but now stunned by a sudden calamity so as to disappoint the hopes drawn from him.<p>art in the midst of us&#8212;(Ex 29:45, 46; Le 26:11, 12).<p>called by thy name&#8212;(Da 9:18, 19) as Thine own peculiar people (De 9:29).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Astonied; </span> the Hebrew word here used being found in no place of holy writ but this, hath given interpreters a liberty to translate it variously, <span class="ital">sleepy, weak, astonished, frighted</span>, like a man in such disorder, through some great passions, that he is able to do nothing. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">As a mighty man that cannot save; </span> like a man who in his own nature is strong and mighty enough, but through sickness or passion is so weakened, that he cannot put forth any strength for the succour and relief of his friends. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Yet</span> (saith the prophet) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">thou art in the midst of us; </span> that is, we have thy temple, to which thou hast promised thy special presence; or rather it is to be understood of the whole land, according to what God had declared, <span class="bld"><a href="/numbers/5-3.htm" title="Both male and female shall you put out, without the camp shall you put them; that they defile not their camps, in the middle whereof I dwell.">Numbers 5:3</a> 35:34</span>, Defile not the land which ye shall inhabit, wherein I dwell: for I the Lord dwell among the children of Israel. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">We are called by thy name; </span> that is, we are called the Lord’s people, and that not only by others, amongst whom we have that repute, but by thyself.

This description gives a touching picture of the distress into which the land and its inhabitants have fallen for lack of rain. Judah is the kingdom or the country with its inhabitants; the gates as used poetically for the cities with the citizens. Not mankind only, but the land itself mourns and pines away, with all the creatures that live on it; cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-4.htm">Jeremiah 14:4</a>, where the ground is said to be dismayed along with the tillers of it. The gates of the cities are mentioned as being the places where the citizens congregate. &#1488;&#1502;&#1500;&#1500;, fade away, pine, is strengthened by: are black, i.e., mourn, down to the earth; pregnant for: set themselves mourning on the ground. As frequently, Jerusalem is mentioned alongside of Judah as being its capital. Their cry of anguish rises up to heaven. This universal mourning is specialized from <a href="/jeremiah/14-3.htm">Jeremiah 14:3</a> on. Their nobles, i.e., the distinguished men of Judah and Jerusalem, send their mean ones, i.e., their retainers or servants and maids, for water to the wells (&#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501;, pits, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/3-16.htm">2 Kings 3:16</a>, here cisterns). The Chet. &#1510;&#1506;&#1493;&#1512;, here and in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-4.htm">Jeremiah 48:4</a>, is an unusual form for &#1510;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512;, Keri. Finding no water, they return, their vessels empty, i.e., with empty pitchers, ashamed of their disappointed hope. &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468; is strengthened by the synonym &#1492;&#1499;&#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;. Covering the head is a token of deep grief turned inwards upon itself; cf. <a href="/2_samuel/15-30.htm">2 Samuel 15:30</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/19-5.htm">2 Samuel 19:5</a>. &#1492;&#1488;&#1491;&#1502;&#1492; is the ground generally. &#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; is a relative clause: quae consternata est. "Because no rain," etc., literally as in <a href="/1_kings/17-7.htm">1 Kings 17:7</a>. - Even the beasts droop and perish. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; is intensive: yea, even. The hind brings forth and forsakes, sc. the new-born offspring, because for want of grass she cannot sustain herself and her young. &#1506;&#1494;&#1493;&#1489;, infin. abs. set with emphasis for the temp. fin., as <a href="/genesis/41-43.htm">Genesis 41:43</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/8-11.htm">Exodus 8:11</a>, and often; cf. Gesen. 131, 4, a, Ew. 351, c. The hind was regarded by the ancients as tenderly caring for her young, cf. Boch. Hieroz. i. lib. 3, c. 17 (ii. p. 254, ed. Ros.) The wild asses upon the bleak mountain-tops, where these animals choose to dwell, gasp for air, because, by reason of the dreadful drought, it is not possible to get a breath of air even on the hills. Like the &#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, jackals, cf. <a href="/jeremiah/9-10.htm">Jeremiah 9:10</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-22.htm">Jeremiah 10:22</a>, etc. Vulg. has dracones, with the Aram. versions; and Hitz. and Graf are of opinion that the mention of jackals is not here in point, and that, since &#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; does not mean dracones, the word stands here, as in <a href="/exodus/29-3.htm">Exodus 29:3</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/32-2.htm">Exodus 32:2</a>, for &#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503;, the monster inhabiting the water, a crocodile or some kind of whale that stretches its head out of the water to draw breath with gaping jaws. On this Ng. has well remarked: he cannot see why the gaping, panting jaws of the jackal should not serve as a figure in such a case as the present. Their eyes fail away - from exhaustion due to want of wear. &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1489;, bushes and under-shrubs, as distinguished from &#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;, green grass. </body></html>
