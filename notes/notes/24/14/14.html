They had forsaken his service, therefore he would punish them according to their sins. He forbade Jeremiah to plead for them. The false prophets were the most criminal. The Lord pronounces condemnation on them; but as the people loved to have it so, they were not to escape judgments. False teachers encourage men to expect peace and salvation, without repentance, faith, conversion, and holiness of life. But those who believe a lie must not plead if for an excuse.

The things were certainly false in themselves, being contrary to God’s revelation; but setting that aside, for them to pretend God had revealed that to them which he had not revealed was a formed lie. God denieth that he ever commanded them to speak any such things, or sent them upon any such errands; they prophesied what came in their own foolish heads, and the deceits of their own hearts. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/14.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then said the Lord unto me,....

"If our iniquities testify against us, O Jahveh, deal Thou for Thy name's sake, for many are our backslidings; against Thee have we sinned. <a href="/jeremiah/14-8.htm">Jeremiah 14:8</a>. Thou hope of Israel, his Saviour in time of need, why wilt Thou be as a stranger in the land, like a wayfarer that hath put up to tarry for a night? <a href="/jeremiah/14-9.htm">Jeremiah 14:9</a>. Why wilt Thou be as a man astonied, as a mighty man that cannot help, and yet Thou art in the midst of us, Jahveh, and Thy name is named upon us - O leave us not!"<p>The prophet utters this prayer in the name of his people (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/14-11.htm">Jeremiah 14:11</a>). It begins with confession of sore transgression. Thus the chastisement which has befallen them they have deserved as a just punishment; but the Lord is besought to help for His name's sake, i.e., not: "for the sake of Thy honour, with which it is not consistent that contempt of Thy will should go unpunished" (Hitz.). This interpretation suits neither the idea of the name of God nor the context. The name of God is the manifestation of God's being. From Moses' time on, God, as Jahveh, has revealed Himself as the Redeemer and Saviour of the children of Israel, whom He had adopted to be His people, and as God, who is merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and of great goodness and faithfulness (<a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6</a>). As such He is besought to reveal Himself now that they confess their backsliding and sin, and seek His grace. Not for the sake of His honour in the eyes of the world, lest the heathen believe He has no power to help, as Graf holds, for all reference to the heathen nations is foreign to this connection; but He is entreated to help, not to belie the hope of His people, because Israel sets its hope in Him as Saviour in time of need (<a href="/jeremiah/14-9.htm">Jeremiah 14:9</a>). If by withholding rain He makes His land and people to pine, then He does not reveal Himself as the lord and owner of Judah, not as the God that dwells amidst His people; but He seems a stranger passing through the land, who sets up His tent there only to spend the night, who "feels no share in the weal and woe of the dwellers therein" (Hitz.). This is the meaning of the question in <a href="/jeremiah/14-8.htm">Jeremiah 14:8</a>. The ancient expositors take &#1504;&#1496;&#1492; elliptically, as in <a href="/genesis/12-8.htm">Genesis 12:8</a> : that stretches out His tent to pass the night. Hitz., again, objects that the wayfarer does not drag a tent about with him, and, like Ew., takes this verb in the sense of swerve from the direct route, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-19.htm">2 Samuel 2:19</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-21.htm">2 Samuel 2:21</a>, etc. But the reason alleged is not tenable; since travellers did often carry their tents with them, and &#1504;&#1496;&#1492;, to turn oneself, is not used absolutely in the sig. to turn aside from the way, without the qualification: to the right or to the left. &#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; is in use for to turn aside to tarry, to turn in, <a href="/jeremiah/15-5.htm">Jeremiah 15:5</a>. We therefore abide by the old interpretation, since "swerve from the way" has here no suitable meaning. </body></html>
