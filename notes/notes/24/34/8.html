The law of Moses did not allow in the case of a free-born Hebrew more than a temporary bondage of seven years (<a href="/exodus/21-2.htm" title="If you buy an Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing.">Exodus 21:2</a>; <a href="/context/deuteronomy/15-12.htm" title="And if your brother, an Hebrew man, or an Hebrew woman, be sold to you, and serve you six years; then in the seventh year you shall let him go free from you.">Deuteronomy 15:12-18</a>), extended (but under the form of serfage rather than slavery) in the later regulations of <a href="/context/leviticus/25-39.htm" title="And if your brother that dwells by you be waxen poor, and be sold to you; you shall not compel him to serve as a bondservant:">Leviticus 25:39-40</a> to the time that might intervene between the date of purchase and the commencement of the next year of jubilee. In <a href="/2_kings/4-1.htm" title="Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets to Elisha, saying, Your servant my husband is dead; and you know that your servant did fear the LORD: and the creditor is come to take to him my two sons to be slaves.">2Kings 4:1</a> we have an instance of the working of the law, as bringing even the sons of a prophet into this modified slavery. Only if the man preferred his state as a slave to the risks of freedom could his master retain him after the appointed limit (<a href="/context/exodus/21-5.htm" title="And if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free:">Exodus 21:5-6</a>). The law had apparently fallen into disuse, and the nobles of Judah, like those of Athens before Solon, and Rome before the institution of the Tribunate, had used the law of debt to bring a large number of their fellow citizens into slavery, just as their successors did after the return from Babylon (<a href="/nehemiah/5-5.htm" title="Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brothers, our children as their children: and, see, we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and some of our daughters are brought to bondage already: neither is it in our power to redeem them; for other men have our lands and vineyards.">Nehemiah 5:5</a>). Under the pressure of the danger from the Chaldæan invasion, and that he might have the ready service of freemen instead of the forced work of slaves, perhaps also in consequence of the revival of the law, that followed on its discovery, probably in the form of the Book of Deuteronomy, in the days of Josiah (<a href="/2_kings/22-8.htm" title="And Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD. And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan, and he read it.">2Kings 22:8</a>), Zedekiah had been led to promise freedom to all the slave population of this class that were within the walls of Jerusalem, either as a celebration of a Sabbatic year, or jubilee, or, irrespective of any such observance, as a reparation for past neglect. The step was probably not without its influence in giving fresh energy to the defenders of the city. The Chaldæans, threatened by the approach of an Egyptian army (<a href="/jeremiah/37-5.htm" title="Then Pharaoh's army was come forth out of Egypt: and when the Chaldeans that besieged Jerusalem heard tidings of them, they departed from Jerusalem.">Jeremiah 37:5</a>), raised the siege (<a href="/jeremiah/34-21.htm" title="And Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes will I give into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life, and into the hand of the king of Babylon's army, which are gone up from you.">Jeremiah 34:21</a>). When the danger was past, however, the princes who had agreed to the emancipation returned to their old policy of oppression (<a href="/jeremiah/34-11.htm" title="But afterward they turned, and caused the servants and the handmaids, whom they had let go free, to return, and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids.">Jeremiah 34:11</a>), and those who had been liberated were brought under a bondage all the more bitter for the temporary taste of freedom. Against this perfidious tyranny the prophet, stirred by “the word of the Lord,” bears his protests. His sympathies, like those of true prophets at all times, were with the poor and the oppressed. The phrase “proclaim liberty” was closely connected with the year of jubilee, as in <a href="/leviticus/25-10.htm" title="And you shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout all the land to all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubilee to you; and you shall return every man to his possession, and you shall return every man to his family.">Leviticus 25:10</a>, <a href="/isaiah/61-1.htm" title="The Spirit of the Lord GOD is on me; because the LORD has anointed me to preach good tidings to the meek; he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound;">Isaiah 61:1</a>.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/34.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>34:8-22 A Jew should not be held in servitude above seven years. This law they and their fathers had broken. And when there was some hope that the siege was raised, they forced the servants they had released into their services again. Those who think to cheat God by dissembled repentance and partial reformation, put the greatest cheat upon their own souls. This shows that liberty to sin, is really only liberty to have the sorest judgments. It is just with God to disappoint expectations of mercy, when we disappoint the expectations of duty. And when reformation springs only from terror, it is seldom lasting. Solemn vows thus entered into, profane the ordinances of God; and the most forward to bind themselves by appeals to God, are commonly most ready to break them. Let us look to our hearts, that our repentance may be real, and take care that the law of God regulates our conduct.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/34.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>It is usual with commentators to say that, the laws dealing with the emancipation of the Hebrew slaves, as also that of the land resting during the sabbatical year, were not observed. The narrative teaches us the exact contrary. The manumission of the slaves on the present occasion was the spontaneous act of Zedekiah and the people. They knew of the law, and acknowledged its obligation. The observance of it was, no doubt, lax: the majority let their own selfish interests prevail; but the minority made might give way to right, and Zedekiah supported their efforts though only in a weak way.<p>Early in January, in the ninth year of Zedekiah, the Chaldaean army approached Jerusalem. The people made a covenant with the king, who appears as the abettor of the measure, to let their slaves go free. Possibly patriotism had its share in this: and as Jerusalem was strongly fortified, all classes possibly hoped that if the slaves were manumitted, they too would labor with a more hearty good-will in resisting the enemy. In the summer of the same year the Egyptians advanced to the rescue, and Nebuchadnezzar withdrew to meet their attack. The Jews with a strange levity, which sets them before us in a most despicable light, at once forced the manumitted slaves back into bondage. With noble indignation Jeremiah rebukes them for their treachery, assures them that the Chaldaean army will return, and warns them of the certainty of the punishment which they so richly merited.<p><a href="/jeremiah/34-8.htm">Jeremiah 34:8</a><p>As the Chaldaean army swept over the country the wealthier classes would all flee to Jerusalem, taking with them their households. And as the Mosaic Law was probably more carefully kept there than in the country, the presence in these families of slaves who had grown grey in service may have given offence to the stricter classes at the capital.<p>To proclaim liberty unto them - The words are those of the proclamation of the year of jubile to the people, whereupon it became their duty to set their slaves free.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/34.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8.

Here begins a new prophecy, which was delivered some time after the former; that was given out while the king of Babylon was besieging Jerusalem; this after he had quitted the siege for a while, and was gone to meet the king of Egypt, who was coming to the relief of the city, as appears from <a href="/jeremiah/34-21.htm">Jeremiah 34:21</a>; though the Jews (k) say this was delivered in the seventh year of Zedekiah, in the first month, and tenth day of the month; at the same time that the elders of Israel came to Ezekiel, to inquire of the Lord by him, <a href="/ezekiel/20-1.htm">Ezekiel 20:1</a>; which was two years before the king of Babylon came against Jerusalem; but this seems not likely. It is said to be <p>after that the King Zedekiah made a covenant with all the people that were at Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty unto them; not unto the people, or to themselves, the king and the people; unless the sense is, that the king and the people entered into an agreement among themselves to make proclamation, that liberty would be granted by them to their servants; for the liberty proclaimed was to the servants, and not to them. This seems to confirm it, that it was while the city was besieged that this covenant was made; since it was made only with the people at Jerusalem, which were pent up in it; for otherwise it would in all probability have been made with all the people of the land; and seems to have been done with this view, to obtain this favour of the Lord, that they might gain their freedom from the enemy, and come not under the yoke and into the servitude of the king of Babylon: and very probable it is that they did not do this of their own accord, but were exhorted to it by Jeremiah; who perhaps, among other sins, had reproved them for the breach of the law respecting the liberty of servants. <p>(k) Seder Olam Rabba, c. 26. p. 74. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/34.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><i>This is</i> the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, after king Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people who <i>were</i> at Jerusalem, <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> to proclaim liberty to them;</span><p>(d) When the enemy was at hand and they saw themselves in danger, they would seem holy, and so began some kind of reformation: but soon after they uttered their hypocrisy.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/34.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">8</span>. <span class="ital">had made a covenant</span>] According to <a href="/exodus/21-2.htm" title="If you buy an Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing.">Exodus 21:2</a> [E] a Hebrew male slave was to be set free after six years’ service, and by <a href="/deuteronomy/15-12.htm" title="And if your brother, an Hebrew man, or an Hebrew woman, be sold to you, and serve you six years; then in the seventh year you shall let him go free from you.">Deuteronomy 15:12</a> this was extended to female slaves. The conscience-quickening power of impending danger, in meeting which the slaves, if enfranchised, would be more ready to co-operate with their former masters, seems to have induced Zedekiah, naturally too weak-minded a man to have displayed much vigour in urging any such conduct upon his subjects, to make the agreement with them here spoken of. This view of the motive is to be preferred to Du.’s theory that the slaves were turned out of the city during the siege because of the burden of feeding persons whose normal occupation of tillage, etc. was necessarily in abeyance. The narrative on the contrary implies that the action was to the slaves’ advantage (see <span class="ital"><a href="/jeremiah/34-16.htm" title="But you turned and polluted my name, and caused every man his servant, and every man his handmaid, whom he had set at liberty at their pleasure, to return, and brought them into subjection, to be to you for servants and for handmaids.">Jeremiah 34:16</a></span>), and that it was from motives of selfishness that the edict, though sanctioned by the solemnity of an oath, was cancelled on the temporary withdrawal of the besiegers to meet the approaching army of Pharaoh (<span class="ital"><a href="/jeremiah/34-21.htm" title="And Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes will I give into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life, and into the hand of the king of Babylon's army, which are gone up from you.">Jeremiah 34:21</a></span>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">to proclaim liberty unto them</span>] The same phrase is used of the proclamation made in the year of jubilee (<a href="/leviticus/25-10.htm" title="And you shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout all the land to all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubilee to you; and you shall return every man to his possession, and you shall return every man to his family.">Leviticus 25:10</a>). “Unto them,” if it be not an insertion, refers to the slaves.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>8–22.

And thou shalt not escape from his hand, but shalt certainly be seized and delivered into his hand; and thine eyes shall see the eyes of the king of Babylon, and his mouth shall speak with thy mouth, and thou shalt go to Babylon. <a href="/jeremiah/34-4.htm">Jeremiah 34:4</a>.

In peace shalt thou die; and as with the burnings of thy fathers, the former kings who were before thee, so shall they make a burning for thee, and they shall wail for thee, [crying,] 'Alas, lord!' for I have spoken the word, saith Jahveh. - On <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-2.htm">Jeremiah 34:2</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-3.htm">Jeremiah 34:3</a>, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-3.htm">Jeremiah 32:3-5</a>. "But hear," <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-4.htm">Jeremiah 34:4</a>, introduces an exception to what has been said before; but the meaning of <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-4.htm">Jeremiah 34:4</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/34-5.htm">Jeremiah 34:5</a> is disputed. They are usually understood in this say: Zedekiah shall be carried into exile to Babylon, but shall not be killed with the sword, or executed, but shall die a peaceful death, and be buried with royal honours. But C. B. Michaelis, Venema, Hitzig, and Graf take the words as an exception that will occur, should Zedekiah follow the advice given him to deliver himself up to the king of Babylon, instead of continuing the struggle. Then what is denounced in <a href="/jeremiah/34-3.htm">Jeremiah 34:3</a> will not happen; Zedekiah shall not be carried away to Babylon, but shall die as king in Jerusalem. This view rests on the hypothesis that the divine message has for its object to induce the king to submit and give up himself (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/38-17.htm">Jeremiah 38:17</a>.). But this supposition has no foundation; and what must be inserted, as the condition laid before Zedekiah, "if thou dost willingly submit to the king of Babylon," is quite arbitrary, and incompatible with the spirit of the word, "But hear the word of Jahveh," for in this case <a href="/jeremiah/34-4.htm">Jeremiah 34:4</a> at least would require to run, "Obey the word of Jahveh" (&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1489;&#1512; ), as <a href="/jeremiah/38-20.htm">Jeremiah 38:20</a>. To take the words &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; &#1491;&#1489;&#1512;in the sense, "Give ear to the word, obey the word of Jahveh," is not merely inadmissible grammatically, but also against the context; for the word of Jahveh which Zedekiah is to hear, gives no directions as to how he is to act, but is simply an intimation as to what the end of his life shall be: to change or avert this does not stand in his power, so that we cannot here think of obedience or disobedience. The message in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-4.htm">Jeremiah 34:4</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/34-5.htm">Jeremiah 34:5</a> states more in detail what that was which lay before Zedekiah: he shall fall into the hands of the king of Babylon, be carried into exile in Babylon, yet shall not die a violent death through the sword, but die peacefully, and be buried with honour - not, like Jehoiakim, fall in battle, and be left unmourned and unburied (<a href="/jeremiah/22-18.htm">Jeremiah 22:18</a>.). This intimation accords with the notices given elsewhere as to the end of Zedekiah (<a href="/jeremiah/32-5.htm">Jeremiah 32:5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-5.htm">Jeremiah 39:5-7</a>). Although Zedekiah died a prisoner in Babylon (<a href="/jeremiah/52-11.htm">Jeremiah 52:11</a>), yet his imprisonment would not necessarily be an obstacle in the way of an honourable burial after the fashion of his fathers. When Jehoiachin, after an imprisonment of thirty-seven years, was raised again to royal honours, then also might there be accorded not merely a tolerably comfortable imprisonment to Zedekiah himself, but to the Jews also, at his death, the permission to bury their king according to their national custom. Nor is anything to be found elsewhere contrary to this view of the words. The supposition that Zedekiah caused the prophet to be imprisoned on account of this message to him, which Ngelsbach has laboured hard to reconcile with the common acceptation of the passage, is wholly devoid of foundation in fact, and does not suit the time into which this message falls; for Jeremiah was not imprisoned till after the time when the Chaldeans were obliged for a season to raise the siege, on the approach of the Egyptians, and that, too, not at the command of the king, but by the watchman at the gate, on pretence that he was a deserter. "Thou shalt die in peace," in contrast with "thou shalt die by the sword," marks a peaceful death on a bed of sickness in contrast with execution, but not (what Graf introduces into the words) in addition, his being deposited in the sepulchre of his fathers. "With the burnings of thy fathers," etc., is to be understood, according to <a href="/2_chronicles/16-14.htm">2 Chronicles 16:14</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-19.htm">2 Chronicles 21:19</a>, of the burning of aromatic spices in honour of the dead; for the burning of corpses was not customary among the Hebrews: see on <a href="/2_chronicles/16-14.htm">2 Chronicles 16:14</a>.
