This law they and their fathers had broken. And when there was some hope that the siege was raised, they forced the servants they had released into their services again. Those who think to cheat God by dissembled repentance and partial reformation, put the greatest cheat upon their own souls. This shows that liberty to sin, is really only liberty to have the sorest judgments. It is just with God to disappoint expectations of mercy, when we disappoint the expectations of duty. And when reformation springs only from terror, it is seldom lasting. Solemn vows thus entered into, profane the ordinances of God; and the most forward to bind themselves by appeals to God, are commonly most ready to break them. Let us look to our hearts, that our repentance may be real, and take care that the law of God regulates our conduct.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/34.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The words ... - The Jews spoke of "cutting" a covenant, because the contracting parties cut a calf in twain and passed between the pieces.

Of these he spareth none, but threatens both the king, and nobles, and great courtiers, as well as the people, that he would give them into the hand of their enemies that thirsted after their blood; they should be slain, and their dead bodies should not be buried. Herein the righteousness of God appeared, by doing to them as they desired (by passing betwixt the calf) that God would do in case they did not keep to the promise they had made, and called God to witness, and challenging him to destroy them if they did not fulfil what they covenanted for. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/34.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>I will even give them into the hand of their enemies,....

In order to place the transgression in its proper light, He mentions, first of all, that, when He led Israel out of Egypt, He concluded with them a covenant to the effect that every one of them should set free his Hebrew servant at the end of seven years; He also mentions that their fathers had transgressed this covenant (<a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-13.htm">Jeremiah 34:13</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/34-14.htm">Jeremiah 34:14</a>). The designation of Egypt as a house of bondmen, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/13-3.htm">Exodus 13:3</a>, <a href="/exodus/13-14.htm">Exodus 13:14</a>; <a href="/exodus/20-2.htm">Exodus 20:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-12.htm">Deuteronomy 6:12</a>, etc., possesses a special emphasis, and points to what is mentioned in <a href="/deuteronomy/15-15.htm">Deuteronomy 15:15</a> as the motive for obeying the law referred to in the address. Because Israel was a servant in Egypt, and the Lord has redeemed him out of this house of bondmen, therefore must they not treat as slaves their brethren who had fallen into poverty, but set them free after six years of service. The expression "at the end (after the lapse) of seven years" is to be understood in the same way as the expression "after eight days." As this just means "when seven days are completed," so also, according to the law, <a href="/exodus/21-2.htm">Exodus 21:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-12.htm">Deuteronomy 15:12</a>, the emancipation was to follow in the seventh year, after six full years of service. "Who sold himself to thee" is an expression copied from <a href="/deuteronomy/15-12.htm">Deuteronomy 15:12</a>. - From this sin of their fathers they had now for a little turned away, and, in a solemn covenant, resolved to free the bondmen, as the law decreed (<a href="/jeremiah/34-15.htm">Jeremiah 34:15</a>); but they have immediately profaned the name of the Lord again by revoking this decree, viz., by breaking the covenant made before God. &#1500;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501;, "according to their pleasure," like e&#1500;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;&#1468;, <a href="/deuteronomy/21-14.htm">Deuteronomy 21:14</a>.</body></html>
