This law they and their fathers had broken. And when there was some hope that the siege was raised, they forced the servants they had released into their services again. Those who think to cheat God by dissembled repentance and partial reformation, put the greatest cheat upon their own souls. This shows that liberty to sin, is really only liberty to have the sorest judgments. It is just with God to disappoint expectations of mercy, when we disappoint the expectations of duty. And when reformation springs only from terror, it is seldom lasting. Solemn vows thus entered into, profane the ordinances of God; and the most forward to bind themselves by appeals to God, are commonly most ready to break them. Let us look to our hearts, that our repentance may be real, and take care that the law of God regulates our conduct.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/34.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The house of bondmen - The miserable prison in which, after being worked in the fields all day in gangs, the slaves were shut up at night.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/34.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14.

God would not have his people take advantage of the sudden and rash acts of their brethren, which were the effects of passion. Notwithstanding this law the Jews, who were always a very covetous, griping people, did otherwise. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/34.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>At the end of seven years,.... Not when seven years were elapsed and fully completed; but within the compass of seven years, or as soon as the seventh year was began; for this term of seven years is the term of the seventh year coming in, and not going out, as appears from the law itself, <a href="/exodus/21-9.htm">Exodus 21:9</a>; and from an after clause in this verse, "when he hath served thee six years"; at the end of which, and the beginning of the seventh: and so Maimonides (m) interprets this law, <p>"he whom the sanhedrim sold served six years from the day of his sale, and at the beginning of the seventh year he was free:'' <p>though the Vulgate Latin version very wrongly renders it, "when seven years are completed"; which version Sanctius takes a good deal of pains to reconcile to the original law. A Hebrew might sell himself for more years than six; he might sell himself for ten or twelve, as the above Jewish writer says, and nothing could release him but the year of jubilee; and that would do it, if he had served but one year (n); <p>let ye go every man his brother, an Hebrew, which hath been sold unto thee; or, "hath sold himself unto thee" (o); to be a servant; for money was not given with apprentices to their masters, as is usual with us; but masters gave money for their servants, and bought them either of themselves, or of the magistrates; hence it is said, "if thou buy an Hebrew servant", &amp;c. <a href="/exodus/21-2.htm">Exodus 21:2</a>. A Hebrew servant was sold either against his will, or with it; if a man committed a theft, and he had not wherewith to make restoration, the sanhedrim or magistrates said him: if he was exceeding poor, the law gave him liberty to sell himself; but he might not sell himself as long as he had anything left, even a covering; and after that was gone, he might sell himself; and he was bought with silver or the value of silver or by contract or bond (p); <p>and when he hath served thee six years, thou shall let him go free from thee; or "from with thee" (q); from being with thee, from being in thy house, as well as from being in thy service; he was to be dismissed, so as to go where he pleased, and work for himself, or another, as he thought fit; <p>but your fathers hearkened not unto me, neither inclined their ear; to obey the laws of God, and particularly this concerning servants. This is not to be understood of the fathers with whom the covenant was first made, and to whom this law was first given; but their posterity in later times, who yet lived long before the present generation, and so might with great propriety be called their fathers; and by which it appears that this law had been long neglected. <p>(m) Hilchot Abadim, c. 2. sect. 2.((n) Ibid.

It came to Jeremiah "after King Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people in Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty to them, that every one should send away his man-servant, or his maid-servant, being a Hebrew or Hebrewess, so that none should impose servitude on any one of them who was a Jew, his brother. <a href="/jeremiah/34-10.htm">Jeremiah 34:10</a>. And all the princes and all the people who entered into the covenant obeyed, each one setting free his man-servant and his maid-servant, and not imposing servitude on them any more: they obeyed and each one set them free. <a href="/jeremiah/34-11.htm">Jeremiah 34:11</a>. But they turned round afterwards, and brought back the servants and the handmaids whom they had set free, and brought them under subjection, for servants and for handmaids." The covenant which Zedekiah concluded with all the people at Jerusalem, according to what follows, consisted in a solemn vow made before the Lord in the temple, probably confirmed by sacrifices, to set free the male and female slaves of Hebrew descent, in conformity with the law, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/21-1.htm">Exodus 21:1-4</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/15-12.htm">Deuteronomy 15:12</a>.<p>The law required the gratuitous manumission of these after seven years of service. This time, indeed, is not mentioned in our verses, but it is assumed as well known through the law. But, in the general departure of the people from the Lord and His commandments, the observance of this law had probably long been intermitted, so that, in consequence of the solemn engagement to obey it once more, a great number of Hebrew male and female slaves received their freedom, inasmuch as very many had served longer than seven years; however, we need not suppose that all bond men and women were liberated at once. The resolution, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-9.htm">Jeremiah 34:9</a>, that every one should liberate his Hebrew man-or maid-servant, and that no one should continue to impose servitude on a Jew, his brother, i.e., compel him any longer to serve as a slave, is conditioned by the law, which is assumed as well known: this also accords with the expression &#1500;&#1489;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1470;&#1489;&#1468;&#1501;, which is used in a general way of the treatment of Hebrew men-and maid-servants, <a href="/leviticus/25-39.htm">Leviticus 25:39</a>. However, it is also possible that a liberation of all bond men and women took place without regard to the duration of their servitude, partly for the purpose of averting, by such obedience to the law, the calamity now threatening the city, and partly also to employ the liberated slaves in the defence of the city; for, according to <a href="/jeremiah/34-21.htm">Jeremiah 34:21</a>., the emancipation took place during the siege of Jerusalem, and after the departure of the Chaldeans the solemn promise was revoked. The expression &#1511;&#1514;&#1488; &#1491;&#1512;&#1493;&#1512;, "to proclaim liberty," is taken from <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/25-10.htm">Leviticus 25:10</a>, but it does not prove that the manumission took place on a sabbath-or jubilee-year. &#1500;&#1492;&#1501; refers ad sensum to those who were bondmen and had a right to be set free. The general expression is explained by &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1495; &#1495;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;, and this again is more closely defined by &#1500;&#1489;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1470;&#1489;&#1468;&#1501; (cf. <a href="/leviticus/25-39.htm">Leviticus 25:39</a>). &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;  &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497; &#1488;&#1495;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;, (that no one should labour) "though a Jew, who is his brother," i.e., a fellow-countryman; i.e., that no one should impose servitude on a Jew, as being a compatriot. "To enter into a covenant" is to assume its obligation; cf. <a href="/2_chronicles/15-12.htm">2 Chronicles 15:12</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/16-8.htm">Ezekiel 16:8</a>. The Kethib &#1497;&#1499;&#1489;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1501; receives, in the Qeri, the vowels of the Kal, since the Hiphil of this verb does not occur elsewhere, only the Kal, cf. <a href="/2_chronicles/28-10.htm">2 Chronicles 28:10</a>; but the alteration is unnecessary - the Hiphil may intensify the active meaning. </body></html>
