The most probable explanation of its use is that the prophet coined it as a descriptive word (= land of two rebellions), and then substituted it, after his manner (as with Sheshach, <a href="/jeremiah/25-6.htm" title="And go not after other gods to serve them, and to worship them, and provoke me not to anger with the works of your hands; and I will do you no hurt.">Jeremiah 25:6</a>; Magor-missabib, <a href="/jeremiah/20-3.htm" title="And it came to pass on the morrow, that Pashur brought forth Jeremiah out of the stocks.

Possibly, however, the dual may simply express intensity. Such changes of names were quite after the manner of Old Testament usage. So Beth-aven was substituted for Bethel (<a href="/hosea/10-5.htm" title="The inhabitants of Samaria shall fear because of the calves of Bethaven: for the people thereof shall mourn over it, and the priests thereof that rejoiced on it, for the glory thereof, because it is departed from it.">Hosea 10:5</a>), Mephibosheth for Meribbaal (<a href="/2_samuel/4-4.htm" title="And Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son that was lame of his feet.

Merathaim&#8212;a symbolical name for Babylon, the doubly rebellious, namely, against God. Compare Jer 50:24, "thou hast striven against the Lord"; and Jer 50:29, "proud against the Lord." The "doubly" refers to: first, the Assyrian's oppression of Israel; next, the kindred Chaldean's oppression of Judah (compare Jer 50:17-20, 33; especially Jer 50:18).<p>Pekod&#8212;(Eze 23:23); a chief province of Assyria, in which Nineveh, now overthrown, once lay. But, as in Merathaim, the allusion is to the meaning of Pekod, namely, "visitation"; the inhabitants whose time of deserved visitation in punishment is come; not, however, without reference to the now Babylonian province, Pekod. The visitation on Babylon was a following up of that on Assyria.<p>after them&#8212;even their posterity, and all that is still left of Babylon, until the very name is extinct [Grotius].

The latter are God’s words by his prophet, like the former, commanding him with his armies to go up and destroy them fleeing away, or them that should succeed after them, their whole posterity; intimating God’s design utterly to destroy them, which destruction was gently begun by Cyrus, and perfected by Darius. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/50.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Go up against the land of Merathaim,.... Thought to be the country of the Mardi, which lay part of it in Assyria, and part of it in Armenia; expressed in the dual number, because one part of it lay on one side the Tigris, and the other on the other side. Cyrus, with his army of Medes and Persians, is here called upon; who, according to Herodotus, passed through Assyria to Babylon: and so it may be agreeably rendered, "go by the land of Merathaim"; or the country of the Mardi. Many interpreters take it for an appellative, and not the proper name of a country. The Vulgate Latin version renders it, "the land of rulers"; and the Targum, <p>"the land of the rebellious people;'' <p>and so Kimchi (w): and to the same sense Jarchi, the land <p>"that hath exasperated me, and provoked me to anger;'' <p>meaning the land of the Chaldeans, which had ruled over others, rebelled against the Lord, and provoked him to wrath against it. The word, being in the dual number, may, in the mystical sense, respect the two antichrists, the eastern and western, that have ruled over the nations, and rebelled against God, and provoked him; the Turks and Papists, those two rebels, the beast and false prophet, <a href="/revelation/19-20.htm">Revelation 19:20</a>; against whom the Christian princes will be bid to go up; <p>even against it, and against the inhabitants of Pekod; the name of a place in Assyria; see <a href="/ezekiel/23-23.htm">Ezekiel 23:23</a>; by which also Cyrus might go up to Babylon, so Jarchi; and the Targum takes it to be the name of a place: but Kimchi and others take it to be an appellative; and so it may be rendered, "the inhabitants of visitation" (x); because the time was come to visit and punish them for their sins; and may particularly design the inhabitants of Babylon, the city to be visited for its iniquities; and especially mystical Babylon, which shall come up in remembrance before God, <a href="/revelation/16-19.htm">Revelation 16:19</a>; <p>waste and utterly destroy after them, saith the Lord; either after the destruction of the places before mentioned; or pursue after those that flee and make their escape from thence, and destroy them; or rather their posterity, the remnant of them, as the Targum: <p>and do according to all that I have commanded thee; either Cyrus, according to all the Lord commanded him by the Prophet Isaiah, as Jarchi; or the seven angels, that are to pour out the vials of wrath on antichrist; the kings of the earth, who are to fulfil the will of God upon the man of sin, <a href="/revelation/16-1.htm">Revelation 16:1</a>. <p>(w)   "contra terram rebellantium", Pagninus; "super", Montanus; "contra terram rebellionum", Schmidt.

Probably enough an actual geographical name may lie at the root of this singular expression; but we are not able at present to say what it was. The prophet has, at any rate, modified it in such a way as to convey a definite meaning, symbolic of the character of Babylon (comp. on ver. 31). What was this meaning? According to Gesenius, there is an allusion to the two great blows inflicted on Israel and Judah by Assyria and Babylon respectively; but as these two powers were but the instruments of a higher Hand, this explanation would seem to be inconsistent with the prophetic teaching. Dahler, De Wette, and Keil take the two rebellions to be the spiritual ones of idolatry and pride; and there is no obvious objection to this. But the dual may be simply intended to express intensity; comp. ch. 17:18, "Destroy them with double destruction" (see note). <span class="cmt_word">The inhabitants of Pekod</span>; <span class="accented">i.e</span>. of punishment. But here too a geographical name very probably lies underneath. The Taylor cylinder inscription of Sennacherib mentions a Pukudu (  =   Pekod), together with Havrann (Hauran) and Nabatu (Nabathaeans); but this was the name of a tribe. In <a href="/ezekiel/23-23.htm">Ezekiel 23:23</a> we read, "The Babylonians, and all the Chaldeans, Pekod, and Shoa, and Koa," etc.; and in 'Records of the Past,' 11:92, we find a town Pikudu mentioned, lying to the south of Babylon, which may, perhaps, have given its name to a district, and to this district the prophet not improbably alludes. M. Halevy conjectures that the event which corresponds to the prophecy is the decisive battle which virtually terminated the Babylonian empire. According to the newly discovered Cyrus inscription, this battle was fought near a place called Rutu, which appears to have been situated in the neighbourhood of Pukudu ('Records,' <span class="accented">l.c.</span>). About the symbolic meaning there can be no doubt: Pekod is a worthy pendant to Merathaim. Sin and punishment are so closely connected in the prophetic mind that one word sometimes  covers both notions. It is doubtful, for instance, whether the better rendering of <a href="/isaiah/5-18.htm">Isaiah 5:18</a> is "draw sin as with a cart rope" or "draw punishment." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/50.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In order to execute this judgment on Babylon, the nations are commanded to conquer and destroy the city.

The archers are mentioned by synecdoche, because the point in question is the siege and bombardment of Babylon; cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/13-18.htm">Isaiah 13:18</a>, where the Medes are mentioned as archers. &#1497;&#1491;&#1492; is used only here, in Kal, of the throwing, i.e., the shooting of arrows, instead of &#1497;&#1512;&#1492;, which is elsewhere the usual word for this; and, indeed, some codices have the latter word in this passage.

"It (sc., the destruction of Babylon) is the vengeance of Jahveh." "The vengeance of Jahveh" is an expression derived from <a href="/numbers/31-3.htm">Numbers 31:3</a>. "Avenge yourselves on her," i.e., take retribution for what Babylon has done to other nations, especially to the people of God; cf. 27f. and <a href="/jeremiah/51-11.htm">Jeremiah 51:11</a>. The words, "cut off out of Babylon the sower and the reaper," are not to be restricted to the fields, which, according to the testimonies of Diod. Sic. ii. 7, Pliny xviii. 17, and Curtius <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-1.htm">Jeremiah 51:1</a>, lay within the wall round Babylon, but "Babylon" is the province together with its capital; and the objection of Ngelsbach, that the prophet, in the whole context, is describing the siege of the city of Babylon, is invalid, because <a href="/jeremiah/50-12.htm">Jeremiah 50:12</a> plainly shows that not merely the city, but the province of Babylon, is to become a wilderness, desert, and steppe. The further threat, also, "every one flees to his own people from before the oppressing sword" (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/25-38.htm">Jeremiah 25:38</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/46-16.htm">Jeremiah 46:16</a>), applies not merely to the strangers residing in Babylon, but generally to those in Babylonia. Hitzig would arbitrarily refer these words merely to the husbandmen and field-workers. The fundamental passage, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/13-14.htm">Isaiah 13:14</a>, which Jeremiah had before his mind and repeats verbatim, tells decidedly against this view; cf. also <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-9.htm">Jeremiah 51:9</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/51-44.htm">Jeremiah 51:44</a>.</body></html>
