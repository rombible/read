Dr. Payne Smith infers that Babylon has already fallen, and that the persons addressed are not warriors only, but plunderers of every kind. This is almost too subtle. The prepositions "to" and "against' (literally, upon) are so frequently interchanged (comp. <a href="/jeremiah/46-22.htm">Jeremiah 46:22</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/49-9.htm">Jeremiah 49:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">From the utmost border;</span> rather, <span class="accented">all</span> to<span class="accented">gether</span>; it is an idiom expressing universality. Those who are spoken of are regarded as a totality, "from the utmost end" of which its members come. <span class="cmt_word">Cast her up as heaps;</span> rather, <span class="accented">Cast it up as sheaves</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> ransack the repositories of Babylon's wealth, and heap it up like corn; last of all, <span class="cmt_word">destroy her</span> (rather, <span class="accented">it</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>utterly</span>. The verb is a very emphatic one. Its primary meaning is "to cut off, or shut off." Hence <span class="accented">kherem</span>, a devoted thing, is applied in the Law to that which is "tabooed," as it were, cut off from any but sacred uses. In <a href="/leviticus/27-21.htm">Leviticus 27:21</a> it is used of a field wholly appropriated to the sanctuary, and in <a href="/1_samuel/15-21.htm">1 Samuel 15:21</a> and <a href="/1_kings/20-42.htm">1 Kings 20:42</a> to living beings doomed to destruction. Destruction is generally a part of the meaning; but it is not merely destruction, but an act of homage to the Divine justice. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/50.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Assyrian has already received his punishment for that-the Assyrian kingdom has been destroyed; Babylon will meet with the same punishment, and then (<a href="/jeremiah/50-19.htm">Jeremiah 50:19</a>) Israel will be led back to his pasture-ground. &#1504;&#1493;&#1492;, pasture-ground, grass-plot, where sheep feed, is the land of Israel. Israel, led back thither, will feed on Carmel and Bashan, the most fertile tracts of the country, and the mountains of Ephraim and Gilead, which also furnish fodder in abundance for sheep. As to Gilead, see <a href="/numbers/32-1.htm">Numbers 32:1</a>; <a href="/micah/7-14.htm">Micah 7:14</a>; and in regard to the mountains of Ephraim, <a href="/exodus/34-13.htm">Exodus 34:13</a>., where the feeding on the mountains of Israel and in the valleys is depicted as fat pasture. The mountains of Israel here signify the northern portion of the land generally, including the large and fertile plain of Jezreel, and the different valleys between the several ranges of mountains, which here and there show traces of luxuriant vegetation even yet; cf. Robinson's Physical Geography, p. 120. Then also the guilt of the sins of Israel and Judah shall be blotted out, because the Lord grants pardon to the remnant of His people. This promise points to the time of the New Covenant; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/31-34.htm">Jeremiah 31:34</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/33-8.htm">Jeremiah 33:8</a>. The deliverance of Israel from Babylon coincides with the view given of the regeneration of the people by the Messiah, just as we find throughout the second portion of Isaiah.
