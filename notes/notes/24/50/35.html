This may be applied to believers, who complain of the dominion of sin and corruption, and of their own weakness and manifold infirmities. Their Redeemer is able to keep what they commit to him; and sin shall not have dominion over them. He will give them that rest which remains for the people of God. Also here is Babylon's sin, and their punishment. The sins are, idolatry and persecution. He that will not save his people in their sins, never will countenance the wickedness of his open enemies. The judgments of God for these sins will lay them waste. In the judgments denounced against prosperous Babylon, and the mercies promised to afflicted Israel, we learn to choose to suffer affliction with the people of God, rather than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/50.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Omit "is."

"Summon archers against Jerusalem, all those who bend the bow; encamp against her round about. Let there be no escape for her; recompense to her according to her work; according to that which she hath done, do ye to her: for she hath presumed against Jahveh, against the Holy One of Israel. <a href="/jeremiah/50-30.htm">Jeremiah 50:30</a>. Therefore shall her young men fall in her streets, and all her men of war shall fail in that day, saith Jahveh. <a href="/jeremiah/50-31.htm">Jeremiah 50:31</a>. Behold, I am against thee, O Pride! said the Lord, Jahveh of hosts; for thy day hath come, the time [when] I visit thee. <a href="/jeremiah/50-32.htm">Jeremiah 50:32</a>. And Pride shall stumble and fall, and he shall have none to lift him up; and I will kindle fire in his cities, and it shall devour all that is round about him. <a href="/jeremiah/50-33.htm">Jeremiah 50:33</a>. Thus saith Jahveh of hosts, the Children of Israel and the children of Judah are oppressed together, and all who led them captive kept hold of them; they refused to let them go. <a href="/jeremiah/50-34.htm">Jeremiah 50:34</a>. Their Redeemer is strong; Jahveh of hosts is His name: He shall surely plead their cause, that He may give rest to the earth, and make the inhabitants of Babylon tremble. <a href="/jeremiah/50-35.htm">Jeremiah 50:35</a>.

Archers shall come and besiege Babylon round about, so that no one shall escape. The summons, "Call archers hither," is a dramatic turn in the thought that the siege is quickly to ensue. &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1506; is used here as in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-27.htm">Jeremiah 51:27</a>, to summon, call by making proclamation, as in <a href="/1_kings/15-22.htm">1 Kings 15:22</a>. &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; does not signify "many," as the ancient versions give it; this agrees neither with the apposition which follows, "all that bend the bow," nor with <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-26.htm">Jeremiah 50:26</a>, where all, to the last, are summoned against Babylon. Raschi, followed by all the moderns, more correctly renders it "archers," and derives it from &#1512;&#1489;&#1492;  equals  &#1512;&#1489;&#1489;, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/49-23.htm">Genesis 49:23</a>, cf. with <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-10.htm">Jeremiah 21:10</a>, like &#1512;&#1489;, <a href="/job/16-13.htm">Job 16:13</a>. The apposition, "all those who bend the bow," gives additional force. &#1495;&#1504;&#1492; with accus. means to besiege; cf. <a href="/psalms/53-6.htm">Psalm 53:6</a>. "Let there be no escape" is equivalent to saying, "that none may escape from Babylon." The Qeri &#1500;&#1492;&#1468; after &#1497;&#1492;&#1497; is unnecessary, and merely taken from <a href="/jeremiah/50-26.htm">Jeremiah 50:26</a>. On the expression "render to her," etc., cf. <a href="/jeremiah/25-14.htm">Jeremiah 25:14</a>; and on "according to all," etc., f. <a href="/jeremiah/50-15.htm">Jeremiah 50:15</a>. "For she hath acted presumptuously against Jahveh," by burning His temple, and keeping His people captive: in this way has Babylon offended "against the Holy One of Israel." This epithet of God is taken from Isaiah, cf. <a href="/isaiah/51-5.htm">Isaiah 51:5</a>. This presumption must be punished.</body></html>
