Merathaim&#8212;a symbolical name for Babylon, the doubly rebellious, namely, against God. Compare Jer 50:24, "thou hast striven against the Lord"; and Jer 50:29, "proud against the Lord." The "doubly" refers to: first, the Assyrian's oppression of Israel; next, the kindred Chaldean's oppression of Judah (compare Jer 50:17-20, 33; especially Jer 50:18).<p>Pekod&#8212;(Eze 23:23); a chief province of Assyria, in which Nineveh, now overthrown, once lay. But, as in Merathaim, the allusion is to the meaning of Pekod, namely, "visitation"; the inhabitants whose time of deserved visitation in punishment is come; not, however, without reference to the now Babylonian province, Pekod. The visitation on Babylon was a following up of that on Assyria.<p>after them&#8212;even their posterity, and all that is still left of Babylon, until the very name is extinct [Grotius].

The archers are to place themselves round about Babylon, and shoot at the city unsparingly. &#1506;&#1512;&#1498; does not mean to prepare oneself, but to prepare &#1502;&#1500;&#1495;&#1502;&#1492;, the battle, combat. The archers are mentioned by synecdoche, because the point in question is the siege and bombardment of Babylon; cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/13-18.htm">Isaiah 13:18</a>, where the Medes are mentioned as archers. &#1497;&#1491;&#1492; is used only here, in Kal, of the throwing, i.e., the shooting of arrows, instead of &#1497;&#1512;&#1492;, which is elsewhere the usual word for this; and, indeed, some codices have the latter word in this passage. "Spare not the arrow," i.e., do not spare an arrow; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/51-3.htm">Jeremiah 51:3</a>. &#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1506;, to cry aloud; here, to raise a battle-cry; cf. <a href="/joshua/6-16.htm">Joshua 6:16</a>. The effect and result of the cry is, "she hath given her hand," i.e., given herself up. &#1504;&#1514;&#1503; &#1497;&#1491; usually signifies the giving of the hand as a pledge of faithfulness (<a href="/2_kings/10-15.htm">2 Kings 10:15</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/17-18.htm">Ezekiel 17:18</a>; <a href="/ezra/10-19.htm">Ezra 10:19</a>), from which is derived the meaning of giving up, delivering up oneself; cf. <a href="/2_chronicles/30-8.htm">2 Chronicles 30:8</a>. Cf. Cornelius Nepos, Hamilc. c. 1, donec victi manum dedissent.

Here the word signifies the supports of the city, i.e., the fortifications of Babylon, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, propugnacula, pinnae, the battlements of the city wall, not the foundations of the walls, for which &#1504;&#1508;&#1500; is unsuitable. "It (sc., the destruction of Babylon) is the vengeance of Jahveh." "The vengeance of Jahveh" is an expression derived from <a href="/numbers/31-3.htm">Numbers 31:3</a>. "Avenge yourselves on her," i.e., take retribution for what Babylon has done to other nations, especially to the people of God; cf. 27f. and <a href="/jeremiah/51-11.htm">Jeremiah 51:11</a>. The words, "cut off out of Babylon the sower and the reaper," are not to be restricted to the fields, which, according to the testimonies of Diod. Sic. ii. 7, Pliny xviii. 17, and Curtius <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-1.htm">Jeremiah 51:1</a>, lay within the wall round Babylon, but "Babylon" is the province together with its capital; and the objection of Ngelsbach, that the prophet, in the whole context, is describing the siege of the city of Babylon, is invalid, because <a href="/jeremiah/50-12.htm">Jeremiah 50:12</a> plainly shows that not merely the city, but the province of Babylon, is to become a wilderness, desert, and steppe. The further threat, also, "every one flees to his own people from before the oppressing sword" (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/25-38.htm">Jeremiah 25:38</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/46-16.htm">Jeremiah 46:16</a>), applies not merely to the strangers residing in Babylon, but generally to those in Babylonia. Hitzig would arbitrarily refer these words merely to the husbandmen and field-workers. The fundamental passage, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/13-14.htm">Isaiah 13:14</a>, which Jeremiah had before his mind and repeats verbatim, tells decidedly against this view; cf. also <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-9.htm">Jeremiah 51:9</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/51-44.htm">Jeremiah 51:44</a>.</body></html>
