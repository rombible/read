"Tell it among the nations, and cause it to be heard, and lift up a standard; cause it to be heard, conceal it not: say, Babylon is taken, Bel is ashamed, Merodach is confounded; her images are ashamed, her idols are confounded. <a href="/jeremiah/50-3.htm">Jeremiah 50:3</a>. For there hath come up against her a nation out of the north; it will make her land a desolation, and there shall be not an inhabitant in it: from man to beast, [all] have fled, are gone. <a href="/jeremiah/50-4.htm">Jeremiah 50:4</a>. In those days, and at that time, saith Jahveh, the children of Israel shall come, they and the children of Judah together; they shall go, weeping as they go, and shall seek Jahveh their God. <a href="/jeremiah/50-5.htm">Jeremiah 50:5</a>. They shall ask for Zion, with their faces [turned to] the road hitherwards, [saying], Come, and let us join ourselves to Jahveh by an eternal covenant [which] shall not be forgotten. <a href="/jeremiah/50-6.htm">Jeremiah 50:6</a>. My people have been a flock of lost ones; their shepherds have misled them [on] mountains which lead astray: from mountain to hill they went; they forgot their resting-place. <a href="/jeremiah/50-7.htm">Jeremiah 50:7</a>.

For, behold, I will stir up, and bring up against Babylon, an assembly of great nations out of the land of the north: and they shall array themselves against her; on that side shall she be taken: his arrows [are] like [those of] a skilful hero [who] does not return empty. <a href="/jeremiah/50-10.htm">Jeremiah 50:10</a>. And [the land of the] Chaldeans shall become a spoil; all those who spoil her shall be satisfied, saith Jahveh."<p>In the spirit Jeremiah sees the fall of Babylon, together with its idols, as if it had actually taken place, and gives the command to proclaim among the nations this event, which brings deliverance for Israel and Judah. The joy over this is expressed in the accumulation of the words for the summons to tell the nations what has happened. On the expression, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-5.htm">Jeremiah 4:5-6</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/46-14.htm">Jeremiah 46:14</a>. The lifting up of a standard, i.e., of a signal-rod, served for the more rapid spreading of news; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/4-6.htm">Jeremiah 4:6</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-1.htm">Jeremiah 6:1</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/13-2.htm">Isaiah 13:2</a>, etc. "Cause it to be heard" is intensified by the addition of "do not conceal it." The thing is to be proclaimed without reserve; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/38-14.htm">Jeremiah 38:14</a>. "Babylon is taken," i.e., conquered, and her idols have become ashamed, inasmuch as, from their inability to save their city, their powerlessness and nullity have come to light. Bel and Merodach are not different divinities, but merely different names for the chief deity of the Babylonians. Bel  equals  Baal, the Jupiter of the Babylonians, was, as Bel-merodach, the tutelary god of Babylon. "The whole of the Babylonian dynasty," says Oppert, Expd. en Msopot. ii. p. 272, "places him [Merodach] at the head of the gods; and the inscription of Borsippa calls him the king of heaven and earth." &#1506;&#1510;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, "images of idols," and &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, properly "logs," an expression of contempt for idols (see on <a href="/leviticus/26-30.htm">Leviticus 26:30</a>), are synonymous ideas for designating the nature and character of the Babylonian gods.</body></html>
