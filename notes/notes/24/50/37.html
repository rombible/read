Here it is used of the auxiliaries of Babylon, which were probably as numerous, and to a large extent the same, as those of Persia.

The “treasures” point to the wealth in which Babylon exulted, and which gave to her the epithet of the “Golden City” (<a href="/isaiah/14-4.htm" title="That you shall take up this proverb against the king of Babylon, and say, How has the oppressor ceased! the golden city ceased!">Isaiah 14:4</a>).

This may be applied to believers, who complain of the dominion of sin and corruption, and of their own weakness and manifold infirmities. Their Redeemer is able to keep what they commit to him; and sin shall not have dominion over them. He will give them that rest which remains for the people of God. Also here is Babylon's sin, and their punishment. The sins are, idolatry and persecution. He that will not save his people in their sins, never will countenance the wickedness of his open enemies. The judgments of God for these sins will lay them waste. In the judgments denounced against prosperous Babylon, and the mercies promised to afflicted Israel, we learn to choose to suffer affliction with the people of God, rather than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/50.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The mingled people - i. e., the foreigners serving as mercenaries in her army. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/50.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>37. as women&#8212;divested of all manliness (Na 3:13).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/50.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">A sword is upon their horses, and upon their chariots; </span> though they be full of chariots and horses, the enemy shall destroy them.

The Lord will now visit the presumption of Babylon. The day of punishment has arrived. On "behold, I am against thee," cf. <a href="/jeremiah/21-13.htm">Jeremiah 21:13</a>. "O arrogance, pride!" is directly addressed to Babylon: in <a href="/jeremiah/50-32.htm">Jeremiah 50:32</a> also there is a like designation of Babylon as the personification of pride. On the words "for thy day is come," cf. <a href="/jeremiah/50-27.htm">Jeremiah 50:27</a>.

The former, indeed, is the reading rendered by the lxx in this passage; but they have acted quite arbitrarily in this, since Jeremiah, for the most part, varies individual words when he repeats a thought. "In his cities" does not suit very well, inasmuch as the other cities of the country belonged to Babylon, the &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; as hers, and in <a href="/jeremiah/51-43.htm">Jeremiah 51:43</a> they are spoken of as hers; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/19-15.htm">Jeremiah 19:15</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/34-1.htm">Jeremiah 34:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-13.htm">Jeremiah 49:13</a>, etc.</body></html>
