Here, however, as Babylon is the object of attack, the latter allusion is scarcely applicable, and there is no sufficient reason for altering the English version.

Babylon had the extent rather of a nation than of a city. Therefore grain was grown within the city wall sufficient to last for a long siege [Aristotle, Politics, 3.2; Pliny, 18.17].

Both sower and reaper: the walls of Babylon took in a large compass of land, where there were corn fields; and which, as Curtius (s) observes, would yield a sufficiency to hold out a siege against an enemy; but being taken, the husbandman would not be spared, as used to be, but should be cut off, and so none to till the ground, or to reap what was upon it; and thus, in course, would be, desolate, as before threatened. The Targum understands this in a figurative sense, <p>"destroy the king out of Babylon, and take hold of the sword in the time of slaughter;'' <p>and Cocceius interprets the sower of any doctor or bishop in mystical Babylon, and the reaper of such that gather the fruits, and exact obedience; see <a href="/revelation/18-14.htm">Revelation 18:14</a>; <p>for fear of the oppressing sword; of the Medes and Persians: <p>they shall turn everyone to his people, and they shall flee everyone to his own land; not those of other nations, as the Jews, who were detained captives there, as Kimchi thinks; for these were not in such fear of the Persians, nor did they flee because of them; but were let go by them, and sent into their own land honourably: but either such who, of other nations, were come to traffic at Babylon; or rather the auxiliaries of other nations, who were either hired or forced into the service of Babylon; these, finding the city taken, would make the best of their way into their own country. <p>(s) Hist. l. 5. c. 1.<a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/50.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Cut off the <span class="cverse3">{q}</span> sower from Babylon, and him that handleth the sickle in the time of harvest: for fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn every one to his people, and they shall flee every one to his own land.</span><p>(q) Destroy her so that no one is left to work the ground or to take the fruit of it.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/50.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">16</span>. <span class="ital">Cut off the sower from Babylon</span>] Agricultural labour ceases, and foreign residents flee to their homes.

H. Michaelis, in his Biblia Halens., has accepted the reading &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500; on the authority of three Erfurt codices and three old editions (a Veneta of 1618; Buxtorf's Rabbinic Bible, printed at Basle, 1720; and the London Polyglott). J. D. Michaelis, Rosenmller, Maurer, and Umbreit have decided for this reading, and point to the rendering of the Vulgate, interfectoris, and of the Targum, &#1502;&#1514;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;, orbans. On the other hand, the lxx and Syriac have read and rendered &#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;; and this reading is not merely presented by nonnulli libri, as Maurer states, but by twelve codices of de Rossi, and all the more ancient editions of the Bible, of which de Rossi in his variae lectiones mentions forty-one. The critical witnesses are thus overwhelming for &#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;; and against &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500; there lies the further consideration, that &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1500; has the meaning orbare, to render childless, only in the Piel, but in the Hiphil means abortare, to cause or have miscarriages, as is shown by &#1512;&#1495;&#1501; &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;, <a href="/hosea/9-14.htm">Hosea 9:14</a>.)<p>The words &#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; do not permit of being referred, on the strength of <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-22.htm">2 Samuel 1:22</a>, to one particular arrow which does not come back empty; for the verb &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;, though perhaps suitable enough for the sword, which is drawn back when it has executed the blow, is inappropriate for the arrow, which does not return.
