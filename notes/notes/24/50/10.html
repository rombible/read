The fall of Babylon has the deliverance of Israel as its direct result. The prophet views this in such a way, that all the steps in the fulfilment (the return from Babylon, the reunion of the tribes previously separated, their sincere return to the Lord, and the making of a new covenant that shall endure for ever), which will actually follow successively in long periods, are taken together into one view. By the statement made regarding the time, "In those days, and at that time," the fall of Babylon and the deliverance of Israel (which Jeremiah sees in the spirit as already begun) are marked out as belonging to the future. Israel and Judah come together, divided no more; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/3-18.htm">Jeremiah 3:18</a>. "Going and weeping they go," i.e., they always go further on, weeping: cf. <a href="/jeremiah/41-6.htm">Jeremiah 41:6</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/3-16.htm">2 Samuel 3:16</a>; Ewald, 280, b. Cf. also <a href="/jeremiah/3-21.htm">Jeremiah 3:21</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/31-9.htm">Jeremiah 31:9</a>. Seeking the Lord their God, they ask for Zion, i.e., they ask after the way thither; for in Zion Jahveh has His throne. "The way hither" (i.e., to Jerusalem) "is their face," sc. directed. "Hither" points to the place of the speaker, Jerusalem. &#1489;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; are imperatives, and words with which those who are returning encourage one another to a close following of the Lord their God. &#1504;&#1500;&#1493;&#1493;&#1468; is imperative for &#1497;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1493;&#1468;, like &#1504;&#1511;&#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468; in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/43-9.htm">Isaiah 43:9</a>, <a href="/joel/3-11.htm">Joel 3:11</a>; cf. Ewald, 226, c. It cannot be the imperfect, because the third person gives no sense; hence Graf would change the vowels, and read &#1504;&#1500;&#1493;&#1492;. But suspicion is raised against this by the very fact that, excepting <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:15</a>, &#1500;&#1493;&#1492;, in the sense of joining oneself to, depending on, occurs only in the Niphal. &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501; is a modal accusative: "in an eternal covenant which shall not be forgotten," i.e., which we will not forget, will not break again. In fact, this is the new covenant which the Lord, according to <a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31</a>., will make in time to come with His people. But here this side of the matter is withdrawn from consideration; for the point treated of is merely what Israel, in his repentant frame and returning to God, vows he shall do.<p>Israel comes to this determination in consequence of the misery into which he has fallen because of his sins, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-5.htm">Jeremiah 50:5-7</a>. Israel was like a flock of lost sheep which their shepherds had led astray. &#1510;&#1488;&#1503; , a flock of sheep that are going to ruin. The participle in the plural is joined with the collective noun ad sensum, to show what is imminent or is beginning to happen. The verb &#1492;&#1497;&#1492; points to the subject &#1510;&#1488;&#1503;; hence the Qeri &#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468; is unnecessary. The plural suffixes of the following clause refer to &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497; as a collective. The shepherds led the people of God astray on &#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1489;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; (a local accusative; on the Kethib &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1489;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501;, cf. <a href="/jeremiah/31-32.htm">Jeremiah 31:32</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/49-4.htm">Jeremiah 49:4</a>; it is not to be read &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1489;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501;), mountains that render people faithless. These mountains were so designated because they were the seats of that idolatry which had great power of attraction for a sinful people, so that the seduction or alienation of the people from their God is ascribed to them. &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1489;&#1489; is used in the sense which the verb has in <a href="/isaiah/47-10.htm">Isaiah 47:10</a>. The Qeri &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1489;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; gives the less appropriate idea, "the shepherds made the sheep stray." Hitzig's translation, "they drove them along the mountain," does to suit the verb &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1489;&#1489;. Moreover, the mountains in themselves do not form unsuitable pasture-ground for sheep, and &#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; does not mean "a bare, desolate mountain-range." The objection to our view of &#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, that there is no very evident proof that worship on high places is referred to (Graf), is pure fancy, and the reverse only is true. For the words which follow, "they (the sheep) went from mountain to hill, and forgot their resting-place," have no meaning whatever, unless they are understood of the idolatrous dealings of Israel. The resting-place of the sheep (&#1512;&#1489;&#1495;&#1501;, the place where the flocks lie down to rest), according to <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-7.htm">Jeremiah 50:7</a>, is Jahveh, the hope of their fathers. Their having forgotten this resting-place is the result of their going from mountain to hill: these words undeniably point to the idolatry of the people on every high hill (<a href="/jeremiah/2-20.htm">Jeremiah 2:20</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/3-2.htm">Jeremiah 3:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-2.htm">Jeremiah 17:2</a>, etc.).</body></html>
