The mercy promised to the Israel of God, shall not only accompany, but arise from the destruction of Babylon. These sheep shall be gathered from the deserts, and put again into good pasture.

But the last words seem to guide us to a larger sense of the term <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">iniquity, </span> and to point us to another sense of the whole former phrase, viz. that God would no longer punish the sins of the Jews; they should be sought for as to punishment, and not found.

When mystical Babylon shall be destroyed, and the Jews will be converted and brought into their land, and be in possession of every temporal and spiritual mercy; it will then most clearly appear that they are the favourites of heaven, and all their sins are forgiven them, as follows: <p>the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be none;  <p>and the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found; not that they will be wholly free from sin; or there will be none in them; or none committed by them; or that their sins are no sins; or that God has no sight or knowledge of them; but that they will not be found upon them, so as to be charged on them in a judicial way; having been removed from them to Christ, and satisfaction made for them by him; who has finished them, and made an end of them, so as that no condemnation or punishment can be inflicted on them for them; wherefore, should they be sought for by Satan, or by the law and justice of God, they will never be found, so as to be brought against them to their condemnation. The reason is, <p>for I will pardon them whom I reserve; the remnant, according to the election of grace, whom God has chosen in Christ, preserved in him, and reserved for himself, for his own glory, and for eternal happiness; these are pardoned freely for Christ's sake; and being pardoned, no sin is imputed to them; all is removed from them, as far as the east is from the west; covered out of the sight of God; hid from the eye of avenging justice; blotted out as a debt book, which is not legible, or as a cloud which is no more; cast by the Lord behind his back, and into the depths of the sea, and entirely forgotten; never remembered or seen more, but buried in everlasting oblivion and obscurity; see <a href="/romans/11-27.htm">Romans 11:27</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/50.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">In those days, and in that time, saith the LORD, the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be none; and the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found: for I will pardon them whom I reserve.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/50.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">20</span>. <span class="ital">In those days, and in that time, etc</span>.] See on ch. <a href="/jeremiah/23-5.htm" title="Behold, the days come, said the LORD, that I will raise to David a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper, and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth.">Jeremiah 23:5</a> and cp. <a href="/jeremiah/31-34.htm" title="And they shall teach no more every man his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, Know the LORD: for they shall all know me, from the least of them to the greatest of them, said the LORD: for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.">Jeremiah 31:34</a>; <a href="/micah/7-18.htm" title="Who is a God like to you, that pardons iniquity, and passes by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? he retains not his anger for ever, because he delights in mercy.">Micah 7:18</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">whom I leave</span>] those who come forth at the end out of the long tribulation.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/50.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In those days,</span> etc. An evangelical promise, reminding us of <a href="/jeremiah/31-34.htm">Jeremiah 31:34</a> and Jeremiah 33:8, and of the combination of spiritual with temporal blessings in the latter part of Isaiah. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/50.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In order to execute this judgment on Babylon, the nations are commanded to conquer and destroy the city.

The archers are mentioned by synecdoche, because the point in question is the siege and bombardment of Babylon; cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/13-18.htm">Isaiah 13:18</a>, where the Medes are mentioned as archers. &#1497;&#1491;&#1492; is used only here, in Kal, of the throwing, i.e., the shooting of arrows, instead of &#1497;&#1512;&#1492;, which is elsewhere the usual word for this; and, indeed, some codices have the latter word in this passage. "Spare not the arrow," i.e., do not spare an arrow; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/51-3.htm">Jeremiah 51:3</a>. &#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1506;, to cry aloud; here, to raise a battle-cry; cf. <a href="/joshua/6-16.htm">Joshua 6:16</a>. The effect and result of the cry is, "she hath given her hand," i.e., given herself up. &#1504;&#1514;&#1503; &#1497;&#1491; usually signifies the giving of the hand as a pledge of faithfulness (<a href="/2_kings/10-15.htm">2 Kings 10:15</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/17-18.htm">Ezekiel 17:18</a>; <a href="/ezra/10-19.htm">Ezra 10:19</a>), from which is derived the meaning of giving up, delivering up oneself; cf. <a href="/2_chronicles/30-8.htm">2 Chronicles 30:8</a>.

Here the word signifies the supports of the city, i.e., the fortifications of Babylon, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, propugnacula, pinnae, the battlements of the city wall, not the foundations of the walls, for which &#1504;&#1508;&#1500; is unsuitable. "It (sc., the destruction of Babylon) is the vengeance of Jahveh." "The vengeance of Jahveh" is an expression derived from <a href="/numbers/31-3.htm">Numbers 31:3</a>. "Avenge yourselves on her," i.e., take retribution for what Babylon has done to other nations, especially to the people of God; cf. 27f. and <a href="/jeremiah/51-11.htm">Jeremiah 51:11</a>. The words, "cut off out of Babylon the sower and the reaper," are not to be restricted to the fields, which, according to the testimonies of Diod. Sic. ii. 7, Pliny xviii. 17, and Curtius <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-1.htm">Jeremiah 51:1</a>, lay within the wall round Babylon, but "Babylon" is the province together with its capital; and the objection of Ngelsbach, that the prophet, in the whole context, is describing the siege of the city of Babylon, is invalid, because <a href="/jeremiah/50-12.htm">Jeremiah 50:12</a> plainly shows that not merely the city, but the province of Babylon, is to become a wilderness, desert, and steppe. The further threat, also, "every one flees to his own people from before the oppressing sword" (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/25-38.htm">Jeremiah 25:38</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/46-16.htm">Jeremiah 46:16</a>), applies not merely to the strangers residing in Babylon, but generally to those in Babylonia. Hitzig would arbitrarily refer these words merely to the husbandmen and field-workers. The fundamental passage, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/13-14.htm">Isaiah 13:14</a>, which Jeremiah had before his mind and repeats verbatim, tells decidedly against this view; cf. also <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-9.htm">Jeremiah 51:9</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/51-44.htm">Jeremiah 51:44</a>.</body></html>
