In the next chapter a similar title is conferred upon Israel, with the right to retaliate upon Babylon all the evil which Babylon had done to Zion (<a href="/jeremiah/51-20.htm">Jeremiah 51:20-24</a>). Compare the epithet <span class="accented">Martel</span>, "The Hammer," given to Charles, Duke of the Franks, on account of his great victory over the Saraoens at Tours; it is tempting to add "Makkabi," the epithet of Judas (Maccabaeus), but the <span class="accented">k</span> is not the same letter as that in <span class="accented">maqqab</span>, hammer. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/50.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>This judgment comes on Babylon because of her oppression and scattering of the people of Israel, whom the Lord will now feed in peace again on their native soil. Israel is like &#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1508;&#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492;, a sheep which, having been scared away out of its stall or fold, is hunted into the wide world; cf. &#1508;&#1468;&#1494;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; &#1489;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="/joel/3-2.htm">Joel 3:2</a>. Although &#1508;&#1468;&#1494;&#1512;, "to scatter," implies the conception of a flock, yet we cannot take &#1513;&#1474;&#1492; as a collective (Graf), since it is nomen unitatis. The point in the comparison lies on the fact that Israel has been hunted, like a solitary sheep, up and down among the beasts of the earth; and pizeer is more exactly specified by the following clause, "lions have chased after it." The object of &#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468; is easily derived from the context, so that we do not need to follow Hitzig in changing &#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468; &#1492;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503; into &#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492; &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503;. These kings are, the king of Assyria first, and the king of Babylon last. The former has dispersed the ten tribes among the heathen; the latter, by destroying the kingdom of Judah, and carrying away its inhabitants, has shattered the theocracy. The verbs apply to the figure of the lion, and the suffixes refer to Israel. &#1488;&#1499;&#1500; is used of the devouring of the flesh; &#1506;&#1510;&#1468;&#1501; is a denominative from &#1506;&#1510;&#1501;, and means the same as &#1490;&#1468;&#1512;&#1501;, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/24-8.htm">Numbers 24:8</a>, to break bones in pieces, not merely gnaw them. So long as the flesh only is eaten, the skeleton of bones remains; if these also be broken, the animal is quite destroyed.</body></html>
