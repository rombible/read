The name of Bel appears in the names of the two great walls of Babylon, Imgur-Bel and Nimetti-Bel (<span class= "ital">Records of the Past, v.</span> 125).

If our friends are God's enemies, we dare not speak peace to them. The destruction of Babylon is spoken of as done thoroughly. Here is a word for the comfort of the Jews. They shall return to their God first, then to their own land; the promise of their conversion and reformation makes way for the other promises. Their tears flow not from the sorrow of the world, as when they went into captivity, but from godly sorrow. They shall seek after the Lord as their God, and have no more to do with idols. They shall think of returning to their own country. This represents the return of poor souls to God. In true converts there are sincere desires to attain the end, and constant cares to keep in the way. Their present case is lamented as very sad.

The taking of Babylon; a piece of news, in which the nations of the world had a concern, as well as the Jews, being brought under the Babylonish yoke, from which they would now be freed; and therefore such a declaration must be very acceptable and joyful to them. Some take these words to be the words of God to the prophet; others, the words of Jeremiah to the nations; the meaning is only, that such a declaration should be made, and such things done, as follow: <p>and publish, and set up a standard; publish, and conceal not; cause it to be heard far and near; and, that it may be heard, set up a sign or standard, to gather the people together to hear it; for this standard was not to be set up for the enlisting of men, or gathering them together, to go up and fight against Babylon, since it was now taken; but as a token of victory, and as expressive joy, on account of it; or rather for the reason given; see <a href="/isaiah/13-2.htm">Isaiah 13:2</a>; <p>say, Babylon is taken; this is the thing to be declared, published, and not concealed; but with an audible voice to be pronounced, and rung throughout the several nations of the earth. Thus, when the everlasting Gospel is preached to every nation on earth, and Christ is set up in it as an ensign and standard to the people; it shall be everywhere published, "Babylon is fallen, is fallen", <a href="/revelation/14-6.htm">Revelation 14:6</a>; <p>Bel is confounded; an idol of the Babylonians, thought by some to be the same with Baal by contraction; he is by the Septuagint called Belus, the name of one of their kings; who might be idolized after his death, as was usual among the Heathen lions: he is said to be "confounded", because he must have been, could he have been sensible of the taking of Babylon, where his temple stood, and he was worshipped, since he was not able to protect it; or rather, because his worshippers were confounded, that gloried in him, and put their trust in him.

Bel, it is true, was originally distinct from Merodach, but ultimately identified with him. Merodach was the tutelary god of Babylon, and Nebuchadnezzar seems to have been specially addicted to his worship, though, indeed, he mentions Nebo also with hardly less honour. This is the beginning of an inscription of this king's, preserved at the India House: - "Nebuchadnezzar, King of Babylon, glorious prince, worshipper of Marduk, adorer of the lofty one, glorifier of Nabu, the exalted, the <span class="accented">possessor</span> of intelligence" (Mr. Rodwell's translation, 'Records of the Past,' 5:113). Elsewhere Nebuchadnezzar speaks of Marduk as "the god my maker," "the chief of the gods," and of himself as "his (Marduk's) eldest son, the chosen of his heart." Her images. It is a very peculiar word (<span class="accented">gillulim</span>), specially frequent in Ezekiel, and also found in a chapter of Leviticus with which Ezekiel has affinities (<a href="/leviticus/26-30.htm">Leviticus 26:30</a>). It evidently involves a sore disparagement of idol worship. The etymological meaning is "things rolled," which may be variously interpreted as "idol blocks" (Gesenius), or "doll images" (Ewald). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/49.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Thus saith Jahveh of hosts: Behold, I will break the bow of Elam, the chief part of their strength. <a href="/jeremiah/49-36.htm">Jeremiah 49:36</a>. And I will bring upon Elam four winds from the four ends of the heaven, and I will scatter them towards all these winds; and there shall be no nation where the scattered ones of Elam shall not come. <a href="/jeremiah/49-37.htm">Jeremiah 49:37</a>.

And I will place my throne in Elam, and will destroy thence king and princes, saith Jahveh. <a href="/jeremiah/49-39.htm">Jeremiah 49:39</a>. But it shall be in the end of the days, that I will turn the captivity of Elam, saith Jahveh."<p>Elam's martial power is to be destroyed, and its population scattered to the four winds among all nations (<a href="/jeremiah/49-25.htm">Jeremiah 49:25</a>.). The Lord will make them terrified before their enemies, and let them be pursued by the sword till they are swept away (<a href="/jeremiah/49-37.htm">Jeremiah 49:37</a>). In the country itself He will hold a tribunal, and destroy king and priests out of it (<a href="/jeremiah/49-38.htm">Jeremiah 49:38</a>). In <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-35.htm">Jeremiah 49:35</a>, the bow, as the chief weapon of the Elamites (cf. <a href="/isaiah/22-6.htm">Isaiah 22:6</a>), is mentioned, by synecdoche, instead of all offensive and defensive weapons, for all the means of resistance and attack employed by this warlike nation. This, indeed, is shown by the apposition, "the first-fruits (i.e., the chief part) of their strength" or valour. To break the bow in pieces is thus equivalent to rendering defenceless. The plural suffix in &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;&#1501; points to Elam as a nation - the Elamites. Hitzig, Graf, and older expositors make an assumption which is both unnecessary and incapable of proof, that &#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514; stands for &#1490;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, and means "the valiant, brave people of war," as in <a href="/isaiah/21-17.htm">Isaiah 21:17</a> and <a href="/1_samuel/2-4.htm">1 Samuel 2:4</a>; but neither in these passages can the alleged meaning be fully made out.</body></html>
