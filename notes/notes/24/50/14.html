The Kethib &#1497;&#1510;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; may be vindicated, because the direct address pretty often makes a sudden transition into the language of the third person.

The simile, "like he-goats before the flock," does not mean that Israel is to press forward that he may save himself before any one else (Graf), but that Israel is to go before all, as an example and leader in the flight (Ngelsbach).</body></html>
