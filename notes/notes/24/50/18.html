The cause of this destruction is the wrath of the Lord. Babylon shall be wholly desolated; for she hath sinned against the Lord. Sin makes men a mark for the arrows of God's judgments. The mercy promised to the Israel of God, shall not only accompany, but arise from the destruction of Babylon. These sheep shall be gathered from the deserts, and put again into good pasture. All who return to God and their duty, shall find satisfaction of soul in so doing.

Your mother will be very much ashamed; she who bare you will blush: behold, the last of the nations [will be] a wilderness, a desert, and a steppe. <a href="/jeremiah/50-13.htm">Jeremiah 50:13</a>. Because of the indignation of Jahveh it shall not be inhabited, and it shall become a complete desolation. Every one passing by Babylon will be astonished, and hiss because of all her plagues. <a href="/jeremiah/50-14.htm">Jeremiah 50:14</a>. Make preparations against Babylon round about, all ye that bend the bow; shoot at her, do not spare an arrow, for she hath sinned against Jahveh. <a href="/jeremiah/50-15.htm">Jeremiah 50:15</a>. Shout against her round about; she hath given herself up: her battlements are fallen, her walls are pulled down; for it is Jahveh's vengeance: revenge yourselves on her; as she hath done, do ye to her. <a href="/jeremiah/50-16.htm">Jeremiah 50:16</a>. Cut off the sower from Babylon, and him that handles the sickle in the time of harvest. From before the oppressing sword each one will turn to his own nation, and each one will flee to his own land. <a href="/jeremiah/50-17.htm">Jeremiah 50:17</a>. Israel is a scattered sheep [which] lions have driven away: the first [who] devoured him [was] the king of Babylon; and this, the last, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, hath broken his bones. <a href="/jeremiah/50-18.htm">Jeremiah 50:18</a>.

Not only is the translation, "for thou didst rejoice," etc., difficult to connect with the imperfects of all the verbs in the verse, but the direct address also does not suit <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-10.htm">Jeremiah 50:10</a>, and rather demands connection with <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-12.htm">Jeremiah 50:12</a>, where it is continued. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, of course, introduces the reason, yet not in such a way that <a href="/jeremiah/50-11.htm">Jeremiah 50:11</a> states the cause why Chaldea shall become a spoil, but rather so that <a href="/jeremiah/50-11.htm">Jeremiah 50:11</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/50-12.htm">Jeremiah 50:12</a> together give the reason for the threatening uttered. The different clauses of <a href="/jeremiah/50-11.htm">Jeremiah 50:11</a> are the protases, to which <a href="/jeremiah/50-12.htm">Jeremiah 50:12</a> brings the apodosis. "You may go on making merry over the defeat of Israel, but shame will follow for this." The change of the singular forms of the verbs into plurals (Qeri) has been caused by the plural '&#1513;&#1473;&#1505;&#1497; , but is unnecessary, because Babylon is regarded as a collective, and its people are gathered into the unity of a person; see on <a href="/jeremiah/13-20.htm">Jeremiah 13:20</a>. "Spoilers of mine inheritance," i.e., of the people and land of the Lord; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/12-7.htm">Jeremiah 12:7</a>; <a href="/isaiah/17-14.htm">Isaiah 17:14</a>. On &#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;, to gallop (of a horse, <a href="/habakkuk/1-8.htm">Habakkuk 1:8</a>), hop, spring (of a calf, <a href="/malachi/3-20.htm">Malachi 3:20</a>), see on <a href="/habakkuk/1-8.htm">Habakkuk 1:8</a>. &#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488; is rendered by the lxx &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;, by the Vulgate super herbam; after these, Ewald also takes the meaning of springing like a calf through the grass, since he explains &#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;  as exhibiting the correct punctuation, and remarks that &#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;, like &#1492;&#1500;&#1498;, can stand with an object directly after it; see 282, a. Most modern expositors, on the other hand, take &#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488; as the fem. participle from &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;, written with &#1488; instead of &#1492;: "like a threshing heifer." On this, A Schultens, in his Animadv. philol., on this passage, remarks: Comparatio petita est a vitula, quae in area media inter frumenta, ore ex lege non ligato (<a href="/deuteronomy/25-10.htm">Deuteronomy 25:10</a>), prae pabuli abundantia gestit ex exsultat. This explanation also gives a suitable meaning, without compelling us to do violence to the language and to alter the text. As to &#1488;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, stallions, strong horses (Luther), see on <a href="/jeremiah/8-16.htm">Jeremiah 8:16</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/47-3.htm">Jeremiah 47:3</a>. "Your mother" is the whole body of the people, the nation considered as a unity (cf. <a href="/isaiah/50-1.htm">Isaiah 50:1</a>; <a href="/hosea/2-4.htm">Hosea 2:4</a>; <a href="/hosea/4-5.htm">Hosea 4:5</a>), the individual members of which are called her sons; cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-7.htm">Jeremiah 5:7</a>, etc. In <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-12.htm">Jeremiah 50:12</a>, the disgrace that is to fall on Babylon is more distinctly specified. The thought is gathered up into a sententious saying, in imitation of the sayings of Balaam. "The last of the nations" is the antithesis of "the first of the nations," as Balaam calls Amalek, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/24-20.htm">Numbers 24:20</a>, because they were the first heathen nation that began to fight against the people of Israel. In like manner, Jeremiah calls Babylon the last of the heathen nations. As the end of Amalek is ruin (<a href="/numbers/24-20.htm">Numbers 24:20</a>), so the end of the last heathen nation that comes forward against Israel will be a wilderness, desert, steppe. The predicates (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/2-6.htm">Jeremiah 2:6</a>) refer to the country and kingdom of Babylon. But if the end of the kingdom is a desert, then the people must have perished. The devastation of Babylon is further portrayed in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-13.htm">Jeremiah 50:13</a>, together with a statement of the cause: "Because of the anger of Jahveh it shall not be inhabited;" cf. <a href="/isaiah/13-20.htm">Isaiah 13:20</a>. The words from &#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1514;&#1492; onwards are imitated from <a href="/jeremiah/49-17.htm">Jeremiah 49:17</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/19-8.htm">Jeremiah 19:8</a>.</body></html>
