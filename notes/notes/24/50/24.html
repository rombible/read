Cyrus turned aside the waters of the Euphrates into another channel, and entered by the river-bed, so that the city was taken before those who lived in the middle of the city knew that it was attacked (Herod. i. 191). In the latter case the gates were opened to Darius by the treachery of the Babylonian general Zopyrus (Herod. iii. 158).

Retorting to the stratagem that Cyrus used, in draining the river Euphrates, and marching his army up through it into the midst of the city of Babylon, and took it by surprise, while the inhabitants at night were feasting and revelling: this is said to be a snare laid by the Lord, because it was according to the counsel of his will, and through his directing and overruling providence: <p>and thou wast not aware; of what the enemy had done, of his march into the city, and taking of it; for, as Herodotus and Aristotle report, one part of the city was seized and taken before the other knew anything of it: <p>thou art found, and also caught; as wild beasts in a net, or birds in a snare. The Targum is, <p>"thy sins are sought, and are found, and also thou art taken:'' <p>because thou hast striven against the Lord; as persons litigate a point with each other in courts of judicature, or as warriors strive against each other in battle; she sinned against the Lord, and offended him, not only by her idolatry and luxury, but by her oppression of his people, and profaning the vessels of his house; as Belshazzar did, the night Babylon was taken.

But the cylinder inscription, translated by Sir H. Rawlinson in 1880, shows that Babylon opened its gates of its own accord, on hearing the defeat and capture of Nabonidus. There is no occasion to look for any further fulfilment of the prophecy than the surprise which must ever come upon the bystander when he sees a mighty empire suddenly pass into the hands of its enemies. The tenses in this verse are not very happily rendered. It would be better to translate, <span class="accented">I</span> <span class="accented">laid a snare for thee, and thou wast taken, O Babylon, unawares</span>; <span class="accented">thou wast found, etc., because thou hadst striven against the Lord.</span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/50.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Assyrian has already received his punishment for that-the Assyrian kingdom has been destroyed; Babylon will meet with the same punishment, and then (<a href="/jeremiah/50-19.htm">Jeremiah 50:19</a>) Israel will be led back to his pasture-ground. &#1504;&#1493;&#1492;, pasture-ground, grass-plot, where sheep feed, is the land of Israel. Israel, led back thither, will feed on Carmel and Bashan, the most fertile tracts of the country, and the mountains of Ephraim and Gilead, which also furnish fodder in abundance for sheep. As to Gilead, see <a href="/numbers/32-1.htm">Numbers 32:1</a>; <a href="/micah/7-14.htm">Micah 7:14</a>; and in regard to the mountains of Ephraim, <a href="/exodus/34-13.htm">Exodus 34:13</a>., where the feeding on the mountains of Israel and in the valleys is depicted as fat pasture. The mountains of Israel here signify the northern portion of the land generally, including the large and fertile plain of Jezreel, and the different valleys between the several ranges of mountains, which here and there show traces of luxuriant vegetation even yet; cf. Robinson's Physical Geography, p. 120. Then also the guilt of the sins of Israel and Judah shall be blotted out, because the Lord grants pardon to the remnant of His people. This promise points to the time of the New Covenant; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/31-34.htm">Jeremiah 31:34</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/33-8.htm">Jeremiah 33:8</a>. The deliverance of Israel from Babylon coincides with the view given of the regeneration of the people by the Messiah, just as we find throughout the second portion of Isaiah.
