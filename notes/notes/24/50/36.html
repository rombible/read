This may be applied to believers, who complain of the dominion of sin and corruption, and of their own weakness and manifold infirmities. Their Redeemer is able to keep what they commit to him; and sin shall not have dominion over them. He will give them that rest which remains for the people of God. Also here is Babylon's sin, and their punishment. The sins are, idolatry and persecution. He that will not save his people in their sins, never will countenance the wickedness of his open enemies. The judgments of God for these sins will lay them waste. In the judgments denounced against prosperous Babylon, and the mercies promised to afflicted Israel, we learn to choose to suffer affliction with the people of God, rather than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/50.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Liars - Soothsayers, fortune-tellers. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/50.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>36. liars&#8212;Those whom he before termed "wise men," he here calls "liars" (impostors), namely, the astrologers (compare Isa 44:25; Ro 1:21-25; 1Co 1:20).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/50.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">A sword is upon the liars; and they shall dote:</span> the word here translated <span class="ital">liars</span> is by some translated <span class="ital">bars</span>, by some <span class="ital">liars</span>; and in the Hebrew it hath both significations; which makes some think it is to be understood of the chief men, who are the props, stays, and bars of a place, whose wisdom God threatens should fail them, so as they should dote, and show themselves fools.

The Targum renders it "diviners"; and so Jarchi and Kimchi interpret it (n); of which there were many among the Chaldeans, who were a lying set of men, who imposed upon and deceived the people; these with their divinations and soothsayings could not save the land, nor themselves, from the devouring sword; nay, their sorceries and divinations were the cause of the ruin of it; see <a href="/isaiah/47-9.htm">Isaiah 47:9</a>; <p>and they shall dote; or, that they may "become foolish" (o); be infatuated, and act a mad part, and be at their wits' end; not knowing what course to take for their own safety, and much less be able to give direction and advice to others: <p>a sword is upon her mighty men, and they shall be dismayed; the soldiers and their officers, the most valiant and courageous of them; these would be in the utmost fright and consternation at the approach of the enemy; especially when they perceived the city taken, and the carnage made of the king and his nobles. <p>(m) "vectes"; so some in Gataker.

The Lord will now visit the presumption of Babylon. The day of punishment has arrived. On "behold, I am against thee," cf. <a href="/jeremiah/21-13.htm">Jeremiah 21:13</a>. "O arrogance, pride!" is directly addressed to Babylon: in <a href="/jeremiah/50-32.htm">Jeremiah 50:32</a> also there is a like designation of Babylon as the personification of pride.

"And I will kindle a fire," etc., stands as in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-14.htm">Jeremiah 21:14</a>, where, however, "in its forest" is found instead of "in his cities." The former, indeed, is the reading rendered by the lxx in this passage; but they have acted quite arbitrarily in this, since Jeremiah, for the most part, varies individual words when he repeats a thought. "In his cities" does not suit very well, inasmuch as the other cities of the country belonged to Babylon, the &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; as hers, and in <a href="/jeremiah/51-43.htm">Jeremiah 51:43</a> they are spoken of as hers; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/19-15.htm">Jeremiah 19:15</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/34-1.htm">Jeremiah 34:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-13.htm">Jeremiah 49:13</a>, etc.</body></html>
