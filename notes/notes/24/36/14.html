It is probably indicated by the first and last names on the list. Cushi ( = Ethiopian)—the name appears, probably with this sense, as that of a courier of Joab’s in <a href="/2_samuel/18-21.htm" title="Then said Joab to Cushi, Go tell the king what you have seen. And Cushi bowed himself to Joab, and ran.">2Samuel 18:21</a>—was an alien by birth, who, like Ebed-melech the Ethiopian (<a href="/jeremiah/38-7.htm" title="Now when Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, one of the eunuchs which was in the king's house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon; the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin;">Jeremiah 38:7</a>), had gained the favour of one of Jehoiakim’s predecessors, and had become a proselyte. The rule of <a href="/deuteronomy/23-8.htm" title="The children that are begotten of them shall enter into the congregation of the LORD in their third generation.">Deuteronomy 23:8</a> did not admit of the full incorporation of the descendants of such proselytes—Edomite or Egyptian, the latter term being taken probably as including Ethiopian—till the third generation, and the name Jehudi ( = Jew) was naturally enough given to the child who first became entitled to that privilege. The part he takes in the proceedings, though not more than ministerial, indicates sympathy with the prophet, and we may perhaps connect this with the like sympathy shown by Ebed-melech in <a href="/jeremiah/38-7.htm" title="Now when Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, one of the eunuchs which was in the king's house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon; the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin;">Jeremiah 38:7</a>. In <a href="/psalms/87-4.htm" title="I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon to them that know me: behold Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia; this man was born there.">Psalm 87:4</a> (probably belonging to the reign of Hezekiah) we have, it may be noted, a record of the admission of such Ethiopian proselytes. The purpose of his mission was to bring Baruch to the council of princes, that they might judge, on hearing the contents of the roll, how far it corresponded with Michaiah’s report. He comes, the princes listen, and the impression made on them is given in <a href="/jeremiah/36-16.htm" title="Now it came to pass, when they had heard all the words, they were afraid both one and other, and said to Baruch, We will surely tell the king of all these words.">Jeremiah 36:16</a>. We note a tone of respect in the request that Baruch would “sit down”—<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>take the attitude of a teacher (<a href="/luke/4-20.htm" title="And he closed the book, and he gave it again to the minister, and sat down.

The princes patiently attended the reading of the whole book. They were in great fear. But even those who are convinced to the truth and importance of what they hear, and are disposed to favour those who preach it, often have difficulties and reserves about their safety, interest, or preferment, so that they do not act according to their convictions, and try to get rid of what they find troublesome.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/36.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Jehudi signifies a Jew and Cushi an Ethiopian, but it seems reasonable to conclude that they are genuine, proper names. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/36.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14.
