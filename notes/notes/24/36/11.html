It seems obvious from Michaiah’s relation to him that his purpose in reporting Baruch’s discourse was not unfriendly. Probably it was part of a preconcerted plan, arranged between the prophet and his friends, that he should report it, and so give an opening for bringing Baruch into the presence of the king and his counsellors, as they sat in what we may call their council-chamber.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/36.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/jeremiah/36-11.htm" title="When Michaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard out of the book all the words of the LORD,...">Jeremiah 36:11-15</a></span>. <span class="ital">When Michaiah, the son of Shaphan, had heard, </span>&c. — Shaphan’s family were all great men at court: see note on <a href="/jeremiah/26-24.htm" title="Nevertheless the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death.">Jeremiah 26:24</a>; <span class="ital">he went down into the king’s house, </span>&c. — It is uncertain whether this Michaiah went to make this relation to the princes, who sat in the secretary’s chamber, as a piece of news only, or out of a malicious design to accuse the prophet and Baruch, as persons guilty of a seditious practice, in what they had done. <span class="ital">Then Michaiah declared unto them all the words that he had heard </span>— That is, the substance of all the words, &c.; for none can imagine that a hearer could remember every word. <span class="ital">Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi, </span>&c. — That is, all the princes who at that time sat there in council sent a messenger with a command to Baruch to appear before them, and to bring the roll which he had read in the ears of the people. <span class="ital">And they said, Sit down now and read it.

The princes patiently attended the reading of the whole book. They were in great fear.

Baruch, who is mentioned so early as <a href="/jeremiah/32-12.htm">Jeremiah 32:12</a>. as the attendant of the prophet, was, according to the passage now before us, his amanuensis, and executed his commissions. &#1488;&#1504;&#1497; &#1506;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, according to <a href="/jeremiah/33-1.htm">Jeremiah 33:1</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-15.htm">Jeremiah 39:15</a>, might mean, "I am in prison;" but this does not accord with the request of the princes, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-19.htm">Jeremiah 36:19</a>, that Jeremiah should hide himself. Moreover, &#1506;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; does not mean "seized, captus," but "stopped, restrained, hindered;" see on <a href="/nehemiah/6-10.htm">Nehemiah 6:10</a>. The cause of hindrance is not mentioned, as being away from the purpose of the narrative. "To read in the roll in the ears of the people," i.e., to read to the people out of the book. &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493;&#1501; &#1510;&#1493;&#1501; does not mean "on any fast-day whatever," but, "on the fast-day." The article is omitted because there was no need for defining the fast-day more exactly. The special fast-day mentioned in <a href="/jeremiah/36-9.htm">Jeremiah 36:9</a> is intended. '&#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500; &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1504;&#1468;&#1514;&#1501; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;, "their supplication will fall down before the Lord," i.e., reach unto God, as if it were laid before His feet. &#1504;&#1508;&#1500; is transferred from the posture of the suppliant - his falling down before God - to his supplication. Hence, in Hiphil, to make the supplication fall down before the Lord is equivalent to laying the request at His feet; <a href="/jeremiah/38-26.htm">Jeremiah 38:26</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/42-9.htm">Jeremiah 42:9</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/9-18.htm">Daniel 9:18</a>, <a href="/daniel/9-20.htm">Daniel 9:20</a>. If the supplication actually comes before God, it is also heard and finds success. This success is pointed out in '&#1493;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;, "that they may repent." If man, in a repentant spirit, supplicates God for grace, God grants him power for conversion. But the return of the people from their wicked way is indispensable, because the wrath which God has expressed concerning it is great, i.e., because God has threatened a heavy judgment of wrath. </body></html>
