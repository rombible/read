Already mentioned as Jeremiah's attendant, in <a href="/jeremiah/32-12.htm">Jeremiah 32:12</a>. He appears to have been of high rank (see on ver. 15), as Josephus, indeed, expressly states ('Ant.,' 10:09, 1). Maaseiah, his grandfather, was governor of the city (<a href="/2_chronicles/34-8.htm">2 Chronicles 34:8</a>), and Seraiah his brother (<a href="/jeremiah/51-59.htm">Jeremiah 51:59</a>) held some equally honourable, though not so easily definable, position in the court. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/35.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The example of the Rechabites is one for Judah. - Jeremiah is to proclaim the word of the Lord to the people of Judah, as follows: <a href="/jeremiah/35-13.htm">Jeremiah 35:13</a>. "Thus saith Jahveh of hosts, the God of Israel: Go and say to the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Will ye not receive instruction by listening to my words? saith Jahveh. <a href="/jeremiah/35-14.htm">Jeremiah 35:14</a>. The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, who commanded this sons not to drink wine, are performed, and they have drunk no wine to this day, but have obeyed the command of their father. But I have spoken unto you, rising up early and speaking, yet ye have not listened unto me. <a href="/jeremiah/35-15.htm">Jeremiah 35:15</a>. And I sent unto you all my servants the prophets, rising early and sending them, saying, Turn ye, now, every one from his evil way, and do good deeds, and do not go after other gods, to serve them; then shall ye dwell in the land which I have given to you and to your fathers. But ye did not incline your ear, nor hearken unto me. <a href="/jeremiah/35-16.htm">Jeremiah 35:16</a>. Yea, the children of Jonadab the son of Rechab have observed the commandment of their father which he commanded them, while this people have not hearkened unto me. <a href="/jeremiah/35-17.htm">Jeremiah 35:17</a>. Therefore, thus saith Jahveh, the God of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will bring upon Judah and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil which I have uttered regarding them, because I spake unto them and they did not hear, and I called unto them, but they did not answer. <a href="/jeremiah/35-18.htm">Jeremiah 35:18</a>. And to the house of the Rechabites Jeremiah said: Thus saith Jahveh of hosts, the God of Israel, Because ye have listened to the command of Jonadab your father, and have kept all his commandments, and have done according to all that he commanded you, <a href="/jeremiah/35-19.htm">Jeremiah 35:19</a>. Therefore, thus saith Jahveh of hosts, the God of Israel, Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not want a man to stand before me for ever."<p>The command, "Go and speak to the men of Judah," etc., shows that it was not in the chamber of the temple, in presence of the Rechabites, but probably in one of the temple fore-courts, that Jeremiah addressed the following word of the Lord to the people assembled there. In order to shame the Jews thoroughly, he shows them the faithfulness with which the Rechabites observe the ordinances of their ancestor Jonadab. The character of the address, as one intended to rouse feelings of shame, is indicated even at the beginning of <a href="/jeremiah/35-13.htm">Jeremiah 35:13</a> : "Will ye not receive instruction by hearkening to the words of the Lord?" The Hoph. &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511;&#1501; is construed as a passive with the accus.; in the older writers we frequently find this construction, in which the passive is used impersonally, hence the sing. is here employed: cf. Ges. 143, 1, Ew. 295, b. "To this day" - now for nearly 300 years without interruption; for Jonadab was already held in high esteem when Jehu ascended the throne, 883 b.c. (<a href="/2_kings/10-15.htm">2 Kings 10:15</a>). Judah, on the contrary, does not listen to the commandments which his God unceasingly inculcates on him, but rather wanders after other gods, to serve them. On <a href="/jeremiah/35-15.htm">Jeremiah 35:15</a> cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-4.htm">Jeremiah 25:4-5</a>. &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1488;&#1491;&#1502;&#1492; stands for &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1488;&#1491;&#1502;&#1492; , <a href="/jeremiah/25-5.htm">Jeremiah 25:5</a>. - In <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-16.htm">Jeremiah 35:16</a>, where the introductory &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, imo, indicates a culmination, the idea is once more briefly expressed. Ngelsbach incorrectly renders &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; "because," and makes <a href="/jeremiah/35-16.htm">Jeremiah 35:16</a> the protasis to <a href="/jeremiah/35-17.htm">Jeremiah 35:17</a>. "Such a protasis with because (quia), without any connection with what precedes, is contrary to the use of language" (Hitzig).
