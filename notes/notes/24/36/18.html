The princes patiently attended the reading of the whole book. They were in great fear. But even those who are convinced to the truth and importance of what they hear, and are disposed to favour those who preach it, often have difficulties and reserves about their safety, interest, or preferment, so that they do not act according to their convictions, and try to get rid of what they find troublesome.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/36.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He pronounced - He used to say aloud, he dictated.

They must needs conceive that the thing was done from God, for without a special influence of God it had been a thing impossible that Jeremiah should have called to mind all that he had spoken at several times in so many years; and proceeding from the God of truth, they must needs fear that they would have their certain and just accomplishment in their season. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/36.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then Baruch answered them,.... At once, without any hesitation, plainly and fully: <p>he pronounced all these words unto me with his mouth; that is, the Prophet Jeremiah delivered by word of mouth, not the substance only of this roll, but the express words of it, and everyone of them, and that clearly and distinctly, without any hesitation, or premeditation; by which it is plain it was by the Spirit of the Lord he did it; neither matter nor words were Baruch's, but were exactly as they were delivered: <p>and I wrote them with ink in the book; as they saw with their eyes, and which was the manner of writing with the Jews so early; Baruch had no further concern in this matter than to provide pen, ink, and parchment, and to make use of them as he did, just as the prophet dictated and directed him. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/36.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then Baruch answered them, He pronounced all these words unto me with his mouth, and I wrote them with ink in the book.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/36.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He pronounced,</span> etc.; rather, <span class="accented">He kept dictating</span>...  <span class="accented">while I wrote with ink</span>, etc. The addition of the last clause suggests (and was, perhaps, intended to do so) that Baruch's function was simply mechanical. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/36.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Micaiah, a son of Gemariah, was also listening to the reading; and he it was who brought the news into the palace.
