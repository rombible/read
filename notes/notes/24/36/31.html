So hardened was the king, that he and his servants neither were terrified by the threatenings of the prophet, nor felt deep sorrow, as Josiah did in a similar case (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/22-11.htm">2 Kings 22:11</a>, cf. <a href="/1_kings/21-27.htm">1 Kings 21:27</a>), nor did they listen to the earnest representations of the princes. &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1497;&#1493; are the court-attendants of the king in contrast with the princes, who, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-16.htm">Jeremiah 36:16</a>, had been alarmed by what they heard read, and wished, by entreaties, to keep the king from the commission of such a wicked act as the destruction of the book.
