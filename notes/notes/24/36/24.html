The king and his "servants" were more hardened than the "princes" and councillors (see on [947]Jer 36:12; [948]Jer 36:14; [949]Jer 36:16). Contrast the humble fear exhibited by Josiah at the reading of the law (2Ki 22:11).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/36.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> So hardened were this people’s hearts, that though they knew that Jeremiah was a prophet of the Lord, upon the experience now of more than twenty years, and the whole scope of his prophecies had been to denounce the just judgments of God that now were coming upon this people, and they could not but understand that God must be greatly assistant to Jeremiah in writing this <span class="ital">roll</span>, all the matter of which he could not otherwise have kept in mind so many years, yet they had no serious fear of God upon their hearts, working upon the hearing the dreadful matter of these prophecies, nor showed any sign of remorse, or sense of their sins, or God’s judgments coming upon them as indications of his wrath. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/36.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Yet they were not afraid, nor rent their garments,.... They were not struck with horror at such an impious action as the burning of the roll; nor afraid of the judgments and wrath of God threatened in it; nor did they rend their garments in token of sorrow and mourning on account of either, as used to be when anything blasphemous was said or done, or any bad news were brought. The Jews from hence conclude, that whenever a man sees the book of the law torn of cut to pieces, he should rend his garments (t). The persons here meant are not the princes that first heard the roll read in the secretary's office, for they were afraid, <a href="/jeremiah/36-16.htm">Jeremiah 36:16</a>; unless they now dissembled in the king's presence, or had shook off their fears; however, if they are included, three must be excepted, whose names are mentioned in <a href="/jeremiah/36-25.htm">Jeremiah 36:25</a>; and those who are more especially designed are expressed in the next clause: <p>neither the king, nor any of his servants that heard all these words; not all that were in the roll, for they only heard a part; but all that were in that part, which was enough to make them fear and tremble; but they were hardened in their sins; and by the hardness and impenitence of their hearts treasured up wrath against the day of wrath. These servants of the king seem to be those in waiting, and not the princes that came to him; however, they were not all of this complexion and character, since it follows: <p>(t) T. Bab.

Thereupon Baruch replied, "He used to call aloud these words to me," i.e., he used to dictate them to me by word of mouth, "and I wrote them in the book with ink." The imperfect expresses the repeated or continued doing of anything; hence &#1497;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488; here means to dictate, which requires considerable time. In the following circumstantial clause is found the participle &#1493;&#1488;&#1504;&#1497; &#1499;&#1514;&#1489;, while I was writing; and so I myself was doing nothing else all the time than writing down what was dictated. Some commentators have found a stumbling-block in &#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493; in the question of the princes (<a href="/jeremiah/36-17.htm">Jeremiah 36:17</a>); the lxx and Ewald omit this word, inasmuch as Baruch does not explain till afterwards that he had written down the words from the mouth of Jeremiah. Others, like Venema, take &#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493; as a question  equals  &#1492;&#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493;. Both explanations are arbitrary and unnecessary. The princes knew quite well that the substance of the book was from the mouth of Jeremiah, i.e., contained his addresses; but Baruch, too, might have composed the book from the oral discourses of the prophet without being commissioned by him, without his knowledge also, and against his will. Accordingly, to attain certainty as to the share of the prophet in this matter, they ask him, and Baruch answers that Jeremiah had dictated it to him.</body></html>
