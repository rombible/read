After the burning of the roll by the king, Jeremiah received from the Lord the command to get all that had been on the former roll written on another, and to announce the following to Jehoiakim the king: <a href="/jeremiah/36-29.htm">Jeremiah 36:29</a>. "Thus saith Jahveh: Thou hast burned this roll, whilst thou sayest, Why hast thou written thereon, The king of Babylon shall surely come and destroy this land, and root out man and beast from it? <a href="/jeremiah/36-30.htm">Jeremiah 36:30</a>. Therefore thus saith Jahveh regarding Jehoiakim the king of Judah: He shall not have one who sits upon the throne of David, and his corpse shall be cast forth to the heat by day and to the frost by night. <a href="/jeremiah/36-31.htm">Jeremiah 36:31</a>. And I shall punish him, his servants, and his seed for their iniquity, and bring on them and on all the inhabitants of Judah and all the men of Judah all the evil which I have spoken to them; but they did not hear." On the meaning of <a href="/jeremiah/36-29.htm">Jeremiah 36:29</a> see p. 316, supra. The threatening expressed in <a href="/jeremiah/36-30.htm">Jeremiah 36:30</a>. is really only a repetition of what is given in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-18.htm">Jeremiah 22:18-19</a>, and has already been explained there. "There shall not be to him one who sits upon the throne of David," i.e., he is not to have a son that shall occupy the throne of David after him. This does not contradict the fact that, after his death, his son Jehoiachin ascended the throne. For this ascension could not be called a sitting on the throne, a reign, inasmuch as he was immediately besieged in Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar, and compelled to surrender after three months, then go into exile to Babylon. On <a href="/jeremiah/36-31.htm">Jeremiah 36:31</a> cf. <a href="/jeremiah/35-17.htm">Jeremiah 35:17</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/19-15.htm">Jeremiah 19:15</a>.<p><a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-22.htm">Jeremiah 36:22-32</a><p>Thereupon Jeremiah made his attendant Baruch write all the words of the former roll on a new one, "out of his mouth," i.e., at his dictation; and to these he added many other words like them. &#1499;&#1468;&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;, i.e., of like import with those on the previous roll. Hence we perceive that on the first roll there were written down not all the several addresses fully, but only the most important parts of his oral announcements. </body></html>
