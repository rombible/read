Some think it was on account of the dearth, drought, and famine in the land, <a href="/jeremiah/14-1.htm">Jeremiah 14:1</a>; and others, which seems most likely, take it to be on account of the calamity threatened the nation by the Chaldean army.

This latter statement seems to tally with the notices in <a href="/2_kings/24.htm">2 Kings 24</a>. The vassalage of Jehoiakim is there said to have lasted three years; this followed the rebellion; while the siege of Jerusalem was reserved for the short reign of Jehoiachin. Now, as this siege must have been the punishment of Jehoiakim's rebellion, and as the reign of the latter king lasted eleven years, we are brought to the same date as that given by Josephus for the commencement of the vassalage, viz. the eighth year. It is to this year, then, that <a href="/2_kings/24-1.htm">2 Kings 24:1</a> refers when it says, "In his days Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon came up, and Jehoiakim became his servant;" and also the narrative before us in the statement that "they proclaimed a fast before Jehovah to all the people in Jerusalem, and to all the people that came from the cities of Judah unto Jerusalem." What other event would have produced such a concourse of worshippers? The battle of Carchemish (which took place in the fourth year of Jehoiakim)? But it was by no means clear as yet that the consequences of this would be disastrous for Judah. Carchemish was too far off for the people of Judah to show such serious alarm (similarly Gratz, 'Monatsschrift,' etc., vol. 23. p. 300). If so, Jeremiah kept his prophecy by him for several years, till the fight moment came. <span class="cmt_word">The ninth month.</span> As this is a winter month (see ver. 22), Jeremiah evidently reckons by the Babylonian calendar, the ninth month of which, Kisiluv (Hebrew, Chisleu), began from the new moon of December. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/36.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The word of the Lord to Jeremiah was to this effect: "Take thee a book-roll, and write on it (&#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492; for &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;) all the words that I have spoken unto thee concerning Israel and Judah, and concerning all the nations, from the day I spake unto thee, from the days of Josiah till this day. <a href="/jeremiah/36-3.htm">Jeremiah 36:3</a>. Perhaps the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I meditate doing to them, that they may return every one from his evil way, and that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin." &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468; here means, to hear correctly and lay to heart; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/26-3.htm">Jeremiah 26:3</a>. Hitzig views the command as meaning, not that Jeremiah is now for the first time to write down his addresses (which would be an impossibility for the most faithful memory), but that he is merely to write them down together in one book, out of the several scattered leaves and scraps. Graf has already refuted this view, though more fully than was necessary. It is not a copying, word for word, of every separate address that is meant, but merely a writing down of the essential contents of all his oral discourses. This is quite clear, not merely from what is stated in <a href="/jeremiah/36-3.htm">Jeremiah 36:3</a> as the object of this command, but also from the character of these collected addresses, as they are preserved to us. That the expression "all the words" is not to be understood in the most rigid sense, follows from the very fact that, when Jeremiah anew wrote down his prophecies, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-32.htm">Jeremiah 36:32</a>, he further added "many similar words" to what had been contained in the first book-roll, which was burned by Jehoiakim. But Jeremiah might perhaps be able to retain in his memory the substance of all the addresses he had delivered during the twenty-three years, since all of them treated of the same subjects - reproof of prevailing sins, threat of punishment, and promises. </body></html>
