The princes patiently attended the reading of the whole book. They were in great fear. But even those who are convinced to the truth and importance of what they hear, and are disposed to favour those who preach it, often have difficulties and reserves about their safety, interest, or preferment, so that they do not act according to their convictions, and try to get rid of what they find troublesome.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/36.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Jehudi signifies a Jew and Cushi an Ethiopian, but it seems reasonable to conclude that they are genuine, proper names. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/36.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14.

In the fifth year of Jehoiakim, in the ninth month, "they proclaimed a fast before the Lord - all the people in Jerusalem, and all the people who had come out of the cities of the Judah to Jerusalem." &#1511;&#1514;&#1488; &#1510;&#1493;&#1501;, to call, declare, appoint a fast; cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/21-9.htm">1 Kings 21:9</a>, <a href="/1_kings/21-12.htm">1 Kings 21:12</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/20-3.htm">2 Chronicles 20:3</a>. From the tenor of the words, the people who lived in Jerusalem and those who had come thither out of the country might seem to have called the fast. But this is impossible; for the people from the cities of Judah evidently came to Jerusalem only in consequence of the fast being appointed. Hence Graf is of opinion that &#1511;&#1514;&#1488; &#1510;&#1493;&#1501; seems here used in a general way of the keeping of such a fast. This view is not confirmed by any parallel instances. The expression is inexact, and the inexactness has arisen from the effort to attain greater conciseness of expression. The meaning is this: a fast was proclaimed, and all the people in Jerusalem and out of the cities of Judah came to worship the Lord in the temple. It remains doubtful with whom the appointment originated, - whether with the king, or with the high priest and the priesthood. The ninth month corresponds to our December, and consequently came round with the cold season; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/36-22.htm">Jeremiah 36:22</a>. The fast-day was a special one; for in the law only the day of atonement, in the seventh month, was prescribed as a fast-day. On the object of this measure, see supra, p. 316f.</body></html>
