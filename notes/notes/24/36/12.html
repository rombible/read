Delaiah (the name signifies “the Lord delivers,” and is found as that of a priest in the time of David, <a href="/1_chronicles/24-18.htm" title="The three and twentieth to Delaiah, the four and twentieth to Maaziah.">1Chronicles 24:18</a>) joins Elnathan and Gemariah in pleading against the king’s destruction of the prophetic roll.

The royal palace, which was not upon the mountain on which the temple stood, but lay lower, and therefore Micaiah is said to go down to it; with what design he went thither is not certain, whether out of ill will to Jeremiah and Baruch, or out of good will, being affected with what he had heard, and desirous that some steps might be taken by the government to prevent the calamities coming upon them, according to these prophecies; which latter seems most probable, since no charge or accusation is brought by him; and since his father, with others, to whom he gave the account afterwards, interceded with the king that the roll might not be burnt, <a href="/jeremiah/36-25.htm">Jeremiah 36:25</a>; however, immediately after he had heard the roll read, he went to the king's house: <p>into the scribe's chamber; the secretary's office; formerly his grandfather Shaphan's, now Elishama's: <p>and, lo, all the princes sat there; some of them are mentioned by name: <p>even Elishama the scribe; or secretary; the prime minister, the principal secretary of state, and therefore named first, in whose chamber or office they were: <p>and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah; who this person was, or his office, is not known; he is nowhere else made mention of; and who his father was is not certain: <p>and Elnathan the son of Achbor; the same that Jehoiakim sent to Egypt to fetch Uriah from thence, <a href="/jeremiah/26-22.htm">Jeremiah 26:22</a>; <p>and Gemariah the son of Shaphan: who was Micaiah's father, and in whose chamber Baruch read the roll: <p>and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah; of this prince also no account is given elsewhere: <p>and all the princes; the rest of them, who were either members of the great sanhedrim, or courtiers; it appears from hence that this court was very profane and irreligious; for though they had proclaimed a fast, to make a show of religion, or at the importunity of the people; yet they did not attend temple worship and service themselves, but were all together in the secretary's office, very probably about political affairs. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/36.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then he went down into the king's house, into the scribe's chamber: and, lo, all the princes sat there, even Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan the son of Achbor, and Gemariah the son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the princes.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/36.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">12</span>. <span class="ital">he went down</span>] See on <a href="/jeremiah/22-1.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; Go down to the house of the king of Judah, and speak there this word,">Jeremiah 22:1</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Elnathan the son of Achbor</span>] mentioned ch. <a href="/jeremiah/26-22.htm" title="And Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt, namely, Elnathan the son of Achbor, and certain men with him into Egypt.">Jeremiah 26:22</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/36.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He went down</span> (see on Jeremiah 26:10). <span class="cmt_word">Sat there.</span> In deliberation on the affairs of the state. <span class="cmt_word">Elishama the scribe</span>.

Baruch, who is mentioned so early as <a href="/jeremiah/32-12.htm">Jeremiah 32:12</a>. as the attendant of the prophet, was, according to the passage now before us, his amanuensis, and executed his commissions. &#1488;&#1504;&#1497; &#1506;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, according to <a href="/jeremiah/33-1.htm">Jeremiah 33:1</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-15.htm">Jeremiah 39:15</a>, might mean, "I am in prison;" but this does not accord with the request of the princes, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-19.htm">Jeremiah 36:19</a>, that Jeremiah should hide himself. Moreover, &#1506;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; does not mean "seized, captus," but "stopped, restrained, hindered;" see on <a href="/nehemiah/6-10.htm">Nehemiah 6:10</a>. The cause of hindrance is not mentioned, as being away from the purpose of the narrative. "To read in the roll in the ears of the people," i.e., to read to the people out of the book. &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493;&#1501; &#1510;&#1493;&#1501; does not mean "on any fast-day whatever," but, "on the fast-day." The article is omitted because there was no need for defining the fast-day more exactly. The special fast-day mentioned in <a href="/jeremiah/36-9.htm">Jeremiah 36:9</a> is intended. '&#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500; &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1504;&#1468;&#1514;&#1501; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;, "their supplication will fall down before the Lord," i.e., reach unto God, as if it were laid before His feet. &#1504;&#1508;&#1500; is transferred from the posture of the suppliant - his falling down before God - to his supplication. Hence, in Hiphil, to make the supplication fall down before the Lord is equivalent to laying the request at His feet; <a href="/jeremiah/38-26.htm">Jeremiah 38:26</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/42-9.htm">Jeremiah 42:9</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/9-18.htm">Daniel 9:18</a>, <a href="/daniel/9-20.htm">Daniel 9:20</a>. If the supplication actually comes before God, it is also heard and finds success. This success is pointed out in '&#1493;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;, "that they may repent." If man, in a repentant spirit, supplicates God for grace, God grants him power for conversion. But the return of the people from their wicked way is indispensable, because the wrath which God has expressed concerning it is great, i.e., because God has threatened a heavy judgment of wrath. </body></html>
