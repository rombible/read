The land of Egypt, compared to a forest, for the multitude of its cities and towns, and the inhabitants of them; which should be destroyed by the Chaldeans, as a forest is cut down by hewers of wood; the metaphor is here continued. The Targum interprets this of the princes of Egypt, and the destruction of them; <p>though it cannot be searched; either the forest of Egypt, which was so thick of trees; that is, the land was so full of towns and cities, that they could not be searched and numbered; and though the way through it seemed impassable, yet was made passable by the hewers of wood: or its destruction would be so general, "that it cannot be searched" (o); or found out, where this forest was, where those trees grew, not one of them standing: or else this is to be understood of the Chaldean army, which was so great, that it could not be numbered: <p>because they are more than the grasshoppers, and are innumerable; which creatures come in large numbers, and eat up every green tree and herb; and so the Chaldean army, being alike numerous, would easily cut down the trees of this forest, though they were so many. <p>(o)   "ut non investigetur", Calvin. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/46.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">They shall cut down <span class="cverse3">{u}</span> her forest, saith the LORD, though it cannot be searched; because they are more than the<p>(x) grasshoppers, and <i>are</i> innumerable.</span><p>(u) That is, they will slay the great and mighty men of power.<p>(x) That is, Nebuchadnezzar's army.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/46.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">23</span>. <span class="ital">though</span>] better, as mg. <span class="ital">for</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">they are more</span>] i.e. the enemy.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the locusts</span>] See on <a href="/joel/1-4.htm" title="That which the palmerworm has left has the locust eaten; and that which the locust has left has the cankerworm eaten; and that which the cankerworm has left has the caterpillar eaten.">Joel 1:4</a>, C.B.

De Dieu's explanation is, "Because the forest is so dense, so intricate, it is necessary to clear a path by cutting down the trees." But this does not seem to suit the context. Surely no other reason was required for the destruction of the "forest" than the will of the wood cutters. "Searching out" occurs in Job (<a href="/job/5-9.htm">Job 5:9</a>; <a href="/job/9-10.htm">Job 9:10</a>; <a href="/job/36-26.htm">Job 36:26</a>; comp. also <a href="/1_kings/7-47.htm">1 Kings 7:47</a>) in connection with numbering, and the second half of the verse expressly describes the foe as innumerable.

"There they cry, 'Pharaoh the king of Egypt is &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1503;, desolation, destruction, ruin:' " for this meaning, cf. <a href="/jeremiah/25-31.htm">Jeremiah 25:31</a>; <a href="/psalms/40-3.htm">Psalm 40:3</a>; the signification "noise, bustle," is unsuitable here.<p>(Note: The word &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; has been read by the lxx and the Vulgate as if it had been &#1513;&#1473;&#1501;, &#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;, nomen; accordingly the lxx render, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; &#x3a6;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c9;&#768; &#x39d;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c9;&#768; &#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2; &#x391;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#x3c9;&#768;&#x3bd;  &#787;&#x395;&#x3c3;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#768;  &#787;&#x395;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3b4; (or  &#787;&#x395;&#x3c3;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x39c;&#x3c9;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3b4;e'd); Vulgate, vocate nomen Pharaonis regis Aegypti: Tumultum adduxit tempus. This reading is preferred by J. D. Michaelis, Ewald, Hitzig, and Graf, with this difference, that Hitzig and Graf take only &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1503; as a name. Hence Ewald translates, "They call Pharaoh's name 'Noise-which-a-wink-can-hush.' " This rendering is decidedly false, for &#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491; nowhere has the sense of "wink, nod," not even in <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/20-38.htm">Judges 20:38</a>, where it means an agreement made. For the reading &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; instead of &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; there are no sufficient grounds, although such passages as <a href="/jeremiah/20-3.htm">Jeremiah 20:3</a> and <a href="/isaiah/30-7.htm">Isaiah 30:7</a> may be adduced in support of the idea obtained by such a change in the word. The translation of the lxx is merely a reproduction of the Hebrew words by Greek letters, and shows that the translator did not know how to interpret them. The Vulgate rendering, tumultum adduxit tempus, is also devoid of meaning. Moreover, these translators have read &#1511;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; as the imperative &#1511;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;; if we reject this reading, as all moderns do, then we may also lay no weight on &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; instead of &#1513;&#1473;&#1501;. Besides, the meaning is not materially affected by this reading, for the giving of a name to a person merely expresses what he is or will be.)<p>The meaning of &#1492;&#1506;&#1489;&#1497;&#1512; &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491; also is disputed; it is quite inadmissible, however, to join the words with &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1503;, as Ewald does, for the purpose of making out a name. No suitable meaning can be extracted from them. Neither &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1503; nor &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491; can be the subject of &#1492;&#1506;&#1489;&#1497;&#1512;; the translation given by Schnurrer, "devastation that goes beyond all bounds," is still more arbitrary than that of Ewald given in the note. Since the Hiphil &#1492;&#1506;&#1489;&#1497;&#1512; is never used except with a transitive meaning, the subject can be none else than Pharaoh; and the words &#1492;&#1506;&#1489;&#1497;&#1512; &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491; must be intended to give the reason for this becoming a desolation: they are thus to be rendered, "he has allowed &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491; to pass by," not "the precise place," as Rosenmller explains it ("he did not stop in his flight at the place where the army could be gathered again, on the return"), but "the precise time." The reference, however, is not to the suitable time for action, for self-defence and for driving off the enemy (Grotius, C. B. Michaelis, Maurer, Umbreit), because the word does not mean suitable, convenient time, but appointed time. As Hitzig rightly perceived, the time meant is that within which the desolation might still be averted, and after which the judgment of God fell on him (<a href="/isaiah/10-25.htm">Isaiah 10:25</a>; <a href="/isaiah/30-18.htm">Isaiah 30:18</a>), - the time of grace which God had vouchsafed to him, so that Nebuchadnezzar did not at once, after the victory at Carchemish, invade and conquer Egypt. Pharaoh let this time pass by; because, instead of seeing in that defeat a judgment from God, he provoked the anger of Nebuchadnezzar by his repeated attacks on the Chaldean power, and brought on the invasion of Egypt by the king of Babylon (see above, p. 354). - In <a href="/jeremiah/46-18.htm">Jeremiah 46:18</a>. there is laid down a more positive foundation for the threat uttered in <a href="/jeremiah/46-17.htm">Jeremiah 46:17</a>. With an oath, the Lord announces the coming of the destroyer into Egypt. Like Tabor, which overtops all the mountains round about, and like Carmel, which looks out over the sea as if it were a watch-tower, so will he come, viz., he from whom proceeds the devastation of Egypt, the king of Babylon. the power of Nebuchadnezzar, in respect of its overshadowing all other kings, forms the point of comparison. Tabor has the form of a truncated cone. Its height is given at 1805 feet above the level of the sea, or 1350 from the surface of the plain below; it far surpasses in height all the hills in the vicinity, ad affords a wide prospect on every side; cf. Robinson's Phys. Geogr. of Palestine, p. 26f. Carmel stretches out in the form of a long ridge more than three miles wide, till it terminates on the shore of the Mediterranean Sea, as a bold, lofty promontory, which rises in an imposing manner at least 500 feet above the sea; cf. Robinson, p. 26f. Then the inhabitants of Egypt will be driven into exile. &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497; &#1490;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492; .e, "vessels of wandering;" outfit for an exile, as in <a href="/ezekiel/12-3.htm">Ezekiel 12:3</a>. "Daughter of Egypt" is not a personification of the country, whose inhabitants are the people, but of the population, which is viewed as the daughter of the country; it stands in apposition to &#1497;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1514;, like &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514; &#1489;&#1468;&#1514; &#1502;&#1510;&#1512;&#1497;, <a href="/jeremiah/46-11.htm">Jeremiah 46:11</a>. For Noph, i.e., Memphis, the capital, is laid waste and burned, so as to lose its inhabitants. With <a href="/jeremiah/46-20.htm">Jeremiah 46:20</a> begins the second strophe, in which the fate impending on Egypt is still more plainly predicted.</body></html>
