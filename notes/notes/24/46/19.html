The "daughter of Egypt" means the population of Egypt, the land being regarded as the mother of its people. <span class="cmt_word">Furnish thyself to go into captivity.</span> The rendering of the margin is, however, more exact. The "vessels of captivity [or, 'exile']" are a pilgrim's staff and wallet, with the provisions and utensils necessary for a journey (so in <a href="/ezekiel/12-4.htm">Ezekiel 12:4</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/46.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The second prophecy regarding Egypt, with a message for Israel attached to it, was uttered after the preceding. This is evident even from the superscription, <a href="/jeremiah/46-13.htm">Jeremiah 46:13</a> : "The word which Jahveh spake to Jeremiah the prophet of the coming of Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon to smite the land of Egypt." The formula, "The word which," etc., agrees with that in <a href="/jeremiah/50-1.htm">Jeremiah 50:1</a>; and &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;, in contrast with &#1492;&#1497;&#1492;, the word usually met with in headings, perhaps means that this prophecy, like that concerning Babylon, was not uttered in public by Jeremiah, but only written down. &#1500;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488; is used in reference to the coming of Nebuchadrezzar to smite the land. Graf puts down this heading as an addition, not made till a late edition of the prophecies was brought out, and even then added through a mistake on the part of the compiler. In support of this, he urges that the announcement in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-14.htm">Jeremiah 46:14-26</a> does not form an independent prophecy, but merely constitutes the second portion of the description given in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-3.htm">Jeremiah 46:3-12</a> of the defeat of the Egyptians. But the ground assigned for this view, viz., that if this prophecy formed a separate and distinct piece, written at another time, then Jeremiah would have predicted the conquest of the other countries, Philistia, Moab, Ammon, etc., in consequence of the battle of Carchemish; and as regards Egypt, would have contented himself with a triumphal song over its fall - which is in itself unlikely: this argument is utterly null. It has no meaning whatever; for <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-3.htm">Jeremiah 46:3-12</a> contain, not a triumphal song over a defeat that had already taken place, but a prophecy regarding the defeat about to take place. To this the prophet added a second prophecy, in which he once more announces beforehand to Egypt that it shall be conquered. In this way, more is foretold regarding Egypt than the neighbouring countries, because Egypt was of much greater consequence, in relation to the theocracy, than Philistia, Moab, etc. According to the superscription, this second prophecy refers to the conquest of Egypt by Nebuchadnezzar. According to <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-5.htm">Jeremiah 37:5</a>, this did not take place so long as Zedekiah was king; and according to <a href="/jeremiah/43-8.htm">Jeremiah 43:8</a>., it was foretold by Jeremiah, after the destruction of Jerusalem, when the Jews were fleeing to Egypt after the murder of Gedaliah. From this, one might conclude, with Ngelsbach, that the piece now before us is contemporaneous with <a href="/jeremiah/43-8.htm">Jeremiah 43:8</a>. But this inference is not a valid one. The threat uttered in <a href="/jeremiah/43-8.htm">Jeremiah 43:8</a>. of a conquest to befall Egypt had a special occasion of its own, and we cannot well regard it in any other light than as a repetition of the prophecy now before us, for the Jews; for its contents seem to show that it was composed not long after that in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-3.htm">Jeremiah 46:3-12</a>, or soon after the defeat of the Egyptians at Carchemish. This address also falls into two strophes, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-14.htm">Jeremiah 46:14-19</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-20.htm">Jeremiah 46:20-26</a>, while <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-27.htm">Jeremiah 46:27</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/46-28.htm">Jeremiah 46:28</a> form an additional message for Israel. The line of thought is this: Egypt may arm herself as she chooses, but her power shall fall, and her auxiliaries shall flee (<a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-14.htm">Jeremiah 46:14-16</a>). Pharaoh's fall is certain; the enemy shall come in force, and turn all Egypt into a desert (<a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-17.htm">Jeremiah 46:17-19</a>). The destroyer comes from the north, the mercenaries flee, and the enemy hews down countless hosts of men like trees in a forest (<a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-20.htm">Jeremiah 46:20-23</a>). Egypt will be given into the hand of the people out of the north; for Jahveh will punish gods, princes, and people, and deliver up Egypt to the king of Babylon. But afterwards, Egypt will again be inhabited as it was before (<a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-24.htm">Jeremiah 46:24-26</a>). On the other hand, Israel need fear nothing, for their God will lead them back out of their captivity (<a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-27.htm">Jeremiah 46:27</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/46-28.htm">Jeremiah 46:28</a>).</body></html>
