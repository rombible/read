For the Egyptians should certainly be overthrown, either by the Chaldeans stumbling upon the Babylonians, or the Babylonians on them, or they (fleeing) for haste stumbling one upon another, so as both those that went before, and those who followed after, should both fall together. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/46.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>The nations have heard of thy shame,....

On every side there is danger;" and this is appropriately followed by the imperatives in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-6.htm">Jeremiah 46:6</a>, "Let no one, then, attempt to flee; not one shall escape to Egypt, but they must fall at the Euphrates."
