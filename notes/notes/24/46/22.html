Here the serpent is represented as hissing in its rage and terror in the forest against which the enemies are advancing. The sign then gives way to the thing signified, and the latter clause of the verse brings before us the hosts of the Chaldæan allies, barbarous tribes like the Scythians, Massagetæ, and Sacæ, armed with axes instead of swords or spears (Herod. i. 275, iv. 5). They come, but it is to cut down the trees of the forest, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the symbols of the power of Egypt, and there is no power to resist them (<a href="/isaiah/10-33.htm" title="Behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, shall lop the bough with terror: and the high ones of stature shall be hewn down, and the haughty shall be humbled.">Isaiah 10:33</a>). The forest is so dense that the trees cannot be counted, but the fellers of the trees are as numerous, and the forest is destined to destruction at the hands of “the people of the north.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/46.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/jeremiah/46-22.htm" title="The voice thereof shall go like a serpent; for they shall march with an army, and come against her with axes, as hewers of wood....">Jeremiah 46:22-23</a></span>. <span class="ital">The voice thereof shall go like a serpent </span>— “That is, her (Egypt’s) voice shall be low and inarticulate through fear.

Armies are often compared to grasshoppers and such like insects, both for their multitudes, and because they make a general consumption, grasshoppers devouring all before them, wherever they come: see <a href="/judges/6-5.htm" title="For they came up with their cattle and their tents, and they came as grasshoppers for multitude; for both they and their camels were without number: and they entered into the land to destroy it.">Jdg 6:5</a>; <a href="/judges/7-12.htm" title="And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand by the sea side for multitude.">Jdg 7:12</a>; <a href="/context/joel/2-4.htm" title="The appearance of them is as the appearance of horses; and as horsemen, so shall they run....">Joel 2:4-5</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/46.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>46:13-28 Those who encroached on others, shall now be themselves encroached on.

That is, the voice of Egypt, before compared to a heifer, when in its glory; but now it shall not bellow like a heifer in fat pasture, bat hiss like a serpent, when drove out of its hole, and pursued; signifying, that their voice should be low and submissive, and should not speak one big or murmuring word to their conquerors. The voice of the serpent is, by Aristotle (m) said to be small and weak; so Aelianus (n). Though Jarchi, Kimchi, and Abarbinel, understand it of the voice of serpents heard afar off; and so it may respect the dreadful lamentation the Egyptians should make, when they should see the Chaldeans come upon them to destroy them; just as serpents in woods make a horrible noise, when they are set on fire, or are cut down, to which there is an allusion in some following clauses. The Targum seems to interpret this of the Chaldean army thus, <p>"the voice of the clashing of their arms as serpents creeping;'' <p>and of them the following words are certainly meant: <p>for they shall march with an army; the Targum adds, against you; the meaning is, that the Chaldeans should come with a great army, and march against the Egyptians with great strength, force, and fury: <p>and come against her with axes, as hewers of wood; with battle axes, as if they came to cut down trees; nor would they spare the Egyptians any more than such hewers do the trees; nor would they be able any more to resist them than trees can resist hewers of wood. <p>(m) Hist.

The voice of Egypt in her feebleness as she flees away from the enemy shall be like the voice of a serpent hissing, i.e. like a serpent hissing impotently at the woodcutters who disturb its retreat through the thick underwood. For “as it goeth” the LXX (but probably through an early confusion between two Greek words on the part of a scribe) read “hissing.” The serpent formed an important feature in the religion of the Egyptians, who worshipped Kneph under this form. The hostile army is likened in these. <span class="ital">vv</span>. to a host of persons clearing away a forest for firewood. The denseness of the forest represents the number and populous character of the cities of Egypt. Dr. compares <a href="/isaiah/10-18.htm" title="And shall consume the glory of his forest, and of his fruitful field, both soul and body: and they shall be as when a standard-bearer faints.">Isaiah 10:18</a> f., 33 f.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">with axes</span>] This would make a deep impression upon the mind of nations like the Jews, who had no such custom. “The battle-axe was a weapon but rarely employed by the Assyrians. It is only in the very latest sculptures, and in a very few instances, that we find axes represented as used by the warriors for any other purpose besides the felling of trees.

Egypt, or, more strictly, Egypt's grandeur - its rich and complex national life, its splendid cities, its powerful army, all combined in one, is now compared to a forest (comp. <a href="/jeremiah/21-14.htm">Jeremiah 21:14</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/22-6.htm">Jeremiah 22:6, 7</a>; <a href="/isaiah/2-13.htm">Isaiah 2:13</a>; <a href="/isaiah/10-18.htm">Isaiah 10:18, 19, 33, 34</a>). It seems far fetched to suppose, with Graf and Dr. Payne Smith, that the comparison of the Chaldean warriors to wood cutters arose from their being armed with axes. It is probably true that the Israelites did not use the battle axe, but the axe is merely an accident of the description. It is the forest which suggests the mention of the axe, not the axe that of the forest, and forests were familiar enough to the Israelites. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/46.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>As the mighty one of Egypt does not stand, but is thrust down by God, so Jahveh makes many stumble and fall over one another, so that the strangers return to their own home in order to escape the violence of the sword.
