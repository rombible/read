Those that were swift of foot, like Asahel, or carried but light armour, let not such trust to their swiftness or light carriage; nor let the mighty man think to escape by reason of his great strength, to make his way through the enemy, and get out of his hands. Or this may be rendered as future, "the swift shall not flee away", &amp;c. (t) so the Targum; neither the one nor the other shall escape by the nimbleness of their heels, or the stoutness of their hearts: <p>they shall stumble and fall toward the north, by the river Euphrates; which lay north of Judea, where the prophet was, to whom this word came; and also was to the north of Egypt, whose destruction is here threatened: the place where this route and slaughter would be made was Carchemish, which was situated by that river; on the north side of which city, according to Abarbinel, the battle was; and which sense is mentioned by Kimchi, which the other follows. <p>(t)  "non fugiet", Pagninus, Montanus; "non effugiet", Munster, Tigurine version. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/46.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Let not the swift flee away, nor the mighty man escape; they shall stumble, and fall toward the <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> north by the river Euphrates.</span><p>(e) The Babylonians will discomfit them at the river Euphrates.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/46.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let not the swift flee away.</span> A strong way of expressing that even the swiftest <span class="accented">cannot</span> expect to flee, just as, in <a href="/isaiah/2-9.htm">Isaiah 2:9</a>, "forgive them not" means "thou canst not forgive them."

"To seek for great things," i.e., to ask for things which in general or under certain circumstances are unattainable (cf. <a href="/psalms/131-1.htm">Psalm 131:1</a>), is here used with reference to worldly prosperity. When the whole world is visited with judgment, an individual man must not make great demands, but be content with saving his life. This is promised to Baruch in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/45-5.htm">Jeremiah 45:5</a>, to alleviate his pain and sorrow. "To give life to any one for booty," means to let him escape with his life; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/21-9.htm">Jeremiah 21:9</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/38-2.htm">Jeremiah 38:2</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/39-18.htm">Jeremiah 39:18</a>. In the words, "in all places whither thou shalt go," it is intimated that he will be obliged to avoid destruction by flight, but will thereby save his life. </body></html>
