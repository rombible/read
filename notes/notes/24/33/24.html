The words “this people,” however, used as they are invariably of that to which the prophet himself belonged (<a href="/jeremiah/4-10.htm" title="Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! surely you have greatly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, You shall have peace; whereas the sword reaches to the soul.">Jeremiah 4:10</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/5-14.htm" title="Why thus said the LORD God of hosts, Because you speak this word, behold, I will make my words in your mouth fire, and this people wood, and it shall devour them.">Jeremiah 5:14</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/5-23.htm" title="But this people has a revolting and a rebellious heart; they are revolted and gone.">Jeremiah 5:23</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/6-19.htm" title="Hear, O earth: behold, I will bring evil on this people, even the fruit of their thoughts, because they have not listened to my words, nor to my law, but rejected it.">Jeremiah 6:19</a>, and elsewhere), and indeed in the hundred or more passages in which the phrase occurs in the Old Testament, lead to a different conclusion. The prophet’s declaration of the steadfastness of God’s covenant was made in answer, not to the taunts of the heathen, but to the despair of Israel, such as had found utterance in the words recorded in <a href="/jeremiah/33-10.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; Again there shall be heard in this place, which you say shall be desolate without man and without beast, even in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, that are desolate, without man, and without inhabitant, and without beast,">Jeremiah 33:10</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/32-43.htm" title="And fields shall be bought in this land, whereof you say, It is desolate without man or beast; it is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.">Jeremiah 32:43</a>. If the words “thus they have despised my people” seem to favour the former interpretation, it must be remembered that the subject of the verb is not necessarily the same as that of the previous clause, and that the scorn of other nations would be the natural outcome of the despondency into which Israel had fallen; or they might emphasise the fact that the despondency was itself, as it were, suicidal. Those who despised their own nation were despising the people of Jehovah. In contrast with this despondency, the prophet renews his assurance of the permanence of the kingly and priestly lines, and strengthens it by reference to the three great patriarchs of the race, with whom the truth of Jehovah’s promises was identified (<a href="/exodus/3-15.htm" title="And God said moreover to Moses, Thus shall you say to the children of Israel, the LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you: this is my name for ever, and this is my memorial to all generations.">Exodus 3:15</a>), and by connecting it with the promise of a return from the captivity. When that return came, it would be the pledge and earnest of the yet greater blessings which were involved in the new and everlasting covenant.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/33.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/jeremiah/33-24.htm" title="Consider you not what this people have spoken, saying, The two families which the LORD has chosen, he has even cast them off? thus they have despised my people, that they should be no more a nation before them....">Jeremiah 33:24-26</a>. </span><span class="ital">The two families which the Lord hath chosen </span>— “It is plain from <a href="/jeremiah/33-26.htm" title="Then will I cast away the seed of Jacob and David my servant, so that I will not take any of his seed to be rulers over the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: for I will cause their captivity to return, and have mercy on them.">Jeremiah 33:26</a>,” says Blaney,” that the two families here meant are those of Jacob and David, though some have supposed the two kingdoms of Israel and Judah, others the royal and sacerdotal families of David and Levi, to be intended.” <span class="ital">He hath even cast them off </span>— The words are spoken by those unbelieving Jews who thought God would never restore them to their former condition, nor give them again a king of the seed of David, thus indirectly accusing him of a breach of promise. <span class="ital">Thus they have despised my people, </span>&c. — Thus, saith God, they have spoken in a reproachful and degrading manner of my people, as if they should never be a nation again, having rulers of themselves and a ministry. <span class="ital">If my covenant be not with day and night, </span>&c. — If I have not appointed the vicissitudes of day and night, and of summer and winter, upon which the seasons of the year and the fruitfulness of the earth depend; <span class="ital">then will I cast away the seed of Jacob </span>— Then will I finally, and for ever, abandon the body of the Jews and Israelites; <span class="ital">and David my servant </span>— Namely, the seed of David, all persons lineally descended from him, so that none of them shall ever hereafter reign over Israel and Judah. The sum of these verses is plainly this, that a restoration of them to their own land should as certainly succeed their captivity as the day succeeds the night, or summer follows winter. God had as certainly ordained the one as the other, and, would as certainly have mercy on his people as he would certainly continue the revolutions of the heavenly bodies. And in showing this mercy he would take care that one of the seed of David should be their ruler: which has been, and still more fully shall be, fulfilled in the Messiah, who shall always as certainly govern his church, whether consisting of converted Jews or Gentiles, as there will always be a church on earth to be governed. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/33.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>33:14-26 To crown the blessings God has in store, here is a promise of the Messiah. He imparts righteousness to his church, for he is made of God to us righteousness; and believers are made the righteousness of God in him. Christ is our Lord God, our righteousness, our sanctification, and our redemption. His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom. But in this world prosperity and adversity succeed each other, as light and darkness, day and night. The covenant of priesthood shall be secured. And all true believers are a holy priesthood, a royal priesthood, they offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God; themselves, in the first place, as living sacrifices. The promises of that covenant shall have full accomplishment in the gospel Israel. In Ga 6:16, all that walk according to the gospel rule, are made to be the Israel of God, on whom shall be peace and mercy.

D. Michaelis and Jahn have considered it spurious. To these must be added Movers, who takes <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-18.htm">Jeremiah 33:18</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-21.htm">Jeremiah 33:21-25</a> as later interpolations, and Hitzig, who treats the whole passage as a series of separate additions made in a later age. On the other side, Kueper, Wichelhaus, and Hengstenberg (Christology, vol. ii. pp. 459-461 of Clark's Translation) have shown the utter worthlessness of these reasons, and Graf also has defended the genuineness of the passage. So too has Ewald, who says (Propheten, ii. 269), "Nothing can be so preposterous and unreasonable as to find in this passage, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-19.htm">Jeremiah 33:19-26</a>, or in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/30.htm">Jeremiah 30-33</a> generally, additions by a later prophet.")<p>The promise in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-14.htm">Jeremiah 33:14-16</a> has already been given in substance in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5-6</a>, and in our verses it is only formally extended, and thereby made more prominent. In <a href="/jeremiah/33-14.htm">Jeremiah 33:14</a> it is designated as the establishment, i.e., the realization, of the good word which the Lord has spoken concerning Israel and Judah. "The good word" is, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-1.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-14</a>, the blessing which the Lord has promised to His people if they obey His commands; cf. <a href="/1_kings/8-56.htm">1 Kings 8:56</a>. Here also must "the good word" be taken in the same general meaning; for our verse forms the transition from the promise of the restoration and blessing of Israel in the future (<a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-6.htm">Jeremiah 33:6-13</a>) to the special promise of the renewal and completion of the Davidic monarchy (<a href="/jeremiah/33-15.htm">Jeremiah 33:15</a>.). In <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10</a>, on the contrary, "the good word" is specially referred, by the following infinitival clause, to the deliverance of the people from Babylon. But it is unlikely that "the good word" refers to the "sprout" of David, which is expressly promised in <a href="/jeremiah/23-5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5</a>., and repeated here, <a href="/jeremiah/33-15.htm">Jeremiah 33:15</a>.; for here a like promise to the Levites follows, while there is none in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/23.htm">Jeremiah 23</a>, and it is here so closely linked with the promise regarding David, that it must be viewed as a portion of the "good word." In the change from &#1488;&#1500; to &#1506;&#1500; in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-14.htm">Jeremiah 33:14</a>, we must not, with Hengstenberg, seek a real difference; for in Jeremiah these prepositions often interchange without any difference of meaning, as in <a href="/jeremiah/11-2.htm">Jeremiah 11:2</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/18-11.htm">Jeremiah 18:11</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-35.htm">Jeremiah 23:35</a>, etc. The blessing promised to the people in the "good word" culminates in the promise, <a href="/jeremiah/33-15.htm">Jeremiah 33:15</a>., that the Lord will cause a righteous sprout to spring up for David. On the meaning of this promise, see the remarks on <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5-6</a>. The difference made in the repetition of that promise is really unimportant. &#1488;&#1510;&#1502;&#1497;&#1495; instead of &#1492;&#1511;&#1502;&#1514;&#1497; does not change the sense. &#1492;&#1510;&#1502;&#1497;&#1495;, to cause to sprout of grow, corresponds to the figure of the &#1510;&#1502;&#1495;, under which the Messiah is represented in both passages. &#1510;&#1502;&#1495; &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1492; is only a more sonorous expression for &#1510;&#1502;&#1495; &#1510;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1511;. The words "He shall rule as king and deal wisely," which in <a href="/jeremiah/23-5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5</a> bring into prominence the contrast between the kingdom of the Messiah and that of the godless shepherd of the people, were unnecessary for the connection of our passage. Besides, in <a href="/jeremiah/23-6.htm">Jeremiah 23:6</a> Israel is named together with Judah, instead of which, we have here, in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-16.htm">Jeremiah 33:16</a>, Jerusalem; accordingly, the name "Jahveh Tsidkenu" is referred to Jerusalem, while in <a href="/jeremiah/23-6.htm">Jeremiah 23:6</a> it is predicated of the sprout of David. The mention of Jerusalem instead of Israel is connected with the general scope of our prophecy, viz., to comfort the covenant people over the destruction of Jerusalem (<a href="/jeremiah/33-4.htm">Jeremiah 33:4</a>.). But that, through the mention simply of Judah and its capital, the ten tribes are not to be excluded from participation in the coming prosperity, may be seen even from <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-14.htm">Jeremiah 33:14</a>, where "the good word" is referred to Israel and Judah, and still more plainly from <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-24.htm">Jeremiah 33:24</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-26.htm">Jeremiah 33:26</a>, where this promise is made sure to the whole seed of Israel. The transference of the name Jahveh Tsidkenu from the sprout of David to the city of Jerusalem is connected with the fact, that the name only expresses what the Messiah will bring to the people (see <a href="/jeremiah/23-6.htm">Jeremiah 23:6</a>); the righteousness which He works in and on Jerusalem may, without changing the substance of the thought, be attributed to Jerusalem itself, inasmuch as Jerusalem reflects the righteousness which is bestowed on her by the Messiah.<p>This promise is, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-17.htm">Jeremiah 33:17</a>, further confirmed by the renewal of that which the Lord had given King David, through Nathan the prophet, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>, and that, too, in the form in which David himself had expressed it in his address to Solomon, shortly before his death, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/2-4.htm">1 Kings 2:4</a>, and in which Solomon had repeated it, <a href="/1_kings/8-25.htm">1 Kings 8:25</a> and <a href="/1_kings/9-5.htm">1 Kings 9:5</a>. The formula &#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;, "there never will be cut off from David one sitting," etc., has the meaning, David will never want a descendant to occupy his throne; or, the posterity of David will possess the kingdom for ever. A temporary loss of the throne is not thereby excluded, but only such a permanent loss as would be caused by the family of David becoming extinct, or by the kingdom in Israel either passing over to some other family, or in some way or other coming to an end; see on <a href="/1_kings/2-4.htm">1 Kings 2:4</a>. - The very same promise is given to the Levitical priests, i.e., the priests of the tribe or family of Levi (&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; as in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-9.htm">Deuteronomy 17:9</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/17-18.htm">Deuteronomy 17:18</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-1.htm">Deuteronomy 18:1</a>, etc.). They shall never want one to bring and prepare an offering before the Lord. Burnt-offering, meat-offering, and sin-offering are the three species of sacrifice which were to be brought, according to the law, as in <a href="/jeremiah/17-26.htm">Jeremiah 17:26</a>. By means of the apposition "the Levites," the priests are designated as the legitimate priesthood, established as such in virtue of God's choice of the tribe of Levi, in contrast with priests such as Jeroboam appointed, out of the common people, for the worship set up by him. Not only shall Israel have priests, but priests out of the tribe of Levi, which was chosen by God for the sacerdotal office, as the medium of communicating His gracious gifts. The designation of the priests as "the Levites" corresponds, accordingly, to the kings of the family of David. Such a view explains this addition to our passage, to which critics such as Hitzig have taken objection. The Davidic kingdom and the Levitical priesthood were the two pillars and bases of the Old Testament theocracy, on which its existence and continuance depended. The priesthood formed the medium of approach for the people into divine favour. The kingdom assured them of the divine guidance.<p>(Note: Continebatur autem salus populi duabus istis partibus. Nam, sine rege, erant veluti corpus truncum aut mutilum; sine sacerdote mera erat dissipatio. Nam sacerdos erat quasi medius inter Deum et populum, rex autem representabat Dei personam. - Calvin.)<p>Both of these pillars were broken with the destruction of Jerusalem and of the temple; the theocracy the appeared to have ceased to exist. At this time, when the kingdom, with its ordinances of justice and of grace, bestowed by God, was being dissolved, the Lord, in order to keep His people from despair, declares that these two institutions, in accordance with His promise, shall not fall to the ground, but shall stand for ever. By this, God's own people received a pledge for the re-establishment and renovation of the kingdom of God. Such is the object of this promise. - As to the kind and mode of reinstitution of both of these ordinances, which were abolished when the state came to ruin, the prophecy now before us gives no explanation; but in the emphatic confirmation of the prophecy which follows, we find brief indications which clearly show that the restoration spoken of will not be a reinstitution of the old form which is now perishing, but a renovation of it, in its essential features, to a permanent existence.<p>The confirmations of these promises, which follow them in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-19.htm">Jeremiah 33:19-26</a>, are each introduced by separate headings, perhaps not merely to render them more prominent, but because the Lord revealed them separately to the prophet; but it by no means follows from this that they are later additions, without any connection. <a href="/jeremiah/33-20.htm">Jeremiah 33:20</a>. "If ye shall break my covenant with the day,...then also will my covenant with David...be broken." This if betokens the impossible; man cannot alter the arrangement in nature for the regular alternation of day and night. &#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1501; and &#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492; are in apposition to &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497;, "my covenant the day - the night," for "my covenant with regard to the day and the night, which is this, that day and night shall return at their appointed times." The &#1493; before &#1500;&#1489;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; is explanatory. &#1497;&#1493;&#1502;&#1501;&#1470;&#1493;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492; are adverbs, "day and night," for "the regular alternation of day and night." These divine arrangements in nature are called a covenant; because God, after the flood, gave a pledge that they should uninterruptedly continue, in a covenant made with the human race; cf. <a href="/genesis/9-9.htm">Genesis 9:9</a> with <a href="/genesis/8-22.htm">Genesis 8:22</a>. As this covenant of nature cannot be broken by men, so also the covenant of grace of the Lord with David and the Levites cannot be broken, i.e., annulled. The covenant with David consisted in the promise that his kingdom should endure for ever (see <a href="/jeremiah/33-17.htm">Jeremiah 33:17</a>); that with the Levites, in the eternal possession of the right to the priesthood. The institution of the priesthood is certainly not represented in the law as a covenant; it consisted merely in the choice of Aaron and his sons as priests by God, <a href="/exodus/28-1.htm">Exodus 28:1</a>. But, inasmuch as they were thereby brought into a peculiar relation to the Lord, and thus had vouchsafed to them not merely privileges and promises, but also had laid on them duties, the fulfilment of which was a condition of receiving the privileges, this relation might be called a covenant; and indeed, in <a href="/numbers/25-11.htm">Numbers 25:11</a>., the promise given to Phinehas, that he should have the priesthood as an eternal possession, is called a covenant of peace and an eternal covenant of priesthood. This promise concerned the whole priesthood in the person of Phinehas, and the Levites also, inasmuch as the Levites were given to the priests; hence there is mention made in <a href="//biblehub.com/malachi/2-4.htm">Malachi 2:4</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/malachi/2-8.htm">Malachi 2:8</a>, of a covenant with Levi. In this prophecy, too, mention is made of the priests alone. The general idea contained in the words "the Levites," placed first, is more clearly defined by the apposition "the priests," and restricted to the priests of the tribe of Levi.</body></html>
