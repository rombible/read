Promises are given, not to do away, but to quicken and encourage prayer. These promises lead us to the gospel of Christ; and in that God has revealed truth to direct us, and peace to make us easy. All who by sanctifying grace are cleansed from the filth of sin, by pardoning mercy are freed from the guilt. When sinners are thus justified, washed, and sanctified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Holy Spirit, they are enabled to walk before God in peace and purity. Many are led to perceive the real difference between the people of God and the world around them, and to fear the Divine wrath. It is promised that the people who were long in sorrow, shall again be filled with joy. Where the Lord gives righteousness and peace, he will give all needful supplies for temporal wants; and all we have will be comforts, as sanctified by the word and by prayer.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/33.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Or, Thus saith Yahweh the doer of it, Yahweh who formeth it, that He may establish it, Yahweh is His name.

The Syriac version is, "that made thee"; the prophet. The Septuagint and Arabic versions are, "the Maker of the earth"; see <a href="/jeremiah/32-17.htm">Jeremiah 32:17</a>. Kimchi interprets it of Jerusalem; rather it is to be understood of the New Jerusalem, or church of God in Gospel times. Jarchi seems to understand it of this prophecy or promise, and so others; the promise of restoring and rebuilding Jerusalem; which, if taken of the church of God, may be admitted; <p>the Lord that formed it, to establish it; who drew the scheme and model of this spiritual building, his church, in his eternal mind, and resolved upon its stability and glory; who forms it, and everyone in it, for himself, and for his praise, in order to establish it in the world; as it will be more especially in the latter day: we often read of the Lord's establishing his church and people in the world, <a href="/psalms/48-8.htm">Psalm 48:8</a>; <p>the Lord is his name; Jehovah, the self-existing Being, the Being of beings; who is able to perform whatever he undertakes, and so is equal to this work, of settling and establishing his interest. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/33.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Thus saith the LORD the <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> maker of this, the LORD that formed it, to establish it; the LORD <i>is</i> his name;</span><p>(b) That is, of Jerusalem, who as he made it, so will he preserve it, read Isa 37:26.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/33.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2</span>. <span class="ital">the Lord is his name</span>] He is God and not man, and so is unchangeable and omnipotent. A similar expression is frequent in Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/47-4.htm" title="As for our redeemer, the LORD of hosts is his name, the Holy One of Israel.">Isaiah 47:4</a>, <a href="/isaiah/48-2.htm" title="For they call themselves of the holy city, and stay themselves on the God of Israel; The LORD of hosts is his name.">Isaiah 48:2</a>, etc.). Cp. <a href="/jeremiah/10-16.htm" title="The portion of Jacob is not like them: for he is the former of all things; and Israel is the rod of his inheritance: The LORD of hosts is his name.">Jeremiah 10:16</a>, in connexion, as here, with Jehovah as Creator (“former”) of all things.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">2, 3</span>. These <span class="ital">vv</span>. bear a close affinity to several passages in 2 Isaiah (e.g. <a href="/isaiah/45-18.htm" title="For thus said the LORD that created the heavens; God himself that formed the earth and made it; he has established it, he created it not in vain, he formed it to be inhabited: I am the LORD; and there is none else.">Isaiah 45:18</a>, <a href="/isaiah/48-6.htm" title="You have heard, see all this; and will not you declare it? I have showed you new things from this time, even hidden things, and you did not know them.">Isaiah 48:6</a>), and are probably an insertion by a later hand. For the indefinite “that doeth it,” etc., which in the Hebrew still more than the English resembles <a href="/isaiah/22-11.htm" title="You made also a ditch between the two walls for the water of the old pool: but you have not looked to the maker thereof, neither had respect to him that fashioned it long ago.">Isaiah 22:11</a> (cp. <span class="ital"><a href="/jeremiah/33-4.htm" title="For thus said the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city, and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah, which are thrown down by the mounts, and by the sword;">Jeremiah 33:4</a></span> f. here with <a href="/isaiah/22-10.htm" title="And you have numbered the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses have you broken down to fortify the wall.">Isaiah 22:10</a>), we should probably read with LXX “who made the earth and formed it to establish it.” Cp. <a href="/isaiah/45-18.htm" title="For thus said the LORD that created the heavens; God himself that formed the earth and made it; he has established it, he created it not in vain, he formed it to be inhabited: I am the LORD; and there is none else.">Isaiah 45:18</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/33.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thus saith the Lord, the Maker thereof,</span> etc.; rather, <span class="accented">Thus saith Jehovah</span>, <span class="accented">who doeth it, Jehovah who frameth it that he may establish it, whose name is Jehovah.</span> It was needless to express the object of the verbs. Jehovah's great purpose is the regeneration of his people. To "frame" or "form" is synonomous with "purpose" (see on. <a href="/jeremiah/38-11.htm">Jeremiah 38:11</a>). The meaning of the verse is that Jehovah's very Name is a pledge of his fidelity to his promises (comp. <a href="/jeremiah/32-18.htm">Jeremiah 32:18</a>). To "establish" is synonymous with "to carry out." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/32.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div><a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-38.htm">Jeremiah 32:38</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/32-39.htm">Jeremiah 32:39</a> are to be understood like <a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>. They must in very deed become the people of the Lord, for God gives them one heart and one way of life, to fear Him always, i.e., through His Spirit He renews and sanctifies them (<a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/24-7.htm">Jeremiah 24:7</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/11-19.htm">Jeremiah 11:19</a>). "One heart and one way" that they may all with one mind and in one way fear me, no longer wander through many wicked ways (<a href="/jeremiah/26-3.htm">Jeremiah 26:3</a>; <a href="/isaiah/53-6.htm">Isaiah 53:6</a>). &#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; is an infinitive, as often in Deut., e.g., <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-10.htm">Jeremiah 4:10</a>, from which the whole sentence has been derived, and <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-24.htm">Jeremiah 6:24</a>, to which the expression &#1500;&#1496;&#1493;&#1489; &#1500;&#1492;&#1501; points. The everlasting covenant which the Lord wishes to conclude with them, i.e., the covenant-relationship which He desires to grant them, is, in fact, the new covenant, <a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>. Here, however, only the eternal duration of it is made prominent, in order to comfort the pious in the midst of their present sufferings. Consequently, only the idea of the &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501; is mainly set forth: "that I shall not turn away from them, to do them good - no more withdraw from them my gracious benefits;" but the uninterrupted bestowal of these implies also faithfulness to the Lord on the part of the people. The Lord desires to establish His redeemed people in this condition by putting His fear in their heart, namely, through His Spirit; see <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33-34</a>. &#1493;&#1513;&#1474;&#1513;&#1474;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, "And I shall rejoice over them, by doing them good," as was formerly the case (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-63.htm">Deuteronomy 28:63</a>), and is again to be, in time to come. &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1514;, in truth, properly, "in faithfulness." This expression is strengthened by the addition, "with my whole heart and my whole soul." - So much for the promise of restoration and renewal of the covenant people. This promise is confirmed, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-42.htm">Jeremiah 32:42-44</a>, by the assurance that the accomplishment of deliverance shall follow as certainly as the decree of the calamity has done; the change is similar to that in <a href="/jeremiah/31-38.htm">Jeremiah 31:38</a>. Finally, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-43.htm">Jeremiah 32:43</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-44.htm">Jeremiah 32:44</a>, there is the application made of this to the purchase of the field which the prophet had been commanded to fulfil; and the signification of this purchase is thus far determined, that after the restoration of Judah to their own land, fields shall once more be bought in full legal form: with this, the discourse returns to its starting-point, and finishes. The article is used generically in &#1492;&#1513;&#1474;&#1491;&#1492;; hence, on the repetition of the thought, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-44.htm">Jeremiah 32:44</a>, the plural &#1513;&#1474;&#1491;&#1493;&#1514; is employed instead. The enumeration of the several regions of the kingdom, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-26.htm">Jeremiah 17:26</a>, is a rhetorical individualization for strengthening the thought. The land of Benjamin is here made prominent in relation to the field purchased by Jeremiah at Anathoth in the land of Benjamin. The final sentence '&#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489;  also serves for further proof. The Hiphil in this expression does not mean the same as the usual &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;: "I turn the captivity," i.e., I change the adversity into prosperity. &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489; expresses restitutio in statum incolumitatis seu integritatis more plainly than &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; - not merely the change of misfortune or misery; but it properly means, to lead back or restore the captivity, i.e., to remove the condition of adversity by restoration of previous prosperity. The expression is analogous to &#1511;&#1493;&#1502;&#1501; or &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; &#1495;&#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;, to build or raise ruins, <a href="/isaiah/44-26.htm">Isaiah 44:26</a>; <a href="/isaiah/58-12.htm">Isaiah 58:12</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/61-4.htm">Isaiah 61:4</a>, and &#1511;&#1493;&#1502;&#1501; &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, to raise up desolate places, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/61-4.htm">Isaiah 61:4</a>, which does not mean to restore ruins or desolate places, but to build them up into inhabitable places (cf. <a href="/isaiah/61-4.htm">Isaiah 61:4</a>), to remove ruins or desolations by the building and restoration of cities. </body></html>
