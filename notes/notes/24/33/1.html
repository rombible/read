Promises are given, not to do away, but to quicken and encourage prayer. These promises lead us to the gospel of Christ; and in that God has revealed truth to direct us, and peace to make us easy. All who by sanctifying grace are cleansed from the filth of sin, by pardoning mercy are freed from the guilt. When sinners are thus justified, washed, and sanctified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Holy Spirit, they are enabled to walk before God in peace and purity. Many are led to perceive the real difference between the people of God and the world around them, and to fear the Divine wrath. It is promised that the people who were long in sorrow, shall again be filled with joy. Where the Lord gives righteousness and peace, he will give all needful supplies for temporal wants; and all we have will be comforts, as sanctified by the word and by prayer.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/33.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The prison - The guard. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/33.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 33<p>Jer 33:1-26.

Jeremiah was forced out of the temple, God followeth him to the prison, and there revealeth his mind to him once and again.

They must in very deed become the people of the Lord, for God gives them one heart and one way of life, to fear Him always, i.e., through His Spirit He renews and sanctifies them (<a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/24-7.htm">Jeremiah 24:7</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/11-19.htm">Jeremiah 11:19</a>). "One heart and one way" that they may all with one mind and in one way fear me, no longer wander through many wicked ways (<a href="/jeremiah/26-3.htm">Jeremiah 26:3</a>; <a href="/isaiah/53-6.htm">Isaiah 53:6</a>). &#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; is an infinitive, as often in Deut., e.g., <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-10.htm">Jeremiah 4:10</a>, from which the whole sentence has been derived, and <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-24.htm">Jeremiah 6:24</a>, to which the expression &#1500;&#1496;&#1493;&#1489; &#1500;&#1492;&#1501; points. The everlasting covenant which the Lord wishes to conclude with them, i.e., the covenant-relationship which He desires to grant them, is, in fact, the new covenant, <a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>. Here, however, only the eternal duration of it is made prominent, in order to comfort the pious in the midst of their present sufferings. Consequently, only the idea of the &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501; is mainly set forth: "that I shall not turn away from them, to do them good - no more withdraw from them my gracious benefits;" but the uninterrupted bestowal of these implies also faithfulness to the Lord on the part of the people. The Lord desires to establish His redeemed people in this condition by putting His fear in their heart, namely, through His Spirit; see <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33-34</a>. &#1493;&#1513;&#1474;&#1513;&#1474;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, "And I shall rejoice over them, by doing them good," as was formerly the case (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-63.htm">Deuteronomy 28:63</a>), and is again to be, in time to come. &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1514;, in truth, properly, "in faithfulness." This expression is strengthened by the addition, "with my whole heart and my whole soul." - So much for the promise of restoration and renewal of the covenant people. This promise is confirmed, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-42.htm">Jeremiah 32:42-44</a>, by the assurance that the accomplishment of deliverance shall follow as certainly as the decree of the calamity has done; the change is similar to that in <a href="/jeremiah/31-38.htm">Jeremiah 31:38</a>. Finally, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-43.htm">Jeremiah 32:43</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-44.htm">Jeremiah 32:44</a>, there is the application made of this to the purchase of the field which the prophet had been commanded to fulfil; and the signification of this purchase is thus far determined, that after the restoration of Judah to their own land, fields shall once more be bought in full legal form: with this, the discourse returns to its starting-point, and finishes. The article is used generically in &#1492;&#1513;&#1474;&#1491;&#1492;; hence, on the repetition of the thought, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-44.htm">Jeremiah 32:44</a>, the plural &#1513;&#1474;&#1491;&#1493;&#1514; is employed instead. The enumeration of the several regions of the kingdom, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-26.htm">Jeremiah 17:26</a>, is a rhetorical individualization for strengthening the thought. The land of Benjamin is here made prominent in relation to the field purchased by Jeremiah at Anathoth in the land of Benjamin. The final sentence '&#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489;  also serves for further proof. The Hiphil in this expression does not mean the same as the usual &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;: "I turn the captivity," i.e., I change the adversity into prosperity. &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489; expresses restitutio in statum incolumitatis seu integritatis more plainly than &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; - not merely the change of misfortune or misery; but it properly means, to lead back or restore the captivity, i.e., to remove the condition of adversity by restoration of previous prosperity. The expression is analogous to &#1511;&#1493;&#1502;&#1501; or &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; &#1495;&#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;, to build or raise ruins, <a href="/isaiah/44-26.htm">Isaiah 44:26</a>; <a href="/isaiah/58-12.htm">Isaiah 58:12</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/61-4.htm">Isaiah 61:4</a>, and &#1511;&#1493;&#1502;&#1501; &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, to raise up desolate places, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/61-4.htm">Isaiah 61:4</a>, which does not mean to restore ruins or desolate places, but to build them up into inhabitable places (cf. <a href="/isaiah/61-4.htm">Isaiah 61:4</a>), to remove ruins or desolations by the building and restoration of cities. </body></html>
