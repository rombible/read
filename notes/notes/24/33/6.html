Promises are given, not to do away, but to quicken and encourage prayer. These promises lead us to the gospel of Christ; and in that God has revealed truth to direct us, and peace to make us easy. All who by sanctifying grace are cleansed from the filth of sin, by pardoning mercy are freed from the guilt. When sinners are thus justified, washed, and sanctified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Holy Spirit, they are enabled to walk before God in peace and purity. Many are led to perceive the real difference between the people of God and the world around them, and to fear the Divine wrath. It is promised that the people who were long in sorrow, shall again be filled with joy. Where the Lord gives righteousness and peace, he will give all needful supplies for temporal wants; and all we have will be comforts, as sanctified by the word and by prayer.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/33.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I will bring it health and cure - I will lay upon it a bandage and healing, i. e., a healing bandage, a plaster with healing medicines. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/33.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6.

That is, the church of God, the members of it, typified by Jerusalem; and it is to be understood of the healing of their spiritual maladies, the diseases of sin, through the blood of the Messiah, who should arise with healing in his wings; that is, with remission of sin, which is often meant by healing in Scripture: Christ is the physician; his blood the balm in Gilead, which being applied to those that are diseased with sin, to sin sick souls, it makes an effectual cure of them; so that they shall not say they are sick, because their iniquities are forgiven them; see <a href="/psalms/103-3.htm">Psalm 103:3</a>; <p>and will reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth; the same with "grace and truth", which are come by Christ, <a href="/john/1-17.htm">John 1:17</a>; under the Old Testament, these were figured out by types and shadows; but not revealed clearly, as under the New Testament, to which this prophecy belongs. "Peace" may intend peace made with God by the blood of Christ; peace of conscience, which he gives, and arises from a sense of pardon and atonement by his blood, and justification by his righteousness; and all kind of spiritual welfare, prosperity, and happiness; of which there will be an abundance, especially in the latter days of the Messiah, <a href="/psalms/72-8.htm">Psalm 72:8</a>. "Truth" may design the faithfulness of God, in fulfilling all his promises and prophecies concerning the Messiah, and salvation by him, and may stand opposed to the types and shadows of the old law; and include the Gospel, the word of truth, and all the doctrines of it; which are clearly and fully revealed by the spirit of truth, wisdom, and revelation, in the knowledge of Christ. Here begins the account of the great, mighty, and hidden things the Lord promised to show the prophet, <a href="/jeremiah/33-3.htm">Jeremiah 33:3</a>. The Targum of this last clause is, <p>"and I will reveal the gate of repentance unto them, and I will show them, how they shall walk in the way of peace and truth;'' <p>and the Syriac version is, <p>"I will reveal unto them the paths of peace and faith;'' <p>but the word here used signifies abundance, as Kimchi and Ben Melech observe. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/33.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Behold, I <span class="cverse3">{f}</span> will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them, and will reveal to them the abundance of peace and truth.</span><p>(f) In the midst of his threatenings God remembers his, and comforts them.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/33.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>. <span class="ital">health</span>] mg. <span class="ital">healing</span>; lit. <span class="ital">fresh flesh</span>; See on <a href="/jeremiah/8-22.htm" title="Is there no balm in Gilead; is there no physician there? why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered?">Jeremiah 8:22</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">abundance</span>] The word in MT. occurs here only, the meaning that the corresponding root bears in <a href="/ezekiel/35-13.htm" title="Thus with your mouth you have boasted against me, and have multiplied your words against me: I have heard them.">Ezekiel 35:13</a>; <a href="/proverbs/27-6.htm" title="Faithful are the wounds of a friend; but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful.">Proverbs 27:6</a>, being taken to justify the sense assigned here.

They must in very deed become the people of the Lord, for God gives them one heart and one way of life, to fear Him always, i.e., through His Spirit He renews and sanctifies them (<a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/24-7.htm">Jeremiah 24:7</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/11-19.htm">Jeremiah 11:19</a>). "One heart and one way" that they may all with one mind and in one way fear me, no longer wander through many wicked ways (<a href="/jeremiah/26-3.htm">Jeremiah 26:3</a>; <a href="/isaiah/53-6.htm">Isaiah 53:6</a>). &#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; is an infinitive, as often in Deut., e.g., <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-10.htm">Jeremiah 4:10</a>, from which the whole sentence has been derived, and <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-24.htm">Jeremiah 6:24</a>, to which the expression &#1500;&#1496;&#1493;&#1489; &#1500;&#1492;&#1501; points. The everlasting covenant which the Lord wishes to conclude with them, i.e., the covenant-relationship which He desires to grant them, is, in fact, the new covenant, <a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>. Here, however, only the eternal duration of it is made prominent, in order to comfort the pious in the midst of their present sufferings. Consequently, only the idea of the &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501; is mainly set forth: "that I shall not turn away from them, to do them good - no more withdraw from them my gracious benefits;" but the uninterrupted bestowal of these implies also faithfulness to the Lord on the part of the people. The Lord desires to establish His redeemed people in this condition by putting His fear in their heart, namely, through His Spirit; see <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33-34</a>. &#1493;&#1513;&#1474;&#1513;&#1474;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, "And I shall rejoice over them, by doing them good," as was formerly the case (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-63.htm">Deuteronomy 28:63</a>), and is again to be, in time to come. &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1514;, in truth, properly, "in faithfulness." This expression is strengthened by the addition, "with my whole heart and my whole soul." - So much for the promise of restoration and renewal of the covenant people. This promise is confirmed, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-42.htm">Jeremiah 32:42-44</a>, by the assurance that the accomplishment of deliverance shall follow as certainly as the decree of the calamity has done; the change is similar to that in <a href="/jeremiah/31-38.htm">Jeremiah 31:38</a>. Finally, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-43.htm">Jeremiah 32:43</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-44.htm">Jeremiah 32:44</a>, there is the application made of this to the purchase of the field which the prophet had been commanded to fulfil; and the signification of this purchase is thus far determined, that after the restoration of Judah to their own land, fields shall once more be bought in full legal form: with this, the discourse returns to its starting-point, and finishes. The article is used generically in &#1492;&#1513;&#1474;&#1491;&#1492;; hence, on the repetition of the thought, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-44.htm">Jeremiah 32:44</a>, the plural &#1513;&#1474;&#1491;&#1493;&#1514; is employed instead. The enumeration of the several regions of the kingdom, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-26.htm">Jeremiah 17:26</a>, is a rhetorical individualization for strengthening the thought. The land of Benjamin is here made prominent in relation to the field purchased by Jeremiah at Anathoth in the land of Benjamin. The final sentence '&#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489;  also serves for further proof. The Hiphil in this expression does not mean the same as the usual &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;: "I turn the captivity," i.e., I change the adversity into prosperity. &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489; expresses restitutio in statum incolumitatis seu integritatis more plainly than &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; - not merely the change of misfortune or misery; but it properly means, to lead back or restore the captivity, i.e., to remove the condition of adversity by restoration of previous prosperity. The expression is analogous to &#1511;&#1493;&#1502;&#1501; or &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; &#1495;&#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;, to build or raise ruins, <a href="/isaiah/44-26.htm">Isaiah 44:26</a>; <a href="/isaiah/58-12.htm">Isaiah 58:12</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/61-4.htm">Isaiah 61:4</a>, and &#1511;&#1493;&#1502;&#1501; &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, to raise up desolate places, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/61-4.htm">Isaiah 61:4</a>, which does not mean to restore ruins or desolate places, but to build them up into inhabitable places (cf. <a href="/isaiah/61-4.htm">Isaiah 61:4</a>), to remove ruins or desolations by the building and restoration of cities. </body></html>
