He imparts righteousness to his church, for he is made of God to us righteousness; and believers are made the righteousness of God in him. Christ is our Lord God, our righteousness, our sanctification, and our redemption. His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom. But in this world prosperity and adversity succeed each other, as light and darkness, day and night. The covenant of priesthood shall be secured. And all true believers are a holy priesthood, a royal priesthood, they offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God; themselves, in the first place, as living sacrifices. The promises of that covenant shall have full accomplishment in the gospel Israel. In Ga 6:16, all that walk according to the gospel rule, are made to be the Israel of God, on whom shall be peace and mercy. Let us not despise the families which were of old the chosen people of God, though for a time they seem to be cast off.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/33.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Compare the marginal reference.

But the name, as always in Scripture, is the expression of the essential nature; the meaning therefore is, "she will develope into a city over which men will rejoice, whenever her name is mentioned." On the following words, "for praise and for glory," i.e., for a subject of praise, etc., cf. <a href="/jeremiah/13-11.htm">Jeremiah 13:11</a>. &#1500;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1497;, "to all," or "among all nations." How far Jerusalem becomes such is shown by the succeeding clauses: "who shall hear...and tremble and quake because of the good," i.e., not from fear "because they are seized with terror through these proofs of the wonderful power of God in contrast with the helplessness of their idols, and through the feeling of their miserable and destitute condition as contrasted with the happiness and prosperity of the people of Israel" (Graf). Against this usual view of the words, it has already been remarked in the Berleburger Bible, that it does not agree with what precedes, viz., with the statement that Jerusalem shall become a name of joy to all nations. Moreover, &#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1491; and &#1512;&#1490;&#1494;, in the sense of fear and terror, are construed with &#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; or &#1502;&#1503;; here, they signify to shake and tremble for joy, like &#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1491; in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/60-5.htm">Isaiah 60:5</a>, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/3-5.htm">Hosea 3:5</a>, i.e., as it is expressed in the Berleburger Bible, "not with a slavish fear, but with the filial fear of penitents, which will also draw and drive them to the reconciled God in Christ, with holy fear and trembling." Calvin had previously recognised this Messianic idea, and fitly elucidated the words thus: haec duo inter se conjuncta, nempe pavor et tremor, qui nos humiliet coram Deo, et fiducia quae nos erigat, ut audeamus familiariter ad ipsum accedere. &#1488;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501; may be for &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501;, cf. <a href="/jeremiah/1-16.htm">Jeremiah 1:16</a>; but probably &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; is construed with a double accusative, as in <a href="/isaiah/42-16.htm">Isaiah 42:16</a>.<p>The prosperity which the Lord designs to procure for His people, is, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-10.htm">Jeremiah 33:10-13</a>, further described in two strophes (<a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-10.htm">Jeremiah 33:10-11</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-12.htm">Jeremiah 33:12-13</a>); in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-10.htm">Jeremiah 33:10</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-11.htm">Jeremiah 33:11</a>, the joyous life of men. In the land now laid waste, gladness and joy shall once more prevail, and God will be praised for this. The description, "it is desolate," etc., does not imply the burning of Jerusalem, <a href="/jeremiah/52-12.htm">Jeremiah 52:12</a>., but only the desolation which began about the end of the siege. "In this place" means "in this land;" this is apparent from the more detailed statement, "in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem." "The voice of gladness," etc., forms the subject of the verb &#1497;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;. On the expression see <a href="/jeremiah/7-34.htm">Jeremiah 7:34</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/16-9.htm">Jeremiah 16:9</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/25-10.htm">Jeremiah 25:10</a>. There is here added: "the voice of those who say, 'Praise the Lord,' " etc. - the usual liturgic formula in thanksgiving to God; cf. <a href="/2_chronicles/5-13.htm">2 Chronicles 5:13</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/7-3.htm">2 Chronicles 7:3</a>; <a href="/ezra/3-11.htm">Ezra 3:11</a>; <a href="/psalms/106-1.htm">Psalm 106:1</a>. &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1491;&#1492;, praise and thanks in word and deed; see <a href="/jeremiah/17-26.htm">Jeremiah 17:26</a>. On &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489; &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; see <a href="/jeremiah/32-44.htm">Jeremiah 32:44</a>. The rendering, "I shall bring back the captives of the land" (here as in <a href="/jeremiah/33-7.htm">Jeremiah 33:7</a>), is both grammatically indefensible, and further, unsuitable: (a) inappropriate, on account of &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492;, for no previous restoration of captives had taken place; the leading of the people out of Egypt is never represented as a bringing back from captivity. And (b) it is grammatically untenable, because restoration to Canaan is expressed either by &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;  &#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488;, after <a href="/deuteronomy/30-5.htm">Deuteronomy 30:5</a>; or by &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489;, with the mention of the place (); cf. <a href="/jeremiah/16-15.htm">Jeremiah 16:15</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/24-6.htm">Jeremiah 24:6</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-37.htm">Jeremiah 32:37</a>, etc. </body></html>
