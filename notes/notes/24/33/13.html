Promises are given, not to do away, but to quicken and encourage prayer. These promises lead us to the gospel of Christ; and in that God has revealed truth to direct us, and peace to make us easy. All who by sanctifying grace are cleansed from the filth of sin, by pardoning mercy are freed from the guilt. When sinners are thus justified, washed, and sanctified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Holy Spirit, they are enabled to walk before God in peace and purity. Many are led to perceive the real difference between the people of God and the world around them, and to fear the Divine wrath. It is promised that the people who were long in sorrow, shall again be filled with joy. Where the Lord gives righteousness and peace, he will give all needful supplies for temporal wants; and all we have will be comforts, as sanctified by the word and by prayer.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/33.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Telleth - i. e., counts the number of his sheep. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/33.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. pass &#8230; under &#8230; hands of him that telleth them&#8212;Shepherds, in sending forth and bringing back their sheep to the folds, count them by striking each as it passes with a rod, implying the shepherd's provident care that not one should be lost (Le 27:32; Mic 7:14; compare Joh 10:28, 29; 17:12).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/33.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> So as to keep tale of them, as it is said they were wont to do both morning and evening in those countries. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/33.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>In the cities of the mountains, in the cities of the vale,  <p>and in the cities of the south,....

The elect of God, who are intended by the "flocks", were in eternal election considered as sheep, and by that act of grace were distinguished from others; and so when an exact account was taken of them, their names were written in heaven, and in the Lamb's book of life; and had this seal and mark put upon them, "the Lord knows them that are his", <a href="/2_timothy/2-19.htm">2 Timothy 2:19</a>; also in the gift of them to Christ; in the covenant of grace, when they were brought into the bond of that covenant, they were likewise considered as sheep, distinct from others; and were told into the hands of Christ, where they are kept, and who has a most perfect knowledge of them; and in the effectual calling they will again pass under his hands; they are then as sheep that had gone astray, returned to the Shepherd and Bishop of their souls; and when they are separated from others, and special knowledge is taken of them, and Christ's mark, the sanctification of the Spirit, is put upon them; and at the last day, when Christ shall deliver them up to the Father, he will say, lo, I and the children, or sheep, whom thou hast given me; and they will all be numbered, and not one will be wanting. <p>(s) "Bisque die numerant, alter pecus, alter et haedos".
