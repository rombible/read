Many can see God's justice and truth with regard to others, who are heedless and blind as to themselves and their own sins. But, sooner or later, all men shall be made sensible that their sin is the cause of all their miseries. Jeremiah has leave to dispose of himself; but is advised to go to Gedaliah, governor of the land under the king of Babylon. It is doubtful whether Jeremiah acted right in this decision. But those who desire the salvation of sinners, and the good of the church, are apt to expect better times from slight appearances, and they will prefer the hope of being useful, to the most secure situations without it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/40.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Now while he was not yet gone back - Most modern commentators render "And as he yet answered nothing, Return then, he said, to Gedaliah ..."<p>Victuals - A ration of food.<p>A reward - A present. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/40.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. while he was not yet gone back&#8212;parenthetical.

If we interpret it of Jeremiah, the sense is, that before Jeremiah was gone out of the presence of Nebuzar-adan, he, either by his silence, or by some declaration of his mind that is not here recorded, declaring that he was more inclined to stay in his own country, Nebuzaradan bid him, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Go back, </span>& c.

We read that the king of Babylon left Gedaliah as his viceroy or deputy in Judah. What he was, more than the son of Ahikam. and grandchild of Shaphan, the Scripture tells us not, only that he was left by the king of Babylon as ruler over the people he thought fit to leave, <span class="bld"><a href="/2_kings/25-22.htm" title="And as for the people that remained in the land of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left, even over them he made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, ruler.">2 Kings 25:22</a></span>; probably he was one of them who, during the siege, had gone out to the king of Babylon: to him the captain of the guard directeth the prophet, but gives him liberty to dwell where he pleaseth; so sends him away with victuals and a reward. It is more than probable that the king of Babylon had heard from some of the Jews, who, during the siege, had made an escape to his army, that the scope of the prophet’s prophecies were for the delivery of the city, and the Jews’ submission to him, as was before said. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/40.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Now while he was not yet gone back, he said, go back also to Gedaliah,.... These words, by different versions, are made difficult to be understood, both, whose words they are, and of whom they are spoken. Jarchi makes them to be words of God, and the sense this, <p>"and by all this he (Jeremiah) had no mind to return; and God said to him, go back to Gedaliah.'' <p>According to the Targum, they are the words of Nebuzaradan, which paraphrases them thus; <p>"if thou wilt not return (that is, with him to Babylon, or rather to Jerusalem, or best to his own native place), or if thou wilt not dwell (that is, in this place), go back to Gedaliah.'' <p>But of whom they are spoken interpreters differ. Some say of Zedekiah, as Cocceius; while he (Zedekiah) does not return, that is, to Jerusalem; which possibly he might, though as yet not determined by the king of Babylon; in the mean while is bid to go to Gedaliah, appointed governor. Others of Gedaliah, thus, while he (Gedaliah) does not return, but stays at Mizpah, go to him thither. Though it seems best to understand it of Jeremiah, who, having had leave from the captain, did not immediately set out anywhere; but, seething to be at a loss which way to go, Nebuzaradan gives him his advice; that seeing he did not care to go to Babylon, that he would go to Gedaliah <p>the son of, Ahikam the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon had made governor over all the cities of Judah, and dwell with him among the people; this was one of the princes of Judah, who, during the siege, went over to the Chaldeans, and who was in great esteem with them; and being, no doubt, recommended to the king of Babylon by his generals, he made him governor of the land under him: <p>or go wherever it seemeth convenient unto thee to go; though he gave him his advice, he did not press it, but left him at full liberty to take his own way, and go into what part of the land he pleased, and settle in it: <p>so the captain of the guard gave him victuals, and a reward, and let him go; the prophet was just come out of prison, and destitute of the necessaries of life, and the land was laid waste by the enemy; and therefore he could not have subsisted without a supply, which was liberally given by the captain; not only food for present refreshment, and sufficient for his journey, which way soever he took, but a present of money or clothes, or both; which was very kind usage of a prophet by a Heathen officer. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/40.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Now while he was not yet gone back, he said, Go back also to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon hath made governor over the cities of Judah, and dwell with him among the people: or go wheresoever it seemeth convenient unto thee to go.

"Now to Jeremiah there had come the word of the Lord, while he remained shut up in the court of the prison, as follows: <a href="/jeremiah/39-16.htm">Jeremiah 39:16</a>. Go and speak to Ebedmelech the Cushite, saying, Thus saith Jahveh of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will bring my words against this city for evil and not for good, and they shall take place before thee on that day. <a href="/jeremiah/39-17.htm">Jeremiah 39:17</a>.

For I will surely save thee, neither shalt thou fall by the sword, and thine own life shall be thy spoil, because thou hast trusted me, saith Jahveh." - This word of God for Ebedmelech came to the prophet, no doubt, very soon after his deliverance from the miry pit by this pious Ethiopian; but it is not given till now, and this by way of supplement, lest its introduction previously should break the chain of events which occurred at the time of that deliverance, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-14.htm">Jeremiah 38:14-39:13</a>. Hence &#1492;&#1497;&#1492;, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-15.htm">Jeremiah 39:15</a>, is to be translated as a pluperfect. "Go and say," etc., is not inconsistent with the fact that Jeremiah, from being in confinement, could not leave the court of the prison. For Ebedmelech could come into the prison, and then Jeremiah could go to him and declare the word of God. "Behold, I will bring my words against this city," i.e., I shall cause the evil with which I have threatened Jerusalem and its inhabitants to come, or, to be accomplished (&#1502;&#1489;&#1497; with &#1488; dropped, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-15.htm">Jeremiah 19:15</a>, and &#1488;&#1500;&#1470; for &#1506;&#1500;). &#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468; &#1500;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1498;, "and these words are to take place before thy face," i.e., thou shalt with thine own eyes behold their fulfilment, &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493;&#1501; &#1492;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;, i.e., at the time of their occurrence.
