Such a recognition did not, however, imply more than the belief of the polytheist, that each nation had its own guardian deity. We find language of a like kind, though spoken with a tone of sarcasm, coming even from the lips of Rab-shakeh (<a href="/2_kings/18-25.htm" title="Am I now come up without the LORD against this place to destroy it? The LORD said to me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.">2Kings 18:25</a>). As a prophet, however, Jeremiah is treated with marked respect—in part, perhaps, due to the policy he had advocated; in part, possibly, to the influence of men like Daniel and his friends at Babylon—and offered the option of going, with the promise of honourable treatment. to that city, from which, however, it is assumed, that he would not return, or remaining in Judaea, to <span class= "ital">go </span>where he will. The prophet obviously chooses the second alternative, but before he acts on it another plan occurs to Nebuzar-adan.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/40.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/jeremiah/40-1.htm" title="The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, after that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah, when he had taken him being bound in chains among all that were carried away captive of Jerusalem and Judah, which were carried away captive to Babylon.">Jeremiah 40:1</a></span>. <span class="ital">The word which came to Jeremiah, </span>&c. — This relates to the prophecy recorded <a href="/jeremiah/42-7.htm" title="And it came to pass after ten days, that the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah.">Jeremiah 42:7</a>, which was occasioned by the story that here follows concerning Ishmael’s conspiracy against Gedaliah. <span class="ital">After that Nebuzar-adan had let him go from Ramah </span>— After Jeremiah was taken out of the court of the prison, he was carried, probably by mistake, expressly contrary to Nebuchadnezzar’s orders, among the other prisoners to Ramah, a city in the tribe of Benjamin near Gibeon.

Many can see God's justice and truth with regard to others, who are heedless and blind as to themselves and their own sins. But, sooner or later, all men shall be made sensible that their sin is the cause of all their miseries. Jeremiah has leave to dispose of himself; but is advised to go to Gedaliah, governor of the land under the king of Babylon. It is doubtful whether Jeremiah acted right in this decision. But those who desire the salvation of sinners, and the good of the church, are apt to expect better times from slight appearances, and they will prefer the hope of being useful, to the most secure situations without it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/40.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>As what follows is mainly a historical narrative, it seems that the title "The word ..." was appropriate not merely to a prediction of the future, but to an account of the past, if written by a prophet.

Nebuzara-dan had his quarters at Ramah, in Benjamin; and there he collected the captives previous to their removal to Babylon (Jer 31:15). He in releasing Jeremiah obeyed the king's commands (Jer 39:11). Jeremiah's "chains" for a time were due to the negligence of those to whom he had been committed; or else to Nebuzara-dan's wish to upbraid the people with their perverse ingratitude in imprisoning Jeremiah [Calvin]; hence he addresses the people (ye &#8230; you) as much as Jeremiah (Jer 40:2, 3).Jeremiah, being set free by Nebuchadnezzar, goeth to Gedaliah, <span class="bld"><a href="/context/jeremiah/40-1.htm" title="The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, after that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah, when he had taken him being bound in chains among all that were carried away captive of Jerusalem and Judah, which were carried away captive to Babylon....">Jeremiah 40:1-6</a></span>, to whom the remaining Jews repair, <span class="bld"><a href="/context/jeremiah/40-7.htm" title="Now when all the captains of the forces which were in the fields, even they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land, and had committed to him men, and women, and children, and of the poor of the land, of them that were not carried away captive to Babylon;...">Jeremiah 40:7-12</a></span>.

The word of prophecy, as the Targum; but there being no prophecy in this and the following chapter, only a narration of facts, this is generally referred to what came ten days after, and which begins <a href="/jeremiah/42-7.htm">Jeremiah 42:7</a>; so Jarchi and Kimchi; all between being included in a parenthesis, or a relation of facts preparatory, to lead on to it; though Abarbinel takes it to be a general title to all histories and prophecies in this book, from henceforward to the end of it. Jarchi and Kimchi make mention of a Midrash, which refers it to the special word of the Lord to Jeremiah to go to Gedaliah, <a href="/jeremiah/40-5.htm">Jeremiah 40:5</a>; interpreting that passage as the words of the Lord, and not of Nebuzaradan; but Abarbinel's sense seems best. The time of this prophecy was <p>after that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah; which was a city in the land of Benjamin near Gibeon, seven miles from Jerusalem, as Jerom (q) says; here Nebuzaradan had his rendezvous, whither he brought his captives as they fell into his hands, among whom were Jeremiah: <p>when he had taken him; out of the court of the prison, and out of Jerusalem, and brought him to Ramah: <p>being bound in chains among all them that were carried away captive of Jerusalem and Judah, that were carried away captive unto Babylon; how it came to pass is not certain, but so it was; that, though by the orders of Nebuzaradan and the princes, agreeably to the command of the king of Babylon, Jeremiah was taken out of the court of the prison, yet was not set free; but without the knowledge of Nebuzaradan, and through the inadvertency of inferior officers, he was taken and bound, and with other prisoners brought to Ramah, in order to be transported to Babylon, which lay in the way to it; for Ramah was to the north of Jerusalem, as Babylon was: these chains were for the hands, or what we call handcuffs, as Kimchi, Abarbinel, and Ben Melech observe, and as appears from <a href="/jeremiah/40-4.htm">Jeremiah 40:4</a>. <p>(q) Comment in Hos. v. 8, <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/40.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, after that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah, when he had taken him being bound in chains among all that were carried away captive of Jerusalem and Judah, which were carried away captive unto Babylon.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/40.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">1</span>. <span class="ital">Ramah</span>] See on <a href="/jeremiah/31-15.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation, and bitter weeping; Rahel weeping for her children refused to be comforted for her children, because they were not.">Jeremiah 31:15</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/40.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-6.</span> - The liberation of Jeremiah. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The word that came to Jeremiah.</span> The formula seems to announce a prophecy; but no prophecy follows. It is not allowable to suppose, with Keil and others, that "the word" describes the entire body of prophetic utterance in ch. 40-45. (in spite of the fact that ch. 44. and 45. have special headings). The use would be unexampled; and a prologue of forty verses (see <a href="/jeremiah/42-7.htm">Jeremiah 42:7</a>) is equally contrary to prophetic analogy. Apparently the "word," or prophecy, which originally followed the heading has been lost or removed to some other place. <span class="cmt_word">Had let him go from Ramah.</span> Here is an apparent discrepancy with the account in <a href="/jeremiah/39-14.htm">Jeremiah 39:14</a>. The brevity of the latter seems to account for it. No doubt the more precise statement in our passage is to be followed. After the capture of the city, a number of captives, including Jeremiah, were probably conducted to Ramah (see on  <a href="/jeremiah/31-15.htm">Jeremiah 31:15</a>), where they had to wait for the royal decision as to their fate. Jeremiah, however, had already been in custody in the "court of the watch," and the writer of <a href="/jeremiah/29-14.htm">Jeremiah 29:14</a> simply omits the second stage of his captivity (Keil). <span class="cmt_word">In chains.</span> See ver. 4, "The chains which were upon thine hand." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/39.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Nebuchadnezzar gave orders regarding Jeremiah, through Nebuzaradan, the chief of the body-guards: "Take him, and set thine eyes upon him, and do him no harm; but, just as he telleth thee, so do with him." In obedience to this command, "Nebuzaradan, the chief of the body-guards, sent-and Nebushasban the head chamberlain, and Nergal-sharezer the chief magician, and all (the other) chief men of the king of Babylon-they sent and took Jeremiah out of the court of the prison, and delivered him over to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, to take him out to the house. Thus he dwelt among the people." - On the names of the Chaldean grandees, see on <a href="/jeremiah/39-3.htm">Jeremiah 39:3</a>. Instead of the chief chamberlain (&#1512;&#1489;&#1470;&#1505;&#1512;&#1497;&#1505;) Sarsechim, there is here named, as occupying this office, Nebushasban, who, it seems, along with Nebuzaradan, was not sent from Riblah till after the taking of Jerusalem, when Sarsechim was relieved.<p>We cannot come to any certain conclusion regarding the relation in which the two persons or names stand to one another, since Nebushasban is only mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-13.htm">Jeremiah 39:13</a>, just as Sarsechim is mentioned only in <a href="/jeremiah/39-3.htm">Jeremiah 39:3</a>. Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the man who had already on a former occasion given protection to Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/26-24.htm">Jeremiah 26:24</a>), was, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-5.htm">Jeremiah 40:5</a>, placed by the king of Babylon over the cities of Judah, i.e., was nominated the Chaldean governor over Judah and the Jews who were left in the land. To him, as such, Jeremiah is here (<a href="/jeremiah/39-14.htm">Jeremiah 39:14</a>) delivered, that he may take him into the house. &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; is neither the temple (Hitzig) nor the palace, the king's house (Graf), but the house in which Gedaliah resided as the governor; and we find here &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;, not &#1489;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1514;&#1493;, since the house was neither the property nor the permanent dwelling-place of Gedaliah. - According to this account, Jeremiah seems to have remained in the court of the prison till Nebuchadnezzar came, to have been liberated by Nebuzaradan only at the command of the king, and to have been sent to Gedaliah the governor. But this is contradicted by the account in <a href="/jeremiah/40-1.htm">Jeremiah 40:1</a>., according to which, Nebuzaradan liberated the prophet in Ramah, where he had been kept, confined by manacles, among the captives of Judah that were to be carried to Babylon: Nebuzaradan sent for him, and gave him his liberty. This contradiction has arisen simply from the intense brevity with which, in this verse, the fate of Jeremiah at the capture and destruction of Jerusalem is recorded; it is easy to settle the difference in this way: - When the city was taken, those inhabitants, especially males, who had not carried arms, were seized by the Chaldeans and carried out of the city to Ramah, where they were held prisoners till the decision of the king regarding their fate should be made known. Jeremiah shared this lot with his fellow-countrymen. When, after this, Nebuzaradan came to Jerusalem to execute the king's commands regarding the city and its inhabitants, at the special order of his monarch, he sent for Jeremiah the prophet, taking him out from among the crowd of prisoners who had been already carried away to Ramah, loosed him from his fetters, and gave him permission to choose his place of residence. This liberation of Jeremiah from his confinement might, in a summary account, be called a sending for him out of the court of the prison, even though the prophet, at the exact moment of his liberation, was no longer in the court of the prison of the palace at Jerusalem, but had been already carried away to Ramah as a captive. </body></html>
