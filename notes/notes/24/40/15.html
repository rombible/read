But how soon is this hopeful prospect blighted! When God begins a judgment, he will complete it. While pride, ambition, or revenge, bears rule in the heart, men will form new projects, and be restless in mischief, which commonly ends in their own ruin. Who would have thought, that after the destruction of Jerusalem, rebellion would so soon have sprung up? There can be no thorough change but what grace makes. And if the miserable, who are kept in everlasting chains for the judgment of the great day, were again permitted to come on earth, the sin and evil of their nature would be unchanged. Lord, give us new hearts, and that new mind in which the new birth consists, since thou hast said we cannot without it see thy heavenly kingdom.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/40.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>It is difficult to say what object Baalis can have had in murdering Gedaliah. As an ally of Zedekiah <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-3.htm">Jeremiah 27:3</a>, he may have had a spite against the family of Ahikam for opposing, as most probably they did at Jeremiah's instigation, the league proposed <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/27.htm">Jeremiah 27</a>.

These men, who had borne arms against the Chaldeans, were concerned for their safety when they returned into the country. Gedaliah sware to them, i.e., promised them on oath, "Be not afraid to serve the Chaldeans; remain in the country and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you. And as for me, behold, I shall remain at Mizpah to stand before the Chaldeans who will come to us," i.e., as lieutenant of the king of Babylon, to represent you before the Chaldean officers and armies, to maintain your rights and interests, so that you may be able to settle down where you choose, without anxiety, and cultivate the land. "And as for yourselves, father ye wine and fruit (&#1511;&#1497;&#1509;, see on <a href="/2_samuel/16-1.htm">2 Samuel 16:1</a>) and oil, and put them in your vessels." &#1488;&#1505;&#1507; is used of the ingathering of the fruits of the ground.

"And dwell in your cities, cities which ye seize," i.e., which you shall take possession of. <a href="/jeremiah/40-11.htm">Jeremiah 40:11</a>. Those Jews also who had fled, during the war, into the neighbouring countries of Moab, Ammon, Edom, etc., returned to Judah when they learned that the king of Babylon had left a remnant, and placed Gedaliah over them; they came to Mizpah and Gedaliah, who appointed them places to dwell in, and they gathered much wine and fruit, i.e., made a rich vintage and fruit harvest. &#1504;&#1514;&#1503; &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514;, "to give a remainder," as it were to leave a remainder ('&#1492;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1512; &#1513;&#1473;'( redniamer, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-7.htm">Jeremiah 44:7</a>, or '&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; &#1513;&#1473;, <a href="/genesis/45-7.htm">Genesis 45:7</a>). </body></html>
