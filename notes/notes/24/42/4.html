The thing these men promise is, that they would perfectly obey God’s will, whether agreeable or disagreeable to them.

In every difficult, doubtful case, we must look to God for direction; and we may still, in faith, pray to be guided by a spirit of wisdom in our hearts, and the leadings of Providence. We do not truly desire to know the mind of God, if we do not fully resolve to comply with it when we know it. Many promise to do what the Lord requires, while they hope to have their pride flattered, and their favourite lusts spared. Yet something betrays the state of their hearts.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/42.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Among those delivered by Johanan from Ishmael had been Jeremiah and Baruch <a href="/jeremiah/43-6.htm">Jeremiah 43:6</a>; and to them now all, without exception, come for counsel.<p>Jezaniah - He is called Azariah in <a href="/jeremiah/43-2.htm">Jeremiah 43:2</a>. The Septuagint, in both places, call him Azariah. Since there is little reason for identifying him with Jezaniah the Maachathite <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-8.htm">Jeremiah 40:8</a>, it is probable that the Septuagint is right in calling him in both places Azariah, and that the reading Jezaniah arose from some scribe assuming that his name must be found in the earlier list. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/42.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4.

Accordingly, Johanan and the other captains determined to withdraw to Egypt with the men, women, and children that had been carried off by Ishmael; these they conducted first to Bethlehem, where they encamped for the purpose of deliberating as to the rest of the journey, and taking due precautions. The account given in <a href="/jeremiah/41-16.htm">Jeremiah 41:16</a> is clumsily expressed, especially the middle portion, between "whom he had brought back" and "the son of Ahikam;" and in this part the words "from Mizpah" are particularly troublesome in breaking the connection: "whom he (Johanan) had brought back from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, from Mizpah, after he (Ishmael) had slain Gedaliah," while it is more correctly stated in the second relative clause, "whom he had brought back from Gibeon." Hitzig and Graf accordingly suppose that, originally, instead of  &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489; &#1502;&#1488;&#1514;, there stood in the text &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1492;, "whom he (Ishmael) had led captive from Mizpah, after he had slain Gedaliah." Thus the whole becomes clear. Against this conjecture there only stands the fact that the lxx translate &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#788;&#769;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768;  &#787;&#x399;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bb;; they must thus have read &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489; &#1502;&#1488;&#1514;, and omitted merely &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1510;&#1508;&#1468;&#1492; as unsuited to the passage. However, the error may be even older than the lxx, and &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489; &#1502;&#1488;&#1514; may easily have arisen through a scribe having glanced at the words &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489; of the last clause. The words from "men" to "chamberlains" form the more exact specification of the general expression "all the remnant of the people:" "men, viz., men of war, women (including the king's daughters, <a href="/jeremiah/40-10.htm">Jeremiah 40:10</a>), and children and chamberlains" (&#1505;&#1512;&#1497;&#1505;&#1497;&#1501;, guardians and servants of the female members of the royal family). </body></html>
