The word for “repent” does not imply regret for the past, as men repent of their sin, but, as in <a href="/jeremiah/18-8.htm" title="If that nation, against whom I have pronounced, turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do to them.">Jeremiah 18:8</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/26-3.htm" title="If so be they will listen, and turn every man from his evil way, that I may repent me of the evil, which I purpose to do to them because of the evil of their doings.">Jeremiah 26:3</a>, a change of purpose from what had been the mind of judgment to one of mercy. The prophet’s counsel is, as it had been all along, that the people should accept the punishment which God had inflicted on them, that they should stay where they were and as they were, and not in terror or suspicion seek safety in plans of their own devising.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/42.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>42:7-22 If we would know the mind of the Lord in doubtful cases, we must wait as well as pray. God is ever ready to return in mercy to those he has afflicted; and he never rejects any who rely on his promises. He has declared enough to silence even the causeless fears of his people, which discourge them in the way of duty. Whatever loss or suffering we may fear from obedience, is provided against in God's word; and he will protect and deliver all who trust in him and serve him. It is folly to quit our place, especially to quit a holy land, because we meet with trouble in it. And the evils we think to escape by sin, we certainly bring upon ourselves. We may apply this to the common troubles of life; and those who think to avoid them by changing their place, will find that the grievances common to men will meet them wherever they go. Sinners who dissemble with God in solemn professions especially should be rebuked with sharpness; for their actions speak more plainly than words. We know not what is good for ourselves; and what we are most fond of, and have our hearts most set upon, often proves hurtful, and sometimes fatal.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/42.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I repent me - As punishment had been inflicted, the divine justice was satisfied. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/42.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10.

The happiness and prosperity of people is in Scripture often set out under the notion of building and planting, as on the contrary their misery or destruction is expressed under the metaphorical notions of pulling down and plucking up. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">For I repent me of the evil that I have done unto you; </span> for I am satisfied with the punishment your nation hath undergone; and as to the remainder, if they do not destroy themselves by new disobedience, I will change the course of my providence. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/42.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>If ye will still abide in this land,.... In the land of Judea, their native country, where they had always lived, and where they continued when their brethren were carried captive; and yet they thought of going out of it, which the Lord knew; and therefore to encourage them to abide in it, and not think of departing into Egypt; that if they would take up their residence in it, and determine to continue there, he thus promises them: <p>then will I build you, and not pull you down: and I will plant you,  <p>and not pluck you up; that is, they should be firm and stable, happy and prosperous; and abound with all kind of blessings, and increase in numbers, wealth, and riches. The metaphors are taken from building houses, and planting fields and vineyards: <p>for I repent me of the evil that I have done unto you; not that he had done any unjust thing to them; or that he changed his mind concerning them; but that he had compassion on them, and would change his way and course of providence towards them, according to his unchangeable will. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/42.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">If ye will still abide in this land, then will I build you, and not pull <i>you</i> down, and I will plant you, and not pluck <i>you</i> up: for I <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> repent of the evil that I have done to you.</span><p>(d) See Geneva Jer 18:8</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/42.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">10</span>. <span class="ital">then will I build you, etc</span>.] Cp. <a href="/jeremiah/1-10.htm" title="See, I have this day set you over the nations and over the kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to throw down, to build, and to plant.">Jeremiah 1:10</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/24-6.htm" title="For I will set my eyes on them for good, and I will bring them again to this land: and I will build them, and not pull them down; and I will plant them, and not pluck them up.">Jeremiah 24:6</a> for these figures.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">I repent me</span>] an anthropomorphic figure.

The key to the discrepancy may be found in <a href="/psalms/18-25.htm">Psalm 18:25, 26</a>, "With the pious thou showest thyself pious... and with the froward thou showest thyself froward." There is no change in the nature or purpose of God, but only in his conduct towards man. The term "repent" is, therefore, only used analogically. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/42.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Jeremiah replies: "I have heard (i.e., acceded to your request); behold, I will pray to Jahveh your God, according to your words; and it shall come to pass that whatever Jahveh answers you I will tell you, I will not keep anything from you." <a href="/jeremiah/42-5.htm">Jeremiah 42:5</a>. They said further: "Let Jahveh be a true and faithful witness against us, if we do not just according to all the word which Jahveh thy God shall send thee (to declare) unto us. <a href="/jeremiah/42-6.htm">Jeremiah 42:6</a>. Whether it be good or bad, we shall obey the voice of Jahveh our God, to whom we send thee, that it may be well with us when we obey the voice of Jahveh our God." &#1506;&#1491;, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/14-25.htm">Proverbs 14:25</a>, and &#1504;&#1488;&#1502;&#1503;, <a href="/isaiah/8-2.htm">Isaiah 8:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/89-38.htm">Psalm 89:38</a>. Both predicates occupy emphatic positions. God is to be a faithful witness, not in regard to the truth of what they say, but as regards the fulfilment of their promise, so that, if they would not obey His word, He might come forward to punish them. &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495;&#1498; is construed with a double accusative: to send away a person with something, i.e., to give him a commission. After "whether it be good or evil," there is no need for supplying "in our eyes" (&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;), as Hitzig and Graf allege: "whether it please us or not;" the subject is &#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;: "we will obey the word, whether it be good or evil," i.e., whether it announce good or evil to come (cf. <a href="/ecclesiastes/12-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:14</a>). The Kethib &#1488;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; occurs only in this passage in the Old Testament; the Qeri accordingly substitutes &#1488;&#1504;&#1495;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;: the former, however, is taken from the vulgar tongue, and should not be altered here. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; does not mean "because we obey," but "when we obey." The hearing is the condition, not the cause of the prosperity. </body></html>
