God is ever ready to return in mercy to those he has afflicted; and he never rejects any who rely on his promises. He has declared enough to silence even the causeless fears of his people, which discourge them in the way of duty. Whatever loss or suffering we may fear from obedience, is provided against in God's word; and he will protect and deliver all who trust in him and serve him. It is folly to quit our place, especially to quit a holy land, because we meet with trouble in it. And the evils we think to escape by sin, we certainly bring upon ourselves. We may apply this to the common troubles of life; and those who think to avoid them by changing their place, will find that the grievances common to men will meet them wherever they go. Sinners who dissemble with God in solemn professions especially should be rebuked with sharpness; for their actions speak more plainly than words. We know not what is good for ourselves; and what we are most fond of, and have our hearts most set upon, often proves hurtful, and sometimes fatal.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/42.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I repent me - As punishment had been inflicted, the divine justice was satisfied. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/42.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10.

They said further: "Let Jahveh be a true and faithful witness against us, if we do not just according to all the word which Jahveh thy God shall send thee (to declare) unto us. <a href="/jeremiah/42-6.htm">Jeremiah 42:6</a>. Whether it be good or bad, we shall obey the voice of Jahveh our God, to whom we send thee, that it may be well with us when we obey the voice of Jahveh our God." &#1506;&#1491;, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/14-25.htm">Proverbs 14:25</a>, and &#1504;&#1488;&#1502;&#1503;, <a href="/isaiah/8-2.htm">Isaiah 8:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/89-38.htm">Psalm 89:38</a>. Both predicates occupy emphatic positions. God is to be a faithful witness, not in regard to the truth of what they say, but as regards the fulfilment of their promise, so that, if they would not obey His word, He might come forward to punish them. &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495;&#1498; is construed with a double accusative: to send away a person with something, i.e., to give him a commission. After "whether it be good or evil," there is no need for supplying "in our eyes" (&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;), as Hitzig and Graf allege: "whether it please us or not;" the subject is &#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;: "we will obey the word, whether it be good or evil," i.e., whether it announce good or evil to come (cf. <a href="/ecclesiastes/12-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:14</a>). The Kethib &#1488;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; occurs only in this passage in the Old Testament; the Qeri accordingly substitutes &#1488;&#1504;&#1495;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;: the former, however, is taken from the vulgar tongue, and should not be altered here. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; does not mean "because we obey," but "when we obey." The hearing is the condition, not the cause of the prosperity. </body></html>
