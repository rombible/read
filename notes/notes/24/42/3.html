In every difficult, doubtful case, we must look to God for direction; and we may still, in faith, pray to be guided by a spirit of wisdom in our hearts, and the leadings of Providence. We do not truly desire to know the mind of God, if we do not fully resolve to comply with it when we know it. Many promise to do what the Lord requires, while they hope to have their pride flattered, and their favourite lusts spared. Yet something betrays the state of their hearts.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/42.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Among those delivered by Johanan from Ishmael had been Jeremiah and Baruch <a href="/jeremiah/43-6.htm">Jeremiah 43:6</a>; and to them now all, without exception, come for counsel.<p>Jezaniah - He is called Azariah in <a href="/jeremiah/43-2.htm">Jeremiah 43:2</a>.

Since there is little reason for identifying him with Jezaniah the Maachathite <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-8.htm">Jeremiah 40:8</a>, it is probable that the Septuagint is right in calling him in both places Azariah, and that the reading Jezaniah arose from some scribe assuming that his name must be found in the earlier list. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/42.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. They consulted God, like many, not so much to know what was right, as wishing Him to authorize what they had already determined on, whether agreeable to His will or not.
