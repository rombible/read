Heshbon (the city is perhaps chosen on account of the similarity of sound with the word for “devise “) was on the Ammonite or northern frontier of Moab (<a href="/jeremiah/49-3.htm" title="Howl, O Heshbon, for Ai is spoiled: cry, you daughters of Rabbah, gird you with sackcloth; lament, and run to and fro by the hedges; for their king shall go into captivity, and his priests and his princes together.">Jeremiah 49:3</a>), and is represented therefore as the scene of the plans and hopes of the invading Chaldæans.

Here again there is an obvious assonance or paronomasia, the verb “thou shalt be cut down,” or better, <span class= "ital">thou shalt be brought to silence, </span>reproducing the chief consonants of the noun. The LXX., Vulgate, and Syriac, indeed, take the words with this meaning, “In silence thou shalt be made silent,” but are probably wrong in doing so.

Of this city See Gill on <a href="/isaiah/15-4.htm">Isaiah 15:4</a>; <p>they have devised evil against it; that is, the Chaldeans devised evil against Heshbon, to besiege it, take and destroy it: there is in the expression a beautiful allusion to the name of the city of Heshbon, which has its name from a word that signifies to devise and consult (c); <p>come, and let us cut it off from being a nation: this is what the Babylonians consulted together against Heshbon; and not only against that, a principal city; but against the whole country of Moab, to make such an entire desolation of it, that it should be no more a nation: that which the Moabites with others devised against the people of Israel is now devised against them; a just retaliation this; see <a href="/psalms/83-4.htm">Psalm 83:4</a>; <p>also thou shalt be cut down, O Madmen; or utterly destroyed: it may be rendered, "shall become silent" (d); the voice of man shall not be heard in it, especially the voice of praise, of boasting, and rejoicing: there is in this clause also an elegant allusion to the name of the place, which comes from a root that signifies to "cut down", or "be silent" (e). This is thought by Grotius to be the Madiama of Ptolemy (f): <p>the sword shall pursue thee; after it has destroyed other cities, it should come in great haste and with great force to Madmen; or it should pursue after the inhabitants, of it, that should make their escape, or attempt to do so.

Heshbon, one of the chief cities of Moab, lay to the N. E. of the Dead Sea, and was considered the N. boundary of Moab till Reuben, on entering Palestine, claimed the territory between it and the Arnon which enters the Dead Sea about the middle of its E. side. Of the cities assigned (<a href="/joshua/13-15.htm" title="And Moses gave to the tribe of the children of Reuben inheritance according to their families.">Joshua 13:15</a> ff.) to Reuben many are here mentioned as occupied by Moab. Hence the constant hostility between Moab and Israel (<a href="/judges/3-12.htm" title="And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD.">Jdg 3:12</a> ff.; <a href="/1_samuel/14-47.htm" title="So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines: and wherever he turned himself, he vexed them.">1 Samuel 14:47</a>, etc.).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">O Madmen, shalt be brought to silence</span>] Here again there is a play on the sound in the Hebrew which is, <span class="ital">Madmên, tiddômmi</span>.

How canst thou be quiet, when Jahveh hath commanded thee? Against Ashkelon and against the sea-coast, there hath He appointed it."<p>The address opens with a figure. The hostile army that is to devastate Philistia is represented as a stream of water, breaking forth from the north, and swelling to an overflowing winter-torrent, that inundates the country ad cities with their inhabitants. The figure is often used: cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-7.htm">Jeremiah 46:7-8</a>, where the Egyptian host is compared to the waves of the Nile; and <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/8-7.htm">Isaiah 8:7</a>, where the Assyrian army is likened to the floods of the Euphrates. The simile is applied here in another way. The figure is taken from a strong spring of water, coming forth in streams out of the ground, in the north, and swelling to an overflowing winter-torrent, that pours out its floods over Philistia, laying it waste. "From the north" is used here as in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-20.htm">Jeremiah 46:20</a>, and points back to <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-13.htm">Jeremiah 1:13-14</a>. "An inundating stream" is here employed as in <a href="/isaiah/30-20.htm">Isaiah 30:20</a>; "earth and its fulness, a city and those who dwell in it," as in <a href="/isaiah/8-16.htm">Isaiah 8:16</a>. In <a href="/jeremiah/47-3.htm">Jeremiah 47:3</a> follows the application of the figure. It is a martial host that overflows the land, and with its mighty noise puts the inhabitants in such terror that they think only of a hasty flight; even fathers do not turn back to save their children. &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1496;&#1492;&#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;., Syriac se&#8219;at&#803;, incedere, gradi, hence probably the stamping of hoofs. &#1488;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, strong horses, as in <a href="/jeremiah/8-16.htm">Jeremiah 8:16</a>. &#1500;&#1512;&#1499;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;, instead of the construct state, has perhaps been chosen only for the sake of introducing a variation; cf. Ewald, 290, a. &#1492;&#1508;&#1504;&#1492;, to turn the back, as in <a href="/jeremiah/46-5.htm">Jeremiah 46:5</a>. "Slackness of hands," i.e., utter loss of courage through terror; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/6-24.htm">Jeremiah 6:24</a> (the form &#1512;&#1508;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503; only occurs here). In <a href="/jeremiah/47-4.htm">Jeremiah 47:4</a> the deeper source of fear is mentioned; "because of the day," i.e., because the day has come to destroy all the Philistines, namely, the day of the judgment determined by the Lord; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/46-10.htm">Jeremiah 46:10</a>. "In order to destroy every remnant helping Tyre and Zidon." &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;&#1491; &#1506;&#1494;&#1512; are the Philistines, who could afford help to the Phoenicians in the struggle against the Chaldean power. This implies that the Phoenicians also shall perish without any one to help them. This indirect mention of the Phoenicians appears striking, but it is to be explained partly on the ground that Jeremiah has uttered special prophecies only against the chief enemies of Judah, and partly also perhaps from the historical relations, i.e., from the fact that the Philistines might have afforded help to the Phoenicians in the struggles against the great powers of the world. Hitzig unnecessarily seeks to take &#1500;&#1510;&#1512; &#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1510;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1503; as the object, and to expunge &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;&#1491; &#1506;&#1494;&#1512; as a gloss. The objections which he raises against the construction are groundless, as is shown by such passages as <a href="/jeremiah/44-7.htm">Jeremiah 44:7</a>; <a href="/isaiah/14-22.htm">Isaiah 14:22</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/14-10.htm">1 Kings 14:10</a>, etc. "The remaining helper" is the expression used, because the other nations that could help the Egyptians, viz., the Syrians and Phoenicians, had already succumbed to the Chaldean power. The destruction will be so great as this, because it is Jahveh who destroys the Philistines, the remnant of the coast of Caphtor. According to <a href="/amos/9-7.htm">Amos 9:7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-23.htm">Deuteronomy 2:23</a>, the Philistines came from Caphtor; hence &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; &#1488;&#1497; can only mean "what still remains of the people of Philistia who come from the coat of Caphtor," like "the remnant of the Philistines" in <a href="/amos/1-8.htm">Amos 1:8</a>. Opinions are divided as to Caphtor. The prevailing view is that of Lakemacher, that Caphtor is the name of the island of Crete; but for this there are no tenable grounds: see on <a href="/zephaniah/2-5.htm">Zephaniah 2:5</a>; and Delitzsch on Genesis, S. 248, Aufl. 4. Dietrich (in Merx' Archiv. i. S. 313ff.) and Ebers (Aegypten u. die Bcher Moses, i. S. 130ff.) agree in thinking that Caphtor is the shore of the Delta, but they explain the name differently. Dietrich derives it from the Egyptian Kah-pet-Ho&#770;r (district of Hor), which he takes to be the environs of the city of Buto, and the lake called after it (the modern Burlos), not far from the Sebennytic mouth of the Nile; Ebers, following the tablet of Canopus, in which the Egyptian name Kfa (Kaf) is given as that of Phoenicia, derives the name from Kaf-t-ur, i.e., the great Kefa, as the ancient seat of the Phoenicians on the shore of the Delta must have been called. But both explanations are still very doubtful, though there is no question about the migration of the Philistines from Egypt into Canaan. </body></html>
