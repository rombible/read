(See Notes there.) The relations between Moab and Israel had for a long period been more or less uneasy. The former had been tributary to the latter under Ahab, but on his death Mesha revolted, and a war ensued, which ended in the defeat of the Moabites by the allied forces of Israel, Judah, and Edom (2 Kings 3). They repeated their attack, however (<a href="/2_kings/13-20.htm" title="And Elisha died, and they buried him. And the bands of the Moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year.">2Kings 13:20</a>), and appear to have occupied the territory of the Trans-jordanic tribes on their deportation by Tiglath-pileser.

The article which is prefixed to it in the Hebrew has led Fürst (Lexicon) to take it in a wider sense, as meaning the plateau or highland country of Moab generally.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/48.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/jeremiah/48-1.htm" title="Against Moab thus said the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Woe to Nebo! for it is spoiled: Kiriathaim is confounded and taken: Misgab is confounded and dismayed.">Jeremiah 48:1</a></span>. <span class="ital">Against Moab </span>— Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">למואב</span>, <span class="ital">To, </span>or, <span class="ital">concerning Moab, thus saith the Lord of hosts — </span>This prophecy concerning the Moabites, as also the following which respect the Ammonites, Edomites, and other neighbouring nations, are supposed to have been fulfilled during the siege of Tyre by Nebuchadnezzar: see note on <a href="/jeremiah/47-1.htm" title="The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet against the Philistines, before that Pharaoh smote Gaza.">Jeremiah 47:1</a>. Many expressions and passages are found in this chapter which Jeremiah seems to have borrowed from a prophecy of Isaiah, chap. 15., and 16., concerning a like calamity which befell Moab, in all probability when Shalmaneser, king of Assyria, seized upon their cities and fortresses, and ravaged their country, on his march through it to invade the kingdom of Israel. By comparing the parallel places much light may be mutually thrown upon them. Kiriathaim, one of the cities of Moab, here mentioned, was given by Moses to the Reubenites, as appears by <a href="/joshua/13-10.htm" title="And all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, which reigned in Heshbon, to the border of the children of Ammon;">Joshua 13:10</a>, but the Moabites afterward recovered the possession of it.

Jeremiah in this prophecy uses that of Isa 15:1-16:14, amplifying and adapting it to his purpose under inspiration, at the same time confirming its divine authority. Isaiah, however, in his prophecy refers to the devastation of Moab by the Assyrian king, Shalmaneser; Jeremiah refers to that by Nebuchadnezzar.<p>1.

The prophecy concerning Moab is introduced with these epithets of God, partly to observe that the God of Israel was the only true God, in opposition to the gods of Moab, and other nations; and partly to point out his omnipotence, being able to perform what he here predicts and threatens; as also to suggest, that for the enmity of the Moabites to his people Israel, and their contempt of them, which is taken notice of in this chapter, and the ill treatment of them, the Lord would now take vengeance on them. Some render it, "concerning Moab" (z); because every thing that is here said is not against it; the chapter concludes in favour of it; though the far greater part, and ever, all but the last verse, is against it. This prophecy, according to Josephus (a), had its fulfilment about five years after the destruction of Jerusalem; <p>woe unto Nebo, for it is spoiled; its walls broken down; its houses demolished; its inhabitants destroyed, and plundered of their riches; this, in prophetic language, is represented as done, because of the certainty of it. Of this city See Gill on <a href="/isaiah/15-2.htm">Isaiah 15:2</a>; It is thought to be an oracular one, where was a temple of their idol; and from whence their priests gave out oracles, promising peace, and prosperity and safety, to Moab; and therefore the desolation of that is first prophesied of, to show that no dependence was to be had on those lying oracles; <p>Kirjathaim is confounded and taken; a city in the tribe of Reuben, which afterwards came into the hands of the Moabites, <a href="/joshua/13-19.htm">Joshua 13:19</a>. The word is of the dual form; and it might be a double city, like Jerusalem, consisting of a lower and upper city; or it might be divided by a river; or, as Kimchi and Ben Melech think, it was so called because it had two towers in it. It seems to be the same with Kir of Moab, Kirharesh, and Kirhareseth, <a href="/isaiah/15-1.htm">Isaiah 15:1</a>; when it was taken by the Chaldeans, the inhabitants were confounded, as having looked upon the place, and boasted of it, as impregnable; <p>Misgab is confounded and dismayed; so called from its being built on a high place, and well fortified; though some think that this is not the proper name of a place; but only signifies a high and fortified place both by nature and art; a place of refuge, where persons thought themselves safe; and so the Targum renders it, <p>"the house of their confidence;'' <p>this, when besieged and taken by the Babylonians, threw the inhabitants into the utmost consternation and confusion. Some take it to be the same with Bamoth, a name of much the same signification, <a href="/joshua/13-17.htm">Joshua 13:17</a>; see <a href="/isaiah/15-2.htm">Isaiah 15:2</a>. <p>(z) "ad Moab", V. L.

"An inundating stream" is here employed as in <a href="/isaiah/30-20.htm">Isaiah 30:20</a>; "earth and its fulness, a city and those who dwell in it," as in <a href="/isaiah/8-16.htm">Isaiah 8:16</a>. In <a href="/jeremiah/47-3.htm">Jeremiah 47:3</a> follows the application of the figure. It is a martial host that overflows the land, and with its mighty noise puts the inhabitants in such terror that they think only of a hasty flight; even fathers do not turn back to save their children. &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1496;&#1492;&#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;., Syriac se&#8219;at&#803;, incedere, gradi, hence probably the stamping of hoofs. &#1488;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, strong horses, as in <a href="/jeremiah/8-16.htm">Jeremiah 8:16</a>. &#1500;&#1512;&#1499;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;, instead of the construct state, has perhaps been chosen only for the sake of introducing a variation; cf. Ewald, 290, a. &#1492;&#1508;&#1504;&#1492;, to turn the back, as in <a href="/jeremiah/46-5.htm">Jeremiah 46:5</a>. "Slackness of hands," i.e., utter loss of courage through terror; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/6-24.htm">Jeremiah 6:24</a> (the form &#1512;&#1508;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503; only occurs here). In <a href="/jeremiah/47-4.htm">Jeremiah 47:4</a> the deeper source of fear is mentioned; "because of the day," i.e., because the day has come to destroy all the Philistines, namely, the day of the judgment determined by the Lord; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/46-10.htm">Jeremiah 46:10</a>. "In order to destroy every remnant helping Tyre and Zidon." &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;&#1491; &#1506;&#1494;&#1512; are the Philistines, who could afford help to the Phoenicians in the struggle against the Chaldean power. This implies that the Phoenicians also shall perish without any one to help them. This indirect mention of the Phoenicians appears striking, but it is to be explained partly on the ground that Jeremiah has uttered special prophecies only against the chief enemies of Judah, and partly also perhaps from the historical relations, i.e., from the fact that the Philistines might have afforded help to the Phoenicians in the struggles against the great powers of the world. Hitzig unnecessarily seeks to take &#1500;&#1510;&#1512; &#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1510;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1503; as the object, and to expunge &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;&#1491; &#1506;&#1494;&#1512; as a gloss. The objections which he raises against the construction are groundless, as is shown by such passages as <a href="/jeremiah/44-7.htm">Jeremiah 44:7</a>; <a href="/isaiah/14-22.htm">Isaiah 14:22</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/14-10.htm">1 Kings 14:10</a>, etc. "The remaining helper" is the expression used, because the other nations that could help the Egyptians, viz., the Syrians and Phoenicians, had already succumbed to the Chaldean power. The destruction will be so great as this, because it is Jahveh who destroys the Philistines, the remnant of the coast of Caphtor. According to <a href="/amos/9-7.htm">Amos 9:7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-23.htm">Deuteronomy 2:23</a>, the Philistines came from Caphtor; hence &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; &#1488;&#1497; can only mean "what still remains of the people of Philistia who come from the coat of Caphtor," like "the remnant of the Philistines" in <a href="/amos/1-8.htm">Amos 1:8</a>. Opinions are divided as to Caphtor. The prevailing view is that of Lakemacher, that Caphtor is the name of the island of Crete; but for this there are no tenable grounds: see on <a href="/zephaniah/2-5.htm">Zephaniah 2:5</a>; and Delitzsch on Genesis, S. 248, Aufl. 4. Dietrich (in Merx' Archiv. i. S. 313ff.) and Ebers (Aegypten u. die Bcher Moses, i. S. 130ff.) agree in thinking that Caphtor is the shore of the Delta, but they explain the name differently. Dietrich derives it from the Egyptian Kah-pet-Ho&#770;r (district of Hor), which he takes to be the environs of the city of Buto, and the lake called after it (the modern Burlos), not far from the Sebennytic mouth of the Nile; Ebers, following the tablet of Canopus, in which the Egyptian name Kfa (Kaf) is given as that of Phoenicia, derives the name from Kaf-t-ur, i.e., the great Kefa, as the ancient seat of the Phoenicians on the shore of the Delta must have been called. But both explanations are still very doubtful, though there is no question about the migration of the Philistines from Egypt into Canaan. </body></html>
