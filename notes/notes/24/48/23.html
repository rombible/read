The destruction of Moab is further prophesied, to awaken them by national repentance and reformation to prevent the trouble, or by a personal repentance and reformation to prepare for it. In reading this long roll of threatenings, and mediating on the terror, it will be of more use to us to keep in view the power of God's anger and the terror of his judgments, and to have our hearts possessed with a holy awe of God and of his wrath, than to search into all the figures and expressions here used. Yet it is not perpetual destruction. The chapter ends with a promise of their return out of captivity in the latter days. Even with Moabites God will not contend for ever, nor be always wroth. The Jews refer it to the days of the Messiah; then the captives of the Gentiles, under the yoke of sin and Satan, shall be brought back by Divine grace, which shall make them free indeed.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/48.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Beth-meon - Meon is probably the Moabite Olympus, and thus Beth-Baal-Meon, the full name of this town <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/13-17.htm">Joshua 13:17</a>, would signify the place where the heavenly Baal was worshipped. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/48.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>23.

The summons to lament, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-17.htm">Jeremiah 48:17</a>, is not a mockery, but is seriously meant, for the purpose of expressing the idea that the downfall of so mighty and glorious a power will rouse compassion. The environs of Moab are the neighbouring nations, and "those who know his name" are those who live far off, and have only heard about him. The staff, the sceptre, is the emblem of authority; cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/19-11.htm">Ezekiel 19:11-12</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/19-14.htm">Ezekiel 19:14</a>, and <a href="/psalms/110-2.htm">Psalm 110:2</a>. </body></html>
