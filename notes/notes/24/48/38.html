The destruction of Moab is further prophesied, to awaken them by national repentance and reformation to prevent the trouble, or by a personal repentance and reformation to prepare for it. In reading this long roll of threatenings, and mediating on the terror, it will be of more use to us to keep in view the power of God's anger and the terror of his judgments, and to have our hearts possessed with a holy awe of God and of his wrath, than to search into all the figures and expressions here used. Yet it is not perpetual destruction. The chapter ends with a promise of their return out of captivity in the latter days. Even with Moabites God will not contend for ever, nor be always wroth. The Jews refer it to the days of the Messiah; then the captives of the Gentiles, under the yoke of sin and Satan, shall be brought back by Divine grace, which shall make them free indeed.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/48.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Generally - Rather, entirely. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/48.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>38. vessel &#8230; no pleasure&#8212;(See on [986]Jer 22:28); a vessel cast aside by the potter as refuse, not answering his design.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/48.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> We met with the same phrase applied to Coniah, <span class="bld"><a href="/jeremiah/22-28.htm" title="Is this man Coniah a despised broken idol? is he a vessel wherein is no pleasure? why are they cast out, he and his seed, and are cast into a land which they know not?">Jeremiah 22:28</a></span>.

However, the former interpretation is the more obvious, and is confirmed by the reading in <a href="/isaiah/16-9.htm">Isaiah 16:9</a>. According to the Onomasticon, Jazer was fifteen Roman miles north from Heshbon. Seetzen recognises it in the ruins called es Szir at the source of the Nahr Szir; see on <a href="/numbers/21-32.htm">Numbers 21:32</a>. According to Jerome, on <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/16-8.htm">Isaiah 16:8</a>, Sibmah was only five hundred paces from Heshbon; see on <a href="/numbers/32-38.htm">Numbers 32:38</a>. Judging from the verse now before us, and from Isa. l.c., the vines of Sibmah must have been famed for the strength and excellence of their clusters. Even now, that region produces excellent grapes in abundance. From Szalt, which lies only ten miles north from Szir, raisins and grapes are carried to Jerusalem, and these of excellent quality (Seetzen, i. S. 399; Burckhardt, p. 350). In what follows, "his tendrils crossed the sea," etc., the extensive cultivation of the grape is set forth under the figure of a vine whose tendrils stretch out on all sides. "They have crossed over the sea" has reference in Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/16-8.htm">Isaiah 16:8</a>) to the Dead Sea (&#1497;&#1501;, as in <a href="/psalms/68-23.htm">Psalm 68:23</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/20-2.htm">2 Chronicles 20:2</a>); not merely, however, in the sense of the shoots reaching close to the Dead Sea, but also over it, for Engedi was famed for its vines (Sol 1:14). Jeremiah also has reproduced the words taken from Isaiah in this sense. From the following clause, "they reached to the sea of Jazer," it does not follow that he has specified "the sea" by "Jazer." What tells rather the other way is the fact that &#1506;&#1489;&#1512;, which means to cross over, cannot possibly be used as equivalent to &#1504;&#1490;&#1506; &#1506;&#1491;, "to reach to." "They crossed over the sea" shows extension towards the west, while "they reached to the sea of Jazer" indicates extension towards the north. This latter statement also is an imitation of what we find in <a href="/isaiah/16-8.htm">Isaiah 16:8</a>; and "Jazer" is merely further specified as "the sea of Jazer." In spite of the most diligent inquiries, Seetzen (i. S. 406) could learn nothing from the people of that region regarding an inland lake; but in the beautiful green vale in the vicinity of Szr (i.e., Jazer) there were several ponds, which he supposes may possibly be the mare Jazer, since this valley lying among the mountains is somewhat depressed, and in ancient times was probably filled with water. The "sea" (&#1497;&#1501;) of Solomon's temple further shows that &#1497;&#1501; does not necessarily denote only a large lake, but might also be applied to a large artificial basin of water. So also, at the present day, the artificial water-basins on the streets of Damascus are called baharat, "seas;" cf. Wetzstein in Delitzsch on <a href="/isaiah/16-8.htm">Isaiah 16:8</a>. This cultivation of the vine is at an end; for the destroyer has fallen upon the fruit-harvest and the vintage. Jeremiah, by "the destroyer has fallen," explains the words of Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/16-9.htm">Isaiah 16:9</a>), "shouting has fallen." - In <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-33.htm">Jeremiah 48:33</a>, <a href="/isaiah/16-10.htm">Isaiah 16:10</a> is reproduced. "Joy and gladness are taken away from the gardens, and from the whole land of Moab." &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1502;&#1500; is not here a proper name, for Mount Carmel does not at all suit the present context; it is an appellative, fruit-land, i.e., the fruitful wine-country near Jazer. Jeremiah adds, "and from the land (i.e., the whole land) of Moab." The pressing of the grapes comes to an end; there is no wine in the vat; no longer is the wine pressed with "Hedad." &#1492;&#1497;&#1491;&#1491; is an adverbial accusative. This is further specified by the oxymoron: a "Hedad, and yet not a Hedad." This word generally signifies any loud shout, - not merely the shout of the wine-pressers as they tread the grapes (see on <a href="/jeremiah/25-30.htm">Jeremiah 25:30</a>), but also a battle-cry; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/51-14.htm">Jeremiah 51:14</a>. Hence the meaning is, "Hedad is heard, but not a merry shout of the wine-pressers." </body></html>
