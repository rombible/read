The destruction of Moab is further prophesied, to awaken them by national repentance and reformation to prevent the trouble, or by a personal repentance and reformation to prepare for it. In reading this long roll of threatenings, and mediating on the terror, it will be of more use to us to keep in view the power of God's anger and the terror of his judgments, and to have our hearts possessed with a holy awe of God and of his wrath, than to search into all the figures and expressions here used. Yet it is not perpetual destruction. The chapter ends with a promise of their return out of captivity in the latter days. Even with Moabites God will not contend for ever, nor be always wroth. The Jews refer it to the days of the Messiah; then the captives of the Gentiles, under the yoke of sin and Satan, shall be brought back by Divine grace, which shall make them free indeed.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/48.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Aroer - On the Arnon, due south of Dibon.

Aroer&#8212;on the north bank of the Arnon, a city of Ammon (De 2:36; 3:12). As it was on "the way" of the Moabites who fled into the desert, its inhabitants "ask" what is the occasion of Moab's flight, and so learn the lot that awaits themselves (compare 1Sa 4:13, 16).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/48.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Aroer</span> was a city in the lot of Gad and Reuben, <span class="bld"><a href="/numbers/32-34.htm" title="And the children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,">Numbers 32:34</a></span>.

The Aroer of the text was a few miles S.W. of Dibon. Mesha records on the “Moabite stone” that he “built (i.e. restored) the city and made the road over the Arnon.”<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/48.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - The inhabitants of <span class="cmt_word">Aroer</span> will come out in eager expectation to meet the fugitives, and ask, <span class="cmt_word">What hath happened?</span> (so the question should be rendered). There were several Aroers (one belonged to the Ammonites, <a href="/joshua/13-25.htm">Joshua 13:25</a>), but as the enemy is driving the Moabites southward, the Aroer here intended can only be the town by the Arnon, which separated Moab proper first of all from the kingdom of the Amorites (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-48.htm">Deuteronomy 4:48</a>; <a href="/joshua/12-2.htm">Joshua 12:2</a>), and afterwards from the territory of the Israelites (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-36.htm">Deuteronomy 2:36</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/3-12.htm">Deuteronomy 3:12</a>). The picture drawn in this verse is singularly appropriate to the site of Arnon, "just by the edge of the arterial highway of Moab," and commanding a complete view of the pass of the Arnon (Tristram, 'Land of Moab,' p. 132). There is the same variety of statement as to the Israetitish tribe to which Aroer belonged as in the case of Dibon (see ver. 18). <a href="/joshua/13-16.htm">Joshua 13:16</a> speaks in favour of Reuben; <a href="/numbers/32-34.htm">Numbers 32:34</a> in favour of Gad. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/48.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In this way Moab will come to dishonour through his god Chemosh, i.e., experience his powerlessness and nothingness, and perish with him, just as Israel (the ten tribes) came to dishonour through Bethel, i.e., through their golden calf at Bethel. As to the form &#1502;&#1489;&#1496;&#1495;&#1501;, with Segol in the pretone, cf. Ewald, 70, a; Olshausen, Gram. S. 377. Moab will then be no longer able to boast of his valour; this is the meaning of the question in <a href="/jeremiah/48-14.htm">Jeremiah 48:14</a> : on this term in the address, cf. <a href="/jeremiah/2-23.htm">Jeremiah 2:23</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/8-8.htm">Jeremiah 8:8</a>. In <a href="/jeremiah/48-15.htm">Jeremiah 48:15</a> it is further stated that the result will show this: "Moab is laid waste." &#1493;&#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492; &#1506;&#1500;&#1492; is variously interpreted. An explanation which has met with much acceptance, but which nevertheless is really untenable, is founded on <a href="/judges/20-40.htm">Judges 20:40</a> ("The whole city went up towards heaven" i.e., in smoke and fire): "As for his cities, fire or smoke ascends;" but there is no mention here either of smoke or fire. Kimchi long ago came near the truth when he sought to find the subject &#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1491; in shudad &#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1468;&#1491;: "and the devastator comes against his cities." However, the contrast between &#1506;&#1500;&#1492; and &#1497;&#1512;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468; is not fully brought out in this way: it is better to leave the subject indeterminate: "and his cities they climb" (Kueper), or: "they go up to his cities" (Bttcher, Neue Aehrenlese, ii. 163). The enemy who mounts the cities is evidently intended. The change &#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1468;&#1491; into &#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1491; is both unnecessary and unsuitable; but J. D. Michaelis, Ewald, Dahler, Graf, after making the alteration, translate, "The destroyer of Moab and of his cities draws near." Hitzig justly remarks, in opposition to this conjecture: "There is nothing to justify the mere placing of the subject at the head of the sentence (contrast <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-8.htm">Jeremiah 48:8</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/48-18.htm">Jeremiah 48:18</a>); besides, one does not see why the cities of Moab are distinguished from Moab itself; and cf. 20b." &#1497;&#1512;&#1491; &#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1496;&#1495;, "to sink down to the slaughter," cf. <a href="/jeremiah/50-27.htm">Jeremiah 50:27</a>; and on this use of &#1497;&#1512;&#1491;, <a href="/isaiah/34-7.htm">Isaiah 34:7</a>. The enemy ascends into the cities, the young soldiers of Moab descend to the shambles. This threatening is enforced by the addition, "saith the King," etc. Jahveh is called the King, in contrast with the belief of the Moabites, that their god Chemosh was the king of his people (see on <a href="/jeremiah/48-7.htm">Jeremiah 48:7</a>). The true King of the Moabites also is Jahveh, the God of hosts, i.e., the Ruler of the whole world. </body></html>
