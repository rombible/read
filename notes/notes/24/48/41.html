The destruction of Moab is further prophesied, to awaken them by national repentance and reformation to prevent the trouble, or by a personal repentance and reformation to prepare for it. In reading this long roll of threatenings, and mediating on the terror, it will be of more use to us to keep in view the power of God's anger and the terror of his judgments, and to have our hearts possessed with a holy awe of God and of his wrath, than to search into all the figures and expressions here used. Yet it is not perpetual destruction. The chapter ends with a promise of their return out of captivity in the latter days. Even with Moabites God will not contend for ever, nor be always wroth. The Jews refer it to the days of the Messiah; then the captives of the Gentiles, under the yoke of sin and Satan, shall be brought back by Divine grace, which shall make them free indeed.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/48.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Surprised - captured by force. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/48.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>41. as &#8230; woman in &#8230; pangs&#8212;(Isa 13:8).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/48.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Whether <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Kerioth</span> here be the proper name of a city, as it is <span class="bld"><a href="/jeremiah/48-24.htm" title="And on Kerioth, and on Bozrah, and on all the cities of the land of Moab, far or near.">Jeremiah 48:24</a></span>, or an appellative noun signifying cities, is doubtful.
