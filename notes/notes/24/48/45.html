Heshbon, at the time of the Exodus the capital of the Amorites, is here identified with Sihon as their king. In the prophet’s application of the words, the Moabites are represented as taking refuge under the walls of Heshbon, but, instead of finding shelter, fire bursts out from walls and gates. They have come to look on its conflagration. The flames spread far and near. They devour the “corner” as of the beard, the hair on the crown of the head. The symbolism of destruction is the same as in <a href="/isaiah/7-20.htm" title="In the same day shall the Lord shave with a razor that is hired, namely, by them beyond the river, by the king of Assyria, the head, and the hair of the feet: and it shall also consume the beard.">Isaiah 7:20</a>. In the “tumultuous ones” (literally, <span class= "ital">children of tumult</span>) we have the panic-stricken clamorous crowds of the Moabite fugitives. The phrase in the Hebrew is nearly the same as “the children of Seth” in <a href="/numbers/24-17.htm" title="I shall see him, but not now: I shall behold him, but not near: there shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Scepter shall rise out of Israel, and shall smite the corners of Moab, and destroy all the children of Sheth.">Numbers 24:17</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/48.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/jeremiah/48-45.htm" title="They that fled stood under the shadow of Heshbon because of the force: but a fire shall come forth out of Heshbon, and a flame from the middle of Sihon, and shall devour the corner of Moab, and the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones....">Jeremiah 48:45-46</a></span>. <span class="ital">They that fled stood under the shadow of Heshbon, </span>&c. — They that fled for fear of the enemies’ forces thought to find shelter and safety in Heshbon, a strong fenced city.

When the enemies have possessed themselves of Heshbon, they will quickly spread like fire over the rest of the country. Thus the prophet fitly applies to the present case the words of an ancient poem made upon Sihon’s conquests over Moab, and recited by Moses, <a href="/context/numbers/21-27.htm" title="Why they that speak in proverbs say, Come into Heshbon, let the city of Sihon be built and prepared:...">Numbers 21:27-28</a>, where see the notes. <span class="ital">And shall devour the corner of Moab, and the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones </span>— By the <span class="ital">corner </span>may be meant the borders, or extreme parts of the country.

The destruction of Moab is further prophesied, to awaken them by national repentance and reformation to prevent the trouble, or by a personal repentance and reformation to prepare for it. In reading this long roll of threatenings, and mediating on the terror, it will be of more use to us to keep in view the power of God's anger and the terror of his judgments, and to have our hearts possessed with a holy awe of God and of his wrath, than to search into all the figures and expressions here used. Yet it is not perpetual destruction. The chapter ends with a promise of their return out of captivity in the latter days. Even with Moabites God will not contend for ever, nor be always wroth. The Jews refer it to the days of the Messiah; then the captives of the Gentiles, under the yoke of sin and Satan, shall be brought back by Divine grace, which shall make them free indeed.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/48.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Because of the force - Rather, without force.

It is simpler to take both forms as perfects: "they howl...Moab turns the back, is ashamed" ( equals  for shame). On &#1492;&#1497;&#1492; &#1500;&#1513;&#1474;&#1495;&#1511;, cf. <a href="/jeremiah/48-26.htm">Jeremiah 48:26</a>. &#1502;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;, object of terror, as in <a href="/jeremiah/17-17.htm">Jeremiah 17:17</a>. "All who are round about him," as in <a href="/jeremiah/48-17.htm">Jeremiah 48:17</a>. "For (<a href="/jeremiah/48-40.htm">Jeremiah 48:40</a>) the enemy rushes down upon Moab like an eagle, and seizes Kerioth and all his strongholds." The subject is left unnamed, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-18.htm">Jeremiah 46:18</a>, but it is Nebuchadnezzar. The figure of the eagle, darting down in flight on its prey, is founded on <a href="/deuteronomy/28-49.htm">Deuteronomy 28:49</a> (on &#1488;&#1500;- for &#1506;&#1500;, cf. <a href="/jeremiah/49-22.htm">Jeremiah 49:22</a>). Kerioth, the capital, is taken (see on <a href="/jeremiah/48-24.htm">Jeremiah 48:24</a>); so are the other strongholds or fastnesses of the country. The mere fact that &#1511;&#1512;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; has the article does not justify any one in taking it as an appellative, "the cities;" this appears from a comparison of <a href="/amos/2-2.htm">Amos 2:2</a> with this verse. No plural of &#1511;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492; occurs anywhere. Then the fear of death falls on the heroes of Moab like a woman in labour. &#1502;&#1510;&#1512;&#1492;, partic. Hiphil from &#1510;&#1512;&#1512;, uterum comprimens, is found only here and in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-22.htm">Jeremiah 49:22</a>, where the figure is repeated. Moab is annihilated, so that it is no longer a nation (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/48-2.htm">Jeremiah 48:2</a>), because it has risen up in pride against the God of Israel; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/48-26.htm">Jeremiah 48:26</a>. He who flees from one danger falls into the other. The play on the words &#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1491;, fear, horror, &#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;, pit, and &#1508;&#1468;&#1495;, spring-trap, as well as the mode in which it is carried out, is taken from <a href="/isaiah/24-17.htm">Isaiah 24:17</a>., - a prophecy of the judgment on the world; see a similar idea presented in <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/5-19.htm">Amos 5:19</a>, but somewhat differently expressed. The Kethib &#1492;&#1504;&#1497;&#1505;, perfect Hiphil, "he flees," is less suitable than the Qeri &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1505; (after Isaiah). The last clause, "for I will bring," etc., is quite in Jeremiah's peculiar style; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/4-23.htm">Jeremiah 4:23</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/23-12.htm">Jeremiah 23:12</a>. &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492; belongs to &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1502;&#1493;&#1488;&#1489;: the noun is anticipated by the pronoun, as frequently occurs; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/9-14.htm">Jeremiah 9:14</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/41-3.htm">Jeremiah 41:3</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/43-11.htm">Jeremiah 43:11</a>. </body></html>
