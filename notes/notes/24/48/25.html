The destruction of Moab is further prophesied, to awaken them by national repentance and reformation to prevent the trouble, or by a personal repentance and reformation to prepare for it. In reading this long roll of threatenings, and mediating on the terror, it will be of more use to us to keep in view the power of God's anger and the terror of his judgments, and to have our hearts possessed with a holy awe of God and of his wrath, than to search into all the figures and expressions here used. Yet it is not perpetual destruction. The chapter ends with a promise of their return out of captivity in the latter days. Even with Moabites God will not contend for ever, nor be always wroth. The Jews refer it to the days of the Messiah; then the captives of the Gentiles, under the yoke of sin and Satan, shall be brought back by Divine grace, which shall make them free indeed.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/48.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The horn - i. e., his pride (marginal reference); his arm, i. e., his strength <a href="/jeremiah/17-5.htm">Jeremiah 17:5</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/48.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>25. horn&#8212;the emblem of strength and sovereignty: it is the horned animal's means of offense and defense (Ps 75:5, 10; La 2:3).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/48.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> That is, the beauty and the <span class="ital">strength of Moab</span>. So these two terms often signify in holy writ, the horn being much the beauty of some beasts, and that part of their bodies by which they both do injury to others, and defend themselves from the assaults of others. God here declares that Moab should both lose its glory and beauty, and also all the power it formerly had to defend itself, or offend others. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/48.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>The horn of Moab is cut off,....

The inhabitants if Dibon are to come down from their glory and sit in misery; those of Aroer are to ask the fugitives what has happened, that they may learn that the whole table-land on to the Arnon has been taken by the enemy; and they are to howl over the calamity. The idea presented in <a href="/jeremiah/48-18.htm">Jeremiah 48:18</a> is an imitation of that in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/47-1.htm">Isaiah 47:1</a>, "Come down, O daughter of Babylon, sit in the dust;" but &#1512;&#1491;&#1497; is intensified by the addition of &#1502;&#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491;, and &#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1497; &#1506;&#1500; is changed into  &#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1497; &#1489;&#1510;&#1468;&#1502;&#1488; (the Kethib &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1497; has evidently been written by mistake for &#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1497;, the Qeri). &#1510;&#1502;&#1488; elsewhere means "thirst;" but "sit down in the thirst" would be too strange an expression; hence &#1510;&#1502;&#1488; must here have the meaning of  &#1510;&#1502;&#1488;, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/44-3.htm">Isaiah 44:3</a>, "the thirsty arid land:" thus it remains a question whether we should point the word &#1510;&#1502;&#1488;, or take &#1510;&#1502;&#1488; as another form of &#1510;&#1502;&#1488;, as &#1495;&#1500;&#1489; sa ,&#1510;&#1502;&#1488; fo mro is of &#1495;&#1500;&#1489;, <a href="/ezekiel/23-19.htm">Ezekiel 23:19</a>. There is no sufficient reason why Hitzig and Ewald should give the word a meaning foreign to it, from the Arabic or Syriac. Dibon lay about four miles north from the Arnon, at the foot of a mountain, in a very beautiful plain, where, under the name of Dibn, many traces of walls, and a well by the wayside, hewn out of the rock, are still to be found (Seetzen, i. S. 409f.). Hence it must have been well provided with water, even though we should be obliged to understand by "the water of Dimon" (Dibon), which Isaiah mentions (<a href="/isaiah/15-9.htm">Isaiah 15:9</a>), the river Arnon, which is about three miles off. The command to "sit down in an arid land" thus forms a suitable figure, representing the humiliation and devastation of Dibon. That the city was fortified, is evident from the mention of the fortifications in the last clause. &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1514; , as in <a href="/jeremiah/46-19.htm">Jeremiah 46:19</a>. Aroer was situated on the north bank of the Arnon (Mojeb), where its ruins still remain, under the old name Ar&#1490;'ir (Burckhardt, p. 372). It was a frontier town, between the kingdom of Sihon (afterwards the territory of the Israelites) and the possession of the Moabites (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-36.htm">Deuteronomy 2:36</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/3-12.htm">Deuteronomy 3:12</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/4-48.htm">Deuteronomy 4:48</a>; <a href="/joshua/12-2.htm">Joshua 12:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/13-9.htm">Joshua 13:9</a>, <a href="/joshua/13-16.htm">Joshua 13:16</a>). But after the Moabites had regained the northern portion of their original territory, it lay in the midst of the land. The fugitives here represented as passing by are endeavouring, by crossing the Arnon, to escape from the enemy advancing from the north, and subduing the country before them. &#1504;&#1505; &#1493;&#1504;&#1502;&#1500;&#1496;&#1492; means fugitives of every kind. The co-ordination of the same word or synonymous terms in the masc. and fem. serves to generalize the idea; see on <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/3-1.htm">Isaiah 3:1</a>, and Ewald, 172, c. In &#1504;&#1502;&#1500;&#1496;&#1492;  the tone is retracted through the influence of the distinctive accent; the form is participial. The question, "What has happened?" is answered in <a href="/jeremiah/48-20.htm">Jeremiah 48:20</a>. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;, "for ( equals  certainly) it is broken down." The Kethib &#1492;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497; &#1493;&#1468;&#1494;&#1506;&#1511;&#1497; must not be changed. Moab is addressed: with &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468; is introduced the summons, addressed to individuals, to proclaim at the Arnon the calamity that has befallen the country to the north of that river. </body></html>
