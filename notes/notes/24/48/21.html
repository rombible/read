The destruction of Moab is further prophesied, to awaken them by national repentance and reformation to prevent the trouble, or by a personal repentance and reformation to prepare for it. In reading this long roll of threatenings, and mediating on the terror, it will be of more use to us to keep in view the power of God's anger and the terror of his judgments, and to have our hearts possessed with a holy awe of God and of his wrath, than to search into all the figures and expressions here used. Yet it is not perpetual destruction. The chapter ends with a promise of their return out of captivity in the latter days. Even with Moabites God will not contend for ever, nor be always wroth. The Jews refer it to the days of the Messiah; then the captives of the Gentiles, under the yoke of sin and Satan, shall be brought back by Divine grace, which shall make them free indeed.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/48.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Holon - This place apparently took its name from caverns in its neighborhood. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/48.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21. plain&#8212;(Jer 48:8).

Like Heshbon and Dibon, it was claimed by the Reubenites (<a href="/joshua/13-18.htm">Joshua 13:18</a>), and Mesha, in the famous inscription, states that the then King of Israel (Jehoram) "fortified Jahaz and dwelt in it, when he fought against me" (lines 18, 19). This was a great but only a temporary success, for Mesha adds that "Chemosh drove him out before me" (line 19). <span class="cmt_word">Mephaath</span> was apparently near Jahaz, since it is always mentioned with that town (<a href="/joshua/13-18.htm">Joshua 13:18</a>; <a href="/joshua/21-37.htm">Joshua 21:37</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/6-79.htm">1 Chronicles 6:79</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/48.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In this way Moab will come to dishonour through his god Chemosh, i.e., experience his powerlessness and nothingness, and perish with him, just as Israel (the ten tribes) came to dishonour through Bethel, i.e., through their golden calf at Bethel. As to the form &#1502;&#1489;&#1496;&#1495;&#1501;, with Segol in the pretone, cf. Ewald, 70, a; Olshausen, Gram. S. 377. Moab will then be no longer able to boast of his valour; this is the meaning of the question in <a href="/jeremiah/48-14.htm">Jeremiah 48:14</a> : on this term in the address, cf. <a href="/jeremiah/2-23.htm">Jeremiah 2:23</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/8-8.htm">Jeremiah 8:8</a>. In <a href="/jeremiah/48-15.htm">Jeremiah 48:15</a> it is further stated that the result will show this: "Moab is laid waste." &#1493;&#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492; &#1506;&#1500;&#1492; is variously interpreted. An explanation which has met with much acceptance, but which nevertheless is really untenable, is founded on <a href="/judges/20-40.htm">Judges 20:40</a> ("The whole city went up towards heaven" i.e., in smoke and fire): "As for his cities, fire or smoke ascends;" but there is no mention here either of smoke or fire. Kimchi long ago came near the truth when he sought to find the subject &#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1491; in shudad &#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1468;&#1491;: "and the devastator comes against his cities." However, the contrast between &#1506;&#1500;&#1492; and &#1497;&#1512;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468; is not fully brought out in this way: it is better to leave the subject indeterminate: "and his cities they climb" (Kueper), or: "they go up to his cities" (Bttcher, Neue Aehrenlese, ii. 163). The enemy who mounts the cities is evidently intended. The change &#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1468;&#1491; into &#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1491; is both unnecessary and unsuitable; but J. D. Michaelis, Ewald, Dahler, Graf, after making the alteration, translate, "The destroyer of Moab and of his cities draws near." Hitzig justly remarks, in opposition to this conjecture: "There is nothing to justify the mere placing of the subject at the head of the sentence (contrast <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-8.htm">Jeremiah 48:8</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/48-18.htm">Jeremiah 48:18</a>); besides, one does not see why the cities of Moab are distinguished from Moab itself; and cf. 20b." &#1497;&#1512;&#1491; &#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1496;&#1495;, "to sink down to the slaughter," cf. <a href="/jeremiah/50-27.htm">Jeremiah 50:27</a>; and on this use of &#1497;&#1512;&#1491;, <a href="/isaiah/34-7.htm">Isaiah 34:7</a>. The enemy ascends into the cities, the young soldiers of Moab descend to the shambles. This threatening is enforced by the addition, "saith the King," etc. Jahveh is called the King, in contrast with the belief of the Moabites, that their god Chemosh was the king of his people (see on <a href="/jeremiah/48-7.htm">Jeremiah 48:7</a>). The true King of the Moabites also is Jahveh, the God of hosts, i.e., the Ruler of the whole world. </body></html>
