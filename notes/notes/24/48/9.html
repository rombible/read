We should be thankful that we are required to seek the salvation of men's lives, and the salvation of their souls, not to shed their blood; but we shall be the more without excuse if we do this pleasant work deceitfully. The cities shall be laid in ruins, and the country shall be wasted. There will be great sorrow. There will be great hurry. If any could give wings to sinners, still they could not fly out of the reach of Divine indignation. There are many who persist in unrepented iniquity, yet long enjoy outward prosperity. They had been long corrupt and unreformed, secure and sensual in prosperity. They have no changes of their peace and prosperity, therefore their hearts and lives are unchanged, Ps 55:19.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/48.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The valley - The lowlands on the east bank of the Jordan, and at the top of the Dead Sea.<p>The plain - An upland pasture; it answers very much to downs: so in <a href="/jeremiah/48-21.htm">Jeremiah 48:21</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/48.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9.

Yea, if they had wings, they should not escape, for the Lord is resolved that the cities of Moab shall be all brought to desolation, so as no inhabitants shall be left in them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/48.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Give wings unto Moab that it may flee and get away,.... That is, give wings to the inhabitants of Moab; signifying that they were in great danger, and there was no probability of escaping it, unless they had the wings of a swift bird, or were as swift as such, and even that would not do; though perhaps their fleeing, and passing away with wings, may signify not their fleeing from danger, and their attempt to escape; but their swift and sudden destruction, compared to the swift flight of a bird; for the last clause may be rendered, "for in flying it shall fly away" (o). Some render the first clause, "give a flower to Moab", as the Vulgate Latin version; and so the word sometimes signifies, <a href="/isaiah/40-7.htm">Isaiah 40:7</a>; and the sense may be, hold up a flower to Moab, or a feather, such as is light, as the down of a thistle, as an emblem of its destruction; which shall pass away as easily and swiftly as so light a thing before the wind; but Jarchi and Kimchi interpret the word as we do, a wing. The Targum is, <p>"take away the crown from Moab, for going it shall go away into captivity.'' <p>The word is used of the plate of gold on the high priest's mitre, <a href="/exodus/28-36.htm">Exodus 28:36</a>; <p>for the cities thereof shall be desolate, without any to dwell therein; which expresses the utter destruction of them. <p>(o)   "quia volando volabit", Pagninus, Montanus, Vatablus; "quia avolando avolabit", Schmidt; "nam avolabit", Piscator. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/48.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Give wings unto Moab, that it may flee and get away: for the cities thereof shall be desolate, without any to dwell therein.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/48.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">9</span>. <span class="ital">wings</span>] The sense is that nothing short of wings would enable the Moabites to escape before their enemies.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that she may fly and get her away</span>] or as mg. <span class="ital">for she must fly</span>; but better (so Dr.) <span class="bld">for she would fain fly away</span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/48.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9-16.</span> - So sudden is the blow that Moab stands in need of wings to make good his escape. Were the human instrument to delay, the curse meant for Moab would come upon himself. Is a reason demanded?

The words &#1513;&#1473;&#1491; &#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; are to be taken as the cry itself; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/4-20.htm">Jeremiah 4:20</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/20-8.htm">Jeremiah 20:8</a>. The city of Horonaim, mentioned both here and in <a href="/isaiah/15-5.htm">Isaiah 15:5</a> in connection with Luhith, lay on a slope, it would seem, not far from Luhith. Regarding this latter place we find it remarked in the Onomasticon: est usque hodie vicus inter Areopolim et Zoaram nomine Luitha (&#x39b;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#769;). As to  &#787;&#x3a9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bc;, the Onomasticon says no more than &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x39c;&#x3c9;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3b2; &#x3b5;&#768;&#x3bd;  &#788;&#x399;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#837; (ed. Lars. p. 376). The destruction over which the outcry is made comes on Moab. By "Moab" Graf refuses to understand the country or its inhabitants, but rather the ancient capital of the country, Ar-Moab (<a href="/numbers/21-28.htm">Numbers 21:28</a>; <a href="/isaiah/15-1.htm">Isaiah 15:1</a>), in the valley of the Arnon, which is also simply called Ar in <a href="/numbers/21-15.htm">Numbers 21:15</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/2-9.htm">Deuteronomy 2:9</a>. But, as Dietrich has already shown (S. 329ff.), the arguments adduced in support of this view are insufficient to prove the point.<p>(Note: The mention of Moab among names if cities in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-4.htm">Jeremiah 48:4</a>, and in connection with Kir-heres in <a href="/jeremiah/48-31.htm">Jeremiah 48:31</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/48-36.htm">Jeremiah 48:36</a> proves nothing; for in <a href="/jeremiah/48-4.htm">Jeremiah 48:4</a> Moab is not named among towns, and the expression in <a href="/jeremiah/48-31.htm">Jeremiah 48:31</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/48-36.htm">Jeremiah 48:36</a> is analogous to the phrase "Judah and Jerusalem." Nor can any proof be derived from the fact that Rabbath-Moab is merely called "Moab" in the Onomasticon of Eusebius, and Mb in Abulfeda, and Rabbath-Ammon, now merely "Amman;" because this mode of speaking will not admit of being applied for purposes of proof to matters pertaining to Old Testament times, since it originated only in the Christian ages,at a time, too, when Rabbath had become the capital of the country, and when Rabbath-Moab could easily be shortened by the common people into "Moab." Rabbath (of Moab), however, is not mentioned at all in the Old Testament.)<p>&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1512;, to break,of a nation or a city (<a href="/jeremiah/19-11.htm">Jeremiah 19:11</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/14-25.htm">Isaiah 14:25</a>, etc.), as it were, to ruin, - is here used of the country or kingdom. &#1510;&#1506;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492; is for &#1510;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492;, as in <a href="/jeremiah/14-3.htm">Jeremiah 14:3</a>. The little ones of Moab, that raise a cry, are neither the children (Vulgate, Dahler, Maurer), nor the small towns (Hitzig), nor the people of humble condition, but cives Moabi ad statum miserum dejecti (Kueper). The lxx have rendered &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x396;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1; (i.e., &#1510;&#1506;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492;), which reading is preferred by J. D. Michaelis, Ewald, Umbreit, Graf, Ngelsbach, but without sufficient reason; for neither the occurrence of Zoar in combination with Horonaim in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-34.htm">Jeremiah 48:34</a>, nor the parallel passage <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/15-5.htm">Isaiah 15:5</a>, will prove the point. <a href="/isaiah/15-5.htm">Isaiah 15:5</a> is not a parallel to this verse, but to <a href="/jeremiah/48-34.htm">Jeremiah 48:34</a>; however, the train of thought is different from that before us here. Besides, Jeremiah writes the name of the town &#1510;&#1506;&#1512; (not &#1510;&#1493;&#1506;&#1512;), cf. v. 34, as in <a href="/isaiah/15-5.htm">Isaiah 15:5</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/34-3.htm">Deuteronomy 34:3</a>; <a href="/genesis/13-10.htm">Genesis 13:10</a> (&#1510;&#1493;&#1506;&#1512; occurs only in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/19-22.htm">Genesis 19:22</a>, <a href="/genesis/19-30.htm">Genesis 19:30</a>); hence it is unlikely that &#1510;&#1506;&#1493;&#1512; has been written by mistake for &#1510;&#1493;&#1506;&#1512;.</body></html>
