The destruction of Moab is further prophesied, to awaken them by national repentance and reformation to prevent the trouble, or by a personal repentance and reformation to prepare for it. In reading this long roll of threatenings, and mediating on the terror, it will be of more use to us to keep in view the power of God's anger and the terror of his judgments, and to have our hearts possessed with a holy awe of God and of his wrath, than to search into all the figures and expressions here used. Yet it is not perpetual destruction. The chapter ends with a promise of their return out of captivity in the latter days. Even with Moabites God will not contend for ever, nor be always wroth. The Jews refer it to the days of the Messiah; then the captives of the Gentiles, under the yoke of sin and Satan, shall be brought back by Divine grace, which shall make them free indeed.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/48.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Dwell in the rock - See <a href="/jeremiah/4-29.htm">Jeremiah 4:29</a>.

Moab was the trumpeter of his own fame. Jeremiah adds "loftiness and arrogancy" to Isaiah's picture, so that Moab had not only not been bettered by the chastisement previously endured as foretold by Isaiah, but had even become worse; so that his guilt, and therefore his sentence of punishment, are increased now. Six times Moab's pride (or the synonyms) are mentioned, to show the exceeding hatefulness of his sin.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/48.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> There is a passage, <span class="bld"><a href="/isaiah/16-6.htm" title="We have heard of the pride of Moab; he is very proud: even of his haughtiness, and his pride, and his wrath: but his lies shall not be so.">Isaiah 16:6</a></span>, &c., concerning Moab, very little differing from this: Isaiah lived some years before this prophet, who yet complaineth of them for the same sins, so as they were not at all reformed. God saith he had heard of their pride and arrogancy; a vice which commonly attendeth ease and prosperity, and is exceeding odious in the sight of God, so as a wicked man is often in Scripture set out under the notion of a proud man. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/48.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>We have heard the pride of Moab,.... Israel, and all the nations round about, had heard of this, and seen or heard of many instances of it; the thing was notorious; according to Kimchi, it is the prophet that here speaks in the name of the nations; but it seems best to understand it of the Lord himself, as appears from the <a href="/jeremiah/48-30.htm">Jeremiah 48:30</a>; and who here speaks in the plural number, because of the plurality of persons in the Godhead; as he afterwards does in the singular number, to denote the unity of the divine essence: <p>(he is exceeding proud) his loftiness, and his arrogancy, and his pride, and the haughtiness of his heart; a heap of words to express the same thing; suggesting that the instances of his pride were many, and that it was exceeding great indeed: these many words were little enough; and indeed words were wanting fully to declare it.

They are towns of &#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1512;, the table-land to the north of the Arnon, the names of which early all occur in the Pentateuch and Joshua as towns in the tribe of Reuben. But Holon is mentioned only here. According to Eusebius, in the Onomasticon, s.v.  &#787;&#x399;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#769;, Jahzah was situated between &#x39c;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; (Medeba) and &#x394;&#x3b7;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c2; (Dibon); according to Jerome, between Medeba and Debus, or Deblathai; but from <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/21-23.htm">Numbers 21:23</a>, we conclude that it lay in an easterly direction, on the border of the desert, near the commencement of the Wady Wale. Mophaath or Mephaath, where, according to the Onomasticon, a Roman garrison was placed, on account of the near proximity of the desert, is to be sought for in the neighbourhood of Jahzah; see on <a href="/joshua/13-18.htm">Joshua 13:18</a>. As to Dibon, see on <a href="/jeremiah/48-18.htm">Jeremiah 48:18</a>; for Nebo, see on <a href="/jeremiah/48-1.htm">Jeremiah 48:1</a>. Beth-diblathaim is mentioned only in this passage. It is probably identical with Almon-diblathaim, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/33-46.htm">Numbers 33:46</a>, and to be sought for somewhere north from Dibon. For Kirjahthaim see <a href="/jeremiah/48-1.htm">Jeremiah 48:1</a>. Beth-gamul is nowhere else mentioned; its site, too, is unknown. Eli Smith, in Robinson's Palestine, iii. App. p. 153, is inclined to recognise it in the ruins of Um-el-Jemel, lying on the southern boundary of the Hauran, about twenty miles south-west from Bozrah; but a consideration of the position shows that they cannot be the same. Beth-meon, or Baal-meon (<a href="/numbers/32-38.htm">Numbers 32:38</a>), or more fully, Beth-baal-meon (<a href="/joshua/13-17.htm">Joshua 13:17</a>), lay about three miles south from Heshbon, where Burckhardt (p. 365) found some ruins called Mi-n (Robinson, iii. App. p. 170, Ma-n); see on <a href="/numbers/32-38.htm">Numbers 32:38</a>. Kerioth, <a href="/jeremiah/48-24.htm">Jeremiah 48:24</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-41.htm">Jeremiah 48:41</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/2-2.htm">Amos 2:2</a>, is not to be identified with the ruins called Kereyath or Kreiyath, mentioned by Burckhardt (p. 367) and Seetzen (Reisen, ii. 342, iv. 384), as Ritter has assumed; for this Kereyath is more probably Kirjathaim (see on <a href="/jeremiah/48-1.htm">Jeremiah 48:1</a>). Rather, as is pretty fully proved by Dietrich (in Merx' Archiv. i. 320ff.), it is a synonym of Ar, the old capital of Moab, <a href="/numbers/22-36.htm">Numbers 22:36</a>; and the plural form is to be accounted for by supposing that Ar was made up of two or several large portions. We find two great arguments supporting this position: (1.) When Ar, the capital, occurs among the names of the towns of Moab, as in the list of those in Reuben, <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/13-16.htm">Joshua 13:16-21</a>, and in the prophecy against Moab in Isaiah, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/15.htm">Jeremiah 15</a> and 16, where so many Moabitic towns are named, we find no mention of Kerioth; and on the other hand, where Kerioth is named as an important town in Moab, <a href="/amos/2-2.htm">Amos 2:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-1.htm">Jeremiah 48:1</a>, there is no mention of Ar. (2.) Kerioth is mentioned as an important place in the country in <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/2-2.htm">Amos 2:2</a>, where, from the whole arrangement of the prophecy, it can only be the capital of Moab; in this present chapter also, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-24.htm">Jeremiah 48:24</a>, Kerioth and Bozrah are introduced as two very important towns which maintained the strength of Moab; and immediately afterwards it is added, "The horn of Moab is cut off," etc. Further, in <a href="/jeremiah/48-41.htm">Jeremiah 48:41</a> the capture of Kerioth is put on a level with the taking of the fortresses; while it is added, that the courage of the mighty men has failed, just as in <a href="/jeremiah/49-22.htm">Jeremiah 49:22</a> the capture of Bozrah is coupled with the loss of courage on the part of Edom's heroes. Bozrah is not to be confounded with Bozrah in Edom (<a href="/jeremiah/49-13.htm">Jeremiah 49:13</a>), nor with the later flourishing city of Bostra in Hauran: it is the same with Bezer (&#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1512;), which, according to <a href="/deuteronomy/4-43.htm">Deuteronomy 4:43</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/20-8.htm">Joshua 20:8</a>, was situated in the Mishor of the tribe of Reuben, but has not yet been discovered; see on <a href="/deuteronomy/4-43.htm">Deuteronomy 4:43</a>. For the purpose of completing the enumeration, it is further added, "all the towns of the land of Moab, those which are far off (i.e., those which are situated towards the frontier) and those which are near" (i.e., the towns of the interior, as Kimchi has already explained). Thereby the horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm broken. Horn and arm are figures of power: the horn an emblem of power that boldly asserts itself, and pushes down all that opposes (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/75-5.htm">Psalm 75:5</a>, 11); the arm being rather an emblem of dominion. </body></html>
