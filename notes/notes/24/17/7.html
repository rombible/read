Those who trust to their own righteousness and strength, and think they can do without Christ, make flesh their arm, and their souls cannot prosper in graces or comforts. Those who make God their Hope, shall flourish like a tree always green, whose leaf does not wither. They shall be fixed in peace and satisfaction of mind; they shall not be anxious in a year of drought. Those who make God their Hope, have enough in him to make up the want of all creature-comforts. They shall not cease from yielding fruit in holiness and good works. The heart, the conscience of man, in his corrupt and fallen state, is deceitful above all things. It calls evil good, and good evil; and cries peace to those to whom it does not belong. Herein the heart is desperately wicked; it is deadly, it is desperate. The case is bad indeed, if the conscience, which should set right the errors of other faculties, is a leader in the delusion. We cannot know our own hearts, nor what they will do in an hour of temptation. Who can understand his errors? Much less can we know the hearts of others, or depend upon them. He that believes God's testimony in this matter, and learns to watch his own heart, will find this is a correct, though a sad picture, and learns many lessons to direct his conduct. But much in our own hearts and in the hearts of others, will remain unknown. Yet whatever wickedness there is in the heart, God sees it. Men may be imposed upon, but God cannot be deceived. He that gets riches, and not by right, though he may make them his hope, never shall have joy of them. This shows what vexation it is to a worldly man at death, that he must leave his riches behind; but though the wealth will not follow to another world, guilt will, and everlasting torment. The rich man takes pains to get an estate, and sits brooding upon it, but never has any satisfaction in it; by sinful courses it comes to nothing. Let us be wise in time; what we get, let us get it honestly; and what we have, use it charitably, that we may be wise for eternity.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Like the heath - Or, "like a destitute man" <a href="/psalms/102-17.htm">Psalm 102:17</a>.

These four verses are closely connected with the preceding, and show why it is necessary that Judah be cast forth amidst the heathen, by reason of its being perfectly stepped in idolatry. <a href="/jeremiah/17-1.htm">Jeremiah 17:1</a>. "The sin of Judah is written with an iron pen, with the point of a diamond graven on the table of their hearts and on the horns of your altars. <a href="/jeremiah/17-2.htm">Jeremiah 17:2</a>. As they remember their children, so do they their altars and their Astartes by the green tree upon the high hills. <a href="/jeremiah/17-3.htm">Jeremiah 17:3</a>. My mountain in the field, thy substance, all thy treasures give I for a prey, thy high places for sin in all thy borders. <a href="/jeremiah/17-4.htm">Jeremiah 17:4</a>. And thou shalt discontinue, and that of thine own self, from thine inheritance that I gave thee, and I cause thee to serve thine enemies in a land which thou knowest not; for a fire have ye kindled in mine anger, for ever it burneth."<p>The sin of Judah (<a href="/jeremiah/17-1.htm">Jeremiah 17:1</a>) is not their sinfulness, their proneness to sin, but their sinful practices, idolatry. This is written upon the tables of the hearts of them of Judah, i.e., stamped on them (cf. for this figure <a href="/proverbs/3-3.htm">Proverbs 3:3</a>; <a href="/proverbs/7-3.htm">Proverbs 7:3</a>), and that deep and firmly. This is intimated by the writing with an iron pen and graving with a diamond. &#1510;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1503;, from &#1510;&#1508;&#1512;, scratch, used in <a href="/deuteronomy/21-12.htm">Deuteronomy 21:12</a> for the nail of the finger, here of the point of the style or graving-iron, the diamond pencil which gravers use for carving in iron, steel, and stone.<p>(Note: Cf. Plinii hist. n. xxxvii. 15: crustae adamantis expetuntur a sculptoribus ferroque includuntur, nullam non duritiem ex facili excavantes.)<p>&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1512;, diamond, not emery as Boch. and Ros. supposed; cf. <a href="/ezekiel/3-9.htm">Ezekiel 3:9</a>; <a href="/zechariah/7-12.htm">Zechariah 7:12</a>. The things last mentioned are so to be distributed that "on the table of their heart" shall belong to "written with a pen of iron," and "on the horns of their altars" to "with the point of a diamond grave." The iron style was used only for writing or carving letters in a hard material, <a href="/job/19-24.htm">Job 19:24</a>. If with it one wrote on tables, it was for the purpose of impressing the writing very deeply, so that it could not easily be effaced. The having of sin engraved upon the tables of the heart does not mean that a sense of unatoned sin could not be got rid of (Graf); for with a sense of sin we have here nothing to do, but with the deep and firm root sin has taken in the heart. To the tables of the heart as the inward seat of sin are opposed the horns of their altars (at "altars" the discourse is directly addressed to the Jews). By altars are generally understood idolatrous altars, partly because of the plural, "since the altar of Jahveh was but one," partly because of <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-2.htm">Jeremiah 17:2</a>, where the altars in question are certainly those of the idols. But the first reason proves nothing, since the temple of the Lord itself contained two altars, on whose horns the blood of the sacrifice was sprinkled. The blood of the sin-offering was put not merely on the altar of burnt-offering, but also on the horns of the altar of incense, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/4-7.htm">Leviticus 4:7-8</a>; <a href="/leviticus/16-16.htm">Leviticus 16:16</a>. Nor is the second reason conclusive, since there is no difficulty in taking it to be the altars of Jahveh as defiled by idolatry. This, indeed, we must do, since Josiah had destroyed the altars of the false gods, whereas here the altars are spoken of as existing monuments of idolatry. The question, in how far the sin of Judah is ineffaceably engraven upon the horns of her altars, is variously answered by comm., and the answer depends on the view taken of <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-2.htm">Jeremiah 17:2</a>, which is itself disputed. It is certainly wrong to join <a href="/jeremiah/17-2.htm">Jeremiah 17:2</a> as protasis with <a href="/jeremiah/17-3.htm">Jeremiah 17:3</a> as apodosis, for it is incompatible with the beginning of <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-3.htm">Jeremiah 17:3</a>, &#1492;&#1512;&#1512;&#1497;. Ew. therefore proposes to attach "my mountain in the field" to <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-2.htm">Jeremiah 17:2</a>, and to change &#1492;&#1512;&#1512;&#1497; into &#1492;&#1512;&#1512;&#1497;: upon the high hills, the mountains in the field - a manifest makeshift. Umbr. translates: As their children remember their altars...so will I my mountain in the field, thy possession...give for a prey; and makes out the sense to be: "in proportion to the strength and ineffaceableness of the impressions, such as are to be found in the children of idolatrous fathers, must be the severity of the consequent punishment from God." But if this were the force, then &#1499;&#1468;&#1503; could not possibly be omitted before the apodosis; apart altogether from the suddenness of such a transition from the sins of the people (<a href="/jeremiah/17-1.htm">Jeremiah 17:1</a>) to the sins of the children.</body></html>
