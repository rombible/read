In its circumstances and mode of delivery it is parallel with the discourse of <a href="/context/jeremiah/22-1.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; Go down to the house of the king of Judah, and speak there this word,">Jeremiah 22:1-5</a>.<p><span class= "bld">The gate</span> <span class= "bld">of the children of the people . . .</span><span class= "ital">—</span>No gate so described is mentioned in the great topographical record of Nehemiah 3 or elsewhere, and we are therefore left to conjecture where it was. The context shows that it was a place of concourse, a gate of the Temple rather than of the city, perhaps the special gate by which the kings and people of Judah entered into the enclosure of the Temple. The name may indicate, as in <a href="/jeremiah/26-23.htm" title="And they fetched forth Urijah out of Egypt, and brought him to Jehoiakim the king; who slew him with the sword, and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people.">Jeremiah 26:23</a>, that it was that “of the common people,” or “laity,” as in <a href="/2_chronicles/35-5.htm" title="And stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the families of the fathers of your brothers the people, and after the division of the families of the Levites.">2Chronicles 35:5</a>, as dis tinguished from that used by the priests and Levites; and it would appear, from the nature of the warning proclaimed there, to have been the scene of some open desecration of the Sabbath—possibly of the sale of sheep or doves for sacrifice, like that of <a href="/john/2-14.htm" title="And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting:">John 2:14</a>; <a href="/matthew/21-12.htm" title="And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves,">Matthew 21:12</a>, or of the more common articles of the market, as in <a href="/nehemiah/13-15.htm" title="In those days saw I in Judah some treading wine presses on the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses; as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all manner of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day: and I testified against them in the day wherein they sold victuals.">Nehemiah 13:15</a>.

Some, indeed. have conjectured that we should read “gate of <span class= "ital">Benjamin </span>“instead of “gate of <span class= "ital">Beni-am,” </span>which gives the meaning “children of the people.” It is noticeable that the message was to be delivered at the other gates as well, as being a protest against a prevalent sin.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/17.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/jeremiah/17-19.htm" title="Thus said the LORD to me; Go and stand in the gate of the children of the people, whereby the kings of Judah come in, and by the which they go out, and in all the gates of Jerusalem;...">Jeremiah 17:19-24</a></span>. <span class="ital">Thus saith the Lord, Go, </span>&c. — Here we evidently have a distinct prophecy, which the prophet was commanded to deliver most probably soon, if not immediately, after the foregoing. <span class="ital">Stand in the gate of the children of the people </span>— By which It seems is meant the gate most frequented by the people; being that nearest the palace, where the kings of Judah held their most solemn courts of judicature, or by which they ordinarily went out of the city, and returned into it. <span class="ital">And say, Hear ye the word of the Lord, ye kings of Judah </span>— The word of the Lord equally concerns the highest and the lowest, the greatest princes as well as the meanest subjects. <span class="ital">Thus saith the Lord, Take heed to yourselves </span>— The Hebrew is, <span class="ital">Take heed to your souls, </span>intimating that the sanctification of the sabbath is an important thing, wherein the welfare of men’s souls is concerned. <span class="ital">Neither carry forth a burden, </span>&c. — See notes on <a href="/context/nehemiah/13-15.htm" title="In those days saw I in Judah some treading wine presses on the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses; as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all manner of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day: and I testified against them in the day wherein they sold victuals....">Nehemiah 13:15-22</a>. <span class="ital">Neither do ye any work </span>— Servile work was forbidden to be done upon their solemn festivals, <a href="/leviticus/23-8.htm" title="But you shall offer an offering made by fire to the LORD seven days: in the seventh day is an holy convocation: you shall do no servile work therein.">Leviticus 23:8</a>; <a href="/leviticus/23-35.htm" title="On the first day shall be an holy convocation: you shall do no servile work therein.">Leviticus 23:35</a>, much more upon the sabbath days. <span class="ital">But hallow ye the sabbath days </span>— “The sabbath was instituted as a sign or token of God’s covenant with his people, <a href="/exodus/31-13.htm" title="Speak you also to the children of Israel, saying, Truly my sabbaths you shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that you may know that I am the LORD that does sanctify you.">Exodus 31:13</a>, and the observance of it was the distinguishing character of a Jew, whereby he declared himself to be a worshipper of the true God, who made heaven and earth, and ordained the sabbath day as a memorial of the creation.

Take heed, watch against the profanation of the sabbath. Let not the soul be burdened with the cares of this world on sabbath days. The streams of religion run deep or shallow, according as the banks of the sabbath are kept up or neglected. The degree of strictness with which this ordinance is observed, or the neglect shown towards it, is a good test to find the state of spiritual religion in any land.

It is probably the same as "the gate of the fountain" at the foot of Zion, near which were the king's garden and pool (Jer 39:4; 2Ki 25:4; Ne 2:14; 3:15; 12:37).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/17.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Most think that here begins a new prophecy, and therefore this verse should have began a new chapter. The prophets were often commanded to publish such revelations as they had from God, either at the gates of the city, or the gates of the temple, <span class="bld"><a href="/jeremiah/7-2.htm" title="Stand in the gate of the LORD's house, and proclaim there this word, and say, Hear the word of the LORD, all you of Judah, that enter in at these gates to worship the LORD.">Jeremiah 7:2</a> 19:2</span>. It is not agreed what this particular gate was at which the kings of Judah were wont most ordinarily to come in and go out, but the prophet was also commanded to publish it in all the gates of Jerusalem, that all might take notice of it. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/17.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Thus said the Lord unto me,.... Here begins a new sermon or discourse, concerning the sanctification of the sabbath, and a very proper place to begin a new chapter: <p>Go and stand in the gate of the children of the people; where there were great numbers of people passing and repassing; and whither the people resorted upon one account or another; or where they dwelt. Some particular gate of the city of Jerusalem seems to be meant; and not the gate of the temple, as Abarbinel. Some think the sheep gate, and others the water gate, <a href="/nehemiah/3-1.htm">Nehemiah 3:1</a>; perhaps rather the latter, since the Nethinims dwelt near it, who were the Gibeonites, so called, because given to the congregation of Israel, to be hewers of wood and drawers of water to it; and these were "the children of the people", of the nations of the world, the old Canaanites, as well as they were the servants of the people of Israel: but what particular gate is intended is not certain; it is very likely it was one that was near the court, by what follows: <p>whereby the kings of Judah come in, and by which they go out; when they went out to war and returned; or went to their country houses and came back; or on any business and occasion whatever. This shows a reason why the prophet was to go and stand in this gate first; because his message was to be first delivered to these great personages, who had a personal concern herein, and who could influence others by their authority and example: <p>and in all the gates of Jerusalem; after he had been in the former, and delivered his message; for it concerned all the inhabitants of the city, high and low, rich and poor, male and female, young and old; and therefore he was to go to every gate, and stand and proclaim there, as being the most public places of resort and concourse, and where people were continually going and coming. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/17.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Thus said the LORD to me; Go and stand in the <span class="cverse3">{s}</span> gate of the children of the people, by which the kings of Judah come in, and by which they go out, and in all the gates of Jerusalem;</span><p>(s) While your doctrine may best be understood both by high and low.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/17.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">19</span>. <span class="ital">the gate of the children of the people</span>] (mg. <span class="ital">the common people</span>.

The expression is very difficult and probably corrupt. Du. suggests that the gate is one within the city and leading to the palace, thus accounting for its use by both the rulers, and those who sought an audience from them. It is better, however, to take “gate” in its ordinary application to a city gate. Peake suggests, by a slight change in MT., to read (as in <a href="/jeremiah/37-13.htm" title="And when he was in the gate of Benjamin, a captain of the ward was there, whose name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah; and he took Jeremiah the prophet, saying, You fall away to the Chaldeans.">Jeremiah 37:13</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/38-7.htm" title="Now when Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, one of the eunuchs which was in the king's house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon; the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin;">Jeremiah 38:7</a>) <span class="ital">in the gate of Benjamin</span> (on the N. side of the city). The mention of kings as using it has reference to <span class="ital"><a href="/jeremiah/17-25.htm" title="Then shall there enter into the gates of this city kings and princes sitting on the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, they, and their princes, the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem: and this city shall remain for ever.">Jeremiah 17:25</a></span>. He further suggests that “in all the gates of Jerusalem” may be a gloss. Dr. makes “the gate” to be “apparently (see <a href="/ezekiel/44-1.htm" title="Then he brought me back the way of the gate of the outward sanctuary which looks toward the east; and it was shut.">Ezekiel 44:1</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/44-3.htm" title="It is for the prince; the prince, he shall sit in it to eat bread before the LORD; he shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate, and shall go out by the way of the same.">Ezekiel 44:3</a> <span class="ital">b</span>, <a href="/jeremiah/46-1.htm" title="The word of the LORD which came to Jeremiah the prophet against the Gentiles;">Jeremiah 46:1</a> <span class="ital">a</span>, 2) either the outer or inner gate on the east, by which the kings of Judah entered and left the Temple.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Ch. <a href="/context/jeremiah/17-19.htm" title="Thus said the LORD to me; Go and stand in the gate of the children of the people, whereby the kings of Judah come in, and by the which they go out, and in all the gates of Jerusalem;...">Jeremiah 17:19-27</a>. An exhortation on the observance of the Sabbath<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This section is unconnected with the preceding, and, as it considers that the doom pronounced on Judah may be averted on condition of Sabbath observance, while the previous section has declared that that doom is inevitable, it has been placed by some, e.g. Orelli, as early as the time of Josiah’s reformation (see introd. note on <a href="/jeremiah/1-1.htm" title="The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests that were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin:">Jeremiah 1:1</a> to <a href="/jeremiah/12-6.htm" title="For even your brothers, and the house of your father, even they have dealt treacherously with you; yes, they have called a multitude after you: believe them not, though they speak fair words to you.">Jeremiah 12:6</a>), and by others (Stade, Kuenen, Gi., Du., Co.) held to be a piece belonging to the times of Ezra and Nehemiah (cp. <a href="/context/nehemiah/13-15.htm" title="In those days saw I in Judah some treading wine presses on the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses; as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all manner of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day: and I testified against them in the day wherein they sold victuals....">Nehemiah 13:15-22</a>). See also on <span class="ital"><a href="/jeremiah/17-20.htm" title="And say to them, Hear you the word of the LORD, you kings of Judah, and all Judah, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, that enter in by these gates:">Jeremiah 17:20</a></span>. The style, however, has much in common with Jeremiah, though this may be asserted to be due to imitation. It is argued that the general tone of the passage, and in particular the appreciation of sacrifice (<span class="ital"><a href="/jeremiah/17-26.htm" title="And they shall come from the cities of Judah, and from the places about Jerusalem, and from the land of Benjamin, and from the plain, and from the mountains, and from the south, bringing burnt offerings, and sacrifices, and meat offerings, and incense, and bringing sacrifices of praise, to the house of the LORD.">Jeremiah 17:26</a></span>) are not what we should expect. On the other hand “although no doubt Jeremiah speaks disparagingly of sacrifice offered by impure hands (<a href="/jeremiah/6-19.htm" title="Hear, O earth: behold, I will bring evil on this people, even the fruit of their thoughts, because they have not listened to my words, nor to my law, but rejected it.">Jeremiah 6:19</a> f., <a href="/jeremiah/7-9.htm" title="Will you steal, murder, and commit adultery, and swear falsely, and burn incense to Baal, and walk after other gods whom you know not;">Jeremiah 7:9</a> f., 21–26, <a href="/context/jeremiah/14-10.htm" title="Thus said the LORD to this people, Thus have they loved to wander, they have not refrained their feet, therefore the LORD does not accept them; he will now remember their iniquity, and visit their sins....">Jeremiah 14:10-12</a>), it may be questioned whether he would have rejected it when (as is the case explicitly in <a href="/jeremiah/17-26.htm" title="And they shall come from the cities of Judah, and from the places about Jerusalem, and from the land of Benjamin, and from the plain, and from the mountains, and from the south, bringing burnt offerings, and sacrifices, and meat offerings, and incense, and bringing sacrifices of praise, to the house of the LORD.">Jeremiah 17:26</a>) it is conceived as the expression of a right heart (cp. <a href="/jeremiah/33-11.htm" title="The voice of joy, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the voice of them that shall say, Praise the LORD of hosts: for the LORD is good; for his mercy endures for ever: and of them that shall bring the sacrifice of praise into the house of the LORD. For I will cause to return the captivity of the land, as at the first, said the LORD.">Jeremiah 33:11</a>; also <a href="/deuteronomy/12-11.htm" title="Then there shall be a place which the LORD your God shall choose to cause his name to dwell there; thither shall you bring all that I command you; your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, your tithes, and the heave offering of your hand, and all your choice vows which you vow to the LORD:">Deuteronomy 12:11</a>; <a href="/isaiah/56-7.htm" title="Even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer: their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted on my altar; for my house shall be called an house of prayer for all people.">Isaiah 56:7</a>; <a href="/isaiah/60-7.htm" title="All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered together to you, the rams of Nebaioth shall minister to you: they shall come up with acceptance on my altar, and I will glorify the house of my glory.">Isaiah 60:7</a>).” Dr. LOT. p. 258. At any rate, as we see from the Puritans, strong sabbatarianism need not be inconsistent with depreciation of the ceremonial side of worship.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The section may be subdivided as follows.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(i) <span class="ital"><a href="/context/jeremiah/17-19.htm" title="Thus said the LORD to me; Go and stand in the gate of the children of the people, whereby the kings of Judah come in, and by the which they go out, and in all the gates of Jerusalem;...">Jeremiah 17:19-23</a></span>. Jehovah tells the prophet to stand at the gate and forbid carriage of goods into and out of the city or houses on the Sabbath. The day is to be hallowed as He has commanded. The people refuse obedience. (ii) <span class="ital"><a href="/context/jeremiah/17-24.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, if you diligently listen to me, said the LORD, to bring in no burden through the gates of this city on the sabbath day, but hallow the sabbath day, to do no work therein;...">Jeremiah 17:24-27</a></span>.

The reward held out is Jerusalem's continuance in all its old pomp, both temporal and spiritual, and the penalty the destruction of the city by fire. This passage stands in absolutely no connection with the preceding and the following prophecies; and we have just the same sense of suspicion in meeting with it here, in the midst of perfectly general exhortations, as in reading the parallel exhortations to Sabbath-keeping in <a href="/isaiah/56.htm">Isaiah 56</a>. and 58, surrounded as they are by the moving and almost evangelical rhetoric of the second part of Isaiah. Geiger and Dr. Rowland Williams have hence been led to conjecture that this section (or part of it) was introduced into the roll of Jeremiah's prophecies to assist the reforming movement of Ezra and Nehemiah. Certainly the regard for the Sabbath, so conspicuous in the later Judaism, dates, so far as we can see, from the time of Ezra and Nehemiah (see <a href="/nehemiah/13.htm">Nehemiah 13</a>.), though it is credible enough that the perception of the high importance of this holy day (comp. Heine's 'Prinecssin Sabbath') began to acquire greater distinctness as the other parts of the social and religions organization were seen to be fading away (comp. art. "Sabbath" in Smith's 'Bible Dictionary'). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the gate of the children of the people</span>. It is uncertain which of the gates of Jerusalem is meant, and not perfectly clear what is the meaning of the title. Does it mean Israelites as opposed to foreigners, or laymen as distinguished from priests? <span class="cmt_word">Whereby the kings of Judah come in</span>. Jeremiah appears to use the phrase "kings of Judah" in a particular sense (see on ver. 20). He may, no doubt, simply mean to say that those who are from time to time sovereigns of Judah enter by this gate. But once grant that the prophet does sometimes use the phrase in a sense of his own, and that in the very next verse, and it is very difficult to avoid interpreting it so in this passage. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/17.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In <a href="/jeremiah/17-12.htm">Jeremiah 17:12</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/17-13.htm">Jeremiah 17:13</a> Jeremiah concludes this meditation with an address to the Lord, which the Lord corroborates by His own word.<p>Verse 12 is taken by many ancient comm. as a simple statement: a throne of glory, loftiness from the beginning, is the place of our sanctuary.

The "place of our sanctuary" is the temple as the spot where God sits throned amidst His people, not the heaven as God's throne: <a href="/isaiah/66-1.htm">Isaiah 66:1</a>. This the pronoun our does not befit, since heaven is never spoken of as the sanctuary of Israel. Hence we must refer both the preceding phrases to the earthly throne of God in the temple on Zion. The temple is in <a href="/jeremiah/14-21.htm">Jeremiah 14:21</a> called throne of the &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;, because in it Jahveh is enthroned above the ark; <a href="/exodus/25-22.htm">Exodus 25:22</a>; <a href="/psalms/80-2.htm">Psalm 80:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/99-1.htm">Psalm 99:1</a>. &#1502;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503; has here the sig. of &#1502;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;, <a href="/isaiah/40-21.htm">Isaiah 40:21</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/41-4.htm">Isaiah 41:4</a>, <a href="/isaiah/41-26.htm">Isaiah 41:26</a>; <a href="/isaiah/48-16.htm">Isaiah 48:16</a> : from the beginning onwards, from all time. Heaven as the proper throne of God is often called &#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1501;, loftiness; cf. <a href="/isaiah/57-15.htm">Isaiah 57:15</a>; <a href="/psalms/7-8.htm">Psalm 7:8</a>; but so also is Mount Zion as God's earthly dwelling-place; cf. <a href="/ezekiel/17-23.htm">Ezekiel 17:23</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/20-40.htm">Ezekiel 20:40</a>. Zion is called loftiness from the beginning, i.e., from immemorial time, as having been from eternity chosen to be the abode of God's glory upon earth; cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/15-17.htm">Exodus 15:17</a>, where in the song of Moses by the Red Sea, Mount Zion is pointed out prophetically as the place of the abode of Jahveh, inasmuch as it had been set apart thereto by the sacrifice of Isaac; see the expos. of <a href="/exodus/15-17.htm">Exodus 15:17</a>. Nor does &#1502;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; always mean the beginning of the world, but in <a href="/isaiah/41-26.htm">Isaiah 41:26</a> and <a href="/isaiah/48-16.htm">Isaiah 48:16</a> it is used of the beginning of the things then under discussion. From the place of Jahveh's throne amongst His people, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-13.htm">Jeremiah 17:13</a>, the discourse passes to Him who is there enthroned: Thou hope of Israel, Jahveh (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/14-8.htm">Jeremiah 14:8</a>), through whom Zion and the temple had attained to that eminence. The praise of God's throne prepares only the transition to praise of the Lord, who there makes known His glory. The address to Jahveh: Thou hope of Israel, is not a prayer directed to Him, so as to justify the objection against the vocative acceptation of <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-12.htm">Jeremiah 17:12</a>, that it were unseemly to address words of prayer to the temple. The juxtaposition of the sanctuary as the throne of God and of Jahveh, the hope of Israel, involves only that the forsaking of the sanctuary on Zion is a forsaking of Jahveh, the hope of Israel. It needs hardly be observed that this adverting to the temple as the seat of Jahve's throne, whence help may come, is not in contradiction to the warning given in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-4.htm">Jeremiah 7:4</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/7-9.htm">Jeremiah 7:9</a>. against false confidence in the temple as a power present to protect. That warning is aimed against the idolaters, who believed that God's presence was so bound up with the temple, that the latter was beyond the risk of harm. The Lord is really present in the temple on Zion only to those who draw near Him in the confidence of true faith. All who forsake the Lord come to shame. This word the Lord confirms through the mouth of the prophet in the second part of the verse. &#1497;&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;, according to the Chet., is a substantive from &#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, formed like &#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1489; from &#1512;&#1497;&#1489; (cf. Ew. 162, a); the Keri &#1493;&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497; is partic. from &#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; with &#1493; cop. - an uncalled-for conjecture. My departers  equals  those that depart from me, shall be written in the earth, in the loose earth, where writing speedily disappears. &#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, synonymous with &#1506;&#1508;&#1512;, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/job/14-8.htm">Job 14:8</a>, suggesting death. The antithesis to this is not the graving in rock, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/19-24.htm">Job 19:24</a>, but being written in the book of life; cf. <a href="/daniel/12-1.htm">Daniel 12:1</a> with <a href="/exodus/32-32.htm">Exodus 32:32</a>. In this direction the grounding clause points: they have forsaken the fountain of living water (<a href="/jeremiah/2-13.htm">Jeremiah 2:13</a>); for without water one must pine and perish. - On this follows directly,</body></html>
