The words are explained by what follows. The prophet had put his hope in Jehovah, but if he were left to himself, his message unfulfilled, himself a by-word and a jest, what a contrast would all this be to what he had been led to hope! Would not his work as a prophet be more terrible than ever? The feeling expressed is like that of <a href="/jeremiah/15-10.htm" title="Woe is me, my mother, that you have borne me a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth!

There is fulness of comfort in God, overflowing, ever-flowing fulness, like a fountain. It is always fresh and clear, like spring-water, while the pleasures of sin are puddle-waters. He prays to God for healing, saving mercy. He appeals to God concerning his faithful discharge of the office to which he was called. He humbly begs that God would own and protect him in the work to which he had plainly called him. Whatever wounds or diseases we find to be in our hearts and consciences, let us apply to the Lord to heal us, to save us, that our souls may praise his name. His hands can bind up the troubled conscience, and heal the broken heart; he can cure the worst diseases of our nature.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A terror - Rather, "a cause of dismay," or consternation <a href="/jeremiah/1-17.htm">Jeremiah 1:17</a>.

The &#1493; before &#1500;&#1514;&#1514;, which is wanting in many MSS and is not expressed by the old translators, is not to be objected to. It serves to separate the aim in view from the rest, and to give it the prominence due to an independent thought; cf. Ew. 340, b. As to the truth itself, cf. <a href="/jeremiah/32-19.htm">Jeremiah 32:19</a>. With this is joined the common saying as to the partridge, <a href="/jeremiah/17-11.htm">Jeremiah 17:11</a>. The aim is not to specify greed as another root of the corruption of the heart, or to give another case of false confidence in the earthly (Ng., Graf); but to corroborate by a common saying, whose truth should be obvious to the people, the greater truth, that God, as Searcher of hearts, requites each according to his works. The proverb ran: He that gains riches, and that by wrong, i.e., in an unjust, dishonourable manner, is like a partridge which hatches eggs it has not laid. In the Proverbs we often find comparisons, as here, without the &#1499;&#1468; similit.: a gainer of riches is a partridge (Rephuhn, properly Rphuhn from rpen  equals  rufen, to call or cry); a bird yet found in plenty in the tribe of Judah; cf. Robinson, Palestine. All other interpretations are arbitrary. It is true that natural history has not proved the fact of this peculiarity of the partridge, on which the proverb was founded; testimonies as to this habit of the creature are found only in certain Church fathers, and these were probably deduced from this passage (cf. Winer, bibl. R. W., art. Rebhuhn). But the proverb assumes only the fact that such was the widespread popular belief amongst the Israelites, without saying anything as to the correctness of it. "HatCheth and layeth not" are to be taken relatively. &#1491;&#1468;&#1490;&#1512;, the Targum word in <a href="/job/39-14.htm">Job 39:14</a> for &#1495;&#1502;&#1468;&#1501;, fovere, sig. hatch, lit., to hold eggs close together, cover eggs; see on <a href="/isaiah/34-15.htm">Isaiah 34:15</a>. &#1497;&#1500;&#1491;, to bring forth, here of laying eggs. As to the Kametz in both words, see Ew. 100, c. The point of the comparison, that the young hatched out of another bird's eggs forsake the mother, is brought out in the application of the proverb. Hence is to be explained "forsake him:" the riches forsake him, instead of: are lost to him, vanish, in the half of his days, i.e., in the midst of life; and at the end of his life he shall be a fool, i.e., the folly of his conduct shall fully appear.</body></html>
