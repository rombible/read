The word involves an allusion to the Law in <a href="/exodus/23-11.htm">Exodus 23:11</a> and (especially) <a href="/deuteronomy/15-2.htm">Deuteronomy 15:2</a> (see the Hebrew). The latter passage suggests a correction of the difficult "even with thyself," just preceding, into "thy hand." Thus we get for the opening of this verse, "And thou shalt let loose thy hand" (i.e. as Authorized Version, "shalt discontinue"). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/16.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div> In his cry to the Lord: My strength...in the day of trouble, which agrees closely with <a href="/psalms/28-8.htm">Psalm 28:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/59-17.htm">Psalm 59:17</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/18-3.htm">Psalm 18:3</a>, Jeremiah utters not merely his own feelings, but those which would animate every member of his people. In the time of need the powerlessness of the idols to help, and so their vanity, becomes apparent. Trouble therefore drives to God, the Almighty Lord and Ruler of the world, and forces to bend under His power. The coming tribulation is to have this fruit not only in the case of the Israelites, but also in that of the heathen nations, so that they shall see the vanity of the idolatry they have inherited from their fathers, and be converted to the Lord, the only true God. How this knowledge is to be awakened in the heathen, Jeremiah does not disclose; but it may be gathered from <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-15.htm">Jeremiah 16:15</a>, from the deliverance of Israel, there announced, out of the heathen lands into which they had been cast forth. By this deliverance the heathen will be made aware both of the almighty power of the God of Israel and of the nothingness of their own gods. On &#1492;&#1489;&#1500; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/2-5.htm">Jeremiah 2:5</a>; and with "none that profiteth," cf. <a href="/jeremiah/2-8.htm">Jeremiah 2:8</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/14-22.htm">Jeremiah 14:22</a>. In <a href="/jeremiah/16-20.htm">Jeremiah 16:20</a> the prophet confirms what the heathen have been saying. The question has a negative force, as is clear from the second clause. In <a href="/jeremiah/16-21.htm">Jeremiah 16:21</a> we have the Lord's answer to the prophets' confession in <a href="/jeremiah/16-19.htm">Jeremiah 16:19</a>. Since the Jews are so blinded that they prefer vain idols to the living God, He will this time so show them His hand and His strength in that foretold chastisement, that they shall know His name, i.e., know that He alone is God in deed and in truth. Cf. <a href="/ezekiel/12-15.htm">Ezekiel 12:15</a>; <a href="/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14</a>. </body></html>
