There is fulness of comfort in God, overflowing, ever-flowing fulness, like a fountain. It is always fresh and clear, like spring-water, while the pleasures of sin are puddle-waters. He prays to God for healing, saving mercy. He appeals to God concerning his faithful discharge of the office to which he was called. He humbly begs that God would own and protect him in the work to which he had plainly called him. Whatever wounds or diseases we find to be in our hearts and consciences, let us apply to the Lord to heal us, to save us, that our souls may praise his name.

This is grammatically defensible; but the view preferred by almost all moderns, that it is an apostrophe, is more in keeping with the tension of feeling in the discourse. The "place of our sanctuary" is the temple as the spot where God sits throned amidst His people, not the heaven as God's throne: <a href="/isaiah/66-1.htm">Isaiah 66:1</a>. This the pronoun our does not befit, since heaven is never spoken of as the sanctuary of Israel. Hence we must refer both the preceding phrases to the earthly throne of God in the temple on Zion. The temple is in <a href="/jeremiah/14-21.htm">Jeremiah 14:21</a> called throne of the &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;, because in it Jahveh is enthroned above the ark; <a href="/exodus/25-22.htm">Exodus 25:22</a>; <a href="/psalms/80-2.htm">Psalm 80:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/99-1.htm">Psalm 99:1</a>. &#1502;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503; has here the sig. of &#1502;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;, <a href="/isaiah/40-21.htm">Isaiah 40:21</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/41-4.htm">Isaiah 41:4</a>, <a href="/isaiah/41-26.htm">Isaiah 41:26</a>; <a href="/isaiah/48-16.htm">Isaiah 48:16</a> : from the beginning onwards, from all time. Heaven as the proper throne of God is often called &#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1501;, loftiness; cf. <a href="/isaiah/57-15.htm">Isaiah 57:15</a>; <a href="/psalms/7-8.htm">Psalm 7:8</a>; but so also is Mount Zion as God's earthly dwelling-place; cf. <a href="/ezekiel/17-23.htm">Ezekiel 17:23</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/20-40.htm">Ezekiel 20:40</a>. Zion is called loftiness from the beginning, i.e., from immemorial time, as having been from eternity chosen to be the abode of God's glory upon earth; cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/15-17.htm">Exodus 15:17</a>, where in the song of Moses by the Red Sea, Mount Zion is pointed out prophetically as the place of the abode of Jahveh, inasmuch as it had been set apart thereto by the sacrifice of Isaac; see the expos. of <a href="/exodus/15-17.htm">Exodus 15:17</a>. Nor does &#1502;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; always mean the beginning of the world, but in <a href="/isaiah/41-26.htm">Isaiah 41:26</a> and <a href="/isaiah/48-16.htm">Isaiah 48:16</a> it is used of the beginning of the things then under discussion. From the place of Jahveh's throne amongst His people, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-13.htm">Jeremiah 17:13</a>, the discourse passes to Him who is there enthroned: Thou hope of Israel, Jahveh (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/14-8.htm">Jeremiah 14:8</a>), through whom Zion and the temple had attained to that eminence. The praise of God's throne prepares only the transition to praise of the Lord, who there makes known His glory. The address to Jahveh: Thou hope of Israel, is not a prayer directed to Him, so as to justify the objection against the vocative acceptation of <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-12.htm">Jeremiah 17:12</a>, that it were unseemly to address words of prayer to the temple. The juxtaposition of the sanctuary as the throne of God and of Jahveh, the hope of Israel, involves only that the forsaking of the sanctuary on Zion is a forsaking of Jahveh, the hope of Israel. It needs hardly be observed that this adverting to the temple as the seat of Jahve's throne, whence help may come, is not in contradiction to the warning given in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-4.htm">Jeremiah 7:4</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/7-9.htm">Jeremiah 7:9</a>. against false confidence in the temple as a power present to protect. That warning is aimed against the idolaters, who believed that God's presence was so bound up with the temple, that the latter was beyond the risk of harm. The Lord is really present in the temple on Zion only to those who draw near Him in the confidence of true faith. All who forsake the Lord come to shame. This word the Lord confirms through the mouth of the prophet in the second part of the verse. &#1497;&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;, according to the Chet., is a substantive from &#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, formed like &#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1489; from &#1512;&#1497;&#1489; (cf. Ew. 162, a); the Keri &#1493;&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497; is partic. from &#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; with &#1493; cop. - an uncalled-for conjecture. My departers  equals  those that depart from me, shall be written in the earth, in the loose earth, where writing speedily disappears. &#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, synonymous with &#1506;&#1508;&#1512;, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/job/14-8.htm">Job 14:8</a>, suggesting death. The antithesis to this is not the graving in rock, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/19-24.htm">Job 19:24</a>, but being written in the book of life; cf. <a href="/daniel/12-1.htm">Daniel 12:1</a> with <a href="/exodus/32-32.htm">Exodus 32:32</a>. In this direction the grounding clause points: they have forsaken the fountain of living water (<a href="/jeremiah/2-13.htm">Jeremiah 2:13</a>); for without water one must pine and perish. - On this follows directly,</body></html>
