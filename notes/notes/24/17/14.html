He needs “healing” and “salvation,” but he knows where to seek for them, and is sure that his Lord will not leave the work incomplete. The prayer of the prophet is like that of the Psalmist (<a href="/psalms/6-2.htm" title="Have mercy on me, O LORD; for I am weak: O LORD, heal me; for my bones are vexed.">Psalm 6:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/30-2.htm" title="O LORD my God, I cried to you, and you have healed me.">Psalm 30:2</a>).

He represents himself as a person wounded, or sick, either with a sense of the dishonour done to God by the sins of the people, or with their reproaches poured upon himself, and he begs of God to heal him, God only having power to do it. <span class="ital">Save me, for thou art my praise </span>— It is from thee only that I expect relief and comfort in all my troubles: and as I acknowledge that all the blessings I enjoy come from thee, so it is to thee I return all thanks and praise.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/17.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>17:12-18 The prophet acknowledges the favour of God in setting up religion. There is fulness of comfort in God, overflowing, ever-flowing fulness, like a fountain. It is always fresh and clear, like spring-water, while the pleasures of sin are puddle-waters. He prays to God for healing, saving mercy. He appeals to God concerning his faithful discharge of the office to which he was called. He humbly begs that God would own and protect him in the work to which he had plainly called him. Whatever wounds or diseases we find to be in our hearts and consciences, let us apply to the Lord to heal us, to save us, that our souls may praise his name. His hands can bind up the troubled conscience, and heal the broken heart; he can cure the worst diseases of our nature.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Shall be written in the earth - i. e., their names shall quickly disappear, unlike those graven in the rock forever <a href="/job/19-24.htm">Job 19:24</a>.

These are the words of the prophet, sensible of his own sins and backslidings, and of the part which he himself had in these corrupt and declining times; and being conscious of his own impotency to cure himself; and being fully satisfied of the power of the Lord to heal him; and being well assured, if he was healed by him, he should be thoroughly and effectually healed; therefore he applies unto him. Sins are diseases; healing them is the forgiveness of them; God only can grant this: or this may have respect to the consolation of him, whose soul was distressed, grieved, and wounded, with the consideration of the sins of his people, and the calamities coming upon them on that account: <p>save me, and I shall be saved; with a temporal, spiritual, and eternal salvation; save me from the corruptions of the times, from the designs of my enemies; preserve me to thy kingdom and glory; there are none saved but whom the Lord saves, and those that are saved by him are saved to a purpose; they can never perish: <p>for thou art my praise; the cause of it, by reason of mercies bestowed; the object of it, whom he did and would praise evermore, because of his favours, particularly the blessings of healing and salvation by him; see <a href="/psalms/103-1.htm">Psalm 103:1</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/17.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Heal me, O LORD, and I shall be healed; <span class="cverse3">{n}</span> save me, and I shall be saved: for thou <i>art</i> my praise.</span><p>(n) He desires God to preserve him that he fall not into temptation, considering the great contempt of God's word, and the multitude that fall from God.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/17.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">14</span>.
