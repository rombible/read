Either the mother that has borne many children, seven being put for a large number, now being able to bear no more, and being bereaved of what she had, and who were her staff and support, and from whom she had her expectation, faints away, and dies through grief and trouble; or Jerusalem, which formerly abounded with young men, is now in a forlorn and destitute state; her children, the inhabitants of it, being slain with the sword, or dying of famine and the pestilence. In the Talmud (i), this is interpreted of seven wicked kings of Israel, as Jeroboam, Baasha, Ahab, Jehu, Pekah, Menahem, and Hoshea; and elsewhere of seven kings of Judah, thus reckoned, Jehoram, Joash, Ahaz, Manasseh, Amon, Jehoiakim, and Zedekiah (k): <p>she hath given up the ghost; or, "blew out her soul (l)"; her breath departs; no life can be kept in her; she faints away at the calamities coming on her: <p>her sun is gone down while it was yet day; the darkness of affliction, and the evening of distress and calamity came upon her sooner than was expected, while in the midst of peace and prosperity that was promised, and hoped to be enjoyed for a long time to come; see <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/8-9.htm">Amos 8:9</a>, <p>she hath been ashamed and confounded; of her vain hope, trust, and confidence: <p>and the residue of them will I deliver to the sword before their enemies, saith the Lord; that is; such who died not of the famine and pestilence, but at the breaking up of the city endeavoured to make their escape, these fell into the hands of the enemy, and perished by the sword, as the Lord here predicts; for whatsoever he says certainly comes to pass. <p>(i) T.

Even Moses and Samuel, who stood so far in God's favour that by their supplications they repeatedly rescued their people from overwhelming ruin (cf. <a href="/exodus/17-11.htm">Exodus 17:11</a>; <a href="/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11</a>., <a href="/numbers/14-13.htm">Numbers 14:13</a>., and <a href="/1_samuel/7-9.htm">1 Samuel 7:9</a>., <a href="/jeremiah/12-17.htm">Jeremiah 12:17</a>., <a href="/psalms/99-6.htm">Psalm 99:6</a>), if they were to come now before the Lord, would not incline His love towards this people. &#1488;&#1500; indicates the direction of the soul towards any one; in this connection: the inclination of it towards the people. He has cast off this people and will no longer let them come before His face. In <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-2.htm">Jeremiah 15:2-9</a> this is set forth with terrible earnestness. We must supply the object, "this people," to "drive" from the preceding clause. "From my face" implies the people's standing before the Lord in the temple, where they had appeared bringing sacrifices, and by prayer invoking His help (<a href="/jeremiah/14-12.htm">Jeremiah 14:12</a>). To go forth from the temple  equals  to go forth from God's face. <a href="/jeremiah/15-2.htm">Jeremiah 15:2</a>. But in case they ask where they are to go to, Jeremiah is to give them the sarcastic direction: Each to the destruction allotted to him. He that is appointed to death, shall go forth to death, etc. The clauses: such as are for death, etc., are to be filled up after the analogy of <a href="/2_samuel/15-20.htm">2 Samuel 15:20</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/8-1.htm">2 Kings 8:1</a>, so that before the second "death," "sword," etc., we supply the verb "shall go." There are mentioned four kinds of punishments that are to befall the people. The "death" mentioned over and above the sword is death by disease, for which we have in <a href="/jeremiah/14-12.htm">Jeremiah 14:12</a> &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;, pestilence, disease; cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-11.htm">Jeremiah 43:11</a>, where death, captivity, and sword are mentioned together, with <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-21.htm">Ezekiel 14:21</a>, sword, famine, wild beasts, and disease (&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;), and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-27.htm">Ezekiel 33:27</a>, sword, wild beasts, and disease. This doom is made more terrible in <a href="/jeremiah/15-3.htm">Jeremiah 15:3</a>. The Lord will appoint over them (&#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1491; as in <a href="/jeremiah/13-21.htm">Jeremiah 13:21</a>) four kinds, i.e., four different destructive powers which shall prepare a miserable end for them. One is the sword already mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-2.htm">Jeremiah 15:2</a>, which slays them; the three others are to execute judgment on the dead: the dogs which shall tear, mutilate, and partly devour the dead bodies (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/9-35.htm">2 Kings 9:35</a>, <a href="/2_kings/9-37.htm">2 Kings 9:37</a>), and birds and beasts of prey, vultures, jackals, and others, which shall make an end of such portions as are left by the dogs. In <a href="/jeremiah/15-4.htm">Jeremiah 15:4</a> the whole is summed up in the threatening of <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-25.htm">Deuteronomy 28:25</a>, that the people shall be delivered over to be abused to all the kingdoms of the earth, and the cause of this terrible judgment is mentioned.
