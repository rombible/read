Shall the most hardy and vigorous of their efforts be able to contend with the counsel of God, or with the army of the Chaldeans? Let them hear their doom. The enemy will treat the prophet well.

The prophet has been in a state of profound melancholy, and the object of Jehovah is to rouse him from it. In Vers. 11, 12, the most encouraging assurances have been given him. Suddenly comes the overwhelming declaration contained in Vers. 13, 14. And when we look closely at these verses, two points strike us, which make it difficult to conceive that Jeremiah intended them to stand here. First, their contents are not at all adapted to Jeremiah, and clearly belong to the people of Judah; and next, they are repeated, with some variations, in <a href="/jeremiah/17-3.htm">Jeremiah 17:3, 4</a>. It should also be observed that the Septuagint (which omits <a href="/jeremiah/17-1.htm">Jeremiah 17:1-4</a>) only gives them here, which seems to indicate an early opinion that the passage only ought to occur once in the Book of Jeremiah, though the Septuagint translator failed to choose the right position for it. <span class="cmt_word">Without price;</span> literally, not for a price. In the parallel passage there is another reading, "thy high places," which forms part of the next clause. Hitzig and Graf suppose this to be the original reading, the Hebrew letters having been partly effaced and then misread, after which "not" was prefixed to make sense. However this may be, the present reading is unintelligible, if we compare <a href="/isaiah/52-3.htm">Isaiah 52:3</a>, where Jehovah declares that his people were sold for nothing, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> were given up entirely to the enemy, without any compensating advantage to Jehovah. <span class="cmt_word">And that for all thy sins,</span> <span class="cmt_word">even</span>, etc.; literally, <span class="accented">and in all thy sins and in all thy borders</span>. The text is certainly difficult. Externally a parallelism exists between the two halves of the clause, and one is therefore tempted to render literally. As this will not make sense, however, we are forced either to render as the Authorized Version, or to suppose that the text is not accurately preserved. The parallel passage has a different but not a more intelligible reading. Ewald omits "and" in both halves of the clause, which slightly diminishes the awkwardness. <span class="cmt_word">And I will make thee to pass</span>, etc. The natural rendering of the Hebrew is, "And I will make thine enemies to pass," etc., which clearly cannot be the prophet's meaning. The parallel passage (<a href="/jeremiah/17-4.htm">Jeremiah 17:4</a>) has, "And I will make thee to serve thine enemies," etc.; and so the Septuagint, the Syriac, the Targum, and many manuscripts here. <span class="cmt_word">For a fire is kindled in mine anger</span>; a reminiscence of <a href="/deuteronomy/32-22.htm">Deuteronomy 32:22</a>, suggesting that the judgment described in the Song of Moses is about to fall upon Judah. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>&#1493;&#1488;&#1494;&#1512;&#1501; is a continuation of &#1493;&#1488;&#1496;, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-6.htm">Jeremiah 15:6</a>, and, like the latter, is to be understood prophetically of what God has irrevocably determined to do. It is not a description of what is past, an allusion to the battle lost at Megiddo, as Hitz., carrying out his  priori system of slighting prophecy, supposes. To take the verbs of this verse as proper preterites, as J. D. Mich. and Ew. also do, is not in keeping with the contents of the clauses. In the first clause Ew. and Gr. translate &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512;&#1497; gates, i.e., exits, boundaries of the earth, and thereby understand the remotest lands of the earth, the four corners of extremities of the earth, <a href="/isaiah/11-12.htm">Isaiah 11:12</a> (Ew.). But "gates" cannot be looked on as corners or extremities, nor are they ends or borders, but the inlets and outlets of cities. For how can a man construe to himself the ends of the earth as the outlets of it? where could one go to from there? Hence it is impossible to take &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; of the earth in this case; it is the land of Judah. The gates of the land are either mentioned by synecdoche for the cities, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/5-5.htm">Micah 5:5</a>, or are the approaches to the land (cf. <a href="/nahum/3-13.htm">Nahum 3:13</a>), its outlets and inlets. Here the context demands the latter sense. &#1494;&#1512;&#1492;, to fan, c. &#1489;&#1468; loci, to scatter into a place, cf. <a href="/ezekiel/12-15.htm">Ezekiel 12:15</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/30-26.htm">Ezekiel 30:26</a> : fan into the outlets of the land, i.e., cast out of the land. &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;, make the people childless, by the fall in battle of the sons, the young men, cf. <a href="/ezekiel/5-17.htm">Ezekiel 5:17</a>. The threat is intensified by &#1488;&#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, added as asyndeton. The last clause: from their ways, etc., subjoins the reason.</body></html>
