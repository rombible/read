Others take "mother," as in 2Sa 20:19, of Jerusalem, the metropolis; "I have brought on them, against the 'mother,' a young spoiler," namely, Nebuchadnezzar, sent by his father, Nabopolassar, to repulse the Egyptian invaders (2Ki 23:29; 24:1), and occupy Judea.

I have brought upon them against the mother of the young men a spoiler at noon-day</span>: there is a great variety amongst interpreters as to their sense of this phrase, about which those that are curious may consult the English Annotations upon this verse. By <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">the spoiler at noon-day</span> is meant Nebuchadnezzar, in the sense of the best interpreters, who came not like a thief, who cometh by night to rob and to spoil, but with an army in the day time: the question only is about those words <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">against the mother of the young men.</span> The Hebrew word, which our translation renders <span class="ital">young men</span>, is dxb which properly signifieth a choice man, or a person chosen, from the Hebrew verb which signifieth to choose; so as it may as well be translated <span class="ital">the mother of the chosen, as the mother of the young men</span>. Because young men are looked upon as the choice men, whether for beauty, or strength and ability for any thing, the word often signifies a young man, <span class="bld"><a href="/deuteronomy/32-25.htm" title="The sword without, and terror within, shall destroy both the young man and the virgin, the suckling also with the man of gray hairs.">Deu 32:25</a> <a href="/2_samuel/6-1.htm" title="Again, David gathered together all the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand.">2 Samuel 6:1</a> <a href="/psalms/148-12.htm" title="Both young men, and maidens; old men, and children:">Psalm 148:12</a> <a href="/songs/5-15.htm" title="His legs are as pillars of marble, set on sockets of fine gold: his countenance is as Lebanon, excellent as the cedars.">Song of Solomon 5:15</a> <a href="/isaiah/23-4.htm" title="Be you ashamed, O Zidon: for the sea has spoken, even the strength of the sea, saying, I travail not, nor bring forth children, neither do I nourish up young men, nor bring up virgins.">Isaiah 23:4</a> <a href="/ezekiel/9-6.htm" title="Slay utterly old and young, both maids, and little children, and women: but come not near any man on whom is the mark; and begin at my sanctuary.

Some will have the sense, (as in our margin,) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">against the mother a young man, </span> meaning by the young man Nebuchadnezzar, and by the <span class="ital">mother</span> Jerusalem. The Jews are in the Canticles called the <span class="ital">daughters of Jerusalem</span>, and Jerusalem which is above is by the apostle called <span class="ital">the mother of us all</span>. The Hebrew word is in the singular number; how we translate it <span class="ital">young men</span> I understand not. Pagnine translates it <span class="ital">electi</span>, the mother of the chosen. I do think that by the <span class="ital">mother</span> is meant Jerusalem, and that <span class="ital">populi</span> may be understood to <span class="ital">electi</span>. Jerusalem was the mother of the Jewish people, or Judea at least, against whom Nebuchadnezzar the spoiler at noon-day was sent; and we know that the Jews were God’s <span class="ital">chosen people. I have caused him to fall upon it suddenly, and terrors upon the city</span>: this last clause is yet more obscure than the other; word for word, as it is in the Hebrew, it is, <span class="ital">I have caused to fall upon it suddenly, the city and terrors</span>. The word here used dyu commonly signifies a city in Scripture, and is very rarely translated otherwise. Were it not for the adverb suddenly coming between it and city, the sense were plain, and thus, <span class="ital">I will cause to fall upon that city terrors</span>; others read it, I will cause him to fall upon it, terrors upon the city. The word sometimes in Scripture signifies enemies, and is so translated, <span class="bld"><a href="/1_samuel/28-16.htm" title="Then said Samuel, Why then do you ask of me, seeing the LORD is departed from you, and is become your enemy?">1 Samuel 28:16</a> <a href="/psalms/139-20.htm" title="For they speak against you wickedly, and your enemies take your name in vain.">Psalm 139:20</a> <a href="/daniel/4-19.htm" title="Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was astonished for one hour, and his thoughts troubled him.

The children of Israel were to be as the sand of the sea, and were very numerous; and here the widows are said to be so too, their husbands, who were numerous, being dead; and this, as it was of the Lord, so it was in his sight, and according to his counsel and will. Mention is made of "seas", in the plural, number, there being many in or near Judea, as the Red sea, the sea of Galilee, and the Mediterranean sea: <p>I have brought upon them against the mother of the young men a spoiler, at noonday; that is he would bring upon the Jews, against the mother of the young men, or mothers of them; for the young men being destroyed by the spoiler, it was against them; a calamity upon them, and a distress unto them, who have generally a tender concern for them. The Targum is, <p>"against the company of their young men;'' <p>the Jews; or against Jerusalem, the mother city, the metropolis of the nation, full of young men fit for war: or, "against the mother", that is, Jerusalem, a "young man" (e); meaning Nebuchadnezzar, who came against Jerusalem in the first year of his reign; and, as some say, in the eighteenth year of his age; and who came not as a thief in the night, but as a spoiler at noonday; not in a secret insidious manner, but openly and with force of arms making his way through the land to Jerusalem, in defiance of the Jews, and in the face of them: <p>and I have caused him to fall upon it suddenly; that is, upon the city of Jerusalem: for though he came openly, his march was quick, and he was presently at Jerusalem, and laid siege to it at once: <p>and terrors upon the city; or, "city and terrors" (f); the city was immediately filled with terrors at the appearance of Nebuchadnezzar and his army. R. Joseph Kimchi interprets it, "an army and terrors", from <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-16.htm">1 Samuel 28:16</a>, the Babylonian monarch, at the head of his army, which spread terrors where he came. Some render the word, from <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/4-13.htm">Daniel 4:13</a>, "a watcher and terrors" (g): meaning the Chaldean army, called watchers, <a href="/jeremiah/4-16.htm">Jeremiah 4:16</a>.

We must supply the object, "this people," to "drive" from the preceding clause. "From my face" implies the people's standing before the Lord in the temple, where they had appeared bringing sacrifices, and by prayer invoking His help (<a href="/jeremiah/14-12.htm">Jeremiah 14:12</a>). To go forth from the temple  equals  to go forth from God's face. <a href="/jeremiah/15-2.htm">Jeremiah 15:2</a>. But in case they ask where they are to go to, Jeremiah is to give them the sarcastic direction: Each to the destruction allotted to him.

This doom is made more terrible in <a href="/jeremiah/15-3.htm">Jeremiah 15:3</a>. The Lord will appoint over them (&#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1491; as in <a href="/jeremiah/13-21.htm">Jeremiah 13:21</a>) four kinds, i.e., four different destructive powers which shall prepare a miserable end for them. One is the sword already mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-2.htm">Jeremiah 15:2</a>, which slays them; the three others are to execute judgment on the dead: the dogs which shall tear, mutilate, and partly devour the dead bodies (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/9-35.htm">2 Kings 9:35</a>, <a href="/2_kings/9-37.htm">2 Kings 9:37</a>), and birds and beasts of prey, vultures, jackals, and others, which shall make an end of such portions as are left by the dogs. In <a href="/jeremiah/15-4.htm">Jeremiah 15:4</a> the whole is summed up in the threatening of <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-25.htm">Deuteronomy 28:25</a>, that the people shall be delivered over to be abused to all the kingdoms of the earth, and the cause of this terrible judgment is mentioned.

For the sake of King Manasseh, who by his godless courses had filled up the measure of the people's sins, so that the Lord must cast Judah away from His face, and give it up to the heathen to be chastised; cf. <a href="/2_kings/23-26.htm">2 Kings 23:26</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/24-3.htm">2 Kings 24:3</a>, with the exposition of these passages; and as to what Manasseh did, see <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/21-1.htm">2 Kings 21:1-16</a>. </body></html>
