The sequence of thought may, however, be that the picture of the sorrowing mother in the previous verses suggests the reflection that there may be other causes for a mother’s sorrow than that of which he has spoken, and so he bursts out into the cry, “Woe is me, my mother!” The prophet feels more than ever the awfulness of his calling as a vessel of God’s truth. He, too, found that he had come “not to send peace on earth, but a sword” (<a href="/matthew/10-34.htm" title="Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.">Matthew 10:34</a>). His days were as full of strife as the life of the usurer, whose quarrels with his debtors had become the proverbial type of endless litigation. As examples of the working of the law of debt, see <a href="/exodus/22-25.htm" title="If you lend money to any of my people that is poor by you, you shall not be to him as an usurer, neither shall you lay on him usury.">Exodus 22:25</a>; <a href="/2_kings/4-1.htm" title="Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets to Elisha, saying, Your servant my husband is dead; and you know that your servant did fear the LORD: and the creditor is come to take to him my two sons to be slaves.">2Kings 4:1</a>; <a href="/context/proverbs/6-1.htm" title="My son, if you be surety for your friend, if you have stricken your hand with a stranger,">Proverbs 6:1-5</a>; <a href="/isaiah/24-2.htm" title="And it shall be, as with the people, so with the priest; as with the servant, so with his master; as with the maid, so with her mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller; as with the lender, so with the borrower; as with the taker of usury, so with the giver of usury to him.">Isaiah 24:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/15-5.htm" title="He that puts not out his money to usury, nor takes reward against the innocent.

This was the lot of the old prophets, the lot of Samuel, of Christ, of his apostles, and of all the faithful ministers of the gospel ever since; let them carry themselves never so innocently and obligingly to people, yet if they will be faithful, and truly reveal unto people the mind and will of God, that is enough to anger a people whose wills are not subjugated to the will of God, and they will curse them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/15.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Woe is me, my mother, that thou hast born me a man of strife,.... Not that the prophet was a quarrelsome and contentious man, but others quarrelled and contended with him, and that for no other reason than for his faithful discharge of his office, under which he ought to have been easy; but being a man of like passions with others, wishes he had never been born, than to meet with so much trouble; and seems to blame his mother for bearing him; or however looked upon himself to be a miserable man through his birth, and that he was destined from thence to this sorrow: <p>and a man of contention to the whole earth; or "land"; the land of Judea, the inhabitants of it, as the Targum; for with no other had Jeremiah to do; and it were these only that contended with him, because he brought a disagreeable message to them, concerning their captivity: <p>I have neither lent on usury, nor men have lent to me on usury; which was not lawful with the Jews to do; and therefore such were cursed that did it: but this is not to be restrained to this particular branch of business, which was not usual; but has respect to all trade and commerce; and the meaning is, that the prophet did not concern himself with secular affairs, but attended to the duties of his office; he carried on no negotiations with men; he was neither a creditor nor a debtor; had nothing to do with pecuniary affairs; which often occasions strifes and contentions, quarrels and lawsuits; and yet, notwithstanding, could not be free from strife and debate: <p>yet everyone of them do curse me; that is, everyone of the inhabitants of the land of Judea, so much known were Jeremiah and his prophecies; these slighted and set light by both him and his predictions; and wished the vilest imprecations upon him for his messages to them. The word here used is compounded of two words, or derived from two roots, as Kimchi observes; the one signifies to make light or vilify, in opposition to honour and glory; and the other to curse, in opposition to blessing; and this is often the case of the ministers of the word, not only to be slighted and despised, but to be defamed and cursed; see <a href="/1_corinthians/4-12.htm">1 Corinthians 4:12</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/15.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{k}</span> Woe is me, my mother, that thou hast borne me a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth!

They describe some deeply pathetic moment of the prophet's inner life, and in all probability belong to a later period of the history of Judah. At any rate, the appreciation of the next chapter will be facilitated by reading it in close connection with Ver. 9 of the present chapter. But the section before us is too impressive to be east adrift without an attempt to find a place for it in the life of the prophet. The attempt has been made with some plausibility by a Jewish scholar, Dr. Gratz, who considers the background of these verses to be the sojourn of Jeremiah at Ramah, referred to in <a href="/jeremiah/40-1.htm">Jeremiah 40:1</a>, and groups them, therefore, with another prophecy (<a href="/jeremiah/31-15.htm">Jeremiah 31:15-17</a>), in which Ramah is mentioned by name as the temporary abode of the Jewish captives. We are told in <a href="/jeremiah/40-4.htm">Jeremiah 40:4, 5</a>, that Jeremiah had the choice given him of either going to Babylon with the exiles, or dwelling with the Jews who were allowed to remain under Gedaliah the governor. He chose, as the narrative in <a href="/jeremiah/40.htm">Jeremiah 40</a>. tells us, to stay with Gedaliah; but the narrative could not, in accordance with the reserve which characterizes the inspired writers, reveal the state of mind in which this difficult choice was made. This omission is supplied in the paragraph before us. Jeremiah, with that lyric tendency peculiar to him among the prophets, gives a vent to his emotion in these impassioned verses. He tells his friends that the resolution to go to Gedaliah may cost him a severe struggle. He longs for rest, and in Babylon he would have more chance of a quiet life than among the turbulent Jews at home. But he has looked up to God for guidance, and, however painful to the flesh, God's will must be obeyed. He gives us the substance of the revelation which he received. The Divine counselor points out that he has already interposed in the most striking manner for Jeremiah, and declares that if he will devote himself to the Jews under Gedaliah, a new and fruitful field will be open to him, in which, moreover, by Divine appointment, no harm can happen to him. Whether this is really the background of the paragraph must remain uncertain. In a case of this kind, we are obliged to call in the help of the imagination, if the words of the prophet are to be realized with any degree of vividness. There are some great difficulties in the text, and apparently one interpolation (Vers. 13, 14 being in all probability an incorrect copy of <a href="/jeremiah/17-3.htm">Jeremiah 17:3, 4</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Woe is me, my mother</span>!

Even Moses and Samuel, who stood so far in God's favour that by their supplications they repeatedly rescued their people from overwhelming ruin (cf. <a href="/exodus/17-11.htm">Exodus 17:11</a>; <a href="/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11</a>., <a href="/numbers/14-13.htm">Numbers 14:13</a>., and <a href="/1_samuel/7-9.htm">1 Samuel 7:9</a>., <a href="/jeremiah/12-17.htm">Jeremiah 12:17</a>., <a href="/psalms/99-6.htm">Psalm 99:6</a>), if they were to come now before the Lord, would not incline His love towards this people. &#1488;&#1500; indicates the direction of the soul towards any one; in this connection: the inclination of it towards the people. He has cast off this people and will no longer let them come before His face. In <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-2.htm">Jeremiah 15:2-9</a> this is set forth with terrible earnestness. We must supply the object, "this people," to "drive" from the preceding clause. "From my face" implies the people's standing before the Lord in the temple, where they had appeared bringing sacrifices, and by prayer invoking His help (<a href="/jeremiah/14-12.htm">Jeremiah 14:12</a>). To go forth from the temple  equals  to go forth from God's face. <a href="/jeremiah/15-2.htm">Jeremiah 15:2</a>. But in case they ask where they are to go to, Jeremiah is to give them the sarcastic direction: Each to the destruction allotted to him. He that is appointed to death, shall go forth to death, etc. The clauses: such as are for death, etc., are to be filled up after the analogy of <a href="/2_samuel/15-20.htm">2 Samuel 15:20</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/8-1.htm">2 Kings 8:1</a>, so that before the second "death," "sword," etc., we supply the verb "shall go." There are mentioned four kinds of punishments that are to befall the people. The "death" mentioned over and above the sword is death by disease, for which we have in <a href="/jeremiah/14-12.htm">Jeremiah 14:12</a> &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;, pestilence, disease; cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-11.htm">Jeremiah 43:11</a>, where death, captivity, and sword are mentioned together, with <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-21.htm">Ezekiel 14:21</a>, sword, famine, wild beasts, and disease (&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;), and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-27.htm">Ezekiel 33:27</a>, sword, wild beasts, and disease. This doom is made more terrible in <a href="/jeremiah/15-3.htm">Jeremiah 15:3</a>. The Lord will appoint over them (&#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1491; as in <a href="/jeremiah/13-21.htm">Jeremiah 13:21</a>) four kinds, i.e., four different destructive powers which shall prepare a miserable end for them. One is the sword already mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-2.htm">Jeremiah 15:2</a>, which slays them; the three others are to execute judgment on the dead: the dogs which shall tear, mutilate, and partly devour the dead bodies (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/9-35.htm">2 Kings 9:35</a>, <a href="/2_kings/9-37.htm">2 Kings 9:37</a>), and birds and beasts of prey, vultures, jackals, and others, which shall make an end of such portions as are left by the dogs. In <a href="/jeremiah/15-4.htm">Jeremiah 15:4</a> the whole is summed up in the threatening of <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-25.htm">Deuteronomy 28:25</a>, that the people shall be delivered over to be abused to all the kingdoms of the earth, and the cause of this terrible judgment is mentioned. The Chet. &#1494;&#1493;&#1506;&#1492; is not to be read &#1494;&#1493;&#1506;&#1492;, but &#1494;&#1493;&#1506;&#1492;, and is the contracted form from &#1494;&#1506;&#1493;&#1492;, see on <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-25.htm">Deuteronomy 28:25</a>, from the rad. &#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;, lit., tossing hither and thither, hence for maltreatment. For the sake of King Manasseh, who by his godless courses had filled up the measure of the people's sins, so that the Lord must cast Judah away from His face, and give it up to the heathen to be chastised; cf. <a href="/2_kings/23-26.htm">2 Kings 23:26</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/24-3.htm">2 Kings 24:3</a>, with the exposition of these passages; and as to what Manasseh did, see <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/21-1.htm">2 Kings 21:1-16</a>. </body></html>
