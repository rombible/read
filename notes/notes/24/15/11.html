They who think that they shall be the surviving remnant, whereas thou shalt perish, shall themselves fall, whereas thou shalt remain and be favored by the conquerors [Junius], (Jer 40:4, 5; 39:11, 12). The Keri reads, "I will set thee free (or as Maurer, 'I will establish thee') for good" (Jer 14:11; Ezr 8:22; Ps 119:122).<p>to entreat thee well&#8212;literally, "to meet thee"; so "to be placable, nay, of their own accord to anticipate in meeting thee with kindness" [Calvin]. I prefer this translation as according with the event (Jer 39:11, 12; 40:4, 5). Gesenius, from Jer 7:16; 27:18; Job 21:15, translates (not only will I relieve thee from the enemy's vexations, but) "I will make thine enemy (that now vexeth thee) apply to thee with prayers" (Jer 38:14; 42:2-6).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The latter words of the verse expound the former; for by remnant is here meant the residue or remnant of days Jeremiah had yet to live, not the remnant of the people who should come out of Babylon. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I will cause the enemy to entreat thee well in the time of evil and in the time of affliction; </span> I will, by my providence, so order it, that how cruelly and severely soever the enemy deals with thy country, yet he shall use thee kindly when he shall take the city.

In answer to the prophet's complaint: <p>verily it shall be well with thy remnant: not with the remnant of his people, or those that should escape the threatened calamities; but the sense is, that it should be well with him in his latter end; the remainder of his days should be comfortable or be spent in peace and prosperity; and so the Targum, <p>"if thine end shall not be for good.'' <p>The words are in the form of an oath, as Kimchi and Ben Melech observe; and the meaning is, that if it is not well with thee in thy last days, then say I am unfaithful, and not true to my word. According to Donesh, cited by Jarchi, the word translated "remnant" has the signification of loosing; and he renders it, "if I loose thee not for good" (m); which accordingly was done, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-4.htm">Jeremiah 40:4</a>, and this sense is confirmed by the note of the Masorites: "verily I will cause the enemy to entreat thee well"; or, "if I do not", &amp;c. for it is also in the form of an oath, as before, as Jarchi notes; and so it was, Nebuchadnezzar gave charge to Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, to look well to him, and do him no harm; who, when he loosed him, gave him his choice to go with him to Babylon, or continue in the land, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-11.htm">Jeremiah 39:11</a>, or, "verily I will", or, "shall I not entreat the enemy for thee?" (n) and make him gentle and humane, so that he shall use thee kindly. Jarchi interprets this of Zedekiah and his courtiers seeking to Jeremiah, in the time of their distress, to pray for them, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-2.htm">Jeremiah 37:2</a>, and to which sense the Targum inclines, <p>"if they shall not come and help thee, &amp;c.'' <p>in the time of evil, and in the time of affliction; when the city is taken, and the people carrying captive. <p>(m)    "si non absolvero te in bonum", Schmidt.

The <span class="ital">v</span>. is difficult without applying considerable conjectural emendation. The whole is best taken as Jeremiah’s utterance. “The Lord said “is not a formula which elsewhere in Jeremiah introduces a Divine utterance. The LXX’s rendering of the passage, however, suggests that their text had the usual formula. The verb translated “strengthen” is not pure Heb. but Aramaic. <span class="ital"><a href="/jeremiah/15-10.htm" title="Woe is me, my mother, that you have borne me a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth!

Hence Co. with certain changes in MT. renders “Amen, Jehovah, to their curses, if I did not make intercession with Thee for the enemy’s welfare at the time of their misfortune and need.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">strengthen</span>] mg. suggests <span class="ital">release</span>, which is perhaps the meaning of the reading in MT.

But see above.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord said</span>. The prophets are usually so tenacious of the same formulae that even their slight deviations are noteworthy. "The Lord said," for "Thus saith the Lord," occurs only here and in <a href="/jeremiah/46-25.htm">Jeremiah 46:25</a> (where, however, the phrase has possibly been detached by mistake from the preceding verse). <span class="cmt_word">It shall be well with thy remnant</span>; rather, <span class="accented">I have loosed thee</span> <span class="accented">for</span> (<span class="accented">thy</span>) <span class="accented">good</span>, or, <span class="accented">thy loosing</span> (<span class="accented">shall be</span>) <span class="accented">for</span> (<span class="accented">thy good</span>), according as we adopt the reading of the Hebrew text or that of the margin, which differs in form as slightly as it is possible to do. If we accept the historical setting proposed by Gratz for this paragraph, the reference will be to the "loosing" of Jeremiah from his chains mentioned in <a href="/jeremiah/40-4.htm">Jeremiah 40:4</a>. The rendering given here is, however, only a probable one; it is in conformity with the Aramaic usage of the verb (the Targum uses it in this sense in <a href="/jeremiah/40-4.htm">Jeremiah 40:4</a>), and is supported by its suitability to the context and, philologically, by the fact of the growing influence of Aramaic upon Hebrew. Gesenius, in his anxiety to keep close to the native use of the root, produces a rendering (of the Hebrew marginal reading) which does not suit the context, viz. "I afflict thee for (thy) good." Jeremiah does not complain of being afflicted by God, but that all the world is against him; Ewald, comparing a different Aramaic verb to that appealed to above, renders, "I strengthen thee," etc., which is adopted by Keil, but does not accord with the second half of the verse so well as the rendering adopted. The Authorized Version follows the Targum, the Vulgate, Aquila, Symmachus, Rashi, and Kimchi, assuming that <span class="accented">sherith</span> is contracted from <span class="accented">sh'erith</span> (as in <a href="/1_chronicles/12-38.htm">1 Chronicles 12:38</a>), and that "remnant" is equivalent to "remnant of life." But, though the sense is not unacceptable (comp. Vers. 20, 21), the form of expression is unnatural; we should have expected <span class="accented">akharith'ka</span>, "thy latter end" (comp. <a href="/job/8-7.htm">Job 8:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I will cause the enemy to entreat thee well</span>. This expression is as difficult as the preceding, and our rendering of it will depend entirely on our view of the context. If "the enemy" means the Chaldeans, the Authorized Version will be substantially correct. Rashi has already mentioned the view that the phrase alludes to Nebnzar-adan's respectful inquiry as to the wishes of Jeremiah in <a href="/jeremiah/40-2.htm">Jeremiah 40:2-5</a>. In this case, the literal rendering is, <span class="accented">I</span> <span class="accented">will cause the enemy to meet thee</span> (<span class="accented">as a friend</span>); comp. <a href="/isaiah/47-3.htm">Isaiah 47:3</a>; <a href="/isaiah/64-4.htm">Isaiah 64:4</a>. But if "the enemy" means the Jews, then we must render, 1 <span class="accented">grill cause the enemy to supplicate thee</span>, and illustrate the phrase by the repeated applications of Zedekiah to the prophet (<a href="/jeremiah/21-1.htm">Jeremiah 21:1, 2</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/37-3.htm">Jeremiah 37:3</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/38-14.htm">Jeremiah 38:14</a>), and the similar appeal of the "captains of the forces," in <a href="/jeremiah/42-1.htm">Jeremiah 42:1-3</a>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-5.htm">Jeremiah 15:5-9</a> we have a still further account of this appalling judgment and its causes.
