Jeremiah pleads with God for mercy and relief against his enemies, persecutors, and slanderers. It will be a comfort to God's ministers, when men despise them, if they have the testimony of their own consciences. But he complains, that he found little pleasure in his work. Some good people lose much of the pleasantness of religion by the fretfulness and uneasiness of their natural temper, which they indulge. The Lord called the prophet to cease from his distrust, and to return to his work. If he attended thereto, he might be assured the Lord would deliver him from his enemies. Those who are with God, and faithful to him, he will deliver from trouble or carry through it.

So the doctrines of the Gospel, which are the words of God, and not of men, when by searching and close application they are found in the Scriptures, and under the ministry of the word, they are food to souls, sweet, savoury, wholesome, nourishing, and strengthening; not as merely heard externally, or only assented unto, or superficially tasted of; but when eaten, as Ezekiel's roll was by him; and which is done by faith, which receives, feeds upon, and digests the word; for, unless it is mixed with faith, it is not profitable: <p>and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart; the messages which the prophet was sent with, even those which denounced grievous things against his people in case of impenitence, were gladly received by him, and he readily delivered them, hoping that they would be a means of bringing them to a sense of their sins, and to repentance for them, and so of preserving them from ruin; and especially those words or doctrines he had in commission to deliver, which respected the Messiah, his person, offices, kingdom, righteousness, and grace; the calling of the Gentiles, and the enlargement of the interest of Christ; the glory of his name, and the prosperity of his people in the latter day. The word of the Gospel, when received and eaten by faith, whether by ministers or people, is productive of spiritual joy and pleasure; the promises of it being exceeding precious; and the doctrines of it doctrines of grace, salvation, peace, pardon, and righteousness, by Christ, who is the sum and substance of them: <p>for I am called by thy name, O Lord God of hosts; what added to his joy was, that the name of the Lord was called upon him, or that he was called a prophet of the Lord: this he looked upon as a high honour done him; and what still more increased his joy was, that he was a prophet, not of Baal, that could not hear nor help his prophets and worshippers; but of the Lord God of hosts and armies, who was able to uphold him, protect and defend him, against his enemies. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/15.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Thy words were found, and I <span class="cverse3">{p}</span> ate them; and thy word was to me the joy and rejoicing of my heart: for I am called by thy name, O LORD God of hosts.</span><p>(p) I received them with a great joy, as he that is famished eats meat.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/15.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">16</span>.

Jeremiah here describes his first reception of a Divine revelation. Truth is like "treasure hid in a field;" he alone who seeks it with an unprejudiced mind can "find" it. But there are some things which no "searching" of the intellect can "find" (<a href="/job/11-7.htm">Job 11:7</a>; <a href="/job/37-23.htm">Job 37:23</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:11</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/8-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:17</a>); yet by a special revelation they may be "found" by God's "spokesmen," or prophets. This is the train of thought which underlies Jeremiah's expression here. The "words," or revelations, of Jehovah are regarded as having an objective existence in the ideal world of which God is the light, and as "descending" from thence (comp. <a href="/isaiah/9-8.htm">Isaiah 9:8</a>) into the consciousness of the prophet. So <a href="/ezekiel/3-1.htm">Ezekiel 3:1</a>, "Eat that thou findest." <span class="cmt_word">I did eat them</span>; I assimilated them, as it were (comp. <a href="/ezekiel/2-8.htm">Ezekiel 2:8</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/3-3.htm">Ezekiel 3:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I am called by thy name</span>; literally, <span class="accented">thy name hath been</span> (or, <span class="accented">had been</span>) <span class="accented">called upon me</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> I have (or, had) been specially dedicated to thy service. The phrase is often used of Israel (see on Jeremiah 14:9), and, as here applied, intimates that a faithful prophet was, as it were, the embodied ideal of an Israelite. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Complaint of the Prophet, and Soothing Answer of the Lord. - His sorrow at the rejection by God of his petition so overcomes the prophet, that he gives utterance to the wish: he had rather not have been born than live on in the calling in which he must ever foretell misery and ruin to his people, thereby provoking hatred and attacks, while his heart is like to break for grief and fellow-feeling; whereupon the Lord reprovingly replies as in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-11.htm">Jeremiah 15:11-14</a>.<p><a href="/jeremiah/15-10.htm">Jeremiah 15:10</a><p>"Woe is me, my mother, that thou hast born me, a man of strive and contention to all the earth! I have not lent out, nor have men lent to me; all curse me. <a href="/jeremiah/15-11.htm">Jeremiah 15:11</a>. Jahveh saith, Verily I strengthen thee to thy good; verily I cause the enemy to entreat thee in the time of evil and of trouble. <a href="/jeremiah/15-12.htm">Jeremiah 15:12</a>.

And cause thine enemies bring it into a land which thou knowest not; for fire burneth in mine anger, against you it is kindled."<p>Woe is me, exclaims Jeremiah in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-10.htm">Jeremiah 15:10</a>, that my mother brought me forth! The apostrophe to his mother is significant of the depth of his sorrow, and is not to be understood as if he were casting any reproach on his mother; it is an appeal to his mother to share with him his sorrow at his lot. This lament is consequently very different from Job's cursing of the day of his birth, <a href="/job/3-1.htm">Job 3:1</a>. The apposition to the suffix "me," the man of strife and contention, conveys the meaning of the lament in this wise: me, who must yet be a man, with whom the whole world strives and contends. Ew. wrongly render it: "to be a man of strife," etc.; for it was not his mother's fault that he became such an one. The second clause intimates that he has not provoked the strife and contention. &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;, lend, i.e., give on loan, and with &#1489;&#1468;, to lend to a person, lend out; hence &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;, debtor, and &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; &#1489;&#1493;, creditor, <a href="/isaiah/24-2.htm">Isaiah 24:2</a>. These words are not an individualizing of the thought: all interchange of friendly services between me and human society is broken off (Hitz.). For intercourse with one's fellow-men does not chiefly, or in the foremost place, consist in lending and borrowing of gold and other articles. Borrowing and lending is rather the frequent occasion of strife and ill-will; <p>(Note: Calvin aptly remarks: Unde enim inter homines et lites et jurgia, nisi quia male inter ipsos convenit, dum ultro et citro negotiantur?)<p>and it is in this reference that it is here brought up. Jeremiah says he has neither as bad debtor or disobliging creditor given occasion to hatred and quarrelling, and yet all curse him. This is the meaning of the last words, in which the form &#1502;&#1511;&#1500;&#1500;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497; is hard to explain. The rabbinical attempts to clear it up by means of a commingling of the verbs &#1511;&#1500;&#1500; and &#1511;&#1500;&#1492; are now, and reasonably, given up. Ew. (Gram. 350, c) wants to make it &#1502;&#1511;&#1500;&#1500;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497;; but probably the form has arisen merely out of the wrong dividing of a word, and ought to be read &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;&#1501; &#1511;&#1500;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;. So read most recent scholars, after the example of J. D. Mich.; cf. also Bttcher, Grammat. ii. S. 322, note. It is true that we nowhere else find &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;&#1501;; but we find an analogy in the archaic &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;&#1501; . In its favour we have, besides, the circumstance, that the heavy form &#1492;&#1501; is by preference appended to short words; see Bttcher, as above, S. 21.</body></html>
