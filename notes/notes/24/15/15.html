Jeremiah pleads with God for mercy and relief against his enemies, persecutors, and slanderers. It will be a comfort to God's ministers, when men despise them, if they have the testimony of their own consciences. But he complains, that he found little pleasure in his work. Some good people lose much of the pleasantness of religion by the fretfulness and uneasiness of their natural temper, which they indulge. The Lord called the prophet to cease from his distrust, and to return to his work. If he attended thereto, he might be assured the Lord would deliver him from his enemies. Those who are with God, and faithful to him, he will deliver from trouble or carry through it.

"Sand of the sea" is the figure for a countless number. &#1497;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; is poetic plural; cf. <a href="/psalms/78-27.htm">Psalm 78:27</a>; <a href="/job/6-3.htm">Job 6:3</a>. On these defenceless women come suddenly spoilers, and these mothers who had perhaps borne seven sons give up the ghost and perish without succour, because their sons have fallen in war. Thus proceeds the portrayal as Hitz. has well exhibited it. &#1506;&#1500; &#1488;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; is variously interpreted. We must reject the view taken by Chr. B. Mich. from the Syr. and Arab. versions: upon mother and young man; as also the view of Rashi, Cler., Eichh., Dahl., etc., that &#1488;&#1501; means the mother-city, i.e., Jerusalem. The true rendering is that of Jerome and Kimchi, who have been followed by J. D. Mich., Hitz., Ew., Graf, and Ng.: upon the mother of the youth or young warrior. This view is favoured by the correspondence of the woman mentioned in <a href="/job/6-9.htm">Job 6:9</a> who had borne seven sons. Both are individualized as women of full bodily vigour, to lend vividness to the thought that no age and no sex will escape destruction &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1468;&#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, at clear noontide, when one least looks for an attack. Thus the word corresponds with the "suddenly" of the next clause. &#1506;&#1497;&#1512;, Aramaic form for &#1510;&#1497;&#1512;, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/13-8.htm">Isaiah 13:8</a>, pangs. The bearer of seven, i.e., the mother of many sons. Seven as the perfect number of children given in blessing by God, cf. <a href="/1_samuel/2-5.htm">1 Samuel 2:5</a>; <a href="/ruth/4-15.htm">Ruth 4:15</a>. "She breathes to her life," cf. <a href="/job/31-39.htm">Job 31:39</a>. Graf wrongly: she sighs. The sun of her life sets (&#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1492;) while it is still day, before the evening of her life has been reached, cf. <a href="/amos/8-9.htm">Amos 8:9</a>. "Is put to shame and confounded" is not to be referred to the son, but the mother, who, bereaved of her children, goes covered with shame to the grave. The Keri &#1489;&#1468;&#1488; for &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1492; is an unnecessary change, since &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473; is also construed as fem., <a href="/genesis/15-17.htm">Genesis 15:17</a>. The description closes with a glance cast on those left in life after the overthrow of Jerusalem. These are to be given to the sword when in flight before their enemies, cf. <a href="/micah/6-14.htm">Micah 6:14</a>. </body></html>
