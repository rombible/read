Josiah was prevented from seeing the evil to come in this world, and removed to see the good to come in the other world; therefore, weep not for him, but for his son Shallum, who is likely to live and die a wretched captive. Dying saints may be justly envied, while living sinners are justly pitied. Here also is the doom of Jehoiakim. No doubt it is lawful for princes and great men to build, beautify, and furnish houses; but those who enlarge their houses, and make them sumptuous, need carefully to watch against the workings of vain-glory. He built his houses by unrighteousness, with money gotten unjustly. And he defrauded his workmen of their wages. God notices the wrong done by the greatest to poor servants and labourers, and will repay those in justice, who will not, in justice, pay those whom they employ. The greatest of men must look upon the meanest as their neighbours, and be just to them accordingly. Jehoiakim was unjust, and made no conscience of shedding innocent blood. Covetousness, which is the root of all evil, was at the bottom of all. The children who despise their parents' old fashions, commonly come short of their real excellences. Jehoiakim knew that his father found the way of duty to be the way of comfort, yet he would not tread in his steps. He shall die unlamented, hateful for oppression and cruelty.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Large chambers - spacious upper chambers.<p>It is cieled - Or, roofing it.<p>Vermilion - The pigment which gives the deep red color still bright and untarnished on many ancient buildings. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. wide&#8212;literally, "a house of dimensions" ("measures").

But the word is rather an adjective; "he cutteth it (the house) out for himself, so as to be full of windows." The following words accord with this construction, "and (he makes it) ceiled with cedar," &c. [Maurer]. Retaining English Version, there must be understood something remarkable about the windows, since they are deemed worthy of notice.

Or, "a house of measures", or, "dimensions" (i); a very large house, whose length and breadth measure much consisting of many spacious rooms, upper as well as lower; as follows: <p>and large chambers; or, "widened ones"; very spacious and roomy; or "aired", or "airy (k) ones"; through which the wind blows, or into which much air comes; so that they were good summer chambers, for which they might be built: <p>and cutteth him out windows; to let in light and air, as well as for ornament. Some render it, "and teareth my windows" (l); as if he had taken some of the windows of the temple, and placed them in his palace, and so was guilty of sacrilege; but this is not very likely: <p>and it is ceiled with cedar; wainscotted with it; or the roof of it was covered with cedar, as Jarchi; or its beams and rafters were made of cedar, as Kimchi; it might be lined throughout with cedar: <p>and painted with vermilion. The Vulgate Latin version renders it, "sinopis"; so called from Sinope, a city in Pontus, where it is found; of which Pliny says (m) there are three sorts, one red, another reddish, and a third between them both: this is the same with "minium" or vermilion. Strabo (n) says, in Cappadocia the best Sinopic minium or vermilion is produced, and which vies with that of Spain; and he says it is called sinopic, because the merchants used to bring it to that place (Sinope) before the commerce of the Ephesians reached the men of this country, Cappadocia; other versions (o), besides the Vulgate Latin, so render it here. Schindler (p) renders the Hebrew word by this; and also by "cinnabar", which is a red mineral stone, and chiefly found in quicksilver mines; and may be thought to be quicksilver petrified, and fixed by means of sulphur, and a subterraneous heat; for artificial cinnabar is made of a mixture of mercury and sulphur sublimed, and reduced into a kind of fine red glebe; and this is called by the painters vermilion; and is made more beautiful by grinding it with gum water, and a little saffron; which two drugs prevent its growing black: and there are two kinds of vermilion; the one natural, which is found in some silver mines, in form of a ruddy sand, of a bright beautiful red colour; the other is made of artificial cinnabar, ground up with white wine, and afterwards with the whites of eggs. There are two sorts of it that we have; the one of a deep red; the other pale; but are the same; the difference of colour only proceeding from the cinnabar's being more or less ground; when fine ground, the vermilion is pale, and is preferred to the coarser and redder. It is of considerable use among painters in oil and miniature (q); and here it may be rendered, "anointed with minium" or "vermilion" (r); but it is questionable whether this vermilion was known so early. Kimchi here says, it is the same which the Arabians call "zingapher", or cinnabar. The Hebrew word is "shashar", which Junius and Tremellius translate "indico" (s); and observe from Pliny (t), that there is a people in India called Sasuri, from whence it is brought; but this is of a different colour from minium or vermilion; the one is blue, the other red; but, be it which it will, the painting was for ornament; and either colours look beautiful. <p>(i)  "domum mensurarum", Vatablus, Montanus, Calvin, Schmidt.

The prophet could go down only from the temple; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/36-12.htm">Jeremiah 36:12</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/26-10.htm">Jeremiah 26:10</a>. Not only the king is to hear the word of the Lord, but his servants too, and the people, who go in by these gates, the gates of the royal castle. The exhortation: to do right and justice, etc., is only an expansion of the brief counsel at <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-12.htm">Jeremiah 21:12</a>, and that brought home to the heart of the whole people in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-6.htm">Jeremiah 7:6</a>, cf. <a href="/ezekiel/22-6.htm">Ezekiel 22:6</a>.

"This house" is the royal palace. &#1500;&#1495;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492; as in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-34.htm">Jeremiah 7:34</a>, cf. <a href="/jeremiah/27-17.htm">Jeremiah 27:17</a>. The threatening is illustrated in <a href="/jeremiah/22-6.htm">Jeremiah 22:6</a> by further description of the destruction of the palace. The royal castle is addressed, and, in respect of its lofty situation and magnificence, is called a Gilead and a head of Lebanon. It lay on the north-eastern eminence of Mount Zion (see on <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/7-12.htm">1 Kings 7:12</a>, note 1), and contained the so-called forest-house of Lebanon (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/7-2.htm">1 Kings 7:2-5</a>) and various other buildings built of cedar, or, at least, faced with cedar planks (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-14.htm">Jeremiah 22:14</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/22-23.htm">Jeremiah 22:23</a>); so that the entire building might be compared to a forest of cedars on the summit of Lebanon. In the comparison to Gilead, Gilead can hardly be adduced in respect of its great fertility as a pasturing land (<a href="/numbers/32-1.htm">Numbers 32:1</a>; <a href="/micah/7-14.htm">Micah 7:14</a>), but in virtue of the thickly wooded covering of the hill-country of Gilead on both sides of the Jabbok. This is still in great measure clothed with oak thickets and, according to Buckingham, the most beautiful forest tracts that can be imagined; cf. C. v. Raumer, Pal. S. 82.<p>(Note: In 1834 Eli Smith travelled through it, and thus writes: "Jebel 'Ajlun presents the most charming rural scenery that I have seen in Syria. A continued forest of noble trees, chiefly the evergreen oak, covers a large part of it, while the ground beneath is clothed with luxuriant grass and decked with a rich variety of wild flowers. As we went from el-Husn to 'Ajlun our path lay along the summit of the mountain; and we often overlooked a large part of Palestine on one side and the whole of Haurn." - Rob. Phys. Geog. p. 54.)<p>&#1488;&#1501; &#1500;&#1488; is a particle of asseveration. This glorious forest of cedar buildings is to become a &#1502;&#1491;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;, a treeless steppe, cities uninhabited. "Cities" refers to the thing compared, not to the emblem; and the plural, as being the form for indefinite generality, presents no difficulty. And the attachment thereto of a singular predicate has many analogies in its support, cf. Ew. 317, a. The Keri &#1504;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468; is an uncalled for emendation of the Chet. &#1504;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1492;, cf. <a href="/jeremiah/6-5.htm">Jeremiah 6:5</a>. - "I consecrate," in respect that the destroyers are warriors whom God sends as the executors of His will, see on <a href="/jeremiah/6-4.htm">Jeremiah 6:4</a>. With "a man and his weapons," cf. <a href="/ezekiel/9-2.htm">Ezekiel 9:2</a>. In keeping with the figure of a forest, the destruction is represented as the hewing down of the choicest cedars; cf. <a href="/isaiah/10-34.htm">Isaiah 10:34</a>. - Thus is to be accomplished in Jerusalem what Moses threatened, <a href="/deuteronomy/29-23.htm">Deuteronomy 29:23</a>; the destroyed city will become a monument of God's wrath against the transgressors of His covenant. <a href="/jeremiah/22-8.htm">Jeremiah 22:8</a> is modelled upon <a href="/deuteronomy/29-23.htm">Deuteronomy 29:23</a>., cf. <a href="/1_kings/9-8.htm">1 Kings 9:8</a>., and made to bear upon Jerusalem, since, along with the palace, the city too is destroyed by the enemy.<p>From <a href="/jeremiah/22-10.htm">Jeremiah 22:10</a> onwards the exhortation to the evil shepherds becomes a prophecy concerning the kings of that time, who by their godless courses hurried on the threatened destruction. The prophecy begins with King Jehoahaz, who, after a reign of three months, had bee discrowned by Pharaoh Necho and carried captive to Egypt; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/23-30.htm">2 Kings 23:30-35</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-1.htm">2 Chronicles 36:1-4</a>. </body></html>
