Time was when he was delighted in; but all those in whom God has no pleasure, some time or other, will be so lowered, that men will have no pleasure in them. Whoever are childless, it is the Lord that writes them so; and those who take no care to do good in their days, cannot expect to prosper.

O earth! earth! earth!&#8212;Jeconiah was not actually without offspring (compare Jer 22:28, "his seed"; 1Ch 3:17, 18; Mt 1:12), but he was to be "written childless," as a warning to posterity, that is, without a lineal heir to his throne. It is with a reference to the three kings, Shallum, Jehoiakim, and Jeconiah, that the earth is thrice invoked [Bengel]. Or, the triple invocation is to give intensity to the call for attention to the announcement of the end of the royal line, so far as Jehoiachin's seed is concerned. Though Messiah (Mt 1:1-17), the heir of David's throne, was lineally descended from Jeconiah, it was only through Joseph, who, though His legal, was not His real father. Matthew gives the legal pedigree through Solomon down to Joseph; Luke the real pedigree, from Mary, the real parent, through Nathan, brother of Solomon, upwards (Lu 3:31).<p>no man of his seed &#8230; upon the throne&#8212;This explains the sense in which "childless" is used. Though the succession to the throne failed in his line, still the promise to David (Ps 89:30-37) was revived in Zerubbabel and consummated in Christ.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/22.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The word translated <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">childless</span> is but thrice read in holy writ, and by various interpreters translated <span class="ital">barren, not increasing, empty, full of sorrow, wanting children</span>, &c.

That is, Coniah, or Jeconiah; who though he had children in the captivity, yet they died in it, or however never succeeded him in the throne. This, to show the certainty of the thing, the Lord would have written. The speech is directed, as some think, to the angels, or to the prophets; though the words may be rendered impersonally, "let this man be written childless", it may be set down, and taken for a sure and certain thing, as though it was written with a pen of iron, that he shall be alone, and die without children, and have none to reign after him; <p>a man that shall not prosper in his days; he sat but three months and ten days upon the throne, and all the rest of his days he lived in captivity, <a href="/2_chronicles/36-9.htm">2 Chronicles 36:9</a>; so that he was a very unfortunate prince; <p>for no man of his seed shall prosper, sitting on the throne of David,  <p>and ruling any more in Judah; none of them were so prosperous and happy as to arrive to the royal dignity, or to sit on the throne of David, and be kings of Judah.

The names Jeconjahu and abbreviated Jeconjah are equivalent to Jojachin and Jehojachin, i.e., Jahveh will establish. Jeconjah was doubtless his original name, and so stands in the family register, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-16.htm">1 Chronicles 3:16</a>, but was at his accession to the throne changed into Jehojachin or Jojachin, to make it liker his father's name. The abbreviation of Jeconjahu into Conjahu is held by Hgstb. Christol. ii. p. 402, to be a change made by Jeremiah in order by cutting off the y (will establish) to cut off the hope expressed by the name, to make "a Jeconiah without the J, a 'God will establish' without the will." For two reasons we cannot adopt this as the true view: 1. The general reason, that if Jeremiah had wished to adumbrate the fate of the three kings (Jehoahaz, Jehoiakim, and Jehoiachin) by making changes in their names, he would then have changed the name of Jehoiakim in like manner as he did that of Jehoahaz into Shallum, and that of Jehoiachin into Conjahu. The argument by which Hgstb. seeks to justify the exception in the one case will not hold its own. Had Jeremiah thought it unseemly to practise a kind of conceit, for however solemn a purpose, on the name of the then reigning monarch, then neither could he have ventured on the like in the case of Jehoiachin; for the present prediction was not, as Hgstb. assumed, uttered before his accession, but, as may be seen from the title king of Judah, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-24.htm">Jeremiah 22:24</a>, after he had ascended the throne, was actually king. Besides. 2. the name Conjahu occurs also at <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-1.htm">Jeremiah 37:1</a>, in a historical heading, as of equal dignity with Jeconjahu, <a href="/jeremiah/29-2.htm">Jeremiah 29:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/28-4.htm">Jeremiah 28:4</a>, etc., where a name proper only to prophetic discourse would not have been in place. The passages in which the prophets express the character and destiny of a person in a name specially formed for the purpose, are of another kind. There we have always: they shall call his name, or: his name shall be; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/33-16.htm">Jeremiah 33:16</a>; <a href="/isaiah/9-5.htm">Isaiah 9:5</a>; <a href="/isaiah/62-4.htm">Isaiah 62:4</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/48-35.htm">Ezekiel 48:35</a>. That the name Jeconjah has not merely the prophet's authority, is vouched for by <a href="/1_chronicles/3-15.htm">1 Chronicles 3:15</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/esther/2-6.htm">Esther 2:6</a>, and by the historical notices, <a href="/jeremiah/24-1.htm">Jeremiah 24:1</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/27-20.htm">Jeremiah 27:20</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/28-4.htm">Jeremiah 28:4</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/29-2.htm">Jeremiah 29:2</a>. And the occurrence of the name Jojachin only in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/24.htm">2 Kings 24</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/36-1.htm">2 Chronicles 36:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-31.htm">Jeremiah 52:31</a>, and <a href="/ezekiel/1-2.htm">Ezekiel 1:2</a> is in consequence of the original documents used by the authors of these books, where, so to speak, the official names were made use of; whereas Jeremiah preferred the proper, original name which the man bore as the prince-royal and son of Jehoiakim, and which was therefore the current and best known one.<p>The utterance concerning Jechoniah is more distinct and decided than that concerning Jehoiakim. With a solemn oath the Lord not only causes to be made known to him that he is to be cast off and taken into exile, but further, that his descendants are debarred from the throne for ever. Nothing is said of his own conduct towards the Lord. In <a href="/2_kings/24-9.htm">2 Kings 24:9</a> and <a href="/2_chronicles/36-9.htm">2 Chronicles 36:9</a> it is said of him that he did that which was displeasing to the Lord, even as his father had done. Ezekiel confirms this sentence when in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/19-5.htm">Ezekiel 19:5-9</a> he portrays him as a young lion that devoured men, forced widows, and laid cities waste. The words of Jahveh: Although Conjahu were a signet ring on my right hand, convey no judgment as to his character, but simply mean: Although he were as precious a jewel in the Lord's eyes as a signet ring (cf. <a href="/haggai/2-23.htm">Haggai 2:23</a>), the Lord would nevertheless cast him away. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; before &#1488;&#1501; introduces the body of the oath, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-5.htm">Jeremiah 22:5</a>, and is for rhetorical effect repeated before the apodosis, as in <a href="/2_samuel/3-9.htm">2 Samuel 3:9</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-27.htm">2 Samuel 2:27</a>, etc. Although he were, sc. what he is not; not: although he is (Graf); for there is no proof for the remark: that as being the prince set by Jahveh over His people, he has really as close a connection with Him. Hitz.'s explanation is also erroneous: "even if, seeking help, he were to cling so closely to me as a ring does to the finger." A most unnatural figure, not supported by reference to Sol 8:6. As to &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1504;&#1498;&#1468;, from &#1504;&#1514;&#1511; with &#1503; epenth., cf. Ew. 250, b. - From <a href="/jeremiah/22-25.htm">Jeremiah 22:25</a> on, the discourse is addressed directly to Jechoniah, to make his rejection known to him. God will deliver him into the hand of his enemies, whom he fears, namely, into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar and the Chaldeans, and cast him with his mother into a strange land, where he shall die. The mother was called Nehushta, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/24-8.htm">2 Kings 24:8</a>, and is brought forward in 29:2 as &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1512;&#1492;.

The construction &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;  is like that of &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1508;&#1503; &#1504;&#1499;&#1512;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, <a href="/jeremiah/2-21.htm">Jeremiah 2:21</a>; and the absence of the article from &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1514; is no sufficient reason for holding it to be a gloss (Hitz.), or for taking the article in &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; to be a slip caused by &#1506;&#1500; &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, <a href="/jeremiah/22-27.htm">Jeremiah 22:27</a>. To lift up their souls, i.e., to direct their longings, wishes, towards a thing, cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/24-15.htm">Deuteronomy 24:15</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/4-8.htm">Hosea 4:8</a>, etc. - The further sentence on Jechoniah was not pronounced after he had been carried captive, as Ng. infers from the perfects &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1496;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; and &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;. The perfects are prophetic. The question: Is this man a vessel despised and to be broken (&#1506;&#1510;&#1489;, vas fictile)? is an expression of sympathising regret on the part of the prophet for the unhappy fate of the king; but we may not hence conclude that Jeremiah regarded him as better than his father. The prophet's sympathy for his fate regarded less the person of the unfortunate king than it did the fortunes of David's royal seed, in that, of Jechoniah's sons, none was to sit on the throne of David (<a href="/jeremiah/22-30.htm">Jeremiah 22:30</a>). Ew. has excellently paraphrased the sense: "Although there is many a sympathising heart in the land that bitterly laments the hard fate of the dear young king, who along with his infant children has been (? will be) dragged away, yet it is God's unchangeable decree that neither he nor any of his sons shall ascend the throne of David." &#1504;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509;, not: broken, but: that shall be broken (cf. Ew. 335, b). Wherefore are they - he and his seed - cast out? At his accession Jehoiachin was eighteen years old, not eight, as by an error stands in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-9.htm">2 Chronicles 36:9</a>, see on <a href="/2_kings/24-8.htm">2 Kings 24:8</a>; so that when taken captive, he might well enough have children, or at least one son, since his wives are expressly mentioned in the account of the captivity, <a href="/2_kings/24-15.htm">2 Kings 24:15</a>. That the sons mentioned in <a href="/1_chronicles/3-16.htm">1 Chronicles 3:16</a> and <a href="/1_chronicles/3-17.htm">1 Chronicles 3:17</a> were born to him in exile, cannot be inferred from that passage, rightly understood, see on that passage. The fact that no sons are mentioned in connection with the carrying captive is simply explained by the fact that they were still infants. </body></html>
