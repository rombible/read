Very haughty in a day of peace and safety. Very fearful on alarm of trouble. Very much cast down under pressure of trouble. Many never are ashamed of their sins till brought by them to the last extremity. The king shall close his days in bondage. Those that think themselves as signets on God's right hand, must not be secure, but fear lest they should be plucked thence. The Jewish king and his family shall be carried to Babylon. We know where we were born, but where we shall die we know not; it is enough that our God knows. Let it be our care that we die in Christ, then it will be well with us wherever we die, thought it may be in a far country. The Jewish king shall be despised. Time was when he was delighted in; but all those in whom God has no pleasure, some time or other, will be so lowered, that men will have no pleasure in them. Whoever are childless, it is the Lord that writes them so; and those who take no care to do good in their days, cannot expect to prosper. How little is earthly grandeur to be depended upon, or flourishing families to be rejoiced in! But those who hear the voice of Christ, and follow him, have eternal life, and shall never perish, neither shall any enemy pluck them out of his almighty hands.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The words "king of Judah," belong to Coniah, and prove that he was king regnant when the prophet wrote.

To have an ass's burial means: to be left unburied in the open field, or cast into a flaying-ground, inasmuch as they drag out the dead body and cast it far from the gates of Jerusalem. The words: Alas, my brother! alas, etc.! are ipsissima verba of the regular mourners who were procured to bewail the deaths of men and women. The lxx took objection to the "alas, sister," and left it out, applying the words literally to Jehoiakim's death; whereas the words are but a rhetorical individualizing of the general idea: they will make no death-laments for him, and the omission destroys the parallelism. His glory, i.e., the king's. The idea is: neither his relatives nor his subjects will lament his death. The infinn. absoll. &#1505;&#1495;&#1493;&#1489; &#1493;&#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1498;, dragging forth and casting (him), serve to explain: the burial of an ass, etc. In <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-30.htm">Jeremiah 36:30</a>, where Jeremiah repeats this prediction concerning Jehoiakim, it is said: His dead body shall be cast out (exposed) to the heat by day and to the cold by night, i.e., rot unburied under the open sky.<p>As to the fulfilment of this prophecy, we are told, indeed, in <a href="/2_kings/24-6.htm">2 Kings 24:6</a> that Jehoiakim slept with his fathers, and Jehoiachin, his son, was king in his stead. But the phrase "to sleep with his fathers" denotes merely departure from this life, without saying anything as to the manner of the death. It is not used only of kings who died a peaceful death on a sickbed, but of Ahab (<a href="/1_kings/22-40.htm">1 Kings 22:40</a>), who, mortally wounded in the battle, died in the war-chariot. There is no record of Jehoiakim's funeral obsequies or burial in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/24.htm">2 Kings 24</a>, and in Chr. there is not even mention made of his death. Three years after the first siege of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans, and after he had become tributary to the king of Babylon, Jehoiakim rose in insurrection, and Nebuchadnezzar sent against him the troops of the Chaldeans, Aramaeans, Moabites, and Ammonites. It was not till after the accession of Jehoiachin that Nebuchadnezzar himself appeared before Jerusalem and besieged it (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/24-1.htm">2 Kings 24:1-2</a>, and <a href="/2_kings/24-10.htm">2 Kings 24:10</a>). So it is in the highest degree probable that Jehoiakim fell in battle against the Chaldean-Syrian armies before Jerusalem was besieged, and while the enemies were advancing against the city; also that he was left to lie unburied outside of Jerusalem; see on <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/24-6.htm">2 Kings 24:6</a>, where other untenable attempts to harmonize are discussed. The absence of direct testimony to the fulfilment of the prophecy before us can be no ground for doubting that it was fulfilled, when we consider the great brevity of the notices of the last kings' reigns given by the authors of the books of Kings and Chronicles. Graf's remark hereon is excellent: "We have a warrant for the fulfilment of this prediction precisely in the fact that it is again expressly recounted in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/36.htm">Jeremiah 36</a>, a historical passage written certainly at a later time (<a href="/jeremiah/36-30.htm">Jeremiah 36:30</a> seems to contain but a slight reference to the prediction in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-18.htm">Jeremiah 22:18-19</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/22-30.htm">Jeremiah 22:30</a>); or, while <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-12.htm">Jeremiah 22:12</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/22-25.htm">Jeremiah 22:25</a>. tallies so completely with the history, is <a href="/jeremiah/22-18.htm">Jeremiah 22:18</a>. to be held as contradicting it?" </body></html>
