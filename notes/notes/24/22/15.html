A various reading, followed by the LXX., gives, “thou viest with Ahaz,” or “Ahab,” probably, in this latter case, with reference to the ivory palace built by that king (<a href="/1_kings/22-39.htm" title="Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he made, and all the cities that he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?">1Kings 22:39</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Did not thy father eat and drink . . .?</span>—The words are obviously those of praise, and paint a healthy, blameless enjoyment like that of <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-24.htm" title="There is nothing better for a man, than that he should eat and drink, and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labor.

But wisdom is justified of her children.">Matthew 11:19</a>). Josiah was not an ascetic, devotee king, but lived his life happily, and did his work—the true kingly work of judgment and justice—well. There was a truer greatness in that than in the stateliness of Jehoiakim’s palaces. “Then it was well with him” s repeated with the emphasis of iteration.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/22.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>22:10-19 Here is a sentence of death upon two kings, the wicked sons of a very pious father. Josiah was prevented from seeing the evil to come in this world, and removed to see the good to come in the other world; therefore, weep not for him, but for his son Shallum, who is likely to live and die a wretched captive. Dying saints may be justly envied, while living sinners are justly pitied. Here also is the doom of Jehoiakim. No doubt it is lawful for princes and great men to build, beautify, and furnish houses; but those who enlarge their houses, and make them sumptuous, need carefully to watch against the workings of vain-glory. He built his houses by unrighteousness, with money gotten unjustly. And he defrauded his workmen of their wages. God notices the wrong done by the greatest to poor servants and labourers, and will repay those in justice, who will not, in justice, pay those whom they employ. The greatest of men must look upon the meanest as their neighbours, and be just to them accordingly. Jehoiakim was unjust, and made no conscience of shedding innocent blood. Covetousness, which is the root of all evil, was at the bottom of all. The children who despise their parents' old fashions, commonly come short of their real excellences. Jehoiakim knew that his father found the way of duty to be the way of comfort, yet he would not tread in his steps. He shall die unlamented, hateful for oppression and cruelty.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>i. e., Will thy buildings make thy reign continue? These words imply that Jehoiakim was looking forward to, and taking measures to secure, a long continuance of power (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-9.htm">Habakkuk 2:9-13</a>. If so, Jeremiah probably wrote this prophecy before Jehoiakim revolted <a href="/2_kings/24-1.htm">2 Kings 24:1</a>; and it, therefore, probably belongs to the same date as <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-30.htm">Jeremiah 36:30</a>, written in the interval between Nebuchadnezzars first conquest of Jerusalem, and Jehoiakim's rebellion, and when Jeremiah was out of the reach of the tyrant's power.<p>Closest thyself in cedar - Rather, viest "in cedar;" i. e., viest with Solomon.<p>Did not thy father eat and drink ... - i. e., he was prosperous and enjoyed life.

The Targum is, <p>"dost thou think to be as the first king?'' <p>as David; to be as great a prince, to keep as grand a court, and live in as splendid a manner, as he? The Septuagint version, instead of "ares", a cedar, reads "Ahaz", and takes it for the proper name of a king of Judah; and the Arabic version reads "Ahab"; and so the Alexandrian copy of the Septuagint; and both confound it with the next clause; the former rendering the words thus, "shalt thou reign, that thou provokest in", or "after the manner of Ahaz thy father?" and the latter thus, <p>"thou shalt not reign, because thou imitatest the original of Ahab thy father;'' <p>but both wrong; though Grotius seems to approve of this reading: <p>did not thy father eat and drink, and do judgment and justice? that is, Josiah his father, who ate and drank in moderation, and lived cheerfully and comfortably; and kept a good table like a prince, without such a magnificent palace as he, his son, had built; and without oppressing his subjects, and detaining the hire of the labourer: living in a grand manner, becoming a king, may be done consistent with doing justice and judgment; let but that be done, and a prince will not be blamed for living like himself, and for supporting the dignity of his character and office, as Josiah did: <p>and then it was well with him; or, "therefore it was well with him" (u) he was blessed of God, and was prosperous and successful; he was happy himself as a prince, and his people under him, both enjoying peace and prosperity; there are never better times than when justice is done; by it the throne is established. <p>(u)   "ideo bene fuit ei"; so Noldius renders the particle, Concord.

The second part of the clause must at any rate be. altered. Some render, "because thou viest (with thy forefathers) in cedar" (i.e. in building cedar palaces). Hitzig would strike out "in cedar," as having intruded from the preceding line (such a phenomenon meets us occasionally in the received Hebrew text), but this does not help us to a 'connected translation of the passage. Graf's rendering is grammatical, and not against usage; it is, "Dost thou reign because thou art eager about cedar-wood?" and yet the impression left on the mind is that there is some error in the text. The Septuagint finds a reference to one of Jehoiakim's predecessors, "because thou viest with Ahaz" (so the Vatican Codex), or, "... with Ahab" (so the Alexandrine and the Sinaitic or Friderico-Augustan). The latter king is celebrated in the Old Testament on account of his buildings, especially his ivory palace (<a href="/2_kings/22.htm">2 Kings 22</a>:39). The former was at any rate addicted to the imitation of foreign ways (<a href="/2_kings/16-11.htm">2 Kings 16:11</a>; <a href="/2_kings/20-11.htm">2 Kings 20:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Did not thy father eat and drink?</span> There was no call upon Jehoiakim to live the life of a Nazarite. "Eating and drinking," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> enjoying the good things within his reach, was perfectly admissible (<a href="/ecclesiastes/2-24.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:24</a>); indeed, the Old Testament view of life is remarkable for its healthy naturalness. There was, however, one peremptory condition, itself as much in accordance with nature as with the Law of God, that the rights of other men should be studiously regarded. Josiah "ate and drank," but he also "did judgment and justice," and so "it was well with him." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/22.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The king is warned against injustice, and the violent oppression of the poor and defenceless. - <a href="/jeremiah/22-1.htm">Jeremiah 22:1</a>. "Thus said Jahveh: Go down to the house of the king of Judah and speak there this word, <a href="/jeremiah/22-2.htm">Jeremiah 22:2</a>. And say: Hear the word of Jahveh, thou king of Judah, that sittest upon the throne of David, thou, and thy servants, and thy people, that go in by these gates. <a href="/jeremiah/22-3.htm">Jeremiah 22:3</a>. Thus hath Jahveh said: Do ye right and justice, and save the despoiled out of the hand of the oppressor; to stranger, orphan, and widow do no wrong, no violence; and innocent blood shed not in this place. <a href="/jeremiah/22-4.htm">Jeremiah 22:4</a>.

But if ye hearken not to these words, by myself have I sworn, saith Jahve, that this house shall become a desolation. <a href="/jeremiah/22-6.htm">Jeremiah 22:6</a>. For thus hath Jahveh said concerning the house of the king of Judah: A Gilead art thou to me, a head of Lebanon; surely I will make thee a wilderness, cities uninhabited; <a href="/jeremiah/22-7.htm">Jeremiah 22:7</a>. And will consecrate against thee destroyers, each with his tools, who shall hew down the choice of thy cedars and cast them into the fire. <a href="/jeremiah/22-8.htm">Jeremiah 22:8</a>. And there shall pass may peoples by this city, and one shall say to the other: Wherefore hath Jahveh done thus unto this great city? <a href="/jeremiah/22-9.htm">Jeremiah 22:9</a>. And they will say: Because they have forsaken the covenant of Jahveh their God, and worshipped other gods and served them."<p>Go down into the house of the king. The prophet could go down only from the temple; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/36-12.htm">Jeremiah 36:12</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/26-10.htm">Jeremiah 26:10</a>. Not only the king is to hear the word of the Lord, but his servants too, and the people, who go in by these gates, the gates of the royal castle. The exhortation: to do right and justice, etc., is only an expansion of the brief counsel at <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-12.htm">Jeremiah 21:12</a>, and that brought home to the heart of the whole people in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-6.htm">Jeremiah 7:6</a>, cf. <a href="/ezekiel/22-6.htm">Ezekiel 22:6</a>.

On "kings riding," etc., cf. <a href="/jeremiah/17-25.htm">Jeremiah 17:25</a>. - With <a href="/jeremiah/22-5.htm">Jeremiah 22:5</a> cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-27.htm">Jeremiah 17:27</a>, where, however, the threatening is otherwise worded. &#1489;&#1468;&#1497; , cf. <a href="/genesis/22-16.htm">Genesis 22:16</a>. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; introduces the contents of the oath. "This house" is the royal palace. &#1500;&#1495;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492; as in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-34.htm">Jeremiah 7:34</a>, cf. <a href="/jeremiah/27-17.htm">Jeremiah 27:17</a>. The threatening is illustrated in <a href="/jeremiah/22-6.htm">Jeremiah 22:6</a> by further description of the destruction of the palace. The royal castle is addressed, and, in respect of its lofty situation and magnificence, is called a Gilead and a head of Lebanon. It lay on the north-eastern eminence of Mount Zion (see on <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/7-12.htm">1 Kings 7:12</a>, note 1), and contained the so-called forest-house of Lebanon (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/7-2.htm">1 Kings 7:2-5</a>) and various other buildings built of cedar, or, at least, faced with cedar planks (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-14.htm">Jeremiah 22:14</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/22-23.htm">Jeremiah 22:23</a>); so that the entire building might be compared to a forest of cedars on the summit of Lebanon. In the comparison to Gilead, Gilead can hardly be adduced in respect of its great fertility as a pasturing land (<a href="/numbers/32-1.htm">Numbers 32:1</a>; <a href="/micah/7-14.htm">Micah 7:14</a>), but in virtue of the thickly wooded covering of the hill-country of Gilead on both sides of the Jabbok. This is still in great measure clothed with oak thickets and, according to Buckingham, the most beautiful forest tracts that can be imagined; cf. C. v. Raumer, Pal. S. 82.<p>(Note: In 1834 Eli Smith travelled through it, and thus writes: "Jebel 'Ajlun presents the most charming rural scenery that I have seen in Syria. A continued forest of noble trees, chiefly the evergreen oak, covers a large part of it, while the ground beneath is clothed with luxuriant grass and decked with a rich variety of wild flowers. As we went from el-Husn to 'Ajlun our path lay along the summit of the mountain; and we often overlooked a large part of Palestine on one side and the whole of Haurn." - Rob. Phys. Geog. p. 54.)<p>&#1488;&#1501; &#1500;&#1488; is a particle of asseveration. This glorious forest of cedar buildings is to become a &#1502;&#1491;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;, a treeless steppe, cities uninhabited. "Cities" refers to the thing compared, not to the emblem; and the plural, as being the form for indefinite generality, presents no difficulty. And the attachment thereto of a singular predicate has many analogies in its support, cf. Ew. 317, a. The Keri &#1504;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468; is an uncalled for emendation of the Chet. &#1504;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1492;, cf. <a href="/jeremiah/6-5.htm">Jeremiah 6:5</a>. - "I consecrate," in respect that the destroyers are warriors whom God sends as the executors of His will, see on <a href="/jeremiah/6-4.htm">Jeremiah 6:4</a>. With "a man and his weapons," cf. <a href="/ezekiel/9-2.htm">Ezekiel 9:2</a>. In keeping with the figure of a forest, the destruction is represented as the hewing down of the choicest cedars; cf. <a href="/isaiah/10-34.htm">Isaiah 10:34</a>. - Thus is to be accomplished in Jerusalem what Moses threatened, <a href="/deuteronomy/29-23.htm">Deuteronomy 29:23</a>; the destroyed city will become a monument of God's wrath against the transgressors of His covenant. <a href="/jeremiah/22-8.htm">Jeremiah 22:8</a> is modelled upon <a href="/deuteronomy/29-23.htm">Deuteronomy 29:23</a>., cf. <a href="/1_kings/9-8.htm">1 Kings 9:8</a>., and made to bear upon Jerusalem, since, along with the palace, the city too is destroyed by the enemy.<p>From <a href="/jeremiah/22-10.htm">Jeremiah 22:10</a> onwards the exhortation to the evil shepherds becomes a prophecy concerning the kings of that time, who by their godless courses hurried on the threatened destruction. The prophecy begins with King Jehoahaz, who, after a reign of three months, had bee discrowned by Pharaoh Necho and carried captive to Egypt; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/23-30.htm">2 Kings 23:30-35</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-1.htm">2 Chronicles 36:1-4</a>. </body></html>
