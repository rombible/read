The prophet speaks to the land of Judea, which he commands to write down the following prediction, that it might be remembered by them, and the truth of it be thereby made manifest. <span class="ital">Write ye this man childless </span>— Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">ערירי</span>, <span class="ital">solitary, deprived, destitute. </span>The LXX. render it <span class="greekheb">εκκηρυκτον αυθρωτον</span>, <span class="ital">an ejected, </span>or <span class="ital">expelled man; a man that shall not prosper in his days — </span>This latter clause seems explanatory of the former; and that again is further explained in the following: “For no man of his seed shall prosper, sitting upon the throne of David, and ruling any more in Judah.” That Jeconiah had children appears both from this verse and <a href="/jeremiah/22-28.htm" title="Is this man Coniah a despised broken idol? is he a vessel wherein is no pleasure? why are they cast out, he and his seed, and are cast into a land which they know not?">Jeremiah 22:28</a>; but according to this prophecy, no man of his seed sat upon the throne of David. This seems the true exposition of this passage, which has been considered as attended with considerable difficulty. “I cannot,” says Blaney, “agree with the generality of commentators, who suppose that God hereby declares it as a thing certain, and, as it were, orders it to be inserted among the public acts of his government, that Jeconiah should die absolutely childless. Other parts of Scripture positively assert him to have had children, <a href="/context/1_chronicles/3-17.htm" title="And the sons of Jeconiah; Assir, Salathiel his son,...">1 Chronicles 3:17-18</a>; <a href="/matthew/1-12.htm" title="And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel;">Matthew 1:12</a>. Both <a href="/jeremiah/22-28.htm" title="Is this man Coniah a despised broken idol? is he a vessel wherein is no pleasure? why are they cast out, he and his seed, and are cast into a land which they know not?">Jeremiah 22:28</a>, and the subsequent part of this verse, imply that he either had, or should have, seed. But the historians and chroniclers of the times are called upon, and directed to set him down childless; not as being literally so, but yet the same to all intents and purposes of public life, for he was to be the last of his race that should sit upon the throne of David; and his descendants were no more to figure as kings, but to be reduced to the rank and obscurity of private persons. And in this sense the prophecy was actually fulfilled, for, allowing Zerubbabel, who is called governor of Judah, (<a href="/haggai/1-1.htm" title="In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, in the first day of the month, came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, saying,">Haggai 1:1</a>,) to have been a lineal descendant of Jeconiah, yet he could not be said to sit upon the throne of David, and reign, or rule, in Judah, seeing he was but a provincial governor, a mere servant of the king of Persia, in whom the sovereignty resided; nor were any of those persons kings who afterward reigned in Judah, even of the family of David, until the time of Christ.” <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/22.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>22:20-30 The Jewish state is described under a threefold character. Very haughty in a day of peace and safety. Very fearful on alarm of trouble. Very much cast down under pressure of trouble. Many never are ashamed of their sins till brought by them to the last extremity. The king shall close his days in bondage. Those that think themselves as signets on God's right hand, must not be secure, but fear lest they should be plucked thence. The Jewish king and his family shall be carried to Babylon. We know where we were born, but where we shall die we know not; it is enough that our God knows. Let it be our care that we die in Christ, then it will be well with us wherever we die, thought it may be in a far country. The Jewish king shall be despised. Time was when he was delighted in; but all those in whom God has no pleasure, some time or other, will be so lowered, that men will have no pleasure in them. Whoever are childless, it is the Lord that writes them so; and those who take no care to do good in their days, cannot expect to prosper. How little is earthly grandeur to be depended upon, or flourishing families to be rejoiced in! But those who hear the voice of Christ, and follow him, have eternal life, and shall never perish, neither shall any enemy pluck them out of his almighty hands.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Earth - On the repetition compare <a href="/jeremiah/7-4.htm">Jeremiah 7:4</a> note. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>29, 30. O earth! earth! earth!&#8212;Jeconiah was not actually without offspring (compare Jer 22:28, "his seed"; 1Ch 3:17, 18; Mt 1:12), but he was to be "written childless," as a warning to posterity, that is, without a lineal heir to his throne. It is with a reference to the three kings, Shallum, Jehoiakim, and Jeconiah, that the earth is thrice invoked [Bengel]. Or, the triple invocation is to give intensity to the call for attention to the announcement of the end of the royal line, so far as Jehoiachin's seed is concerned. Though Messiah (Mt 1:1-17), the heir of David's throne, was lineally descended from Jeconiah, it was only through Joseph, who, though His legal, was not His real father. Matthew gives the legal pedigree through Solomon down to Joseph; Luke the real pedigree, from Mary, the real parent, through Nathan, brother of Solomon, upwards (Lu 3:31).<p>no man of his seed &#8230; upon the throne&#8212;This explains the sense in which "childless" is used. Though the succession to the throne failed in his line, still the promise to David (Ps 89:30-37) was revived in Zerubbabel and consummated in Christ.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/22.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> By <span class="bld">earth</span> he either means the land of Judah, to which he calls thrice, to signify the deafness of this people, and unwillingness to hear and believe what God spake by him; or else he calls to the whole earth, as he calls heaven and earth to witness, <span class="bld"><a href="/deuteronomy/30-19.htm" title="I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life, that both you and your seed may live:">Deu 30:19</a> 32:1 <a href="/isaiah/1-2.htm" title="Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth: for the LORD has spoken, I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me.">Isaiah 1:2</a> 34:1 <a href="/jeremiah/6-19.htm" title="Hear, O earth: behold, I will bring evil on this people, even the fruit of their thoughts, because they have not listened to my words, nor to my law, but rejected it.">Jeremiah 6:19</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/22.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>O earth, earth, earth,....

Some think reference is had to the land from which, and that to which, the Jews removed, and the land of Israel, through which they passed.

Thus Judah had behaved from youth up, i.e., from the time it had become the people of God and been led out of captivity; see <a href="/jeremiah/2-2.htm">Jeremiah 2:2</a>; <a href="/hosea/2-17.htm">Hosea 2:17</a>. - In <a href="/jeremiah/22-22.htm">Jeremiah 22:22</a> &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492; is chosen for the sake of the word-play with &#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1498;, and denotes to depasture, as in <a href="/jeremiah/2-16.htm">Jeremiah 2:16</a>. As the storm-wind, especially the parching east wind, depastures, so to speak, the grass of the field, so will the storm about to break on Judah sweep away the shepherds, carry them off; cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-24.htm">Jeremiah 13:24</a>, <a href="/isaiah/27-8.htm">Isaiah 27:8</a>; <a href="/job/27-21.htm">Job 27:21</a>. The shepherds of the people are not merely the kings, but all its leaders, the authorities generally, as in <a href="/jeremiah/10-21.htm">Jeremiah 10:21</a>; and "thy shepherds" is not equivalent to "thy lovers," but the thought is this: Neither its allies nor its leaders will be able to help; the storm of calamity will sweep away the former, the latter must go captive. So that there is no need to alter &#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1498; into &#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1498; (Hitz.). With the last clause cf. <a href="/jeremiah/2-36.htm">Jeremiah 2:36</a>. Then surely will the daughter of Zion, feeling secure in her cedar palaces, sigh bitterly. The inhabitants of Jerusalem are said to dwell in Lebanon and to have their nests in cedars in reference to the palaces of cedar belonging to the great and famous, who at the coming destruction will suffer most. As to the forms &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; and &#1502;&#1511;&#1504;&#1468;&#1504;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, see on <a href="/jeremiah/10-17.htm">Jeremiah 10:17</a>. The explanation of the form &#1504;&#1495;&#1504;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; is disputed. Ros., Ges., and others take it for the Niph. of &#1495;&#1504;&#1503;, with the force: to be compassionated, thus: who deserving of pity or compassion wilt thou be! But this rendering does not give a very apt sense, even if it were not the case that the sig. to be worthy of pity is not approved by usage, and that it is nowhere taken from the Niph. We therefore prefer the derivation of the word from &#1488;&#1504;&#1509;, Niph. &#1504;&#1488;&#1504;&#1495; .hpi, contr. &#1504;&#1504;&#1495;, a derivative founded on the lxx rendering: &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, and Vulg. quomodo congemuisti. The only question that then remains is, whether the form &#1504;&#1495;&#1504;&#1514;&#1468; has arisen by transposition from &#1504;&#1504;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;, so as to avoid the coming together of the same letter at the beginning (Ew., Hitz., Gr.); or whether, with Bttch. ausf. Gramm. 1124, B, it is to be held as a reading corrupted from &#1504;&#1504;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;.
