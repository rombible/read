An ass's burial shall his burial be, dragged and cast far away from the gates of Jerusalem."<p>The prediction as to Jehoiakim begins with a woe upon the unjust oppression of the people. The oppression consisted in his building a magnificent palace with the sweat and blood of his subjects, whom he compelled to do forced labour without giving the labourers wages. The people must have felt this burden all the more severely that Jehoiakim, to obtain the throne, had bound himself to pay to Pharaoh a large tribute, the gold and silver for which he raised from the population according to Pharaoh's own valuation, <a href="/2_kings/23-33.htm">2 Kings 23:33</a>. With "Woe to him that buildeth," etc., cf. <a href="/habakkuk/2-12.htm">Habakkuk 2:12</a>; <a href="/micah/3-10.htm">Micah 3:10</a>. "That maketh his fellow labour," lit., through his neighbour he works, i.e., he causes the work to be done by his neighbour (fellow-man) for nought, without giving him wages, forces him to unpaid statute-labour. &#1506;&#1489;&#1491; &#1489;&#1468; as in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/25-39.htm">Leviticus 25:39</a>, <a href="/leviticus/25-46.htm">Leviticus 25:46</a>. &#1508;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;, labour, work, gain, then wages, cf. <a href="/job/7-2.htm">Job 7:2</a>. Jehoiakim sought to increase the splendour of his kingship by palace-building. To this the speech points, put in his mouth at <a href="/jeremiah/22-14.htm">Jeremiah 22:14</a> : I will build me &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; &#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, a house of extensions, i.e., a palace in the grand style, with spacious halls, vast chambers. &#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; from &#1512;&#1493;&#1495;, to find vent, cheer up, <a href="/1_samuel/16-23.htm">1 Samuel 16:23</a>; not airy, but spacious, for quite a modest house might have airy chambers. &#1493;&#1511;&#1512;&#1506; is a continuation of the participle; literally: and he cuts himself out windows, makes huge openings in the walls for windows. This verb is used in <a href="/jeremiah/4-30.htm">Jeremiah 4:30</a> of opening up the eyes with paint. &#1495;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497; presents some difficulty, seeing that the suffix of the first person makes no sense. It has therefore been held to be a contracted plural form (Gesen. Lehrgeb. S. 523) or for a dual (Ew. 177, a), but without any proof of the existence of such formations, since &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489;&#1497;, <a href="/amos/7-1.htm">Amos 7:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/nahum/3-17.htm">Nahum 3:17</a>, is to be otherwise explained (see on <a href="/amos/7-1.htm">Amos 7:1</a>). Following on the back of J. D. Mich., Hitz., Graf, and Bttcher (ausf. Gramm. 414) propose to connect the &#1493; before &#1505;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503; with this word and to read &#1495;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493;: and tears open for himself his windows; in support of which it is alleged that one cod. so reads. But this one cod. can decide nothing, and the suffix his is superfluous, even unsuitable, seeing that there can be no thought of another person's building; whereas the copula cannot well be omitted before &#1505;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;. For the rule adduced for this, that the manner of the principal action is frequently explained by appending infinitives absoll. (Ew. 280, a), does not meet the present case; the covering with cedar, etc., does not refer to the windows, and so cannot be an explanation of the cutting out for himself. We therefore hold, with Bttcher (Proben, S. 40), that &#1495;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497; is an adjective formation, with the force of: abundant in windows, since this formation is completely accredited by &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497; and &#1495;&#1512;&#1497; (cf. Ew. 164, c); and the objection alleged against this by Graf, that then no object is specified for "cutteth out," is not of much weight, it being easy to supply the object from the preceding "house:" and he cuts it out for himself abounding in windows. There needs be no change of &#1493;&#1505;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503; into &#1493;&#1505;&#1508;&#1493;&#1503;. For although the infin. absol. would be quite in place as continuation of the verb. fin. (cf. Ew. 351, c), yet it is not necessary. The word is attached in zeugma to &#1493;&#1511;&#1512;&#1506; or &#1495;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;: and he covers with cedar, to: faces or overlays, for this verb does not mean to plank or floor, for which &#1510;&#1508;&#1468;&#1492; is the usual word, but hide, cover, and is used <a href="/1_kings/6-9.htm">1 Kings 6:9</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/7-3.htm">1 Kings 7:3</a>, for roofing. The last statement is given in infin. absol.: &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1495; :.los, and besmears it, paints it (the building) with &#1513;&#1473;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, red ochre, a brilliant colour (lxx &#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, i.e., acc. to Kimchi, red lead; see Gesen. thess s.v.). </body></html>
