Gilead was the richest and most fertile part of the country.

But sin will be the ruin of the houses of princes, as well as of meaner men. And who can contend with destroyers of God's preparing?

Though thou art as beautiful as Gilead, and as majestic in Mine eyes (before Me) as the summit of Lebanon, yet surely (the Hebrew is a formula of swearing to express certainly: "If I do not make thee &#8230; believe Me not ever hereafter": so "as truly as I live," Nu 14:28; "surely," Nu 14:35). The mention of Gilead may allude not only to its past beauty, but covertly also to its desolation by the judgment on Israel; a warning now to Judah and the house of David. "Lebanon" is appropriately mentioned, as the king's house was built of its noble cedars.<p>cities&#8212;not other cities, but the different parts of the city of Jerusalem (2Sa 12:27; 2Ki 10:25) [Maurer].<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/22.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Interpreters are not agreed in what sense God saith that <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">the king’s house of Judah</span> was unto him as <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Gilead, </span> or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">the head of Lebanon.</span> Gilead was a country fertile for pastures; upon which account the Reubenites and Gadites, being men whose estates lay in cattle, begged it of Moses for their portion, <span class="bld"><a href="/numbers/32-2.htm" title="The children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spoke to Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and to the princes of the congregation, saying,">Numbers 32:2</a></span>, and Moses gave it to the sons of Manasseh, <span class="bld"><a href="/numbers/32-40.htm" title="And Moses gave Gilead to Machir the son of Manasseh; and he dwelled therein.">Numbers 32:40</a></span>.

It had in it a famous mountain. Lebanon also was a very pleasant place, famous for cedars, and indeed whatsoever could gratify, the senses; they both were in the lot of Gad and Manasseh. Some think God compareth the king of Judah’s house to these places, in regard of the height and nobleness of the structure; others, for the pleasantness and delightfulness of it. Others consider Gilead as the principal part of the inheritance of the ten tribes, wasted by Tiglath-pileser, <span class="bld"><a href="/2_kings/15-29.htm" title="In the days of Pekah king of Israel came Tiglathpileser king of Assyria, and took Ijon, and Abelbethmaachah, and Janoah, and Kedesh, and Hazor, and Gilead, and Galilee, all the land of Naphtali, and carried them captive to Assyria.">2 Kings 15:29</a></span>; and that God telleth them, by this comparison, that he would certainly destroy them, and make them as Gilead, which was the <span class="ital">head of Lebanon</span>. Though Jerusalem were a noble and pleasant place, yet they might remember so was Gilead, which yet for their sins was wasted and brought to ruin.

Of Gilead in general, Canon Tristram writes, "No one can fairly judge of Israel's heritage who has not seen the luxuriant exuberance of Gilead, as well as the bard rocks of Judaea." And again, "Lovely knolls and dells open out at every turn, gently rising to the wooded plateau above. Then we rise to higher ground and ride through noble forests of oak. Then for a mile or two through luxuriant green corn, or perhaps through a rich forest of scattered olive trees, left untended and uncared for, with perhaps patches of corn in the open glades" ('Bible Places,' p. 322). The cedars of Lebanon, however diminished, still bear witness to the ancient fame of this splendid mountain district. <span class="cmt_word">A wilderness, and cities which are not inhabited</span>. The comparison has a terrible significance when read in the light of De Vogue's and Freshfield's discoveries. For Gilead itself is full of ruined cities of massive stone architecture. "It is no uncommon thing," says Mr. F.A. Eaton, "to see these houses in a complete state of preservation, built of huge blocks of black basalt, with slabs of the same for the roof, twelve feet long, a foot and a half wide, and half a foot thick, and entrance doors also of basalt... great solid stones of the same material being used as lintels at the top and bottom" (Speech at the meeting for setting on foot the survey of Eastern Palestine, November 30, 1880: <span class="accented">Statement of Palestine Exploration Fund</span>, January, 1880, p. 11). <span class="accented">Cities which are not inhabited</span>; not, indeed, the cities of Gilead of the time of Jeremiah, but constructed of materials which may reasonably be presumed to have been chiseled in a far more remote antiquity. (The date of the cities in their present state is subsequent to the Christian era.) <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/21.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The chastisement of Jerusalem. - <a href="/jeremiah/21-13.htm">Jeremiah 21:13</a>. "Behold, I am against thee, inhabitress of the valley, of the rock of the plain, saith Jahveh, ye who say: Who shall come down against us, and who shall come into our dwellings? <a href="/jeremiah/21-14.htm">Jeremiah 21:14</a>. And will visit you according to the fruit of your doings, saith Jahveh, and kindle a fire in her forest, that it may devour all her surroundings." This threatening is levelled against the citizens of Jerusalem, who vaunted the impregnableness of their city. The inhabitress of the valley is the daughter of Zion, the population of Jerusalem personified. The situation of the city is spoken of as &#1506;&#1502;&#1511;, ravine between mountains, in respect that Jerusalem was encircled by mountains of greater height (<a href="/psalms/125-2.htm">Psalm 125:2</a>); and as rock of the plain, i.e., the region regarded as a level from which Mount Zion, the seat of the kingdom, rose, equivalent to rock of the field, <a href="/jeremiah/17-3.htm">Jeremiah 17:3</a>. In the "rock" we think specially of Mount Zion, and in the "valley" of the so-called lower city. The two designations are chosen to indicate the strong situation of Jerusalem. On this the inhabitants pride themselves, who say: Who shall come down against us? &#1497;&#1495;&#1514; for &#1497;&#1504;&#1495;&#1514;, from &#1504;&#1495;&#1514;; cf. Ew. 139, c.
