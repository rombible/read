But sin will be the ruin of the houses of princes, as well as of meaner men. And who can contend with destroyers of God's preparing?

The apostle saith that God, because he could swear by no greater, sware by himself. The end of an oath is, the confirmation of a thing where any doubt of the truth of it, or any have strife about it.

"Behold, I am against thee, inhabitress of the valley, of the rock of the plain, saith Jahveh, ye who say: Who shall come down against us, and who shall come into our dwellings? <a href="/jeremiah/21-14.htm">Jeremiah 21:14</a>. And will visit you according to the fruit of your doings, saith Jahveh, and kindle a fire in her forest, that it may devour all her surroundings." This threatening is levelled against the citizens of Jerusalem, who vaunted the impregnableness of their city. The inhabitress of the valley is the daughter of Zion, the population of Jerusalem personified. The situation of the city is spoken of as &#1506;&#1502;&#1511;, ravine between mountains, in respect that Jerusalem was encircled by mountains of greater height (<a href="/psalms/125-2.htm">Psalm 125:2</a>); and as rock of the plain, i.e., the region regarded as a level from which Mount Zion, the seat of the kingdom, rose, equivalent to rock of the field, <a href="/jeremiah/17-3.htm">Jeremiah 17:3</a>. In the "rock" we think specially of Mount Zion, and in the "valley" of the so-called lower city. The two designations are chosen to indicate the strong situation of Jerusalem. On this the inhabitants pride themselves, who say: Who shall come down against us? &#1497;&#1495;&#1514; for &#1497;&#1504;&#1495;&#1514;, from &#1504;&#1495;&#1514;; cf. Ew. 139, c. Dwellings, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-30.htm">Jeremiah 25:30</a>, not cities or refuge or coverts of wild animals; &#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1503; has not this force, but can at most acquire it from the context; see Del. on <a href="/psalms/26-8.htm">Psalm 26:8</a>. The strength of the city will not shield the inhabitants from the punishment with which God will visit them. "According to the fruit," etc., cf. <a href="/jeremiah/17-10.htm">Jeremiah 17:10</a>. I kindle fire in her forest. The city is a forest of houses, and the figure is to be explained by the simile in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-6.htm">Jeremiah 22:6</a>, but was not suggested by &#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1503;  equals  lustra ferarum (Hitz.). All her surroundings, how much more then the city itself! </body></html>
