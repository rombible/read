Very haughty in a day of peace and safety. Very fearful on alarm of trouble. Very much cast down under pressure of trouble. Many never are ashamed of their sins till brought by them to the last extremity. The king shall close his days in bondage. Those that think themselves as signets on God's right hand, must not be secure, but fear lest they should be plucked thence. The Jewish king and his family shall be carried to Babylon. We know where we were born, but where we shall die we know not; it is enough that our God knows. Let it be our care that we die in Christ, then it will be well with us wherever we die, thought it may be in a far country. The Jewish king shall be despised. Time was when he was delighted in; but all those in whom God has no pleasure, some time or other, will be so lowered, that men will have no pleasure in them. Whoever are childless, it is the Lord that writes them so; and those who take no care to do good in their days, cannot expect to prosper. How little is earthly grandeur to be depended upon, or flourishing families to be rejoiced in!

The prophet's human feelings are stirred; he cannot withhold his sympathy from the sad fate of his king. What! he exclaims; is it possible that this Coniah is treated as a piece of ill-wrought pottery ware (comp. <a href="/jeremiah/18-4.htm">Jeremiah 18:4</a>), and "hurled" into a strange land? <span class="cmt_word">He and his seed</span>. These words have caused some difficulty, owing to the youth, of Jehoiachin. According to <a href="/2_kings/24-8.htm">2 Kings 24:8</a> he was only eighteen when he was carried captive, while <a href="/2_chronicles/36-9.htm">2 Chronicles 36:9</a> makes him still younger, only eight (Josiah's age on his accession). Hitzig thinks the latter number is to be preferred; his chief reasons are the prominence given to the queen-mother, and the fact that the length of Jehoiachin's reign is given with more precise accuracy in 2 Chronicles than in 2 Kings. It is true that the king's wives are mentioned in <a href="/2_kings/24-15.htm">2 Kings 24:15</a>. But that he had wives may, according to Hitzig, have been inferred by the late compiler of Kings from the passage before us; or the "wives" may have been those of Jehoiachin's predecessor (comp. <a href="/2_samuel/16-21.htm">2 Samuel 16:21</a>). Graf's conjecture is, perhaps, the safest view of the case, whether we accept the number eighteen or the number eight; it is that the "seed" spoken of as born to Jehoiachin in his captivity, and is reckoned to him by anticipation. It should be mentioned, however, that the Septuagint omits "he and his seed" altogether. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/22.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The cause of this calamity: because Judah in its prosperity had not hearkened to the voice of its God. &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514;, from &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1492;, security, tranquillity, state of well-being free from anxiety; the plur. denotes the peaceful, secure relations. Thus Judah had behaved from youth up, i.e., from the time it had become the people of God and been led out of captivity; see <a href="/jeremiah/2-2.htm">Jeremiah 2:2</a>; <a href="/hosea/2-17.htm">Hosea 2:17</a>. - In <a href="/jeremiah/22-22.htm">Jeremiah 22:22</a> &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492; is chosen for the sake of the word-play with &#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1498;, and denotes to depasture, as in <a href="/jeremiah/2-16.htm">Jeremiah 2:16</a>. As the storm-wind, especially the parching east wind, depastures, so to speak, the grass of the field, so will the storm about to break on Judah sweep away the shepherds, carry them off; cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-24.htm">Jeremiah 13:24</a>, <a href="/isaiah/27-8.htm">Isaiah 27:8</a>; <a href="/job/27-21.htm">Job 27:21</a>. The shepherds of the people are not merely the kings, but all its leaders, the authorities generally, as in <a href="/jeremiah/10-21.htm">Jeremiah 10:21</a>; and "thy shepherds" is not equivalent to "thy lovers," but the thought is this: Neither its allies nor its leaders will be able to help; the storm of calamity will sweep away the former, the latter must go captive. So that there is no need to alter &#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1498; into &#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1498; (Hitz.). With the last clause cf. <a href="/jeremiah/2-36.htm">Jeremiah 2:36</a>. Then surely will the daughter of Zion, feeling secure in her cedar palaces, sigh bitterly. The inhabitants of Jerusalem are said to dwell in Lebanon and to have their nests in cedars in reference to the palaces of cedar belonging to the great and famous, who at the coming destruction will suffer most. As to the forms &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; and &#1502;&#1511;&#1504;&#1468;&#1504;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, see on <a href="/jeremiah/10-17.htm">Jeremiah 10:17</a>. The explanation of the form &#1504;&#1495;&#1504;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; is disputed. Ros., Ges., and others take it for the Niph. of &#1495;&#1504;&#1503;, with the force: to be compassionated, thus: who deserving of pity or compassion wilt thou be! But this rendering does not give a very apt sense, even if it were not the case that the sig. to be worthy of pity is not approved by usage, and that it is nowhere taken from the Niph. We therefore prefer the derivation of the word from &#1488;&#1504;&#1509;, Niph. &#1504;&#1488;&#1504;&#1495; .hpi, contr. &#1504;&#1504;&#1495;, a derivative founded on the lxx rendering: &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, and Vulg. quomodo congemuisti. The only question that then remains is, whether the form &#1504;&#1495;&#1504;&#1514;&#1468; has arisen by transposition from &#1504;&#1504;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;, so as to avoid the coming together of the same letter at the beginning (Ew., Hitz., Gr.); or whether, with Bttch. ausf. Gramm. 1124, B, it is to be held as a reading corrupted from &#1504;&#1504;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;. With "pangs," etc., cf. <a href="/jeremiah/13-21.htm">Jeremiah 13:21</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/6-24.htm">Jeremiah 6:24</a>. </body></html>
