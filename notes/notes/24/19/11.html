And as the bottle was broken, so shall Judah and Jerusalem be broken by the Chaldeans. No human hand can repair it; but if they return to the Lord he will heal. As they filled Tophet with the slain sacrificed to their idols, so will God fill the whole city with the slain that shall fall as sacrifices to his justice. Whatever men may think, God will appear as terrible against sin and sinners as the Scriptures state; nor shall the unbelief of men make his promise or his threatenings of no effect. The obstinacy of sinners in sinful ways, is their own fault; if they are deaf to the word of God, it is because they have stopped their ears. We have need to pray that God, by his grace, would deliver us from hardness of heart, and contempt of his word and commandments.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Made whole again - literally, "healed."

Jerom here again observes, that this is clearly spoken, not of the Babylonish, but of the Roman captivity; after the former the city was rebuilt, and the people returned to Judea, and restored to former plenty; but since the latter, under Vespasian, Titus, and Hadrian, the ruins of Jerusalem remain, and will till the conversion of the Jews: <p>and they shall bury them in Tophet, till there be no place to bury: where there should be such great numbers slain; or whither such multitudes of the slain should be brought out of the city to be buried there, that at length there would not be room enough to receive the dead into it; or, as the Syriac version renders it, "and in Tophet they shall bury, for want of a place to bury" in; in such a filthy, abominable, and accursed place shall their carcasses lie, where they were guilty of idolatry, and sacrificed their innocent babes, there being no other place to inter them in: an emblem this of their souls suffering in hell the vengeance of eternal fire. <p>(r) "sanari", Montanus; "curari", Pagninus, Junius &amp; Tremellius. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/19.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And shalt say to them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Even so will I break this people and this city, as <i>one</i> breaketh a <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> potter's vessel, that cannot be made whole again: and they shall bury <i>them</i> in Tophet, till <i>there be</i> no place to bury.</span><p>(e) This visible sign was to confirm them concerning the assurance of this plague, which the Lord threatened by his prophet.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/19.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">11</span>. <span class="ital">and they shall bury … to bury</span>] The absence of connexion shews this (not found in LXX) to be an insertion from <a href="/jeremiah/7-32.htm" title="Therefore, behold, the days come, said the LORD, that it shall no more be called Tophet, nor the valley of the son of Hinnom, but the valley of slaughter: for they shall bury in Tophet, till there be no place.">Jeremiah 7:32</a>.

Horrible evil will the Lord bring on this place, i.e., Jerusalem. The ears of every one that hears it will tingle, so utterly stunning will the news of it turn out to be; cf. <a href="/2_kings/21-12.htm">2 Kings 21:12</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-11.htm">1 Samuel 3:11</a>, where we find &#1514;&#1468;&#1510;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492;; cf. Ew. 197, a. This they have brought on themselves by their dreadful sins. They have forsaken Jahveh, disowned this place;  &#1504;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512; , prop. find strange, <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-27.htm">Deuteronomy 32:27</a>, then treat as strange, deny, <a href="/job/21-29.htm">Job 21:29</a>. In substance: they have not treated Jerusalem as the city of the sanctuary of their God, but, as it mentioned after, they have burnt incense in it to other (strange) gods. The words: they and their fathers, and the kings of Judah, are not the subject to "knew not," as is "they and their," etc., in <a href="/jeremiah/9-15.htm">Jeremiah 9:15</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-13.htm">Jeremiah 16:13</a>, but to the preceding verb of the principal clause. "And have filled the city with the blood of innocents." This Grot. and others understand by the blood of the children slain for Moloch; and for this, appeal is made to <a href="/psalms/106-37.htm">Psalm 106:37</a>., where the pouring out of innocent blood is explained to be that of sons and daughters offered to idols. But this passage cannot be the standard for the present one, neither can the statement that here we have to deal with idolatry alone. This latter is petitio principii. If shedding the blood of innocents had been said of offerings to Moloch, then <a href="/jeremiah/19-5.htm">Jeremiah 19:5</a> must be taken as epexegesis. But in opposition to this we have not only the parallelism of the clauses, but also and especially the circumstance, that not till <a href="/jeremiah/19-5.htm">Jeremiah 19:5</a> is mention made of altars on which to offer children of Moloch. We therefore understand the filling of Jerusalem with the blood of innocents, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-6.htm">Jeremiah 7:6</a>, cf. <a href="/jeremiah/2-34.htm">Jeremiah 2:34</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-3.htm">Jeremiah 22:3</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-17.htm">Jeremiah 22:17</a>, of judicial murder or of bloody persecution of the godly; and on two grounds: 1. because alongside of idolatry we always find mentioned as the chief sin the perversion of justice to the shedding of innocent blood (cf. the passages cited), so that this sin would not likely be omitted here, as one cause of the dreadful judgment about to pass on Jerusalem; 2. because our passage recalls the very wording of <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/21-16.htm">2 Kings 21:16</a>, where, after mentioning his idolatry, it is said of Manasseh: Also innocent blood hath he shed, until he made Jerusalem full (&#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1488;) to the brink.<p>The climax in the enumeration of sins in these verses is accordingly this: 1. The disowning of the holiness of Jerusalem as the abode of the Lord by the public practice of idolatry; 2. the shedding of innocent blood as extremity of injustice and godless judicial practices; 3. as worst of all abominations, the building of altars for burning their own children to Moloch. That the Moloch-sacrifices are mentioned last, as being worst of all, is shown by the three relative clauses: which I have not commanded, etc., which by an impassioned gradation of phrases mark God's abomination of these horrors. On this subject cf. <a href="/jeremiah/7-31.htm">Jeremiah 7:31</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/32-35.htm">Jeremiah 32:35</a>.</body></html>
