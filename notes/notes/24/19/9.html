For want of food; the famine should be so great and pressing. Jeremiah, that foretells this, was a witness of it, and has left it on record, <a href="/lamentations/4-10.htm">Lamentations 4:10</a>; <p>and they shall eat everyone the flesh of his friend. The Targum interprets it, the goods or substance of his neighbour; which is sometimes the sense of eating the flesh of another; but as it is to be taken in a literal sense, in the preceding clause, so in this: so it should be, <p>in the siege and straitness, wherewith their enemies, and they that seek their lives, shall straiten them; the siege of Jerusalem should be so close, that no provision could be got in to the relief of the inhabitants; which obliged them to take the shocking methods before mentioned. Jerom observes, that though this was fulfilled at the Babylonish captivity, yet more fully when Jerusalem was besieged by Vespasian and Titus, and in the times of Hadrian.

Horrible evil will the Lord bring on this place, i.e., Jerusalem. The ears of every one that hears it will tingle, so utterly stunning will the news of it turn out to be; cf. <a href="/2_kings/21-12.htm">2 Kings 21:12</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-11.htm">1 Samuel 3:11</a>, where we find &#1514;&#1468;&#1510;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492;; cf. Ew. 197, a. This they have brought on themselves by their dreadful sins. They have forsaken Jahveh, disowned this place;  &#1504;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512; , prop. find strange, <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-27.htm">Deuteronomy 32:27</a>, then treat as strange, deny, <a href="/job/21-29.htm">Job 21:29</a>. In substance: they have not treated Jerusalem as the city of the sanctuary of their God, but, as it mentioned after, they have burnt incense in it to other (strange) gods. The words: they and their fathers, and the kings of Judah, are not the subject to "knew not," as is "they and their," etc., in <a href="/jeremiah/9-15.htm">Jeremiah 9:15</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-13.htm">Jeremiah 16:13</a>, but to the preceding verb of the principal clause. "And have filled the city with the blood of innocents." This Grot. and others understand by the blood of the children slain for Moloch; and for this, appeal is made to <a href="/psalms/106-37.htm">Psalm 106:37</a>., where the pouring out of innocent blood is explained to be that of sons and daughters offered to idols. But this passage cannot be the standard for the present one, neither can the statement that here we have to deal with idolatry alone. This latter is petitio principii. If shedding the blood of innocents had been said of offerings to Moloch, then <a href="/jeremiah/19-5.htm">Jeremiah 19:5</a> must be taken as epexegesis. But in opposition to this we have not only the parallelism of the clauses, but also and especially the circumstance, that not till <a href="/jeremiah/19-5.htm">Jeremiah 19:5</a> is mention made of altars on which to offer children of Moloch. We therefore understand the filling of Jerusalem with the blood of innocents, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-6.htm">Jeremiah 7:6</a>, cf. <a href="/jeremiah/2-34.htm">Jeremiah 2:34</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-3.htm">Jeremiah 22:3</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-17.htm">Jeremiah 22:17</a>, of judicial murder or of bloody persecution of the godly; and on two grounds: 1. because alongside of idolatry we always find mentioned as the chief sin the perversion of justice to the shedding of innocent blood (cf. the passages cited), so that this sin would not likely be omitted here, as one cause of the dreadful judgment about to pass on Jerusalem; 2. because our passage recalls the very wording of <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/21-16.htm">2 Kings 21:16</a>, where, after mentioning his idolatry, it is said of Manasseh: Also innocent blood hath he shed, until he made Jerusalem full (&#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1488;) to the brink.<p>The climax in the enumeration of sins in these verses is accordingly this: 1. The disowning of the holiness of Jerusalem as the abode of the Lord by the public practice of idolatry; 2. the shedding of innocent blood as extremity of injustice and godless judicial practices; 3. as worst of all abominations, the building of altars for burning their own children to Moloch. That the Moloch-sacrifices are mentioned last, as being worst of all, is shown by the three relative clauses: which I have not commanded, etc., which by an impassioned gradation of phrases mark God's abomination of these horrors. On this subject cf. <a href="/jeremiah/7-31.htm">Jeremiah 7:31</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/32-35.htm">Jeremiah 32:35</a>.</body></html>
