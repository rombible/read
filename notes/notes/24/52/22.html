The word &#1492;&#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503;, instead of &#1492;&#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503; (Kings), seems to have originated simply through the exchange of &#1488; for &#1492;, and to mean, like the other, the multitude of people. Hitzig and Graf are of opinion that &#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503; here, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/8-30.htm">Proverbs 8:30</a>, means workmaster or artificer, and that &#1492;&#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503; denotes the same persons (collectively) who are designated &#1492;&#1495;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; &#1493;&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1505;&#1490;&#1468;&#1512; in <a href="/proverbs/24-1.htm">Proverbs 24:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/29-2.htm">Proverbs 29:2</a>, and <a href="/2_kings/24-14.htm">2 Kings 24:14</a>. But this view is opposed by the parallel passage, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-9.htm">Jeremiah 39:9</a>, where the whole of this verse occurs, and &#1497;&#1514;&#1512; &#1492;&#1506;&#1501; &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; stands instead of &#1497;&#1514;&#1512; &#1492;&#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503;. "The rest of the people of Jerusalem" are divided, by &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1493;&#1488;&#1514;, into those who went over to the Chaldeans, and the rest of the people who were taken prisoners by the Chaldeans at the capture of the city. The statement that both of these two classes of the population of Jerusalem were carried away to Babylon is so far limited by the further declaration, in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-16.htm">Jeremiah 52:16</a>, that Nebuzaradan did not carry away every one, without exception, but let a portion of the humbler inhabitants of the country, who had no property, remain in the land, as vinedressers and husbandmen, that they might till the land. Instead of &#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; there occurs in Kings &#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1514;, and in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-10.htm">Jeremiah 39:10</a>, more distinctly, &#1502;&#1503; &#1492;&#1506;&#1501; &#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, "some of the people, the humbler ones," who had no property of their own. &#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;, pl. &#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, is an abstract noun, "poverty;" the singular is used collectively, hence the plural is here used to supply the deficiency. For &#1497;&#1490;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501;, from &#1497;&#1490;&#1489;, to plough, there is found instead, in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/25-12.htm">2 Kings 25:12</a>, Kethib &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501;, from &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;, with the same meaning. </body></html>
