The provost-marshal, about a month after the taking of the city, returned with a part of the army, burned the temple, the great menâ€™s houses in the city, and many other houses, and carried away divers prisoners, but left some of the poorer sort of the people to dress the vineyards and till the grounds, which is a thing very usual with conquerors, for their own advantage, that their conquests may yield them some revenue. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/52.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left certain of the poor of the land,....

But this meaning of the words cannot be substantiated. &#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1492; means "oversight, mustering, or visitation (Heimsuchung), or vengeance," e.g., <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/10-3.htm">Isaiah 10:3</a>, but not punishment (Strafe), and the plural, "watches" (<a href="/ezekiel/9-1.htm">Ezekiel 9:1</a>) and "custody," <a href="/ezekiel/54-11.htm">Ezekiel 54:11</a>; hence the expression used here signifies "the house of custody," or "the house of the watches." The translation of the lxx can decide nothing against this, because their interpretation is based upon traditions which are themselves unfounded. Regarding this, Ewald well remarks (History of the People of Israel, iii. p. 748 of 2nd:ed.): "That Zedekiah must have laboured at the mill, as is mentioned in later chronicles (see Aug. Mai, Scriptorum veterum nova collectio, t. i. P. 2, p. 6; cf. Chr. Sam. Ch. xlv.), is probably a mere inference from <a href="/lamentations/5-13.htm">Lamentations 5:13</a>." </body></html>
