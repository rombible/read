For divide the two pillars into four quarters, according to the four winds; and let ninety-six pomegranates stand opposite to each of the four winds upon the two pillars; the whole number in front of the four winds, taken together, will be three hundred and eighty-four. But they were in four rows, two on each pillar, and in each row must have been four angular pomegranates, that could not be said to be opposite to any of the four winds, consequently, sixteen angular ones in the four rows; which sixteen being added to three hundred and eighty-four, make up the number of pomegranates in all four hundred; that is, a hundred in a row of wreathen work round about.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/52.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>52:12-23 The Chaldean army made woful havoc.

The discrepancy is thus removed. Each pillar was eighteen common cubits. The two together, deducting the base, were thirty-five, as stated in 2Ch 3:15 [Grotius].

The word &#1492;&#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503;, instead of &#1492;&#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503; (Kings), seems to have originated simply through the exchange of &#1488; for &#1492;, and to mean, like the other, the multitude of people. Hitzig and Graf are of opinion that &#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503; here, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/8-30.htm">Proverbs 8:30</a>, means workmaster or artificer, and that &#1492;&#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503; denotes the same persons (collectively) who are designated &#1492;&#1495;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; &#1493;&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1505;&#1490;&#1468;&#1512; in <a href="/proverbs/24-1.htm">Proverbs 24:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/29-2.htm">Proverbs 29:2</a>, and <a href="/2_kings/24-14.htm">2 Kings 24:14</a>. But this view is opposed by the parallel passage, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-9.htm">Jeremiah 39:9</a>, where the whole of this verse occurs, and &#1497;&#1514;&#1512; &#1492;&#1506;&#1501; &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; stands instead of &#1497;&#1514;&#1512; &#1492;&#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503;. "The rest of the people of Jerusalem" are divided, by &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1493;&#1488;&#1514;, into those who went over to the Chaldeans, and the rest of the people who were taken prisoners by the Chaldeans at the capture of the city. The statement that both of these two classes of the population of Jerusalem were carried away to Babylon is so far limited by the further declaration, in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-16.htm">Jeremiah 52:16</a>, that Nebuzaradan did not carry away every one, without exception, but let a portion of the humbler inhabitants of the country, who had no property, remain in the land, as vinedressers and husbandmen, that they might till the land. Instead of &#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; there occurs in Kings &#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1514;, and in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-10.htm">Jeremiah 39:10</a>, more distinctly, &#1502;&#1503; &#1492;&#1506;&#1501; &#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, "some of the people, the humbler ones," who had no property of their own. &#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;, pl. &#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, is an abstract noun, "poverty;" the singular is used collectively, hence the plural is here used to supply the deficiency. For &#1497;&#1490;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501;, from &#1497;&#1490;&#1489;, to plough, there is found instead, in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/25-12.htm">2 Kings 25:12</a>, Kethib &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501;, from &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;, with the same meaning. </body></html>
