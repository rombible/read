The word for “prison” is a peculiar one, and differs from that in <a href="/jeremiah/52-31.htm" title="And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the five and twentieth day of the month, that Evilmerodach king of Babylon in the first year of his reign lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah, and brought him forth out of prison.">Jeremiah 52:31</a>. Literally it means “house of visitation,” and this may imply either stricter custody, or more severe punishment in addition to imprisonment. The LXX. renders it by “house of the mill,” as though Zedekiah, after he had been blinded, had been made to do slave work like that of Samson. Possibly this was merely an inference from <a href="/lamentations/5-13.htm" title="They took the young men to grind, and the children fell under the wood.">Lamentations 5:13</a>. Such treatment of captive kings was, however, quite in keeping with the character of Assyrian and Chaldæan rulers. Thus Assur-bani-pal boasts that he placed a king of Arabia in chains, and bound him with the dogs, and caused him to be kept in one of the great gates of Nineveh (<span class= "ital">Records of the Past, </span>i. p. 93). So Darius, in the <span class= "ital">Behistun </span>inscription, boasts of having taken a rebel king of Sagartia, cut off his nose and ears, and kept him chained at his door (<span class= "ital">Records of the Past, </span>i. p. 119).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/52.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>52:1-11 This fruit of sin we should pray against above any thing; Cast me not away from thy presence, Ps 51:11.

The length of the siege of Jerusalem, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-4.htm">Jeremiah 52:4-7</a>, and the flight, capture, and condemnation of King Zedekiah and the princes of Judah, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-7.htm">Jeremiah 52:7-11</a>, not only agrees with <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/25-1.htm">2 Kings 25:1-7</a>, but also with <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-1.htm">Jeremiah 39:1-7</a>, where it is merely the forcible entrance into the city by the Chaldeans that receives special detail; see on <a href="/jeremiah/39-3.htm">Jeremiah 39:3</a>.

As to the account given of the flight, capture, and condemnation of the king, both <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/39.htm">Jeremiah 39</a> and 2 Kings mit the notices given in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-10.htm">Jeremiah 52:10</a>, "and also all the princes of Judah he caused to be slain (i.e., executed) at Riblah," and in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-11.htm">Jeremiah 52:11</a>, "and he put him in the prison-house till the day of his death." &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; has been rendered &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; &#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; by the lxx; on this fact Hitzig bases the opinion that the Hebrew words signify "the house of punishment," or "the house of correction," in which Zedekiah was obliged to turn the mill like other culprits, and as Samson was once obliged to do (<a href="/judges/16-21.htm">Judges 16:21</a>). But this meaning of the words cannot be substantiated. &#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1492; means "oversight, mustering, or visitation (Heimsuchung), or vengeance," e.g., <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/10-3.htm">Isaiah 10:3</a>, but not punishment (Strafe), and the plural, "watches" (<a href="/ezekiel/9-1.htm">Ezekiel 9:1</a>) and "custody," <a href="/ezekiel/54-11.htm">Ezekiel 54:11</a>; hence the expression used here signifies "the house of custody," or "the house of the watches." The translation of the lxx can decide nothing against this, because their interpretation is based upon traditions which are themselves unfounded. Regarding this, Ewald well remarks (History of the People of Israel, iii. p. 748 of 2nd:ed.): "That Zedekiah must have laboured at the mill, as is mentioned in later chronicles (see Aug. Mai, Scriptorum veterum nova collectio, t. i. P. 2, p. 6; cf. Chr. Sam. Ch. xlv.), is probably a mere inference from <a href="/lamentations/5-13.htm">Lamentations 5:13</a>." </body></html>
