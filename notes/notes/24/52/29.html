The calculation of Nebuchadnezzars reign is different from that used elsewhere, showing that the writer had access to a document not known to the compiler of the Book of Kings. In each date there is a difference of one year. The Septuagint omits <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-28.htm">Jeremiah 52:28-30</a>.<p>The number of the exiles carried away is small compared with the 42,360 men who returned <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/2-64.htm">Ezra 2:64-65</a>, leaving a large Jewish population behind at Babylon. But a continual drain of people from Judaea was going on, and the 10,000 carried away with Jehoiachin formed the nucleus and center, and gave tone to the whole (see <a href="/2_kings/24-14.htm">2 Kings 24:14</a>). When they began to thrive in Babylon, large numbers would emigrate there of their own accord.<p>A comparison of this chapter with the parallel portion of 2 Kings hows that though not free from clerical errors and mistakes of copyists the body of the text is remarkably sound. Many of the differences between the two texts are abbreviations made purposely by the compiler of the Book of Kings; others are the result of negligence; and upon the whole the text of the Book of Kings is inferior to that of the Appendix to the Book of Jeremiah. Bearing in mind, however, that possibly they are not two transcripts of the same text, but the result of an independent use by two different writers of the same original authority, their complete agreement, except in trivial matters and mistakes easy of correction, is a satisfactory proof of the general trust-worthiness of the Masoretic Text in all more important particulars.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/52.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>29. eighteenth year&#8212;when Jerusalem was taken.

The large brazen articles, the two pillars at the porch (cf. <a href="/1_kings/7-15.htm">1 Kings 7:15</a>.), the bases (<a href="/1_kings/7-27.htm">1 Kings 7:27</a>.), and the brazen sea (<a href="/1_kings/7-23.htm">1 Kings 7:23</a>.), which were too vast in their proportions to be easily carried away to Babylon, were broken to pieces by the Chaldeans, who carried off the brass of which they were made. &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; is more correct than &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;  (Kings), and "all their brass" is more precise than simply "their brass" (Kings). In the enumeration of the smaller brazen vessels used for the temple service, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-18.htm">Jeremiah 52:18</a>, there is omitted, in 2 Kings, &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1494;&#1512;&#1511;&#1493;&#1514;, "and the bowls" (used in sacrifice); this omission is perhaps due merely to an error in transcription. The enumeration of the gold and silver vessels in <a href="/jeremiah/52-19.htm">Jeremiah 52:19</a> has been much more abbreviated in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/25-15.htm">2 Kings 25:15</a>, where only "the fire-pans and the bowls" are mentioned, while in the text here, besides these there are named "the basons," then "the pots (Eng. vers. caldrons), and the candlesticks, and the pans (Eng. vers. spoons), and the cups." For particulars regarding these different vessels, see on <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/7-40.htm">1 Kings 7:40</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/7-45.htm">1 Kings 7:45</a>, <a href="/1_kings/7-50.htm">1 Kings 7:50</a>. In <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-20.htm">Jeremiah 52:20</a>, reference is made to the fact that the mass of metal in the vessels that were carried away was without weight. The same is stated in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/25-16.htm">2 Kings 25:16</a>, where, however, there is no mention of the twelve brazen bulls; while in the text of Jeremiah, &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514; &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1499;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; is faulty, and we must read instead, &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493; &#1493;&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1499;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;. The assertion of Graf, in his commentary on this verse, and of Thenius on <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/25-16.htm">2 Kings 25:16</a>, - that the notice regarding the twelve brazen bulls is incorrect, because these were then no longer in Jerusalem (27:19), but had previously been removed by Ahaz from under the brazen sea for Tiglath-pileser, - we have already, under <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/16-17.htm">2 Kings 16:17</a>, shown to be erroneous. The apposition of &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;  to &#1500;&#1504;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501; explains the reference of the suffix. In <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-21.htm">Jeremiah 52:21-23</a>, the narrator, in order to call attention to the amount of art exhibited on the vessels destroyed by the Chaldeans, gives a brief description of the brazen pillars with their capitals. This description is much shortened in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/25-17.htm">2 Kings 25:17</a>, and contains notices completing that which is given of these works of art in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/7.htm">1 Kings 7</a>.
