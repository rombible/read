The pomegranates here are ninety-six; but in 1Ki 7:20 they are two hundred on each chapiter, and four hundred on the two (2Ch 4:13). It seems there were two rows of them, one above the other, and in each row a hundred. They are here said to be ninety-six, but immediately following one hundred, and so in 1Ki 7:20. Four seem to have been unseen to one looking from one point; and the ninety-six are only those that could be seen [Vatablus]; or, the four omitted here are those separating the four sides, one pomegranate at each point of separation (or at the four corners) between the four sides [Grotius].<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/52.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> There are some differences as to the measure of these chapiters betwixt <span class="bld"><a href="/2_kings/25-17.htm" title="The height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, and the capital on it was brass: and the height of the capital three cubits; and the wreathen work, and pomegranates on the capital round about, all of brass: and like to these had the second pillar with wreathen work.">2 Kings 25:17</a></span> and this text; here the height of them is made to be five cubits, there it is said to be three cubits: that which is said to resolve this difficulty is, that there were three parts in the chapiter, the square, the belly, and the crown, and that this text gives an account of the whole; but that text, <span class="bld"><a href="/2_kings/25-17.htm" title="The height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, and the capital on it was brass: and the height of the capital three cubits; and the wreathen work, and pomegranates on the capital round about, all of brass: and like to these had the second pillar with wreathen work.">2 Kings 25:17</a></span>, gives an account only of the belly and the crown, which were no more than three cubits. The like difference there is betwixt this text and <span class="bld"><a href="/1_kings/7-20.htm" title="And the capitals on the two pillars had pomegranates also above, over against the belly which was by the network: and the pomegranates were two hundred in rows round about on the other capital.">1 Kings 7:20</a></span>, and <span class="bld"><a href="/2_chronicles/4-13.htm" title="And four hundred pomegranates on the two wreaths; two rows of pomegranates on each wreath, to cover the two pommels of the capitals which were on the pillars.">2 Chronicles 4:13</a></span>, about the number of the pomegranates.

The meaning is, there were a hundred in a row, in the two rows two hundred, in the four rows (two upon each pillar) four hundred. Some other difference also there is about the particular number of pomegranates on a side, which are here said to be but ninety-six, which make on the two sides but one hundred and ninety-two, on the four sides but three hundred and eighty-four, and comes up neither to the two hundred mentioned in the Book of Kings, nor to the number of four hundred mentioned in the Book of Chronicles. See the English Annotations, where the learned author hath observed that in the Hebrew, what we translate of a side, is word for word <span class="ital">windward</span>, that is, toward the four winds, so as the table was <span class="ital">square</span>, and there were twenty-four on each side, which made ninety-six in all, to which four being added. one at each corner, this made a hundred. But these are niceties, a satisfaction in which is of no great concernment to us, unless to satisfy such as would make use of these little things to question the authority of the Scriptures because of these seeming contradictions, of how little concernment soever they be as to our faith and holiness. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/52.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And there were ninety and six pomegranates on a side,....

The large brazen articles, the two pillars at the porch (cf. <a href="/1_kings/7-15.htm">1 Kings 7:15</a>.), the bases (<a href="/1_kings/7-27.htm">1 Kings 7:27</a>.), and the brazen sea (<a href="/1_kings/7-23.htm">1 Kings 7:23</a>.), which were too vast in their proportions to be easily carried away to Babylon, were broken to pieces by the Chaldeans, who carried off the brass of which they were made. &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; is more correct than &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;  (Kings), and "all their brass" is more precise than simply "their brass" (Kings). In the enumeration of the smaller brazen vessels used for the temple service, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-18.htm">Jeremiah 52:18</a>, there is omitted, in 2 Kings, &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1494;&#1512;&#1511;&#1493;&#1514;, "and the bowls" (used in sacrifice); this omission is perhaps due merely to an error in transcription. The enumeration of the gold and silver vessels in <a href="/jeremiah/52-19.htm">Jeremiah 52:19</a> has been much more abbreviated in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/25-15.htm">2 Kings 25:15</a>, where only "the fire-pans and the bowls" are mentioned, while in the text here, besides these there are named "the basons," then "the pots (Eng. vers. caldrons), and the candlesticks, and the pans (Eng. vers. spoons), and the cups." For particulars regarding these different vessels, see on <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/7-40.htm">1 Kings 7:40</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/7-45.htm">1 Kings 7:45</a>, <a href="/1_kings/7-50.htm">1 Kings 7:50</a>. In <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-20.htm">Jeremiah 52:20</a>, reference is made to the fact that the mass of metal in the vessels that were carried away was without weight. The same is stated in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/25-16.htm">2 Kings 25:16</a>, where, however, there is no mention of the twelve brazen bulls; while in the text of Jeremiah, &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514; &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1499;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; is faulty, and we must read instead, &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493; &#1493;&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1499;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;. The assertion of Graf, in his commentary on this verse, and of Thenius on <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/25-16.htm">2 Kings 25:16</a>, - that the notice regarding the twelve brazen bulls is incorrect, because these were then no longer in Jerusalem (27:19), but had previously been removed by Ahaz from under the brazen sea for Tiglath-pileser, - we have already, under <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/16-17.htm">2 Kings 16:17</a>, shown to be erroneous. The apposition of &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;  to &#1500;&#1504;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501; explains the reference of the suffix. In <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-21.htm">Jeremiah 52:21-23</a>, the narrator, in order to call attention to the amount of art exhibited on the vessels destroyed by the Chaldeans, gives a brief description of the brazen pillars with their capitals. This description is much shortened in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/25-17.htm">2 Kings 25:17</a>, and contains notices completing that which is given of these works of art in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/7.htm">1 Kings 7</a>.
