It presents some difficulties in detail. (1) The date given here, the “seventh year” of Nebuchadnezzar, does not agree with <a href="/2_kings/24-12.htm" title="And Jehoiachin the king of Judah went out to the king of Babylon, he, and his mother, and his servants, and his princes, and his officers: and the king of Babylon took him in the eighth year of his reign.">2Kings 24:12</a>, which gives the “eighth year” as the time of the first deportation after the defeat of Jehoiachin. (2) The number of the captives then carried into exile, given in <a href="/2_kings/24-14.htm" title="And he carried away all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and all the mighty men of valor, even ten thousand captives, and all the craftsmen and smiths: none remained, save the poorest sort of the people of the land.">2Kings 24:14</a> at 10,000, besides the craftsmen and the smiths, is given here as 3,023. The precision of the number seems to imply reference to a register or record of some kind, and so far bears <span class= "ital">primâ facie </span>evidence of accuracy. Probably the word “ten” has dropped out before “seven,” and we have here the record of a second deportation in the <span class= "ital">seventeenth </span>year of Nebuchadnezzar, while the siege of Jerusalem was going on, and made up in part of prisoners taken in skirmishes, and partly of the numerous Jews who “fell away to the Chaldæans” (<a href="/jeremiah/37-13.htm" title="And when he was in the gate of Benjamin, a captain of the ward was there, whose name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah; and he took Jeremiah the prophet, saying, You fall away to the Chaldeans.">Jeremiah 37:13</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/52.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/jeremiah/52-28.htm" title="This is the people whom Nebuchadrezzar carried away captive: in the seventh year three thousand Jews and three and twenty:...">Jeremiah 52:28-30</a></span>. <span class="ital">This is the people whom Nebuchadnezzar carried away captive </span>— “These verses are not inserted in 2 Kings 25. Nor are they to be found here, according to the Roman and Alexandrian editions of the LXX.; but in the Complutensian they are, and in two MSS. collated by Dr. Grabe; also in Theodotion’s version in the Hexapla. All the other ancient versions acknowledge them; and they are not omitted in any of the collated Hebrew MSS.; so that there is no doubt of their being genuine. But are we to conclude from them, that the whole number of the Jews, whom Nebuchadnezzar, in all his expeditions, carried into captivity, was no more than four thousand six hundred? This cannot be true, for he carried away more than twice that number at one time; which is expressly said to have been in the eighth year of his reign, <a href="/context/2_kings/24-12.htm" title="And Jehoiachin the king of Judah went out to the king of Babylon, he, and his mother, and his servants, and his princes, and his officers: and the king of Babylon took him in the eighth year of his reign....">2 Kings 24:12-16</a>. Before that time he had carried off a number of captives from Jerusalem in the first year of his reign, among whom were Daniel and his companions, <a href="/context/daniel/1-3.htm" title="And the king spoke to Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring certain of the children of Israel, and of the king's seed, and of the princes;...">Daniel 1:3-6</a>. And of these Berosus, the Chaldean historian, speaks, as cited by Josephus, <span class="ital">Ant., </span>lib. 10. cap. 11. These are confessedly not taken notice of here. And as the taking and burning of Jerusalem are in this very chapter said to have been in the fourth and fifth months of the 19th year of Nebuchadnezzar, those who were carried into captivity, at the date of those events, cannot possibly be the same with those that are said to be carried away either in the 18th or 23d year of that prince. Nor indeed is it credible, that the number carried away at the time the city was taken, and the whole country reduced, could be so few as eight hundred and thirty-two. Here then we have three deportations, and those the most considerable ones, in the 1st, the 8th, and 19th years of Nebuchadnezzar, sufficiently distinguished from those in his 7th, 18th, and 23d years. So that it seems most reasonable to conclude, with Archbishop Usher, that by the latter three the historian meant to point out deportations of a lesser kind, not elsewhere noticed in direct terms in Scripture.” — Blaney.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/52.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>52:24-30 The leaders of the Jews caused them to err; but now they are, in particular, made monuments of Divine justice.

The calculation of Nebuchadnezzars reign is different from that used elsewhere, showing that the writer had access to a document not known to the compiler of the Book of Kings. In each date there is a difference of one year.

But a continual drain of people from Judaea was going on, and the 10,000 carried away with Jehoiachin formed the nucleus and center, and gave tone to the whole (see <a href="/2_kings/24-14.htm">2 Kings 24:14</a>). When they began to thrive in Babylon, large numbers would emigrate there of their own accord.<p>A comparison of this chapter with the parallel portion of 2 Kings hows that though not free from clerical errors and mistakes of copyists the body of the text is remarkably sound. Many of the differences between the two texts are abbreviations made purposely by the compiler of the Book of Kings; others are the result of negligence; and upon the whole the text of the Book of Kings is inferior to that of the Appendix to the Book of Jeremiah. Bearing in mind, however, that possibly they are not two transcripts of the same text, but the result of an independent use by two different writers of the same original authority, their complete agreement, except in trivial matters and mistakes easy of correction, is a satisfactory proof of the general trust-worthiness of the Masoretic Text in all more important particulars.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/52.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>28. seventh year&#8212;in 2Ki 24:12, 14, 16, it is said "the eighth year" of Nebuchadnezzar. No doubt it was in part about the end of the seventh year, in part about the beginning of the eighth. Also in 2Ki 24:1-20, ten thousand (Jer 52:14), and seven thousand men of might, and a thousand craftsmen (Jer 52:16), are said to have been carried away, But here three thousand twenty-three. Probably the latter three thousand twenty-three were of the tribe of Judah, the remaining seven thousand out of the ten thousand were of the other tribes, out of which many Israelites still had been left in the land. The thousand "craftsmen" were exclusive of the ten thousand, as appears, by comparing 2Ki 24:14 with Jer 52:16. Probably the three thousand twenty-three of Judah were first removed in the end of "the seventh year"; the seven thousand and a thousand craftsmen in the "eighth year."

On the small number of Jews deported Ewald remarks, "Nothing so clearly shows the extent to which the best men from the upper classes had been already despatched by the Chaldeans across the Euphrates, as the fact that in all the years of the second, and, if it be insisted on, of the third revolt, put together, they found only 4600 men more whom they thought worth the trouble of transporting" ('History of Israel,' 4:265). As to the third deportation, see on Jeremiah 41:1. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/52.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The carrying away of the vessels of the temple is more fully stated than in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/25-13.htm">2 Kings 25:13-17</a>. The large brazen articles, the two pillars at the porch (cf. <a href="/1_kings/7-15.htm">1 Kings 7:15</a>.), the bases (<a href="/1_kings/7-27.htm">1 Kings 7:27</a>.), and the brazen sea (<a href="/1_kings/7-23.htm">1 Kings 7:23</a>.), which were too vast in their proportions to be easily carried away to Babylon, were broken to pieces by the Chaldeans, who carried off the brass of which they were made. &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; is more correct than &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;  (Kings), and "all their brass" is more precise than simply "their brass" (Kings). In the enumeration of the smaller brazen vessels used for the temple service, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-18.htm">Jeremiah 52:18</a>, there is omitted, in 2 Kings, &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1494;&#1512;&#1511;&#1493;&#1514;, "and the bowls" (used in sacrifice); this omission is perhaps due merely to an error in transcription. The enumeration of the gold and silver vessels in <a href="/jeremiah/52-19.htm">Jeremiah 52:19</a> has been much more abbreviated in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/25-15.htm">2 Kings 25:15</a>, where only "the fire-pans and the bowls" are mentioned, while in the text here, besides these there are named "the basons," then "the pots (Eng. vers. caldrons), and the candlesticks, and the pans (Eng. vers. spoons), and the cups." For particulars regarding these different vessels, see on <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/7-40.htm">1 Kings 7:40</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/7-45.htm">1 Kings 7:45</a>, <a href="/1_kings/7-50.htm">1 Kings 7:50</a>. In <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-20.htm">Jeremiah 52:20</a>, reference is made to the fact that the mass of metal in the vessels that were carried away was without weight. The same is stated in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/25-16.htm">2 Kings 25:16</a>, where, however, there is no mention of the twelve brazen bulls; while in the text of Jeremiah, &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514; &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1499;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; is faulty, and we must read instead, &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493; &#1493;&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1499;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;. The assertion of Graf, in his commentary on this verse, and of Thenius on <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/25-16.htm">2 Kings 25:16</a>, - that the notice regarding the twelve brazen bulls is incorrect, because these were then no longer in Jerusalem (27:19), but had previously been removed by Ahaz from under the brazen sea for Tiglath-pileser, - we have already, under <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/16-17.htm">2 Kings 16:17</a>, shown to be erroneous. The apposition of &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;  to &#1500;&#1504;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501; explains the reference of the suffix. In <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-21.htm">Jeremiah 52:21-23</a>, the narrator, in order to call attention to the amount of art exhibited on the vessels destroyed by the Chaldeans, gives a brief description of the brazen pillars with their capitals. This description is much shortened in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/25-17.htm">2 Kings 25:17</a>, and contains notices completing that which is given of these works of art in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/7.htm">1 Kings 7</a>.
