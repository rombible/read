Jeremiah was seized as a deserter, and committed to prison. But it is no new thing for the best friends of the church to be belied, as in the interests of her worst enemies. When thus falsely accused, we may deny the charge, and commit our cause to Him who judges righteously. Jeremiah obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful, and would not, to obtain mercy of man, be unfaithful to God or to his prince; he tells the king the whole truth. When Jeremiah delivered God's message, he spake with boldness; but when he made his own request, he spake submissively. A lion in God's cause must be a lamb in his own. And God gave Jeremiah favour in the eyes of the king. The Lord God can make even the cells of a prison become pastures to his people, and will raise up friends to provide for them, so that in the days of famine they shall be satisfied.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/37.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Dungeon - literally, house of a cistern or pit, and evidently underground.

The prophet naturally shrank from death, which makes his spiritual firmness the more remarkable; he was ready to die rather than swerve from his duty [Calvin].<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/37.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Though Jeremiah had dealt very faithfully with the king and princes, and they had dealt very hardly and cruelly with him, casting him for no just cause into a nasty prison, and Jeremiah knew well enough that Zedekiah was very soon to be disarmed of his power; yet (to learn us our duty) he speaks with all due respect and reverence to his sovereign, though a very bad man, and one who had dealt very ill with him. This petition of Jeremiah speaks the prison he was in was in a very inconvenient place, where he was in danger of his life. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/37.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Therefore hear now, one pray thee, O my lord the king,.... When the prophet spoke in the name of the Lord, and the words of the Lord, it was with great boldness and majesty; but when he spoke for himself, and on his own behalf, it was with great submission, as it became a subject to his king; and whom he owns as his sovereign lord, though a wicked prince, and whose destruction he knew was at hand: <p>let my supplication be accepted before thee; or, "fall before thee": see <a href="/jeremiah/36-7.htm">Jeremiah 36:7</a>; which was as follows: <p>that thou cause me not to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe; but that he might be discharged from his confinement; or however be removed into another prison, not so uncomfortable and disagreeable as this man's house or prison was; and which perhaps was still the worse through his cruel and ill natured carriage to him; and which all together endangered his life: wherefore he adds, <p>lest I die there; for though he had continued there many days, yet the place was so exceedingly noisome, that he thought he could not long continue there, was he remanded back to it. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/37.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Therefore hear now, I pray thee, O my lord the king: let my supplication, I pray thee, be accepted before thee; that thou cause me not to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/37.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">20</span>. <span class="ital">be accepted</span>] lit. <span class="ital">fall</span>.

From <a href="/jeremiah/37-16.htm">Jeremiah 37:16</a> we perceive that they were subterranean prisons and vaults into which the prisoners were thrust; and from v. 28 and <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-26.htm">Jeremiah 38:26</a>, it is clear that Jeremiah was in a confinement much more severe and dangerous to his life. There he sat many days, i.e., a pretty long time. </body></html>
