Josephus (a) says there was a battle fought between the Egyptians and Chaldeans, in which the latter were conquerors, and put the former to flight, and drove them out of all Syria. Jarchi relates a fable, how that the Egyptian army came by ships, and that at sea they saw strange appearances, upon which they said one to another, what means this? they replied, these are our fathers, whom the fathers of those we are going to help drowned in the sea; and immediately returned to their own land. <p>(a) Anitqu. l. 10. c. 7. sect. 3.<a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/37.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Thus shall ye say to the king of Judah, that sent you unto me to enquire of me; Behold, Pharaoh's army, which is come forth to help you, shall return to Egypt into their own land.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/37.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The account of what befell Jeremiah and what he did during the last siege of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans, until the taking of the city, is introduced, <a href="/jeremiah/37-1.htm">Jeremiah 37:1</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-2.htm">Jeremiah 37:2</a>, with the general remark that Zedekiah - whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had made king in the land of Judah in place of Coniah (on which name see on <a href="/jeremiah/22-24.htm">Jeremiah 22:24</a>) - when he became king, did not listen to the words of the Lord through Jeremiah, neither himself, nor his servants (officers), nor the people of the land (the population of Judah). Then follows, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-3.htm">Jeremiah 37:3-10</a>, a declaration of the prophet regarding the issue of the siege, which he sent to the king by the messengers who were to beseech him for his intercession with the Lord. <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-3.htm">Jeremiah 37:3-5</a>. The occasion of this declaration was the following: Zedekiah sent to Jeremiah two of his chief officers, Jehucal the son of Shelemiah (see on <a href="/jeremiah/38-1.htm">Jeremiah 38:1</a>), and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah, the priest (see <a href="/jeremiah/21-1.htm">Jeremiah 21:1</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/29-25.htm">Jeremiah 29:25</a>), with this charge: "Pray now for us to Jahveh our God." This message was sent to Jeremiah while he still went in and out among the people, and had not yet been put in prison (&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1488;, <a href="/jeremiah/37-4.htm">Jeremiah 37:4</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-31.htm">Jeremiah 52:31</a>, an unusual form for &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;, <a href="/jeremiah/37-15.htm">Jeremiah 37:15</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-18.htm">Jeremiah 37:18</a>, for which the Qeri would have us in both instances read &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;); the army of Pharaoh (Hophra, <a href="/jeremiah/44-30.htm">Jeremiah 44:30</a>), too, had marched out of Egypt to oppose the Chaldeans; and the latter, when they heard the report of them (&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1501;, the news of their approach), had withdrawn from Jerusalem (&#1506;&#1500;&#1492; &#1502;&#1506;&#1500;, see on <a href="/jeremiah/21-2.htm">Jeremiah 21:2</a>), viz., in order to repulse the Egyptians. Both of these circumstances are mentioned for the purpose of giving a clear view of the state of things: (a) Jeremiah's freedom to go in and out, not to prepare us for his imprisonment afterwards, but to explain the reason why the king sent two chief officers of the realm to him, whereas, after his imprisonment, he caused him to be brought (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/37-17.htm">Jeremiah 37:17</a> with <a href="/jeremiah/38-14.htm">Jeremiah 38:14</a>); and (b) the approach of the Egyptians joined with the raising of the siege, because this event seemed to afford some hope that the city would be saved. - This occurrence, consequently, falls within a later period than that mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-1.htm">Jeremiah 21:1-14</a>. </body></html>
