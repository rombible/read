And it is common for those to desire to be prayed for, who will not be advised; yet sinners are often hardened by a pause in judgments. But if God help us not, no creature can.

The king, his courtiers and subjects the royal family, nobility, and common people; they were all degenerate and corrupt. Jarchi observes, that Jehoiakim was wicked, and his people righteous; and that Zedekiah was righteous, and his people wicked but he seems to found his character on that single action of taking Jeremiah out of prison; whereas, according to this account, king and people were all wicked: for neither one or other <p>did hearken unto the words of the Lord, which he spake by Jeremiah the prophet; neither those which were spoken in the former nor in the latter part of his reign, concerning the destruction of the city by the Chaldeans. This short count is given to show how just it was to give up such a prince and people to ruin. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/37.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the land, did hearken unto the words of the LORD, which he spake by the prophet Jeremiah.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/36.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Not content with destroying the book, Jehoiakim also wished to get Baruch and Jeremiah out of the way; for he ordered the king's son Jerahmel and two other men to go for Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet; "but the Lord hid them," i.e., graciously kept them out of the sight of the spies. &#1489;&#1468;&#1503;&#1470;&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1498; is not the son of Jehoiakim, - if so, we would find simply &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;; but a royal prince is meant, cf. <a href="/jeremiah/38-6.htm">Jeremiah 38:6</a>; <a href="/1_kings/22-26.htm">1 Kings 22:26</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/11-1.htm">2 Kings 11:1-2</a>; <a href="/zephaniah/1-8.htm">Zephaniah 1:8</a>. </body></html>
