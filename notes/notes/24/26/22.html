Hezekiah who protected Micah, prospered. Did Jehoiakim, who slew Urijah, prosper? The examples of bad men, and the bad consequences of their sins, should deter from what is evil. Urijah was faithful in delivering his message, but faulty in leaving his work. And the Lord was pleased to permit him to lose his life, while Jeremiah was protected in danger. Those are safest who most simply trust in the Lord, whatever their outward circumstances may be; and that He has all men's hearts in his hands, encourages us to trust him in the way of duty.

With these last words they appeal to the people standing round who had heard the prophecy, for the princes had not reached the temple till after Jeremiah had been apprehended. <a href="/jeremiah/26-12.htm">Jeremiah 26:12</a>. To this Jeremiah answered in his own defence before the princes and all the people: "Jahveh hath sent me to prophesy against (&#1488;&#1500; for &#1506;&#1500;) this house and against this city all the words which ye have heard. <a href="/jeremiah/26-13.htm">Jeremiah 26:13</a>.

But I, behold, I am in your hand; do with me as seemeth to you good and right. <a href="/jeremiah/26-15.htm">Jeremiah 26:15</a>. Only ye must know, that if ye put me to death, ye bring innocent blood upon you, and upon this city, and upon her inhabitants; for of a truth Jahveh hath sent me to you to speak in your ears all these words." - As to "make your ways good," cf. <a href="/jeremiah/7-3.htm">Jeremiah 7:3</a>. This defence made an impression on the princes and on all the people. From the intimation that by reform it was possible to avert the threatened calamity, and from the appeal to the fact that in truth Jahveh had sent him and commanded him so to speak, they see that he is a true prophet, whose violent death would bring blood-guiltiness upon the city and its inhabitants. They therefore declare to the accusers, <a href="/jeremiah/26-16.htm">Jeremiah 26:16</a> : "This man is not worthy of death, for in the name of Jahveh our God hath he spoken unto us."</body></html>
