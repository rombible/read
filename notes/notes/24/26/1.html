It will be noted that there is no mention of the Chaldaeans, and that Jehoiakim is on friendly terms with Egypt (<a href="/jeremiah/26-22.htm" title="And Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt, namely, Elnathan the son of Achbor, and certain men with him into Egypt.">Jeremiah 26:22</a>). This points to the very earliest period of his reign. The chapter that follows, though referred to the same period in the present Hebrew text, really belongs to the reign of Zedekiah. (See Note on <a href="/jeremiah/27-1.htm" title="In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah came this word to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,">Jeremiah 27:1</a>.) The common element that led the compiler of the book to bring the narratives together is the conflict of Jeremiah with the false prophets.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/26.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/jeremiah/26-1.htm" title="In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah came this word from the LORD, saying,">Jeremiah 26:1</a></span>. <span class="ital">In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim, </span>&c. — The preceding chapter is dated in the fourth year of the reign of Jehoiakim, but ascribed, with probability, to the early part of that year. This chapter is dated in the beginning of the same reign. Hence it has been concluded, that this must have preceded the former in order of time. “But the conclusion,” says Blaney, “will not hold, if we consider that, (<a href="/jeremiah/28-1.htm" title="And it came to pass the same year, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year, and in the fifth month, that Hananiah the son of Azur the prophet, which was of Gibeon, spoke to me in the house of the LORD, in the presence of the priests and of all the people, saying,">Jeremiah 28:1</a>,) the <span class="ital">beginning </span>of Zedekiah’s reign is expressly declared to mean the fourth year and the fifth month of it.

So that the prophecy of this chapter, and the facts and events connected with it, were before the prophecy of the preceding chapter, though here related; that being in the fourth year, this in the beginning of Jehoiakim's reign. Josiah was lately dead; Jehoahaz his son reigned but three months, and then was deposed by Pharaohnecho king of Egypt; and this Jehoiakim, another son of Josiah, who before was called Eliakim, was set on the throne; and quickly after his coming to it <p>came this word from the Lord, saying; as follows, to the prophet.
