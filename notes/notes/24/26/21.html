Hezekiah who protected Micah, prospered. Did Jehoiakim, who slew Urijah, prosper? The examples of bad men, and the bad consequences of their sins, should deter from what is evil. Urijah was faithful in delivering his message, but faulty in leaving his work. And the Lord was pleased to permit him to lose his life, while Jeremiah was protected in danger. Those are safest who most simply trust in the Lord, whatever their outward circumstances may be; and that He has all men's hearts in his hands, encourages us to trust him in the way of duty. He will honour and recompense those who show kindness to such as are persecuted for his sake.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>His mighty men - The commanders of his army; the princes are the civil officers. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/26.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20. As the flight and capture of Urijah must have occupied some time, "the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim" (Jer 26:1) must not mean the very beginning, but the second or third year of his eleven years' reign.<p>And &#8230; also&#8212;perhaps connected with Jer 26:24, as the comment of the writer, not the continuation of the speech of the elders: "And although also a man that prophesied &#8230; Urijah &#8230; (proving how great was the danger in which Jeremiah stood, and how wonderful the providence of God in preserving him), nevertheless the hand of Ahikam," &c. [Glassius]. The context, however, implies rather that the words are the continuation of the previous speech of the elders. They adduce another instance besides that of Micah, though of a different kind, namely, that of Urijah: he suffered for his prophecies, but they imply, though they do not venture to express it, that thereby sin has been added to sin, and that it has done no good to Jehoiakim, for that the notorious condition of the state at this time shows that a heavier vengeance is impending if they persevere in such acts of violence [Calvin].<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/26.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> When Jehoiakim, our present king, and all his great men, heard of it, (probably by the information of others,) they judged it a capital crime, and used means to apprehend him, in order to the putting him to death, upon which the prophet being advertised of it, and fearing the issue, fled into Egypt. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/26.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And when Jehoiakim the king, with all his mighty men,....

But it is clear from <a href="/isaiah/3-2.htm">Isaiah 3:2</a> that the "mighty men" were recognized as an important part of the community. From <a href="/1_chronicles/10-10.htm">1 Chronicles 10:10</a> it appears that the term indicates a position of high command in the army, which is in accordance with the notice in <a href="/2_kings/24-16.htm">2 Kings 24:16</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Went into Egypt</span>. Egypt was the natural refuge for a native of Palestine (comp. <a href="/1_kings/11-17.htm">1 Kings 11:17, 40</a> Matt, 2:14), just as Palestine was for a native of Egypt. The latter, however, proved to be not a safe asylum for Urijah, as Pharaoh was the liege lord of Jehoiakim (<a href="/2_kings/23-34.htm">2 Kings 23:34</a>), and the extradition of Urijah as a criminal naturally followed. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/26.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Before these princes, about whom all the people gathered, Jeremiah is accused by the priests and prophets: "This man is worthy of death;" literally: a sentence of death (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/19-6.htm">Deuteronomy 19:6</a>), condemnation to death, is due to this man; "for he hath prophesied against this city, as ye have heard with your ears." With these last words they appeal to the people standing round who had heard the prophecy, for the princes had not reached the temple till after Jeremiah had been apprehended. <a href="/jeremiah/26-12.htm">Jeremiah 26:12</a>. To this Jeremiah answered in his own defence before the princes and all the people: "Jahveh hath sent me to prophesy against (&#1488;&#1500; for &#1506;&#1500;) this house and against this city all the words which ye have heard. <a href="/jeremiah/26-13.htm">Jeremiah 26:13</a>. And now make your ways good and your doings, and hearken to the voice of Jahveh your God, and Jahveh will repent Him of the evil that He hath spoken against you. <a href="/jeremiah/26-14.htm">Jeremiah 26:14</a>. But I, behold, I am in your hand; do with me as seemeth to you good and right. <a href="/jeremiah/26-15.htm">Jeremiah 26:15</a>. Only ye must know, that if ye put me to death, ye bring innocent blood upon you, and upon this city, and upon her inhabitants; for of a truth Jahveh hath sent me to you to speak in your ears all these words." - As to "make your ways good," cf. <a href="/jeremiah/7-3.htm">Jeremiah 7:3</a>. This defence made an impression on the princes and on all the people. From the intimation that by reform it was possible to avert the threatened calamity, and from the appeal to the fact that in truth Jahveh had sent him and commanded him so to speak, they see that he is a true prophet, whose violent death would bring blood-guiltiness upon the city and its inhabitants. They therefore declare to the accusers, <a href="/jeremiah/26-16.htm">Jeremiah 26:16</a> : "This man is not worthy of death, for in the name of Jahveh our God hath he spoken unto us."</body></html>
