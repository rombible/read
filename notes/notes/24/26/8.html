The elders of Israel came to inquire into this matter. Jeremiah declares that the Lord sent him to prophesy thus. As long as ministers keep close to the word they have from God, they need not fear. And those are very unjust who complain of ministers for preaching of hell and damnation; for it is from a desire to bring them to heaven and salvation. Jeremiah warns them of their danger if they go on against him. All men may know, that to hurt, or put to death, or to show hatred to their faithful reprovers, will hasten and increase their own punishment.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div><a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/26.htm">Jeremiah 26</a> is a narrative of the danger to which Jeremiah was exposed by reason of the prophecy contained in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/7.htm">Jeremiah 7</a> and should be read in connection with it. <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-4.htm">Jeremiah 26:4-6</a> contain a summary of the prediction contained in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/7.htm">Jeremiah 7</a>, and that again is but an outline of what was a long address. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/26.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. priests&#8212;The captain (or prefect) of the temple had the power of apprehending offenders in the temple with the sanction of the priests.<p>prophets&#8212;the false prophets. The charge against Jeremiah was that of uttering falsehood in Jehovah's name, an act punishable with death (De 18:20).

They allowed Jeremiah to finish his discourse (of which we have here only the briefest summary), either from a lingering reverence for his person and office, or to obtain fuller materials for an accusation (comp. the trial of Stephen, <a href="/acts/6-12.htm">Acts 6:12-14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">All the people</span>. The "people" appear to have been always under some constraint. As long as the priests and prophets were alone, they dominated the unofficial classes, but when the princes appeared (ver. 11), the new influence proved superior.

Death was the legal penalty both for blasphemy (<a href="/leviticus/24-16.htm">Leviticus 24:16</a>) and for presuming to prophesy without having received a prophetic revelation (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-20.htm">Deuteronomy 18:20</a>). Jeremiah's declaration ran so entirely counter to the prejudices of his hearers that he may well have been accused of both these sins, or crimes. True, Isaiah and Amos had already predicted the destruction of Jerusalem (<a href="/isaiah/5-5.htm">Isaiah 5:5, 6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/6-11.htm">Isaiah 6:11</a>; <a href="/amos/2-4.htm">Amos 2:4, 5</a>; <a href="/amos/6-1.htm">Amos 6:1, 2</a>); but it may have been contended that the timely repentance of Judah under Hezekiah and Josiah had effectually cancelled the threatened doom, and though <a href="/isaiah/64-10.htm">Isaiah 64:10, 11</a> evidently refers to a time later than Josiah, and represents the ruin of Jerusalem as practically certain, it would seem that the prophetic book (<a href="/isaiah/40.htm">Isaiah 40-66</a>.) to which this belongs (to say the least) was not generally known. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/26.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Accusation and Acquittal of Jeremiah. - <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-1.htm">Jeremiah 26:1-7</a>. His prophecy that temple and city would be destroyed gave occasion to the accusation of the prophet. - <a href="/jeremiah/26-1.htm">Jeremiah 26:1</a>. "In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah king of Judah, came this word from Jahveh, saying: <a href="/jeremiah/26-2.htm">Jeremiah 26:2</a>. Thus said Jahveh: Stand in the court of the house of Jahveh, and speak to all the cities of Judah which come to worship in Jahveh's house, all the words that I have commanded thee to speak to them; take not a word therefrom. <a href="/jeremiah/26-3.htm">Jeremiah 26:3</a>. Perchance they will hearken and turn each from his evil way, that I may repent me of the evil which I purpose to do unto them for the evil of their doings. <a href="/jeremiah/26-4.htm">Jeremiah 26:4</a>. And say unto them: Thus saith Jahveh: If ye hearken not to me, to walk in my law which I have set before you, <a href="/jeremiah/26-5.htm">Jeremiah 26:5</a>. To hearken to the words of my servants the prophets whom I sent unto you, from early morning on sending, but ye have not hearkened. <a href="/jeremiah/26-6.htm">Jeremiah 26:6</a>. Then I make this house like Shiloh, and this city a curse to all the peoples of the earth. <a href="/jeremiah/26-7.htm">Jeremiah 26:7</a>. And the priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of Jahveh."<p>In the discourse of <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/7.htm">Jeremiah 7</a>, where he was combating the people's false reliance upon the temple, Jeremiah had already threatened that the temple should share the fate of Shiloh, unless the people turned from its evil ways. Now, since that discourse was also delivered in the temple, and since <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-2.htm">Jeremiah 26:2-6</a> of the present chapter manifestly communicate only the substance of what the prophet said, several comm. have held these discourses to be identical, and have taken it for granted that the discourse here referred to, belonging to the beginning of Jehoiakim's reign, was given in full in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/7.htm">Jeremiah 7</a>, while the history of it has been given in the present chapter by way of supplement (cf. the introductory remarks to <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/7.htm">Jeremiah 7</a>). But considering that it is a peculiarity of Jeremiah frequently to repeat certain of the main thoughts of his message, the saying of God, that He will do to the temple as He has done to Shiloh, is not sufficient to warrant this assumption. Jeremiah frequently held discourses in the temple, and more than once foretold the destruction of Jerusalem; so that it need not be surprising if on more than one occasion he threatened the temple with the fate of Shiloh. Between the two discourses there is further this distinction: Whereas in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/7.htm">Jeremiah 7</a> the prophet speaks chiefly of the spoliation or destruction of the temple and the expulsion of the people into exile, here in brief incisive words he intimates the destruction of the city of Jerusalem as well; and the present chapter throughout gives the impression that by this, so to speak, peremptory declaration, the prophet sought to move the people finally to decide for Jahveh its God, and that he thus so exasperated the priests and prophets present, that they seized him and pronounced him worthy of death. - According to the heading, this took place in the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim. The like specification in the heading of <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/27.htm">Jeremiah 27</a> does not warrant us to refer the date to the fourth year of this king. "The beginning" intimates simply that the discourse belongs to the earlier period of Jehoiakim's reign, without minuter information as to year and day. "To Jeremiah" seems to have been dropped out after "came this word," <a href="/jeremiah/26-1.htm">Jeremiah 26:1</a>. The court of the house of God is not necessarily the inner or priests' court of the temple; it may have been the outer one where the people assembled; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/19-14.htm">Jeremiah 19:14</a>. All the "cities of Judah" for their inhabitants, as in <a href="/jeremiah/11-12.htm">Jeremiah 11:12</a>. The addition: "take not a word therefrom," cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/4-2.htm">Deuteronomy 4:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/13-1.htm">Deuteronomy 13:1</a>, indicates the peremptory character of the discourse. In full, without softening the threat by the omission of anything the Lord commanded him, i.e., he is to proclaim the word of the Lord in its full unconditional severity, to move the people, if possible, to repentance, acc. to <a href="/jeremiah/26-3.htm">Jeremiah 26:3</a>. With <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-3.htm">Jeremiah 26:3</a>, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-8.htm">Jeremiah 18:8</a>, etc. - In <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-4.htm">Jeremiah 26:4-6</a> we have the contents of the discourse. If they hearken not to the words of the prophet, as has hitherto been the case, the Lord will make the temple as Shiloh, and this city, i.e., Jerusalem, a curse, i.e., an object of curses (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/24-9.htm">Jeremiah 24:9</a>), for all peoples. On this cf. <a href="/jeremiah/7-12.htm">Jeremiah 7:12</a>. But ye have not hearkened.
