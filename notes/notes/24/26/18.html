The words cited are from <a href="/micah/3-12.htm" title="Therefore shall Zion for your sake be plowed as a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of the forest.">Micah 3:12</a>, and immediately precede the prediction of an ultimate restoration of Judah in the last days in <a href="/context/micah/4-1.htm" title="But in the last days it shall come to pass, that the mountain of the house of the LORD shall be established in the top of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and people shall flow to it.">Micah 4:1-2</a>, which we find in identical terms in <a href="/context/isaiah/2-2.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the LORD's house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow to it.">Isaiah 2:2-3</a>. Here, then, was a case, is the implied argument of the elders, in which a threat did its work, and therefore was not fulfilled. It did good, and not evil. The phrase “mountain of the house” is not found elsewhere in Jeremiah as a description of the Temple.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/26.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>26:16-24 When secure sinners are threatened with taking away the Spirit of God, and the kingdom of God, it is what is warranted from the word of God. Hezekiah who protected Micah, prospered. Did Jehoiakim, who slew Urijah, prosper? The examples of bad men, and the bad consequences of their sins, should deter from what is evil. Urijah was faithful in delivering his message, but faulty in leaving his work. And the Lord was pleased to permit him to lose his life, while Jeremiah was protected in danger. Those are safest who most simply trust in the Lord, whatever their outward circumstances may be; and that He has all men's hearts in his hands, encourages us to trust him in the way of duty. He will honour and recompense those who show kindness to such as are persecuted for his sake.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The elders of the land - The heads and spokesmen of the congregation, who added their approval after the princes who represented the king had given their decision. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/26.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18.

Or, Micah of Maresha, as the Targum. Mareshah was a city of the tribe of Judah, <a href="/joshua/15-44.htm">Joshua 15:44</a>; the native place, of this prophet; who appears, by the following quotation, to be the same Micah that stands among the minor prophets; and who is also so called, and lived in the times of Hezekiah, <a href="/micah/1-1.htm">Micah 1:1</a>; <p>and spake to all the people of Judah; very openly and publicly, and just as Jeremiah had done, <a href="/jeremiah/26-2.htm">Jeremiah 26:2</a>; <p>saying, thus saith the Lord of hosts, Zion shall be ploughed like a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps; Mount Zion, on part of which the temple was built, and on the other the city of David, together with the city of Jerusalem, should be so demolished, as that they might be ploughed, and become a tillage; as the Jews say they were by Terentius, or Turnus Rufus, as they call him, after their last destruction by the Romans: <p>and the mountain of the house as the high places of the forest; covered with grass and shrubs, and thorns and briers; even Mount Moriah, on which the temple stood, which is designed by the house; and so the Targum calls it the house of the sanctuary. Now this was saying as much against the city and temple as Jeremiah did; and was said in the days of a good king too, who encouraged a reformation, and carried it to a great pitch.

The prediction referred to is in <a href="/micah/3-12.htm">Micah 3:12</a>, the form of which agrees verbally with our passage. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/26.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Before these princes, about whom all the people gathered, Jeremiah is accused by the priests and prophets: "This man is worthy of death;" literally: a sentence of death (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/19-6.htm">Deuteronomy 19:6</a>), condemnation to death, is due to this man; "for he hath prophesied against this city, as ye have heard with your ears." With these last words they appeal to the people standing round who had heard the prophecy, for the princes had not reached the temple till after Jeremiah had been apprehended. <a href="/jeremiah/26-12.htm">Jeremiah 26:12</a>. To this Jeremiah answered in his own defence before the princes and all the people: "Jahveh hath sent me to prophesy against (&#1488;&#1500; for &#1506;&#1500;) this house and against this city all the words which ye have heard. <a href="/jeremiah/26-13.htm">Jeremiah 26:13</a>. And now make your ways good and your doings, and hearken to the voice of Jahveh your God, and Jahveh will repent Him of the evil that He hath spoken against you. <a href="/jeremiah/26-14.htm">Jeremiah 26:14</a>. But I, behold, I am in your hand; do with me as seemeth to you good and right. <a href="/jeremiah/26-15.htm">Jeremiah 26:15</a>. Only ye must know, that if ye put me to death, ye bring innocent blood upon you, and upon this city, and upon her inhabitants; for of a truth Jahveh hath sent me to you to speak in your ears all these words." - As to "make your ways good," cf. <a href="/jeremiah/7-3.htm">Jeremiah 7:3</a>. This defence made an impression on the princes and on all the people. From the intimation that by reform it was possible to avert the threatened calamity, and from the appeal to the fact that in truth Jahveh had sent him and commanded him so to speak, they see that he is a true prophet, whose violent death would bring blood-guiltiness upon the city and its inhabitants. They therefore declare to the accusers, <a href="/jeremiah/26-16.htm">Jeremiah 26:16</a> : "This man is not worthy of death, for in the name of Jahveh our God hath he spoken unto us."</body></html>
