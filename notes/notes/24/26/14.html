The elders of Israel came to inquire into this matter. Jeremiah declares that the Lord sent him to prophesy thus. As long as ministers keep close to the word they have from God, they need not fear. And those are very unjust who complain of ministers for preaching of hell and damnation; for it is from a desire to bring them to heaven and salvation. Jeremiah warns them of their danger if they go on against him. All men may know, that to hurt, or put to death, or to show hatred to their faithful reprovers, will hasten and increase their own punishment.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The answer of Jeremiah is simple and straightforward. Yahweh, he affirmed, had truly sent him, but the sole object of his prophesying had been to avert the evil by leading them to repentance. If they would amend their ways God would deliver them from the threatened doom. As for himself he was in their hands, but if they put him to death they would bring the guilt of shedding innocent blood upon themselves and upon the city. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/26.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14.

When the priests and prophets and all the people present in the temple had heard this discourse, they laid hold of Jeremiah, saying, "Thou must die. Wherefore prophesiest thou in the name of Jahveh, saying, Like Shiloh shall this house become, and this city shall be desolate, without inhabitant? And all the people gathered to Jeremiah in the house of Jahveh." This last remark is not so to be understood, when compared with <a href="/jeremiah/26-7.htm">Jeremiah 26:7</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-8.htm">Jeremiah 26:8</a>, as that all the people who, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-7.htm">Jeremiah 26:7</a>, had been hearing the discourse, and, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-8.htm">Jeremiah 26:8</a>, had with the priests and prophets laid hold on Jeremiah, gathered themselves to him now. It means, that after one part of the people present had, along with the priests and prophets, laid hold on him, the whole people gathered around him. "All the people," <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-9.htm">Jeremiah 26:9</a>, is accordingly to be distinguished from "all the people," <a href="/jeremiah/26-8.htm">Jeremiah 26:8</a>; and the word &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;, all, must not be pressed, in both cases meaning simply a great many. When it is thus taken, there is no reason for following Hitz., and deleting "all the people" in <a href="/jeremiah/26-8.htm">Jeremiah 26:8</a> as a gloss. Jeremiah's special opponents were the priests and prophets after their own hearts. But to them there adhered many from among the people; and these it is that are meant by "all the people," <a href="/jeremiah/26-8.htm">Jeremiah 26:8</a>. But since these partisans of the priests and pseudo-prophets had no independent power of their own to pass judgment, and since, after Jeremiah was laid hold of, all the rest of the people then in the temple gathered around him, it happens that in <a href="/jeremiah/26-11.htm">Jeremiah 26:11</a> the priests and prophets are opposed to "all the people," and are mentioned as being alone the accusers of Jeremiah. - When the princes of Judah heard what had occurred, they repaired from the king's house (the palace) to the temple, and seated themselves in the entry of the new gate of Jahve, sc. to investigate and decide the case. The new gate was, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-10.htm">Jeremiah 36:10</a>, by the upper, i.e., inner court, and is doubtless the same that Jotham caused to be built (<a href="/2_kings/15-35.htm">2 Kings 15:35</a>); but whether it was identical with the upper gate of Benjamin, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-2.htm">Jeremiah 20:2</a>, cannot be decided. The princes of Judah, since they came up into the temple from the palace, are the judicial officers who were at that time about the palace. the judges were chosen from among the heads of the people; cf. my Bibl. Archol. ii.149</body></html>
