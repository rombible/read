"None at all is like Thee, Jahveh; great art Thou, and Thy name is great in might. <a href="/jeremiah/10-7.htm">Jeremiah 10:7</a>. Who would not fear Thee, Thou King of the peoples? To Thee doth it appertain; for among all the wise men of the peoples, and in all their kingdoms, there is none at all like unto Thee. <a href="/jeremiah/10-8.htm">Jeremiah 10:8</a>. But they are all together brutish and foolish; the teaching of the vanities is wood. <a href="/jeremiah/10-9.htm">Jeremiah 10:9</a>. Beaten silver, from Tarshish it is brought, and gold from Uphaz, work of the craftsman and of the hands of the goldsmith; blue and red purple is their clothing; the work of cunning workmen are they all. <a href="/jeremiah/10-10.htm">Jeremiah 10:10</a>. But Jahveh is God in truth, He is living God and everlasting King; at His wrath the earth trembles, and the peoples abide not His indignation. <a href="/jeremiah/10-11.htm">Jeremiah 10:11</a>. Thus shall ye say unto them: The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, these shall perish from the earth and from under the heavens."<p>In this second strophe Jahveh is contrasted, as the only true God and Lord of the world, with the lifeless gods. These there is no need to fear, but it behoves all to fear the almighty God, since in His wrath He can destroy nations. When compared with <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/86-8.htm">Psalm 86:8</a>, the &#1502;&#1503; in &#1502;&#1488;&#1497;&#1503; seems redundant - so much so, that Ven. pronounces it a copyist's error, and Hitz. sets it aside by changing the vowels. The word as it stands contains a double negation, and is usually found only in dependent clauses with a strong negative force: so that there is none. Here it has the same force, but at the beginning of the sentence: none at all is as Thou; cf. Ew. 323, a. Great is Thy name, i.e., the manifestation of Thee in the world, in Thy government of the earth. "In (or with) might" belongs to "great:" great with might, displaying itself in acts of might; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/16-21.htm">Jeremiah 16:21</a>. Who would not fear Thee? a negative setting of the thought: every one must fear Thee. King of the nations; cf. <a href="/psalms/22-29.htm">Psalm 22:29</a>; <a href="/psalms/47-8.htm">Psalm 47:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/96-10.htm">Psalm 96:10</a>. &#1497;&#1488;&#1514;&#1492; from &#1497;&#1488;&#1492;, &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;.. equivalent to &#1504;&#1488;&#1492; (whence &#1504;&#1488;&#1493;&#1492;), to be seemly, suitable. Among the wise men of the peoples none is like Thee, so as that any should be able to make head against Thee by any clever stroke; cf. <a href="/isaiah/19-12.htm">Isaiah 19:12</a>; <a href="/isaiah/29-14.htm">Isaiah 29:14</a>. Nor is there in any kingdom of the peoples any one like Jahveh, i.e., in might. It is not merely earthly kings that are meant, but the gods of the heathen as well. In no heathen kingdom is there any power to be compared with Jahveh. We are led here to think also of the pagan gods by <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-8.htm">Jeremiah 10:8</a>, where the wisdom and almighty power of the living God are contrasted with foolishness and vanity of the false gods. &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1495;&#1514; is not: in uno  equals  in una re, sc. idololatria (Rabb.); nor is it, as Hitz. in most strained fashion makes it: by means of one thing, i.e., by (or at) a single word, the word which comes immediately after: it is wood. &#1488;&#1495;&#1514; is unquestionably neuter, and the force of it here is collective,  equals  all together, like the Chald. &#1499;&#1495;&#1491;&#1488;. The nominative to "are brutish" is "the peoples." The verb &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512; is denom. from &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512;, to be brutish, occurring elsewhere in the Kal only in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/94-8.htm">Psalm 94:8</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/21-36.htm">Ezekiel 21:36</a>; in the Niph. <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-14.htm">Jeremiah 10:14</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-21.htm">Jeremiah 10:21</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/51-17.htm">Jeremiah 51:17</a>; <a href="/isaiah/19-11.htm">Isaiah 19:11</a>. &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1500; as verb is found only here; elsewhere we have &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1497;&#1500;, foolish, and &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1500;, folly (Sol 7:1-13 :25), and, as a verb, the transposed form &#1505;&#1499;&#1500;. The remaining words of the verse make up one clause; the construction is the same as in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-3.htm">Jeremiah 10:3</a>, but the sense is not: "a mere vain doctrine is the wood," i.e., the idol is itself but a doctrine of vanities. In this way Ew. takes it, making "wood" the subject of the clause and &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1512; the predicate. &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1512; &#1492;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; is the antithesis to &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1512; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;, <a href="/deuteronomy/11-2.htm">Deuteronomy 11:2</a>; <a href="/proverbs/3-11.htm">Proverbs 3:11</a>; <a href="/job/5-17.htm">Job 5:17</a>. As the latter is the &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; of the Lord, so the former is the &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; of the false gods (&#1492;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, cf. <a href="/jeremiah/8-19.htm">Jeremiah 8:19</a>). The &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; of Jahveh displayed itself, acc. to <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-2.htm">Deuteronomy 11:2</a>, in deeds of might by means of which Jahveh set His people Israel free from the power of Egypt. Consequently it is the education of Israel by means of acts of love and chastenings, or, taken more generally, the divine leading and guidance of the people. Such a &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; the null and void gods could not give to their worshippers. Their &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; is wood, i.e., not: wooden, but nothing else than that which the gods themselves are - wood, which, however it be decked up (<a href="/jeremiah/10-9.htm">Jeremiah 10:9</a>), remains a mere lifeless block. So that the thought of <a href="/jeremiah/10-8.htm">Jeremiah 10:8</a> is this: The heathen, with all their wise men, are brutish; since their gods, from which they should receive wisdom and instruction, are wood. Starting from this, <a href="/jeremiah/10-9.htm">Jeremiah 10:9</a> continues to this effect: However much this wood be decked out with silver, gold, and purple raiment, it remains but the product of men's hands; by no such process does the wood become a god. The description of the polishing off of the wood into a god is loosely attached to the predicate &#1506;&#1509;, by way of an enumeration of the various things made use of therefore. The specification served to make the picture the more graphic; what idols were made of was familiar to everybody. &#1502;&#1512;&#1511;&#1468;&#1506;, beat out into thin plates for coating over the wooden image; cf. <a href="/exodus/39-3.htm">Exodus 39:3</a>; <a href="/numbers/17-3.htm">Numbers 17:3</a>.
