A catalogue of the seventy standard astrological tablets is to be found in the third volume of the British Museum collection of inscriptions.

"Thus hath Jahveh said: Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, and let not the strong man glory in his strength; let not the rich man glory in his riches: <a href="/jeremiah/9-23.htm">Jeremiah 9:23</a>. But let him that glorieth glory in this, in having understanding, and in knowing me, that I am Jahveh, dealing grace, right, and justice upon earth; for therein have I pleasure, saith Jahveh. <a href="/jeremiah/9-24.htm">Jeremiah 9:24</a>. Behold, days come, saith Jahveh, that I punish all the circumcised (who are) with foreskin, <a href="/jeremiah/9-25.htm">Jeremiah 9:25</a>. Egypt, and Judah, and Edom, and the sons of Ammon, Moab and them that have their hair-corners polled, that dwell in the wilderness; for all the heathen are uncircumcised, and the whole house of Israel is uncircumcised in heart."<p>After having overturned the foundations of the people's false reliance on the temple, or the sacrifices, and in the wisdom of its leaders, Jeremiah finally points out the way that leads to safety. This consists solely in the true knowledge of the Lord who doth grace, right, and justice, and therein hath pleasure. In <a href="/jeremiah/9-23.htm">Jeremiah 9:23</a> he mentions the delusive objects of confidence on which the children of this world are wont to pride themselves: their own wisdom, strength, and riches. These things do not save from ruin. Safety is secured only by "having understanding and knowing me." These two ideas are so closely connected, that the second may be looked on as giving the nearer definition of the first. The having of understanding must manifest itself in the knowing of the Lord. The two verbs are in the infin. abs., because all that was necessary was to suggest the idea expressed by the verb; cf. Ew. 328, b. The knowledge of God consists in knowing Him as Him who doth grace, right, and justice upon earth. &#1495;&#1505;&#1491;, grace, favour, is the foundation on which right and justice are based; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/32-18.htm">Jeremiah 32:18</a>; <a href="/psalms/33-5.htm">Psalm 33:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/99-4.htm">Psalm 99:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/103-6.htm">Psalm 103:6</a>. He who has attained to this knowledge will seek to practise these virtues towards his fellow-men, because only therein has God pleasure (&#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; pointing back to the objects before mentioned); cf. <a href="/jeremiah/22-3.htm">Jeremiah 22:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/11-7.htm">Psalm 11:7</a>; <a href="/psalms/37-28.htm">Psalm 37:28</a>. But because the Lord has pleasure in right and justice, He will punish all peoples that do not practise justice. </body></html>
