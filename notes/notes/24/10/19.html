But, sooner or later, sinners will find all things as the word of God has declared, and that its threatenings are not empty terrors. Submission will support the believer under every grief allotted to him; but what can render the load of Divine vengeance easy to be borne by those who fall under it in sullen despair? Those cannot expect to prosper, who do not, by faith and prayer, take God with them in all their ways. The report of the enemy's approach was very dreadful. Yet the designs which men lay deep, and think well formed, are dashed to pieces in a moment. Events are often overruled, so as to be quite contrary to what we intended and expected. If the Lord has directed our steps into the ways of peace and righteousness, let us entreat him to enable us to walk therein. Say not, Lord, do not correct me; but, Lord, do not correct me in anger. We may bear the smart of God's rod, but we cannot bear the weight of his wrath. Those who restrain prayer, prove that they know not God; for those who know him will seek him, and seek his favour. If even severe corrections lead sinners to be convinced of wholesome truths, they will have abundant cause for gratitude. And they will then humble themselves before the Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The lamentation of the daughter of Zion, the Jewish Church, at the devastation of the land, and her humble prayer to God for mercy.<p><a href="/jeremiah/10-19.htm">Jeremiah 10:19</a><p>Grievous - Rather, "mortal," i. e., fatal, incurable.<p>A grief - Or, "my grief."<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19.

The subject to &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; and the following verbs is not expressed, but may be supplied from the contrasted statement of <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-11.htm">Jeremiah 10:11</a>, or from the substance of the several statements in <a href="/jeremiah/10-12.htm">Jeremiah 10:12</a>. The connection may be taken thus: The true God is the one making the earth by His power  equals  is He that made, etc. As the creation of the earth is a work of God's almighty power, so the establishing, the founding of it upon the waters (<a href="/psalms/24-2.htm">Psalm 24:2</a>) is an act of divine wisdom, and the stretching out of the heavens over the earth like a tent (<a href="/isaiah/40-22.htm">Isaiah 40:22</a>; <a href="/psalms/104-2.htm">Psalm 104:2</a>) is a work of intelligent design. On this cf. <a href="/isaiah/42-5.htm">Isaiah 42:5</a>; <a href="/isaiah/44-24.htm">Isaiah 44:24</a>; <a href="/isaiah/45-18.htm">Isaiah 45:18</a>; <a href="/isaiah/51-13.htm">Isaiah 51:13</a>. Every thunder-storm bears witness to the wise and almighty government of God, <a href="/jeremiah/10-13.htm">Jeremiah 10:13</a>. The words &#1500;&#1511;&#1493;&#1500;  are difficult. Acc. to Ew. &#1431;307, b, they stand for &#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493; &#1511;&#1493;&#1500;: when He gives His voice, i.e., when He thunders. In support of this it may be said, that the mention of lightnings, rain, and wind suggests such an interpretation. But the transposition of the words cannot be justified. Hitz. has justly remarked: The putting of the accusative first, taken by itself, might do; but not when it must at the same time be stat. constr., and when its genitive thus separated from it would assume the appearance of being an accusative to &#1514;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;. Besides, we would expect &#1500;&#1514;&#1514; &#1511;&#1493;&#1500;&#1493; rather than &#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493; &#1511;&#1493;&#1500;. &#1511;&#1493;&#1500; &#1514;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493; cannot grammatically be rendered: the voice which He gives, as Ng. would have it, but: the voice of His giving; and "roar of waters" must be the accusative of the object, governed by &#1514;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;. Hence we must protest against the explanation of L. de Dieu: ad vocem dationis ejus multitudo aquarum est in caelo, at least if ad vocem dationis is tantamount to simul ac dat. Just as little can &#1500;&#1511;&#1493;&#1500; taken by itself mean thunder, so that ad vocem should, with Schnur., be interpreted by tonitru est dare ejus multitudinem aquae. The only grammatically feasible explanation is the second of those proposed by L. de Dieu: ad vocem dandi ipsum, i.e., qua dat vel ponit multitudinem aquarum. So Hitz.: at the roar of His giving wealth of waters. Accordingly we expound: at the noise, when He gives the roar of waters in heaven, He raises up clouds from the ends of the earth; taking, as we do, the &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492; to be a &#1493; consec. introducing the supplementary clause. The voice or noise with which God gives the roar or the fulness of waters in the heaven, is the sound of the thunder. With this the gathering of the dark thunder-clouds is put into causal connection, as it appears to be to the eye; for during the thunder we see the thunder-clouds gather thicker and darker on the horizon. &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1488;, the ascended, poetic word for cloud. Lightnings for the rain; i.e., since the rain comes as a consequence of the lightning, for the lightning seems to rend the clouds and let them pour their water out on the earth. Thunder-storms are always accompanied by a strong wind. God causes the wind to go forth from His store-chambers, where He has it also under custody, and blow over the earth. See a like simile of the store-chambers of the snow and hail, <a href="/job/38-22.htm">Job 38:22</a>. From &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492; onwards, this verse is repeated in <a href="/psalms/135-7.htm">Psalm 135:7</a>.</body></html>
