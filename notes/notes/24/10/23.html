The two Hebrew words for “man” are used in the two clauses, the first expressing the weakness, the latter the strength of men. Even the strong man has to confess that he needs a hand other than his own to direct his steps.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/10.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/jeremiah/10-23.htm" title="O LORD, I know that the way of man is not in himself: it is not in man that walks to direct his steps.">Jeremiah 10:23</a></span>. <span class="ital">O Lord, I know, </span>&c. — The prophet now turns to God, and addresses himself to him, finding it to little purpose to speak to the people. It is some comfort to poor ministers, that, if men will not hear them, God will; and to him they have liberty of access at all times. Let them close their preaching with prayer, as the prophet here does, and then they will have no reason to complain that they have laboured in vain. <span class="ital">That the way of man is not in himself </span>— The prophet must here be considered as acknowledging the superintendence and dominion of the divine providence; that by it, and not by their own will and wisdom, the affairs both of nations and particular persons are directed and governed. His words in this verse, taken in connection with the following, may be thus paraphrased: Thy providence, O Lord, superintends all events; all that happens comes to pass through thy permission or appointment. It is not in man to hinder that which has been once resolved on in thy decrees. We know, therefore, that it is not in our power to divert those judgments which are coming upon us, but thou canst moderate and limit them as thou pleasest. If, then, it be thy will that we should feel the awful effects of thy justice, chastise us, but spare our weakness; <span class="ital">correct us, but with judgment, not in thine anger, </span>&c. Theodoret applies this to Nebuchadnezzar, and explains the passage thus: “We know, O Lord, that the prince whom thou sendest against us comes not without thy orders; that the success of his arms, and the good fortune of his enterprise, proceed only from thee: but deliver us, O Lord, from this terrible enemy; and if we have merited chastisement, may we receive it at thy hand. Punish us as a father, and not as a judge.” The words, however, are applicable to us all, as well as to Nebuchadnezzar and the Jews. We are not at our own disposal, nor able to direct our own way by our own wisdom, either in matters temporal or spiritual. Nor are we at liberty to choose what line of life we please, or to ensure to ourselves the success and prosperity we may desire. We are under God’s government, and at his disposal, and have continual need of his direction, and of the influence of his grace, without which we shall certainly err from the right way, and shall neither choose nor perform what is truly and lastingly good, and for our happiness.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:17-25 The Jews who continued in their own land, felt secure. But, sooner or later, sinners will find all things as the word of God has declared, and that its threatenings are not empty terrors. Submission will support the believer under every grief allotted to him; but what can render the load of Divine vengeance easy to be borne by those who fall under it in sullen despair? Those cannot expect to prosper, who do not, by faith and prayer, take God with them in all their ways. The report of the enemy's approach was very dreadful. Yet the designs which men lay deep, and think well formed, are dashed to pieces in a moment. Events are often overruled, so as to be quite contrary to what we intended and expected. If the Lord has directed our steps into the ways of peace and righteousness, let us entreat him to enable us to walk therein. Say not, Lord, do not correct me; but, Lord, do not correct me in anger. We may bear the smart of God's rod, but we cannot bear the weight of his wrath. Those who restrain prayer, prove that they know not God; for those who know him will seek him, and seek his favour. If even severe corrections lead sinners to be convinced of wholesome truths, they will have abundant cause for gratitude. And they will then humble themselves before the Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>At the rumour of the enemy's approach Jeremiah utters in the name of the nation a supplication appropriate to men overtaken by the divine justice.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>23.

How far these words concern Pelagianism, or free-will, either one way or other, or whether at all, concerns not this comment; they seem literally to be the words of the prophet, relating either to himself and other holy men: q.d. It is not in our power, neither do we presume, to stop this decree of thine against Judea: or else to the enemies in general, or Nebuchadnezzar in particular: q.d. We know all their marches and designs are of thine appointing, and all their achievements of thine ordering, it is thy providence that directs every <span class="ital">step</span> they take against this land, without whom no counsels shall prosper, who alone turnest men’s hearts which way thou pleasest, <span class="bld"><a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm" title="The king's heart is in the hand of the LORD, as the rivers of water: he turns it wherever he will.">Proverbs 21:1</a></span>, who canst bring men on, or turn them back, as thou seest good, <span class="bld"><a href="/isaiah/37-29.htm" title="Because your rage against me, and your tumult, is come up into my ears, therefore will I put my hook in your nose, and my bridle in your lips, and I will turn you back by the way by which you came.">Isaiah 37:29</a></span>, so that no man’s way is properly his own, to give them what success he will: or to the people, whereby he doth tacitly insinuate that all the counsels and measures they think to take, whether by their own strength at home, or confederacies and alliances abroad, will avail nothing; however they may think to escape by some devices or stratagems of their own, it is to no purpose, God can overturn all in a moment, when men think their counsels are ripe, and they want nothing but execution: or lastly, as others think, this is by way of petition: q.d. Lord, we know it is not in our power to divert these judgments that are coming upon us by the Chaldeans, but thou canst moderate and limit them as thou pleasest; seeing all their designs are ordered by thy providence, they cannot do any thing against us without thy permission: this the next verse seems to favour. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>O Lord, I know that the way of man is not in himself,.... Kimchi and Ben Melech interpret it of that well known man Nebuchadnezzar, whose way was not in himself, and was not master of his own resolutions, but was under the influence and direction of divine Providence: when he set out of Babylon, he thought to have gone against the Ammonites; but when he came to a place where two ways met; the one leading to the children of Ammon, the other to Jerusalem; God changed his mind, and he steered his course to Jerusalem, to chastise Zedekiah for the breach of his oath: but the words seem to have a more general meaning; and the sense to be, that the prophet knew that it was not with him, nor with any of the godly, to escape the judgments that were coming upon them; that they were entirely in the hands of the Lord, to be guided, directed, and disposed of at his pleasure. The words may be accommodated to spiritual things and the affair of salvation; and be rendered thus, "I know, O Lord, that not for man is his way" (d); his own way is not good for him; not his sinful way, for this is opposite to God's way, and a going out of it; it is not according to his word; it is after the course of the world; and it is a dark and crooked way, and leads to, and ends in, destruction and death, if grace prevent not: nor the way of his own righteousness; this is no way of access to God, no way of acceptance with him, no way of justification before him, no way of salvation, no way to heaven, and eternal happiness; that which is the good and right way, the only way of salvation, is not of man, in him, or with him naturally; it is not of his devising and contriving, and much less of his effecting; it is not even within his knowledge; and so far as he knows anything of it, he does not approve of it: but it is of God; the scheme of it is of his forming; it is a work wrought out by Christ; it is a way of salvation revealed in the Gospel; and the thing itself is savingly made known, and applied by the Spirit of God; all which is known and owned when men are spiritually enlightened: <p>it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps; as not in natural and civil things, much less in religious ones; a good man is one that "walks", which supposes life and strength, without which there can be no walking; and a progression, a going on in a way; which ways are Christ, and his ordinances the path of doctrine and of duty; yet it is not even in this good man "to direct" and order "his steps" of himself; it is the Lord that must do it, and does; he can take no step aright without him; he is guided by him and his Spirit, both in the path of truth and of obedience; and hence it is that the saints persevere unto the end; see <a href="/psalms/37-23.htm">Psalm 37:23</a>. <p>(d)      "novi, Jehovah, quod non sit homini via ejus", Schmidt; so Vatablus, Cocceius. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/10.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">O LORD, I know that <span class="cverse3">{p}</span> the way of man <i>is</i> not in himself: <i>it is</i> not in man that walketh to direct his steps.</span><p>(p) He speaks this because Nebuchadnezzar purposed to have made war against the Moabites and Ammonites, but hearing of Zedekiah's rebellion he turned his power to go against Jerusalem, Eze 21:21 therefore the prophet says that this was the Lord's direction.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/10.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">23</span>.

Stade, Du. and others (so Gi. in 1905, see his <span class="ital">Metrik</span>, p. 23) consider the passage to be the work of a supplementer. Gi. already in his Commentary (1894) surrenders <span class="ital"><a href="/jeremiah/10-25.htm" title="Pour out your fury on the heathen that know you not, and on the families that call not on your name: for they have eaten up Jacob, and devoured him, and consumed him, and have made his habitation desolate.">Jeremiah 10:25</a></span>, probably rightly, while <span class="ital"><a href="/context/jeremiah/10-23.htm" title="O LORD, I know that the way of man is not in himself: it is not in man that walks to direct his steps....">Jeremiah 10:23-24</a></span> may at least be held doubtful. Co. agrees with Gi. as to <span class="ital"><a href="/jeremiah/10-25.htm" title="Pour out your fury on the heathen that know you not, and on the families that call not on your name: for they have eaten up Jacob, and devoured him, and consumed him, and have made his habitation desolate.">Jeremiah 10:25</a></span>, saying that, though suitable in a Maccabaean Psalm, as he considers Psalms 79 to be (where the <span class="ital">v</span>. is identical with <span class="ital"><a href="/context/jeremiah/10-6.htm" title="For as much as there is none like to you, O LORD; you are great, and your name is great in might....">Jeremiah 10:6-7</a></span>), Jeremiah elsewhere holds the nations to be God’s servants, carrying out His punishments on Jerusalem. On the other hand even Du. admits that <span class="ital"><a href="/context/jeremiah/10-23.htm" title="O LORD, I know that the way of man is not in himself: it is not in man that walks to direct his steps....">Jeremiah 10:23-24</a></span> <span class="ital">may be</span> Jeremiah’s own.

Jeremiah and the people, each is, in a sense, the speaker; but here the prophetic faith seems to run rather in advance of that of his fellow-countrymen. They form, however, a fitting sequel to the charges brought against the people in <a href="/jeremiah/9.htm">Jeremiah 9</a>. The speaker admits that he (either the People of Judah personified, or Jeremiah as a representative of its best portion) fully deserves chastisement for having attempted to go his own way (comp. <a href="/isaiah/57-17.htm">Isaiah 57:17</a>). He has now attained an insight into the truth that man's duty is simply to walk in the path which God has marked out for him. He only asks that Jehovah would chastise him <span class="cmt_word">with judgment</span>, or,, more clearly, <span class="accented">according to what is just</span>. The contrast is between punishment inflicted in anger, the object of which is to cause pain to the criminal, and that inflicted as a duty of justice, and of which the object is the criminal's reformation" (Payne Smith). The fear expressed, however, is not exactly <span class="cmt_word">lest thou bring me to nothing</span>, which is too strong for the Hebrew, but lest <span class="accented">thou make me small</span>.

This announcement stands in connection with <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-25.htm">Jeremiah 9:25</a>, in so far as captivity is the accomplishment of the visitation of Judah threatened in <a href="/jeremiah/9-24.htm">Jeremiah 9:24</a>. That connection is not, however, quite direct; the announcement is led up to by the warning against idolatry of vv. 1-16, inasmuch as it furnishes confirmation of the threat uttered in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-15.htm">Jeremiah 10:15</a>, that the idols shall perish in the day of their visitation, and shows besides how, by its folly in the matter of idolatry, Judah has drawn judgment down on itself. The confession in <a href="/jeremiah/10-21.htm">Jeremiah 10:21</a> : the shepherds are become brutish, points manifestly back to the description in <a href="/jeremiah/10-14.htm">Jeremiah 10:14</a> of the folly of the idolaters, and exhibits the connection of <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-17.htm">Jeremiah 10:17-25</a> with the preceding warning against idolatry. For "gather up," etc., Hitz. translates: gather thy trumpery from the ground; so that the expression would have a contemptuous tone. But the meaning of rubbish cannot be proved to belong to &#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1506;&#1492;; and the mockery that would lie in the phrase is out of place. &#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1506;&#1492;, from Arab. kn&#768;, contrahere, constipare, means that which is put together, packed up, one's bundle. The connection of &#1488;&#1505;&#1507; and &#1502;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; is pregnant: put up thy bundle and carry it forth of the land. As N. G. Schroeder suspected, there is about the expression something of the nature of a current popular phrase, like the German Schnr dein Bndel, pack up, i.e., make ready fore the road. She who sits in the siege. The daughter of Zion is meant, but we must not limit the scope to the population of Jerusalem; as is clear from "inhabitants of the land," <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-18.htm">Jeremiah 10:18</a>, the population of the whole land are comprised in the expression. As to the form &#1497;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1514;&#1497;, see at <a href="/jeremiah/22-23.htm">Jeremiah 22:23</a>. &#1488;&#1505;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497; with dag. lene after the sibilant, as in <a href="/isaiah/47-2.htm">Isaiah 47:2</a>. "I hurl forth" expresses the violent manner of the captivity; cf. <a href="/isaiah/22-17.htm">Isaiah 22:17</a>. "This time;" hitherto hostile invasions ended with plundering and the imposition of a tribute: <a href="/2_kings/14-14.htm">2 Kings 14:14</a>; <a href="/2_kings/16-5.htm">2 Kings 16:5</a>; <a href="/2_kings/18-13.htm">2 Kings 18:13</a>. - And I press them hard, or close them in, &#1500;&#1502;&#1506;&#1503; &#1497;&#1502;&#1510;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;. These words are variously explained, because there is no object expressed, and there may be variety of opinion as to what is the subject. Hitz., Umbr., Ng., take the verb find in the sense of feel, and so the object &#1510;&#1512;&#1492; would easily be supplied from the verb &#1492;&#1510;&#1512;&#1514;&#1497;: so that they may feel it, i.e., I will press them sensibly. But we cannot make sure of this meaning for &#1502;&#1510;&#1488; either from <a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a> or from <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:17</a>, where know (&#1497;&#1491;&#1506;) and &#1502;&#1510;&#1488; are clearly identical conceptions. Still less is Graf entitled to supply as object: that which they seek and are to find, namely, God. His appeal in support of this to passages like <a href="/psalms/32-6.htm">Psalm 32:6</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/4-27.htm">Deuteronomy 4:27</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-29.htm">Deuteronomy 4:29</a>, proves nothing; for in such the object is manifestly suggested by the contest, which is not the case here. A just conclusion is obtained when we consider that &#1492;&#1510;&#1512;&#1514;&#1497; contains a play on &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1510;&#1493;&#1512; in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-17.htm">Jeremiah 10:17</a>, and cannot be understood otherwise than as a hemming in by means of a siege. The aim of the siege is to bring those hemmed in under the power of the besiegers, to get at, reach them, or find them. Hence we must take the enemy as subject to "find," while the object is given in &#1500;&#1492;&#1501;: so that they (the enemy) may find them (the besieged). Thus too Jerome, who translates the disputed verb passively: et tribulabo eos ut inveniantur; while he explains the meaning thus: sic eos obsideri faciam, sicque tribulabo et coangustabo, ut omnes in urbe reperiantur et effugere nequeant malum. Taken thus, the second clause serves to strengthen the first: I will hurl forth the inhabitants of this land into a foreign land, and none shall avoid this fate, for I will so hem them in that none shall be able to escape.<p>This harassment will bring the people to their senses, so that they shall humble themselves under the mighty hand of God. Such feelings the prophet utters at <a href="/jeremiah/10-19.htm">Jeremiah 10:19</a>., in the name of the congregation, as he did in the like passage <a href="/jeremiah/4-19.htm">Jeremiah 4:19</a>. As from the hearts of those who had been touched by their affliction, he exclaims: Woe is me for my breach! i.e., my crushing overthrow. The breach is that sustained by the state in its destruction, see at <a href="/jeremiah/4-6.htm">Jeremiah 4:6</a>. &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1492;, grown sick, i.e., grievous, incurable is the stroke that has fallen upon me. For this word we have in <a href="/jeremiah/15-18.htm">Jeremiah 15:18</a> &#1488;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;, which is explained by "refuseth to be healed." &#1493;&#1488;&#1504;&#1497; introduces an antithesis: but I say, sc. in my heart, i.e., I think. Hitz. gives  &#1488;&#1498; the force of a limitation  equals  nothing further than this, but wrongly; and, taking the perf. &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; as a preterite, makes out the import to be: "in their state of careless security they had taken the matter lightly, saying as it were, If no further calamity than this menace us, we may be well content;" a thought quite foreign to the context. For "this my suffering" can be nothing else than the "hurt" on account of which the speaker laments, or the stroke which he calls dangerous, incurable. &#1488;&#1498; has, besides, frequently the force of positive asseveration: yea, certainly (cf. Ew. 354, a), a force readily derived from that of only, nothing else than. And so here: only this, i.e., even this is my suffering. &#1495;&#1500;&#1497;, sickness, here suffering in general, as in <a href="/hosea/5-13.htm">Hosea 5:13</a>; <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>., etc. The old translators took the Yod as pronoun (my suffering), whence it would be necessary to point &#1495;&#1500;&#1497;, like &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;, <a href="/zephaniah/2-9.htm">Zephaniah 2:9</a>; cf. Ew. 293, b, Rem. - The suffering which the congregation must bear consists in the spoliation of the land and the captivity of the people, represented in <a href="/jeremiah/10-20.htm">Jeremiah 10:20</a> under the figure of a destruction of their tent and the disappearance of their sons. The Chald. has fairly paraphrased the verse thus: my land is laid waste and all my cities are plundered, my people has gone off (into exile) and is no longer here. &#1497;&#1510;&#1488;&#1504;&#1497; construed with the accus. like egredi urbem; cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/54-4.htm">Genesis 54:4</a>, etc. - From "my sons have forsaken me" Ng. draws the inference that <a href="/jeremiah/10-19.htm">Jeremiah 10:19</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/10-20.htm">Jeremiah 10:20</a> are the words of the country personified, since neither the prophet could so speak, nor the people, the latter being indeed identical with the sons, and so not forsaken, but forsaking. This inference rests on a mistaken view of the figure of the daughter of Zion, in which is involved the conception of the inhabitants of a land as the children of the land when personified as mother. Nor is there any evidence that the land is speaking in the words: I think, This is my suffering, etc. It is besides alleged that the words give no expression to any sense of guilt; they are said, on the contrary, to give utterance to a consolation which only an innocent land draws from the fact that a calamity is laid upon it, a calamity which must straightway be borne. This is neither true in point of fact, nor does it prove the case. The words, This is my suffering, etc., indicate resignation to the inevitable, not innocence or undeserved suffering. Hereon Graf remarks: "The suffering was unmerited, in so far as the prophet and the godly amongst the people were concerned; but it was inevitable that he and they should take it upon their shoulders, along with the rest." Asserted with so great width, this statement cannot be admitted. The present generation bears the punishment not only for the sins of many past generations, but for its own sins; nor were the godly themselves free from sin and guilt, for they acknowledge the justice of God's chastisement, and pray God to chasten them &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;, not in anger (<a href="/jeremiah/10-24.htm">Jeremiah 10:24</a>). Besides, we cannot take the words as spoken by the prophet or by the godly as opposed to the ungodly, since it is the sons of the speaker ("my sons") that are carried captive, who can certainly not be the sons of the godly alone.</body></html>
