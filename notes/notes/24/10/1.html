Let us stand in awe, and not dare provoke God, by giving that glory to another which is due to him alone.

This does not indeed preclude the possibility that the passage is one which the prophet himself addressed at a later date to his brethren in captivity, and in fact it contains certain of his expressions, viz. <span class="ital">vain, vanity</span>, as applied to idols (<span class="ital"><a href="/jeremiah/10-3.htm" title="For the customs of the people are vain: for one cuts a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman, with the ax.">Jeremiah 10:3</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/10-15.htm" title="They are vanity, and the work of errors: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.">Jeremiah 10:15</a></span>), <span class="ital">in the time of their visitation</span> (<span class="ital"><a href="/jeremiah/10-15.htm" title="They are vanity, and the work of errors: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.">Jeremiah 10:15</a></span>). But the style generally is not that of Jeremiah, and resembles that of the second Isaiah (chs. 40–66), so that it may at any rate be attributed to that period. The MT. is an expansion of the original form of the Hebrew. This is shewn both by the superiority in logical sequence exhibited on the whole (but see on <span class="ital"><a href="/jeremiah/10-10.htm" title="But the LORD is the true God, he is the living God, and an everlasting king: at his wrath the earth shall tremble, and the nations shall not be able to abide his indignation.">Jeremiah 10:10</a></span>) by the text of the LXX in the way of omission as well as change of order (see on <span class="ital"><a href="/context/jeremiah/10-5.htm" title="They are upright as the palm tree, but speak not: they must needs be borne, because they cannot go. Be not afraid of them; for they cannot do evil, neither also is it in them to do good....">Jeremiah 10:5-8</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/10-10.htm" title="But the LORD is the true God, he is the living God, and an everlasting king: at his wrath the earth shall tremble, and the nations shall not be able to abide his indignation.">Jeremiah 10:10</a></span>), and by the smoothness of metre which results from the adoption of the Greek form of text. Co. points out that we then have from <span class="ital"><a href="/jeremiah/10-2.htm" title="Thus said the LORD, Learn not the way of the heathen, and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the heathen are dismayed at them.">Jeremiah 10:2</a></span> onwards a series of clauses arranged in triplets, presenting a clear and well articulated connexion of thought. So too Gi. (in <span class="ital">Jeremias Metrik</span>) with slight differences in detail. Du. shortens the passage still further. We may add that Baruch, ch. 6 (<span class="ital">The Epistle of Jeremy</span>) is partly an amplification of this passage by one who was very familiar with particulars of the idolatry as practised at Babylon.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The passage may be summarized thus. (i) <span class="ital"><a href="/context/jeremiah/10-1.htm" title="Hear you the word which the LORD speaks to you, O house of Israel:...">Jeremiah 10:1-5</a></span>. Be not led away by heathen beliefs. The phenomena seen in the sky have no element of divinity about them. The gods are nothing beyond the materials put together by workmen. They are speechless, and incapable of movement. They are powerless both for good and for harm. (ii) <span class="ital"><a href="/context/jeremiah/10-6.htm" title="For as much as there is none like to you, O LORD; you are great, and your name is great in might....">Jeremiah 10:6-16</a></span>. Jehovah is not as these. He is the supreme God, Creator of the heavens and of the world, and Wielder of the powers of nature. The peoples of the earth may well tremble before Him, who has created all things and has chosen Israel for His own.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The numbers of the dead will be so great, that the bodies will be left lying unburied. The concluding touch to this awful picture is introduced by the formula, "Speak: Thus saith the Lord," as a distinct word from God to banish all doubt of the truth of the statement. This formula is interposed parenthetically, so that the main idea of the clause is joined by &#1493; cop. to <a href="/jeremiah/9-20.htm">Jeremiah 9:20</a>. This &#1493; is not to be deleted as a gloss, as it is by Ew. and others, because it is not found in the lxx.

As a sheaf behind the reaper, which nobody gathers, i.e., which is left to lie unheeded, is not brought by the reaper into the barn. The point of the simile is in the lying unheeded. Strange to say, Graf and Ng. propose to refer the "none gathereth" not to the sheaf of the shearer, but to the dead bodies: whereas the reaper piles the sheaves upon the waggon ad brings them to the threshing-floor, the corpses are left ungathered. </body></html>
