Not that the fear of him among the nations was general, or that he was owned by them as their King; but inasmuch as of right he was their King, so he ought to have been feared and reverenced by them; and it was an instance of great stupidity and ingratitude not to do it. The Targum renders it, <p>"King of all people;'' <p>and the Syriac version, "King of all worlds"; some reference seems to be had to this passage in <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/15-3.htm">Revelation 15:3</a>, where, instead of "King of nations", the Lord is called "King of saints"; and there refers to a time when he will be feared, that is, worshipped and served by all nations, as he ought to be: <p>for to thee doth it appertain; that is, fear belongs to him, it is his due; and this, with keeping the commandments of God, is the whole duty of man. The Vulgate Latin version is, "thine is the glory"; honour or praise, as the Syriac version; and so Jarchi interprets it of beauty or glory; but the Targum, <p>"thine is the kingdom;'' <p>and so Kimchi; and to which agrees the Arabic version. <p>Forasmuch as among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, there is none like unto thee; that is, among all the wise kings of the nations, and all their wise counsellors, there is none like unto God for wisdom, or for glory and majesty; there is none of them that has such a kingdom as he has, or that governs it as he does; and as all their power and government, so all that wisdom by which they manage their political affairs, are from him. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/10.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Who would not fear thee, O King of nations? for to thee doth it appertain: forasmuch as among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, there is none like unto thee.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/10.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">7</span>. <span class="ital">to thee doth it appertain</span>] rather, as mg. <span class="ital">it beseemeth thee</span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">O King of nations</span>. As time went on, the sacred writers became more and more distinct in their assertions of the truth that Jehovah, the Self-revealing God, is not Israel's King only, but also of the world (comp. <a href="/psalms/22-28.htm">Psalm 22:28</a>; <a href="/psalms/47-7.htm">Psalm 47:7, 8</a>; <a href="/psalms/96-10.htm">Psalm 96:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To thee doth it appertain</span>; viz. that men should fear thee.

"Hear the word which Jahveh speaketh unto you, house of Israel! <a href="/jeremiah/10-2.htm">Jeremiah 10:2</a>. Thus saith Jahveh: To the ways of the heathen use yourselves not, and at the signs of the heaven be not dismayed, because the heathen are dismayed at them. <a href="/jeremiah/10-3.htm">Jeremiah 10:3</a>. For the ordinances of the peoples are vain. For it is wood, which one hath cut out of the forest, a work of the craftsman's hands with the axe. <a href="/jeremiah/10-4.htm">Jeremiah 10:4</a>.

As a lathe-wrought pillar are they, and speak not; they are borne, because they cannot walk. Be not afraid of them; for they do not hurt, neither is it in them to do good."<p>This is addressed to the house of Israel, i.e., to the whole covenant people; and "house of Israel" points back to "all the house of Israel" in <a href="/jeremiah/9-25.htm">Jeremiah 9:25</a>. &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501; for &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501;, as frequently in Jeremiah. The way of the heathen is their mode of life, especially their way of worshipping their gods; cf. &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3bf;&#788;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2;, <a href="/acts/9-2.htm">Acts 9:2</a>; <a href="/acts/19-9.htm">Acts 19:9</a>. &#1500;&#1502;&#1491; c. &#1488;&#1500;, accustom oneself to a thing, used in <a href="/jeremiah/13-21.htm">Jeremiah 13:21</a> with the synonymous &#1506;&#1500;, and in <a href="/psalms/18-35.htm">Psalm 18:35</a> (Piel) with &#1500;. The signs of heaven are unwonted phenomena in the heavens, eclipses of the sun and moon, comets, and unusual conjunctions of the stars, which were regarded as the precursors of extraordinary and disastrous events. We cannot admit Hitz.'s objection, that these signs in heaven were sent by Jahveh (<a href="//biblehub.com/joel/3-3.htm">Joel 3:3-4</a>), and that before these, as heralds of judgment, not only the heathen, but the Jews themselves, had good cause to be dismayed. For the signs that marked the dawning of the day of the Lord are not merely such things as eclipses of sun and moon, and the like. There is still less ground for Ng.'s idea, that the signs of heaven are such as, being permanently there, call forth religious adoration from year to year, the primitive constellations (<a href="/job/9-9.htm">Job 9:9</a>), the twelve signs of the zodiac; for &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;( &#1504;&#1495;&#1514;), to be in fear, consternari, never means, even in <a href="//biblehub.com/malachi/2-5.htm">Malachi 2:5</a>, regular or permanent adoration. "For the heathen," etc., gives the cause of the fear: the heathen are dismayed before these, because in the stars they adored supernatural powers.</body></html>
