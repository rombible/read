Their founder was the Jonadab, or Jehonadab, who appears as the ally of Jehu in the overthrow of the house of Ahab (<a href="/2_kings/10-15.htm" title="And when he was departed there, he lighted on Jehonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him: and he saluted him, and said to him, Is your heart right, as my heart is with your heart? And Jehonadab answered, It is. If it be, give me your hand. And he gave him his hand; and he took him up to him into the chariot.">2Kings 10:15</a>). It is clear from that history that he exercised an influence over the people which Jehu was glad to secure, and that he welcomed “the zeal for the Lord” which led Jehu to the massacre of the worshippers of Baal. He is described as the “son of Rechab,” but seeing that that name, which means “chariot,” was applied to the great Tishbite prophet, as in “the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof” (<a href="/2_kings/2-12.htm" title="And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof. And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces.">2Kings 2:12</a>), it has been thought, with some probability, that the name “son of Rechab” means “Son of the chariot” (so in later Jewish history we have Bar-cochba = son of the star), <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> “disciple of the great prophet.” Anyhow, the life which Jonadab enforced on his followers presented all the characteristic features of that of Elijah. It was a protest against the Baal-worship that had flowed into Israel from Phoenicia, against the corruption of the life of cities, against the intemperance which was tainting the life of Israel (<a href="/context/amos/6-4.htm" title="That lie on beds of ivory, and stretch themselves on their couches, and eat the lambs out of the flock, and the calves out of the middle of the stall;">Amos 6:4-6</a>).

For that this latter was a man of considerable eminence is manifest from the respect shown him by Jehu; and his being taken along with that prince to witness his zeal for the honour of the true God, shows him to have been a man of right and religious principles. The institutions he left with his posterity bespeak a principal concern for the purity of their morals, which he might rightly suppose would be less liable to be corrupted whilst they adhered to the simplicity of their ancient usages, than if they adopted the refinements of modern luxury. He, therefore, enjoined them not only to abstain from the use of wine, but to live as the patriarchs did of old, and as many of their countrymen, the Scenite Arabs, continue to do at this day, without any fixed habitations or possessions, far from the society of cities, in the open country, feeding their flocks, and maintaining themselves by the produce of them.” — Blaney. <span class="ital">And bring them into the house of the Lord</span> — Into one of the chambers adjoining to the temple.

He lived nearly 300 years before, 2Ki 10:15. Jonadab charged his posterity not to drink wine. He also appointed them to dwell in tents, or movable dwelling: this would teach them not to think of settling any where in this world. To keep low, would be the way to continue long in the land where they were strangers. Humility and contentment are always the best policy, and men's surest protection. Also, that they might not run into unlawful pleasures, they were to deny themselves even lawful delights. The consideration that we are strangers and pilgrims should oblige us to abstain from all fleshly lusts. Let them have little to lose, and then losing times would be the less dreadful: let them sit loose to what they had, and then they might with less pain be stript of it. Those are in the best frame to meet sufferings who live a life of self-denial, and who despise the vanities of the world. Jonadab's posterity observed these rules strictly, only using proper means for their safety in a time of general suffering.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/35.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The house - The family.<p>The Rechabites - The Rechabites were a nomadic tribe not of Jewish but of Kenite race, and connected with the Amalekites <a href="/numbers/24-21.htm">Numbers 24:21</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-6.htm">1 Samuel 15:6</a>, from whom however they had separated themselves, and made a close alliance with the tribe of Judah <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/1-16.htm">Judges 1:16</a>, on whose southern borders they took up their dwelling <a href="/1_samuel/27-10.htm">1 Samuel 27:10</a>.

They came into Canaan with the Israelites, but, in order to preserve their independence, chose a life in tents without a fixed habitation (1Sa 15:6). Besides the branch of them associated with Judah and extending to Amalek, there was another section at Kadesh, in Naphtali (Jud 4:11, 17). They seem to have been proselytes of the gate, Jonadab, son of Rechab, whose charge not to drink wine they so strictly obeyed, was zealous for God (2Ki 10:15-23).

From a notice in <a href="/1_chronicles/2-55.htm">1 Chronicles 2:55</a> it appears that the Rechabites were a subdivision of the Kenites, the nomad tribe so closely connected with the Israelites (<a href="/judges/1-16.htm">Judges 1:16</a>; <a href="/judges/4-18.htm">Judges 4:18-22</a>; comp. <a href="/numbers/10-29.htm">Numbers 10:29</a>), especially with the tribe of Judah (<a href="/1_samuel/27-10.htm">1 Samuel 27:10</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/30-29.htm">1 Samuel 30:29</a>).

There seem, in fact, to have been two branches of the Kenites - one having Edomitish, the other Israelitish, affinities. Records of the former still exist in the Sinaitic inscriptions, and in the Arabian histories; indeed, there is still a tribe called Benu-l-Qain (often contracted into Belqein) in the Belqa (the ancient land of Ammon); and it would seem that there is an Arab tribe in Arabia Petraea, eastward of Kerak, which traces itself to Heber the Kenite. and goes by the name of Yehud Chebr, though it now denies any connection with Jews. There were also Jews of Khaibar, near Mecca, who played an important part in the early history of Islam (see further 'Zeitschr. der deutschen morgenland.

Because ye have not hearkened, by proclaiming, every one, liberty to his bondman (this certainly had been done, but was again undone by annulling the decree), therefore I proclaim liberty for you; i.e., you, who have hitherto been my servants (<a href="/leviticus/25-55.htm">Leviticus 25:55</a>), I discharge from this relation, - deliver you up to your fate as regards the sword, etc., that the sword, famine, and pestilence may have power over you. For &#1500;&#1494;&#1493;&#1506;&#1492; see <a href="/jeremiah/15-4.htm">Jeremiah 15:4</a>. - In <a href="/jeremiah/34-18.htm">Jeremiah 34:18</a> the construction is disputed. Many, including Luther, take &#1492;&#1506;&#1490;&#1500; as the second object to &#1504;&#1514;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;: "I will make the men...the calf," i.e., like the calf. But, though &#1504;&#1514;&#1503; is frequently construed with a double accusative with the meaning of making some thing another thing (cf. e.g., <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-22.htm">Jeremiah 34:22</a>, <a href="/genesis/17-5.htm">Genesis 17:5</a>; <a href="/exodus/7-1.htm">Exodus 7:1</a>), yet in such a case the predicative-object does not readily take the article. Moreover, &#1504;&#1514;&#1503;, in the sense required here, to make like  equals  treat as, is joined with &#1499;&#1468;, as in <a href="/isaiah/41-2.htm">Isaiah 41:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-2.htm">Ezekiel 28:2</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/28-6.htm">Ezekiel 28:6</a>; <a href="/genesis/42-30.htm">Genesis 42:30</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/10-27.htm">1 Kings 10:27</a>, etc. Finally, Rosenmller objects: continuata versu 19 personarum descriptio et repetitio verbi yt&#803;itanfw&#817; <a href="/jeremiah/34-20.htm">Jeremiah 34:20</a> vix permittunt, propositionem hoc versu absolvi. For these reasons, L. de Dieu, Rosenmller, Ewald, and Graf have taken &#1492;&#1506;&#1490;&#1500; as being in apposition to &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514;, and the enumeration "princes of Judah," etc., <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-19.htm">Jeremiah 34:19</a>, as a continuation or exposition of &#1492;&#1488;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-18.htm">Jeremiah 34:18</a>, and &#1493;&#1504;&#1514;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; &#1488;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501;, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-20.htm">Jeremiah 34:20</a>, as a resumption of the same words in <a href="/jeremiah/34-18.htm">Jeremiah 34:18</a>. According to this view, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-18.htm">Jeremiah 34:18-20</a> would form a series of appositions: "I will give the men...that have not kept the words of the covenant which they concluded before me...the princes of Judah who passed between the parts of the calf, - these will I give into the hands of their enemies." But, apart from the consideration that the enumeration of the covenant-breakers (viz., the princes of Judah, etc.), which is added by way of apposition in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-19.htm">Jeremiah 34:19</a>, ought not to come in till after the apposition to &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514;, which would be a harsh and complicated arrangement of the members of the sentence, this construction seems untenable for the following reasons: (a) "The calf that they cut," etc., which forms the explanatory apposition to "the covenant," is separated from it by the intervening clause, "which they made before me." And (b), even though we might modify this harshness by repeating &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497; before &#1492;&#1506;&#1490;&#1500;, yet the mode of expression, "they have not performed the words of the calf which they cut in two, and between whose parts they passed," would be a very stiff and unnatural one for "they have not performed what they vowed or sware in presence of the parts of the calf which they had halved, and when they passed through between these pieces." With Maurer and Hitzig, therefore, we abide by the older view, which takes &#1492;&#1506;&#1490;&#1500; as the second object to &#1493;&#1504;&#1514;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;: "I will make the men...the calf," or, better, "like the calf which they cut in two," etc. The article is used with &#1506;&#1490;&#1500; because this predicate is more exactly determined by relative clauses, and &#1492;&#1506;&#1490;&#1500; stands for &#1499;&#1468;&#1506;&#1490;&#1500;, since, as often happens, the &#1499;&#1468; of likeness is dropped to give more point to the idea. We make <a href="/jeremiah/34-19.htm">Jeremiah 34:19</a> begin a new sentence, and take the names of this verse as objects absolute, which, by &#1488;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501; following &#1493;&#1504;&#1514;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, are subordinated to the verb: "As for the princes of Judah...them shall I give...." - From <a href="/jeremiah/34-18.htm">Jeremiah 34:18</a> we see that, when alliances were entered into, the contracting parties slaughtered an &#1506;&#1490;&#1500;, "calf," i.e., a young bullock, cut it in two halves, and went through between the pieces that were placed opposite one another. See on <a href="/genesis/15-10.htm">Genesis 15:10</a> for details regarding this most ancient custom and its meaning: according to the account of Ephraem Syrus, it is of Chaldean origin. Thus are explained the phrases used to signify the making of a covenant. &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514; &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514;, to cut a covenant, &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3b1; &#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, faedus ferire, i.e., ferienda hostia faedus facere. We cannot with certainty infer, from the threatening pronounced in this passage, that this rite originally signified nothing more than that he who broke his promise would be treated like the animal that had been slaughtered. For the threatening is merely a conclusion drawn from the sacred act; but this does not exclude a deeper meaning of the rite.</body></html>
