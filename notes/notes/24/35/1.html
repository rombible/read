Jerusalem was not yet besieged. Jehoiakim had not filled up the measure of his iniquities. The armies of the Chaldæans were, however, in the meantime moving on the outskirts of the kingdom of Judah (<a href="/jeremiah/35-11.htm" title="But it came to pass, when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came up into the land, that we said, Come, and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans, and for fear of the army of the Syrians: so we dwell at Jerusalem.">Jeremiah 35:11</a>) or were driving the nomad inhabitants, who had hitherto dwelt in tents, to take refuge in the cities.

This may most probably be referred to the fourth year of Jehoaikim’s reign, when Nebuchadnezzar, having beaten the king of Egypt’s army at Euphrates, (see <a href="/jeremiah/46-2.htm" title="Against Egypt, against the army of Pharaohnecho king of Egypt, which was by the river Euphrates in Carchemish, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon smote in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah.">Jeremiah 46:2</a>,) marched toward Syria and Palestine, to recover those provinces again which the king of Egypt had conquered, in which expedition he laid siege to Jerusalem.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/35.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>35:1-11 Jonadab was famous for wisdom and piety. He lived nearly 300 years before, 2Ki 10:15. Jonadab charged his posterity not to drink wine. He also appointed them to dwell in tents, or movable dwelling: this would teach them not to think of settling any where in this world. To keep low, would be the way to continue long in the land where they were strangers. Humility and contentment are always the best policy, and men's surest protection. Also, that they might not run into unlawful pleasures, they were to deny themselves even lawful delights. The consideration that we are strangers and pilgrims should oblige us to abstain from all fleshly lusts. Let them have little to lose, and then losing times would be the less dreadful: let them sit loose to what they had, and then they might with less pain be stript of it. Those are in the best frame to meet sufferings who live a life of self-denial, and who despise the vanities of the world. Jonadab's posterity observed these rules strictly, only using proper means for their safety in a time of general suffering.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/34.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Which are gone up from you - i. e., which have departed for the present, and have raised the siege. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/35.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 35<p>Jer 35:1-19.

The Holy Spirit has arranged Jeremiah's prophecies by the moral rather than the chronological connection.

Because ye have not hearkened, by proclaiming, every one, liberty to his bondman (this certainly had been done, but was again undone by annulling the decree), therefore I proclaim liberty for you; i.e., you, who have hitherto been my servants (<a href="/leviticus/25-55.htm">Leviticus 25:55</a>), I discharge from this relation, - deliver you up to your fate as regards the sword, etc., that the sword, famine, and pestilence may have power over you. For &#1500;&#1494;&#1493;&#1506;&#1492; see <a href="/jeremiah/15-4.htm">Jeremiah 15:4</a>. - In <a href="/jeremiah/34-18.htm">Jeremiah 34:18</a> the construction is disputed. Many, including Luther, take &#1492;&#1506;&#1490;&#1500; as the second object to &#1504;&#1514;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;: "I will make the men...the calf," i.e., like the calf. But, though &#1504;&#1514;&#1503; is frequently construed with a double accusative with the meaning of making some thing another thing (cf. e.g., <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-22.htm">Jeremiah 34:22</a>, <a href="/genesis/17-5.htm">Genesis 17:5</a>; <a href="/exodus/7-1.htm">Exodus 7:1</a>), yet in such a case the predicative-object does not readily take the article. Moreover, &#1504;&#1514;&#1503;, in the sense required here, to make like  equals  treat as, is joined with &#1499;&#1468;, as in <a href="/isaiah/41-2.htm">Isaiah 41:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-2.htm">Ezekiel 28:2</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/28-6.htm">Ezekiel 28:6</a>; <a href="/genesis/42-30.htm">Genesis 42:30</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/10-27.htm">1 Kings 10:27</a>, etc. Finally, Rosenmller objects: continuata versu 19 personarum descriptio et repetitio verbi yt&#803;itanfw&#817; <a href="/jeremiah/34-20.htm">Jeremiah 34:20</a> vix permittunt, propositionem hoc versu absolvi. For these reasons, L. de Dieu, Rosenmller, Ewald, and Graf have taken &#1492;&#1506;&#1490;&#1500; as being in apposition to &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514;, and the enumeration "princes of Judah," etc., <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-19.htm">Jeremiah 34:19</a>, as a continuation or exposition of &#1492;&#1488;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-18.htm">Jeremiah 34:18</a>, and &#1493;&#1504;&#1514;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; &#1488;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501;, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-20.htm">Jeremiah 34:20</a>, as a resumption of the same words in <a href="/jeremiah/34-18.htm">Jeremiah 34:18</a>. According to this view, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-18.htm">Jeremiah 34:18-20</a> would form a series of appositions: "I will give the men...that have not kept the words of the covenant which they concluded before me...the princes of Judah who passed between the parts of the calf, - these will I give into the hands of their enemies." But, apart from the consideration that the enumeration of the covenant-breakers (viz., the princes of Judah, etc.), which is added by way of apposition in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-19.htm">Jeremiah 34:19</a>, ought not to come in till after the apposition to &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514;, which would be a harsh and complicated arrangement of the members of the sentence, this construction seems untenable for the following reasons: (a) "The calf that they cut," etc., which forms the explanatory apposition to "the covenant," is separated from it by the intervening clause, "which they made before me." And (b), even though we might modify this harshness by repeating &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497; before &#1492;&#1506;&#1490;&#1500;, yet the mode of expression, "they have not performed the words of the calf which they cut in two, and between whose parts they passed," would be a very stiff and unnatural one for "they have not performed what they vowed or sware in presence of the parts of the calf which they had halved, and when they passed through between these pieces." With Maurer and Hitzig, therefore, we abide by the older view, which takes &#1492;&#1506;&#1490;&#1500; as the second object to &#1493;&#1504;&#1514;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;: "I will make the men...the calf," or, better, "like the calf which they cut in two," etc. The article is used with &#1506;&#1490;&#1500; because this predicate is more exactly determined by relative clauses, and &#1492;&#1506;&#1490;&#1500; stands for &#1499;&#1468;&#1506;&#1490;&#1500;, since, as often happens, the &#1499;&#1468; of likeness is dropped to give more point to the idea. We make <a href="/jeremiah/34-19.htm">Jeremiah 34:19</a> begin a new sentence, and take the names of this verse as objects absolute, which, by &#1488;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501; following &#1493;&#1504;&#1514;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, are subordinated to the verb: "As for the princes of Judah...them shall I give...." - From <a href="/jeremiah/34-18.htm">Jeremiah 34:18</a> we see that, when alliances were entered into, the contracting parties slaughtered an &#1506;&#1490;&#1500;, "calf," i.e., a young bullock, cut it in two halves, and went through between the pieces that were placed opposite one another. See on <a href="/genesis/15-10.htm">Genesis 15:10</a> for details regarding this most ancient custom and its meaning: according to the account of Ephraem Syrus, it is of Chaldean origin. Thus are explained the phrases used to signify the making of a covenant. &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514; &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514;, to cut a covenant, &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3b1; &#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, faedus ferire, i.e., ferienda hostia faedus facere. We cannot with certainty infer, from the threatening pronounced in this passage, that this rite originally signified nothing more than that he who broke his promise would be treated like the animal that had been slaughtered. For the threatening is merely a conclusion drawn from the sacred act; but this does not exclude a deeper meaning of the rite.</body></html>
