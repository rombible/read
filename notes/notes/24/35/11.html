He lived nearly 300 years before, 2Ki 10:15. Jonadab charged his posterity not to drink wine. He also appointed them to dwell in tents, or movable dwelling: this would teach them not to think of settling any where in this world. To keep low, would be the way to continue long in the land where they were strangers. Humility and contentment are always the best policy, and men's surest protection. Also, that they might not run into unlawful pleasures, they were to deny themselves even lawful delights. The consideration that we are strangers and pilgrims should oblige us to abstain from all fleshly lusts. Let them have little to lose, and then losing times would be the less dreadful: let them sit loose to what they had, and then they might with less pain be stript of it. Those are in the best frame to meet sufferings who live a life of self-denial, and who despise the vanities of the world. Jonadab's posterity observed these rules strictly, only using proper means for their safety in a time of general suffering.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/35.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Syrians - The Septuagint substitutes Assyrians for Syrians, but marauding bands of the Aramaeans are probably meant. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/35.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11.

It seems as though this was quickly after Nebuchadnezzar's incursion, and when he was but just departed; so that their fears had not wholly subsided; and they, as yet, had not returned to their tents, and former manner of living: hence it appears that the Rechabites did not look upon this command of their father as equal to a divine precept, which must be always obeyed; but that in case of necessity it might be dispensed with, and especially when in danger of life, and when human prudence required it; and in which case the lawgiver himself would have dispensed with it, had he been on the spot. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/35.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But it came to pass, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up into the land, that we said, Come, and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans, and for fear of the army of the Syrians: so we <span class="cverse3">{h}</span> dwell at Jerusalem.</span><p>(h) Which declares that they were not so bound to their vow that it could not be broken for any need, for where they were commanded to dwell in tents, they dwell now at Jerusalem for fear of the wars.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/35.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">11</span>. <span class="ital">Syrians</span>] allies of the Chaldaeans at this period.

But they explained that they did not drink wine, because their father, i.e., their ancestor, Jonadab had forbidden them and their posterity to drink wine for ever, as also to build houses, to sow seed, and to plant vineyards, i.e., to settle themselves down in permanent dwellings and to pursue agriculture. &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492; &#1500;&#1499;&#1501;, "And there shall not be to you," sc. what has just been named, i.e., ye must not possess houses, growing-crops, or vineyards (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/35-9.htm">Jeremiah 35:9</a>),<p>(Note: These injunctions, given by Jonadab to his posterity, that he might make them always lead a nomad life, are quoted by Diodorus Siculus, xix. 94, as a law among the Nabateans: &#x39d;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b5; &#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b5; &#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b5; &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#837; &#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b5; &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;; while the object of the law is stated to have been the maintenance of their freedom against the more powerful who sought to bring them into subjection.

Arvieux, Sitten der Beduinen-Araber, 5f.)<p>but ye are to dwell in tents all your life, that ye may live long, etc. This promise is an imitation of that found in <a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>.</body></html>
