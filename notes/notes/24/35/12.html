Thus the Rechabites’ observance of their father’s charge to them is made use of by God as an aggravation of the disobedience of the Jews to him: and the aggravation was certainly very high. For, 1st, The Rechabites were obedient to one that was but a man like themselves, and had only the wisdom and power of a man, and was only the father of their flesh; but the Jews were disobedient to the infinite and eternal God, that had an absolute authority over them, as <span class="ital">the father of their spirits. </span>2d, Jonadab was long since dead, and was ignorant of his posterity, and could neither take cognizance of their disobedience to his orders, nor give any correction for it; but God lives for ever to see how his laws are observed, and is in readiness to punish all disobedience. 3d, The Rechabites were probably seldom or never put in mind of their obligations to their progenitor; but God often sent his prophets to his people, to remind them of, and excite to, their duty to him, yet they would not comply with it. This is insisted on here as a great aggravation of their disobedience, <a href="/jeremiah/35-14.htm" title="The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, that he commanded his sons not to drink wine, are performed; for to this day they drink none, but obey their father's commandment: notwithstanding I have spoken to you, rising early and speaking; but you listened not to me.">Jeremiah 35:14</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/15-4.htm" title="And I will cause them to be removed into all kingdoms of the earth, because of Manasseh the son of Hezekiah king of Judah, for that which he did in Jerusalem.">Jeremiah 15:4</a> th, Jonadab had not conferred, nor could confer, any such favours on his seed as God had bestowed on his people, nor had laid them under any such obligations, from duty and interest, to obey him, as God had laid Israel and Judah under to observe his laws. 5th, God did not oblige his people to so much hardship, and to such instances of self-denial and mortification, as Jonadab enjoined to his seed, and yet Jonadab’s orders, were obeyed, and God’s were not.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/35.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>35:12-19 The trial of the Rechabites' constancy was for a sign; it made the disobedience of the Jews to God the more marked. The Rechabites were obedient to one who was but a man like themselves, and Jonadab never did for his seed what God has done for his people. Mercy is promised to the Rechabites. We are not told respecting the performance of this promise; but doubtless it was performed, and travellers say the Rechabites may be found a separate people to this day.

But they explained that they did not drink wine, because their father, i.e., their ancestor, Jonadab had forbidden them and their posterity to drink wine for ever, as also to build houses, to sow seed, and to plant vineyards, i.e., to settle themselves down in permanent dwellings and to pursue agriculture. &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492; &#1500;&#1499;&#1501;, "And there shall not be to you," sc. what has just been named, i.e., ye must not possess houses, growing-crops, or vineyards (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/35-9.htm">Jeremiah 35:9</a>),<p>(Note: These injunctions, given by Jonadab to his posterity, that he might make them always lead a nomad life, are quoted by Diodorus Siculus, xix. 94, as a law among the Nabateans: &#x39d;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b5; &#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b5; &#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b5; &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#837; &#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b5; &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;; while the object of the law is stated to have been the maintenance of their freedom against the more powerful who sought to bring them into subjection.
