Like Samson (<a href="/context/judges/13-4.htm" title="Now therefore beware, I pray you, and drink not wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing:">Judges 13:4-5</a>), Samuel (inferentially from <a href="/1_samuel/1-11.htm" title="And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if you will indeed look on the affliction of your handmaid, and remember me, and not forget your handmaid, but will give to your handmaid a man child, then I will give him to the LORD all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come on his head.">1Samuel 1:11</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/1-15.htm" title="And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before the LORD.">1Samuel 1:15</a>), and the Baptist (<a href="/luke/1-15.htm" title="For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother's womb.">Luke 1:15</a>), they were life-long Nazarites (<a href="/context/numbers/6-1.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,">Numbers 6:1-6</a>). Jonadab’s intention was obviously to keep them as a separate people, retaining their nomadic form of life, free from the contamination of cities, or the temptations of acquired property, or the risks of attack which such property brought with it. They are now invited, and it must have seemed to them a strange invitation to come from a prophet’s lips, to break that rule, and they answer almost in the tone of a calm but indignant protest. They have been faithful hitherto, and they will continue faithful still. In the words “that your days may be long in the land” we may, perhaps, trace an echo of the fifth commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-12.htm" title="Honor your father and your mother: that your days may be long on the land which the LORD your God gives you.">Exodus 20:12</a>), viewed as extending to the relations which connect the members of an order with its head. The rule has descended to the followers of Islam, and the law of abstinence has been extended by Abdul-Wahab to tobacco. Diodoras Siculus (xix. 94) relates that the Nabathæans adopted the Rechabite rule in its completeness. Possibly they were Rechabites.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/35.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>35:1-11 Jonadab was famous for wisdom and piety. He lived nearly 300 years before, 2Ki 10:15. Jonadab charged his posterity not to drink wine. He also appointed them to dwell in tents, or movable dwelling: this would teach them not to think of settling any where in this world. To keep low, would be the way to continue long in the land where they were strangers. Humility and contentment are always the best policy, and men's surest protection. Also, that they might not run into unlawful pleasures, they were to deny themselves even lawful delights. The consideration that we are strangers and pilgrims should oblige us to abstain from all fleshly lusts. Let them have little to lose, and then losing times would be the less dreadful: let them sit loose to what they had, and then they might with less pain be stript of it. Those are in the best frame to meet sufferings who live a life of self-denial, and who despise the vanities of the world. Jonadab's posterity observed these rules strictly, only using proper means for their safety in a time of general suffering.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/35.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Wine is the symbol of a settled life, because the vine requires time for its growth and care in its cultivation, while the preparation of the wine itself requires buildings, and it then has to be stored up before it is ready for use.

Jonadab &#8230; our father&#8212;that is, forefather and director, three hundred years before (2Ki 10:15). They were called Rechabites, not Jonadabites, having received their name from Rechab the father, previously to their adopting the injunctions of Jonadab his son. This case affords no justification for slavish deference to the religious opinions of the Christian fathers: for Jonadab's injunction only affected matters of the present life; moreover, it was not binding on their consciences, for they deemed it not unlawful to go to Jerusalem in the invasion (Jer 35:11). What is praised here is not the father's injunction, but the obedience of the sons [Calvin].<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/35.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> It is uncertain whether <span class="ital">father</span> here signifies their immediate parent, or (which is more probable) their progenitor; it is most likely it referreth to that Jonadab of whom we read <span class="bld"><a href="/2_kings/10-15.htm" title="And when he was departed there, he lighted on Jehonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him: and he saluted him, and said to him, Is your heart right, as my heart is with your heart?

And he gave him his hand; and he took him up to him into the chariot.">2 Kings 10:15</a></span>, who was the father (that is, the progenitor) of this family of the Rechabites, at three hundred years distance. The reason why he left his posterity this charge is uncertain, probably to warn them against the luxury which he saw began to abound in Israel, and being desirous that they should inure themselves to a more hard and laborious life; being originally Kenites, and used to husbandry, and keeping of sheep and other cattle, he desired they should live according to their quality. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/35.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But they said, we will drink no wine,....

What was the reason of this command, and of what follows, is not easy to say; whether it was to prevent quarrels and contentions, luxury and sensuality; or to inure them to hardships; or to put them in remembrance that they were but strangers in the land in which they lived; or to retain them in the original course of life their ancestors had lived in, feeding cattle; be it what it will, these his sons thought themselves under obligations to observe it; and perhaps finding, by experience, it was for their good so to do. <p>(e)   "non hibimus vinum", Vatablus, Schmidt.

This illustrates the uncompromising zeal of Jonadab in <a href="/2_kings/10-23.htm">2 Kings 10:23</a>; the religion of Baal was probably at the opposite pole in the matter of luxury to that of Jehovah as practised by Jonadab. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Not for you the life<br />Of sloth and ease within the city's gates,<br />Where idol feasts are held, and incense smokes<br />To Baalim and Ashtaroth; where man<br />Loses his manhood, and the scoffers sit<br />Perverting judgment, selfish, soft, impure."</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">Plumptre.</span>) <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall drink no wine,</span> etc. The Rechabites were, in fact, typical Arabs. The Wahhabee movement, in our own century, may be taken as partly parallel, though, of course, a settled life is not one of the abominations of the neo-orthodox Islam. A still more complete parallel is given by Diodorus Siculus (19:94), who states it to be the law of the Nabataeans, "neither to sow corn, nor to plant any fruit-bearing herb, nor to drink wine, nor to prepare houses," and gives as the motive of this the preservation of their independence. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/34.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div><a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-19.htm">Jeremiah 34:19-22</a> give the real explanation of the threatening attached to the ritual of the covenant.
