The Rechabites were obedient to one who was but a man like themselves, and Jonadab never did for his seed what God has done for his people. Mercy is promised to the Rechabites. We are not told respecting the performance of this promise; but doubtless it was performed, and travellers say the Rechabites may be found a separate people to this day.

But they explained that they did not drink wine, because their father, i.e., their ancestor, Jonadab had forbidden them and their posterity to drink wine for ever, as also to build houses, to sow seed, and to plant vineyards, i.e., to settle themselves down in permanent dwellings and to pursue agriculture. &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492; &#1500;&#1499;&#1501;, "And there shall not be to you," sc. what has just been named, i.e., ye must not possess houses, growing-crops, or vineyards (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/35-9.htm">Jeremiah 35:9</a>),<p>(Note: These injunctions, given by Jonadab to his posterity, that he might make them always lead a nomad life, are quoted by Diodorus Siculus, xix. 94, as a law among the Nabateans: &#x39d;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b5; &#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b5; &#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b5; &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#837; &#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b5; &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;; while the object of the law is stated to have been the maintenance of their freedom against the more powerful who sought to bring them into subjection.
