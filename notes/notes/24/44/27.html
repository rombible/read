Since they were determined to persist in their idolatry, God would go on to punish them. What little remains of religion were among them, would be lost. The creature-comforts and confidences from which we promise ourselves most, may fail as soon as those from which we promise ourselves least; and all are what God makes them, not what we fancy them to be.

"And Jeremiah spake to all the people, to the men and women, and to all the people that had given him answer, saying, <a href="/jeremiah/44-21.htm">Jeremiah 44:21</a>. Did not the incense-burning which he performed in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, ye and your fathers, your kings and your princes, and the people of the land-did not Jahveh remember them, and did it not arise in His mind? <a href="/jeremiah/44-22.htm">Jeremiah 44:22</a>. And Jahveh could no longer endure it, because of the wickedness of your deeds, because of the abominations which ye committed; thus your land became a desolation, and a waste, and a curse, without an inhabitant, as at this day. <a href="/jeremiah/44-23.htm">Jeremiah 44:23</a>. Because ye burned incense and sinned against Jahveh, and did not hearken to the voice of Jahveh, and in His law, in His statutes, and in His testimonies ye walked not; therefore this evil hath befallen you, as at this day." Jeremiah answers them that their idol-worship, by which they have provoked the Lord their God, is the very cause of the misfortune that has befallen them, because God could no longer endure this abomination which they would not forsake. &#1492;&#1511;&#1468;&#1496;&#1468;&#1512; is a noun, "the burning of incense," which includes, besides, all the other elements of idolatrous worship hence the word is resumed, at the close, under the plur. &#1488;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501;, "these things." &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492; is 3rd pers. sing. neut., lit., "it has come into His mind," i.e., He has carefully considered it, and that in the way of punishment, for He could no longer endure such abomination. The imperf. &#1497;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500; is used for the historic tense (imperf. with &#1493; consec.), because the &#1493; would necessarily be separated from the verb by the &#1500;&#1488;; and it is employed instead of the perfect, which we would be inclined to expect after the preceding &#1494;&#1499;&#1512;, since that which is treated of is something that endures for a considerable time; cf. Ewald, 346, b.
