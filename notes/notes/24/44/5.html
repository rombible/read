It becomes us to warn men of the danger of sin with all seriousness: Oh, do not do it! If you love God, do not, for it is provoking to him; if you love your own souls, do not, for it is destructive to them. Let conscience do this for us in the hour of temptation. The Jews whom God sent into the land of the Chaldeans, were there, by the power of God's grace, weaned from idolatry; but those who went by their own perverse will into the land of the Egyptians, were there more attached than ever to their idolatries. When we thrust ourselves without cause or call into places of temptation, it is just with God to leave us to ourselves. If we walk contrary to God, he will walk contrary to us. The most awful miseries to which men are exposed, are occasioned by the neglect of offered salvation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/44.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Howbeit I sent - And I sent. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/44.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4.

The first person &#1492;&#1510;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, for which lxx, Syriac, and Vulgate have the third, must not be meddled with; it corresponds to &#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; in <a href="/jeremiah/43-10.htm">Jeremiah 43:10</a>. What Nebuchadnezzar does as Jahveh's servant (&#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;, <a href="/jeremiah/43-10.htm">Jeremiah 43:10</a>) is done by God. The suffixes in &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1508;&#1501; and &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1501; are assigned in such a way that the one is to be referred to the temples, the other to the idols; see on <a href="/jeremiah/48-7.htm">Jeremiah 48:7</a>. - &#1493;&#1506;&#1496;&#1492; has been variously interpreted. &#1506;&#1496;&#1492; with the accus. &#1502;&#1506;&#1497;&#1500; or &#1513;&#1474;&#1500;&#1502;&#1492; means the envelope one's self with a garment, put on a garment, wrap the cloak round; cf. <a href="/1_samuel/28-14.htm">1 Samuel 28:14</a>; <a href="/psalms/109-19.htm">Psalm 109:19</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/59-17.htm">Isaiah 59:17</a>, etc. This is the meaning of the verb here, as is shown by the clause expressing the comparison. The point of likeness is the easiness of the action. Ewald has very well explained the meaning of the whole: "As easily as any shepherd in the open field wraps himself in his cloak, so will he take the whole of Egypt in his hand, and be able to throw it round him like a light garment, that he may then, thus dressed as it were with booty, leave the land in peace, without a foe, - a complete victor." Other explanations of the word are far-fetched, and lexically untenable. </body></html>
