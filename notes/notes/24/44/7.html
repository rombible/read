It becomes us to warn men of the danger of sin with all seriousness: Oh, do not do it! If you love God, do not, for it is provoking to him; if you love your own souls, do not, for it is destructive to them. Let conscience do this for us in the hour of temptation. The Jews whom God sent into the land of the Chaldeans, were there, by the power of God's grace, weaned from idolatry; but those who went by their own perverse will into the land of the Egyptians, were there more attached than ever to their idolatries. When we thrust ourselves without cause or call into places of temptation, it is just with God to leave us to ourselves. If we walk contrary to God, he will walk contrary to us.

From this heading we perceive that those who (according to <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-1.htm">Jeremiah 43:1-13</a>) had gone to Egypt, had settled there in various parts of the country, and that the following denunciations, which at the same time form his last prophecy, were uttered a long time after that which is given in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-8.htm">Jeremiah 43:8-13</a> as having been delivered at Tahpanhes. The date of it cannot, indeed, be determined exactly. From the threatening that King Hophra shall be delivered over to the power of Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-24.htm">Jeremiah 44:24-30</a>), only this much is clear, that Egypt was not yet occupied by the Chaldeans, which, as we have shown above (p. 353), did not take place before the year 572. But it by no means follows from this that Jeremiah did not utter these words of threatening till shortly before this event. He may have done so even five or ten years before, in the period between 585 and 580, as we have already observed on p. 12. The Jews had settled down, not merely in the two northern frontier towns, Migdol (i.e., Magdolo, &#x39c;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, according to the Itiner. Anton., twelve Roman miles from Pelusium, Copt. Meschtl, Egypt. Ma'ktr, the most northerly place in Egypt; see on <a href="/ezekiel/29-10.htm">Ezekiel 29:10</a>) and Tahpanhes (i.e., Daphne, see on <a href="/jeremiah/43-7.htm">Jeremiah 43:7</a>), but also in more inland places, in Noph (i.e., Memphis, see on <a href="/jeremiah/2-16.htm">Jeremiah 2:16</a>) and the land of Pathros (lxx &#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;, Egypt.
