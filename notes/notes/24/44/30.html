The king thus named—the Apries of Herod. II., 161, 163, 169—was the son of Psammis, and reigned for twenty-five years. He attacked Sidon by land and Tyre by sea, presumably before Nebuchadnezzar’s invasion of Phœnicia, and then sent his armies against Cyrene. The issue of that campaign was disastrous, and his subjects revolted. His general, Amasis, who was sent to pacify the rebels, put himself at their head. Apries was deposed, kept in honourable imprisonment at Sais for a time, and afterwards strangled. His reign extended from B.C. 594 to 569. Jeremiah probably delivered his prediction <span class= "ital">circ. </span>B.C. 580, and it is the last recorded event in his life. A late Christian tradition, resting probably on a Jewish one, states that then, or shortly afterwards, the Egyptian Jews, irritated by his reproaches, rose up against him and stoned him to death.

"His enemies" refer to Amasis, &c.; the words are accurately chosen, so as not to refer to Nebuchadnezzar, who is not mentioned till the end of the verse, and in connection with Zedekiah (Eze 20:3; 30:21). Amasis' civil war with Hophra pioneered the way for Nebuchadnezzar's invasion in the twenty-third year of his reign [Josephus, Antiquities, 10.11].   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/44.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Pharaoh was a name common to all the Egyptian kings, as may be learned from <span class="bld"><a href="/genesis/12-15.htm" title="The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.">Genesis 12:15</a> 41:1 <a href="/exodus/1-8.htm" title="Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph.">Exodus 1:8</a>,11</span>; but they had besides that name another peculiar to them.

The Targum renders it Pharaoh the broken; and the Syriac version Pharaoh the lame: now it is here predicted as a sign of the destruction of the Jews in Egypt, which should follow after, that God would deliver this king <p>into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of them that seek his life; either into the hands of his rebellious subjects, headed by Amasis, by whom he was kept alive for a while after taken, and then put to death, as Herodotus reports; or rather into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar; for Josephus says (m), that he, in the twenty third year of his reign, which was four or five years after the destruction of Jerusalem, having subdued the Syrians, Ammonites, and Moabites, entered Egypt in a hostile manner, and slew the then remaining king, and set up another; and this is confirmed by what follows: <p>as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and that sought his life; in like manner, and as sure as he had done the one, he would do the other; and he puts the Jews in mind of what he had done by him, and which they had full and certain knowledge of; and might from hence conclude that this also would be accomplished, here given as a sign of their own ruin; and which, when they saw come to pass, might know that it was at hand; and, indeed, the king of Egypt, in whom they trusted, being taken by his enemies, and his country wasted, they must in course fall a prey to the conqueror. <p>(l) Euterpe, sive l. 2. c. 161, 162, 169. &amp; Melpomene, sive l. 4. c. 159.

"And Jeremiah said unto all the people, and unto all the women, Hear the word of Jahveh, all of Judah that are in the land of Egypt; <a href="/jeremiah/44-25.htm">Jeremiah 44:25</a>. Thus saith Jahve of hosts, the God of Israel: Ye and your wives have both spoken with your mouth, and fulfilled it with your hands, saying, We will assuredly perform our vows which we have vowed, by burning incense to the queen of heaven, and by pouring out libations to her: ye will by all means perform your vows, and carry out your vows. <a href="/jeremiah/44-26.htm">Jeremiah 44:26</a>. Therefore hear the word of Jahveh, all Judah that dwell in the land of Egypt: Behold, I have sworn by my great name, saith Jahveh, truly my name shall no more be named in the mouth of any man of Judah, saying, 'As the Lord Jahveh liveth,' in all the land of Egypt. <a href="/jeremiah/44-27.htm">Jeremiah 44:27</a>. Behold, I will watch over them for evil, and not for good; and all the men of Judah that are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by famine, till they are annihilated. <a href="/jeremiah/44-28.htm">Jeremiah 44:28</a>. And those who escape the sword shall return out of the land of Egypt to the land of Judah, a small number; and all the remnant of Judah, that went to the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall know whose word shall stand, mine or theirs. <a href="/jeremiah/44-29.htm">Jeremiah 44:29</a>. And this shall be the sign to you, saith Jahveh, that I will punish you in this place, that ye may know that my words shall surely rise up against you for evil: <a href="/jeremiah/44-30.htm">Jeremiah 44:30</a>. Thus hath Jahveh spoken, Behold, I will give Pharaoh-Hophra into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of those who seek his life, just as I have given Zedekiah the king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, who was his enemy, and sought his life."<p>After refuting the false assertion of the people, Jeremiah once more announces to them, on behalf of God, in the most solemn manner, the punishment of extermination by sword and famine in Egypt; this he does for the purpose of giving the greatest possible emphasis to his warning against persevering in idolatry. For substance, this announcement is similar to that of <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-11.htm">Jeremiah 44:11-14</a>, but the expression is stronger. Even in the summary account of their offences, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-25.htm">Jeremiah 44:25</a>, the words are so chosen and arranged as to bring out clearly the determination of the people to persevere in worshipping the queen of heaven. "As for you and your wives, ye have spoken with your mouth and fulfilled it with your hand" (on the Vav consec. attached to &#1514;&#1468;&#1491;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1504;&#1492;, cf. Ewald, 344, b), i.e., ye have uttered vows and then carried them out; for ye say, We must keep the vows that we have vowed. It is to be observed that the verbs &#1514;&#1468;&#1491;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1504;&#1492;, and in the concluding portion &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1497;&#1502;&#1504;&#1492; and &#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492;, are feminine, since the address chiefly applies to the wives, who clung most tenaciously to idolatry. In the clause '&#1492;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501; &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1497;&#1502;&#1504;&#1492; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;, "ye will make your vows and perform them," there is unmistakeable irony, in which the reference is to the wilfulness of the people in this idolatry. This &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; is shown by the inf. abs. &#1492;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501;, which strengthens &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1497;&#1502;&#1504;&#1492;. "To establish vows," i.e., to make them, was not a thing commanded, but left to one's free determination. Hence, also, no appeal to the maxim that vows which have been made or uttered must be fulfilled, can justify the making of the vows. The form &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1497;&#1502;&#1504;&#1492; for &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1502;&#1504;&#1492; is an unusual one; and the &#1497; which the Hirik takes after it is occasioned by the form &#1492;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501;; cf. Ewald, 196, c. - The announcement of the punishment is introduced by a solemn oath on the part of God. Jahveh swears by His great name, i.e., as the one who has shown Himself God by His mighty deeds - who has the power of keeping His word. The name is, of course, only a manifestation of His existence. &#1488;&#1501; as a particle used in swearing  equals  certainly not. His name shall no more be named in the mouth of any Jew in the land of Egypt, i.e., be used in asseverations, because all the Jews in Egypt shall be exterminated. On the expression, "Behold, I will watch over them," etc., cf. <a href="/jeremiah/31-28.htm">Jeremiah 31:28</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/21-10.htm">Jeremiah 21:10</a>. In <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-28.htm">Jeremiah 44:28</a>, it is more exactly stated that only a few individuals shall escape the sword and return to Judah; thus, no one shall remain behind in Egypt. By this judgment, all the remnant of Judah that went to Egypt shall find out whose word - Jahveh's or theirs - will endure, i.e., prove true. &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497; properly depends on &#1491;&#1489;&#1512;, "the word from me or from them" (the people). </body></html>
