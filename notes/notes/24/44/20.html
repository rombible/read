Since they were determined to persist in their idolatry, God would go on to punish them. What little remains of religion were among them, would be lost. The creature-comforts and confidences from which we promise ourselves most, may fail as soon as those from which we promise ourselves least; and all are what God makes them, not what we fancy them to be.

This is immediately afterwards more exactly specified by '&#1500;&#1492;&#1499;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;, to exterminate the whole of you, without an exception. As to the enumeration "man and woman," etc., cf. <a href="/1_samuel/15-3.htm">1 Samuel 15:3</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/22-19.htm">1 Samuel 22:19</a>. The infs. &#1500;&#1492;&#1499;&#1506;&#1497;&#1505;&#1504;&#1497; and &#1500;&#1511;&#1496;&#1468;&#1512; are used as gerundives: "inasmuch as (through this that) ye provoke me." For the expression "the works of your hands," see on <a href="/jeremiah/1-16.htm">Jeremiah 1:16</a>. In <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-8.htm">Jeremiah 44:8</a>, an object must be supplied from <a href="/jeremiah/44-7.htm">Jeremiah 44:7</a> for the expression &#1500;&#1502;&#1506;&#1503; &#1492;&#1499;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; &#1500;&#1499;&#1501;; for, to take &#1500;&#1499;&#1501; (with Hitzig) in a reflexive sense is a very harsh construction. On '&#1500;&#1511;&#1500;&#1500;&#1492; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;, cf. <a href="/jeremiah/42-18.htm">Jeremiah 42:18</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/26-6.htm">Jeremiah 26:6</a>. The answer to the question now asked follows in <a href="/jeremiah/44-9.htm">Jeremiah 44:9</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-10.htm">Jeremiah 44:10</a>, in the form of the further question, whether they have forgotten those former sins, and that these sins have been the cause of the evil which has befallen the land. The interrogation expresses the reproach that they have been able to forget both, as is evidenced by their continuance in sin. In <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-9.htm">Jeremiah 44:9</a>, the expression "the evil deeds of his wives" (&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1493;) is remarkable. Hitzig and Ngelsbach, following Kimchi, refer the suffix to the kings, since there was always but one king at a time. But this is an unnatural explanation; the suffix refers to Judah as a nation, and is used in order to comprehend the wives of the fathers and of the kings together. It is quite arbitrary in Ewald and Graf to change &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1493; to &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493;, following the lxx &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;; for these translators have mutilated the text by the omission of the following &#1493;&#1488;&#1514; &#1512;&#1506;&#1514;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501;. &#1512;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514; &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1493; is not merely conserved, but even required, by &#1493;&#1488;&#1514; &#1512;&#1506;&#1514; &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501;. But the prophet gives special prominence to the evil deeds of the wives, since it was they who were most zealous in worshipping the queen of heaven; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/44-15.htm">Jeremiah 44:15</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/44-19.htm">Jeremiah 44:19</a>. &#1500;&#1488; &#1491;&#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;, "they have not been crushed," viz., by repentance and sorrow for these sins. The transition to the third person is not merely accounted for by the fact that the subject treated of is the sins of the fathers and of the present generation, - for, as is shown by the expression "till this day," the prophet has chiefly his own contemporaries in view; but he speaks of these in the third person, to signify the indignation with which he turns away from men so difficult to reform. On the expression, "they had not walked in my law," cf. <a href="/jeremiah/26-4.htm">Jeremiah 26:4</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/9-12.htm">Jeremiah 9:12</a>. For this the Lord will punish them severely, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-11.htm">Jeremiah 44:11-14</a>. All those who have fled to Egypt, with the intention of remaining there, will be quite exterminated. On "Behold, I will set my face," etc., cf. <a href="/jeremiah/21-10.htm">Jeremiah 21:10</a>. "For evil" is more exactly defined by "to cut off all Judah," i.e., those of Judah who are in Egypt, not those who are in Babylon. This limitation of the words "all Judah" is necessarily required by the context, and is plainly expressed in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-12.htm">Jeremiah 44:12</a>, where "Judah" is specified as "the remnant of Judah that were determined to go to Egypt." &#1500;&#1511;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; has the meaning of taking away, as in <a href="/jeremiah/15-15.htm">Jeremiah 15:15</a>. &#1493;&#1514;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; are to be taken by themselves; and &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1502;&#1510;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, as is shown by the accents, is to be attached to what follows, on which, too, the emphasis is placed; in like manner, '&#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1512;&#1489;  are to be attached to the succeeding verb. The arrangement of the words, like the accumulation of sentences all expressing the same meaning, reveals the spirit of the address in which God vents His wrath. On "they shall become an execration," etc., see <a href="/jeremiah/42-18.htm">Jeremiah 42:18</a>. In <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-13.htm">Jeremiah 44:13</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-14.htm">Jeremiah 44:14</a>, the threatened extermination is further set forth. Those who dwelling Egypt shall be punished with sword, famine, and plague, like Jerusalem. The inhabitants of Egypt generally are meant; and by the judgment which is to fall on that country, the remnant of Judah there shall be so completely destroyed, that none shall escape. The leading member of the sentence is continued by &#1493;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;, "and that they should return to the land of Judah, after which their soul longs, that they may live there." A reason is further assigned, and with this the address, reduced within becoming limits, concludes: "for there shall return none except (&#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1488;&#1501;) fugitives," i.e., except a few individual fugitives who shall come back. This last clause shows that we are not to understand the declaration "none shall escape" in the strictest meaning of the words. Those who escape and return to Judah shall be so few, in comparison with those who shall perish in Egypt, as to be quite inconsiderable. Cf. the like instance of a seeming contradiction in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-27.htm">Jeremiah 44:27</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/44-28.htm">Jeremiah 44:28</a>. On &#1504;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488; &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501;, cf. <a href="/jeremiah/22-27.htm">Jeremiah 22:27</a>. </body></html>
