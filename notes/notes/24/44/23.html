Since they were determined to persist in their idolatry, God would go on to punish them. What little remains of religion were among them, would be lost. The creature-comforts and confidences from which we promise ourselves most, may fail as soon as those from which we promise ourselves least; and all are what God makes them, not what we fancy them to be. Well-grounded hopes of our having a part in the Divine mercy, are always united with repentance and obedience.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/44.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Could no longer bear - The prophet corrects in these words the error of their argument in <a href="/jeremiah/44-17.htm">Jeremiah 44:17</a>.

That which is observable is, that though the prophet was but one against many, yet he feareth not their faces: the substance of what he saith is this, that they interpreted Godâ€™s voice in his providences toward their country directly contrary to the true sense of it. They concluded that their omission of late to burn incense to the sun, moon, and stars was the cause why it was so ill with them; as if these were animate beings, and the Supreme Being, whereas they were but creatures. Or as if it were the will of the Supreme Being to be adored and worshipped in them, or before statues and images represented by them, whereas the will of God was directly contrary: and as he in the second commandment had forbidden any such worship, because he was a jealous God; so he had for the breach of that commandment, by their burning incense to these creatures, burned up their houses and temple, and brought their nation into that misery into which they were come: from whence may be observed how ill an argument for any religious worship antiquity is, unless we by it mean what is most ancient; as also that prescription in that which is false in the worship of God justifieth none. Nor is it a good conclusion that those who lived nearest to the primitive institution are most likely to have done best, as having the best means to know what is truly primitive. Idolatry was as old as Laban, and the worst of idolatry (offering children to Molech) was older than the Levitical law, if not as old as Serug. In matters of worship the word of God is a sufficient rule, we need not plead antiquity, nor the <span class="ital">practice of our fathers</span>. Error is not capable of being justified by tradition or prescription. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/44.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And because ye have burnt incense,.... Not to Jehovah, but to the queen of heaven; which they owned they did, and determined they would; asserting it was better with them when they did it than when they omitted it; for which reason the prophet particularly mentions it, and assigns it as the cause of the present ruin and destruction of their land, city, and temple: <p>and because ye have sinned against the Lord; by worshipping idols; all sin is against the Lord, but especially idolatry: <p>and have not obeyed the voice of the Lord; by his prophets, who cautioned them against idolatry, reproved them for it, and told them what would be the consequence of it; but this they hearkened not unto, which was an aggravation of their sin: <p>nor walked in his law; the moral law, according to it; which is a rule of walk and conversation: <p>nor in his statutes, nor in his testimonies; as not in the moral law, so neither in the ceremonial law, and the rites of that; nor in the judicial law, and the testifications of the will of God in either of them: <p>therefore this evil is happened unto you, as at this day: that is, the desolation on their land, as in <a href="/jeremiah/44-23.htm">Jeremiah 44:23</a>; See Gill on <a href="/jeremiah/44-23.htm">Jeremiah 44:23</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/44.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Because ye have burned incense, and because ye have sinned against the LORD, and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD, nor walked in his law, nor in his statutes, nor in his testimonies; therefore this evil is happened unto you, as at this day.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/44.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The answer of the people to this threatening address. - <a href="/jeremiah/44-15.htm">Jeremiah 44:15</a>. "Then all the men who knew that their wives burned incense to other gods, and all the women standing [there], a great multitude, and all the people who dwelt in the land of Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying, <a href="/jeremiah/44-16.htm">Jeremiah 44:16</a>. [As for] the word which thou hast spoken unto us in the name of Jahveh, we will not hearken unto thee: <a href="/jeremiah/44-17.htm">Jeremiah 44:17</a>. But we will certainly perform every word that has proceeded out of our own mouth, by burning incense to the queen of heaven, and pouring out libations to her, just as we have done, we and our fathers, our kings and our princes, in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem; and we were filled with bread, and became prosperous, and saw no evil. <a href="/jeremiah/44-18.htm">Jeremiah 44:18</a>. But since we ceased to offer incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out libations to her, we have been in want of everything, and are consumed by sword and famine. <a href="/jeremiah/44-19.htm">Jeremiah 44:19</a>. And when we [women] have been burning incense to the queen of heaven, and poured out libations to her, have we made cakes to her without our husbands, making an image of her, and offering libations to her?" To the word of the prophet the men and women oppose their pretended experience, that the adoration of the queen of heaven has brought them comfort and prosperity, while the neglect of this worship, on the other hand, has brought want and misfortune. No doubt they inferred this, by the argument post hoc, ergo propter hoc, from the fact that, after idolatry had been rooted out by Josiah, adversity had befallen the land of Judah; while, up till that time, the kingdom of Judah had been independent, and, for more than a century before, had been spared the suffering of misfortune. Thus, through their blindness, peculiar to the natural man, they had overlooked the minor transient evils with which the Lord visits His people when they sin. Not till near the end of Josiah's reign did misfortune fall on Judah: this was when the Egyptian army, under Pharaoh-Necho, marched through Palestine; Josiah was slain in the battle he had lost, the land was laid waste by the enemy, and its inhabitants perished by sword and famine. In <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-15.htm">Jeremiah 44:15</a>, those who are represented speaking are all the men who knew of their wives' idolatry, i.e., who permitted it, and all the women, "a great company," i.e., gathered together in great numbers, and all the rest of the people who lived in Egypt. The specification "in Pathros" is not in apposition to the words "in the land of Egypt," but belongs to the verb &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;; it tells where the gathering took place, viz., in a district of Upper Egypt. From the presence of a large number of women, we may conclude that the assembly was a festival in honour of the queen of heaven. The former portion of <a href="/jeremiah/44-16.htm">Jeremiah 44:16</a> forms an absolute clause, from &#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; to &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501;, "as regards the word which...we will not listen to thee," i.e., with regard to this word we obey thee not. The expression, "the word which has gone forth out of our mouth," points to the uttering of vows: cf. <a href="/numbers/30-13.htm">Numbers 30:13</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/23-24.htm">Deuteronomy 23:24</a>. '&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; means "all that we have uttered as a vow," every vow to offer incense, etc., i.e., to present meat and drink offerings to the queen of heaven, - that shall we keep, fulfil, as we and our fathers have done in the land of Judah. On this mode of worship, cf. <a href="/jeremiah/7-17.htm">Jeremiah 7:17</a>., and the remarks there made. "And we were satisfied with bread," i.e., in consequence of this worship we had amply sufficient food. Towbiym &#1496;&#1493;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501;, "good," well, comfortable; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/22-16.htm">Jeremiah 22:16</a>. &#1502;&#1503; &#1488;&#1494;, "from that time"  equals  since. &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; is for &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, from &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1501;, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/17-1.htm">Numbers 17:1-13</a> :28; cf. Ewald, 197, a. To this statement on the part of the men, the women further add, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-19.htm">Jeremiah 44:19</a>, that they do not engage in this sacrificial worship or prepare the sacrificial cakes without their husbands, i.e., without their knowledge and approval. This is put forward by the women in the way of self-vindication; for, according to the law, <a href="/numbers/30-9.htm">Numbers 30:9</a>., the husband could annul, i.e., declare not binding, any vow which had been made by his wife without his knowledge. Although it is women who are speaking, the masc. &#1502;&#1511;&#1496;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; is used as being the gender which most commonly occurs; it also pretty often stands for the feminine. The inf. constr. &#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;&#1505;&#1468;&#1498; (with &#1500;) is here employed, in conformity with later usage, instead of the inf. abs., for the finite verb, by way of continuation; cf. Ewald, 351, c, where, however, many passages have been set down as falling under this rule that demand a different explanation. The meaning of &#1500;&#1492;&#1506;&#1510;&#1489;&#1492; is disputed; the final &#1492; is a suffix, written with Raphe, though Mappik also occurs in some MSS. The Hiphil of this verb is found elsewhere only in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/78-40.htm">Psalm 78:40</a>, and there in the signification of vexing, grieving, like the Piel in <a href="/isaiah/63-10.htm">Isaiah 63:10</a>; <a href="/psalms/66-6.htm">Psalm 66:6</a>. Ewald translates "in order to move her," i.e., make her well-disposed, - but quite arbitrarily, for to provoke is the very opposite of rendering propitious. The verb &#1506;&#1510;&#1468;&#1489; also signifies "to form, shape," <a href="/job/10-8.htm">Job 10:8</a>; and in this sense the Hiphil is used here, "in order to put them into shape," i.e., to form the moon-goddess (queen of heaven) in or on the sacrificial cakes (Kimchi, Raschi, Dahler, Maurer, Graf, etc.). The sacrificial cakes (&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, see on <a href="/jeremiah/7-18.htm">Jeremiah 7:18</a>) probably had the form of a crescent, or even of the full moon, like the &#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; of the Greeks, which used to be offered in Athens at the time of the full moon in the month of Munychion, to Artemis, as goddess of the moon; cf. Hermann, gottesdienstliche Alterthmer der Griechen, 2 Ausg. S. 146, Anm. 13, u. S. 414. </body></html>
