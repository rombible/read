It becomes us to warn men of the danger of sin with all seriousness: Oh, do not do it! If you love God, do not, for it is provoking to him; if you love your own souls, do not, for it is destructive to them. Let conscience do this for us in the hour of temptation. The Jews whom God sent into the land of the Chaldeans, were there, by the power of God's grace, weaned from idolatry; but those who went by their own perverse will into the land of the Egyptians, were there more attached than ever to their idolatries. When we thrust ourselves without cause or call into places of temptation, it is just with God to leave us to ourselves. If we walk contrary to God, he will walk contrary to us.

Of all those now going down to Egypt none shall return to Judaea except a few miserable fugitives, who shall steal away as men who flee in battle <a href="/2_samuel/19-3.htm">2 Samuel 19:3</a>. For really years Jewish settlers had gone to Egypt in great numbers, and these old settlers would be treated in the same way as the Egyptians, but these fugitives, with no knowledge of the Egyptian language or ways, would have no friends in the country to aid them, and would also be recognized by the Chaldaeans as inveterate enemies, and mercilessly slain. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/44.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. none &#8230; shall escape &#8230; that they should return, &c.&#8212;The Jews had gone to Egypt with the idea that a return to Judea, which they thought hopeless to their brethren in Babylon, would be an easy matter to themselves in Egypt: the exact reverse should happen in the case of each respectively. The Jews whom God sent to Babylon were there weaned from idolatry, and were restored; those who went to Egypt by their perverse will were hardened in idolatry, and perished there.<p>have a desire&#8212;literally, "lift up (their) soul," that is, their hopes (compare Jer 22:27, Margin; De 24:15, Margin).<p>none shall return but such as shall escape&#8212;namely, the "small number" (Jer 44:28) who were brought by force into Egypt, as Jeremiah and Baruch, and those who, in accordance with Jeremiah's advice, should flee from Egypt before the arrival of the Chaldeans (see on [967]Jer 42:17). Calvin less probably refers the words to the return of the exiles in Babylon, which the Jews in Egypt regarded as hopeless.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/44.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> There is a great variety in the reading of the words, <span class="bld"><a href="/jeremiah/44-14.htm" title="So that none of the remnant of Judah, which are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall escape or remain, that they should return into the land of Judah, to the which they have a desire to return to dwell there: for none shall return but such as shall escape.">Jeremiah 44:14</a></span>; some reading <span class="ital">besides such as have a desire to return</span>; others, <span class="ital">although they have a desire to return</span>; others, <span class="ital">for they have a desire to return</span>. The words seem to hint that these Jews went into the land of Egypt, not with a design to live there always, but to stay for a while till the heat of the Chaldeans in inquiring after the blood of Gedaliah should be over, then thinking to return into their own country; which one would think were true, considering it not only as their native soil, but also a place where was now room enough, and they might live in much greater plenty than they could in Egypt. The only difficulty is in the last words, compared with what in the same verse went before; it is said in the beginning of the verse that <span class="ital">none of them should escape</span>, and in the close, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">none shall return but such as shall escape.</span> But reason will guide us to interpret the first <span class="ital">none</span> in a restrained sense, i.e. none of those who have been the authors of this counsel and rebellion against God, and who went into Egypt willingly; for none can think that God involved Jeremiah and Baruch who were in Egypt (at least the first of them) in the same punishment with which he punished the rebellious Jews. Or none of those who in Egypt have burnt incense to idols, and defiled themselves with the idolatry of Egypt; but there shall some escape, such as have been forced into Egypt against their wills; and such as, being so forced, when they came here did not fall in with the idolatry of the Egyptians, (for we may gather from the next verse that all of them did not,) these men shall again return into the land of Judah. This to me seemeth the fairest and most probable sense of the words. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/44.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>So that none of the remnant of Judah,....

Some understand this of those that should escape out of Babylon; that none should return to Judea but those of that captivity, who should be released by the proclamation of Cyrus.

This is immediately afterwards more exactly specified by '&#1500;&#1492;&#1499;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;, to exterminate the whole of you, without an exception. As to the enumeration "man and woman," etc., cf. <a href="/1_samuel/15-3.htm">1 Samuel 15:3</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/22-19.htm">1 Samuel 22:19</a>. The infs. &#1500;&#1492;&#1499;&#1506;&#1497;&#1505;&#1504;&#1497; and &#1500;&#1511;&#1496;&#1468;&#1512; are used as gerundives: "inasmuch as (through this that) ye provoke me." For the expression "the works of your hands," see on <a href="/jeremiah/1-16.htm">Jeremiah 1:16</a>. In <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-8.htm">Jeremiah 44:8</a>, an object must be supplied from <a href="/jeremiah/44-7.htm">Jeremiah 44:7</a> for the expression &#1500;&#1502;&#1506;&#1503; &#1492;&#1499;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; &#1500;&#1499;&#1501;; for, to take &#1500;&#1499;&#1501; (with Hitzig) in a reflexive sense is a very harsh construction. On '&#1500;&#1511;&#1500;&#1500;&#1492; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;, cf. <a href="/jeremiah/42-18.htm">Jeremiah 42:18</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/26-6.htm">Jeremiah 26:6</a>. The answer to the question now asked follows in <a href="/jeremiah/44-9.htm">Jeremiah 44:9</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-10.htm">Jeremiah 44:10</a>, in the form of the further question, whether they have forgotten those former sins, and that these sins have been the cause of the evil which has befallen the land. The interrogation expresses the reproach that they have been able to forget both, as is evidenced by their continuance in sin. In <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-9.htm">Jeremiah 44:9</a>, the expression "the evil deeds of his wives" (&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1493;) is remarkable. Hitzig and Ngelsbach, following Kimchi, refer the suffix to the kings, since there was always but one king at a time. But this is an unnatural explanation; the suffix refers to Judah as a nation, and is used in order to comprehend the wives of the fathers and of the kings together. It is quite arbitrary in Ewald and Graf to change &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1493; to &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493;, following the lxx &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;; for these translators have mutilated the text by the omission of the following &#1493;&#1488;&#1514; &#1512;&#1506;&#1514;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501;. &#1512;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514; &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1493; is not merely conserved, but even required, by &#1493;&#1488;&#1514; &#1512;&#1506;&#1514; &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501;. But the prophet gives special prominence to the evil deeds of the wives, since it was they who were most zealous in worshipping the queen of heaven; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/44-15.htm">Jeremiah 44:15</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/44-19.htm">Jeremiah 44:19</a>. &#1500;&#1488; &#1491;&#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;, "they have not been crushed," viz., by repentance and sorrow for these sins. The transition to the third person is not merely accounted for by the fact that the subject treated of is the sins of the fathers and of the present generation, - for, as is shown by the expression "till this day," the prophet has chiefly his own contemporaries in view; but he speaks of these in the third person, to signify the indignation with which he turns away from men so difficult to reform. On the expression, "they had not walked in my law," cf. <a href="/jeremiah/26-4.htm">Jeremiah 26:4</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/9-12.htm">Jeremiah 9:12</a>. For this the Lord will punish them severely, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-11.htm">Jeremiah 44:11-14</a>. All those who have fled to Egypt, with the intention of remaining there, will be quite exterminated. On "Behold, I will set my face," etc., cf. <a href="/jeremiah/21-10.htm">Jeremiah 21:10</a>. "For evil" is more exactly defined by "to cut off all Judah," i.e., those of Judah who are in Egypt, not those who are in Babylon. This limitation of the words "all Judah" is necessarily required by the context, and is plainly expressed in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-12.htm">Jeremiah 44:12</a>, where "Judah" is specified as "the remnant of Judah that were determined to go to Egypt." &#1500;&#1511;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; has the meaning of taking away, as in <a href="/jeremiah/15-15.htm">Jeremiah 15:15</a>. &#1493;&#1514;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; are to be taken by themselves; and &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1502;&#1510;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, as is shown by the accents, is to be attached to what follows, on which, too, the emphasis is placed; in like manner, '&#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1512;&#1489;  are to be attached to the succeeding verb. The arrangement of the words, like the accumulation of sentences all expressing the same meaning, reveals the spirit of the address in which God vents His wrath. On "they shall become an execration," etc., see <a href="/jeremiah/42-18.htm">Jeremiah 42:18</a>. In <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-13.htm">Jeremiah 44:13</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-14.htm">Jeremiah 44:14</a>, the threatened extermination is further set forth. Those who dwelling Egypt shall be punished with sword, famine, and plague, like Jerusalem. The inhabitants of Egypt generally are meant; and by the judgment which is to fall on that country, the remnant of Judah there shall be so completely destroyed, that none shall escape. The leading member of the sentence is continued by &#1493;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;, "and that they should return to the land of Judah, after which their soul longs, that they may live there." A reason is further assigned, and with this the address, reduced within becoming limits, concludes: "for there shall return none except (&#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1488;&#1501;) fugitives," i.e., except a few individual fugitives who shall come back. This last clause shows that we are not to understand the declaration "none shall escape" in the strictest meaning of the words. Those who escape and return to Judah shall be so few, in comparison with those who shall perish in Egypt, as to be quite inconsiderable. Cf. the like instance of a seeming contradiction in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-27.htm">Jeremiah 44:27</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/44-28.htm">Jeremiah 44:28</a>. On &#1504;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488; &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501;, cf. <a href="/jeremiah/22-27.htm">Jeremiah 22:27</a>. </body></html>
