He went, digged (&#1495;&#1508;&#1512;, whence we see that the hiding in the cleft of the rock was a burying in the rocky soil of the Euphrates bank), and found the girdle marred, fit for nothing. These words correspond to the effect which the exile was designed to have, which it has had, on the wicked, idolatrous race. The ungodly should as Moses' law, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/26-36.htm">Leviticus 26:36</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/26-39.htm">Leviticus 26:39</a>, declared, perish in the land of their enemies; the land of their enemies will devour them, and they that remain shall pine or moulder away in their iniquities and in the iniquities of their fathers. This mouldering (&#1497;&#1502;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;) is well reproduced in the marring (&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1514;) of the girdle. It is no contradiction to this, that a part of the people will be rescued from the captivity and brought back to the land of their fathers. For although the girdle which the prophet had put on his loins symbolized the people at large, yet the decay of the same at the Euphrates sets forth only the physical decay of the ungodly part of the people, as <a href="/jeremiah/13-10.htm">Jeremiah 13:10</a> intimates in clear words: "This evil people that refuses to hear the word of the Lord, etc., shall be as this girdle." The Lord will mar the &#1490;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1503; of Judah and Jerusalem. The word means highness in both a good and in an evil sense, glory and self-glory. Here it is used with the latter force. This is shown both by the context, and by a comparison of the passage <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/26-19.htm">Leviticus 26:19</a>, that God will break the &#1504;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1503; of the people by sore judgments, which is the foundation of the present <a href="/jeremiah/13-9.htm">Jeremiah 13:9</a>. - In <a href="/jeremiah/13-11.htm">Jeremiah 13:11</a> the meaning of the girdle is given, in order to explain the threatening in <a href="/jeremiah/13-9.htm">Jeremiah 13:9</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/13-10.htm">Jeremiah 13:10</a>. As the girdle lies on the loins of a man, so the Lord hath laid Israel on Himself, that it may be to Him for a people and for a praise, for a glory and an adornment, inasmuch as He designed to set it above all other nations and to make it very glorious; cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-19.htm">Deuteronomy 26:19</a>, whither these words point back. </body></html>
