The “bottle” in this case is not the “skin” commonly used for that purpose, but the earthen jar or flagon, the “potter’s vessel” of <a href="/isaiah/30-14.htm" title="And he shall break it as the breaking of the potters' vessel that is broken in pieces; he shall not spare: so that there shall not be found in the bursting of it a shard to take fire from the hearth, or to take water with out of the pit.">Isaiah 30:14</a>, the “pitcher” of <a href="/lamentations/4-2.htm" title="The precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold, how are they esteemed as earthen pitchers, the work of the hands of the potter!">Lamentations 4:2</a>. So taken we find an anticipation of the imagery of <a href="/jeremiah/19-1.htm" title="Thus said the LORD, Go and get a potter's earthen bottle, and take of the ancients of the people, and of the ancients of the priests;">Jeremiah 19:1</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/19-10.htm" title="Then shall you break the bottle in the sight of the men that go with you,">Jeremiah 19:10</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/25-15.htm" title="For thus said the LORD God of Israel to me; Take the wine cup of this fury at my hand, and cause all the nations, to whom I send you, to drink it.">Jeremiah 25:15</a>. The prophet is bidden to go and proclaim to the people a dark saying, which in its literal sense would seem to them the idlest of all truisms. They would not understand that the “wine” of which he spoke was the wrath of Jehovah, and therefore they would simply repeat his words half in astonishment, half in mockery, “Do we not know this? What need to hear it from a prophet’s lips?”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/13.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/jeremiah/13-12.htm" title="Therefore you shall speak to them this word; Thus said the LORD God of Israel, Every bottle shall be filled with wine: and they shall say to you, Do we not certainly know that every bottle shall be filled with wine?">Jeremiah 13:12</a></span>. <span class="ital">Therefore </span>— Because the end intended by my goodness has not been answered upon them; <span class="ital">thou shall speak unto them this word </span>— Thou shall show them the destruction coming upon them by another emblem. <span class="ital">Thus saith the Lord, Every bottle shall be filled with wine </span>— God’s judgments are often represented under the figure of a cup full of intoxicating liquor: see this metaphor pursued at large, <a href="/jeremiah/25-15.htm" title="For thus said the LORD God of Israel to me; Take the wine cup of this fury at my hand, and cause all the nations, to whom I send you, to drink it.">Jeremiah 25:15</a>, &c.

But Blaney thinks their answer, <span class="ital">Do we not know, </span>&c., implies that, by a wilful mistake, they construed his words as “meant to tell them of a plentiful vintage that was coming on, which would fill all their wine-vessels; and of this they claimed to be as good judges as he, from the promising appearance of the vineyards. As if they said, Do you tell us this as a piece of news, or a supernatural discovery? Is it not evident to us as well as to you? The prophet is therefore directed to deal more plainly with them, and to tell them that the wine he meant was not such as would exhilarate, but such as would intoxicate; being no other than what would be poured out of the wine-cup of God’s fury, to the subversion of all ranks and orders of men among them.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/13.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>13:12-17 As the bottle was fitted to hold the wine, so the sins of the people made them vessels of wrath, fitted for the judgments of God; with which they should be filled till they caused each other's destruction. The prophet exhorts them to give glory to God, by confessing their sins, humbling themselves in repentance, and returning to his service. Otherwise they would be carried into other countries in all the darkness of idolatry and wickedness. All misery, witnessed or foreseen, will affect a feeling mind, but the pious heart must mourn most over the afflictions of the Lord's flock.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Bottle - jar, the "potter's vessel" of <a href="/isaiah/30-14.htm">Isaiah 30:14</a> : a new symbol, but with the same meaning, the approaching destruction of Jerusalem <a href="/jeremiah/13-14.htm">Jeremiah 13:14</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12.

As they were used to hold water, milk, and other liquids, what the prophet said (namely, that they should be all filled with wine) was not, as the Jews' taunting reply implied, a truism even literally. The figurative sense which is what Jeremiah chiefly meant, they affected not to understand. As wine intoxicates, so God's wrath and judgments shall reduce them to that state of helpless distraction that they shall rush on to their own ruin (Jer 25:15; 49:12; Isa 51:17, 21, 22; 63:6).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> God by his prophet showeth them their ruin in another glass, he bids the prophet tell them that <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">every bottle should be filled with wine.</span> Wine was what they delighted in; <span class="bld"><a href="/hosea/3-1.htm" title="Then said the LORD to me, Go yet, love a woman beloved of her friend, yet an adulteress, according to the love of the LORD toward the children of Israel, who look to other gods, and love flagons of wine.">Hosea 3:1</a></span>, <span class="ital">they loved flagons of wine</span>, and were for those prophets that would prophesy to them of wine and strong drink, <span class="bld"><a href="/micah/2-11.htm" title="If a man walking in the spirit and falsehood do lie, saying, I will prophesy to you of wine and of strong drink; he shall even be the prophet of this people.">Micah 2:11</a></span>.

He went, digged (&#1495;&#1508;&#1512;, whence we see that the hiding in the cleft of the rock was a burying in the rocky soil of the Euphrates bank), and found the girdle marred, fit for nothing. These words correspond to the effect which the exile was designed to have, which it has had, on the wicked, idolatrous race. The ungodly should as Moses' law, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/26-36.htm">Leviticus 26:36</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/26-39.htm">Leviticus 26:39</a>, declared, perish in the land of their enemies; the land of their enemies will devour them, and they that remain shall pine or moulder away in their iniquities and in the iniquities of their fathers. This mouldering (&#1497;&#1502;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;) is well reproduced in the marring (&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1514;) of the girdle. It is no contradiction to this, that a part of the people will be rescued from the captivity and brought back to the land of their fathers. For although the girdle which the prophet had put on his loins symbolized the people at large, yet the decay of the same at the Euphrates sets forth only the physical decay of the ungodly part of the people, as <a href="/jeremiah/13-10.htm">Jeremiah 13:10</a> intimates in clear words: "This evil people that refuses to hear the word of the Lord, etc., shall be as this girdle." The Lord will mar the &#1490;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1503; of Judah and Jerusalem. The word means highness in both a good and in an evil sense, glory and self-glory. Here it is used with the latter force. This is shown both by the context, and by a comparison of the passage <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/26-19.htm">Leviticus 26:19</a>, that God will break the &#1504;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1503; of the people by sore judgments, which is the foundation of the present <a href="/jeremiah/13-9.htm">Jeremiah 13:9</a>. - In <a href="/jeremiah/13-11.htm">Jeremiah 13:11</a> the meaning of the girdle is given, in order to explain the threatening in <a href="/jeremiah/13-9.htm">Jeremiah 13:9</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/13-10.htm">Jeremiah 13:10</a>. As the girdle lies on the loins of a man, so the Lord hath laid Israel on Himself, that it may be to Him for a people and for a praise, for a glory and an adornment, inasmuch as He designed to set it above all other nations and to make it very glorious; cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-19.htm">Deuteronomy 26:19</a>, whither these words point back. </body></html>
