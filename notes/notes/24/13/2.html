And we have the explanation, ver. 9-11. The people of Israel had been to God as this girdle. He caused them to cleave to him by the law he gave them, the prophets he sent among them, and the favours he showed them. They had by their idolatries and sins buried themselves in foreign earth, mingled among the nations, and were so corrupted that they were good for nothing. If we are proud of learning, power, and outward privileges, it is just with God to wither them. The minds of men should be awakened to a sense of their guilt and danger; yet nothing will be effectual without the influences of the Spirit.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A linen girdle - The appointed dress of the priestly order (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/16-4.htm">Leviticus 16:4</a>, ...).<p>Put it not in water - i. e., do not wash it, and so let it represent the deep-grained pollution of the people. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 13<p>Jer 13:1-27.

[So Calvin]. The world he moved in was not the sensible, but the spiritual, world. Inward acts were, however, when it was possible and proper, materialized by outward performance, but not always, and necessarily so. The internal act made a naked statement more impressive and presented the subject when extending over long portions of space and time more concentrated. The interruption of Jeremiah's official duty by a journey of more than two hundred miles twice is not likely to have literally taken place.<p>1. put it upon thy loins, &c.&#8212;expressing the close intimacy wherewith Jehovah had joined Israel and Judah to Him (Jer 13:11).<p>linen&#8212;implying it was the inner garment next the skin, not the outer one.<p>put it not in water&#8212;signifying the moral filth of His people, like the literal filth of a garment worn constantly next the skin, without being washed (Jer 13:10).

The words: wheat they have sown, thorns they reap, are manifestly of the nature of a saw or proverb; certainly not merely with the force of meliora exspectaverant et venerunt pessima (Jerome); for sowing corresponds not to hoping or expecting, but to doing and undertaking. Their labour brings them the reverse of what they aimed at or sought to attain. To understand the words directly of the failure of the crop, as Ven., Ros., Hitz., Graf, Ng. prefer to do, is fair neither to text nor context. To reap thorns is not  equals  to have a bad harvest by reason of drought, blight, or the ravaging of enemies. The seed: wheat, the noblest grain, produces thorns, the very opposite of available fruit. And the context, too, excludes the thought of agriculture and "literal harvesting." The thought that the crop turned out a failure would be a very lame termination to a description of how the whole land was ravaged from end to end by the sword of the Lord. The verse forms a conclusion which sums up the threatening of <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-7.htm">Jeremiah 12:7-12</a>, to the effect that the people's sinful ongoings will bring them sore suffering, instead of the good fortune they hoped for. &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;, they have worn themselves out, exhausted their strength, and secured no profit. Thus shall ye be put to shame for your produce, ignominiously disappointed in your hopes for the issue of your labour.</body></html>
