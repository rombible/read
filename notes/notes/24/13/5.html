And we have the explanation, ver. 9-11. The people of Israel had been to God as this girdle. He caused them to cleave to him by the law he gave them, the prophets he sent among them, and the favours he showed them. They had by their idolatries and sins buried themselves in foreign earth, mingled among the nations, and were so corrupted that they were good for nothing. If we are proud of learning, power, and outward privileges, it is just with God to wither them. The minds of men should be awakened to a sense of their guilt and danger; yet nothing will be effectual without the influences of the Spirit.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In a hole of the rock - "In a cleft of the rock." As there are no fissured rocks in Babylonia, the place where Jeremiah hid the girdle must have been somewhere in the upper part of the river. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. Euphrates&#8212;In order to support the view that Jeremiah's act was outward, Henderson considers that the Hebrew Phrath here is Ephratha, the original name of Beth-lehem, six miles south of Jerusalem, a journey easy to be made by Jeremiah. The non-addition of the word "river," which usually precedes Phrath, when meaning Euphrates, favors this view. But I prefer English Version. The Euphrates is specified as being near Babylon, the Jews future place of exile.<p>hole&#8212;typical of the prisons in which the Jews were to be confined.<p>the rock&#8212;some well-known rock.

Or, "in" (o) it; in a hole of the rock, upon the banks of it: <p>as the Lord commanded me: all this seems to be done not really, but visionally; it can hardly be thought that Jeremy should be sent on two such long journeys, on such an account, which would take up a considerable time to perform it in; but rather that he went and came in like manner as Ezekiel did, in the visions of God, from Chaldea to Jerusalem, and from thence to Chaldea again, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-3.htm">Ezekiel 8:3</a>, and so Maimonaides (p) was of opinion, as Kimchi on the place observes, that all this was done in a vision of prophecy. <p>(o) "in Euphrate", V.

What we are to understand by this is clear from the following infinitive clause: to swear in the name of Jahveh, viz., if they adopt the worship of Jahveh (for swearing is mentioned as one of the principal utterances of a religious confession). If they do so, then shall they be built in the midst of God's people, i.e., incorporated with it, and along with it favoured and blessed.</body></html>
