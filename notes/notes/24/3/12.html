These words were proclaimed toward the north; to Israel, the ten tribes, captive in Assyria. They are directed how to return. If we confess our sins, the Lord is faithful and just to forgive them. These promises are fully to come to pass in the bringing back the Jews in after-ages. God will graciously receive those that return to him; and by his grace, he takes them out from among the rest. The ark of the covenant was not found after the captivity. The whole of that dispensation was to be done away, which took place after the multitude of believers had been greatly increased by the conversion of the Gentiles, and of the Israelites scattered among them.

With his face thitherwards, towards Babylon, which lay north of Judea, and was the metropolis of Assyria, where the ten tribes were carried captive; and though they were dispersed in the cities of Media and Persia, which lay eastward, yet Babylon being the head of the empire, respect is had to that; not that the prophet was to go thither to them, or to prophesy in the land of the north, as the Targum paraphrases the words: for the word "go", as Jarchi observes, is only expressive of a command on the part of God; and of readiness, as Kimchi says, on the part of the prophet to obey, but not of local motion; he was to read these words, as the latter of these suggests, in Jerusalem, before the elders of Judah, with a respect to Israel, as if they were before him; and the design of this was to show that the Lord was gracious and merciful, and ready to receive backsliders; and to stimulate Judah to repentance, and to turn unto the Lord: <p>and say, return, thou backsliding Israel, saith the Lord not return from the land of their captivity, though that they shall return in the last day Kimchi thinks is here intimated; and Jarchi says some of them did return, in the eighteenth year of Josiah; but return from their idols to the living God: and for their encouragement it is added, <p>and I will not cause mine anger to fall upon you; or, "my face" (d); by frowning upon them, expressing displicency with them, and anger towards them; the meaning is, that he would not continue his resentments, or cause his anger to fall upon them any more, or at least not for ever, as Kimchi interprets it; he had caused his anger to fall upon them like a mighty storm of rain, by carrying them captive; but now he intimates, should they repent and return, he would remove his anger from them, and not cause it to return any more: <p>for I am merciful, saith the Lord; so he proclaimed himself before Moses, <a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6</a> and of this they had had often instances and proofs: <p>and I will not keep anger for ever; or, "thy sins", as the Targum; I will not mark and observe them, or reserve them for punishment, but will mercifully forgive them; See Gill on <a href="/jeremiah/3-5.htm">Jeremiah 3:5</a>. <p>(d)   "non faciam cadere facies meas super vos", Schmidt. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Go and proclaim these words toward <span class="cverse3">{o}</span> the north, and say, Return, thou backsliding Israel, saith the LORD; <i>and</i> I will not cause my anger to fall upon you: for I <i>am</i> merciful, saith the LORD, <i>and</i> I will not keep <i>anger</i> for ever.</span><p>(o) While the Israelites were now kept in captivity by the Assyrians, to whom he promises mercy, if they will repent.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">12</span>. <span class="ital">look in anger</span>] lit. as mg. <span class="ital">cause my countenance to fall upon you</span>.

"And Jahveh spake to me in the days of King Josiah, Hast thou seen what the backsliding one, Israel, hath done? she went up on every high mountain, and under every green tree, and played the harlot there. <a href="/jeremiah/3-7.htm">Jeremiah 3:7</a>. And I:thought: After she hath done all this, she will return to me; but she returned not. And the faithless one, her sister Judah, saw it. <a href="/jeremiah/3-8.htm">Jeremiah 3:8</a>. And I saw that, because the backsliding one, Israel, had committed adultery, and I had put her away, and had given her a bill of divorce, yet the faithless one, Judah, her sister, feared not even on this account, and went and played the harlot also. <a href="/jeremiah/3-9.htm">Jeremiah 3:9</a>. And it befell that for the noise of her whoredom the land was defiled, and she committed adultery with stone and wood. <a href="/jeremiah/3-10.htm">Jeremiah 3:10</a>. And yet with all this, the faithless one, her sister Judah, turned not to me with her whole heart, but with falsehood, saith Jahveh." The thought of these verses is this: notwithstanding that Judah has before its eyes the lot which Israel (of the ten tribes) has brought on itself by its obdurate apostasy from the covenant God, it will not be moved to true fear of God and real repentance. Viewing idolatry as spiritual whoredom, the prophet developes that train of thought by representing the two kingdoms as two adulterous sisters, calling the inhabitants of the ten tribes &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1492;, the backsliding, those of Judah &#1489;&#1468;&#1490;&#1493;&#1491;&#1492;, the faithless. On these names Venema well remarks: "Sorores propter unam eandemque stirpem, unde uterque populus fuit, et arctam ad se invicem relationem appellantur. Utraque fuit adultera propter idololatriam et faederis violationem; sed Israel vocatur uxor aversa; Juda vero perfida, quia Israel non tantum religionis sed et regni et civitatis respectu, adeoque palam erat a Deo alienata, Juda vero Deo et sedi regni ac religionis adfixa, sed nihilominus a Deo et cultu ejus defecerat, et sub externa specie populi Dei faedus ejus fregerat, quo ipso gravius peccaverat." This representation Ezekiel has in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/23.htm">Jeremiah 23</a> expanded into an elaborate allegory. The epithets &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1492; and &#1489;&#1468;&#1490;&#1493;&#1491;&#1492; or &#1489;&#1468;&#1490;&#1491;&#1492; (<a href="/jeremiah/3-11.htm">Jeremiah 3:11</a>) are coined into proper names. This is shown by their being set without articles before the names; as mere epithets they would stand after the substantives and have the article, since Israel and Judah as being nomm. propr. are definite ideas. &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1492; is elsewhere an abstract substantive: apostasy, defection (<a href="/jeremiah/8-5.htm">Jeremiah 8:5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/11-7.htm">Hosea 11:7</a>, etc.), here concrete, the apostate, so-called for her many &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;, <a href="/jeremiah/3-22.htm">Jeremiah 3:22</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/2-19.htm">Jeremiah 2:19</a>. &#1489;&#1468;&#1490;&#1493;&#1491;&#1492;, the faithless, used of perfidious forsaking of a husband; cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-20.htm">Jeremiah 3:20</a>, <a href="/malachi/2-14.htm">Malachi 2:14</a>. &#1492;&#1500;&#1499;&#1492; &#1492;&#1497;&#1488;, going was she, expressing continuance.
