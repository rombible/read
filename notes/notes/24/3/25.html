And forgetting the Lord our God is at the bottom of all sin. By sin we bring ourselves into trouble. The promise to those that return is, God will heal their backslidings, by his pardoning mercy, his quieting peace, and his renewing grace. They come devoting themselves to God. They come disclaiming all expectations of relief and succour from any but the Lord. Therefore they come depending upon him only. He is the Lord, and he only can save. It points out the great salvation from sin Jesus Christ wrought out for us. They come justifying God in their troubles, and judging themselves for their sins. True penitents learn to call sin shame, even the sin they have been most pleased with. True penitents learn to call sin death and ruin, and to charge upon it all they suffer. While men harden themselves in sin, contempt and misery are their portion: for he that covereth his sins shall not prosper, but he that confesseth and forsaketh them, shall find mercy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>We lie down ... - Or, We will lie down: we are ready to throw ourselves upon the ground in bitter humiliation.<p>Covereth - literally, shall cover us.

"I thought, O how I will put thee among the sons, and give thee a delightful land, a heritage of the chiefest splendour of the nations! and thought, 'My Father,' ye will cry to me, and not turn yourselves away from me. <a href="/jeremiah/3-20.htm">Jeremiah 3:20</a>. truly as a wife faithlessly forsakes her mate, so are ye become faithless towards me, house of Israel, saith Jahveh. <a href="/jeremiah/3-21.htm">Jeremiah 3:21</a>.

'Return, ye backsliding sons, I will heal your backsliding,' Behold, we come to thee; for Thou Jahveh art our God. <a href="/jeremiah/3-23.htm">Jeremiah 3:23</a>. Truly the sound from the hills, from the mountains, is become falsehood: truly in Jahveh our God is the salvation of Israel. <a href="/jeremiah/3-24.htm">Jeremiah 3:24</a>.

Let us lie down in our shame, and let our disgrace cover us; for against Jahveh our God have we sinned, we and our fathers, from our youth even unto this day, and have not listened to the voice of our God." Hitz. takes <a href="/jeremiah/3-18.htm">Jeremiah 3:18</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/3-19.htm">Jeremiah 3:19</a> together, without giving an opinion on &#1493;&#1488;&#1504;&#1499;&#1497; &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;. Ew. joins <a href="/jeremiah/3-19.htm">Jeremiah 3:19</a> to the preceding, and begins a new strophe with <a href="/jeremiah/3-21.htm">Jeremiah 3:21</a>. Neither assumption can be justified. With <a href="/jeremiah/3-18.htm">Jeremiah 3:18</a> closes the promise which formed the burden of the preceding strophe, and in <a href="/jeremiah/3-19.htm">Jeremiah 3:19</a> there begins a new train of thought, the announcement as to how Israel comes to a consciousness of sin and returns penitent to the Lord its God (<a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-21.htm">Jeremiah 3:21-25</a>). The transition to this announcement is formed by <a href="/jeremiah/3-19.htm">Jeremiah 3:19</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-20.htm">Jeremiah 3:20</a>, in which the contrast between God's fatherly designs and Israel's faithless bearing towards God is brought prominently forward; and by &#1493;&#1488;&#1504;&#1499;&#1497; &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; it is attached to the last clause of the 18th verse. His having mentioned the land into which the Israelites would again return, carries the prophet's thoughts back again to the present and the past, to the bliss which Jahveh had designed for them, forfeited by their faithless apostasy, and to be regained only by repentant return (Graf). "I thought," refers to the time when God gave the land to their fathers for an inheritance. Then spake, i.e., thought, I; cf. <a href="/psalms/31-23.htm">Psalm 31:23</a>. How I will set thee or place thee among the sons! i.e., how I will make thee glorious among the sons (&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514; c. accus. and &#1489;, as in <a href="/2_samuel/19-29.htm">2 Samuel 19:29</a>). No valid objection against this is founded by Hitz.'s plea that in that case we must read &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514;&#1498;, and that by Jeremiah, the teacher of morals, no heathen nation, or any but Israel, can ever be regarded as a son of God (<a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-9.htm">Jeremiah 31:9</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/31-20.htm">Jeremiah 31:20</a>). The fem. &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514;&#1498; is explained by the personification of Judah and Israel as two sisters, extending throughout the whole prophecy. The other objection is erroneous as to the fact. In <a href="/jeremiah/31-9.htm">Jeremiah 31:9</a> Jahveh calls Ephraim,  equals  Israel, his first-born son, as all Israel is called by God in <a href="/exodus/4-22.htm">Exodus 4:22</a>. But the conception of first-born has, as necessary correlate, that of other "sons." Inasmuch as Jahveh the God of Israel is creator of the world and of all men, all the peoples of the earth are His &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;; and from amongst all the peoples He has made choice of Israel as &#1505;&#1490;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;, or chosen him for His first-born son. Hitz.'s translation: how will I endow thee with children, is contrary to the usage of the language. - The place which God willed to give Israel amongst His children is specified by the next clause: and I willed to give thee a delightful land (&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1495;&#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1492; as in <a href="/zechariah/7-14.htm">Zechariah 7:14</a>; <a href="/psalms/106-24.htm">Psalm 106:24</a>). &#1510;&#1489;&#1497; &#1510;&#1489;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;, ornament of ornaments, i.e., the greatest, most splendid ornament. For there can be no doubt that &#1510;&#1489;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; does not come from &#1510;&#1489;&#1488;, but, with Kimchi after the Targum, is to be derived from &#1510;&#1489;&#1497;; for the plural &#1510;&#1489;&#1497;&#1497;&#1501; from &#1510;&#1489;&#1497; may pass into &#1510;&#1489;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501;, cf. Gesen. 93. 6b, as Ew., too, in 186, c, admits, though he takes our &#1510;&#1489;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; from &#1510;&#1489;&#1488;, and strains the meaning into: an heirloom-adornment amidst the hosts of heathen. After such proofs of a father's love, God expected that Israel would by a true cleaving to Him show some return of filial affection. To cry, "My father," is a token of a child's love and adherence. The Chet. &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; and &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468; are not to be impugned; the Keris are unnecessary alterations.</body></html>
