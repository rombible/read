With Jeremiah's description, comp. that of Ezekiel," The name of the city from that day shall be, "The Lord is there" (<a href="/ezekiel/48-35.htm">Ezekiel 48:35</a>). This gives us the positive aspect of the Messianic period (comp. on ver. 16). Jerusalem shall be the spiritual center of the universe, because it is pervaded by the presence of the Most High (comp. <a href="/isaiah/4-5.htm">Isaiah 4:5</a>). May we explain with Dr. Payne Smith, "Jerusalem, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the Christian Church?" Only if the provisional character of the existing Church be kept well in view. <span class="cmt_word">All the nations</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. all except the chosen people. The word for "nations" (<span class="accented">goyim</span>) <span class="accented">is</span> that often rendered "heathen." <span class="cmt_word">To the name</span>; or, <span class="accented">because of the name</span>, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. because Jehovah has revealed his name at Jerusalem. The phrase occurs again with a commentary in <a href="/joshua/9-9.htm">Joshua 9:9</a>, "Thy servants are come because of the name of Jehovah thy God, for we have heard the fame of him, and all that he did in Egypt." But we must not suppose that "name" is equivalent to "revelation;" rather, there is here an ellipsis - "because of the name" is equivalent to "because of the revelation of the <span class="accented">name</span>," or better still, "... of the <span class="accented">Name</span>." The "Name of Jehovah" <span class="accented">is</span> in fact a distinct hypostasis in the Divine Being; no mere personification of the Divine attributes (as the commentators are fond of saying), but (in the theological sense) a Person. The term, "Name of such and such a God,:' is common to Hebrew with Phoenician religion. In the famous inscription of Eshmunazar, King of Zidon, Ashtoreth is called "Name of Baal;" and to whichever proper name the religious term Name may be attached, it means a personal existence in the Divine nature, specially related to the world of humanity; or, to use the language of Hengstenberg, the bridge between the latter and the transcendent heights of God as he is in himself. In short, the Name of Jehovah is virtually identical with the Logos of St. John, or the second Person in the blessed Trinity. Hence the personal language now and again used of this Name in the Old Testament, e.g. <a href="/isaiah/30-27.htm">Isaiah 30:27</a>, "The Name of Jehovah <span class="accented">cometh</span> from far... <span class="accented">his lips</span> are full of indignation;" <a href="/isaiah/26-8.htm">Isaiah 26:8</a>," The desire of our soul was to thy Name;" <a href="/isaiah/59-19.htm">Isaiah 59:19</a>, "So shall they fear the Name of Jehovah from the west, and his glory from the rising of the sun." Comp. also <a href="/proverbs/18-10.htm">Proverbs 18:10</a>; men do not run for safety to an abstract idea. Nor will all nations in the latter days resort either to a localized or to a spiritually diffused Jerusalem in the future, to gratify a refined intellectual curiosity. <span class="cmt_word">Neither shall they walk</span>, etc.; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the Israelites of the latter days; not the "nations" before mentioned (as Hengstenberg). The phrase occurs eight times in Jeremiah, and is always used of the Israelites. The word rendered "imagination" is peculiar (<span class="accented">sheri-ruth</span>). As Hengstenberg has pointed out, it occurs <span class="accented">independently</span> only in a single passage (<a href="/deuteronomy/29-18.htm">Deuteronomy 29:18</a>); for in <a href="/psalms/81-13.htm">Psalm 81:13</a>, it is plainly derived, not from the living language, from which it had disappeared, but from the written. (The close phraseological affinity between the Books of Deuteronomy and Jeremiah has been already indicated.) The rendering of the Authorized Version, which is supported by the Septuagint, Peshito, Targum, is certainly wrong; the Vulgate has <span class="accented">pravitatum</span>; the etymological meaning is "stubbornness." The error of the versions may perhaps have arisen out of a faulty inference from <a href="/psalms/81-13.htm">Psalm 81:13</a>, where it stands in parallelism to "their counsels." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Israel's return, pardon, and blessedness. - <a href="/jeremiah/3-11.htm">Jeremiah 3:11</a>. "And Jahveh said to me, The backsliding one, Israel, is justified more than the faithless one, Judah. <a href="/jeremiah/3-12.htm">Jeremiah 3:12</a>. Go and proclaim these words towards the north, and say, Turn, thou backsliding one, Israel, saith Jahveh; I will not look darkly on you, for I am gracious, saith Jahveh; I will not always be wrathful. <a href="/jeremiah/3-13.htm">Jeremiah 3:13</a>. Only acknowledge thy guilt, for from Jahveh thy God art thou fallen away, and hither and thither hast thou wandered to strangers under every green tree, but to my voice ye have not hearkened, saith Jahveh. <a href="/jeremiah/3-14.htm">Jeremiah 3:14</a>. Return, backsliding sons, saith Jahveh; for I have wedded you to me, and will take you, one out of a city and two out of a race, and will bring you to Zion; <a href="/jeremiah/3-15.htm">Jeremiah 3:15</a>. And will give you shepherds according to my heart, and they will feed you with knowledge ad wisdom. <a href="/jeremiah/3-16.htm">Jeremiah 3:16</a>. And it comes to pass, when ye increase and are fruitful in the land, in those days, saith Jahveh, they will no more say, 'The ark of the covenant of Jahveh;' and it will no more come to mind, and ye will not longer remember it or miss it, and it shall not be made again. <a href="/jeremiah/3-17.htm">Jeremiah 3:17</a>. In that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of Jahveh; and to it all peoples shall gather themselves, because the name of Jahveh is at Jerusalem: and no longer shall they walk after the stubbornness of their evil heart. <a href="/jeremiah/3-18.htm">Jeremiah 3:18</a>. In those days shall the house of Judah go along with the house of Israel, and together out of the land of midnight shall they come into the land which I have given for an inheritance unto your fathers." In <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-11.htm">Jeremiah 3:11</a>, from the comparison of the faithless Judah with the backsliding Israel, is drawn the conclusion: Israel stands forth more righteous than Judah. The same is said in other words by <a href="/ezekiel/16-51.htm">Ezekiel 16:51</a>.; cf. (Ezek.) <a href="/jeremiah/23-11.htm">Jeremiah 23:11</a>. &#1510;&#1491;&#1511; in Piel is to show to be righteous, to justify. &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;&#1468;, her soul, i.e., herself. Israel appears more righteous than Judah, not because the apostasy and idolatry of the Israelites was less than that of the people of Judah; in this they are put on the same footing in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-6.htm">Jeremiah 3:6-10</a>; in the like fashion both have played the harlot, i.e., stained themselves with idolatry (while by a rhetorical amplification the apostasy of Judah is in <a href="/jeremiah/3-9.htm">Jeremiah 3:9</a> represented as not greater than that of Israel). But it is inasmuch as, in the first place, Judah had the warning example of Israel before its eyes, but would not be persuaded to repentance by Israel's punishment; then again, Judah had more notable pledges than the ten tribes of divine grace, especially in the temple with its divinely-ordained cultus, in the Levitical priesthood, and in its race of kings chosen by God. Hence its fall into idolatry called more loudly for punishment than did that of the ten tribes; for these, after their disruption from Judah and the Davidic dynasty, had neither a lawful cultus, lawful priests, nor a divinely-ordained kingship. If, then, in spite of these privileges, Judah sank as far into idolatry as Israel, its offence was greater and more grievous than that of the ten tribes; and it was surely yet more deserving of punishment than Israel, if it was resolved neither to be brought to reflection nor moved to repentance from its evil ways by the judgment that had fallen upon Israel, and if, on the contrary, it returned to God only outwardly and took the opus operatum of the temple-service for genuine conversion. For "the measure of guilt is proportioned to the measure of grace." Yet will not the Lord utterly cast off His people, <a href="/jeremiah/3-12.htm">Jeremiah 3:12</a>. He summons to repentance the Israelites who had now long been living in exile; and to them, the backsliding sons, who confess their sin and return to Him, He offers restoration to the full favours of the covenant and to rich blessings, and this in order to humble Judah and to provoke it to jealousy. The call to repentance which the prophet is in <a href="/jeremiah/3-12.htm">Jeremiah 3:12</a> to proclaim towards the region of midnight, concerns the ten tribes living in Assyrian exile. &#1510;&#1508;&#1504;&#1492;, towards midnight, i.e., into the northern provinces of the Assyrian empire the tribes had been carried away (<a href="/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6</a>; <a href="/2_kings/18-11.htm">2 Kings 18:11</a>). &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1492;, return, sc. to thy God. Notwithstanding that the subject which follows, &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1492;, is fem., we have the masculine form here used ad sensum, because the faithless Israel is the people of the ten tribes. &#1500;&#1488; &#1488;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500; &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;, I will not lower my countenance, is explained by <a href="/genesis/4-5.htm">Genesis 4:5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/29-24.htm">Job 29:24</a>, and means to look darkly, frowningly, as outward expression of anger; and this without our needing to take &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; for &#1499;&#1468;&#1506;&#1505;&#1497; as Kimchi does. For I am &#1495;&#1505;&#1497;&#1491;, gracious; cf. <a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6</a>. As to &#1488;&#1496;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;, see on <a href="/jeremiah/3-5.htm">Jeremiah 3:5</a>. </body></html>
