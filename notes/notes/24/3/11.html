The meaning is, that of the two, Judah was the more guilty, because, though Israel’s sins were more numerous, and their idolatry had continued longer, yet in Judah that and other sins were more heinous, because Judah had sinned against greater light, and would not take warning by that desolation which God had brought upon the whole kingdom of Israel. Observe, reader, this comparative justification stood Israel in little stead. It will little avail us to say we are not so bad as others, when yet we are not really good ourselves. And God’s judgments upon others, if they be not the means of our reformation, will help to aggravate our destruction. The Prophet Ezekiel makes the same comparison between Jerusalem and Samaria, that Jeremiah here makes between Judah and Israel, nay, and between Jerusalem and Sodom, and Jerusalem is represented as being the worst of the three.

Judah was most to blame, because that after Israel committed idolatry, and was carried captive, she took no warning by it, but fell into the same sin; and in Manasseh's time committed greater idolatries, and more wickedness, than ever Israel did; and more than even the Amorites themselves, and other Heathen nations, had done, <a href="/2_kings/21-6.htm">2 Kings 21:6</a> and though a reformation was made in Josiah's time, it was only feignedly, it was not cordial and hearty; and therefore she is all along here charged with perfidy and treachery. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the LORD said to me, The backsliding Israel hath <span class="cverse3">{n}</span> justified herself more than treacherous Judah.</span><p>(n) Israel has not declared herself as wicked as Judah, who yet has had more admonitions and examples to call her to repentance.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">11–13</span>.

In spite of Israel's apostasy, she has shown herself less worthy of punishment than Judah, who has had before her the warning lesson of Israel's example, and who has been guilty of the most hateful of all sins, hypocrisy (comp. ver. 7). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Henceforward, forsooth, it calls upon its God, and expects that His wrath will abate; but this calling on Him is but lip-service, for it goes on in its sins, amends not its life. &#1492;&#1500;&#1493;&#1488;, nonne, has usually the force of a confident assurance, introducing in the form of a question that which is held not to be in the least doubtful. &#1502;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;, henceforward, the antithesis to &#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501;, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-20.htm">Jeremiah 2:20</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-27.htm">Jeremiah 2:27</a>, is rightly referred by Chr.

Clearly we cannot suppose a reference to distress and anxiety excited by the drought; since, in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-3.htm">Jeremiah 3:3</a>, it is expressly said that this had made no impression on the people.

"Thou speakest" refers to the people's saying quoted in the first half of the verse: Will God be angry for ever? What they do is the contradiction of what they thus say. If the people wishes that God be angry no more, it must give over its evil life. &#1492;&#1512;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514;, not calamity, but misdeeds, as in <a href="/jeremiah/2-33.htm">Jeremiah 2:33</a>. &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;, thou hast managed it, properly mastered, i.e., carried it through; cf. <a href="/1_samuel/26-25.htm">1 Samuel 26:25</a>; <a href="/1_kings/22-22.htm">1 Kings 22:22</a>. The form is 2nd pers. fem., with the fem. ending dropped on account of the Vav consec. at the end of the discourse, cf. Ew. 191, b.
