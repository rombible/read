These words were proclaimed toward the north; to Israel, the ten tribes, captive in Assyria. They are directed how to return. If we confess our sins, the Lord is faithful and just to forgive them. These promises are fully to come to pass in the bringing back the Jews in after-ages. God will graciously receive those that return to him; and by his grace, he takes them out from among the rest. The ark of the covenant was not found after the captivity. The whole of that dispensation was to be done away, which took place after the multitude of believers had been greatly increased by the conversion of the Gentiles, and of the Israelites scattered among them. A happy state of the church is foretold.

Which is to be understood not of political rulers and governors, but ministers of the word; who are "pastors" or "shepherds" under Christ the great Shepherd, and are "gifts" of his to the churches, and "according to his heart"; or "conformable to his mind", as the Arabic version; whom he calls, qualifies, puts into the ministry, and sends forth; whom he holds in his right hand, and keeps as the apple of his eye; who do his will, as the Targum, and feed men according to his heart: and as this prophecy belongs to Gospel times, as appears both by what goes before and by what follows, the apostles of Christ and first ministers of the Gospel are chiefly designed; though it might have some accomplishment in Nehemiah and Ezra, Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi, at and after the Jews return from Babylon; but a more complete one in the times mentioned: so Kimchi says, these are they that shall be with the King Messiah, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/5-5.htm">Micah 5:5</a>, <p>which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding; with things worthy to be known and understood; with the solid and substantial truths of the Gospel, and by faithfully administering the ordinances of it; and in all directing to Christ the bread of life: or, "shall rule you" (f) not in an arbitrary way, according to their own ills, but according to the laws of Christ: these words, with knowledge and understanding, may either intend the matter with which these pastors should feed the church; which is what tends to spiritual knowledge and understanding, and an increase thereof; and which is blessed of God to such a purpose, though they themselves cannot give it: or else the manner in which they should feed or rule; that is, wisely and "prudently", as the Arabic version renders it: they feed wisely and prudently when they rightly divide the word of truth, and give to every one their portion of meat in due season; and feed them in proportion to their age and capacity, give milk to babes, and meat to strong men: and they rule with wisdom and prudence when they govern according to the laws of Christ, and take care that they are put in execution; and do all things decently and in order; and, as David, feed the flock according to the integrity of their hearts, and guide them by the skilfulness of their hands, <a href="/psalms/78-72.htm">Psalm 78:72</a>. <p>(f) "regent", Gataker. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And I will give you pastors according to mine heart, which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">15</span>. <span class="ital">shepherds</span>] See on ch. <a href="/jeremiah/2-8.htm" title="The priests said not, Where is the LORD? and they that handle the law knew me not: the pastors also transgressed against me, and the prophets prophesied by Baal, and walked after things that do not profit.">Jeremiah 2:8</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Pastors</span>. In <a href="/jeremiah/23-4.htm">Jeremiah 23:4</a>, the same word is rendered in the Authorized Version "shepherds," which would he less open to misunderstanding here than "pastors," civil and not spiritual authorities being intended (see on Jeremiah 2:8). The prophecy is, of course, not inconsistent with passages like <a href="/jeremiah/23-5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5</a>, but as the national continuance of Israel was guaranteed, it was natural to refer to the subordinate civil authorities. <span class="cmt_word">According to mine heart</span>; better, <span class="accented">according to my mind</span>; for here, as also in <a href="/1_samuel/13-14.htm">1 Samuel 13:14</a>, it is something very far from perfection which is ascribed to the chosen rulers.

Here &#1502;&#1511;&#1468;&#1500; &#1494;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1492;&#1468; ereH  is rather stumbling, since ob vocem scortationis cannot well be simply tantamount to ob famosam scortationem; for &#1511;&#1493;&#1500;, voice, tone, sound, din, noise, is distinct from &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; or &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;, fame, rumour. All ancient translators have taken &#1511;&#1500; from &#1511;&#1500;&#1500;, as being formed analogously to &#1506;&#1494; ,&#1514;&#1468;&#1501; ,&#1495;&#1501;; and a Masoretic note finds in the defective spelling &#1511;&#1500; an indication of the meaning levitas. Yet we occasionally find &#1511;&#1493;&#1500;, vox, written defectively, e.g., <a href="/exodus/4-8.htm">Exodus 4:8</a>; <a href="/genesis/27-22.htm">Genesis 27:22</a>; <a href="/genesis/45-16.htm">Genesis 45:16</a>. And the derivation from &#1511;&#1500;&#1500; gives no very suitable sense; neither lightness nor despisedness is a proper predicate for whoredom, by which the land is polluted; only shame or shameful would suit, as it is put by Ew. and Graf. But there is no evidence from the usage of the language that &#1511;&#1500; has the meaning of &#1511;&#1500;&#1493;&#1503;. Yet more inadmissible is the conjecture of J. D. Mich., adopted by Hitz., that of reading &#1502;&#1511;&#1468;&#1500; gnidaer fo taht, stock, for &#1502;&#1511;&#1468;&#1500;, a stock being the object of her unchastity; in support of which, reference is unfairly made to <a href="/hosea/4-12.htm">Hosea 4:12</a>. For there the matter in hand is rhabdomancy, with which the present passage has evidently nothing to do. The case standing thus, we adhere to the usual meaning of &#1511;&#1500;: for the noise or din of her whoredom, not, for her crying whoredom (de Wette). Jeremiah makes use of this epithet to point out the open riotous orgies of idolatry. &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1504;&#1507; is neither used in the active signification of desecrating, nor is it to be pointed &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1504;&#1507; (Hiph.). On the last clause cf. <a href="/jeremiah/2-27.htm">Jeremiah 2:27</a>.</body></html>
