In contrast to the words of terror, in harmony with the words of hope, he sees the almond-bough, with its bright pink blossoms and its pale green leaves, the token of an early spring rising out of the dreariness of winter. The name of the almond-tree (here the poetical, not the common, name) made the symbol yet more expressive. It was the <span class= "ital">watcher, </span>the tree that “hastens to awake” (<span class= "ital">shâkêd</span>) out of its wintry sleep, and thus expresses the divine haste which would not without cause delay the fulfilment of its gracious promise, but would, as it were, make it bud and blossom, and bear fruit.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/jeremiah/1-11.htm" title="Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying, Jeremiah, what see you?

This method of instruction or information sinks deeper into the mind, and leaves a more lasting impression there, than any mere words can do; and therefore the prophets frequently received communications from God in this way. <span class="ital">And I said, I see a rod of an almond-tree </span>— Namely, which had leaves, and possibly blossoms on it, like Aaron’s rod; otherwise the prophet could not so readily have discerned of what kind of wood it was. The almond-tree is one of the first that wakes and rises from its winter repose, flowering, in the warm southern countries, in the month of January, and by March bringing its fruits to maturity. From this circumstance, which is mentioned by Pliny, lib. 16. cap. 42, it is supposed to have received its name, <span class="greekheb">שׁקד</span>, <span class="ital">shaked, </span>as being <span class="ital">intent, </span>and, as it were, <span class="ital">on the watch </span>to seize the first opportunity of emitting its buds and blossoms: which is the proper sense of the verb, from which that noun is derived. A branch of this tree, therefore, with buds or leaves, and blossoms upon it, was a proper emblem to denote God’s <span class="ital">hastening </span>the execution of the predictions which he declared by this prophet, who lived to see most of his prophecies fulfilled. There is also in the original a remarkable <span class="ital">paranomasia, </span>or affinity in sound, between <span class="ital">shaked, </span>an <span class="ital">almond-tree, </span>and <span class="ital">shoked, hastening, </span>which makes the words more striking than they can possibly be in any translation. For not only the nature of the almond-tree, but the very sound of the Hebrew word, which signifies it, denoted God’s hastening to fulfil the prophecies which Jeremiah uttered by his directions. <span class="ital">Thou hast well seen </span>— Or, thou hast seen and judged right. Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">הישׂבת לראות</span>, <span class="ital">Thou hast done well to see, </span>that is, in seeing so. <span class="ital">For I will hasten my word </span>— Literally, <span class="ital">I will act like the almond-tree respecting my word; </span>namely, my word of threatening, against Judah and Jerusalem, <span class="ital">to perform it.</span><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:11-19 God gave Jeremiah a view of the destruction of Judah and Jerusalem by the Chaldeans. The almond-tree, which is more forward in the spring than any other, represented the speedy approach of judgments. God also showed whence the intended ruin should arise. Jeremiah saw a seething-pot boiling, representing Jerusalem and Judah in great commotion. The mouth or face of the furnace or hearth, was toward the north; from whence the fire and fuel were to come. The northern powers shall unite. The cause of these judgments was the sin of Judah. The whole counsel of God must be declared. The fear of God is the best remedy against the fear of man. Better to have all men our enemies than God our enemy; those who are sure they have God with them, need not, ought not to fear, whoever is against them.

But the rendering of the King James Version is supported by <a href="/genesis/30-37.htm">Genesis 30:37</a>. The word rendered "almond" comes from a root signifying "to be awake;" and as the almond blossoms in January, it seems to be awake while other trees are still Sleeping, and therefore is a fit emblem of activity. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. rod&#8212;shoot, or branch.<p>almond tree&#8212;literally, "the wakeful tree," because it awakes from the sleep of winter earlier than the other trees, flowering in January, and bearing fruit in March; symbol of God's early execution of His purpose; Jer 1:12, "hasten My word" (compare Am 8:3).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This and the boiling caldron, <span class="bld"><a href="/jeremiah/1-13.htm" title="And the word of the LORD came to me the second time, saying, What see you?

Dr Tristram (<span class="ital">Nat. Hist. of the Bible</span>) tells us that at Bethany in the month of January he gathered the blossoms in full bloom. They appear before the leaves open, like those of the peach-tree in England. The Hebrew used here (<span class="ital">shâkêd</span>) is not the ordinary word for an almond tree, but a poetical expression, meaning <span class="ital">that which is awakening</span>, and referring to the blossoming of this tree as taking place while others are still in their winter sleep. There is a play on the words <span class="ital">shâkêd</span> and (<span class="ital"><a href="/jeremiah/1-12.htm" title="Then said the LORD to me, You have well seen: for I will hasten my word to perform it.">Jeremiah 1:12</a></span>) <span class="ital">shôkêd</span> (watching over).

The symbol of the almond tree<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is often supposed that the almond tree and the boiling caldron were seen by the prophet in vision. But it is quite possible that it was an actual almond tree to which Jeremiah’s attention was directed. If so, we may see the prophet musing on the moral deadness and neglect which he beheld around him, as illustrated by nature’s winter sleep. It is borne in upon him, either at the very time of his call or perhaps subsequently, that in spiritual matters no less surely than in nature this state of things must cease. For him “the sight of the tree is more than a coincidence: Nature is a parable of God’s working. Hence he sees in this harbinger of the spring a sign that the hard frost is about to break and new life to spring from the soil.” (Pe. <span class="ital">ad loc</span>.)<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11-16.</span> - Two trials or probations of Jeremiah's inner sight (<a href="/2_kings/6-17.htm">2 Kings 6:17</a>). Two visions are granted him, which he is required to describe. The first expresses the certainty of his prophetic revelation; the second indicates its contents. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A rod of an almond tree</span>. The name here adopted for the almond tree is peculiarly suitable in this connection. It means "wakeful;" the almond, blossoming in January, is the first to "wake" from the sleep of winter. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Call and Consecration of Jeremiah to be a Prophet of the Lord. - The investiture of Jeremiah with the prophetic office follows in four acts: the call on the part of the Lord, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-4.htm">Jeremiah 1:4-8</a>; Jeremiah's consecration for his calling in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-9.htm">Jeremiah 1:9-10</a>; and in two signs, by means of which the Lord assures him of certain success in his work and of powerful support in the exercise of his office (<a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-11.htm">Jeremiah 1:11-19</a>). The call was given by a word of the Lord which came to him in this form: <a href="/jeremiah/1-5.htm">Jeremiah 1:5</a>. "Before I formed thee in the womb I have known thee, and before thou wentest forth from the belly have I consecrated thee, to be prophet to the nations have I set thee. <a href="/jeremiah/1-6.htm">Jeremiah 1:6</a>. Then said I, Ah, Lord Jahveh! behold, I know not how to speak; for I am too young. <a href="/jeremiah/1-7.htm">Jeremiah 1:7</a>. Then said Jahveh to me, Say not, I am too young; but to all to whom I send thee shalt thou go, and all that I command thee shalt thou speak. <a href="/jeremiah/1-8.htm">Jeremiah 1:8</a>. Fear not before them: for I am with thee, to save thee, saith Jahveh. This word came to Jeremiah by means of inspiration, and is neither the product of a reflective musing as to what his calling was to be, nor the outcome of an irresistible impulse, felt within him, to come forward as a prophet. It was a supernatural divine revelation vouchsafed to him, which raised his spiritual life to a state of ecstasy, so that he both recognised the voice of God and felt his lips touched by the hand of God (<a href="/jeremiah/1-9.htm">Jeremiah 1:9</a>). Further, he saw in spirit, one after another, two visions which God interpreted to him as confirmatory tokens of his divine commission (<a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-11.htm">Jeremiah 1:11-19</a>). Jeremiah's appointment to be a prophet for the nations follows upon a decree of God's, fixed before he was conceived or born. God in His counsel has not only foreordained our life and being, but has predetermined before our birth what is to be our calling upon this earth; and He has accordingly so influenced our origin and our growth in the womb, as to prepare us for what we are to become, and for what we are to accomplish on behalf of His kingdom. This is true of all men, but very especially of those who have been chosen by God to be the extraordinary instruments of His grace, whom He has appointed to be instruments for the carrying out of the redemptive schemes of His kingdom; cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-2.htm">Jeremiah 44:2</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/44-24.htm">Jeremiah 44:24</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/49-5.htm">Jeremiah 49:5</a>; <a href="/galatians/1-15.htm">Galatians 1:15</a>. Thus Samson was appointed to be a Nazarite from the womb, this having been revealed to his mother before he was conceived, <a href="/judges/13-3.htm">Judges 13:3</a>. To other men of God such divine predestination was made known for the first time when they were called to that office to which God had chosen them. So was it with our prophet Jeremiah. In such a case a reminder by God of the divine counsel of grace, of old time ordained and provided with means for its accomplishment, should be accepted as an encouragement willingly to take upon one the allotted calling. For the man God has chosen before his birth to a special office in His kingdom He equips with the gifts and graces needed for the exercise of his functions. The three clauses of <a href="/jeremiah/1-5.htm">Jeremiah 1:5</a> give the three moments whereof the choosing consists: God has chosen him, has consecrated him, and has installed him as prophet. The reference of the words "I have known thee," Calvin limited to the office, quasi diceret, priusquam te formarem in utero, destinavi te in hunc usum, nempe ut subires docendi munus in populo meo. Divine knowing is at the same time a singling out; and of this, choosing is the immediate consequence. But the choosing takes place by means of &#1492;&#1511;&#1491;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, sanctifying, i.e., setting apart and consecrating for a special calling, and is completed by institution to the office. "To be prophet for the nations have I set thee" (&#1504;&#1514;&#1503;, ponere, not only appoint, but install). The sense has been briefly put by Calv. thus: (Jer.) fuisse hac lege creatum hominem, ut suo tempore manifestaretur propheta. &#1500;&#1504;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501;, to the nations  equals  for the nations; not for Judah alone, but for the heathen peoples too; cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-10.htm">Jeremiah 1:10</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-9.htm">Jeremiah 25:9</a>, 46ff. The Chethibh &#1488;&#1510;&#1493;&#1512;&#1498; should apparently be read &#1488;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498;, from &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, equivalent to &#1497;&#1510;&#1512;; the root-form &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, being warranted by <a href="/exodus/32-4.htm">Exodus 32:4</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/7-15.htm">1 Kings 7:15</a>, and being often found in Aramaic. It is, however, possible that the Chet. may be only scriptio plena of &#1488;&#1510;&#1512;, a radice &#1497;&#1510;&#1512;, since the scriptio pl. is found elsewhere, e.g., <a href="/hosea/8-12.htm">Hosea 8:12</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/44-17.htm">Jeremiah 44:17</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-28.htm">Ezekiel 21:28</a>, etc. </body></html>
