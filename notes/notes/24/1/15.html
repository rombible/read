The almond-tree, which is more forward in the spring than any other, represented the speedy approach of judgments. God also showed whence the intended ruin should arise. Jeremiah saw a seething-pot boiling, representing Jerusalem and Judah in great commotion. The mouth or face of the furnace or hearth, was toward the north; from whence the fire and fuel were to come. The northern powers shall unite. The cause of these judgments was the sin of Judah. The whole counsel of God must be declared. The fear of God is the best remedy against the fear of man. Better to have all men our enemies than God our enemy; those who are sure they have God with them, need not, ought not to fear, whoever is against them.

The gate of the city, or rather a large space in its neighbourhood, was reserved free of buildings, and was the ordinary place at which trials were held and sentences declared. Cp. <a href="/deuteronomy/16-18.htm" title="Judges and officers shall you make you in all your gates, which the LORD your God gives you, throughout your tribes: and they shall judge the people with just judgment.">Deuteronomy 16:18</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/17-8.htm" title="If there arise a matter too hard for you in judgment, between blood and blood, between plea and plea, and between stroke and stroke, being matters of controversy within your gates: then shall you arise, and get you up into the place which the LORD your God shall choose;">Deuteronomy 17:8</a>; <a href="/ruth/4-1.htm" title="Then went Boaz up to the gate, and sat him down there: and, behold, the kinsman of whom Boaz spoke came by; to whom he said, Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here. And he turned aside, and sat down.">Ruth 4:1</a>. For the word throne as used to denote the judgement-seat, see <a href="/psalms/9-4.htm" title="For you have maintained my right and my cause; you sat in the throne judging right.">Psalm 9:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/122-5.htm" title="For there are set thrones of judgment, the thrones of the house of David.">Psalm 122:5</a>; <a href="/proverbs/20-8.htm" title="A king that sits in the throne of judgment scatters away all evil with his eyes.">Proverbs 20:8</a>. The general sense of the verse is that it is not without reason, or as the blind act of ambitious and more powerful nations, that Jerusalem is to be overthrown. That overthrow will take place as a judicial act, as a consequence of wickedness, and after the case had been duly weighed in the balances.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and against all the walls thereof round about, and against all the cities of Judah</span>] As the text now stands, the prophet mingles the two thoughts of a besieging army and of a judicial sentence and its execution. It is in point of fact by the scaling of the walls of Jerusalem and the capture of the other cities of the country that the sentence is to be carried out, and Jeremiah here as elsewhere (see Intr. iii. § 14 (<span class="ital">d</span>) and note) breaks off his simile or metaphor with abruptness and takes up anew the literal statement.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will call</span>; literally, <span class="accented">I am calling</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. I am about to call. <span class="cmt_word">The kingdoms of the north</span>; alluding possibly to the varied origin of the population of Assyria and Babylonia. But more probably it is simply a suggestive phrase, for the wide extent of the hostile empire referred to (comp. <a href="/jeremiah/25-9.htm">Jeremiah 25:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">They shall set every one his throne</span>, etc. The kings, or. the, generals, representing "all the families, etc., shall set up the high seat of power and judicial authority at the broad space within the gate of the city, which constituted the Oriental forum (comp. <a href="/genesis/23-10.htm">Genesis 23:10</a>; <a href="/joshua/20-4.htm">Joshua 20:4</a>; <a href="/job/29-7.htm">Job 29:7</a>; <a href="/job/31-21.htm">Job 31:21</a>). Thither the besieged would have to come to surrender themselves (<a href="/2_kings/24-12.htm">2 Kings 24:12</a>) and to hear their fate. A similar prediction is made with regard to Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="/jeremiah/43-9.htm">Jeremiah 43:9, 10</a>). It is true the seat of authority is there said to be placed at the entrance of the palace, but this was in fact another place where justice was wont to be administered (<a href="/jeremiah/22-2.htm">Jeremiah 22:2, 3</a>). Jerome's view, adopted by Rosenm&uuml;ller and Nagelsbach, that "to set one's seat" means "to besiege" is against usage, and does not accord with the opening words of ver. 16. There is, however, an element of truth in it. The judgment executed ministerially by the northern kings or generals began with the siege of Jerusalem and the other cities, and hence the words with which the prophet continues. <span class="cmt_word">And against all the walls</span>, etc. We should have expected something like "and shall set themselves in array against," etc. (comp. <a href="/isaiah/22-7.htm">Isaiah 22:7</a> b); see, however, last note. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Consecration. - <a href="/jeremiah/1-9.htm">Jeremiah 1:9</a>. "And Jahveh stretched forth His hand, and touched my mouth, and Jahveh said to me, Behold, I put my words into thy mouth. <a href="/jeremiah/1-10.htm">Jeremiah 1:10</a>. Behold, I set thee this day over the nations, and over the kingdoms, to root up and to ruin, to destroy and to demolish, to build and to plant." In order to assure him by overt act of His support, the Lord gives him a palpable pledge. He stretches out His hand and causes it to touch his mouth (cf. <a href="/isaiah/6-7.htm">Isaiah 6:7</a>); while, as explanation of this symbolical act, He adds: I have put my words in thy mouth. The hand is the instrument of making and doing; the touching of Jeremiah's mouth by the hand of God is consequently an emblematical token that God frames in his mouth what he is to speak. It is a tangible pledge of &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, inspiratio, embodiment of that influence exercised on the human spirit, by means of which the holy men of God speak, being moved by the Holy Ghost, <a href="/2_peter/1-21.htm">2 Peter 1:21</a> (N&#x3b4;gelsb.). The act is a real occurrence, taking place not indeed in the earthly, corporeal sphere, but experienced in spirit, and of the nature of ecstasy. By means of it God has consecrated him to be His prophet, and endowed him for the discharge of his duties; He may now entrust him with His commission to the peoples and kingdoms, and set him over them as His prophet who proclaims to them His word. The contents of this proclaiming are indicated in the following infinitive clauses. With the words of the Lord he is to destroy and to build up peoples and kingdoms. The word of God is a power that carries out His will, and accomplishes that whereto He sends it, <a href="/isaiah/55-10.htm">Isaiah 55:10</a>. Against this power nothing earthly can stand; it is a hammer that breaks rocks in pieces, <a href="/jeremiah/23-29.htm">Jeremiah 23:29</a>. What is here said of the word of Jahveh to be preached by Jeremiah is said of Jahveh Himself in <a href="/jeremiah/31-28.htm">Jeremiah 31:28</a>. Its power is to show itself in two ways, in destroying and in building up. The destroying is not set down as a mere preliminary, but is expressed by means of four different words, whereas the building is given only in two words, and these standing after the four; in order, doubtless, to indicate that the labours of Jeremiah should consist, in the first place and for the most part, in proclaiming judgment upon the nations. The assonant verbs &#1504;&#1514;&#1513;&#1473; and &#1504;&#1514;&#1509; are joined to heighten the sense; for the same reason &#1500;&#1492;&#1512;&#1493;&#1505; is added to &#1500;&#1492;&#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1491;, and in the antithesis &#1500;&#1504;&#1496;&#1493;&#1506; is joined with &#1500;&#1489;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;.<p>(Note: The lxx have omitted &#1500;&#1492;&#1512;&#1493;&#1505;a, and hence Hitz. infers the spuriousness of this word. But in the parallel passage, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-28.htm">Jeremiah 31:28</a>, the lxx have rendered all the four words by the one &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;; and Hitz. does not then pronounce the other three spurious.)  </body></html>
