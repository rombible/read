Jeremiah does not indeed equal Isaiah in eloquence of speech, but he seems to have been no way inferior to him in firmness of mind. <span class="ital">See, I have this day set thee over the nations </span>— Namely, to speak to them in my name, for this is all that is meant here by being <span class="ital">set over them.

He was to be a prophet, not to the Jews only, but to the neighbouring nations. He is still a prophet to the whole world, and it would be well if they would attend to these warnings. The Lord who formed us, knows for what particular services and purposes he intended us. But unless he sanctify us by his new-creating Spirit, we shall neither be fit for his holy service on earth, nor his holy happiness in heaven. It becomes us to have low thoughts of ourselves. Those who are young, should consider that they are so, and not venture beyond their powers. But though a sense of our own weakness and insufficiency should make us go humbly about our work, it should not make us draw back when God calls us. Those who have messages to deliver from God, must not fear the face of man. The Lord, by a sign, gave Jeremiah such a gift as was necessary. God's message should be delivered in his own words.

An outward symbol of the gift of eloquence, which was being then and there bestowed. The same part of the verb (with a causative force) is used in the corresponding passage of Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/6-7.htm" title="And he laid it on my mouth, and said, See, this has touched your lips; and your iniquity is taken away, and your sin purged.">Isaiah 6:7</a>). On the other hand, in Daniel (<a href="/daniel/10-16.htm" title="And, behold, one like the similitude of the sons of men touched my lips: then I opened my mouth, and spoke, and said to him that stood before me, O my lord, by the vision my sorrows are turned on me, and I have retained no strength.">Daniel 10:16</a>), where the object was merely to restore the power of articulate speech, the verb is “touched,” not “caused to touch.” The nature of God’s dealing with Ezekiel was distinct from either of these (<a href="/ezekiel/2-8.htm" title="But you, son of man, hear what I say to you; Be not you rebellious like that rebellious house: open your mouth, and eat that I give you.">Ezekiel 2:8</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">I have put, etc</span>.] Cp. <a href="/deuteronomy/18-18.htm" title="I will raise them up a Prophet from among their brothers, like to you, and will put my words in his mouth; and he shall speak to them all that I shall command him.">Deuteronomy 18:18</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Touched my mouth</span>; literally, <span class="accented">caused</span> (<span class="accented">his hand</span>) <span class="accented">to touch my mouth</span>. Jeremiah had said that he was unskilled in oratory; the Divine answer is that the words which he has to speak are not his own, but those of Jehovah. Two things are obvious: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The touching of the lips is not purely metaphorical, as in <a href="/psalms/51-15.htm">Psalm 51:15</a> (comp. <a href="/psalms/40-6.htm">Psalm 40:6</a>); it represents a real experience. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> This experience, however, can only have been a visionary one, analogous to that vouchsafed to Isaiah at the opening of his prophetic ministry. In the grand account given by Isaiah of his inaugural vision (which has evidently influenced the form of the vision of Jeremiah), we read of the same significant act on the part of one of the seraphim. It is the same act, certainly, but it symbolizes, not as here the communication of a prophetic message (comp. <a href="/matthew/10-19.htm">Matthew 10:19</a>), but the purification of the lips. Does it not seem as if Isaiah had attained a deeper insight into the spiritual regeneration needed by the prophet than had been granted to Jeremiah? Another point in which Jeremiah's account seems inferior to that of Isaiah is plastic power. Notice how Jeremiah dwells upon the meaning of the words; this is a reflective element which diminishes the poetic power of the narrative. A word may Be added to explain that "visionary" is not here used in opposition to "based on fact." That the two epithets are susceptible of combination is well shown in the vision described by Pere Gratry, in his 'Souvenirs do ma Jeunesse' (pp. 102-105), the reality of which is not in the least impaired in the writer's mind by its thoroughly inward character: "Dens teutes ces seines interieures, je n'imaginais rien... c'etaient de saisissantes et tres-energiques realites auxquelles je ne m'attendais nullement." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div><a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-1.htm">Jeremiah 1:1-3</a> contain the heading to the whole book of the prophecies of Jeremiah. The heading runs thus: "Sayings of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests at Anathoth, in the land of Benjamin, to whom befell the word of Jahveh in the days of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign, and in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, unto the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah king of Judah, until the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month." The period mentioned in these verses includes the time of Jeremiah's principal labours, while no reference is here made to the work he at a later time wrought amidst the ruins of Judah and in Egypt; this being held to be of but subordinate importance for the theocracy. Similarly, when the names of the kings under whom he laboured are given, the brief reigns of Jehoahaz and of Jehoiachin are omitted, neither reign having lasted over three months. His prophecies are called &#1491;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, words or speeches, as in <a href="/jeremiah/36-10.htm">Jeremiah 36:10</a>; so with the prophecies of Amos, <a href="/amos/1-1.htm">Amos 1:1</a>. More complete information as to the person of the prophet is given by the mention made of his father and of his extraction. The name &#1497;&#1512;&#1502;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;, "Jahveh throws," was in very common use, and is found as the name of many persons; cf. <a href="/1_chronicles/5-24.htm">1 Chronicles 5:24</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-4.htm">1 Chronicles 12:4</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-10.htm">1 Chronicles 12:10</a>, <a href="/1_chronicles/12-13.htm">1 Chronicles 12:13</a>; <a href="/2_kings/23-31.htm">2 Kings 23:31</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/35-3.htm">Jeremiah 35:3</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/10-3.htm">Nehemiah 10:3</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/12-1.htm">Nehemiah 12:1</a>. Hence we are hardly entitled to explain the name with Hengstb. by <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/15-1.htm">Exodus 15:1</a>, to the effect that whoever bore it was consecrated to the God who with almighty hand dashes to the ground all His foes, so that in his name the nature of our prophet's mission would be held to be set forth. His father Hilkiah is taken by Clem. Alex., Jerome, and some Rabbins, for the high priest of that name who is mentioned in <a href="/2_chronicles/22-4.htm">2 Chronicles 22:4</a>; but without sufficient grounds. For Hilkiah, too, is a name that often occurs; and the high priest is sure to have had his home not in Anathoth, but in Jerusalem. But Jeremiah and his father belonged to the priests who lived in Anathoth, now called Anta, a town of the priests, lying 1 1/4 hours north of Jerusalem (see on <a href="/joshua/21-18.htm">Joshua 21:18</a>), in the land, i.e., the tribal territory, of Benjamin. In <a href="/jeremiah/1-2.htm">Jeremiah 1:2</a> &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; belongs to &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;: "to whom befell (to whom came) the word of Jahveh in the days of Josiah,...in the thirteenth year of his reign." This same year is named by Jeremiah in <a href="/jeremiah/25-3.htm">Jeremiah 25:3</a> as the beginning of his prophetic labours. &#1493;&#1497;&#1492;&#1497; in <a href="/jeremiah/1-3.htm">Jeremiah 1:3</a> is the continuation of &#1492;&#1497;&#1492; in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-2.htm">Jeremiah 1:2</a>, and its subject is &#1491;&#1489;&#1512; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;: and then (further) it came (to him) in the days of Jehoiakim,...to the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah, etc. In the fifth month of the year named, the eleventh of the reign of Zedekiah, Jerusalem was reduced to ashes by Nebuzar-adan, and its inhabitants carried away to Babylon; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/52-12.htm">Jeremiah 52:12</a>., <a href="/2_kings/25-8.htm">2 Kings 25:8</a>. Shortly before, King Zedekiah, captured when in flight from the Chaldeans during the siege of Jerusalem, had been deprived of eyesight at Riblah and carried to Babylon in chains. And thus his kingship was at an end, thought the eleventh year of his reign might not be yet quite completed. </body></html>
