He is to “build up” the fallen ruins of Israel, to “plant” in the land that had been made desolate. The whole sequel of the book is a comment on these words.

He was to be a prophet, not to the Jews only, but to the neighbouring nations. He is still a prophet to the whole world, and it would be well if they would attend to these warnings. The Lord who formed us, knows for what particular services and purposes he intended us. But unless he sanctify us by his new-creating Spirit, we shall neither be fit for his holy service on earth, nor his holy happiness in heaven. It becomes us to have low thoughts of ourselves. Those who are young, should consider that they are so, and not venture beyond their powers. But though a sense of our own weakness and insufficiency should make us go humbly about our work, it should not make us draw back when God calls us. Those who have messages to deliver from God, must not fear the face of man. The Lord, by a sign, gave Jeremiah such a gift as was necessary. God's message should be delivered in his own words. Whatever wordly wise men or politicians may think, the safety of kingdoms is decided according to the purpose and word of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I have ... set thee over - literally, I have made thee Pakeed, i. e., deputy. This title is given only to these invested with high authority (e. g. <a href="/genesis/41-34.htm">Genesis 41:34</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/24-11.htm">2 Chronicles 24:11</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/20-1.htm">Jeremiah 20:1</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/29-26.htm">Jeremiah 29:26</a>). From God's side, the prophet is a mere messenger, speaking what he is told, doing what he is commanded. From man's side, he is God's vicegerent, with power "to root out, and to pull down."<p>Root out ... pull down - In the Hebrew, the verbs present an instance of the alliteration so common in the prophets, and agreeable to oriental taste. The former signifies the destruction of anything planted, the latter refers to buildings.<p>To throw down - More exactly, to tear in pieces. There are four words of destruction, and but two words of restoration, as if the message were chiefly of evil. And such was Jeremiah's message to his contemporaries. Yet are all God's dealings finally for the good of His people. The Babylonian exile was, for the moment, a time of chastisement; it also became a time of national repentance (see <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-5.htm">Jeremiah 24:5-7</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. set thee over&#8212;literally, "appointed thee to the oversight." He was to have his eye upon the nations, and to predict their destruction, or restoration, according as their conduct was bad or good. Prophets are said to do that which they foretell shall be done; for their word is God's word; and His word is His instrument whereby He doeth all things (Ge 1:3; Ps 33:6, 9). Word and deed are one thing with Him. What His prophet saith is as certain as if it were done. The prophet's own consciousness was absorbed into that of God; so closely united to God did he feel himself, that Jehovah's words and deeds are described as his. In Jer 31:28, God is said to do what Jeremiah here is represented as doing (compare Jer 18:7; 1Ki 19:17; Eze 43:3).<p>root out&#8212;(Mt 15:13).<p>pull down&#8212;change of metaphor to architecture (2Co 10:4). There is a play on the similar sounds, linthosh, linthotz, in the Hebrew for "root out &#8230; pull down."<p>build &#8230; plant&#8212;restore upon their repenting. His predictions were to be chiefly, and in the first instance, denunciatory; therefore the destruction of the nations is put first, and with a greater variety of terms than their restoration.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">I have this day set thee over the nations and over the kingdoms:</span> having now received his commission, he is directed to whom he is to go, viz. to the greatest, not only single persons, but whole nations, as the Babylonians, Persians, and Egyptians, and exhorted to greatness of mind, as being sent as an ambassador from God, to deliver his messages without flattery or cowardice; and that he might make that proud people sensible of their folly, that looked upon themselves as above reproof, he gives unto his prophet this large authority. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">To pull down, </span> i.e. to prophesy that I will pull down; which I will as certainly effect as if thou hadst done it thyself; for, according to Scripture usage, the prophets are said to do that which they foretell shall come to pass, <span class="bld"><a href="/genesis/49-7.htm" title="Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel.">Genesis 49:7</a> <a href="/ezekiel/43-3.htm" title="And it was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw, even according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city: and the visions were like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell on my face.">Ezekiel 43:3</a></span>, i.e. to pronounce destruction; hence God is said to slay them by the words of his mouth, <span class="bld"><a href="/hosea/6-5.htm" title="Therefore have I hewed them by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth: and your judgments are as the light that goes forth.">Hosea 6:5</a></span>; and so are all the following expressions to be understood. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">To build and to plant; </span> metaphors taken from architects and gardeners. Either the former words relate to the enemies of God, and the latter to his friends; or rather, to both conditionally.

The reason why God useth so many words to the same purpose seems to be, partly to show how deeply all kind of wickedness and contempt of God had taken root; which possibly may be one reason why he placeth pulling down and rooting up before building and planting, to show what a deal of rubbish there was to be removed before he could reform and repair his church and state; or rather, because the prophet was to begin with these in his prophecy, as appears by his second visions, <span class="bld"><a href="/jeremiah/1-11.htm" title="Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying, Jeremiah, what see you?

The call was given by a word of the Lord which came to him in this form: <a href="/jeremiah/1-5.htm">Jeremiah 1:5</a>. "Before I formed thee in the womb I have known thee, and before thou wentest forth from the belly have I consecrated thee, to be prophet to the nations have I set thee. <a href="/jeremiah/1-6.htm">Jeremiah 1:6</a>. Then said I, Ah, Lord Jahveh! behold, I know not how to speak; for I am too young. <a href="/jeremiah/1-7.htm">Jeremiah 1:7</a>. Then said Jahveh to me, Say not, I am too young; but to all to whom I send thee shalt thou go, and all that I command thee shalt thou speak. <a href="/jeremiah/1-8.htm">Jeremiah 1:8</a>. Fear not before them: for I am with thee, to save thee, saith Jahveh. This word came to Jeremiah by means of inspiration, and is neither the product of a reflective musing as to what his calling was to be, nor the outcome of an irresistible impulse, felt within him, to come forward as a prophet. It was a supernatural divine revelation vouchsafed to him, which raised his spiritual life to a state of ecstasy, so that he both recognised the voice of God and felt his lips touched by the hand of God (<a href="/jeremiah/1-9.htm">Jeremiah 1:9</a>). Further, he saw in spirit, one after another, two visions which God interpreted to him as confirmatory tokens of his divine commission (<a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-11.htm">Jeremiah 1:11-19</a>). Jeremiah's appointment to be a prophet for the nations follows upon a decree of God's, fixed before he was conceived or born. God in His counsel has not only foreordained our life and being, but has predetermined before our birth what is to be our calling upon this earth; and He has accordingly so influenced our origin and our growth in the womb, as to prepare us for what we are to become, and for what we are to accomplish on behalf of His kingdom. This is true of all men, but very especially of those who have been chosen by God to be the extraordinary instruments of His grace, whom He has appointed to be instruments for the carrying out of the redemptive schemes of His kingdom; cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-2.htm">Jeremiah 44:2</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/44-24.htm">Jeremiah 44:24</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/49-5.htm">Jeremiah 49:5</a>; <a href="/galatians/1-15.htm">Galatians 1:15</a>. Thus Samson was appointed to be a Nazarite from the womb, this having been revealed to his mother before he was conceived, <a href="/judges/13-3.htm">Judges 13:3</a>. To other men of God such divine predestination was made known for the first time when they were called to that office to which God had chosen them. So was it with our prophet Jeremiah. In such a case a reminder by God of the divine counsel of grace, of old time ordained and provided with means for its accomplishment, should be accepted as an encouragement willingly to take upon one the allotted calling. For the man God has chosen before his birth to a special office in His kingdom He equips with the gifts and graces needed for the exercise of his functions. The three clauses of <a href="/jeremiah/1-5.htm">Jeremiah 1:5</a> give the three moments whereof the choosing consists: God has chosen him, has consecrated him, and has installed him as prophet. The reference of the words "I have known thee," Calvin limited to the office, quasi diceret, priusquam te formarem in utero, destinavi te in hunc usum, nempe ut subires docendi munus in populo meo. Divine knowing is at the same time a singling out; and of this, choosing is the immediate consequence. But the choosing takes place by means of &#1492;&#1511;&#1491;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, sanctifying, i.e., setting apart and consecrating for a special calling, and is completed by institution to the office. "To be prophet for the nations have I set thee" (&#1504;&#1514;&#1503;, ponere, not only appoint, but install). The sense has been briefly put by Calv. thus: (Jer.) fuisse hac lege creatum hominem, ut suo tempore manifestaretur propheta. &#1500;&#1504;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501;, to the nations  equals  for the nations; not for Judah alone, but for the heathen peoples too; cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-10.htm">Jeremiah 1:10</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-9.htm">Jeremiah 25:9</a>, 46ff. The Chethibh &#1488;&#1510;&#1493;&#1512;&#1498; should apparently be read &#1488;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498;, from &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, equivalent to &#1497;&#1510;&#1512;; the root-form &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, being warranted by <a href="/exodus/32-4.htm">Exodus 32:4</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/7-15.htm">1 Kings 7:15</a>, and being often found in Aramaic. It is, however, possible that the Chet. may be only scriptio plena of &#1488;&#1510;&#1512;, a radice &#1497;&#1510;&#1512;, since the scriptio pl. is found elsewhere, e.g., <a href="/hosea/8-12.htm">Hosea 8:12</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/44-17.htm">Jeremiah 44:17</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-28.htm">Ezekiel 21:28</a>, etc. </body></html>
