The almond-tree, which is more forward in the spring than any other, represented the speedy approach of judgments. God also showed whence the intended ruin should arise. Jeremiah saw a seething-pot boiling, representing Jerusalem and Judah in great commotion. The mouth or face of the furnace or hearth, was toward the north; from whence the fire and fuel were to come. The northern powers shall unite. The cause of these judgments was the sin of Judah. The whole counsel of God must be declared. The fear of God is the best remedy against the fear of man. Better to have all men our enemies than God our enemy; those who are sure they have God with them, need not, ought not to fear, whoever is against them.

The sense is, that God would enter into judgment with this people, and pass sentence upon them, and execute it: <p>touching all their wickedness; or on account of all their sins and transgressions hereafter mentioned: <p>who have forsaken me. The Targum is, "who have forsaken my worship"; for to forsake the public worship of God, attendance on his word and ordinances, or to forsake the assembling of themselves together for such a purpose, is to forsake the Lord himself, the fountain of living waters; and this is to forsake their own mercies: <p>and have burnt incense to other gods; to the idols of the Gentile, as the Targum explains it; to Baal, to the queen of heaven, and to others: <p>and worshipped the works of their own hands: idols of gold, silver, brass, and wood, which their own hands formed and carved, and which argued great stupidity and ignorance. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And I will utter my <span class="cverse3">{p}</span> judgments against them concerning all their wickedness, who have forsaken me, and have burned incense to other gods, and worshipped the works of their own hands.</span><p>(p) I will give them charge and power to execute my vengeance against the idolaters who have forsaken me for their idols.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">16</span>. <span class="ital">I will utter my judgements against them</span>] lit., <span class="bld">I will speak my judgements with them</span>. An almost identical phrase in the Hebrew occurs again in this book, when Nebuchadnezzar at Riblah “gave judgement upon Zedekiah,” mg. “spake judgements with him” (<a href="/jeremiah/39-5.htm" title="But the Chaldeans' army pursued after them, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho: and when they had taken him, they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he gave judgment on him.">Jeremiah 39:5</a>); cp. <a href="/jeremiah/4-12.htm" title="Even a full wind from those places shall come to me: now also will I give sentence against them.">Jeremiah 4:12</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">touching all their wickedness</span>] This is defined in the three clauses that follow, (i) the forsaking of the true God, (ii) the sacrificing to other gods, (iii) the worshipping of images.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">have burned incense</span>] lit. <span class="bld">have caused sacrifices to smoke</span>. The Hebrew word does not necessarily involve the use of incense.

The expression is peculiar to Jeremiah (comp. <a href="/jeremiah/4-12.htm">Jeremiah 4:12</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/12-1.htm">Jeremiah 12:1</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/39-6.htm">Jeremiah 39:6</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/52-9.htm">Jeremiah 52:9</a>), and includes both the examination of the accused, and the judicial sentence (see <a href="/jeremiah/39-5.htm">Jeremiah 39:5</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/52-9.htm">Jeremiah 52:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">All their wickedness</span>, etc. Their "wickedness," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. their infidelity to Jehovah, showed itself in burning incense to "other gods," and bowing down to their images. "Burned incense" is, however, too narrow a sense. The root-meaning of the verb is to be fragrant, and the causative conjugations will strictly mean only "to make a sweet odor," whether by the offering of incense or by burnt offerings (comp. <a href="/jeremiah/11-12.htm">Jeremiah 11:12</a>; <a href="/2_kings/23-8.htm">2 Kings 23:8</a>, where a causative conjugation is used in the same wide sense here postulated; also <a href="/psalms/66-15.htm">Psalm 66:15</a> and <a href="/isaiah/1-13.htm">Isaiah 1:13</a>, where the word usually rendered "incense" seems rather to mean "a sweet smoke"). The prophet says, "of other gods" (not "of false gods"), out of consideration for the ignorance of his hearers, to whom Baal and Moloch really were as gods; in fact, that expressive word (cf.) which Isaiah uses ten times to express the unreality of the other so-called gods, occurs only once, and then not in quite the same sense (see <a href="/jeremiah/14-14.htm">Jeremiah 14:14</a>) in Jeremiah. But the prophet's own strict monotheism is proved by such passages as <a href="/jeremiah/2-27.htm">Jeremiah 2:27</a>a; Jeremiah 8:19b; Jeremiah 16:20. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Consecration. - <a href="/jeremiah/1-9.htm">Jeremiah 1:9</a>. "And Jahveh stretched forth His hand, and touched my mouth, and Jahveh said to me, Behold, I put my words into thy mouth. <a href="/jeremiah/1-10.htm">Jeremiah 1:10</a>. Behold, I set thee this day over the nations, and over the kingdoms, to root up and to ruin, to destroy and to demolish, to build and to plant." In order to assure him by overt act of His support, the Lord gives him a palpable pledge. He stretches out His hand and causes it to touch his mouth (cf. <a href="/isaiah/6-7.htm">Isaiah 6:7</a>); while, as explanation of this symbolical act, He adds: I have put my words in thy mouth. The hand is the instrument of making and doing; the touching of Jeremiah's mouth by the hand of God is consequently an emblematical token that God frames in his mouth what he is to speak. It is a tangible pledge of &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, inspiratio, embodiment of that influence exercised on the human spirit, by means of which the holy men of God speak, being moved by the Holy Ghost, <a href="/2_peter/1-21.htm">2 Peter 1:21</a> (N&#x3b4;gelsb.). The act is a real occurrence, taking place not indeed in the earthly, corporeal sphere, but experienced in spirit, and of the nature of ecstasy. By means of it God has consecrated him to be His prophet, and endowed him for the discharge of his duties; He may now entrust him with His commission to the peoples and kingdoms, and set him over them as His prophet who proclaims to them His word. The contents of this proclaiming are indicated in the following infinitive clauses. With the words of the Lord he is to destroy and to build up peoples and kingdoms. The word of God is a power that carries out His will, and accomplishes that whereto He sends it, <a href="/isaiah/55-10.htm">Isaiah 55:10</a>. Against this power nothing earthly can stand; it is a hammer that breaks rocks in pieces, <a href="/jeremiah/23-29.htm">Jeremiah 23:29</a>. What is here said of the word of Jahveh to be preached by Jeremiah is said of Jahveh Himself in <a href="/jeremiah/31-28.htm">Jeremiah 31:28</a>. Its power is to show itself in two ways, in destroying and in building up. The destroying is not set down as a mere preliminary, but is expressed by means of four different words, whereas the building is given only in two words, and these standing after the four; in order, doubtless, to indicate that the labours of Jeremiah should consist, in the first place and for the most part, in proclaiming judgment upon the nations. The assonant verbs &#1504;&#1514;&#1513;&#1473; and &#1504;&#1514;&#1509; are joined to heighten the sense; for the same reason &#1500;&#1492;&#1512;&#1493;&#1505; is added to &#1500;&#1492;&#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1491;, and in the antithesis &#1500;&#1504;&#1496;&#1493;&#1506; is joined with &#1500;&#1489;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;.<p>(Note: The lxx have omitted &#1500;&#1492;&#1512;&#1493;&#1505;a, and hence Hitz. infers the spuriousness of this word. But in the parallel passage, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-28.htm">Jeremiah 31:28</a>, the lxx have rendered all the four words by the one &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;; and Hitz. does not then pronounce the other three spurious.)  </body></html>
