Some, who apply it to the Edomites, understand it as spoken by way of irony, in which light they understand <a href="/isaiah/16-4.htm" title="Let my outcasts dwell with you, Moab; be you a covert to them from the face of the spoiler: for the extortionist is at an end, the spoiler ceases, the oppressors are consumed out of the land.">Isaiah 16:4</a>. “But there is nothing in the context,” says Houbigant, “which can lead to this interpretation. I rather understand it as a prophecy; nor was it any thing wonderful that the conquerors should spare the little children and widows, from whom they had nothing to fear; nor that the Edomites should forsake both the one and the other, when compelled to a precipitate flight.” Or, it is a promise that God would not wholly destroy the race of Esau, but protect and preserve a remnant of them; and that, at the time when he sent these his judgments on the proud and self-confident, and all their boasted strength was cast down, the weak and helpless should be remembered by him, the Father of mercies.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/49.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>49:7-22 The Edomites were old enemies to the Israel of God.

Thy fatherless and widows must rest their hope in God alone, as none of the adult males shall be left alive, so desperate will be the affairs of Edom. The verse also, besides this threat, implies a promise of mercy to Esau in God's good time, as there was to Moab and Ammon (Jer 49:6; Jer 48:47); the extinction of the adult males is the prominent idea (compare Jer 49:12).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/49.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The only question upon this verse is, whether, in the whole of it, it be a promise or a threatening: if it be a promise, the sense is, that though this great destruction should come upon the body of the Edomites, yet God would take care of some of their <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">fatherless children, </span> whose parents being carried into captivity, they had none to provide for them: if it be taken as an ironical threatening, it soundeth ruin to those as well as the rest, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I will</span> is as much as I will not.

Leave them with me; commit them to my care; I will provide for them; they shall have food and raiment, and want nothing to make them comfortable: to have such a friend or friends, promising such things to a man, when he is obliged to flee and leave his family, or is at the point of death, serves to make him easy; but there would be none left of the Edomites to say such kind words, or do such a friendly part. Some think they are the words of God, either spoken ironically or seriously; suggesting that they should have no children or widows to leave, all should be destroyed; or, if any left, they could not expect that he would take care of them, whom they had so provoked; or that such would be their miserable case, unless he had mercy on them, and took care of their fatherless children, there would be none to do it. Others think it respects a remnant of the Edomites that should be preserved, and be converted to Christ in Gospel times. The Targum takes them to be an address to the people of Israel, paraphrasing them thus: <p>"you, O house of Israel, your orphans shall not be left, I will sustain them, and your widows shall trust in my word:'' <p>which last clause we render, <p>let your widows trust in me; which, could they be considered as the words of God, agree well with him, who is the Father of the fatherless, and Judge of the widows, <a href="/psalms/68-5.htm">Psalm 68:5</a>; and a great encouragement to persons, in such circumstances, to place their confidence in him; and it must be right so to do. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/49.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Leave thy <span class="cverse3">{m}</span> fatherless children, I will preserve <i>them</i> alive; and let thy widows trust in me.</span><p>(m) The destruction will be so great that there will be none left to take care of the widows and the fatherless.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/49.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">11</span>.

On the ground of this arbitrary paraphrase, Hitzig would at once change &#1506;&#1502;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501; into &#1506;&#1504;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501;, without considering that the giant races of that region, to which Og the king of Bashan had also belonged (<a href="/deuteronomy/3-11.htm">Deuteronomy 3:11</a>), were not called &#1506;&#1504;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501; at all, but &#1494;&#1502;&#1494;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; by the Ammonites, and &#1488;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; by the Moabites (<a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-10.htm">Deuteronomy 2:10</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/2-20.htm">Deuteronomy 2:20</a>).)<p>&#1494;&#1489;  is viewed by some as an antithesis to what immediately precedes: "thy valley flows, sc. with the blood of the slain" (Rosenm&#1516;ller and Gesenius still view it thus); or, "it flows away," i.e., thy valley (viz., its inhabitants) is scattered, dispersed. But it is quite arbitrary to supply "with blood;" and even the other explanation - which Hitzig justifies on the ground that valley or river-bottom stands for what it contains, i.e., the inhabitants of the valley, and that the population is represented under the figure of a mass of water running, flowing away - is very far-fetched. The words cannot form an antithesis to what precedes (because the description of the confidence shown is still continued, and the antithesis does not follow till <a href="/jeremiah/49-5.htm">Jeremiah 49:5</a>), but merely a further extension of the preceding clause. We may, then, either translate, "thy valley flows, overflows," so that the words shall be subordinated to what precedes; or we may take &#1494;&#1489;, with Ewald and Graf, as a noun, in which case we must repeat the preposition &#1489;&#1468;, "the abundance of thy valley." The singular, "thy valley," means, together with the other valleys of the country, perhaps the valley of Rabbah; for Ammn lies in a broad valley along with banks of the Moiet Ammn, which has its source in a pool two hundred paces from the south-west end of the city (Burckhardt's Syria, p. 355). Regarding the vicinity, Abulfeda writes (Tabulae Syr. ed. Mich. p. 92), circumjecta regio arva sativa sunt ac terra bona et abundans. The direct address, "O rebellious daughter," used of Israel in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-22.htm">Jeremiah 31:22</a>, is here transferred to the inhabitants of Rabbah, with reference to the fact that the Ammonites, denying their descent from Lot, behaved like enemies towards Jahveh and His people. In trusting their riches, they are like the Moabites, <a href="/jeremiah/48-7.htm">Jeremiah 48:7</a>. In this confidence they said, "Who will come unto us?" i.e., attack us as enemies. Thereupon the Lord replies, "I will bring on thee fear, terror from all that is round thee," all the nations that dwell about thee (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-17.htm">Jeremiah 48:17</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/48-39.htm">Jeremiah 48:39</a>), whose distress or overthrow will put thee in terror. &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;  equals  &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493;, "every one before him" (cf. <a href="/joshua/6-5.htm">Joshua 6:5</a>; <a href="/amos/4-3.htm">Amos 4:3</a>), without looking about him, or turning round (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/46-5.htm">Jeremiah 46:5</a>), i.e., in the most precipitate flight, with no one to rally the fugitives. &#1500;&#1504;&#1468;&#1491;&#1512; is collective.</body></html>
