(The Kethib &#1504;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1491;&#1512;&#1488;&#1510;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512; is perhaps merely an error in transcription occasioned by the occurrence of the preceding &#1495;&#1510;&#1493;&#1512;). Kedar, the Kedarenes, a Bedouin nation descended from Ishmael, dwelling in tents throughout the region between Arabia Petraea and Babylonia (see on <a href="/genesis/25-13.htm">Genesis 25:13</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/27-21.htm">Ezekiel 27:21</a>), is here, no doubt, a general name for all the nomadic tribes and shepherd nations of Arabia. Hazor elsewhere occurs only as the name of various cities in Palestine (<a href="/joshua/11-1.htm">Joshua 11:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/15-23.htm">Joshua 15:23</a>, <a href="/joshua/15-25.htm">Joshua 15:25</a>; <a href="/joshua/19-23.htm">Joshua 19:23</a>; <a href="/nahum/11-33.htm">Nahum 11:33</a>), of which we need not think here, since it is Arabians who are spoken of. No locality or region of this name in Arabia is known. Jeremiah appears to have formed the name for the purpose of designating those Arabians who dwelt in &#1495;&#1510;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, "courts" or "villages," and who thus differed from the Bedouins proper, or nomads and dwellers in tents; cf. <a href="/isaiah/42-11.htm">Isaiah 42:11</a> with <a href="/genesis/25-16.htm">Genesis 25:16</a>. The settled Arabians are to this day called Hadarijeh, in contrast with Wabarijeh, who dwell in tents. "Hadar, &#1495;&#1510;&#1512;, is the settled dwelling-place, in contrast with bedu&#770;, the steppe, where the tents are pitched, sometimes here, sometimes there, and only for a time" (Delitzsch on <a href="/isaiah/42-11.htm">Isaiah 42:11</a>). "The kingdoms of Hazor" are the regions of the settled tribes, ruled by their own princes or sheiks; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/25-24.htm">Jeremiah 25:24</a>.<p>(Note: According to Mrc. v. Niebuhr, Gesch. Ass. u. Bab. p. 210, "Hazor is the modern Hajar, a region which occupies the whole north-eastern corner of the Nejed, and to which, in the wider sense, Lascha, the region on the coast, also belongs" But &#1495;&#1510;&#1493;&#1512;, from &#1495;&#1510;&#1512;, which corresponds to Arab. htsr or hdr, is fundamentally different from Arab. hjr or h&#803;jr.)<p>In the prophecy, the general designation, "children of the east," i.e., Orientals, alternates with Kedar: the former is the most common name given to the tribes living to the east of Palestine, in the wilderness: cf. <a href="/judges/6-3.htm">Judges 6:3</a>; <a href="/job/1-3.htm">Job 1:3</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/25-4.htm">Ezekiel 25:4</a>. Instead of this name, Josephus uses the designation "Arabians" (Ant. <a href="/ezekiel/25-6.htm">Ezekiel 25:6</a>. 1); later, "Nabateans" or "Kedarenes" became common. Here also (<a href="/jeremiah/49-32.htm">Jeremiah 49:32</a>) is used the special designation &#1511;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1510;&#1497; &#1508;&#1488;&#1492; cut (at) the corner (of the hair), which points to the custom, usual among several of these Bedouin tribes, of cropping the hair of the head and beard; see on <a href="/jeremiah/9-25.htm">Jeremiah 9:25</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/25-23.htm">Jeremiah 25:23</a>.<p><a href="/jeremiah/49-28.htm">Jeremiah 49:28</a><p>"Thus saith Jahveh, Arise, go up to Kedar, and destroy the children of the east. <a href="/jeremiah/49-29.htm">Jeremiah 49:29</a>. Their tents and their flocks shall they take: their curtains, and all their vessels, and their camels shall they carry away for themselves; and they shall cry over them, Fear is on every side. <a href="/jeremiah/49-30.htm">Jeremiah 49:30</a>. Flee! wander far, dwell deep, ye inhabitants of Hazor, saith Jahveh; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath taken counsel against you, and hath devised a plan against them. <a href="/jeremiah/49-31.htm">Jeremiah 49:31</a>. Arise! go up against a nation at ease, dwelling carelessly, saith Jahveh; it has no gates nor bars - they dwell alone. <a href="/jeremiah/49-32.htm">Jeremiah 49:32</a>. And their camels shall be a prey, and the multitude of their herds a spoil; and I will scatter them to every wind who have cut the corner [of their beards], and from all sides will I bring their destruction, saith Jahveh. <a href="/jeremiah/49-33.htm">Jeremiah 49:33</a>. And Hazor shall be an habitation of jackals, a desolation for ever. No man shall dwell there, nor shall a son of man sojourn in it."<p>This prophecy consists of two brief strophes, which begin with a summons to the army of the enemy to wage war on the Arabians (<a href="/jeremiah/49-28.htm">Jeremiah 49:28</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/49-31.htm">Jeremiah 49:31</a>), and then announce the execution of this order; the arrangement, moreover, is such that there is attached to the first strophe a summons to the Arabians to save themselves by flight (<a href="/jeremiah/49-30.htm">Jeremiah 49:30</a>), while the other concludes with the threat that their territory shall be destroyed (<a href="/jeremiah/49-33.htm">Jeremiah 49:33</a>).<p><a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-28.htm">Jeremiah 49:28-30</a><p>&#1506;&#1500;&#1492; is used with &#1488;&#1500; instead of &#1506;&#1500;, to signify hostile advance against a nation or city. &#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468; with Qametz-Hatuph (without Metheg) is imperative; cf. Ewald, 227, i, with 251, c. The verbs &#1497;&#1511;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468; and &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; in <a href="/jeremiah/49-29.htm">Jeremiah 49:29</a> are not jussives (Ewald, Umbreit, etc.), but imperfects, describing what takes place in consequence of the order given. Tents and flocks of sheep and goats, curtains and vessels, together with camels, form the property and wealth of the nomads. &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;, to take away, carry off; &#1500;&#1492;&#1501;, sibi. They call out over them, as if it were a watch-cry, "Horror around:" on this expression, see <a href="/jeremiah/6-25.htm">Jeremiah 6:25</a>. This justifies the call addressed to them, "Flee," etc. To &#1504;&#1505;&#1493;&#1468; is added &#1504;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468; for the purpose of intensifying, and this again is further strengthened by appending &#1502;&#1488;&#1491;: "Use every effort to flee." &#1492;&#1506;&#1502;&#1497;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468; as in <a href="/jeremiah/49-8.htm">Jeremiah 49:8</a>. A reason is given for the summons, in the statement that Nebuchadnezzar, as the instrument of Jahveh, has formed a plan against them; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/49-20.htm">Jeremiah 49:20</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/18-11.htm">Jeremiah 18:11</a>. Instead of &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;, many MSS and the ancient versions have &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501;, in conformity with the first member. In all probability, the original reading is "against them," inasmuch as "the discourse, as in other instances, makes a transition, in the last portion, from direct address to a calmer style of speaking" (Ewald).</body></html>
