He who conquered many strong cities, will not leave those unconquered that dwell in tents. He will do this to gratify his own covetousness and ambition; but God orders it for correcting an unthankful people, and for warning a careless world to expect trouble when they seem most safe. They shall flee, get far off, and dwell deep in the deserts; they shall be dispersed.

In the last clause &#1493;&#1495;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; is subsumed along with &#1510;&#1512;&#1492;; hence the verb is put in the singular. - <a href="/jeremiah/49-25.htm">Jeremiah 49:25</a>. The question, "How is not," etc., has been differently explained. Eichhorn, Gesenius, Ewald, and Umbreit take the words according to the German usage, in the sense, "How is the city forsaken?" or laid waste. But this Germanism is foreign to the Hebrew; and it is not obviated by C. B. Michaelis taking "how" in the sense of quam inopinato et quam horribiliter non deserta est, so that the words would mean nullus est modus desertionis aut gradus quem Damascus non sit experta, because &#1488;&#1497;&#1498; &#1500;&#1488; does not express the kind and manner, or the degree of an action. In the only other passage where &#1488;&#1497;&#1498; &#1500;&#1488; occurs (<a href="/2_samuel/1-14.htm">2 Samuel 1:14</a>) the negative has its full meaning. Others (Calvin, Schnurrer, J. D. Michaelis, Rosenmller, Maurer) take &#1506;&#1494;&#1489; in the sense of leaving free, untouched: "How has she not been left untouched?" i.e., been spared. But this meaning of the verb is nowhere found. There is no other course left than, with Ngelsbach, to take the verb as referring to the desertion of the city through the flight of the inhabitants, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-29.htm">Jeremiah 4:29</a>, etc., and to take the words thus: "How is (i.e., how has it happened that) the famous city (is) not forsaken?" According to this view, it is not the desolation of the city that is bewailed, but the fact that the inhabitants have not saved their lives by flight. The way is prepared for this thought by <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-24.htm">Jeremiah 49:24</a>, where it is said that the inhabitants of Damascus wish to flee, but are seized with convulsive terror; in <a href="/jeremiah/49-25.htm">Jeremiah 49:25</a> also there is a more specific reason given for it, where it is stated that the youths (the young warriors) and all the men of war shall fall in the streets of the city, and be slain by foes. The suffix in "my delight" refers to the prophet, and expresses his sympathy for the fall of the glorious city (see on <a href="/jeremiah/48-31.htm">Jeremiah 48:31</a>); because not only does its population perish, but the city itself also (<a href="/jeremiah/49-27.htm">Jeremiah 49:27</a>) is to be burned to ashes.</body></html>
