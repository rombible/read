Conquered by Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/14-47.htm" title="So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines: and wherever he turned himself, he vexed them.">1Samuel 14:47</a>), and yet more completely by David (<a href="/2_samuel/8-14.htm" title="And he put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he garrisons, and all they of Edom became David's servants.

Amaziah and Uzziah endeavoured to reassert dominion over them (<a href="/2_kings/14-7.htm" title="He slew of Edom in the valley of salt ten thousand, and took Selah by war, and called the name of it Joktheel to this day.">2Kings 14:7</a>; <a href="/2_kings/14-22.htm" title="He built Elath, and restored it to Judah, after that the king slept with his fathers.">2Kings 14:22</a>), but under Ahaz they invaded Judah (<a href="/2_chronicles/28-17.htm" title="For again the Edomites had come and smitten Judah, and carried away captives.">2Chronicles 28:17</a>), and in the reign of Zedekiah appear as an independent power seeking to ally themselves with that king against their common enemy Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="/jeremiah/27-3.htm" title="And send them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab, and to the king of the Ammonites, and to the king of Tyrus, and to the king of Zidon, by the hand of the messengers which come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah;">Jeremiah 27:3</a>). Soon, however, they allied themselves with the Chaldaeans, and were conspicuous for their triumphant exultation in the destruction of Jerusalem (<a href="/psalms/137-7.htm" title="Remember, O LORD, the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem; who said, Raze it, raze it, even to the foundation thereof.">Psalm 137:7</a>; <a href="/lamentations/4-21.htm" title="Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, that dwell in the land of Uz; the cup also shall pass through to you: you shall be drunken, and shall make yourself naked.">Lamentations 4:21</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/35-15.htm" title="As you did rejoice at the inheritance of the house of Israel, because it was desolate, so will I do to you: you shall be desolate, O mount Seir, and all Idumea, even all of it: and they shall know that I am the LORD.">Ezekiel 35:15</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/36-5.htm" title="Therefore thus said the Lord GOD; Surely in the fire of my jealousy have I spoken against the residue of the heathen, and against all Idumea, which have appointed my land into their possession with the joy of all their heart, with despiteful minds, to cast it out for a prey.">Ezekiel 36:5</a>). Obadiah had prophesied against them, probably shortly before Jeremiah’s utterance, and what we find here stands in the same relation to his language as the prophecy against Moab in Jeremiah 48 does to Isaiah 15, 16. Possibly, however, as <a href="/obadiah/1-11.htm" title="In the day that you stood on the other side, in the day that the strangers carried away captive his forces, and foreigners entered into his gates, and cast lots on Jerusalem, even you were as one of them.">Obadiah 1:11</a> seems to indicate, Obadiah was the later of the two. (See <span class= "ital">Introduction </span>to Obadiah.)<p><span class= "bld">Is wisdom</span> <span class= "bld">no more in Teman . . .?</span>—The exact locality of Teman has not been determined, but it is always closely connected with Edom, and, as the word means “south,” may describe that region of the Edomite country. Its fame for wisdom seems to have been proverbial. So Eliphaz the Temanite appears as the chief speaker among Job’s three friends (<a href="/job/2-11.htm" title="Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that was come on him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite: for they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him.">Job 2:11</a>; <a href="/job/4-1.htm" title="Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,">Job 4:1</a>). So Obadiah (<a href="/obadiah/1-8.htm" title="Shall I not in that day, said the LORD, even destroy the wise men out of Edom, and understanding out of the mount of Esau?">Obadiah 1:8</a>) speaks of the “wise men” of Edom. So Solomon’s wisdom excelled that of “the children of the East” (<a href="/1_kings/4-30.htm" title="And Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east country, and all the wisdom of Egypt.">1Kings 4:30</a>).

Although expressly reserved from attack by Moses <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-5.htm">Deuteronomy 2:5</a>, a long feud caused the Edomites to cherish so bitter an enmity against Judah, that they exulted with cruel joy over the capture of Jerusalem by the Chaldaeans, and showed great cruelty toward those why fled to them for refuge.<p>Of the prophecies against Edom the first eight verses of Obadiah are also found in Jeremiah (see the marginal references). As Jeremiah wrote before the capture of Jerusalem, and Obadiah apparently after it (see <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-13.htm">Jeremiah 49:13-14</a>), it might seem certain that Obadiah copied from Jeremiah. Others held the reverse view; while some consider that the two prophets may both have made common use of some ancient prediction.

Or, "unto Edom" (i), thus saith the Lord; or, "against Edom" (k); all which is true, as observed on <a href="/jeremiah/49-1.htm">Jeremiah 49:1</a>; meaning the Idumeans, the posterity of Esau, who was called Edom. Kimchi thinks this respects time yet future, and points at the destruction of Rome, and the Romans, who with the Jews frequently go by the name of Edom; and Abarbinel is of the same mind. And Cocceius is of opinion that the Jews are meant, and their destruction, with whom the Idumeans were incorporated before the coming of Christ, and had Herod, an Idumean, king over them; but it is best to understand the prophecy properly and literally of the Idumeans themselves; <p>is wisdom no more in Teman? a city in Edom, which had its name from Teman, a grandson of Esau, <a href="/genesis/36-11.htm">Genesis 36:11</a>; whose descendants were called Temanites; one of which was Eliphaz, a friend of Job's, <a href="/job/2-11.htm">Job 2:11</a>; it was a principal city, famous for men of wisdom; such an one was the person just mentioned: perhaps the grand senate of the country, or the chief counsellors, dwelt here; where schemes were formed for the good of the country in times of war or peace; or schools were kept here for the instruction of persons in various arts and sciences; and which had continued to this time, but now would be no more. The Targum is, <p>"is there no more wisdom in the south?'' <p>but Jarchi better interprets it of Edom, which lay south to the land of Israel; <p>is counsel perished from the prudent? it was so, even from those that were the most famous for being prudent and understanding men; they were now at their wits' end, and knew not what course to take, nor what advice to give, in this their time of distress. The Targum renders it "from the children"; the sons of the Temanites, strangely degenerated from their ancestors; <p>is their wisdom vanished? or corrupted, as the Targum; or does it stink? according to the Rabbinical sense of the word; or infatuated, and become good for nothing? verily it was, it was useless, disregarded and despised. <p>(i) "ad Idumeam", V.

The two main views are as follows: (<span class="ital">a</span>) that both are based on an older prophecy, Ob. preserving a more original form (so Dr., G. A.

Ob., as it stands, is evidently (see <span class="ital"><a href="/jeremiah/49-10.htm" title="But I have made Esau bore, I have uncovered his secret places, and he shall not be able to hide himself: his seed is spoiled, and his brothers, and his neighbors, and he is not.">Jeremiah 49:10</a></span> ff.) subsequent to the fall of Jerusalem (b.c. 586). From what we have said above, it follows that the corresponding parts of this section are later, either as an addition to a genuine Jeremianic utterance of the fourth year of Jehoiakim (see introd. note on chs. 46–51), or as forming a part of the section which is wholly post-exilic; the former of these two hypotheses being on the whole preferable. Co. points out the skill with which (on the former hypothesis) the incorporator of the Ob. passages avoided all references (so <a href="/obadiah/1-10.htm" title="For your violence against your brother Jacob shame shall cover you, and you shall be cut off for ever.">Obadiah 1:10</a> ff.) to the overthrow of Jerusalem. The expansion in later times of a Jeremianic prophecy against Edom is <span class="ital">a priori</span> likely for reasons similar to those mentioned in introd. note to <a href="/context/jeremiah/48-1.htm" title="Against Moab thus said the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Woe to Nebo! for it is spoiled: Kiriathaim is confounded and taken: Misgab is confounded and dismayed....">Jeremiah 48:1-10</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The bitterness of the tone in which Edom is addressed finds parallels in <a href="/lamentations/4-21.htm" title="Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, that dwell in the land of Uz; the cup also shall pass through to you: you shall be drunken, and shall make yourself naked.">Lamentations 4:21</a>, as also in <a href="/psalms/137-7.htm" title="Remember, O LORD, the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem; who said, Raze it, raze it, even to the foundation thereof.">Psalm 137:7</a>; <a href="/context/ezekiel/25-12.htm" title="Thus said the Lord GOD; Because that Edom has dealt against the house of Judah by taking vengeance, and has greatly offended, and revenged himself on them;...">Ezekiel 25:12-14</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/35-15.htm" title="As you did rejoice at the inheritance of the house of Israel, because it was desolate, so will I do to you: you shall be desolate, O mount Seir, and all Idumea, even all of it: and they shall know that I am the LORD.">Ezekiel 35:15</a>; <a href="/context/obadiah/1-10.htm" title="For your violence against your brother Jacob shame shall cover you, and you shall be cut off for ever....">Obadiah 1:10-16</a>, and is no doubt based upon a sense of the closeness of the tie of kinship between Edom and Israel.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The contents of the section may be summarized as follows.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(i) <span class="ital"><a href="/context/jeremiah/49-7.htm" title="Concerning Edom, thus said the LORD of hosts; Is wisdom no more in Teman? is counsel perished from the prudent? is their wisdom vanished?...">Jeremiah 49:7-12</a></span>. Have the prudent of Teman lost their wisdom? Flee into hiding from coming troubles, ye people of Dedan. Ye shall be utterly despoiled. Leave to Jehovah the charge of your widows and orphans. Ye shall yourselves assuredly drink the wine of destruction. (ii) <span class="ital"><a href="/context/jeremiah/49-13.htm" title="For I have sworn by myself, said the LORD, that Bozrah shall become a desolation, a reproach, a waste, and a curse; and all the cities thereof shall be perpetual wastes....">Jeremiah 49:13-22</a></span>. Bozrah and the other cities shall be laid waste. The nations are summoned to fight against her. She shall be held in contempt, though erst so proud. She shall be brought down from her loftiness and jeered at, overthrown and without inhabitant as were Sodom and Gomorrah. The foe as a lion shall drive her away. Such is Jehovah’s purpose. The far-reaching sound of her fall shall make the earth to tremble. At the swoop of the enemy the anguish of Edom shall be great.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The affinity which existed between the two nations made the unnatural exultation of Edom over the fallen fortunes of the Jews most offensive. See, in addition to the above passages, <a href="/amos/1-11.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; For three transgressions of Edom, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because he did pursue his brother with the sword, and did cast off all pity, and his anger did tear perpetually, and he kept his wrath for ever:">Amos 1:11</a>, and for an apparent reference to the fulfilment of this prophecy against Edom, <a href="/malachi/1-3.htm" title="And I hated Esau, and laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness.">Malachi 1:3</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/49.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7-10.</span> - A startling picture of the judgment impending over Edom, the severity of which is to be inferred from the behaviour of the sufferers. Observe, no allusion is made by Jeremiah to any special bitter feeling of the Edomites towards the Israelites, such as is implied in <a href="/isaiah/34.htm">Isaiah 34</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/35.htm">Ezekiel 35</a>, and other passages. With regard to the fulfilment of the prophecy, we may fairly quote in the first place <a href="/malachi/1-2.htm">Malachi 1:2-4</a>. The agents in the desolation there referred to (still fresh in Malachi's recollection) are probably the Nabathaeans (an Arab race, though writing Aramaic), who, after occupying Edom, dropped their nomad habits, devoted themselves to commerce, and founded the kingdom of Arabia Petraea. Meantime the Edomites maintained an independent existence in the midst of the Jewish colonists, till John Hyrcanus compelled them to accept circumcision about  <span class="date">B.C. 130</span>. In spite of this enforced religious and political union, the Edomites remained perfectly conscious of their nationality, and we find them mentioned as a distinct factor in the community in Josephus' account of the great Jewish war. They pass away from history after the destruction of Jerusalem, A.D. 70. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Teman</span> was celebrated for its "wisdom," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> for a practical moral philosophy, similar to that which we find in the less distinctly religions portions of the Book of Proverbs. It was this "wisdom" which formed the common element in the higher culture of the Semitic peoples, and of which the sacred narrator speaks when he says that "Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east country" (<a href="/1_kings/4-30.htm">1 Kings 4:30</a>). One of Job's friends, Eliphaz, was a Temanite (<a href="/job/2-11.htm">Job 2:11</a>). From ver. 20, however, it appears that Teman is here used for Edom in general, of which it formed a part. "Wisdom" was doubtless cultivated throughout Idumaea (<a href="/obadiah/1-8.htm">Obadiah 1:8</a>), the "land of Uz," in which Job dwelt, was probably in the east of Edom (see on Jeremiah 25:20). <span class="cmt_word">Is their wisdom vanished?</span> The Hebrew, with its characteristic love for material symbols, has, "Is their wisdom poured out?" So in <a href="/jeremiah/19-7.htm">Jeremiah 19:7</a>, "I will pour out [a different word, however, is used] the counsel of Judah." The body being regarded as a vessel, it was natural to represent the principle of life, both physical (<a href="/isaiah/53-12.htm">Isaiah 53:12</a>) and intellectual (as here), under the symbol of a liquid. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/49.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Concerning the children of Ammon, thus saith Jahveh: Hath Israel no sons, or hath he no heir? Why doth their king inherit Gad, and his people dwell in his cities? <a href="/jeremiah/49-2.htm">Jeremiah 49:2</a>. Therefore, behold, days are coming, saith Jahveh, when I will cause to be heard against Rabbah of the children of Ammon a war-cry; and it shall become a heap of ruins, and her daughters shall be burned with fire: and Israel shall heir those who heired him, saith Jahveh. <a href="/jeremiah/49-3.htm">Jeremiah 49:3</a>.

But afterwards I will turn the captivity of the children of Ammon, saith Jahveh."<p>The address begins with a question full of reproach: "Has Israel, then, no sons who could take possession of his land as their inheritance, that the king of the Ammonites has taken possession of Gad (i.e., of the hereditary portion of the tribe of Gad), and dwells in the cities of Gad?" The question presupposes that the Israelites had been carried away by Tiglath-pileser, but at the same time, also, that the country still belongs to the Gadites, for they certainly have sons who shall again receive the inheritance of their fathers. Since Jeremiah, as is clear from <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-3.htm">Jeremiah 49:3</a>, had <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/1-13.htm">Amos 1:13-15</a> in his mind, he evidently uses &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1501; in a double sense, not merely in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-3.htm">Jeremiah 49:3</a>, but even in <a href="/jeremiah/49-1.htm">Jeremiah 49:1</a> also, with a reference to <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/1-15.htm">Amos 1:15</a>, meaning the king and god of the Ammonites. As in Amos, Aquila, Symmachus, Jerome, and the Syriac, so in this passage also, the lxx, Vulgate, and Syriac have understood &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1501; of the god &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1501;; with them agree Ewald, Hitzig, and Graf. But the reasons alleged for the change of &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1501; into &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1501; are quite as insufficient here as in <a href="/amos/1-15.htm">Amos 1:15</a>. Just as, in the last-named passage, &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1501; first of all refers to the king of the Ammonites, so is it here. It is not the god, but the king, of the Ammonites that has taken possession of the territory of Gad. It is not till <a href="/jeremiah/49-3.htm">Jeremiah 49:3</a> that the reference to the god Milcom plainly comes out. <a href="/jeremiah/49-2.htm">Jeremiah 49:2</a>. Therefore shall Rabbah, the capital of the Ammonites, hear the cry of war, and be changed into a heap of ruins. &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1514; &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; , "The great (city) of the sons of Ammon," is the full name of the Ammonite capital (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/3-11.htm">Deuteronomy 3:11</a>), which is usually called, briefly, &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492; (<a href="/amos/1-14.htm">Amos 1:14</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-1.htm">2 Samuel 11:1</a>, etc.); it was afterwards called Philadelphia, probably after Ptolemy Philadelphus, in Polybius'  &#788;&#x3a1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;, in Abulfeda Amn, which is the name still given to its ruins on the Nahr Ammn, i.e., the Upper Jabbok; see on <a href="/deuteronomy/3-11.htm">Deuteronomy 3:11</a>. "A cry of war," as in <a href="/jeremiah/4-19.htm">Jeremiah 4:19</a>; cf. <a href="/amos/1-14.htm">Amos 1:14</a>. "A will of desolation," i.e., a heap of ruins; cf. <a href="/joshua/8-28.htm">Joshua 8:28</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/13-17.htm">Deuteronomy 13:17</a>. "her daughters" are the smaller cities dependent on the capital, - here, all the remaining cities of the Ammonites; cf. <a href="/numbers/21-25.htm">Numbers 21:25</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/15-45.htm">Joshua 15:45</a>, etc. "Israel shall heir those who heired him," i.e., receive back the property of those who have appropriated his land.</body></html>
