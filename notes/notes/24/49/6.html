(1 Maccabees 5:6) <p>Justin Martyr (f) says, that in his time there was a large multitude of Ammonites; but Origen (g), who was later than he, observes, that not only the Idumeans, but the Ammonites and Moabites, were then called by the common name of Arabians; and these are now the present inhabitants of their country; and when these shall be converted in the latter day; see <a href="/isaiah/60-6.htm">Isaiah 60:6</a>; who may be called by the name of the ancient inhabitants; then will this be more fully accomplished: for some refer this to the days of the Messiah, and to the conversion of some of these Heathen people, either in the first times of the Gospel, or in the latter day; See Gill on <a href="/jeremiah/49-2.htm">Jeremiah 49:2</a>.

At the end of the days, i.e., in the Messianic times (see on <a href="/jeremiah/23-20.htm">Jeremiah 23:20</a>), there is in store for them a turn in their fortunes, or a restoration. For &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;, see on <a href="/jeremiah/29-14.htm">Jeremiah 29:14</a>. Cf. the similar promise for Egypt, <a href="/jeremiah/46-26.htm">Jeremiah 46:26</a>; Ammon and Elam, <a href="/jeremiah/49-6.htm">Jeremiah 49:6</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/49-39.htm">Jeremiah 49:39</a>. The last clause, "Thus far," etc., is an addition made by the editor, when this oracle was received into the collection of Jeremiah's prophecies; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/51-64.htm">Jeremiah 51:64</a>. &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496; means the prophecy regarding Moab with respect to its contents.<p>As to the fulfilment of the threatened ruin, Josephus (Antt. x. 9. 7) states that Nebuchadnezzar, in the fifth year after the destruction of Jerusalem, made war on the Moabites and subdued them. This statement is not to be questioned, though the date given should be incorrect. We have no other sources of information regarding this people. After the return of the Israelites from Babylon, the Moabites are no longer mentioned as a people, except in <a href="/ezra/9-1.htm">Ezra 9:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-1.htm">Nehemiah 13:1</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-23.htm">Nehemiah 13:23</a>, where it is stated that some Israelites had married Moabitish wives; nor is any mention made of this people in the books of the Maccabees, which, however, relate the wars of Judas Maccabeus with the Ammonites and Edomites (1 Macc. 5:3 and 6, cf. 4:61); neither is there any further notice taken of them in Josephus, who only now and then speaks of Moab, i.e., the country and its towns (Antt. xiii. 14. 2, 15. 4; Bell. <a href="//biblehub.com/jude/3.htm">Jude 3</a>.3. 3, iv. 8. 2). This name seems to have been merged, after the exile, in that of the Arabians. But the disappearance of the name of this people does not exclude the probability that descendants continued to exist, who, when Christianity spread in the country to the east of the Jordan, were received into the communion of the Christian church. </body></html>
