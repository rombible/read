For, as Josephus (c) says, the country both of the Moabites and Ammonites were in the valley of Syria, or Coelesyria; that is, hollow Syria, so called from its lying low, or in a valley; for this country lay between the mountains Libanus and Antilibanus, as Strabo (d) says, and brought forth a large increase; in this they gloried, in the produce of these valleys, in the grass, corn, and vines, that grew upon them, and the flocks that fed there; but now should have no occasion to glory, all being swept away by the enemy: <p>thy flowing valley, or, "thy valley flows" (e); is overflowed with water, through abundance of rain, which destroyed the fruits of it, so Jarchi; or rather flowed with the blood of the slain, as Kimchi, Ben Melech, and Abarbinel; the enemy having entered it, and made so great a slaughter of men in it: <p>O backsliding daughter? the Targum is, O foolish kingdom; the whole kingdom of Ammon is meant, or the people of it; who, descending from righteous Lot, may be called backsliders; and, being also idolaters, have this character; for such revolt from the true God, to worship idols: it may be rendered, "refractory", "rebellious" (f); as all such persons are: <p>that trusteth in her treasures, saying, who shall come unto me? dwelling in valleys encompassed with mountains, and in fortified cities, and abounding in wealth and riches, whereby they were able to procure men and arms to defend themselves; thought they were safe from any enemy, and that none could come nigh them, and so dwelt at ease, and in great security. <p>(c) Ibid.

"Under the shadow of Heshbon stand fugitives, powerless; for a fire goes out from Heshbon, and a flame from Sihon, and devours the region of Moab, and the crown of the head of the sons of tumult. <a href="/jeremiah/48-46.htm">Jeremiah 48:46</a>. Woe unto thee, Moab! the people of Chemosh are perished! for thy sons are taken away into captivity, and thy daughters into captivity. <a href="/jeremiah/48-47.htm">Jeremiah 48:47</a>. Yet will I turn the captivity of Moab at the end of the days, saith Jahveh. Thus far is the judgment of Moab."<p>From Heshbon issued the resolution to annihilate Moab (<a href="/jeremiah/48-2.htm">Jeremiah 48:2</a>); to Heshbon the prophecy finally returns. "In the shadow of Heshbon stand fugitives, powerless' (&#1502;&#1499;&#1468;&#1495;, with &#1502;&#1503; privative), where, no doubt, they were seeking refuge; cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/30-2.htm">Isaiah 30:2-3</a>. The fugitives can only be Moabites. Here it is astonishing that they seek refuge in Heshbon, since the enemy comes from the north, and according to <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-2.htm">Jeremiah 48:2</a>, it is in Heshbon that the resolution to destroy Moab was formed; and judging from <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-3.htm">Jeremiah 49:3</a>, that city was then in the hands of the Ammonites. Hence Hitzig and Graf miss the connection. Hitzig thinks that the whole clause was inserted by a glosser, who imagined the town belonged to Moab, perhaps allowing himself to be misled in this by <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/21-27.htm">Numbers 21:27</a>, "Come to Heshbon." Graf, on the other hand, is of opinion that the fugitives are seeking the protection of the Ammonites in Heshbon, but do not find it: hence he would take the &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; which follows in the adversative sense of "however" or "rather;" but this is against the use of the word, and cannot be allowed. The tenor of the words, "Fugitives stand under the shadow of Heshbon," does not require us to assume that people had fled to Heshbon out of the whole of Moab. Let us rather think of fugitives from the environs of Heshbon, who seek refuge in this fortified town, from the enemy advancing from the north, but who find themselves disappointed in their expectation, because from this city there bursts forth the fire of war which destroys Moab. The thought merely serves the purpose of attaching to it the utterances which follow regarding Moab; but from <a href="/jeremiah/48-43.htm">Jeremiah 48:43</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/48-44.htm">Jeremiah 48:44</a> alone, it is evident that escape will be impossible. In proof of this he mentions the flight to Heshbon, that he may have an opportunity of introducing a portion of the old triumphal songs of the Mosaic age, with which he wished to conclude his prophecy, <a href="/jeremiah/48-45.htm">Jeremiah 48:45</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/48-46.htm">Jeremiah 48:46</a>. The fugitives stand powerless, i.e., exhausted and unable to flee any further, while Heshbon affords them no refuge. For there bursts forth from it the fire that is to destroy the whole of Moab. The words from "for a fire," etc., on to the end of <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-46.htm">Jeremiah 48:46</a>, are a free imitation of some strophes out of an ancient song, in which poets of the Mosaic period celebrated the victory of Israel over Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had conquered the greater portion of Moab; but with this here is interwoven a passage from the utterances of Balaam the seer, regarding the fall of Moab, found in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/24-17.htm">Numbers 24:17</a>, viz., from &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1499;&#1500; to &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1503;. These insertions are made for the purpose of showing that, through this judgment which is now coming upon Moab, not only those ancient sayings, but also the prophecy of Balaam, will find their full accomplishment. Just as in the time of Moses, so now also there again proceeds from Heshbon the fire of war which will consume Moab. The words, "for a fire has gone out from Heshbon," are a verbatim repetition of what we find in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/21-28.htm">Numbers 21:28</a>, with the single exception that &#1488;&#1513;&#1473; is here, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/104-4.htm">Psalm 104:4</a>, construed as masculine, and thus takes &#1497;&#1510;&#1488; instead of &#1497;&#1510;&#1488;&#1492;; but this change, of course, does not affect the meaning of the words. The next clause runs, in Numbers, l.c., &#1500;&#1492;&#1489;&#1492; &#1502;&#1511;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; &#1505;&#1497;&#1495;&#1493;&#1503;, but here &#1493;&#1500;&#1492;&#1489;&#1492; &#1502;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503;; this change into &#1502;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503; is difficult to account for, so that J. D. Michaelis and Ewald would alter it into &#1502;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;.<p>There is no need for refuting the assumption of Raschi and Ngelsbach, that Sihon stands for the city of Sihon; or the fancy of Morus and Hitzig, that an old glosser imagined Sihon was a town instead of a king. When we consider that the burning of Heshbon by the Israelites, celebrated in that ancient song, was brought on by Sihon the Amorite king, since the Israelites were not to make war on Moab, and only fought against Sihon, who had made Heshbon his residence, there can be no doubt that Jeremiah purposely changed &#1502;&#1511;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; into &#1502;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503; &#1505;&#1497;&#1495;&#1493;&#1503;, in order to show that Sihon was the originator of the fire which consumed Heshbon. By this latter expression Jeremiah seeks to intimate that, in Nebuchadnezzar and the Chaldean army, there will arise against the Moabites another Sihon, from whose legions will burst forth the flame that is to consume Moab. &#1502;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503;, "from between," is to be explained on the ground that Sion is not viewed as a single individual, but as the leader of martial hosts. This fire will "devour the region of Moab, and the crown of the head of the sons of tumult." These words have been taken by Jeremiah from Balaam's utterance regarding Moab, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/24-17.htm">Numbers 24:17</a>, and embodied in his address after some transformation. What Balaam announces regarding the ruler (Star and Sceptre) that is to arise out of Israel, viz., "he shall smite the region of Moab, and dash in pieces the sons of tumult," Jeremiah has transferred to the fire: accordingly, he has changed &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1495;&#1509; into  &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1499;&#1500;, and &#1493;&#1511;&#1512;&#1511;&#1512;  into &#1493;&#1511;&#1491;&#1511;&#1491;. Several commentators understand &#1508;&#1488;&#1492; as signifying the margin of the beard (<a href="/leviticus/19-27.htm">Leviticus 19:27</a>; <a href="/leviticus/21-5.htm">Leviticus 21:5</a>); but the mention of the crown of the head in the parallel member does not require this meaning, for &#1508;&#1488;&#1492; does not signify the corner of the beard, except when found in combination with &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; or &#1494;&#1511;&#1503;. The singeing of the margin of the beard seems, in connection with the burning of the crown, too paltry and insignificant. As in the fundamental passage  &#1508;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514;&#1497; signify the sides of Moab, so here &#1508;&#1488;&#1492; is the side of the body, and &#1511;&#1491;&#1511;&#1491; the head. &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1503;, homines tumultuosi, are the Moabites with their imperious disposition; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/48-29.htm">Jeremiah 48:29</a>.</body></html>
