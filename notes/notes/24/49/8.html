But afterwards I will turn the captivity of the children of Ammon, saith Jahveh."<p>The address begins with a question full of reproach: "Has Israel, then, no sons who could take possession of his land as their inheritance, that the king of the Ammonites has taken possession of Gad (i.e., of the hereditary portion of the tribe of Gad), and dwells in the cities of Gad?" The question presupposes that the Israelites had been carried away by Tiglath-pileser, but at the same time, also, that the country still belongs to the Gadites, for they certainly have sons who shall again receive the inheritance of their fathers. Since Jeremiah, as is clear from <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-3.htm">Jeremiah 49:3</a>, had <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/1-13.htm">Amos 1:13-15</a> in his mind, he evidently uses &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1501; in a double sense, not merely in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-3.htm">Jeremiah 49:3</a>, but even in <a href="/jeremiah/49-1.htm">Jeremiah 49:1</a> also, with a reference to <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/1-15.htm">Amos 1:15</a>, meaning the king and god of the Ammonites. As in Amos, Aquila, Symmachus, Jerome, and the Syriac, so in this passage also, the lxx, Vulgate, and Syriac have understood &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1501; of the god &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1501;; with them agree Ewald, Hitzig, and Graf. But the reasons alleged for the change of &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1501; into &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1501; are quite as insufficient here as in <a href="/amos/1-15.htm">Amos 1:15</a>. Just as, in the last-named passage, &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1501; first of all refers to the king of the Ammonites, so is it here. It is not the god, but the king, of the Ammonites that has taken possession of the territory of Gad. It is not till <a href="/jeremiah/49-3.htm">Jeremiah 49:3</a> that the reference to the god Milcom plainly comes out. <a href="/jeremiah/49-2.htm">Jeremiah 49:2</a>. Therefore shall Rabbah, the capital of the Ammonites, hear the cry of war, and be changed into a heap of ruins. &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1514; &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; , "The great (city) of the sons of Ammon," is the full name of the Ammonite capital (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/3-11.htm">Deuteronomy 3:11</a>), which is usually called, briefly, &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492; (<a href="/amos/1-14.htm">Amos 1:14</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-1.htm">2 Samuel 11:1</a>, etc.); it was afterwards called Philadelphia, probably after Ptolemy Philadelphus, in Polybius'  &#788;&#x3a1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;, in Abulfeda Amn, which is the name still given to its ruins on the Nahr Ammn, i.e., the Upper Jabbok; see on <a href="/deuteronomy/3-11.htm">Deuteronomy 3:11</a>. "A cry of war," as in <a href="/jeremiah/4-19.htm">Jeremiah 4:19</a>; cf. <a href="/amos/1-14.htm">Amos 1:14</a>. "A will of desolation," i.e., a heap of ruins; cf. <a href="/joshua/8-28.htm">Joshua 8:28</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/13-17.htm">Deuteronomy 13:17</a>. "her daughters" are the smaller cities dependent on the capital, - here, all the remaining cities of the Ammonites; cf. <a href="/numbers/21-25.htm">Numbers 21:25</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/15-45.htm">Joshua 15:45</a>, etc. "Israel shall heir those who heired him," i.e., receive back the property of those who have appropriated his land.</body></html>
