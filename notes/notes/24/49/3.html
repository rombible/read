In <a href="/isaiah/15-4.htm">Isaiah 15:4</a> and Isaiah 16:9 it is reckoned to the Moabites. There was a continual warfare between the neigh-bouring tribes of Reuben and Gad on the one hand, and the Moabites and Ammonites on the other. Let Heshbon lament, because <span class="cmt_word">Ai is spoiled</span>. The introduction of At, which is only known to us as a Canaanitish town, near Bethel, on the wrong side of the Jordan for Moab, is startling. It is replied that we have no list of the Ammonitish cities, and that there may have been another town named At. The reply is valid; but loaves a second difficulty untouched, viz. that the mention of a third place destroys the continuity of thought. First, we are made acquainted with the fall of Rabbah; then Heshbon (probably the second place in the country) is called upon to wail because <span class="accented">x</span> has been taken by storm; then the populations of the "daughter" cities are summoned to join in the lamentation over Rabbah; - is it not reasonable to conclude that the subject of the mourning is one and the same? Now, it is well known that the received text abounds in small errors arising from the confusion of similar Hebrew letters, and that among the letters most easily confounded are <span class="accented">yod</span> and <span class="accented">resh.</span> Is it not an obvious conclusion that for Ai we should rather read Ar ("the city"), a name as suitable for the capital of Ammon as for that of Moab? It is true that we have no example elsewhere of Rabbah being called by the name of Ar; but in <a href="/2_samuel/10-3.htm">2 Samuel 10:3, 14</a> it is described as "the city," and we have to be on our guard against the argument <span class="accented">a silentio</span> - that favourite weapon of destructive  criticism!

It is simpler to take both forms as perfects: "they howl...Moab turns the back, is ashamed" ( equals  for shame). On &#1492;&#1497;&#1492; &#1500;&#1513;&#1474;&#1495;&#1511;, cf. <a href="/jeremiah/48-26.htm">Jeremiah 48:26</a>. &#1502;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;, object of terror, as in <a href="/jeremiah/17-17.htm">Jeremiah 17:17</a>. "All who are round about him," as in <a href="/jeremiah/48-17.htm">Jeremiah 48:17</a>. "For (<a href="/jeremiah/48-40.htm">Jeremiah 48:40</a>) the enemy rushes down upon Moab like an eagle, and seizes Kerioth and all his strongholds." The subject is left unnamed, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-18.htm">Jeremiah 46:18</a>, but it is Nebuchadnezzar. The figure of the eagle, darting down in flight on its prey, is founded on <a href="/deuteronomy/28-49.htm">Deuteronomy 28:49</a> (on &#1488;&#1500;- for &#1506;&#1500;, cf. <a href="/jeremiah/49-22.htm">Jeremiah 49:22</a>). Kerioth, the capital, is taken (see on <a href="/jeremiah/48-24.htm">Jeremiah 48:24</a>); so are the other strongholds or fastnesses of the country. The mere fact that &#1511;&#1512;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; has the article does not justify any one in taking it as an appellative, "the cities;" this appears from a comparison of <a href="/amos/2-2.htm">Amos 2:2</a> with this verse. No plural of &#1511;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492; occurs anywhere. Then the fear of death falls on the heroes of Moab like a woman in labour. &#1502;&#1510;&#1512;&#1492;, partic. Hiphil from &#1510;&#1512;&#1512;, uterum comprimens, is found only here and in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-22.htm">Jeremiah 49:22</a>, where the figure is repeated. Moab is annihilated, so that it is no longer a nation (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/48-2.htm">Jeremiah 48:2</a>), because it has risen up in pride against the God of Israel; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/48-26.htm">Jeremiah 48:26</a>. He who flees from one danger falls into the other. The play on the words &#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1491;, fear, horror, &#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;, pit, and &#1508;&#1468;&#1495;, spring-trap, as well as the mode in which it is carried out, is taken from <a href="/isaiah/24-17.htm">Isaiah 24:17</a>., - a prophecy of the judgment on the world; see a similar idea presented in <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/5-19.htm">Amos 5:19</a>, but somewhat differently expressed. The Kethib &#1492;&#1504;&#1497;&#1505;, perfect Hiphil, "he flees," is less suitable than the Qeri &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1505; (after Isaiah). The last clause, "for I will bring," etc., is quite in Jeremiah's peculiar style; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/4-23.htm">Jeremiah 4:23</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/23-12.htm">Jeremiah 23:12</a>. &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492; belongs to &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1502;&#1493;&#1488;&#1489;: the noun is anticipated by the pronoun, as frequently occurs; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/9-14.htm">Jeremiah 9:14</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/41-3.htm">Jeremiah 41:3</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/43-11.htm">Jeremiah 43:11</a>. </body></html>
