"I have heard tidings from Jahveh, and a messenger has been sent among the nations: Gather yourselves together, and go against her, and arise to the battle! <a href="/jeremiah/49-15.htm">Jeremiah 49:15</a>. For, behold, I have made thee small among the nations, despised among men. <a href="/jeremiah/49-16.htm">Jeremiah 49:16</a>. Thy terribleness hath deceived thee, the pride of thy heart, O thou that dwellest in the hiding-places of the rock, that holdest the height of the hill. Though thou makest thy nest high like the eagle, thence will I bring thee down, saith Jahveh. <a href="/jeremiah/49-17.htm">Jeremiah 49:17</a>. And Edom shall become an astonishment; every passer-by shall be astonished at her, and shall hiss at all her plagues. <a href="/jeremiah/49-18.htm">Jeremiah 49:18</a>. As [it was in] the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, saith Jahveh, no man shall dwell there, nor shall a son of man sojourn there."<p>This judgment will immediately take place. The nations who are to make Edom small and despised have been already summoned by the Lord to the war. Jeremiah has taken this idea from <a href="//biblehub.com/obadiah/1-1.htm">Obadiah 1:1</a>, <a href="/obadiah/1-2.htm">Obadiah 1:2</a>. The subject in "I have heard" is the prophet, who has heard the information from Jahveh. In Obadiah is found the plural, "we have heard," because the prophet includes himself among the people; this is to show that the news serves as a consolation to Israel, because Edom shall be punished for his crimes committed against Judah. This view was not before the mind of Jeremiah; with him the prevailing representation is, that judgment, from which Edom cannot be excepted, is passed upon all nations. Therefore he has chosen the singular, "I have heard." In the succeeding clause the perf. Pual &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1495; has been changed into &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;, as the more usual form. The messenger is to be considered as having been sent by the Lord for the purpose of summoning the nations to war, as he actually does in the second hemistich. The message agrees, in the nature of its contents, with <a href="/obadiah/1-1.htm">Obadiah 1:1</a>; but Jeremiah has dealt somewhat freely with its form. The statement with regard to the object of the war, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-15.htm">Jeremiah 49:15</a>, agrees pretty exactly with <a href="/obadiah/1-2.htm">Obadiah 1:2</a>. The account, too, which is given of the cause of the judgment, i.e., the guilt of Edom arising from his trusting in the impregnable character of his habitation, is derived from <a href="//biblehub.com/obadiah/1-3.htm">Obadiah 1:3</a>, <a href="/obadiah/1-4.htm">Obadiah 1:4</a>. Jeremiah has intensified the idea by the additional use of &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1500;&#1510;&#1514;&#1468;&#1498;, but has also made certain limitations of the expression by omitting some clauses found in Obadiah. The word just named is &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;., and has been variously explained. The verb &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1509; occurs only in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/9-6.htm">Job 9:6</a>, with the meaning of quaking, trembling; and the noun &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; pretty frequently in the sense of fear, shuddering, horror; further, &#1502;&#1508;&#1500;&#1510;&#1514; is used in <a href="/1_kings/15-13.htm">1 Kings 15:13</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-16.htm">2 Chronicles 15:16</a>, of an idol, monster, object of horror. Hence Rabbinical writers have been inclined to understand &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1500;&#1510;&#1514; as meaning idolatry; in this they are followed by J. D. Michaelis, Meier, and Ngelsbach. The last-named writer translates, "Thy monster (idol) led thee astray." But even though this meaning were better established from the use of language than it is, yet the mention of idolatry, or even of an idol, is quite unsuitable in this passage. The lxx render &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; i.e., risus or jocus tuus, Chald. &#1496;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1498;, "thy folly," - evidently a mere guess from the context. The best ascertained translation is, "Thy terror," i.e., the terror which thou dost inspire, or the fear of thee, "hath misled thee, the pride of thine heart," so that "the pride," etc., forms an apposition to "thy terror." The combination of the fem. &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1500;&#1510;&#1514;&#1468;&#1498; with the verb &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1497;&#1488; in the masc. is not decisive against this. Following the example of Schleussner (O arrogantiam tuam), Hitzig and Graf would take the word as an exclamation, "Terror to thee! horror on thee!" and thy point for support to &#1492;&#1508;&#1499;&#1468;&#1499;&#1501;, <a href="/isaiah/29-16.htm">Isaiah 29:16</a>. But an exclamation is out of place here, and incompatible with the derivation of the following words from Obadiah. Since Jeremiah appropriates from Obadiah the thought, "thy pride hath misled thee," &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1500;&#1510;&#1514;&#1468;&#1498; may possibly be meant as a mere intensification of &#1494;&#1491;&#1493;&#1497; &#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1498;. The pride of Edom increased because the other nations were afraid to make war on him in his rocky dwelling, so difficult of access. On &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1504;&#1497; &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1490;&#1493;&#1497; &#1492;&#1505;&#1468;&#1500;&#1506;, see on <a href="/obadiah/1-3.htm">Obadiah 1:3</a>. The succeeding apposition-clause &#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1501; &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;, found in Obadiah, is modified by Jeremiah into &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497; &#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1501; &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1506;&#1492; otni , "thou that seizest, or holdest (as in <a href="/jeremiah/40-10.htm">Jeremiah 40:10</a>), the height of the hill." In the expression &#1495;&#1490;&#1493;&#1497; there is perhaps implied an allusion to the rock-city &#1505;&#1500;&#1506;, or Petra, in the Wady Musa (see on <a href="/2_kings/14-7.htm">2 Kings 14:7</a>), and in &#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1501; &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1506;&#1492; ni dn another allusion to Bozrah, which lay on a hill; see on <a href="/jeremiah/49-13.htm">Jeremiah 49:13</a>. On <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-16.htm">Jeremiah 49:16</a>, cf. <a href="/obadiah/1-4.htm">Obadiah 1:4</a>. Jeremiah has omitted the hyperbolic addition, "among the stars." In <a href="/jeremiah/49-17.htm">Jeremiah 49:17</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/49-18.htm">Jeremiah 49:18</a> the devastation of Edom is further portrayed.

The comparison with Sodom, etc., is a reminiscence from <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-22.htm">Deuteronomy 29:22</a>, and is repeated in the prophecy concerning Babylon, 50:40; cf. <a href="/isaiah/13-19.htm">Isaiah 13:19</a>; <a href="/amos/4-11.htm">Amos 4:11</a>. "Her neighbours" are Admah and Zeboim, <a href="/deuteronomy/29-22.htm">Deuteronomy 29:22</a>; <a href="/hosea/11-8.htm">Hosea 11:8</a>. The comparison with Sodom is not so to be understood as if it indicated that Edom shall be destroyed in the same manner as Sodom; it is merely stated that the land of Edom shall become a desert waste, like the region of the Dead Sea, uninhabited, and with no human beings in it; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/49-33.htm">Jeremiah 49:33</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/50-40.htm">Jeremiah 50:40</a>.</body></html>
