The word translated “chosen one” is commonly associated with the idea of youth, the flower of a nation’s strength, its chosen champions. Commentators for the most part apply it to Nebuchadnezzar as being, in the full vigour of his strength, the chosen ruler whom Jehovah would appoint over Edom. The interrogative form, however, and the implied negative answer to the questions that follow suggest a different interpretation. “Who,” the prophet asks in a tone of scorn, as though Jehovah spoke by him, “is a chosen champion of Edom? and I will appoint him.” The implied answer is that Edom has no such champion. Compare the taunting words uttered by Jehu (<a href="/context/2_kings/10-2.htm" title="Now as soon as this letter comes to you, seeing your master's sons are with you, and there are with you chariots and horses, a fenced city also, and armor;">2Kings 10:2-3</a>)—“Look even out the best and meetest of your master’s sons”—and Rabshakeh (<a href="/2_kings/18-23.htm" title="Now therefore, I pray you, give pledges to my lord the king of Assyria, and I will deliver you two thousand horses, if you be able on your part to set riders on them.">2Kings 18:23</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Who is like me? and who will appoint me the time?</span>—The questions follow rapidly one on another in the same tone.

The Targum rightly interprets it of a king and his army, paraphrasing the words thus, <p>"behold, a king with his army shall come up against them, as a lion comes up from the height of Jordan;'' <p>not the king of Edom that should come up against Judea, or to defend himself against those that invaded him; but Nebuchadnezzar and his army that should come up against the Edomites from the land of Judea, where Jordan was, having first subdued that; or should come with that strength, fury, and fierceness, as a lion when forced out of its covert near the river Jordan, by the overflowing of its banks, and obliged to betake himself to higher grounds; who, being enraged, roars and tears in pieces all in his way. Monsieur Thevenot (w) says, that Jordan is beset on both sides with little, thick, and pleasant woods; and Mr. Maundrell (x) observes, that <p>"there is a first and outermost bank to the river, about a furlong, upon a level, before you come to the second bank, to which it may be supposed the river did, and still does, overflow; and the second bank is so beset with bushes and trees, such as tamarisk, willows, and oleanders, &amp;c. that you can see no water till you have made your way through them. In this thicket anciently (and the same is reported of at this day) several sorts of wild beasts were wont to harbour themselves, whose being washed out of the covert, by the over flowings of the river, gave occasion to the allusion, <a href="/jeremiah/49-19.htm">Jeremiah 49:19</a>.'' <p>So Jerom (y) speaks of lions, in his time, taking up their abode by the river Jordan, near which were desert places, reeds, and sedges: <p>against the habitation of the strong; the land of Edom, a country well fortified, in which mighty men dwelt; particularly Mount Seir, where their king was, and which was "the fold of the mighty"; either of the mighty shepherd, as it may be rendered (z); or of the strong place (a); but what is this to a lion? <p>but I will make him suddenly run away from her; that is, either the mighty shepherd, the king of Edom, from his fold, upon the approach of the lion, the king of Babylon; or else, as it may be rendered, "and I will cause him to run upon it (b) suddenly": that is, cause the king of Babylon to come speedily into the land of Edom, and seize upon it, overrun it, prevail over it, and be master of it, as Jarchi interprets it: <p>and who is a chosen man that I may appoint over her? a choice person in Nebuchadnezzar's army, fit to be made a deputy governor over the land of Edom: <p>for who is like me? for wisdom and power; able to do whatever I please, and to furnish those with proper abilities to perform and accomplish whatever I give them in charge and commission to do: <p>and who will appoint me the time? set a time to dispute the matter with me, or engage in war against me? <p>and who is that shepherd that will stand before me? or king, as the Targum and Ben Melech; any king, prince, or potentate, who, both in Scripture and in other writings, are often called shepherds; the king of Edom is particularly pointed at, whose habitation or fold is before observed: alas! what could such a shepherd do? or how could he stand before the almighty God, or any lion he should send? <p>(w) Travels, par. 1.

The root-meaning is simply "continuance," whether it be continuance of strength (comp. <a href="/micah/6-2.htm">Micah 6:2</a>, Hebrew) or of the flow of a stream (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-4.htm">Deuteronomy 21:4</a>; <a href="/amos/5-24.htm">Amos 5:24</a>), or, as here, of the perennial verdure of a well watered pasturage. <span class="cmt_word">But I will suddenly make him run away from her.</span> Make whom? The lion? Such is the natural inference  from the Authorized Version, but the context absolutely forbids it. It seems useless to mention the crowd of explanations which have been offered of this "obscure and much-vexed passage," as old Matthew Poole calls it, since in <a href="/jeremiah/50-44.htm">Jeremiah 50:44</a> we have precisely the same phrase, but with another suffix, which clears up the meaning. We may, therefore, either <span class="accented">read</span> (with the Septuagint and the Syriac Version), "For I will suddenly make them run away from it" (viz. the pasture), or keep the old reading "him" for "them," and explain "him" as meaning the Edomites. The expression used for "suddenly" is very forcible; we might render, with Ewald, "in the twinkling of an eye." <span class="cmt_word">And who is a chosen man,</span> etc.? A still more difficult clause. If the text is correct, which cannot be assumed as certain, we should probably render, with Ewald, "and will appoint over it [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the land of Edom] him who is chosen," viz. Nebuchadnezzar. <span class="cmt_word">Who will appoint me the time?</span> The same phrase is rendered in <a href="/job/9-19.htm">Job 9:19</a>, "Who shall set me a time to plead?" (comp. the Latin phrase <span class="accented">dicur dicere</span>). To drag a defendant before the tribunal implies equality of rank. One might venture to do this with Nebuchadnezzar, if he were not the representative of One still mightier. Finally, <span class="cmt_word">Who is that shepherd that will stand before me?</span> The land of Edom has been likened to a pasture; it is natural that the ruler should be now described as a shepherd (comp. Jeremiah 29:34) <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/49.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div><a href="/jeremiah/49-9.htm">Jeremiah 49:9</a> is a reproduction of <a href="//biblehub.com/obadiah/1-5.htm">Obadiah 1:5</a>, but in such a way that what Obadiah brings forward as a comparison is directly applied by Jeremiah to the enemy: our prophet represents the enemy as grape-gatherers who leave nothing to glean, and as nocturnal thieves who destroy what is sufficient for them, i.e., destroy till they have enough, drag away and destroy as much as they can. The after-clauses, "they will not leave," etc., "they destroy," etc., are thus not to be taken as questions. The reference to Obadiah does not entitle us to supply &#1492;&#1500;&#1493;&#1488; from that passage. The connection here is somewhat different. The following verse is joined by means of &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, "for;" and the thought, "for I have stripped Esau, I have discovered his secret places," shows that the enemy is to be understood by the grape-gatherers and nocturnal thieves: he will leave nothing to glean - will plunder all the goods and treasures of Edom, even those that have been hidden. On this subject, cf. <a href="/obadiah/1-6.htm">Obadiah 1:6</a>. &#1495;&#1513;&#1474;&#1507;, "to strip off leaves, make bare" (<a href="/jeremiah/13-26.htm">Jeremiah 13:26</a>), has been chosen with a regard to &#1504;&#1495;&#1508;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468; in Obadiah. &#1493;&#1504;&#1495;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492; &#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;, lit., "and he hides himself, he will not be able to do it;" i.e., Esau (Edom) tries to hide himself; he will not be able to do it - he will not remain concealed from the enemy. There are not sufficient grounds for changing the perf. &#1504;&#1495;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492;  equals &#1504;&#1495;&#1489;&#1468;&#1488;  into the inf. abs. &#1504;&#1495;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492;, as Ewald and Graf do. "His seed is destroyed," i.e., his family, the posterity of Esau, the Edomites, his brethren," the descendants of nations related to the family, and of others similar who had intermingled with them, as the Amalekites, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/36-12.htm">Genesis 36:12</a>, Horites, <a href="/genesis/36-20.htm">Genesis 36:20</a>., Simeonites, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-42.htm">1 Chronicles 4:42</a>, "and his neighbours," the neighbouring tribes, as Dedan, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-8.htm">Jeremiah 49:8</a>, Thema and Buz, <a href="/jeremiah/25-23.htm">Jeremiah 25:23</a>. "And he is not" is added to give intensity, as in <a href="/isaiah/19-7.htm">Isaiah 19:7</a>; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/31-15.htm">Jeremiah 31:15</a>. The last idea is made more intensive by <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-11.htm">Jeremiah 49:11</a>, "Leave your orphans and widows." Edom is addressed, and the imperative expresses what must happen. The men of Edom will be obliged to leave their wives and children, and these will be left behind as widows and orphans, because the men fall in battle. Yet the Lord will care for them, so that they shall not perish. In this comfort there is contained a very bitter truth for the Edomites who hated Jahveh. &#1506;&#1494;&#1489;&#1492; is the imperative (Ewald, 228, a), not infinitive (Hitzig); and &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1496;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468; is a rare form of the jussive for &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1496;&#1495;&#1504;&#1492;, as in <a href="/ezekiel/37-7.htm">Ezekiel 37:7</a>; cf. Ewald, 191, b. Reasons are given for these threats in <a href="/jeremiah/49-12.htm">Jeremiah 49:12</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-13.htm">Jeremiah 49:13</a>, first in the thought that Edom cannot continue to be the only one unpunished, then in the bringing forward of the solemnly uttered purpose of God. "Those who should not be compelled to drink." Those meant are the Israelites, who, as the people of God, ought to have been free from the penal judgment with which the Lord visits the nations. If, now, these are not left (spared such an infliction), still less can Edom, as a heathen nation, lay claim to exemption. By this Jeremiah does not mean to say that nay injustice befalls the Jews if they are obliged to drink the cup of the wrath of God, but merely that their having been chosen to be the people of God does not give them any right to exemption from the judgments of God on the world, i.e., if they make themselves like the heathen through their sins and vices. The inf. abs. &#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1493; for &#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1492; intensifies: "ye shall (must) drink." The idea is founded on that pervading <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/25.htm">Jeremiah 25</a>, and there is use made of the words in <a href="/jeremiah/25-29.htm">Jeremiah 25:29</a>. The &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; in <a href="/jeremiah/49-13.htm">Jeremiah 49:13</a> is mainly dependent on the clause immediately preceding: "thou shalt certainly drink." On "by myself have I sworn" cf. <a href="/jeremiah/22-5.htm">Jeremiah 22:5</a>. In the threat that Edom shall be laid waste there is an accumulation of words corresponding to the excitement of feeling accompanying an utterance under solemn oath. &#1495;&#1512;&#1489; is used instead of the more common &#1495;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492;; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/25-18.htm">Jeremiah 25:18</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-22.htm">Jeremiah 44:22</a>, etc. &#1495;&#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501;, as in <a href="/jeremiah/25-9.htm">Jeremiah 25:9</a>. Bozrah was at that time the capital of the Edomites (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/49-22.htm">Jeremiah 49:22</a>); it lay south from the Dead Sea, on the site of the village Buseireh (Little Bozrah), in Jebal, which is still surrounded by a castle and with ruins of considerable extent, and is situated on an eminence; see on <a href="/amos/1-12.htm">Amos 1:12</a> and <a href="/genesis/36-33.htm">Genesis 36:33</a>. "And all its cities," i.e., the rest of the cities of Idumea; cf. &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1492;, <a href="/jeremiah/49-2.htm">Jeremiah 49:2</a>.</body></html>
