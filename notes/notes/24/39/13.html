Observe here, reader, a king of Israel and his princes put the Lord’s prophet in prison, and a heathen king and his princes took him out! God’s people and ministers have often met with fairer and kinder treatment among strangers and infidels than among those who call themselves of the holy city. St. Paul found more favour and justice with King Agrippa than with Ananias the high-priest. But we shall meet with a more full account of Jeremiah’s release, and of the kind treatment he received from the Chaldeans, in the next chapter. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/39.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>39:11-14 The servants of God alone are prepared for all events; and they are delivered and comforted, while the wicked suffer.

It is remarkable that a different name is given to the Rab-saris in ver. 3; and the conjecture is not unreasonable that Sarsechim is a corruption of the latter part of the name Nebushasban.

"When Zedekiah the king of Judah and all the men of war saw them (the Chaldean generals who had taken up their position at the mid-gate), they fled by night out of the city, by the way of the king's garden, by a gate between the walls, and he went out by the way to the Arabah. <a href="/jeremiah/39-5.htm">Jeremiah 39:5</a>. But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after them, and overtook Zedekiah in the steppes of Jericho, and captured him, and brought him to Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, to Riblah, in the land of Hamath; and he pronounced judgment on him." Hitzig and Graf consider that the connection of these events, made by  &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1512;&#1488;&#1501;, is awkward, and say that the king would not have waited till the Chaldean generals took up their position at the mid-gate, nor could he see these in the night-time; that, moreover, he would hardly have waited till the city was taken before he fled. These objections are utterly worthless. If the city of Zion, in which the royal palace stood, was separated from the lower city by a wall, then the king might still be quite at ease, with his men of war, in the upper city or city of Zion, so long as the enemy, who were pushing into the lower city from the north, remained at the separating wall, near the middle gate in it; and only when he saw that the city of Zion, too, could no longer be held, did he need to betake himself to flight with the men of war around him. In actual fact, then, he might have been able to see the Chaldean generals with his own eyes, although we need not press &#1512;&#1488;&#1501; so much as to extract this meaning from it. Even at this juncture, flight was still possible through the south gate, at the king's garden, between the two walls. Thenius, on <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/25-4.htm">2 Kings 25:4</a>, takes &#1495;&#1502;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501; to mean a double wall, which at the southern end of Ophel closed up the ravine between Ophel and Zion. But a double wall must also have had two gates, and Thenius, indeed, has exhibited them in his plan of Jerusalem; but the text speaks of but one gate (&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512;). "The two walls" are rather the walls which ran along the eastern border of Zion and the western border of Ophel. The gate between these was situated in the wall which ran across the Tyropoean valley, and united the wall of Zion and that of Ophel; it was called the horse-gate (<a href="/nehemiah/3-28.htm">Nehemiah 3:28</a>), and occupied the position of the modern "dung-gate" (Bab-el Moghribeh); see on <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-27.htm">Nehemiah 3:27-28</a>. It was not the "gate of the fountain," as Thenius (Bcher der Kn. S. 456), Ngelsbach, and others imagine, founding on the supposed existence of the double wall at the south end of Ophel. Outside this gate, where the valley of the Tyropoeon joined with the valley of the Kidron, lay the king's garden, in the vicinity of the pool of Siloam; see on <a href="/nehemiah/3-15.htm">Nehemiah 3:15</a>. The words '&#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1510;&#1488; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; introduce further details as to the king's flight. In spite of the preceding plurals &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468; , the sing. &#1497;&#1510;&#1488; is quite suitable here, since the narrator wishes to give further details with regard to the flight of the king alone, without bringing into consideration the warriors who fled along with him. Nor does the following &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; militate against this view; for the Chaldean warriors pursued the king and his followers, not to capture these followers, but the king. Escaped from the city, the king took the direction of the &#1506;&#1512;&#1489;&#1492;, the plain of the Jordan, in order to escape over Jordan to Gilead. But the pursuing enemy overtook him in the steppes of Jericho (see Comm. on Joshua on <a href="/joshua/4-13.htm">Joshua 4:13</a>), and thus before he had crossed the Jordan; they led him, bound, to Riblah, before the king of Babylon. "Riblah in the land of Hamath" is still called Ribleh, a wretched village about 20 miles S.S.W. from Hums (Emesa) on the river el Ahsy (Orontes), in a large fertile plain in the northern portion of the Beka, on the great caravan-track which passes from Palestine through Damascus, Emesa, and Hamath to Thapsacus and Carchemish on the Euphrates; see Robinson's Bibl. Res. iii. 545, and on Comm. on Kings at <a href="/2_kings/23-33.htm">2 Kings 23:33</a>. - On &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;&#1497;&#1501;, to speak judgment, pronounce sentence of punishment, see on <a href="/jeremiah/1-16.htm">Jeremiah 1:16</a>. Nebuchadnezzar caused the sons of Zedekiah and all the princes of Judah (&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, nobles, lords, as in 27:30) to be slain before the eyes of the Jewish king; then he put out his eyes and bound him with brazen fetters, to carry him away to Babylon (&#1500;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488; for &#1500;&#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488;), where, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-11.htm">Jeremiah 52:11</a>, he remained in confinement till his death.</body></html>
