This he may have heard from the deserters named in <a href="/jeremiah/39-9.htm" title="Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Babylon the remnant of the people that remained in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to him, with the rest of the people that remained.">Jeremiah 39:9</a>, or even from the lips of Zedekiah. Possibly the journey to Euphrates, of which we read in <a href="/jeremiah/13-5.htm" title="So I went, and hid it by Euphrates, as the LORD commanded me.">Jeremiah 13:5</a>, may, at even an earlier period, have brought the king and the prophet into contact. From the time of Nebuzar-adan’s arrival, the position of Jeremiah was obviously changed for the better, and he became an honoured and trusted counsellor. It appears from <a href="/jeremiah/40-1.htm" title="The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, after that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah, when he had taken him being bound in chains among all that were carried away captive of Jerusalem and Judah, which were carried away captive to Babylon.">Jeremiah 40:1</a> that the prophet had at first been taken in chains to Ramah, with the other captives. Probably he had been sent back to Jerusalem when the others were carried off to Riblah, or Babylon (<a href="/context/jeremiah/39-6.htm" title="Then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah before his eyes: also the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of Judah.">Jeremiah 39:6-9</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/39.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/jeremiah/39-11.htm" title="Now Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning Jeremiah to Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, saying,...">Jeremiah 39:11-12</a></span>. <span class="ital">Now Nebuchadrezzar gave charge concerning Jeremiah </span>— He had undoubtedly been informed of the advice which Jeremiah had given, both to the king and people, to submit themselves to his authority: which advice, if it had been taken, would have prevented the charge and labour of so long a siege, and the bloodshed that attended it. <span class="ital">Saying, Take him and look well to him </span>— Through this order of the king of Babylon, God fulfilled his promise made <a href="/jeremiah/15-11.htm" title="The LORD said, Truly it shall be well with your remnant; truly I will cause the enemy to entreat you well in the time of evil and in the time of affliction.">Jeremiah 15:11</a>, <span class="ital">I will cause the enemy to treat thee well in the day of evil. </span>Jeremiah had been faithful to his God as a prophet, and now God approves himself faithful to him, and the promise he had made him. Now he is comforted, according to the time wherein he had been afflicted, and sees many fall on each hand while he is safe. The false prophets fell by those judgments which they affirmed would never come, (<a href="/jeremiah/14-15.htm" title="Therefore thus said the LORD concerning the prophets that prophesy in my name, and I sent them not, yet they say, Sword and famine shall not be in this land; By sword and famine shall those prophets be consumed.">Jeremiah 14:15</a>,) which made their misery the more terrible to them. The true prophet escaped those judgments which he said would come, and that made his escape the more comfortable to him. The same persons who were the instruments of punishing the persecutors, were the instruments of relieving the persecuted; and Jeremiah did not the less prize his deliverance, because it came by the hand of the king of Babylon, but saw thereby more of the hand of God in it.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/39.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>39:11-14 The servants of God alone are prepared for all events; and they are delivered and comforted, while the wicked suffer.

Of whom he had heard, by one or another of his generals or officers; who had been informed, by those Jews that deserted to them, that Jeremiah had prophesied of the taking of the city by the Chaldeans; had advised the people to fall off to them; and had even exhorted the king and princes to surrender up the city, and themselves, unto them; and that he had suffered much on this account; wherefore the Lord put it into the heart of this monarch, otherwise not at all disposed to the prophets of the Lord, to show regard to him; and therefore, when he sent Nebuzaradan upon an expedition to Jerusalem, he gave him a particular charge concerning Jeremiah: <p>saying; as follows: <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/39.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Now Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning Jeremiah to Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, saying,</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/39.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">11–14</span>.

"When Zedekiah the king of Judah and all the men of war saw them (the Chaldean generals who had taken up their position at the mid-gate), they fled by night out of the city, by the way of the king's garden, by a gate between the walls, and he went out by the way to the Arabah. <a href="/jeremiah/39-5.htm">Jeremiah 39:5</a>. But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after them, and overtook Zedekiah in the steppes of Jericho, and captured him, and brought him to Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, to Riblah, in the land of Hamath; and he pronounced judgment on him." Hitzig and Graf consider that the connection of these events, made by  &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1512;&#1488;&#1501;, is awkward, and say that the king would not have waited till the Chaldean generals took up their position at the mid-gate, nor could he see these in the night-time; that, moreover, he would hardly have waited till the city was taken before he fled. These objections are utterly worthless. If the city of Zion, in which the royal palace stood, was separated from the lower city by a wall, then the king might still be quite at ease, with his men of war, in the upper city or city of Zion, so long as the enemy, who were pushing into the lower city from the north, remained at the separating wall, near the middle gate in it; and only when he saw that the city of Zion, too, could no longer be held, did he need to betake himself to flight with the men of war around him. In actual fact, then, he might have been able to see the Chaldean generals with his own eyes, although we need not press &#1512;&#1488;&#1501; so much as to extract this meaning from it. Even at this juncture, flight was still possible through the south gate, at the king's garden, between the two walls. Thenius, on <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/25-4.htm">2 Kings 25:4</a>, takes &#1495;&#1502;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501; to mean a double wall, which at the southern end of Ophel closed up the ravine between Ophel and Zion. But a double wall must also have had two gates, and Thenius, indeed, has exhibited them in his plan of Jerusalem; but the text speaks of but one gate (&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512;). "The two walls" are rather the walls which ran along the eastern border of Zion and the western border of Ophel. The gate between these was situated in the wall which ran across the Tyropoean valley, and united the wall of Zion and that of Ophel; it was called the horse-gate (<a href="/nehemiah/3-28.htm">Nehemiah 3:28</a>), and occupied the position of the modern "dung-gate" (Bab-el Moghribeh); see on <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-27.htm">Nehemiah 3:27-28</a>. It was not the "gate of the fountain," as Thenius (Bcher der Kn. S. 456), Ngelsbach, and others imagine, founding on the supposed existence of the double wall at the south end of Ophel. Outside this gate, where the valley of the Tyropoeon joined with the valley of the Kidron, lay the king's garden, in the vicinity of the pool of Siloam; see on <a href="/nehemiah/3-15.htm">Nehemiah 3:15</a>. The words '&#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1510;&#1488; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; introduce further details as to the king's flight. In spite of the preceding plurals &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468; , the sing. &#1497;&#1510;&#1488; is quite suitable here, since the narrator wishes to give further details with regard to the flight of the king alone, without bringing into consideration the warriors who fled along with him. Nor does the following &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; militate against this view; for the Chaldean warriors pursued the king and his followers, not to capture these followers, but the king. Escaped from the city, the king took the direction of the &#1506;&#1512;&#1489;&#1492;, the plain of the Jordan, in order to escape over Jordan to Gilead. But the pursuing enemy overtook him in the steppes of Jericho (see Comm. on Joshua on <a href="/joshua/4-13.htm">Joshua 4:13</a>), and thus before he had crossed the Jordan; they led him, bound, to Riblah, before the king of Babylon. "Riblah in the land of Hamath" is still called Ribleh, a wretched village about 20 miles S.S.W. from Hums (Emesa) on the river el Ahsy (Orontes), in a large fertile plain in the northern portion of the Beka, on the great caravan-track which passes from Palestine through Damascus, Emesa, and Hamath to Thapsacus and Carchemish on the Euphrates; see Robinson's Bibl. Res. iii. 545, and on Comm. on Kings at <a href="/2_kings/23-33.htm">2 Kings 23:33</a>. - On &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;&#1497;&#1501;, to speak judgment, pronounce sentence of punishment, see on <a href="/jeremiah/1-16.htm">Jeremiah 1:16</a>. Nebuchadnezzar caused the sons of Zedekiah and all the princes of Judah (&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, nobles, lords, as in 27:30) to be slain before the eyes of the Jewish king; then he put out his eyes and bound him with brazen fetters, to carry him away to Babylon (&#1500;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488; for &#1500;&#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488;), where, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-11.htm">Jeremiah 52:11</a>, he remained in confinement till his death.</body></html>
