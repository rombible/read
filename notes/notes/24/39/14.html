Gedaliah was the representative of a house which for three generations had been true to the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord. Shaphan had been the king’s scribe in the early years of Josiah, and had taken an active part in the restoration of the Temple (<a href="/context/2_kings/22-3.htm" title="And it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, that the king sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, the son of Meshullam, the scribe, to the house of the LORD, saying,">2Kings 22:3-7</a>).

Gedaliah&#8212;son of Ahikam, the former supporter of Jeremiah (Jer 26:24). Gedaliah was the chief of the deserters to the Chaldeans, and was set over the remnant in Judea as one likely to remain faithful to Nebuchadnezzar. His residence was at Mizpah (Jer 40:5).<p>home&#8212;the house of Gedaliah, wherein Jeremiah might remain as in a safe asylum. As in Jer 40:1 Jeremiah is represented as "bound in chains" when he came to Ramah among the captives to be carried to Babylon, this release of Jeremiah is thought by Maurer to be distinct from that in Jer 40:5, 6. But he seems first to have been released from the court of the prison and to have been taken to Ramah, still in chains, and then committed in freedom to Gedaliah.<p>dwelt among the people&#8212;that is, was made free.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/39.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The king of Babylon’s officers were very religious to their prince’s order, and take the prophet out of prison.

From the more detailed notice regarding the fate of the city, given in <a href="/jeremiah/52-12.htm">Jeremiah 52:12</a>., <a href="/2_kings/25-8.htm">2 Kings 25:8</a>., we see that the destruction of the city and the carrying away of the people took place one month after their fall, and that the king of Babylon had appointed Nebuzaradan, the commander of his body-guards, to go to Jerusalem for the purpose of carrying out these matters. In these verses of ours, also, Nebuzaradan is mentioned as the one who carried out the judgment that had been pronounced (<a href="/jeremiah/39-10.htm">Jeremiah 39:10</a>.); but the fact of his being sent from Riblah and the date of the execution of his commission are here omitted, so that it appears as if it had all occurred immediately after the capture of the city, and as if Nebuzaradan had been always on the spot. For the writer of this chapter did not need to give a historically exact account of the separate events; it was merely necessary briefly to mention the chief points, in order to place in proper light the treatment experienced by the prophet. The Chaldeans burned the king's house (the palace) and &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492;&#1506;&#1501;. This latter expression, taken in connection with "the king's house," signifies the rest of the city apart from the king's palace; hence &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; is used in a collective sense. the temple is not mentioned, as being of no consequence for the immediate purpose of this short notice.</body></html>
