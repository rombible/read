A fuller narrative of the siege and capture is given in Jeremiah 52. The two verses which open the chapter seem to have been inserted here by the editor of the prophecies in their present form, as explaining the fact with which Jeremiah 38 had closed. The siege had lasted eighteen months, beginning in B.C. 590 and ending B.C. 588. It came to an end, as we learn from <a href="/jeremiah/52-6.htm" title="And in the fourth month, in the ninth day of the month, the famine was sore in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land.">Jeremiah 52:6</a>, through the pressure of the famine, of which we have seen traces in <a href="/jeremiah/37-21.htm" title="Then Zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit Jeremiah into the court of the prison, and that they should give him daily a piece of bread out of the bakers' street, until all the bread in the city were spent. Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.">Jeremiah 37:21</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/maclaren/jeremiah/39.htm">MacLaren's Expositions</a></div>Jeremiah<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">THE LAST AGONY<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/jeremiah/39-1.htm" title="In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, came Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and all his army against Jerusalem, and they besieged it.">Jeremiah 39:1</a> - <a href="/jeremiah/39-10.htm" title="But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people, which had nothing, in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time.">Jeremiah 39:10</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Two characteristics of this account of the fall of Jerusalem are striking,-its minute particularity, giving step by step the details of the tragedy, and its entire suppression of emotion. The passionless record tells the tale without a tear or a sob. For these we must go to the Book of Lamentations. This is the history of God’s judgment, and here emotion would be misplaced. But there is a world of repressed feeling in the long-drawn narrative, as well as in the fact that three versions of the story are given here {<a href="/jeremiah/52-1.htm" title="Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.">Jeremiah 52:1</a> - <a href="/jeremiah/52-34.htm" title="And for his diet, there was a continual diet given him of the king of Babylon, every day a portion until the day of his death, all the days of his life.">Jeremiah 52:34</a>, <a href="/2_kings/25-1.htm" title="And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he, and all his host, against Jerusalem, and pitched against it; and they built forts against it round about.">2 Kings 25:1</a> - <a href="/2_kings/25-30.htm" title="And his allowance was a continual allowance given him of the king, a daily rate for every day, all the days of his life.">2 Kings 25:30</a>}. Sorrow curbed by submission, and steadily gazing on God’s judicial act, is the temper of the narrative. It should be the temper of all sufferers. ‘I was dumb, I opened not my mouth; because thou didst it.’ But we may note the three stages in the final agony which this section distinguishes.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. There is the entrance of the enemy.</span> Jerusalem fell not by assault, but by famine. The siege lasted eighteen months, and ended when ‘all the bread in the city was spent.’ The pitiful pictures in Lamentations fill in the details of misery, telling how high-born women picked garbage from dung-heaps, and mothers made a ghastly meal of their infants, while the nobles were wasted to skeletons, and the little children piteously cried for bread. At length a breach was made in the northern wall {as Josephus tells us, ‘at midnight’}, and through it, on the ninth day of the fourth month {corresponding to July}, swarmed the conquerors, unresisted. The commanders of the Babylonians planted themselves at ‘the middle gate,’ probably a gate in the wall between the upper and lower city, so securing for them the control of both.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> How many of these fierce soldiers are named in <a href="/jeremiah/39-3.htm" title="And all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in the middle gate, even Nergalsharezer, Samgarnebo, Sarsechim, Rabsaris, Nergalsharezer, Rabmag, with all the residue of the princes of the king of Babylon.">Jeremiah 39:3</a>? At first sight there seem to be six, but that number must be reduced by at least two, for Rab-saris and Rab-mag are official titles, and designate the offices {chief eunuch and chief magician} of the two persons whose names they respectively follow. Possibly Samgar-Nebo is also to be deducted, for it has been suggested that, as that name stands, it is anomalous, and it has been proposed to render its first element, <span class="ital">Samgar</span>, as meaning <span class="ital">cup-bearer</span>, and being the official title attached to the name preceding it; while its second part, <span class="ital">Nebo</span>, is regarded as the first element in a new name obtained by reading <span class="ital">shashban</span> instead of Sarsechim, and attaching that reading to Nebo. This change would bring <a href="/jeremiah/39-3.htm" title="And all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in the middle gate, even Nergalsharezer, Samgarnebo, Sarsechim, Rabsaris, Nergalsharezer, Rabmag, with all the residue of the princes of the king of Babylon.">Jeremiah 39:3</a> into accord with <a href="/jeremiah/39-13.htm" title="So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent, and Nebushasban, Rabsaris, and Nergalsharezer, Rabmag, and all the king of Babylon's princes;">Jeremiah 39:13</a>, for in both places we should then have Nebo-shashban designated as chief of the eunuchs. However the number of the commanders is settled, and whatever their names, the point which the historian emphasises is their presence there. Had it come to this, that men whose very names were invocations of false gods {‘Nergal protect the king,’ ‘Nebo delivers me’ if we read ‘Nebo-shashban,’ or ‘Be gracious, Nebo,’ if Samgar-nebo} should sit close by the temple, and have their talons fixed in the Holy City?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> These intruders were all unconscious of the meaning of their victory, and the tragedy of their presence there. They thought that they were Nebuchadnezzar’s servants, and had captured for him, at last, an obstinate little city, which had given more trouble than it was worth. Its conquest was but a drop in the bucket of his victories. How little they knew that they were serving that Jehovah whom they thought that Nebo had conquered in their persons! How little they knew that they were the instruments of the most solemn act of judgment in the world’s history till then!<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The causes which led to the fall of Jerusalem could be reasonably set forth as purely political without a single reference to Israel’s sins or God’s judgment; but none the less was its capture the divine punishment of its departure from Him, and none the less were Nergal-sharezer and his fellows God’s tools, the axes with which He hewed down the barren tree. So does He work still, in national and individual history. You may, in a fashion, account for both without bringing Him in at all; but your philosophy of either will be partial, unless you recognise that ‘the history of the world is the judgment of the world.’ It was the same hand which set these harsh conquerors at the middle gate of Jerusalem that sent the German armies to encamp in the Place de la Concorde in Paris; and in neither case does the recognition of God in the crash of a falling throne absolve the victors from the responsibility of their deeds.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. We have the flight and fate of Zedekiah and his evil advisers</span> {<a href="/jeremiah/39-4.htm" title="And it came to pass, that when Zedekiah the king of Judah saw them, and all the men of war, then they fled, and went forth out of the city by night, by the way of the king's garden, by the gate between the two walls: and he went out the way of the plain.">Jeremiah 39:4</a> - <a href="/jeremiah/39-7.htm" title="Moreover he put out Zedekiah's eyes, and bound him with chains, to carry him to Babylon.">Jeremiah 39:7</a>}. His weakness of character shows itself to the end. Why was there no resistance? It would have better beseemed him to have died on his palace threshold than to have skulked away in the dark between the shelter of the ‘two walls.’ But he was a poor weakling, and the curse of God sat heavy on his soul, though he had tried to put it away. Conscience made a coward of him; for he, at all events, knew who had set the strangers by the middle gate. Men who harden heart and conscience against threatened judgments are very apt to collapse, when the threats are fulfilled. The frost breaks up with a rapid thaw.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Ezekiel {<a href="/ezekiel/12-12.htm" title="And the prince that is among them shall bear on his shoulder in the twilight, and shall go forth: they shall dig through the wall to carry out thereby: he shall cover his face, that he see not the ground with his eyes.">Ezekiel 12:12</a>} prophesied the very details of the flight. It was to be ‘in the dark,’ the king himself was to ‘carry’ some of his valuables, they were to ‘dig through’ the earthen ramparts; and all appears to have been literally fulfilled. The flight was taken in the opposite direction from the entrance of the besiegers; two walls, which probably ran down the valley between Zion and the temple mount, afforded cover to the fugitives as far as to the south city wall, and there some postern let them out to the king’s garden. That is a tragic touch. It was no time then to gather flowers. The forlorn and frightened company seems to have scattered when once outside the city; for there is a marked contrast in <a href="/jeremiah/39-4.htm" title="And it came to pass, that when Zedekiah the king of Judah saw them, and all the men of war, then they fled, and went forth out of the city by night, by the way of the king's garden, by the gate between the two walls: and he went out the way of the plain.">Jeremiah 39:4</a> between ‘they fled’ and ‘he went.’ In the description of his flight Zedekiah is still called, as in <a href="/jeremiah/39-1.htm" title="In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, came Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and all his army against Jerusalem, and they besieged it.">Jeremiah 39:1</a> - <a href="/jeremiah/39-2.htm" title="And in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, the ninth day of the month, the city was broken up.">Jeremiah 39:2</a>, the king; but after his capture he is only ‘Zedekiah.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Down the rocky valley of the Kedron he hurried, and had a long enough start of his pursuers to get to Jericho. Another hour would have seen him safe across Jordan, but the prospect of escape was only dangled before his eyes to make capture more bitter. Probably he was too much absorbed with his misery and fear to feel any additional humiliation from the mighty memories of the scene of his capture; but how solemnly fitting it was that the place which had seen Israel’s first triumph, when ‘by faith the walls of Jericho fell down,’ should witness the lowest shame of the king who had cast away his kingdom by unbelief! The conquering dead might have gathered in shadowy shapes to reproach the weakling and sluggard who had sinned away the heritage which they had won. The scene of the capture underscores the lesson of the capture itself; namely, the victorious power of faith, and the defeat and shame which, in the long-run, are the fruits of an ‘evil heart of unbelief, departing from the living God.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> That would be a sad march through all the length of the fair land that had slipped from his slack fingers, up to far-off Riblah, in the great valley between the Lebanon and the anti-Lebanon. Observe how, in <a href="/jeremiah/39-5.htm" title="But the Chaldeans' army pursued after them, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho: and when they had taken him, they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he gave judgment on him.">Jeremiah 39:5</a> - <a href="/jeremiah/39-6.htm" title="Then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah before his eyes: also the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of Judah.">Jeremiah 39:6</a>, the king of Babylon has his royal title, and Zedekiah has not. The crown has fallen from his head, and there is no more a king in Judah. He who had been king now stands chained before the cruel conqueror. Well might the victor think that Nebo had overcome Jehovah, but better did the vanquished know that Jehovah had kept his word.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Cruelty and expediency dictated the savage massacre and mutilation which followed. The death of Zedekiah’s sons, and of the nobles who had scoffed at Jeremiah’s warnings, and the blinding of Zedekiah, were all measures of precaution as well as of savagery. They diminished the danger of revolt; and a blind, childless prisoner, without counsellors or friends, was harmless. But to make the sight of his slaughtered sons the poor wretch’s last sight, was a refinement of gratuitous delight in torturing. Thus singularly was Ezekiel’s enigma solved and harmonised with its apparent contradictions in Jeremiah’s prophecies: ‘Yet shall he not see it, though he shall die there’ {<a href="/ezekiel/12-13.htm" title="My net also will I spread on him, and he shall be taken in my snare: and I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the Chaldeans; yet shall he not see it, though he shall die there.">Ezekiel 12:13</a>}.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Zedekiah is one more instance of the evil which may come from a weak character, and of the evil which may fall on it. He had good impulses, but he could not hold his own against the bad men round him, and so he stumbled on, not without misgivings, which only needed to be attended to with resolute determination, in order to have reversed his conduct and fate. Feeble hands can pull down venerable structures built in happier times. It takes a David and a Solomon to rear a temple, but a Zedekiah can overthrow it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">III. We have the completion of the conquest</span> {<a href="/jeremiah/39-8.htm" title="And the Chaldeans burned the king's house, and the houses of the people, with fire, and broke down the walls of Jerusalem.">Jeremiah 39:8</a> - <a href="/jeremiah/39-10.htm" title="But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people, which had nothing, in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time.">Jeremiah 39:10</a>}. The first care of the victors was, of course, to secure themselves, and fires and crowbars were the readiest way to that end. But the wail in the last chapter of Lamentations hints at the usual atrocities of the sack of a city, when brutal lust and as brutal ferocity are let loose. <a href="/jeremiah/52-1.htm" title="Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.">Jeremiah 52:1</a> - <a href="/jeremiah/52-34.htm" title="And for his diet, there was a continual diet given him of the king of Babylon, every day a portion until the day of his death, all the days of his life.">Jeremiah 52:34</a> shows that the final step in our narrative was separated from the capture of the city by a month, which was, no doubt, a month of nameless agonies, horrors, and shame. Then the last drop was added to the bitter cup, in the deportation of the bulk of the inhabitants, according to the politic custom of these old military monarchies. What rending of ties, what weariness and years of long-drawn-out yearning, that meant, can easily be imagined. The residue left behind to keep the country from relapsing into waste land was too weak to be dangerous, and too cowed to dare anything. One knows not who had the sadder lot, the exiles, or the handful of peasants left to till the fields that had once been their own, and to lament their brethren gone captives to the far-off land.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Surely the fall of Jerusalem, though all the agony is calmed ages ago, still remains as a solemn beacon-warning that the wages of sin is death, both for nations and individuals; that the threatenings of God’s Word are not idle, but will be accomplished to the utmost tittle; and that His patience stretches from generation to generation, and His judgments tarry because He is not willing that any should perish, but that for all the long-suffering there comes a time when even divine love sees that it is needful to say ‘Now!? and the bolt falls. The solemn word addressed to Israel has application as real to all Christian churches and individual souls: ‘You only have I known of all the inhabitants of the earth; therefore I will punish you for your iniquities.’<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/39.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/jeremiah/39-1.htm" title="In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, came Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and all his army against Jerusalem, and they besieged it....">Jeremiah 39:1-3</a></span>. <span class="ital">In the ninth year of Zedekiah, </span>&c. — See notes on <a href="/context/2_kings/25-1.htm" title="And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he, and all his host, against Jerusalem, and pitched against it; and they built forts against it round about....">2 Kings 25:1-4</a>. <span class="ital">And all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in the middle gate </span>— Or, <span class="ital">the gate of the centre, </span>as Blaney translates it, observing, “The city of Jerusalem stood upon two hills, Zion to the south, and Acra to the north, with a deep valley between them. <span class="ital">The gate of the centre, </span>as the term seems plainly to import, was a gate of communication in the middle of the valley between the two parts of the city, sometimes called <span class="ital">the higher and the lower city. </span>The Chaldeans entered the city on the north side by a breach in the walls, and immediately rushing forward, and posting themselves in this gate, in the very heart of the city, they became thereby masters at will of the whole.

The month Tebet, which answers to part of our December, and part of January; so that it was in the winter season the siege of Jerusalem began: <p>came Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and all his army against Jerusalem,  <p>and they besieged it; provoked by Zedekiah's breaking covenant with him, and rebelling against him, who had set him upon his throne, in the room of his nephew; so that here was a mixture of perfidy and ingratitude, which he was determined to revenge; and being impatient of it, came at such an unseasonable time of the year for a long march and a siege. The king of Babylon came in person at first; but having begun the siege, and given proper orders to his generals for the carrying of it on, and supposing it would be a long one, retired to Riblah in Syria, either for pleasure or for business. The time of beginning the siege exactly agrees with the account in <a href="/2_kings/25-1.htm">2 Kings 25:1</a>; only there it is more particular, expressing the day of the month, which was the tenth of it; and so in <a href="/jeremiah/52-4.htm">Jeremiah 52:4</a>. The reason of inserting the account of the siege and taking of the city, in this place, is both to show the exact accomplishment of Jeremiah's prophecies about it, and to lead on to some facts and predictions that followed it. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/39.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, came Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and all his army against Jerusalem, and they besieged it.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/39.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><a href="/jeremiah/39-3.htm" title="And all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in the middle gate, even Nergalsharezer, Samgarnebo, Sarsechim, Rabsaris, Nergalsharezer, Rabmag, with all the residue of the princes of the king of Babylon."><span class="bld">Jeremiah 39:3</a>.</span> <span class="ital">and sat</span>] to carry out the matters arising from the capture.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Nergal-sharezer, etc</span>.] From the Eng. it would appear that there are six princes mentioned by name. In fact however there are but four at the most (and probably only two), viz. (<span class="ital">a</span>) Nergal-sharezer, (<span class="ital">b</span>) Samgar-nebo, (<span class="ital">c</span>) Sarsechim, (<span class="ital">d</span>) Nergal-sharezer. But (<span class="ital">d</span>) is probably an erroneous repetition of (<span class="ital">a</span>). Rab-saris (usually explained <span class="ital">chief of the eunuchs</span> or <span class="ital">chamberlains</span> but more probably <span class="ital">chief of the heads</span>, i.e. principal men) and Rab-mag (probably <span class="ital">chief of the soothsayers</span>) are the <span class="ital">titles</span> of those whose names they follow. Moreover, the first part of Samgar-nebo is probably a corruption of Sar-mag = Rab-mag, <span class="ital">chief of the soothsayers</span>, while the latter portion, inasmuch as it never elsewhere <span class="ital">ends</span> a name, is to be transferred to the beginning of the third name. Sarsechim, thus becoming Nebo-sarsechim, is an error for Nebushazban of <span class="ital"><a href="/jeremiah/39-13.htm" title="So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent, and Nebushasban, Rabsaris, and Nergalsharezer, Rabmag, and all the king of Babylon's princes;">Jeremiah 39:13</a></span>. The above modifications of the text thus reduce the list to the more accurate form in which it appears in <span class="ital"><a href="/jeremiah/39-13.htm" title="So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent, and Nebushasban, Rabsaris, and Nergalsharezer, Rabmag, and all the king of Babylon's princes;">Jeremiah 39:13</a></span>, viz. two names and two titles, i.e. Nergal-sharezer the Rab-mag and Nebushazban the Rab-saris. Nergal-sharezer was a son-in-law of Nebuchadnezzar, and after the murder of Evil-Merodach (b.c. 560) seized the throne.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/38.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Against the advice that he should save his life by surrendering to the Chaldeans, Zedekiah suggests the consideration, "I am afraid of the Jews, who have deserted [&#1504;&#1508;&#1500; &#1488;&#1500; as in <a href="/jeremiah/37-13.htm">Jeremiah 37:13</a>] to the Chaldeans, lest they give me into their hands and maltreat me." &#1492;&#1514;&#1506;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500; &#1489;&#1468;, illudere alicui, to abuse any one by mockery or ill-treatment; cf. <a href="/numbers/22-29.htm">Numbers 22:29</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/10-4.htm">1 Chronicles 10:4</a>, etc. Jeremiah replies, <a href="/jeremiah/38-20.htm">Jeremiah 38:20</a>., "They will not give thee up. Yet, pray, listen to the voice of Jahveh, in that which I say to thee, that it may be well with thee, and that thy soul may live. <a href="/jeremiah/38-21.htm">Jeremiah 38:21</a>. But if thou dost refuse to go out i.e., to surrender thyself to the Chaldeans, this is the word which the Lord hath shown me has revealed to me: <a href="/jeremiah/38-22.htm">Jeremiah 38:22</a>. Behold, all the women that are left in the house of the king of Judah shall be brought out to the princes of the king of Babylon, and those [women] shall say, Thy friends have misled thee and have overcome thee; thy feet are sunk in the mud, they have turned away back. <a href="/jeremiah/38-23.htm">Jeremiah 38:23</a>. And all thy wives and thy children shall they bring out to the Chaldeans, and thou shalt not escape out of their hand; for thou shalt be seized by the hand of the king of Babylon, and thou shalt burn this city with fire." - After Jeremiah had once more assured the king that he would save his life by voluntary surrender, he announces to him that, on the other alternative, instead of his becoming the sport of the deserters, the women of his harem would be insulted. The women who remain in the king's house, as distinguished from "thy wives" (<a href="/jeremiah/38-23.htm">Jeremiah 38:23</a>), are the women of the royal harem, the wives of former kings, who remain in the harem as the concubines of the reigning king. These are to be brought out to the generals of the Chaldean king, and to sing a satire on him, to this effect: "Thy friends have misled thee, and overpowered thee," etc. The first sentence of this song is from <a href="//biblehub.com/obadiah/1-7.htm">Obadiah 1:7</a>, where &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1497;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498; ere stands instead of &#1492;&#1505;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498;.

Through their counsels, these have led him astray, and brought him into a bog, in which his feet stick fast, and then they have gone back; i.e., instead of helping him out, they have deserted him, leaving him sticking in the bog. The expression is figurative, and the meaning of the figure is plain (&#1512;&#1490;&#1500;&#1498; is plural). &#1489;&#1468;&#1509;, &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0; &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;.., is equivalent to &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1468;&#1492;, a bog, <a href="/job/8-11.htm">Job 8:11</a>. Moreover, the wives and children of Zedekiah are to fall into the hand of the Chaldeans. &#1502;&#1493;&#1510;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501;, the participle, is used instead of the finite tense to express the notion of indefinite personality: "they bring them out." &#1514;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1513;&#1474; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491; ".tuo meht gnirb , properly, "to be seized in the hand," is a pregnant construction for, "to fall into the hand and be held fast by it."
