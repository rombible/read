In obedience to this command, "Nebuzaradan, the chief of the body-guards, sent-and Nebushasban the head chamberlain, and Nergal-sharezer the chief magician, and all (the other) chief men of the king of Babylon-they sent and took Jeremiah out of the court of the prison, and delivered him over to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, to take him out to the house. Thus he dwelt among the people." - On the names of the Chaldean grandees, see on <a href="/jeremiah/39-3.htm">Jeremiah 39:3</a>. Instead of the chief chamberlain (&#1512;&#1489;&#1470;&#1505;&#1512;&#1497;&#1505;) Sarsechim, there is here named, as occupying this office, Nebushasban, who, it seems, along with Nebuzaradan, was not sent from Riblah till after the taking of Jerusalem, when Sarsechim was relieved.<p>We cannot come to any certain conclusion regarding the relation in which the two persons or names stand to one another, since Nebushasban is only mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-13.htm">Jeremiah 39:13</a>, just as Sarsechim is mentioned only in <a href="/jeremiah/39-3.htm">Jeremiah 39:3</a>. Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the man who had already on a former occasion given protection to Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/26-24.htm">Jeremiah 26:24</a>), was, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-5.htm">Jeremiah 40:5</a>, placed by the king of Babylon over the cities of Judah, i.e., was nominated the Chaldean governor over Judah and the Jews who were left in the land. To him, as such, Jeremiah is here (<a href="/jeremiah/39-14.htm">Jeremiah 39:14</a>) delivered, that he may take him into the house. &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; is neither the temple (Hitzig) nor the palace, the king's house (Graf), but the house in which Gedaliah resided as the governor; and we find here &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;, not &#1489;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1514;&#1493;, since the house was neither the property nor the permanent dwelling-place of Gedaliah. - According to this account, Jeremiah seems to have remained in the court of the prison till Nebuchadnezzar came, to have been liberated by Nebuzaradan only at the command of the king, and to have been sent to Gedaliah the governor. But this is contradicted by the account in <a href="/jeremiah/40-1.htm">Jeremiah 40:1</a>., according to which, Nebuzaradan liberated the prophet in Ramah, where he had been kept, confined by manacles, among the captives of Judah that were to be carried to Babylon: Nebuzaradan sent for him, and gave him his liberty. This contradiction has arisen simply from the intense brevity with which, in this verse, the fate of Jeremiah at the capture and destruction of Jerusalem is recorded; it is easy to settle the difference in this way: - When the city was taken, those inhabitants, especially males, who had not carried arms, were seized by the Chaldeans and carried out of the city to Ramah, where they were held prisoners till the decision of the king regarding their fate should be made known. Jeremiah shared this lot with his fellow-countrymen. When, after this, Nebuzaradan came to Jerusalem to execute the king's commands regarding the city and its inhabitants, at the special order of his monarch, he sent for Jeremiah the prophet, taking him out from among the crowd of prisoners who had been already carried away to Ramah, loosed him from his fetters, and gave him permission to choose his place of residence. This liberation of Jeremiah from his confinement might, in a summary account, be called a sending for him out of the court of the prison, even though the prophet, at the exact moment of his liberation, was no longer in the court of the prison of the palace at Jerusalem, but had been already carried away to Ramah as a captive. </body></html>
