The standard and the sound of the trumpet are, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-5.htm">Jeremiah 4:5</a>, the alarm-signals on the approach of the enemy.<p>There is no prospect of an end to the horrors, for (<a href="/jeremiah/4-22.htm">Jeremiah 4:22</a>) the people is so foolish that it understands only how to do the evil, but not the good; cf. for this <a href="/jeremiah/5-21.htm">Jeremiah 5:21</a>; <a href="/isaiah/1-3.htm">Isaiah 1:3</a>; <a href="/micah/7-3.htm">Micah 7:3</a>. <a href="/jeremiah/4-21.htm">Jeremiah 4:21</a> gives God's answer to the woful query, how long the ravaging of the land by war is to last. The answer is: as long as the people persists in the folly of its rebellion against God, so long will chastising judgments continue. To bring this answer of God home to the people's heart, the prophet, in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-23.htm">Jeremiah 4:23-26</a>, tells what he has seen in the spirit. He has seen (&#1512;&#1488;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497;, perf. proph.) bursting over Judah a visitation which convulses the whole world. The earth seemed waste and void as at the beginning of creation, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a>, before the separation of the elements and before the creation of organic and living beings. In heaven no light was to be seen, earth and heaven seemed to have been thrown back into a condition of chaos. The mountains and hills, these firm foundations of the earth, quivered and swayed (&#1492;&#1514;&#1511;&#1500;&#1511;&#1500;, be put into a light motion, cf. <a href="/nahum/1-5.htm">Nahum 1:5</a>); men had fled and hidden themselves from the wrath of God (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/2-19.htm">Isaiah 2:19</a>, <a href="/isaiah/2-21.htm">Isaiah 2:21</a>), and all the birds had flown out of sight in terror at the dreadful tokens of the beginning catastrophe (<a href="/genesis/9-9.htm">Genesis 9:9</a>). The fruitful field was the wilderness - not a wilderness, but "changed into the wilderness with all its attributes" (Hitz.). &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1502;&#1500; is not appell. as in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-7.htm">Jeremiah 2:7</a>, but nom. prop. of the lower slopes of Carmel, famed for their fruitfulness; these being taken as representatives of all the fruitful districts of the land. The cities of the Carmel, or of the fruitful-field, are manifestly not to be identified with the store cities of <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/9-19.htm">1 Kings 9:19</a>, as Hitz. supposes, but the cities in the most fertile districts of the country, which, by reason of their situation, were in a prosperous condition, but now are destroyed. "Before the heat of His anger," which is kindled against the foolish and godless race; cf. <a href="/nahum/1-6.htm">Nahum 1:6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/13-13.htm">Isaiah 13:13</a>.</body></html>
