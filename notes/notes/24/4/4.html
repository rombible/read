The subject of them all is the same, namely, the approaching devastation of Judaea by a hostile army in punishment of its persistence in idolatry. The prophecy of <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/7.htm">Jeremiah 7</a> was probably written in the first year of Jehoiakim, while as regards the rest they probably extended over a considerable period of time. This group, which we may reasonably believe to have come down to us much as it stood in Jehoiakim's scroll, gives us a general view of the nature of Jeremiah's efforts during that important period, when under Josiah a national reformation was still possible, and the exile might have been averted. The prophecy <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/7.htm">Jeremiah 7</a>, spoken in the first year of Jehoiakim, when the probation of Judah was virtually over, was the solemn closing of the appeal to the conscience of the people, and a protest, while the new king was still young upon his throne, against that ruinous course upon which he so immediately entered. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4.

Or, "be ye circumcised", as the Septuagint and Vulgate Latin versions render it. This is to be understood of the circumcision of the heart, as Kimchi observes; and as appears from the following words: <p>and take away the foreskins of your heart, ye men of Judah, and inhabitants of Jerusalem; this is the true spiritual circumcision; and they that are possessed of it are the circumcision, the only truly circumcised persons; and they are such who have been pricked to the heart, and thoroughly convinced of sin; who have had the hardness of their hearts removed, and the impurity of it laid open to them; which they have beheld with shame and loathing, and have felt an inward pain on account of it; and who have been enabled to deny themselves, to renounce their own righteousness, and put off the body of the sins of the flesh: and though men are exhorted to do this themselves, yet elsewhere the Lord promises to do it for them, <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-6.htm">Deuteronomy 30:6</a>, and indeed it is purely his own work; or otherwise it could not he called, as it is, "circumcision without hands", and "whose praise is not of man, but of God", <a href="//biblehub.com/colossians/2-11.htm">Colossians 2:11</a>, and the reason of this exhortation, as before, is to convince those Jews, who were circumcised in the flesh, and rested and gloried in that, that their hearts were not circumcised, and that there was a necessity of it, and they in danger for want of it; as follows: <p>lest my fury come forth like fire; to which the wrath of God is sometimes compared, <a href="/nahum/1-6.htm">Nahum 1:6</a> and is sometimes signified by a furnace and lake of fire, even his eternal wrath and vengeance: <p>and burn that none can quench it; such is the fire of divine wrath; it is unquenchable; it is everlasting, <a href="//biblehub.com/mark/9-43.htm">Mark 9:43</a>, <p>because of the evil of your doings; which are so provoking to the eyes of his glory; the sins of men are the fuel to the fire of his wrath, and cause it to burn to the lowest hell, without the least degree of mercy.

A significant passage. All the Jews were circumcised, but not all were "circumcised to the Lord." There were but too many who were "circumcised in uncircumcision" (<a href="/jeremiah/9-25.htm">Jeremiah 9:25</a>), and the prophet sternly reduces ouch circumcision to the level of the heathenish rite of cutting off the hair (<a href="/jeremiah/9-26.htm">Jeremiah 9:26</a>; comp. Herod. 3:8). Jeremiah seems to have been specially anxious to counteract a merely formal, ritualistic notion of circumcision, sharing in this, as in other points, the influence of the Book of Deuteronomy, so lately found in the temple (comp. <a href="/deuteronomy/10-16.htm">Deuteronomy 10:16</a>). To him the venerable rite of circumcision (older, certainly, than Abraham) is a symbol of the devotion of the heart to its rightful Lord (comp. St. Paul in <a href="/romans/2-28.htm">Romans 2:28, 29</a>; <a href="/colossians/2-11.htm">Colossians 2:11</a>; <a href="/philippians/3-3.htm">Philippians 3:3</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>From the false gods they have gained but disgrace; the salvation of Israel is found only in Jahveh their God. The thought now given is clearly expressed in the second clause of the verse; less clear is the meaning of the first clause, which tells what Israel had got from idolatry. The difficulty lies in &#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503; &#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, which the early commentators so joined together as to make &#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503; stat. constr. (&#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503;). Similarly Hitz. and Graf: from the hills the host (or tumult) of the mountains is (for) a delusion; Hitz. understanding by the host of the mountains the many gods, or the numerous statues of them that were erected at the spots where they were worshipped, while Graf takes the tumult of the mountains to mean the turmoil of the pilgrims, the exulting cries of the celebrants. But it is as impossible that "the sound of the hills" should mean the multitude of the gods, as that it should mean the tumult of the pilgrims upon the mountains. Besides, the expression, "the host or tumult of the mountains comes from the hills," would be singularly tautological. These reasons are enough to show that &#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; cannot be a genitive dependent on &#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503;, but must be taken as coordinate with &#1502;&#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514;, so that the preposition &#1502;&#1503; will have to be repeated before &#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;. But &#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503; must be the subject of the clause, else where would be no subject at all. &#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503; means bustle, eager crowd, tumult, noise, and is also used of the surging mass of earthly possessions or riches, <a href="/psalms/37-16.htm">Psalm 37:16</a>; <a href="/isaiah/60-5.htm">Isaiah 60:5</a>. Schnur., Ros., Maur., de W., have preferred the last meaning, and have put the sense thus: vana est ex collibus, vana ex montibus affluentia, or: delusive is the abundance that comes from the hills, from the mountains. This view is not to be overthrown by Graf's objection, that we cannot here entertain the idea of abundance, however, imaginary, acquired by the Israelites through idolatry, seeing that in the next verses it is declared that the false gods have devoured the wealth which the Israelites had inherited and received from God. For in the present connection the abundance would be not a real but expected or imagined abundance, the delusiveness of which would be shown in the next verse by the statement that the false gods had devoured the acquisitions of Israel. But to take &#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503; in the sense of affluentia seems questionable here, when the context makes no reference to wealth or earthly riches, and where the abundance of the hills and mountains cannot be understood to mean their produce; the abundance is that which the idolatry practised upon the hills and mountains brought or was expected to bring to the people. Hence, along with Ew., we take this word in the sig. tumult or noise, and by it we understand the wild uproarious orgies of idolatry, which, according to <a href="/jeremiah/3-2.htm">Jeremiah 3:2</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-6.htm">Jeremiah 3:6</a>, were practised on the hills and mountains (&#1511;&#1500; &#1494;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1492;&#1468;, <a href="/jeremiah/3-9.htm">Jeremiah 3:9</a>). Thus we obtain the sense already given by the Targ.: in vanum coluimus super collibus et non in utilitatem congregavimus nos (&#1488;&#1514;&#1512;&#1490;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1488; ( son , prop. tumultuati sumus) super montibus, i.e., delusive and profitless were our idolatrous observances upon the heights.</body></html>
