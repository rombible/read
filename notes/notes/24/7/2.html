None can claim an interest in free salvation, who allow themselves in the practice of known sin, or live in the neglect of known duty. They thought that the temple they profaned would be their protection. But all who continue in sin because grace has abounded, or that grace may abound, make Christ the minister of sin; and the cross of Christ, rightly understood, forms the most effectual remedy to such poisonous sentiments. The Son of God gave himself for our transgressions, to show the excellence of the Divine law, and the evil of sin.

As to "daughter of my people," cf. <a href="/jeremiah/4-11.htm">Jeremiah 4:11</a>; on "gird thee with sackcloth," cf. <a href="/jeremiah/4-8.htm">Jeremiah 4:8</a>. To bestrew the head with ashes is a mode of expressing the greatest affliction; cf. <a href="/ezekiel/27-30.htm">Ezekiel 27:30</a>; <a href="/micah/1-10.htm">Micah 1:10</a>. &#1488;&#1489;&#1500;  as in <a href="/amos/8-10.htm">Amos 8:10</a>; <a href="/zechariah/12-10.htm">Zechariah 12:10</a>.<p>The closing verses of this discourse (<a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-27.htm">Jeremiah 6:27-30</a>) are regarded by Hitz. as a meditation upon the results of his labours. "He was to try the people, and he found it to be evil." But in this he neglects the connection of these verses with the preceding. From the conclusion of <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-30.htm">Jeremiah 6:30</a>, "Jahveh hath rejected them," we may see that they stand connected in matter with the threatening of the spoiler; and the fact is put beyond a doubt when we compare together the greater subdivisions of the present discourse. The <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-27.htm">Jeremiah 6:27-30</a> correspond in substance with the view given in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-30.htm">Jeremiah 5:30-31</a> of the moral character of the people. As that statement shows the reasons for the threatening that God must take vengeance on such a people (<a href="/jeremiah/5-29.htm">Jeremiah 5:29</a>), so what is said in the verses before us explain why it is threatened that a people approaching from the north will execute judgment without mercy on the daughter of Zion. For these verses do not tell us only the results of the prophet's past labours, but they at the same time indicate that his further efforts will be without effect. The people is like copper and iron, unproductive of either gold or silver; and so the smelting process is in vain. The illustration and the thing illustrated are not strictly discriminated in the statement. &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1503; is adject. verb. with active force: he that tries metal, that by smelting separates the slag from the gold and silver ore; cf. <a href="/zechariah/13-9.htm">Zechariah 13:9</a>; <a href="/job/23-10.htm">Job 23:10</a>. &#1502;&#1489;&#1510;&#1512; creates a difficulty, and is very variously understood. The ancient comm. have interpreted it, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-18.htm">Jeremiah 1:18</a>, as either in a fortress, or as a fortress. So the Chald., changing &#1489;&#1495;&#1493;&#1503; for &#1489;&#1495;&#1493;&#1512;: electum dedi te in populo meo, in urbe munita forti. Jerome: datur propheta populo incredulo probator robustus, quod ebraice dicitur &#1502;&#1489;&#1510;&#1512;, quod vel munitum juxta Aquil., vel clausum atque circumdatum juxta Symm. et lxx sonat. The extant text of the lxx has &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;. Following the usage of the language, we are justified only in taking &#1502;&#1489;&#1510;&#1512; as apposition to &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1503;, or to the suffix in &#1504;&#1514;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1498;; in which case Luther's connection of it with &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;, "among my people, which is so hard," will appear to be impossible. But again, it has been objected, not without reason, that the reference of "fortress" to Jeremiah is here opposed to the context, while in <a href="/jeremiah/1-18.htm">Jeremiah 1:18</a> it falls well in with it; consequently other interpretations have been attempted. Gaab, Maur., Hitz., have taken note of the fact that &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1512; occurs in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/36-19.htm">Job 36:19</a>, like &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1512; in the signification of gold; they take &#1502;&#1489;&#1510;&#1512; as a contraction for &#1502;&#1503; &#1489;&#1510;&#1512;, and expound: without gold, i.e., although then was there no gold, to try for which was thy task. To this view Graf has objected: the testing would be wholly purposeless, if it was already declared beforehand that there was no noble metal in the people. But this objection is not conclusive; for the testing could only have as its aim to exhibit the real character of the people, so as to bring home to the people's apprehension what was already well known to God. These are weightier considerations: 1. We cannot make sure of the meaning gold-ore for &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1512; by means of <a href="//biblehub.com/job/36-19.htm">Job 36:19</a>, since the interpretation there is open to dispute; and &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1512;, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/22-24.htm">Job 22:24</a>, does not properly mean gold, but unworked ore, though in its connection with the context we must understand virgin gold and silver ore in its natural condition. Here, accordingly, we would be entitled to translate only: without virgin ore, native metal. 2. The choice of a word so unusual is singular, and the connection of &#1502;&#1489;&#1510;&#1512; with &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497; htiw  is still very harsh. Yet less satisfactory is the emendation defended by J. D. Mich., Dahl, Ew., and Graf, &#1502;&#1489;&#1510;&#1468;&#1512;: "for a trier have I made thee among my people, for a separater;" for &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1512; has in Heb. only the meaning cut off and fortify, and the Pi. occurs in <a href="/isaiah/22-10.htm">Isaiah 22:10</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/51-53.htm">Jeremiah 51:53</a> in the latter meaning, whereas the signif. separate, discriminate, can be maintained neither from Hebrew nor Arabic usage. The case being so, it seems to us that the interpretation acc. to <a href="/jeremiah/1-18.htm">Jeremiah 1:18</a> has most to be said for it: To be a trier have I set thee amid my people "as a strong tower;" and to this Ges., Dietr. in Lex. s.v., adhere. </body></html>
