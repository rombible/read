They are, however, rightly understood, strictly in harmony with the facts. They were not the end contemplated. The first promulgation of the Law, the basis of the covenant with Israel, contemplated a spiritual, ethical religion, of which the basis was found in the ten great Words, or commandments, of Exodus 20. The ritual in connection with sacrifice was prescribed partly as a concession to the feeling which showed itself, in its evil form, in the worship of the golden calf, partly as an education. The book of Deuteronomy, representing the higher truth from which Moses started (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm" title="Now therefore, if you will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then you shall be a peculiar treasure to me above all people: for all the earth is mine:">Exodus 19:5</a>), and upon which he at last fell back, bore its witness to the original purport of the Law (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-3.htm" title="Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do it; that it may be well with you, and that you may increase mightily, as the LORD God of your fathers has promised you, in the land that flows with milk and honey.">Deuteronomy 6:3</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/10-12.htm" title="And now, Israel, what does the LORD your God require of you, but to fear the LORD your God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul,">Deuteronomy 10:12</a>). Its re-discovery under Josiah left, here as elsewhere, its impress on the mind of Jeremiah; but prophets, as in <a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm" title="And Samuel said, Has the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to listen than the fat of rams.">1Samuel 15:22</a>; <a href="/hosea/6-6.htm" title="For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.">Hosea 6:6</a>; <a href="/context/hosea/8-11.htm" title="Because Ephraim has made many altars to sin, altars shall be to him to sin.">Hosea 8:11-13</a>; <a href="/context/amos/5-21.htm" title="I hate, I despise your feast days, and I will not smell in your solemn assemblies.">Amos 5:21-27</a>; <a href="/context/micah/6-6.htm" title="With which shall I come before the LORD, and bow myself before the high God? shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves of a year old?">Micah 6:6-8</a>; Psalms 50, 51, had all along borne a like witness, even while recognising to the full the fact and the importance of a sacrificial ritual.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:21-28 God shows that obedience was required of them. That which God commanded was, Hearken diligently to the voice of the Lord thy God. The promise is very encouraging. Let God's will be your rule, and his favour shall be your happiness. God was displeased with disobedience.

Acid burnt-offering to peace-offerings. All is in vain as long as you neglect the indispensable requirements of obedience and moral purity. Eat flesh is equivalent to sacrifice. The flesh of animals offered in sacrifice was usually eaten by the offerers, and this meal was regarded as a symbol of reconciliation. God and man partook of the same victim, and so were made friends. This passage <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-21.htm">Jeremiah 7:21-28</a> is the Haphtarah (lesson) from the prophets, after the Parashah, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/6.htm">Leviticus 6-8</a>, or Lesson from the Law. The selection of such a Haphtarah shows that the Jews thoroughly understood that their sacrifices were not the end of the Law, but a means for spiritual instruction. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22. Not contradicting the divine obligation of the legal sacrifices. But, "I did not require sacrifices, unless combined with moral obedience" (Ps 50:8; 51:16, 17). The superior claim of the moral above the positive precepts of the law was marked by the ten commandments having been delivered first, and by the two tables of stone being deposited alone in the ark (De 5:6). The negative in Hebrew often supplies the want of the comparative: not excluding the thing denied, but only implying the prior claim of the thing set in opposition to it (Ho 6:6). "I will have mercy, and not sacrifice" (1Sa 15:22). Love to God is the supreme end, external observances only means towards that end. "The mere sacrifice was not so much what I commanded, as the sincere submission to My will gives to the sacrifice all its virtue" [Magee, Atonement, Note 57].<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Some would argue from hence that sacrifices were at first an invention of men, as papists and Socinians; and because they should not be used to idols, God gave way for the introducing them into his worship; but it is evident in Scripture that they have been of Divine institution ever since Adam, <span class="bld"><a href="/genesis/4-3.htm" title="And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering to the LORD.">Genesis 4:3</a>,4</span>.

The passage is of the highest importance in its bearing on the epochs at which the different parts of the Pentateuch were severally composed. It is now held to be made up from elements of very diverse dates. Careful examination has shewn that in Jeremiah’s day the “Priestly Code” (P) which emphasizes and elaborates the sacrificial ritual had not been added to the earlier constituents (J and E). It is true indeed that those earlier constituents are not devoid of reference to sacrifice (see <a href="/context/exodus/23-14.htm" title="Three times you shall keep a feast to me in the year....">Exodus 23:14-19</a>), nor is Deut. either (e.g. <a href="/jeremiah/12-5.htm" title="If you have run with the footmen, and they have wearied you, then how can you contend with horses? and if in the land of peace, wherein you trusted, they wearied you, then how will you do in the swelling of Jordan?">Jeremiah 12:5</a> ff., <a href="/jeremiah/16-1.htm" title="The word of the LORD came also to me, saying,">Jeremiah 16:1</a> ff.), but (in Peake’s words) “there is a very marked difference between the attitude of the earlier Codes and the Priestly Legislation. In the latter the ritual system is of very high importance, and sacrifice fills a prominent place, in the former sacrifice holds a relatively insignificant position.” See further on <a href="/jeremiah/8-8.htm" title="How do you say, We are wise, and the law of the LORD is with us? See, certainly in vain made he it; the pen of the scribes is in vain.">Jeremiah 8:8</a> as to Jeremiah’s view.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In general it may be said that obedience to the moral law always ranked first (cp. <a href="/jeremiah/11-4.htm" title="Which I commanded your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, from the iron furnace, saying, Obey my voice, and do them, according to all which I command you: so shall you be my people, and I will be your God:">Jeremiah 11:4</a>), and sacrifices were, as is here taught, wholly worthless when offered by the immoral. Moreover, the “outward ceremonial of sacrifice is discounted, in view of the danger of dependence on it” (Buchanan Blake, <span class="ital">How to read the Prophets</span>, Part I. p. 222). For the relation between prophecy and the ritual law, see further in C. B. <span class="ital">Introd. to the Pentateuch</span>, pp. 174–181. The Jews (it may be added) read in their services this portion of the prophets as the <span class="ital">Haph tarah</span> (2nd Lesson) in connexion with Leviticus 6-8. (as 1st Lesson), thus supporting the view that sacrifices are but secondary.

The prophet here appears to deny <span class="accented">in tote</span> that Jehovah at Mount Sinai had given any injunctions on the subject of sacrifice. But the prophet must at any rate be consistent with himself; he cannot utter anything by Divine command which is fundamentally at variance with other equally authoritative declarations. Do the statements of Jeremiah elsewhere justify us in accepting <span class="accented">the</span> words in their literal, superficial meaning? There are three other passages which have a claim to be considered. In <a href="/jeremiah/17-26.htm">Jeremiah 17:26</a> the prophet draws a picture of the happy condition in which the Jews might be, were they only obedient. One of the features of this picture is that the Jews would still bring all the various kinds of sacrifices to the house of Jehovah. In <a href="/jeremiah/31-14.htm">Jeremiah 31:14</a> a similar description is closed with the promise to "satiate the soul of the priests with fatness," implying that there would be a great abundance of thank offerings in regenerate Israel. In <a href="/jeremiah/33-11.htm">Jeremiah 33:11</a>, among other blessings of the future, the prophet mentions the praiseful exclamations of those who would bring the sacrifice of thanksgiving. These passages do not contain any statement respecting the origin of the sacrificial system; but they do expressly assert that Jehovah contemplates that system with pleasure, and apparently that he designs it to be permanent among his people Israel. Let us now turn to <a href="/jeremiah/33-17.htm">Jeremiah 33:17-24</a>. Here the prophet, in the Name of Jehovah, declares that there is a Divine covenant "with the Levites, the priests," who shall never "want a man before me... to do sacrifice continually." A covenant with the priests implies a covenant with the people, the priests being the representatives of the people. This passage, therefore, is more distinct than those previously quoted; it does appear to maintain that the range of the Sinaitic covenant included the duties of the priesthood, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. sacrifices. On the other hand, it should be observed that the genuineness of this latter passage is not beyond dispute, the whole section in which it occurs (<a href="/jeremiah/33-14.htm">Jeremiah 33:14-26</a>) being omitted in the Septuagint. We have now to inquire, Is there a real discrepancy between the words of Jeremiah (strictly speaking, of Jehovah) in the verse now before us, interpreted literally, and the passages adduced above? Are they more inconsistent than such an utterance as <a href="/jeremiah/6-20.htm">Jeremiah 6:20</a> (first half of verse), which appears to deny the utility of sacrifices altogether? If the latter may be explained as a forcible oratorical exaggeration, why not also the present passage? Jeremiah sees the people attaching a pernicious importance to the opus <span class="accented">operatum</span> of sacrifice. On one occasion he tells them that Jehovah cares not for sacrifices; he means, as the context shows, the sacrifices of men without spiritual sensibilities. On another, that Jehovah never commanded their fathers to sacrifice; he means (may we not presume?) the mere outward forms of the ritual, divorced from the sentiment and practice of piety, which, as Hosea tells us (<a href="/hosea/6-6.htm">Hosea 6:6</a>), Jehovah "delights in and not [equivalent to 'more than'] sacrifice." There is, therefore, no fundamental inconsistency between the passage before us and the three passages first quoted, and if so there can be no real discrepancy with the last-mentioned passage, for the priests (as was remarked) perform their functions on behalf of the people, and the permanence of Jehovah's covenant with the priests depended on the spiritual life of the people they represented (read <a href="/jeremiah/33.htm">Jeremiah 33</a>, as a whole). This view seems less arbitrary than that of Ewald, who thinks that the sacrifices spoken of in our passage are merely the free-will offerings of the rich; and than that of Dahler, who interprets, "My chief care was not to prescribe rules for holocausts and sacrifices, but this is what I commanded thee above all," viz. moral obedience. According to it, the prophet's denial is not absolute, but relative - relative, that is, to the notion of sacrifices entertained by the Jews whom he addresses. Of course, Graf's view, that the denial is absolute, will equally well suit the context. The people were surprised at Jeremiah's objurgations, because they thought they had fulfilled the claims of the covenant. Jeremiah's purpose is equally well fulfilled whether his denial is qualified or unqualified, absolute or relative. Our object has been to separate the exegesis of our passage from a still doubtful controversy, and to offer a tenable view of it, based upon grounds purely internal to Jeremiah. It may be suggested, however, to the student of Leviticus, that even if the Levitical legislation in its present form were proved to be of a pest-Exile date, it would still be doubtful whether any believing temple-worshipper could help assuming that Jehovah had, from the first existence of the nation, given his direct sanction to the offering of sacrifices. If so, it is comparatively unimportant (except with regard to the progressive revelation of the strictness of the law of truth) whether the Levitical code was given to Moses at Mount Sinai in its present form or not. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>This punishment will be turned aside, neither by intercession, because the people re2fuses to give up its idolatry, nor by sacrifice, which God desires not, because for long they have turned to Him the back and not the face, and have not hearkened to His words. - <a href="/jeremiah/7-16.htm">Jeremiah 7:16</a>.

Thus speak to them: This is the people that hearken not unto the voice of Jahveh its God, and that receive not correction. Perished is faithfulness, cut off from their mouth."<p>The purport of <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-16.htm">Jeremiah 7:16</a>, that God will not suffer Himself to be moved by any entreaties to revoke the doom pronounced on the wicked people, is expressed by way of a command from God to the prophet not to pray for the people. That Jeremiah did sometimes pray thus, however, we see from <a href="/jeremiah/14-19.htm">Jeremiah 14:19</a>. (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/18-20.htm">Jeremiah 18:20</a>), when to his prayer the same answer is given as we have here, and all intercession for the corrupt race is characterized as in vain. The second clause: lift not up for them crying, i.e., supplicatory prayer, expresses the same, only more strongly; while the third clause: urge me not, cuts off all hope of success from even the most importunate intercession. The reason for this command to desist is shown in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-17.htm">Jeremiah 7:17</a>, by a reference to the idolatry which was openly practised throughout the land by young and old, men and women. Each takes part according to strength and capacity: the sons gather wood together, the fathers set the fire in order, etc. The deity so zealously worshipped by the people is called the Queen of heaven, and is mentioned only by Jeremiah. Besides here, there is reference to her in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-17.htm">Jeremiah 44:17</a>, where we see that her worship was very diligently cultivated, and that she was adored as the bestower of earthly possessions. (&#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1514; is stat. constr., either from the Chald. form &#1502;&#1500;&#1498;, or from &#1502;&#1500;&#1497;&#1499;&#1492;, after the analogy of &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1514;, st. constr. of &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1512;&#1492;; but perhaps it has &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1514; in stat. abs.) This worship was combined with that of the stars, the host of heaven, which especially prevailed under Manasseh (<a href="/2_kings/21-5.htm">2 Kings 21:5</a>). Thence it may be presumed that the Queen of heaven was one of the deities who came to Western Asia with the Assyrians, and that she corresponds to the Assyrian-Persian Tanais and Artemis, who in the course of time took the place once occupied by the closely related Phoenician Astarte. She is originally a deification of the moon, the Assyrian Selene and Virgo caelestis, who, as supreme female deity, was companion to Baal-Moloch as sun-god; cf. Movers, Phnizier, i. S. 623ff. With this accords the statement of Steph. Byz., that &#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7; is also &#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b9; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c9; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;. The offerings which, acc. to this verse and <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-19.htm">Jeremiah 44:19</a>, were brought to her, are called &#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, a word which would appear to have come to the Hebrews along with the foreign cultus. By the lxx it was Grecized into &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;, for which we find in glossators and codd. &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; and &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;. They were, acc. to the Etymol. magn. and Suidas, &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#837; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2; or &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1; &#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; (? cooked vegetables); acc. to Jerome, &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;, quas nos placentas interpretati sumus. In any case, they were some kind of sacrificial cakes, which Vitr. put alongside of the &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1; of Aristophanes and Lucian; cf. the various interpretations in Schleussner, Lexic. in lxx s.v. &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bd;. These cakes were kindled on the altar (cf. &#1502;&#1511;&#1496;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="/jeremiah/44-19.htm">Jeremiah 44:19</a>) as a kind of Minchah (meat-offering), and with this Minchah a libation or drink-offering (&#1504;&#1505;&#1499;&#1497;&#1501;) was combined. &#1492;&#1505;&#1468;&#1498; corresponds to &#1500;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1514;, so that &#1500; has to be repeated; cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-19.htm">Jeremiah 44:19</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-25.htm">Jeremiah 44:25</a>, where we find libations poured out to the Queen of heaven. In the 18th verse the expression is generalized into "other gods," with reference to the fact that the service of the Queen of heaven was but one kind of idolatry along with others, since other strange gods were worshipped by sacrifices and libations. To provoke me; cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/31-29.htm">Deuteronomy 31:29</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-16.htm">Deuteronomy 32:16</a>, etc. </body></html>
