Nothing but a universal reformation, which God foresaw would not take place, could preserve the Jews from that captivity and desolation which he had threatened to bring upon them. This decree of God to destroy them, unless they repented and were reformed, being irrevocable, the prophet is forbid to interpose by his prayers for the reversing of it. But still he might beseech God not to proceed to an utter destruction of his people, but, in remembrance of his covenant with Abraham and his seed, might spare a remnant, and accordingly we find he did pray to that effect, <a href="/context/jeremiah/14-7.htm" title="O LORD, though our iniquities testify against us, do you it for your name's sake: for our backslidings are many; we have sinned against you....">Jeremiah 14:7-9</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:1-16 No observances, professions, or supposed revelations, will profit, if men do not amend their ways and their doings. None can claim an interest in free salvation, who allow themselves in the practice of known sin, or live in the neglect of known duty. They thought that the temple they profaned would be their protection. But all who continue in sin because grace has abounded, or that grace may abound, make Christ the minister of sin; and the cross of Christ, rightly understood, forms the most effectual remedy to such poisonous sentiments. The Son of God gave himself for our transgressions, to show the excellence of the Divine law, and the evil of sin.

This charge seems to be laid upon the prophet, partly to take off the envy of the people from him, when they knew he was commanded to do no otherwise; partly to embolden him in this unpleasing work, laying aside all compassion. But certainly the prophet did pray that God would mind his covenant in saving a remnant, though not that God would revoke his decree, and to save the body of them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Therefore pray not thou for this people,.... These are the words of the Lord to the Prophet Jeremiah, forbidding him to pray for the people of the Jews; which he either was doing, or about to do, and which, from the great affection he had for them, he was inclined unto; wherefore, to show how much the Lord was displeased with them, and how determined he was to punish them with captivity, he orders the prophet not to make any supplication for them: <p>neither lift up cry nor prayer for them; referring to the gestures of lifting up the eyes and hands in prayer, and also to the frame of the heart, in the exercise of faith and holy confidence: "cry" and "prayer" are put together, because prayer is sometimes made, especially when persons are in great distress, with strong cryings and tears; see <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/5-7.htm">Hebrews 5:7</a>, <p>neither make intercession to me; or, "meet me" (o); or come between him and this people, and so act the part of a mediator, of which office intercession is a branch; it properly belongs to Christ. The Jews say (p) there is no  "meeting", but prayer, or that is always intended by it; for proof of which they cite this passage: <p>for I will not hear thee; on the behalf of them, being so highly provoked by them, and determined they should go into captivity; see <a href="/jeremiah/15-1.htm">Jeremiah 15:1</a>. <p>(o)   "et ne oecurras mihi", Calvin; "et ne obsistas mihi", V.

It is hardly probable that this formed part of Jeremiah’s address, seeing that it gives us in fact Jehovah’s words to His prophet abruptly inserted, without any introductory formula. According to some commentators, e.g. Co., the kind of idolatry here spoken of was not practised as late as Jehoiakim’s reign. It is mentioned, however, in <a href="/jeremiah/19-13.htm" title="And the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses of the kings of Judah, shall be defiled as the place of Tophet, because of all the houses on whose roofs they have burned incense to all the host of heaven, and have poured out drink offerings to other gods.">Jeremiah 19:13</a>, which may belong to that date. It is true that in ch. 44 the people ascribe their misfortunes to the neglect of it, but it is a question whether the women who there speak are not contrasting their present with <span class="ital">their own</span> past practice and not with that of a previous generation. Jeremiah’s tone of hopelessness also points in the direction of the later period, rather than in that of Josiah’s reforms.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 16-20.</span> - The hypocrisy of the worship of Jehovah proved; its punishment. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Pray not thou for this people</span>.

The phrase, other gods, points to the first commandment, <a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>; and the relative clause: whom ye knew not, stands in opposition to: I am Jahveh your God, who hath brought you out of Egypt.
