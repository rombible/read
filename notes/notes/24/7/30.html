Concerning this unnatural and cruel custom of burning their children, by way of sacrifice to Moloch, which was derived from the Canaanites, see notes on <a href="/leviticus/18-21.htm" title="And you shall not let any of your seed pass through the fire to Molech, neither shall you profane the name of your God: I am the LORD.">Leviticus 18:21</a>; <a href="/2_kings/23-10.htm" title="And he defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the children of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech.">2 Kings 23:10</a>; <a href="/isaiah/30-33.htm" title="For Tophet is ordained of old; yes, for the king it is prepared; he has made it deep and large: the pile thereof is fire and much wood; the breath of the LORD, like a stream of brimstone, does kindle it.">Isaiah 30:33</a>. <span class="ital">Which I commanded them not </span>— But, on the contrary, expressed the greatest detestation of it, and forbade it under the severest penalties: see <a href="/context/leviticus/20-1.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,...">Leviticus 20:1-5</a>. The words are spoken by the figure called <span class="ital">meiosis, </span>by which a great deal less is expressed than is implied; a way of speaking frequent in Scripture. Thus, <a href="/deuteronomy/17-3.htm" title="And has gone and served other gods, and worshipped them, either the sun, or moon, or any of the host of heaven, which I have not commanded;">Deuteronomy 17:3</a>, God, speaking of the worship of the host of heaven, adds, <span class="ital">Which I have not commanded, </span>meaning, which I expressly forbade. So God, reproving the idolatry of the Jews, says, <a href="/isaiah/65-12.htm" title="Therefore will I number you to the sword, and you shall all bow down to the slaughter: because when I called, you did not answer; when I spoke, you did not hear; but did evil before my eyes, and did choose that wherein I delighted not.">Isaiah 65:12</a>, <span class="ital">They choose things wherein I delighted not, </span>that is, which I utterly abhorred.

The heart is the place in which God has chosen to put his name; but if sin has the innermost and uppermost place there, we pollute the temple of the Lord. The destruction of Jerusalem appears here very terrible. The slain shall be many; they having made it the place of their sin. Evil pursues sinners, even after death. Those who will not, by the grace of God, be cured of vain mirth, shall, by the justice of God, be deprived of all mirth.
