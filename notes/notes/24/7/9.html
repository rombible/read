None can claim an interest in free salvation, who allow themselves in the practice of known sin, or live in the neglect of known duty. They thought that the temple they profaned would be their protection. But all who continue in sin because grace has abounded, or that grace may abound, make Christ the minister of sin; and the cross of Christ, rightly understood, forms the most effectual remedy to such poisonous sentiments. The Son of God gave himself for our transgressions, to show the excellence of the Divine law, and the evil of sin.

At the same time they offered sacrifices, and trusted in them, they did those things, which would not be grateful to the Lord, nor profitable to them; or, "ye do steal", &amp;c.; so the Septuagint, and all the Oriental versions; and likewise the Targum; as charging them with them; these are sins against the second table of the law, as what follow are against the first: <p>and burn incense to Baal, and walk after other gods whom ye know not; for they not only burnt incense to Baal, which was an act of idolatrous worship; but served other strange gods they had not known before; whose names they had never heard of, and of whose help and assistance they now had no experience, nor received any benefit from, as they had on the one and only true God; and therefore it was great folly and ingratitude in them to forsake the Lord, and walk after these. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Will ye steal, murder, and commit adultery, and swear falsely, and burn incense unto Baal, and walk after other gods whom ye know not;</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/7.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">9</span>. <span class="ital">Will ye steal</span>] <span class="bld">What! steal</span>, etc. The Hebrew verb is in a form used when the object is to present the action itself in the strongest light.

The Hebrew word has no connexion with that for frankincense (<a href="/jeremiah/6-20.htm" title="To what purpose comes there to me incense from Sheba, and the sweet cane from a far country? your burnt offerings are not acceptable, nor your sacrifices sweet to me.">Jeremiah 6:20</a>), but denotes something producing a sweet smoke, whether sacrifices (as in <a href="/psalms/66-15.htm" title="I will offer to you burnt sacrifices of fatted calves, with the incense of rams; I will offer bullocks with goats. Selah.">Psalm 66:15</a>) or incense (as <a href="/exodus/30-7.htm" title="And Aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense every morning: when he dresses the lamps, he shall burn incense on it.">Exodus 30:7</a> f.).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Baal</span>] the Baal.

The "ways" mean the tendency of life at large, the "doings" are the individual manifestations of that tendency; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/18-11.htm">Jeremiah 18:11</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/26-13.htm">Jeremiah 26:13</a>. "In this place," i.e., in the land that I have given to your fathers; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/7-8.htm">Jeremiah 7:8</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/14-13.htm">Jeremiah 14:13</a> with <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-15.htm">Jeremiah 7:15</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-5.htm">Jeremiah 24:5-6</a>. Positive exhortation to a pure life is followed by negative dehortation from putting trust in the illusion: The temple, etc. The threefold repetition of the same word is the most marked way of laying very great emphasis upon it; cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-29.htm">Jeremiah 22:29</a>, <a href="/isaiah/6-3.htm">Isaiah 6:3</a>. "These," these halls, the whole complex mass of buildings (Hitz.), as in <a href="/2_chronicles/8-11.htm">2 Chronicles 8:11</a>; and here &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; has the force of the neuter; cf. Ew. 318, b. The meaning of this emphatic way of mentioning the temple of the Lord is, in this connection, the following: Jerusalem cannot be destroyed by enemies, because the Lord has consecrated for the abode of His name that temple which is in Jerusalem; for the Lord will not give His sanctuary, the seat of His throne, to be a prey to the heathen, but will defend it, and under its protection we too may dwell safely. In the temple of the Lord we have a sure pledge for unbroken possession of the land and the maintenance of the kingdom. Cf. the like discourse in <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/3-11.htm">Micah 3:11</a>, "Jahveh is in our midst, upon us none evil can come." This passage likewise shows that the "lying words" quoted are the sayings of the false prophets, whereby they confirmed the people in their secure sinfulness; the mass of the people at the same time so making these sayings their own as to lull themselves into the sense of security.</body></html>
