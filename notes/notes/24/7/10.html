The people tried to combine the worship of Baal and Jehovah, and passed from the one temple to the other. They went away from the fast or feast in the house of the Lord with the feeling that they were “saved,” or “delivered.” They had gone through their religious duties, and might claim their reward. The prophet seems to repeat their words in a tone of irony, They were “delivered,” not <span class= "ital">from </span>their abominations, but as if set free to do them.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:1-16 No observances, professions, or supposed revelations, will profit, if men do not amend their ways and their doings. None can claim an interest in free salvation, who allow themselves in the practice of known sin, or live in the neglect of known duty. They thought that the temple they profaned would be their protection. But all who continue in sin because grace has abounded, or that grace may abound, make Christ the minister of sin; and the cross of Christ, rightly understood, forms the most effectual remedy to such poisonous sentiments. The Son of God gave himself for our transgressions, to show the excellence of the Divine law, and the evil of sin. Never let us think we may do wickedness without suffering for it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>We are delivered - Jeremiah accuses them of trusting in the ceremonial of the temple instead of leading holy lives.

These words are not to be connected with "we are delivered," but thus: "Is it with this design that ye come and stand before Me in this house," in order that having offered your worthless sacrifices ye may be taken into My favor and so do all these abominations (Jer 7:9) with impunity?

In the temple; this they did after they had been guilty of such immoralities and idolatry; thinking by their appearance there, and their performance of a few ceremonies, and offering of some sacrifices, that all were atoned for: or this denotes their impudence, that, after the commission of such notorious crimes, they should have the front to come into the house of God, and stand before him, as if they had never departed from him, and were his people, and the true worshippers of him: <p>which is called by my name; the temple of God, the house of God, the sanctuary of the Lord; and where his name was also called upon, being a house of prayer; or where prayer was made to the Lord: <p>and say, we are delivered; from the punishment of the above sins, by coming into the temple, and standing before the Lord in it; by calling on his name, and offering sacrifices, though with impure hearts and hands, and in a hypocritical way <p>to do all these abominations; before mentioned; theft, murder, adultery, perjury, and idolatry. The sense is, either we are delivered and freed from punishment, that we may do these things with impunity; this is the use we make of, and the inference we draw from, our deliverance from evil: or we are delivered, though we commit these abominations, and therefore in them: or, seeing we are delivered, therefore do we these things; not that they really said these words, but this was the language of their actions. The Syriac version is, "deliver us, while we commit all these sins". <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And come and stand before me in this house, which is called by my name, and say, We are delivered to do all these abominations?</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/7.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">10</span>. <span class="ital">called by my name</span>] in token of ownership.

It is best with R.V. to limit the people’s supposed utterance to these three words, and to make the clause that follows to be the prophet’s indignant and sarcastic retort.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And come</span>, etc.; rather, and <span class="accented">then ye come</span>, etc. <span class="cmt_word">We are delivered to do</span>, etc.; rather, <span class="accented">we have escaped</span>, <span class="accented">in order to do</span>, etc. To make the concluding words of the verse a part of the speech seems hardly fair to the Jews, who would certainly not proclaim that they had made their escape from the threatened judgment with the object of prosecuting abominable acts. Such a view, moreover, greatly weakens the force of the emphatic "We have escaped." "In order to do," etc., are the words of the prophet, who thus lays bare the secret intentions of these formal worshippers. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div><a href="/jeremiah/7-3.htm">Jeremiah 7:3</a> contains the central idea of the discourse: it is only morally good endeavours and deeds that give the people a sure title to a long lease of the land. &#1492;&#1497;&#1496;&#1497;&#1489; is not merely, amend one's conduct; but, make one's way good, i.e., lead a good life. The "ways" mean the tendency of life at large, the "doings" are the individual manifestations of that tendency; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/18-11.htm">Jeremiah 18:11</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/26-13.htm">Jeremiah 26:13</a>. "In this place," i.e., in the land that I have given to your fathers; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/7-8.htm">Jeremiah 7:8</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/14-13.htm">Jeremiah 14:13</a> with <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-15.htm">Jeremiah 7:15</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-5.htm">Jeremiah 24:5-6</a>. Positive exhortation to a pure life is followed by negative dehortation from putting trust in the illusion: The temple, etc. The threefold repetition of the same word is the most marked way of laying very great emphasis upon it; cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-29.htm">Jeremiah 22:29</a>, <a href="/isaiah/6-3.htm">Isaiah 6:3</a>. "These," these halls, the whole complex mass of buildings (Hitz.), as in <a href="/2_chronicles/8-11.htm">2 Chronicles 8:11</a>; and here &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; has the force of the neuter; cf. Ew. 318, b. The meaning of this emphatic way of mentioning the temple of the Lord is, in this connection, the following: Jerusalem cannot be destroyed by enemies, because the Lord has consecrated for the abode of His name that temple which is in Jerusalem; for the Lord will not give His sanctuary, the seat of His throne, to be a prey to the heathen, but will defend it, and under its protection we too may dwell safely. In the temple of the Lord we have a sure pledge for unbroken possession of the land and the maintenance of the kingdom. Cf. the like discourse in <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/3-11.htm">Micah 3:11</a>, "Jahveh is in our midst, upon us none evil can come." This passage likewise shows that the "lying words" quoted are the sayings of the false prophets, whereby they confirmed the people in their secure sinfulness; the mass of the people at the same time so making these sayings their own as to lull themselves into the sense of security.</body></html>
