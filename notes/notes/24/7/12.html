It was during this period that the Israelites, as a punishment of the iniquitous and scandalous lives of the priests and people, received that signal defeat from the Philistines, when the ark of God was taken, as related <a href="/1_samuel/4-10.htm" title="And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled every man into his tent: and there was a very great slaughter; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen.">1 Samuel 4:10</a>, &c., the pathetic description of which disaster, given by the psalmist, <a href="/context/psalms/78-60.htm" title="So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men;...">Psalm 78:60-64</a>, has caused it to be generally believed, that an allusion to it was likewise designed here by Jeremiah. “But a due consideration of the context,” Blaney thinks, “will lead us rather to conclude that the prophet refers to a more recent event, the vestiges of which were still fresh to be seen. Shiloh was in the tribe of Ephraim, and this place, once so favoured and sanctified by God’s particular residence, had shared the fate of the rest of the kingdom of Israel, and was become a scene of misery and ruin.

But as God spared not Shiloh, but made it the victim of his wrath, so he says he would do to Jerusalem and her temple; and would cast off Judah for their wickedness from being his people, in like manner as he had already cast off their brethren, whom he distinguishes by the name of the children of Ephraim.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:1-16 No observances, professions, or supposed revelations, will profit, if men do not amend their ways and their doings. None can claim an interest in free salvation, who allow themselves in the practice of known sin, or live in the neglect of known duty. They thought that the temple they profaned would be their protection. But all who continue in sin because grace has abounded, or that grace may abound, make Christ the minister of sin; and the cross of Christ, rightly understood, forms the most effectual remedy to such poisonous sentiments. The Son of God gave himself for our transgressions, to show the excellence of the Divine law, and the evil of sin.

At any rate thenceforward Shiloh was a place of insignificance. In Jeremiah’s time it existed as a village (ch. <a href="/jeremiah/41-5.htm" title="That there came certain from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, even fourscore men, having their beards shaven, and their clothes rent, and having cut themselves, with offerings and incense in their hand, to bring them to the house of the LORD.">Jeremiah 41:5</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">12–15</span>.

Jeremiah attacks this false confidence in the temple of Jerusalem, by pointing to the destruction of an earlier sanctuary, of which very little is known, indeed only so much as to give an edge to our desire for more. It is certain, from <a href="/joshua/18-1.htm">Joshua 18:1</a> and <a href="/1_samuel/4-3.htm">1 Samuel 4:3</a>, that the tabernacle and the ark found a resting-place at Shiloh (an Ephraimitish town to the north of Bethel), nearly the whole of the period of the judges, or more exactly between the latter days of Joshua (<a href="/joshua/18-1.htm">Joshua 18:1</a>) and the death of Eli (<a href="/1_samuel/4-3.htm">1 Samuel 4:3</a>). Manifestly, then, there must have been some sort of "house," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. temple, at Shiloh; a mere tent would not have been sufficient for so long a period. This presumption is confirmed by the language of Jeremiah, and by the expressions of the narrative books. The fate which the prophet is bidden to announce for the existing temple is analogous to that which fell upon "Jehovah's place in Shiloh." The latter was, therefore, not merely a deportation of the ark, such as is referred to in <a href="/1_samuel/5.htm">1 Samuel 5</a>. And when the narrator of the times of Samuel speaks of Eli as "sitting by the door-post of the temple of Jehovah" (<a href="/1_samuel/1-9.htm">1 Samuel 1:9</a>), is it more natural to suppose t the word "temple" is here applied to the tabernacle, or that there was really a house, however rude, as sacred in the eyes of the faithful as was afterwards the splendid temple at Jerusalem? The latter view is strongly confirmed by <a href="/judges/18-31.htm">Judges 18:31</a>, "All the time that the house of God in Shiloh existed" (Authorized Version is misleading), and <a href="/judges/19-18.htm">Judges 19:18</a>, where the Levite travelling to Mount Ephraim says, "I am going to the house of Jehovah." It is no doubt strange at first sight that so little information is given us as to this central sanctuary of the true religion; but are there not other omissions (especially in the history of the judges), which are equally strange as long as we look upon the Old Testament as primarily an historical document? We do know something, however, and more than is generally suspected; for when the right translation is restored in <a href="/judges/18-31.htm">Judges 18:31</a>, it follows, from a comparison of this and the preceding verse, that the temple of Shiloh was destroyed simultaneously with the captivity of the northern tribes. The impression produced by this emphatic announcement of Jeremiah is revealed to us by a later passage in his book (see <a href="/jeremiah/26.htm">Jeremiah 26</a>.). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Over against such sayings Jeremiah puts that which is the indispensable condition of continued sojourn in the land. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-5.htm">Jeremiah 7:5</a>, after a preceding negative clause, means: but on the contrary. This condition is a life morally good, that shall show itself in doing justice, in putting away all unrighteousness, and in giving up idolatry. With &#1488;&#1501; begins a list of the things that belong to the making of one's ways and doings good. The adjunct to &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;, right, "between the man and his neighbour," shows that the justice meant is that they should help one man to his rights against another. The law attached penalties to the oppression of those who needed protection - strangers, orphans, widows; cf. <a href="/exodus/22-21.htm">Exodus 22:21</a>., <a href="/deuteronomy/24-17.htm">Deuteronomy 24:17</a>., <a href="/jeremiah/27-19.htm">Jeremiah 27:19</a>; and the prophets often denounce the same; cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/1-17.htm">Isaiah 1:17</a>, <a href="/isaiah/1-23.htm">Isaiah 1:23</a>; <a href="/isaiah/10-2.htm">Isaiah 10:2</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/22-7.htm">Ezekiel 22:7</a>; <a href="/zechariah/7-10.htm">Zechariah 7:10</a>; <a href="/malachi/3-5.htm">Malachi 3:5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/94-6.htm">Psalm 94:6</a>, etc.  for '&#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1514; is noteworthy, but is not a simple equivalent for it. Like &#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#787; &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#769;, &#1499;&#787;&#1489; implies a deeper interest on the part of the speaker, and the sense here is: and ye be really determined not to shed innocent blood (cf. Ew. 320, b). Hitz.'s explanation, that &#1488;&#1500; is equal to &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1500;&#1488; or &#1488;&#1501; &#1500;&#1488;, and that it her resumes again the now remote &#1488;&#1501;, is overturned by the consideration that &#1488;&#1500; is not at the beginning of the clause; and there is not the slightest probability in Graf's view, that the &#1488;&#1500; must have come into the text through the copyist, who had in his mind the similar clause in <a href="/jeremiah/22-3.htm">Jeremiah 22:3</a>. Shedding innocent blood refers in part to judicial murders (condemnation of innocent persons), in part to violent attacks made by the kings on prophets and godly men, such as we hear of in Manasseh's case, <a href="/2_kings/21-16.htm">2 Kings 21:16</a>. In this place (<a href="/jeremiah/7-7.htm">Jeremiah 7:7</a>), i.e., first and foremost Jerusalem, the metropolis, where moral corruption had its chief seat; in a wider sense, however, it means the whole kingdom of Judah (<a href="/jeremiah/7-3.htm">Jeremiah 7:3</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/7-7.htm">Jeremiah 7:7</a>). "To your hurt" belongs to all the above-mentioned transgressions of the law; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/25-7.htm">Jeremiah 25:7</a>. "In the land," etc., explains "this place." "From eternity to eternity" is a rhetorically heightened expression for the promise given to the patriarchs, that God would give the land of Canaan to their posterity for an everlasting possession, <a href="/genesis/17-8.htm">Genesis 17:8</a>; although here it belongs not to the relative clause, "that I gave," but to the principal clause, "cause you to dwell," as in <a href="/exodus/32-13.htm">Exodus 32:13</a>.</body></html>
