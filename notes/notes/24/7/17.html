This intimates both that their sins were evident and could not be denied, and that the sinners were impudent and would not be reclaimed: they committed their wickedness even in the prophet’s presence and under his eye; he saw what they did, and yet they did it; which was an affront to his office, and to God, whose minister he was, and bid defiance to both. <span class="ital">The children gather wood </span>— Here God shows how busily they were employed, from the youngest to the oldest, for their idolatry. Every one in the family did something toward it. <span class="ital">To make cakes to the queen of heaven </span>— That is, the moon, either in an image, or in the original, or both.

The worship of the moon was much in use among the heathen nations, and, as appears from <a href="/context/jeremiah/44-17.htm" title="But we will certainly do whatever thing goes forth out of our own mouth, to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings to her, as we have done, we, and our fathers, our kings, and our princes, in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem: for then had we plenty of victuals, and were well, and saw no evil....">Jeremiah 44:17-19</a>, many of the Jews were so attached to it, that they could not be reclaimed from it: no, not when destruction had come upon their country for that and other species of idolatry. We may observe, that the word <span class="greekheb">מלכת</span>, here rendered <span class="ital">queen, </span>may signify <span class="ital">regency, </span>as Blaney translates it, and therefore may include <span class="ital">the whole host of heaven: </span>but <span class="ital">queen </span>is the more common and proper signification of the word, and most probably here means the <span class="ital">moon </span>only: they, however, worshipped the <span class="ital">sun </span>and <span class="ital">stars </span>also. <span class="ital">That they may provoke me to anger </span>— Which is the direct tendency of their sin, though they may not propose to themselves such an end in the committing it. <span class="ital">Do they provoke me to anger? </span>— Do they think to grieve me, and trouble my infinite and eternal mind, as if they could hurt me by their wickedness? They are deceived: I am without passion, and can be without their offerings. <span class="ital">Do they not provoke themselves, </span>&c. — Will they not themselves feel the hurt, and reap the fruits of their conduct? Will not the arrow which they shoot against heaven recoil upon their own guilty heads?

Let us be as diligent ourselves, and as careful to teach our children the truths of God, as many are to teach the mysteries of iniquity. The direct tendency of this sin is malice against God, but it will hurt themselves. And they shall find there is no escaping.
