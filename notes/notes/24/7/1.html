There is nothing in the discourse which absolutely fixes its date, but the description of idolatry, as prevalent, and, possibly, the reference to the presence of the Chaldæan invader in <a href="/jeremiah/8-16.htm" title="The snorting of his horses was heard from Dan: the whole land trembled at the sound of the neighing of his strong ones; for they are come, and have devoured the land, and all that is in it; the city, and those that dwell therein.">Jeremiah 8:16</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/10-22.htm" title="Behold, the noise of the bruit is come, and a great commotion out of the north country, to make the cities of Judah desolate, and a den of dragons.">Jeremiah 10:22</a>, fit in rather with the reign of Jehoiakim than with that of Josiah; and from the special reference to Shiloh in <a href="/jeremiah/26-6.htm" title="Then will I make this house like Shiloh, and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth.">Jeremiah 26:6</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/26-9.htm" title="Why have you prophesied in the name of the LORD, saying, This house shall be like Shiloh, and this city shall be desolate without an inhabitant? And all the people were gathered against Jeremiah in the house of the LORD.">Jeremiah 26:9</a>, as occurring in a prophecy delivered at the beginning of that reign, it was probably this discourse, or one like it, and delivered about the same time, that drew down that king’s displeasure (see <a href="/jeremiah/7-14.htm" title="Therefore will I do to this house, which is called by my name, wherein you trust, and to the place which I gave to you and to your fathers, as I have done to Shiloh.">Jeremiah 7:14</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/7.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/jeremiah/7-1.htm" title="The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,">Jeremiah 7:1</a></span>. <span class="ital">The word of the Lord, </span>&c. — The date of this new sermon is not precisely marked, but it is probable it was delivered not long after the preceding one, and on the following occasion. “Besides the prophets who were commissioned to announce the approaching calamities of Judah and Jerusalem, there were others who took upon themselves to flatter the people with opposite predictions. They taught them to look upon such threats as groundless, since God, they said, would have too much regard to his own honour, to suffer his temple to be profaned, and the seat of his holiness to be given up into the hand of strangers. Jeremiah is therefore commanded openly to reprove the falsehood of these assertions, and to show, by an example in point, that the sanctity of the place would afford no security to the guilty; but that God would assuredly do by his house at Jerusalem what he had done unto Shiloh; and cast the people of Judah out of his sight as he had already cast off the people of Israel for their wickedness.” — Blaney. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:1-16 No observances, professions, or supposed revelations, will profit, if men do not amend their ways and their doings. None can claim an interest in free salvation, who allow themselves in the practice of known sin, or live in the neglect of known duty. They thought that the temple they profaned would be their protection. But all who continue in sin because grace has abounded, or that grace may abound, make Christ the minister of sin; and the cross of Christ, rightly understood, forms the most effectual remedy to such poisonous sentiments. The Son of God gave himself for our transgressions, to show the excellence of the Divine law, and the evil of sin. Never let us think we may do wickedness without suffering for it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/7.htm">Jeremiah 7-10</a> he addresses the people as they flocked into Jerusalem from the country, to attend the solemn services in the temple upon a fastday.

A sanctuary long polluted by immorality must inevitably be destroyed <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-2.htm">Jeremiah 7:2-8:3</a>.<p>(2) complaints follow of a more general character, in which the growing wickedness of the nation and especially of the leaders is pointed out <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-4.htm">Jeremiah 8:4-9:24</a>.<p>(3) lastly the prophet shows the possibility of averting the evils impending upon the nation <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-25.htm">Jeremiah 9:25-10:25</a>.<p><a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-1.htm">Jeremiah 10:1-2</a>.

Rejected silver they call them, for Jahveh hath rejected them."<p>In <a href="/jeremiah/6-22.htm">Jeremiah 6:22</a> the stumbling-blocks of <a href="/jeremiah/6-21.htm">Jeremiah 6:21</a> are explained. At the end of this discourse yet again the invasion of the enemy from the far north is announced, cf. <a href="/jeremiah/4-13.htm">Jeremiah 4:13</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-15.htm">Jeremiah 5:15</a>, and its terribleness is portrayed with new colours. The farther the land is from which the enemy comes, the more strange and terrible he appears to the imagination. The farthest (hindmost) sides of the earth (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/25-32.htm">Jeremiah 25:32</a>) is only a heightening of the idea: land of the north, or of the far distance (<a href="/jeremiah/5-15.htm">Jeremiah 5:15</a>); in other words, the far uttermost north (cf. <a href="/isaiah/14-13.htm">Isaiah 14:13</a>). In this notice of their home, Hitz. finds a proof that the enemies were the Scythians, not the Chaldeans; since, acc. to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-6.htm">Ezekiel 38:6</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-15.htm">Ezekiel 38:15</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-2.htm">Ezekiel 39:2</a>, Gog, i.e., The Scythians, come "from the sides of the north." But "sides of the earth" is not a geographical term for any particular northern country, but only for very remote lands; and that the Chaldeans were reckoned as falling within this term, is shown by the passage <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-8.htm">Jeremiah 31:8</a>, according to which Israel is to be gathered again from the land of the north and from the sides of the earth. Here any connection with Scythia in "sides of the earth" is not to be thought of, since prophecy knows nothing of a captivity of Israel in Scythia, but regards Assur and Babylon alone as the lands of the exile of Israelites and Jews. As weapons of the enemy then are mentioned bows (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/4-29.htm">Jeremiah 4:29</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/5-16.htm">Jeremiah 5:16</a>), and the javelin or lance (&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1503;, not shield; see on <a href="/1_samuel/17-6.htm">1 Samuel 17:6</a>). It is cruel, knows no pity, and is so numerous and powerful, that its voice, i.e., the tumult of its approach, is like the roaring of the sea; cf. <a href="/isaiah/5-30.htm">Isaiah 5:30</a>; <a href="/isaiah/17-12.htm">Isaiah 17:12</a>. On horses they ride; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/4-13.htm">Jeremiah 4:13</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/8-16.htm">Jeremiah 8:16</a>; <a href="/habakkuk/1-8.htm">Habakkuk 1:8</a>. &#1506;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498; in the singular, answering to "cruel it is," points back to &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497; or &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; . is not for &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1488;&#1495;&#1491; (Ros.), but for &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1502;&#1500;&#1495;&#1502;&#1492;, cf. <a href="/1_samuel/17-33.htm">1 Samuel 17:33</a>; <a href="/isaiah/42-13.htm">Isaiah 42:13</a>; and the genitive is omitted only because of the &#1500;&#1502;&#1500;&#1495;&#1502;&#1492; coming immediately after (Graf). "Against thee" is dependent on &#1506;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498;: equipped as a warrior is equipped for the war, against the daughter of Zion. In <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-24.htm">Jeremiah 6:24-26</a> are set forth the terrors and the suspense which the appearance of the foe will spread abroad. In <a href="/jeremiah/6-24.htm">Jeremiah 6:24</a> the prophet, as a member of the people, gives utterance to its feelings. As to the sense, the clauses are to be connected thus: As soon as we hear the rumour of the people, i.e., of its approach, our hands become feeble through dread, all power to resist vanishes: cf. <a href="/isaiah/13-7.htm">Isaiah 13:7</a>; and for the metaphor of travail, <a href="/isaiah/13-8.htm">Isaiah 13:8</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/4-9.htm">Micah 4:9</a>, etc. In v. 28 the inhabitants of Jerusalem, personified as the daughter of Zion, are warned not to go forth of the city into the field or about the country, lest they fall into the enemies' hands and be put to death. &#1502;&#1490;&#1493;&#1512; &#1502;&#1505;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489;, often used by Jeremiah, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-3.htm">Jeremiah 20:3</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/20-10.htm">Jeremiah 20:10</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/46-5.htm">Jeremiah 46:5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-29.htm">Jeremiah 49:29</a>, and, as <a href="/jeremiah/20-10.htm">Jeremiah 20:10</a> shows, taken from <a href="/psalms/31-14.htm">Psalm 31:14</a>.
