The influence of Jeremiah’s teaching on later Jewish thought is shown by the fact that this very section of Jeremiah (<a href="/context/jeremiah/7-21.htm" title="Thus said the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Put your burnt offerings to your sacrifices, and eat flesh.">Jeremiah 7:21-28</a>) appears in the Synagogue ritual as the <span class= "ital">Haphtara, </span>or second lesson from the prophets, after Leviticus 6-8, as the <span class= "ital">Parashah, </span>or first lesson from the Law. The Synagogue worship, indeed, was, in the nature of the case, the result of the teaching of scribes and prophets rather than of priests, and therefore a witness for the spiritual truth symbolised in sacrifice, and not for the perpetuation of the symbol.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:21-28 God shows that obedience was required of them.

Provoke they me, saith Jahveh, not themselves, to the shaming of their face? <a href="/jeremiah/7-20.htm">Jeremiah 7:20</a>.

But this word commanded I them, saying, Hearken to my voice, and I will be your God, and ye shall be my people; and walk in the way which I command you, that it may be well with you. <a href="/jeremiah/7-24.htm">Jeremiah 7:24</a>.

And though thou speakest all these words unto them, yet will they not hearken unto thee; and though thou callest unto them, yet will they not answer thee. <a href="/jeremiah/7-28.htm">Jeremiah 7:28</a>. Thus speak to them: This is the people that hearken not unto the voice of Jahveh its God, and that receive not correction. Perished is faithfulness, cut off from their mouth."<p>The purport of <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-16.htm">Jeremiah 7:16</a>, that God will not suffer Himself to be moved by any entreaties to revoke the doom pronounced on the wicked people, is expressed by way of a command from God to the prophet not to pray for the people. That Jeremiah did sometimes pray thus, however, we see from <a href="/jeremiah/14-19.htm">Jeremiah 14:19</a>. (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/18-20.htm">Jeremiah 18:20</a>), when to his prayer the same answer is given as we have here, and all intercession for the corrupt race is characterized as in vain. The second clause: lift not up for them crying, i.e., supplicatory prayer, expresses the same, only more strongly; while the third clause: urge me not, cuts off all hope of success from even the most importunate intercession. The reason for this command to desist is shown in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-17.htm">Jeremiah 7:17</a>, by a reference to the idolatry which was openly practised throughout the land by young and old, men and women. Each takes part according to strength and capacity: the sons gather wood together, the fathers set the fire in order, etc. The deity so zealously worshipped by the people is called the Queen of heaven, and is mentioned only by Jeremiah. Besides here, there is reference to her in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-17.htm">Jeremiah 44:17</a>, where we see that her worship was very diligently cultivated, and that she was adored as the bestower of earthly possessions. (&#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1514; is stat. constr., either from the Chald. form &#1502;&#1500;&#1498;, or from &#1502;&#1500;&#1497;&#1499;&#1492;, after the analogy of &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1514;, st. constr. of &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1512;&#1492;; but perhaps it has &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1514; in stat. abs.) This worship was combined with that of the stars, the host of heaven, which especially prevailed under Manasseh (<a href="/2_kings/21-5.htm">2 Kings 21:5</a>). Thence it may be presumed that the Queen of heaven was one of the deities who came to Western Asia with the Assyrians, and that she corresponds to the Assyrian-Persian Tanais and Artemis, who in the course of time took the place once occupied by the closely related Phoenician Astarte. She is originally a deification of the moon, the Assyrian Selene and Virgo caelestis, who, as supreme female deity, was companion to Baal-Moloch as sun-god; cf. Movers, Phnizier, i. S. 623ff. With this accords the statement of Steph. Byz., that &#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7; is also &#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b9; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c9; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;. The offerings which, acc. to this verse and <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-19.htm">Jeremiah 44:19</a>, were brought to her, are called &#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, a word which would appear to have come to the Hebrews along with the foreign cultus. By the lxx it was Grecized into &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;, for which we find in glossators and codd. &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; and &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;. They were, acc. to the Etymol. magn. and Suidas, &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#837; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2; or &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1; &#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; (? cooked vegetables); acc. to Jerome, &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;, quas nos placentas interpretati sumus. In any case, they were some kind of sacrificial cakes, which Vitr. put alongside of the &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1; of Aristophanes and Lucian; cf. the various interpretations in Schleussner, Lexic. in lxx s.v. &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bd;. These cakes were kindled on the altar (cf. &#1502;&#1511;&#1496;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="/jeremiah/44-19.htm">Jeremiah 44:19</a>) as a kind of Minchah (meat-offering), and with this Minchah a libation or drink-offering (&#1504;&#1505;&#1499;&#1497;&#1501;) was combined. &#1492;&#1505;&#1468;&#1498; corresponds to &#1500;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1514;, so that &#1500; has to be repeated; cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-19.htm">Jeremiah 44:19</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-25.htm">Jeremiah 44:25</a>, where we find libations poured out to the Queen of heaven. In the 18th verse the expression is generalized into "other gods," with reference to the fact that the service of the Queen of heaven was but one kind of idolatry along with others, since other strange gods were worshipped by sacrifices and libations. To provoke me; cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/31-29.htm">Deuteronomy 31:29</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-16.htm">Deuteronomy 32:16</a>, etc. </body></html>
