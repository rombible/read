Its ritual probably resembled that of the Babylonian Aphrodite, Mylitta, the mother-goddess, in its impurities (Herod. i. 199; Bar 6:43), and thus provoked the burning indignation of the prophet here and in <a href="/jeremiah/44-19.htm" title="And when we burned incense to the queen of heaven, and poured out drink offerings to her, did we make her cakes to worship her, and pour out drink offerings to her, without our men?">Jeremiah 44:19</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/44-25.htm" title="Thus said the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying; You and your wives have both spoken with your mouths, and fulfilled with your hand, saying, We will surely perform our vows that we have vowed, to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings to her: you will surely accomplish your vows, and surely perform your vows.">Jeremiah 44:25</a>. The word rendered “cakes,” and found only in connection with this worship, was clearly a technical term, and probably of foreign origin.

The worship of Ashtoreth (Milton speaks of her as “Astarte, Queen of Heaven, with crescent horn “), though of kindred nature, was not identical with that of the Queen of Heaven, that name signifying a star, and being identified with the planet Venus.

Others read as Margin, "the frame of heaven," that is, the planets generally; so the Septuagint here; but elsewhere the Septuagint translates, "queen of heaven." The Phœnicians called the moon Ashtoreth or Astarte: the wife of Baal or Moloch, the king of heaven. The male and female pair of deities symbolized the generative powers of nature; hence arose the introduction of prostitution in the worship. The Babylonians worshipped Ashtoreth as Mylitta, that is, generative. Our Monday, or Moon-day, indicates the former prevalence of moon worship (see on [901]Isa 65:11).<p>that they may provoke me&#8212;implying design: in worshipping strange gods they seemed as if purposely to provoke Jehovah.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Here God shows how busily they are employed from the youngest to the oldest, and how industrious for their idolatry, <span class="bld"><a href="/context/jeremiah/44-1.htm" title="The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews which dwell in the land of Egypt, which dwell at Migdol, and at Tahpanhes, and at Noph, and in the country of Pathros, saying,...">Jeremiah 44:1-7</a></span>; see <span class="bld"><a href="/matthew/24-38.htm" title="For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark,">Matthew 24:38</a></span>; every one in the family doth somewhat towards it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The children gather wood, </span> or sticks; for the word is plural, and so used <span class="bld"><a href="/numbers/15-32.htm" title="And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man that gathered sticks on the sabbath day.">Numbers 15:32</a>,33</span>; an employment, if we understand small sticks, proper for children; if greater wood, suitable to youth, who excel in strength, and may be understood by children and young ones. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The fathers kindle the fire; </span> they heat the oven, hearth, or stone on which they were baked. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The women knead their dough, </span> to make cakes; prepare all the materials of which to make cakes; probably they were of some particular shape, or had some peculiar impression of some of their gods stamped upon them, like the popish wafers, some say stamped with stars, as being offered up to the host of heaven, or with some peculiar star, <span class="bld"><a href="/amos/5-26.htm" title="But you have borne the tabernacle of your Moloch and Chiun your images, the star of your god, which you made to yourselves.">Amos 5:26</a> <a href="/acts/7-43.htm" title="Yes, you took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, figures which you made to worship them: and I will carry you away beyond Babylon.">Acts 7:43</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">To the queen of heaven; </span> or, frame or workmanship of heaven: this is diversely interpreted; some take it for the sun, which is signified by a word of the feminine gender, <span class="bld"><a href="/isaiah/24-23.htm" title="Then the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed, when the LORD of hosts shall reign in mount Zion, and in Jerusalem, and before his ancients gloriously.">Isaiah 24:23</a></span>, and of a feminine use, <span class="bld"><a href="/nahum/3-17.htm" title="Your crowned are as the locusts, and your captains as the great grasshoppers, which camp in the hedges in the cold day, but when the sun rises they flee away, and their place is not known where they are.">Nahum 3:17</a></span>; some for the moon; as the sun was looked upon as king, so the moon as the queen of heaven, because of the largeness of her body in which she appears, and of the light she gives, but especially by reason of the government she exerciseth over inferior bodies; others, more probably, for the whole host of heaven, <span class="bld"><a href="/jeremiah/8-2.htm" title="And they shall spread them before the sun, and the moon, and all the host of heaven, whom they have loved, and whom they have served, and after whom they have walked, and whom they have sought, and whom they have worshipped: they shall not be gathered, nor be buried; they shall be for dung on the face of the earth.">Jeremiah 8:2</a> 19:13</span>, and so the LXX, according to which probably for their sakes they received divers stamps and impressions: they that would see more may consult the English Annotations and the Synopsis. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">To pour out drink-offerings, </span> viz. wine and other strong drinks, <span class="bld"><a href="/exodus/29-40.htm" title="And with the one lamb a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part of an hin of beaten oil; and the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering.">Exodus 29:40</a>,41 Num 28:7</span>.

The cakes were either shaped, or stamped, to represent the “queen of heaven,” probably to be identified, not with the moon, but with the planet Venus, the Ishtar of Babylonian worship (Co.). The cult was thence derived, and appears to have been introduced in Manasseh’s reign. “The description points to its prevalence among the poorer classes, who have to collect firewood and do all the work themselves.” Pe. The Mass., by a different vocalisation of the word for “queen,” apparently to avoid this sense, gives <span class="ital">work</span> (meaning, however, <span class="ital">host</span>, in accordance with the Rabbinic interpretation of “work” in <a href="/genesis/2-1.htm" title="Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.">Genesis 2:1</a> f.) <span class="ital">of heaven</span>; and so LXX here, whereas in <a href="/jeremiah/44-17.htm" title="But we will certainly do whatever thing goes forth out of our own mouth, to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings to her, as we have done, we, and our fathers, our kings, and our princes, in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem: for then had we plenty of victuals, and were well, and saw no evil.">Jeremiah 44:17</a> etc. they render rightly “queen.”<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The children... the fathers... the women</span>.

The word is peculiar (<span class="accented">kavvanim</span>), and perhaps entered Palestine together with the foreign rite to which the cakes belonged. Various conjectures have been offered as to their nature, but without any demonstrable ground. Sacrificial cakes were not uncommon. Hosea refers to the luscious raisin-cakes used by idolaters (<a href="/hosea/3-1.htm">Hosea 3:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To the queen of heaven.</span> This title of a divinity only occurs in Jeremiah (here and in <a href="/jeremiah/44-17.htm">Jeremiah 44:17-19, 25</a>). It reminds us, first, of titles (such as "queen of the gods") of the Babylonic-Assyrian goddesses, Bilat (Beltis) and Istar, who, though divided in later times, were "originally but two forms of the same goddess" (Sayce, <span class="accented">Transactions of Society of Biblical Archaeology</span>, 3:169). It is, however, perhaps an <span class="accented">objection</span> to the view that Bilat or Istar is intended, that neither here nor in <a href="/jeremiah/44.htm">Jeremiah 44</a>. is there any allusion to that characteristic lascivious custom which was connected in Babylonia with the worship of Istar (Herod., 1:199). The phrase has, however, another association. It reminds us, in the second place, of the Egyptian goddess Neith, "the mother of the gods." The first mention of "the queen of heaven" in Jeremiah occurs in the reign of Jehoiakim, who was placed on the throne by Pharaoh-Necho, one of the Saite dynasty (Says was the seat of the worship of Neith). If the "queen of heaven" were a Babylonic-Assyrian goddess, we should have looked for the introduction of her cultus at an earlier period (e.g. under Ahaz). But it was in accordance with the principles of polytheism (and the mass of the Jews had an irresistible tendency to polytheism), to adopt the patron-deity of the suzerain. Subsequently Judah became the subject of Nebuchadnezzar; thus it was equally natural to give up the worship of an Egyptian deity. Jewish colonists in Migdol would as naturally revert to the cultus of the Egyptian "mother of the gods" (see Gratz, 'Monatsschrift,' Breslau, 1874, pp. 349-351). The form of the word rendered "queen" being very uncommon, another reading, pronounced in the same way, obtained currency. This should be rendered, not "frame," or "workmanship" (as Authorized Version, margin), but "service." The context, however, evidently requires a person. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The temple is to undergo the fate of the former sanctuary at Shiloh. This threat is introduced by a grounding &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, for. This for refers to the central idea of the last verse, that they must not build their expectations on the temple, hold it to be a pledge for their safety. For since the Lord has seen how they have profaned and still profane it, He will destroy it, as the sanctuary at Shiloh was destroyed. The rhetorical mode of utterance, Go to the place, etc., contributes to strengthen the threatening. They were to behold with their own eyes the fate of the sanctuary at Shiloh, that so they might understand that the sacredness of a place does not save it from overthrow, if men have desecrated it by their wickedness. We have no historical notice of the event to which Jeremiah refers. At Shiloh, now Seiln (in ruins) the Mosaic tabernacle was erected after the conquest of Canaan (<a href="/joshua/18-1.htm">Joshua 18:1</a>), and there it was still standing in the time of the high priest Eli, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-1.htm">1 Samuel 1:1-3</a>; but the ark, which had fallen into the hands of the Philistines at the time of their victory (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/4.htm">1 Samuel 4</a>), was not brought back to the tabernacle when it was restored again to the Israelites. In the reign of Saul we find the tabernacle at Nob (<a href="/1_samuel/21-2.htm">1 Samuel 21:2</a>.). The words of <a href="/jeremiah/7-12.htm">Jeremiah 7:12</a> intimate, that at that time "the place of God at Shiloh" was lying in ruins. As Hitz. justly remarks, the destruction of it is not to be understood of its gradual decay after the removal of the ark (<a href="/1_samuel/4-11.htm">1 Samuel 4:11</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/7-1.htm">1 Samuel 7:1</a>.); the words imply a devastation or destruction, not of the place of God at Shiloh only, but of the place Shiloh itself. This is clearly seen from <a href="/jeremiah/7-14.htm">Jeremiah 7:14</a> : I will do unto this house (the temple), and the place which I gave to your fathers, as I have done unto Shiloh. This destruction did not take place when the Assyrians overthrew the kingdom of the ten tribes, but much earlier. It may, indeed, be gathered from <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/18-20.htm">Judges 18:20</a>, <a href="/judges/18-31.htm">Judges 18:31</a> (see the comment. on this passage), that it was as early as the time of Saul, during a Syrian invasion. By the destruction of the place of God at Shiloh, we need not understand that the tabernacle itself, with its altar and other sacred furniture (except the ark), was swept away. Such a view is contradicted by the statement in <a href="/1_chronicles/21-29.htm">1 Chronicles 21:29</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-3.htm">2 Chronicles 1:3</a>, according to which the tabernacle built by Moses in the wilderness was still standing at Gibeon in David's time, and in the beginning of Solomon's reign; cf. with <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-5.htm">2 Chronicles 1:5</a>, when the brazen altar of burnt-offering is expressly mentioned as that which was made by Bezaleel. Hence it is clear that the Mosaic tabernacle, with its altar of burnt-offering, had been preserved, and consequently that it must have been moved first from Shiloh to Nob, and then, when Saul sacked this town (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/22.htm">1 Samuel 22</a>), to Gibeon. The destruction of the place of God in Shiloh must accordingly have consisted in this, that not only was the tabernacle with the altar carried off from thence, but the buildings necessary in connection with the maintenance of the public worship which surrounded it were swept away when the city was plundered, so that of the place of the sanctuary nothing was left remaining. It is clear that about the tabernacle there were various buildings which, along with the tabernacle and its altars, constituted "the house of God at Shiloh;" for in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/3.htm">1 Samuel 3</a> we are told that Samuel slept in the temple of Jahveh (<a href="/1_samuel/3-3.htm">1 Samuel 3:3</a>), and that in the morning he opened the doors of the house of God (<a href="/1_samuel/3-15.htm">1 Samuel 3:15</a>). Hence we may gather, that round about the court of the tabernacle there were buildings erected, which were used partly as a dwelling-place for the officiating priests and Levites, and partly for storing up the heave-offerings, and for preparing the thank-offerings at the sacrificial meals (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-11.htm">1 Samuel 2:11-21</a>). This whole system of buildings surrounding the tabernacle, with its court and altar of burnt-offering, was called the "house of God;" from which name Graf erroneously inferred that there was at Shiloh a temple like the one in Jerusalem. The wickedness of my people, is the Israelites' fall into idolatry in Eli's time, because of which the Lord gave up Israel into the power of the Philistines and other enemies (<a href="/judges/13-1.htm">Judges 13:1</a>; cf. <a href="/1_samuel/7-3.htm">1 Samuel 7:3</a>). "These deeds" (<a href="/jeremiah/7-13.htm">Jeremiah 7:13</a>) are the sins named in <a href="/jeremiah/7-9.htm">Jeremiah 7:9</a>. &#1493;&#1488;&#1491;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; is a continuation of the infinitive sentence, and is still dependent on &#1497;&#1506;&#1503;.
