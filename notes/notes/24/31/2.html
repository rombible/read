Israel of old had “found grace in the wilderness” (comp. <a href="/hosea/11-1.htm" title="When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt.">Hosea 11:1</a>). But as the prophet has in his thoughts a new manifestation of that love, his language is modified accordingly. He thinks of the captives that had escaped, or should hereafter escape, the sword of the Chaldæans (there had been no such deliverance in the case of the Egyptian exodus), and of their finding grace in the wilderness that lies between Palestine and the Euphrates. The verses that follow show, however, that the prophet is thinking also of the more distant exiles, the ten tribes in the cities of the Medes beyond the Tigris (<a href="/2_kings/17-6.htm" title="In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria, and carried Israel away into Assyria, and placed them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.">2Kings 17:6</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Even Israel, when I went to cause him to rest.</span>—The verb that answers to the last five words includes the meaning of “settling” or “establishing,” as well as of giving rest; and the whole clause is better translated <span class= "ital">Let me go, </span>or <span class= "ital">I will go </span>(the verb is in the infinitive with the force of an imperative, but this is its meaning) <span class= "ital">to set him at rest, even Israel.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/31.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/jeremiah/31-2.htm" title="Thus said the LORD, The people which were left of the sword found grace in the wilderness; even Israel, when I went to cause him to rest.">Jeremiah 31:2</a></span>. <span class="ital">The people that were left of the sword </span>— That sword of Pharaoh with which he cut off the male children as soon as they were born, and that sword with which he threatened to cut them off when he pursued them to the Red sea. <span class="ital">Found grace in the wilderness </span>— Though in the wilderness, where they seemed to be lost and forgotten, as these latter Jews and Israelites were now in a strange land, yet they found grace in God’s sight, were owned, and highly honoured by him, and blessed with wonderful instances of his peculiar favour. <span class="ital">And he went to cause them to rest </span>— Went before them in a pillar of cloud, to mark out the places for them where they should pitch their tents, and conducted them to the land that he had provided for them.

When brought very low, and difficulties appear, it is good to remember that it has been so with the church formerly. But it is hard under present frowns to take comfort from former smiles; yet it is the happiness of those who, through grace, are interested in the love of God, that it is an everlasting love, from everlasting in the counsels, to everlasting in the continuance. Those whom God loves with this love, he will draw to himself, by the influences of his Spirit upon their souls. When praising God for what he has done, we must call upon him for the favours his church needs and expects. When the Lord calls, we must not plead that we cannot come; for he that calls us, will help us, will strengthen us. The goodness of God shall lead them to repentance. And they shall weep for sin with more bitterness, and more tenderness, when delivered out of their captivity, than when groaning under it. If we take God for our Father, and join the church of the first-born, we shall want nothing that is good for us. These predictions doubtless refer also to a future gathering of the Israelites from all quarters of the globe. And they figuratively describe the conversion of sinners to Christ, and the plain and safe way in which they are led.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/31.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The people which were left of the sword - A promise of the restoration of the ten tribes to their land.<p>The wilderness - Either the desert which lay between Assyria and Palestine; or more probably an allusion to the wilderness of Mount Sinai.<p>Found grace ... rest - Rather, "shall certainly find grace; I will go to give Israel rest. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/31.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. Upon the grace manifested to Israel "in the wilderness" God grounds His argument for renewing His favors to them now in their exile; because His covenant is "everlasting" (Jer 31:3), and changes not. The same argument occurs in Ho 13:5, 9, 10; 14:4, 5, 8. Babylon is fitly compared to the "wilderness," as in both alike Israel was as a stranger far from his appointed "rest" or home, and Babylon is in Isa 40:3 called a "desert" (compare Jer 50:12).<p>I went to cause him to rest&#8212;namely, in the pillar of cloud and fire, the symbol of God's presence, which went before Israel to search a resting-place (Nu 10:33; Isa 63:14) for the people, both a temporary one at each halt in the wilderness, and a permanent one in Canaan (Ex 33:14; De 3:20; Jos 21:44; Ps 95:11; Heb 3:11).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/31.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> God confirmeth the aforementioned promises, and his people’s hope and faith in them, by minding them of what he had anciently done for this very people. Though God did, in the journey which the Israelites had from Egypt to Canaan, cut off many of them by the sword for their iniquities, some by the Amalekites, <span class="bld"><a href="/exodus/17-8.htm" title="Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim.">Exodus 17:8</a></span>, some by the swords of their brethren for the idolatry they committed about the golden calf, <span class="bld"><a href="/exodus/32-28.htm" title="And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men.">Exodus 32:28</a></span>; yet those that survived that and other judgments found favour in God’s eyes while they were going to Canaan the land of rest, or while God, going before them, brought them into Canaan. God paralleleth his future providences and gracious purposes with his past gracious providences. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/31.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Thus saith the Lord, the people which were left of the sword,.... Which were not consumed by the sword of Pharaoh, who perished not through his cruel edicts, and by his sword, when drawn at the Red sea; nor by the sword of the Amalekites and Amorites; or of their own brethren, who sometimes, for their sins, were ordered to slay many, as on account of the molten calf, and joining to Baalpeor: but there was a remnant that escaped, who <p>found grace in the wilderness; in the sight of God, who went before them, protected and defended them from their enemies; gave them his holy law, his statutes, and his judgments; fed them with manna and quails; clave the rocks, and gave them water to drink; and supplied them with everything necessary for them, <a href="/psalms/78-5.htm">Psalm 78:5</a>; <p>even Israel, when I went to cause him to rest; went before him in a pillar of cloud by day, and in a pillar of fire by night; and in the ark, the symbol of his presence; and not only to search out a resting place for them for a few days, but to bring them to Canaan, the land of rest, which he had promised them, <a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21</a>; now this past instance of divine goodness is mentioned, to encourage faith in the fulfilment of the above promise. The whole is paraphrased by the Targum thus, <p>"these things saith the Lord, who gave mercies to the people that came out of Egypt; he supplied their necessities in the wilderness, when they fled from before those who slay with the sword; he led them by his word, to cause Israel to dwell in a place of rest.'' <p>Some render the words in the future, "shall find grace", &amp;c. "shall go to his rest", &amp;c. and so apply it to the Jews that escaped the sword of the Chaldeans, and found favour in the wilderness of the people into which they were brought, and as they returned into their own land from the captivity. And it, nay be also applied to the Jews that were left of the sword of the Romans in their last destruction, who have found much favour among the nations; as they do in ours, and others, now; and who in time will return to their own land, and be in rest, <a href="/jeremiah/30-10.htm">Jeremiah 30:10</a>. Yea, it is applicable enough to the church and people of God in their present state; who are left of the sword of the Papists, and are now in the wilderness, where they are nourished for a time, and times, and half a time; and before long will be brought into a state of settled rest and tranquillity. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/31.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Thus saith the LORD, The people <i>who were</i> <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> left by the sword found grace in the wilderness; <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> <i>even</i> Israel, when I went to cause him to rest.</span><p>(b) Who were delivered from the cruelty of Pharaoh.<p>(c) That is, God.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/31.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2</span>.

The language suggests a date approximately that of ch. 3. Those of the Northern tribes who have survived the slaughter attendant upon their overthrow, and are in the “wilderness” of exile, shall see the Lord, and find favour in His eyes. Their hitherto restless wanderings shall have an end. They shall return to their old home. The verbs are in the “prophetic past.” The prophet describes the reconciliation with Jehovah as already accomplished.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">when I went to cause him to rest</span>] or, mg. <span class="ital">when he went to find him rest</span>; but better than either (as Jehovah appears still to be the speaker), <span class="bld">I will go, that I may cause Israel to rest</span> (so Dr.).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The people</span> which were <span class="cmt_word">left of the sword,</span> etc.; literally, <span class="accented">the people of those left of the sword.</span> The expression clearly implies that the Jews at the time spoken of had escaped, or were about to escape, in some great battle or some other kind of slaughter. Hence the finding grace in the wilderness cannot refer to the sequel of the passage through the Red Sea, and we must perforce explain it of the second great deliverance, viz. from the Babylonian exile. This view is strongly confirmed by <a href="/jeremiah/51-50.htm">Jeremiah 51:50</a>, where the Israelites who escape the predicted slaughter at Babylon are called "escaped ones from the sword," and exhorted to remember Jehovah and Jerusalem "afar off." The "wilderness" of the present passage, like the "afar off" of ch. 51. (and of the next verse) seems to mean Babylon, which was, by comparison with the highly favoured Judah, a "barren and dry land" (comp. <a href="/psalms/63-1.htm">Psalm 63:1</a>), a spiritual Arabia. It may be objected that the tense here is the perfect; but there is abundance of analogy for explaining it as the prophetic perfect. The restoration of the chosen people to favour is as certain in the Divine counsels as if it were already an event past. (It seems less appropriate to understand "the wilderness" of the country which separated Assyria from Palestine. It was in Babylon that the covenant of Sinai was renewed to God's repentant people.) <span class="cmt_word">Even Israel, when I went to cause him to rest;</span> rather, <span class="accented">when I went to cause Israel to rest</span> (literally, <span class="accented">to cause him</span> - <span class="accented">Israel</span> - <span class="accented">to rest</span>; but the pleonastic pronoun need not be represented in the English). Another possible and perhaps preferable rendering is, <span class="accented">I will go to cause</span>, etc. "Rest" could only be had in the consciousness of God's favor. With all the outward property of many of the Jews in Babylon, there was no true "rest." Comp. chap. 16, "Ask for the old paths.., and walk therein, and ye shall find rest for your souls" (the same verbal root in the Hebrew for "rest" in both passages). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/30.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Further explanation of the deliverance promised to Zion. - <a href="/jeremiah/30-18.htm">Jeremiah 30:18</a>. "Thus saith Jahveh: Behold, I will turn the captivity of the tents of Jacob, and will take pity on his dwellings; and the city shall be built again upon its own hill, and the palace shall be inhabited after its own fashion. <a href="/jeremiah/30-19.htm">Jeremiah 30:19</a>. And there shall come forth from them praise and the voice of those who laugh; and I will multiply them, so that they shall not be few, and I will honour them, so that they shall not be mean. <a href="/jeremiah/30-20.htm">Jeremiah 30:20</a>. And his sons shall be as in former times, and his congregation shall be established before me, and I will punish all that oppress him. <a href="/jeremiah/30-21.htm">Jeremiah 30:21</a>. And his leader shall spring from himself, and his ruler shall proceed from his midst; and I will bring him near, so that he shall approach to me; for who is he that became surety for his life in drawing near to me? saith Jahveh. <a href="/jeremiah/30-22.htm">Jeremiah 30:22</a>. And ye shall become my people, and I will be your God."<p>The dwellings of Israel that have been laid waste, and the cities that have been destroyed, shall be restored and inhabited as formerly, so that songs of praise and tones of joy shall resound from them (<a href="/jeremiah/30-18.htm">Jeremiah 30:18</a>.). "The captivity of the tents of Jacob" means the miserable condition of the dwellings of Jacob, i.e., of all Israel; for "to turn the captivity" has everywhere a figurative sense, and signifies the turning of adversity and misery into prosperity and comfort; see on <a href="/jeremiah/29-14.htm">Jeremiah 29:14</a>. Hitzig is quite wrong in his rendering: "I bring back the captives of the tents of Jacob, i.e., those who have been carried away out of the tents." That "tents" does not stand for those who dwell in tents, but is a poetic expression for "habitations," is perfectly clear from the parallel "his dwellings." To "take pity on the dwellings" means to "restore the dwellings that have been destroyed" (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/9-18.htm">Jeremiah 9:18</a>). The anarthrous &#1506;&#1497;&#1512; must not be restricted to the capital, but means every city that has been destroyed; here, the capital naturally claims the first consideration. "Upon its hills" is equivalent to saying on its former site, cf. <a href="/joshua/11-13.htm">Joshua 11:13</a>; it does not mean "on the mound made by its ruins," in support of which Ngelsbach erroneously adduces <a href="/deuteronomy/13-17.htm">Deuteronomy 13:17</a>. &#1488;&#1512;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503; in like manner stands, in the most general way, for every palace. &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;&#1493; does not mean "on the proper place," i.e., on an open, elevated spot on the hill (Hitzig), neither does it mean "on its right position" (Ewald); both of these renderings are against the usage of the words: but it signifies "according to its right" (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/17-11.htm">Deuteronomy 17:11</a>), i.e., in accordance with what a palace requires, after its own fashion. &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;, to be inhabited, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-6.htm">Jeremiah 17:6</a>, etc. "Out of them" refers to the cities and palaces. Thence proceeds, resounds praise or thanksgiving for the divine grace shown them (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/33-11.htm">Jeremiah 33:11</a>), and the voice, i.e., the tones or sounds, of those who laugh (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/15-17.htm">Jeremiah 15:17</a>), i.e., of the people living in the cities and palaces, rejoicing over their good fortune. "I will increase them, so that they shall not become fewer," cf. <a href="/jeremiah/29-6.htm">Jeremiah 29:6</a>; "I will bring them to honour (cf. <a href="/isaiah/8-22.htm">Isaiah 8:22</a>), so that they shall not be lightly esteemed." - In <a href="/jeremiah/30-20.htm">Jeremiah 30:20</a>. the singular suffixes refer to Jacob as a nation (<a href="/jeremiah/30-18.htm">Jeremiah 30:18</a>). "His sons" are the members of the nation; they become as they were previously, in former times - sicut olim sub Davide et Salmonoe, florentissimo rerum statu. "The congregation will be established before me," i.e., under my survey (&#1514;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1503; as in <a href="/psalms/102-29.htm">Psalm 102:29</a>), i.e., they shall no more be shaken or moved from their position.</body></html>
