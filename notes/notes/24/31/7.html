When brought very low, and difficulties appear, it is good to remember that it has been so with the church formerly. But it is hard under present frowns to take comfort from former smiles; yet it is the happiness of those who, through grace, are interested in the love of God, that it is an everlasting love, from everlasting in the counsels, to everlasting in the continuance. Those whom God loves with this love, he will draw to himself, by the influences of his Spirit upon their souls. When praising God for what he has done, we must call upon him for the favours his church needs and expects. When the Lord calls, we must not plead that we cannot come; for he that calls us, will help us, will strengthen us. The goodness of God shall lead them to repentance. And they shall weep for sin with more bitterness, and more tenderness, when delivered out of their captivity, than when groaning under it. If we take God for our Father, and join the church of the first-born, we shall want nothing that is good for us. These predictions doubtless refer also to a future gathering of the Israelites from all quarters of the globe. And they figuratively describe the conversion of sinners to Christ, and the plain and safe way in which they are led.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/31.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Among - Or, because of.

The people are urged with praises and prayers to supplicate for their universal restoration. Jehovah is represented in the context (Jer 31:1, 8), as promising immediately to restore Israel. They therefore praise God for the restoration, being as certain of it as if it were actually accomplished; and at the same time pray for it, as prayer was a means to the desired end. Prayer does not move God to grant our wishes, but when God has determined to grant our wishes, He puts it into our hearts to pray for the thing desired. Compare Ps 102:13-17, as to the connection of Israel's restoration with the prayers of His people (Isa 62:1-6).<p>for Jacob&#8212;on account of Jacob; on account of his approaching deliverance by Jehovah.<p>among&#8212;"for," that is, on account of, would more exactly suit the parallelism to "for Jacob."<p>chief of the nations&#8212;Israel: as the parallelism to "Jacob" proves (compare Ex 19:5; Ps 135:4; Am 6:1). God estimates the greatness of nations not by man's standard of material resources, but by His electing favor.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/31.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This grave, authoritative preface, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Thus saith the Lord, </span> seemeth to be prefixed to put the people of God out of fear of the accomplishment of the good things he had before promised and prophesied of. The verse in itself is either an exhortation to those amongst the Jews who feared God, or to the heathen, to sing and rejoice on the behalf of the Jews, to whom God would certainly show such mercy as they might <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">sing</span> for; before they had it in their hands, they might both publish the thing that it should certainly be, and also bless God for it. But withal he minds them that there would be occasion for prayer as well as praise, there would be a <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">remnant of Israel</span> that would have at least no present share in these mercies, through their impenitency, unbelief, and hardness of heart. Hereby minding us that we ought not so to rejoice in our good things, as to forget those who are no sharers with us. The best of God’s people’s lot, while they are in this life, is such as will show them a need of prayer as well as praise. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/31.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For thus saith the Lord, sing with gladness for Jacob,.... For the restoration of Jacob, or the conversion of the Jews; which will be matter of joy to the Christians among the Gentiles; who seem to be here called upon to express their joy on that occasion, as they will; for it will be to them as life from the dead, <a href="/romans/11-15.htm">Romans 11:15</a>. Kimchi thinks there is a trajection in the words; and that they may be rendered, "thus saith the Lord to Jacob, sing with gladness"; as if the exhortation was to him to rejoice, and not to others on his account; and so the Septuagint and Arabic versions render it; and to the same sense the Syriac version, "thus saith the Lord, sing, O ye of the house of Jacob, with gladness"; and so the Targum; it will no doubt be a joyful time with them: <p>and shout among the chief of the nations; where they shall be when converted, as in Great Britain, and other places: or, "on the top of the nations" (l); on some high place among them. It seems to denote the publicness of the shout; it will be open and manifest to all; so the Targum, <p>"and exult with head uncovered, in the sight of all people;'' <p>Turks, Papists, and Pagans: <p>publish ye; or "cause to hear", or "to be heard" (m); cause their voice to be heard, both in prayer and praise to God; or cause men to hear their faith in Christ, and profession of it; and publish that Gospel, and spread it among others, which before they rejected and despised: <p>praise ye; the Lord for his wonderful grace in the conversion of them: <p>and say, O Lord, save thy people, the remnant of Israel; his covenant people; the remnant according to the election of grace. This is a direction to the Jews that are converted, to pray for the rest that are not; or to the Gentiles to pray for them; who are before called upon to rejoice at the first appearance of this wonderful work, and to spread it abroad, and to go on publishing the Gospel for the more forwarding of it; and to praise the Lord for what he had done; and to pray unto him to go on with the work of saving his people, the residue of them. <p>(l)  "in cacumine gentium", Castalio; "in capite gentium", Pagninus, Montanus.

"At that time, saith Jahveh, will I be a God to all the families of Israel, and they shall be my people. <a href="/jeremiah/31-2.htm">Jeremiah 31:2</a>. Thus saith Jahveh: A people escaped from the sword found grace in the wilderness. Let me go to give him rest, even Israel. <a href="/jeremiah/31-3.htm">Jeremiah 31:3</a>. From afar hath Jahve appeared unto me, and with everlasting love have I loved thee; therefore have I continued my favour towards thee. <a href="/jeremiah/31-4.htm">Jeremiah 31:4</a>. Once more will I build thee up, and thou shalt be built, O virgin of Israel; once more shalt thou adorn [thyself] with thy tabrets, and go forth in the dance of those that make merry. <a href="/jeremiah/31-5.htm">Jeremiah 31:5</a>. Once more shalt thou plant vineyards on the ills of Samaria; planters will plant them, and apply them to common use. <a href="/jeremiah/31-6.htm">Jeremiah 31:6</a>. For there is a day [when] watchmen will cry on Mount Ephraim: Arise ye, and let us go up to Zion, to Jahveh our God!"<p>The expression "At that time" refers to <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-24.htm">Jeremiah 30:24</a>, "in the end of the days," which means the Messianic future. The announcement of deliverance itself is continued by resumption of the promise made in <a href="/jeremiah/30-22.htm">Jeremiah 30:22</a>; the transposition of the two portions of the promise is to be remarked. Here, "I will be a God to them" stands first, because the restoration and perfection of Israel have their only foundation in the love of God and in the faithfulness with which He keeps His covenant, and it is only through this gracious act that Israel again becomes the people of God. "All the families of Israel" are the families of the whole twelve tribes - of the two kingdoms of Israel and Judah, separated since the death of Solomon. After this announcement of deliverance for the whole of Israel, the address turns first to Israel of the ten tribes, and continues to treat longest of them, "because, judging from appearances, they seem irrecoverably lost - for ever rejected by the Lord" (Hengstenberg). <a href="/jeremiah/31-2.htm">Jeremiah 31:2</a> is variously explained. Ewald, following Raschi and others, refers the words '&#1502;&#1510;&#1488; &#1495;&#1503; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; to the leading of Israel out of Egypt: once on a time, in the Arabian desert, the people that had just barely escaped the sword of the Egyptians nevertheless found grace, when Jahveh, as it were, went to make a quiet dwelling-place for them. The love which He displayed towards them at that time He has since continued, and thus He will now once more bring back His people out of the midst of strangers. This view of the passage is supported by the use of the perfects in <a href="/jeremiah/31-2.htm">Jeremiah 31:2</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-3.htm">Jeremiah 31:3</a>, in contrast with the imperfect, "again will I build thee," <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-4.htm">Jeremiah 31:4</a>, and the employment of the expression "in the desert;" cf. <a href="/jeremiah/2-2.htm">Jeremiah 2:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/13-4.htm">Hosea 13:4-5</a>. But "the people of those who have escaped the sword" is an expression that cannot be reconciled with it. Rashi, indeed, understands this as referring to the sword of the Egyptians and Amalekites; but the thought that Israel, led out of Egypt through the Arabian desert, was a people that had survived or escaped the sword, is one met with nowhere else in the Old Testament, and is quite inapplicable to the condition of the people of Israel when they were led out of Egypt. Although Pharaoh wished to exterminate the people of Israel through hard servile labour, and through such measures as the order to kill all male children when they were born, yet he did not make an exhibition of his wrath against Israel by the sword, neither did he show his anger thus at the Red Sea, where he sought to bring Israel back to Egypt by force. There God shielded His people from the attack of Pharaoh, as He did in the battle against the Amalekites, so that Israel was led through the desert as a whole people, not as a remnant. The designation, "a people escaped from the sword," unconditionally requires us to refer the words to the deliverance of the Israelites from exile; these were only a remnant of what they had formerly been, since the greater portion of them perished, partly at the downfall of the kingdom, and partly in exile, by the sword of the enemy. Hence the perfects in <a href="/jeremiah/31-2.htm">Jeremiah 31:2</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/31-3.htm">Jeremiah 31:3</a> are prophetic, and used of the divine counsel, which precedes its execution in time. By using the expression "in the desert," Jeremiah makes an allusion to Israel's being led through the Arabian desert. The restoration of Israel to Canaan, from their exile among the nations, is viewed under the figure of their exodus from Egypt into the land promised to their fathers, as in <a href="/hosea/2-16.htm">Hosea 2:16</a>.; and the exodus from the place of banishment is, at the same time, represented as having already occurred, so that Israel is again on the march to his native land, and is being safely conducted through the desert by his God. There is as little ground for thinking that there is reference here made to the desert lying between Assyria or Babylon and Palestine, as there is for Hitzig's referring &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;&#1491;&#1497; &#1495;&#1512;&#1489; to the sword of the Medes and Persians. - The inf. abs. &#1492;&#1500;&#1493;&#1498; is used instead of the first person of the imperative (cf. <a href="/1_kings/22-30.htm">1 Kings 22:30</a>), to express a summons addressed by God to Himself: "I will go." See Gesenius, 131, 4, b,  &#x3b3;. ] The suffix in &#1492;&#1512;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1506;&#1493; points out the object (Israel) by anticipation: "to bring him to rest." &#1512;&#1490;&#1506; in the Hiphil usually means to be at rest, to rest (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-65.htm">Deuteronomy 28:65</a>); here, to give rest, bring to rest.</body></html>
