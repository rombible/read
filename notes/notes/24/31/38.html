With Jeremiah, however, as before with Isaiah (<a href="/context/isaiah/65-17.htm" title="For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.">Isaiah 65:17-25</a>), and on a much larger scale with Ezekiel (Ezekiel 40-48), this was the natural outgrowth of the vividness with which the restored city came before his mental vision. He saw a goodly city rise as from the ruins of the old, truly and not in name only consecrated to Jehovah, and describes, as best he can, how it differed from them. The tower of Hananeel appears from <a href="/nehemiah/3-1.htm" title="Then Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brothers the priests, and they built the sheep gate; they sanctified it, and set up the doors of it; even to the tower of Meah they sanctified it, to the tower of Hananeel.">Nehemiah 3:1</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/12-39.htm" title="And from above the gate of Ephraim, and above the old gate, and above the fish gate, and the tower of Hananeel, and the tower of Meah, even to the sheep gate: and they stood still in the prison gate.">Nehemiah 12:39</a>, to have been identical, or connected, with the tower of Meah, and to have been between the fish-gate and the sheep-gate, at the north-east corner of the city walls. It is named again, as one of the conspicuous landmarks of the city, in <a href="/zechariah/14-10.htm" title="All the land shall be turned as a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem: and it shall be lifted up, and inhabited in her place, from Benjamin's gate to the place of the first gate, to the corner gate, and from the tower of Hananeel to the king's winepresses.">Zechariah 14:10</a>. The “corner-gate” at the north-west corner, and near the present Jaffa-gate, appears in <a href="/2_kings/14-13.htm" title="And Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah, at Bethshemesh, and came to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits.">2Kings 14:13</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/26-9.htm" title="Moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate, and at the valley gate, and at the turning of the wall, and fortified them.">2Chronicles 26:9</a>; <a href="/zechariah/14-10.htm" title="All the land shall be turned as a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem: and it shall be lifted up, and inhabited in her place, from Benjamin's gate to the place of the first gate, to the corner gate, and from the tower of Hananeel to the king's winepresses.">Zechariah 14:10</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/3-24.htm" title="After him repaired Binnui the son of Henadad another piece, from the house of Azariah to the turning of the wall, even to the corner.">Nehemiah 3:24</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/3-32.htm" title="And between the going up of the corner to the sheep gate repaired the goldsmiths and the merchants.">Nehemiah 3:32</a>. The wall in this quarter had apparently been battered during the siege of Jerusalem, and the prophet naturally sees the rebuilding of the wall as among the first-fruits of the restoration.<span class= "bld"><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/31.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/jeremiah/31-38.htm" title="Behold, the days come, said the LORD, that the city shall be built to the LORD from the tower of Hananeel to the gate of the corner....">Jeremiah 31:38-40</a></span>. <span class="ital">Behold, the days come, that the city shall be built to the Lord </span>— Or, <span class="ital">for the Lord, </span>namely, for his use and service. Blaney renders it, <span class="ital">Under the direction </span>of the Lord, <span class="ital">from the tower of Hananeel, </span>&c. — “Here follows a description of the circumference of a new city to be built on the site of Jerusalem; but that it does not mean the city which was rebuilt after the return of the Jews from the Babylonish captivity is evident from two principal circumstances; first, because the limits are here extended farther, so as to include a greater space than was contained within the walls at that time; and secondly, it is here said, that it should never be razed or destroyed any more. This new city, therefore, must be referred to those after-times when the general restoration of Israel is appointed to take place.” Thus Blaney, with whom many other commentators agree. That this prophecy “was not fulfilled,” says Dr. Dodd, “from the return out of Babylon to the days of Christ, we are assured from sacred history; where we read that mount <span class="ital">Goath, </span>or <span class="ital">Golgotha, </span>(which word in Hebrew signifies <span class="ital">the heap of Gotha,</span>) was situated without Jerusalem. The same may be said of <span class="ital">the valley of dead bodies and of the ashes,” </span>namely, the valley of Hinnom, so described, from its having been made a common burying place, and a receptacle for the rubbish and filth of the city. “As to Gareb we know nothing certain. We may also add, that the last clause of this chapter, <span class="ital">it shall not be plucked up,</span> &c<span class="ital">., any more for ever, </span>cannot refer to the Jerusalem which was rebuilt after the captivity, and which was plucked up and thrown down by the Romans. We must necessarily recur, therefore, either to some future building of that city, or to the church of Christ, against which we are assured <span class="ital">the gates of hell shall never prevail,” </span>and which is elsewhere called the city of God, and the new Jerusalem. Taking the passage in this mystical sense, as a description of the church, in its most enlarged and perfect state, in the latter days: we can be at no loss to explain the clause in the last verse which expresses that all parts of the city, even the valley of Hinnom, and <span class="ital">all the fields, unto the brook Kidron, &c., shall be holy unto the Lord. </span>For, undoubtedly, at this time the church shall be thoroughly purged from all corruption, both with regard to the doctrine taught in it, and the principles and practices of its members, who shall all be both well instructed in divine things, and truly holy in their hearts and lives. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/31.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>31:35-40 As surely as the heavenly bodies will continue their settled course, according to the will of their Creator, to the end of time, and as the raging sea obeys him, so surely will the Jews be continued a separate people.

The word come is not in the text; it is read, but not written. The vowel points are in the text, but not the letters; which those, who are against the antiquity of the points, would do well to consider; since the Jews never suffered any additions to the Bible. Jarchi says this prophecy refers to future times in the latter redemption, and never was fulfilled in the second temple; and indeed, under the figure of rebuilding Jerusalem, seems to be intended the building of the Gospel church, which was to continue to the end of time; for both holiness and perpetuity are ascribed to it: <p>that the city shall be built to the Lord; the city of Jerusalem; which was to be rebuilt upon the return of the Jews from the Babylonish captivity, as by the order, and under the direction and protection of the Lord, so for his service and worship; the temple in it should be built up again, and divine worship restored; and both that and the city, with the inhabitants of it, be devoted to his service; a type of the Gospel church, built up an habitation for God, where he is worshipped, feared, and glorified: <p>from the tower of Hananeel unto the gate of the corner; of the tower of Hananeel mention is made in <a href="/nehemiah/3-1.htm">Nehemiah 3:1</a>. The Targum calls it the tower of Pikkus. Lightfoot places it on the south side of the city, bending to the east; but most place it on the east side of it: here probably the building of the city began in Nehemiah's time, and proceeded to the gate of the corner, which lay northeast; of which see <a href="/2_kings/14-13.htm">2 Kings 14:13</a>; Jerom interprets the tower of Hananeel the tower of obedience, or of the grace and gifts of God, which latter is not much amiss; since the word "Hansheel" may be interpreted "God gives grace"; and the spiritual building of the church proceeds from the grace of God, upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ being the chief corner stone, <a href="/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/31.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that the <span class="cverse3">{o}</span> city shall be built to the LORD from the tower of Hananeel to the gate of the corner.</span><p>(o) As it was performed, Neh 3:1.

Not like the covenant that I made with their fathers on the day when I laid hold of their hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt, which covenant of mine they broke, though I had married them to myself, saith Jahveh; <a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>. But this is the covenant which I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith Jahveh: I will put my law within them, and on their heart will I write it; and I will become to them a God, and they shall be to me a people. <a href="/jeremiah/31-34.htm">Jeremiah 31:34</a>. And they shall no more teach every man his neighbour and every man his brother, saying, Know ye Jahveh, for all of them shall know me, from the least of them to the greatest of them, saith Jahveh; for I will pardon their iniquity, and their sins will I remember no more. <a href="/jeremiah/31-35.htm">Jeremiah 31:35</a>. Thus saith Jahveh, [who] gives the sun for light by day, and the ordinances of the moon and stars for light by night, who rouses the sea so that its waves roar, Jahveh of hosts is His name: <a href="/jeremiah/31-36.htm">Jeremiah 31:36</a>. If these ordinances move away from before me, saith Jahveh, then also will the seed of Israel cease to be a people before me for ever. <a href="/jeremiah/31-37.htm">Jeremiah 31:37</a>. Thus saith Jahveh: If the heavens above can be measured, and the foundations of the earth below can be searched out, then will I also reject all the seed of Israel because of all that they have done, saith Jahveh. <a href="/jeremiah/31-38.htm">Jeremiah 31:38</a>. Behold, days come, saith Jahveh, when the city shall be built for Jahveh, from the tower of Hananeel unto the gate of the corner, <a href="/jeremiah/31-39.htm">Jeremiah 31:39</a>. And the measuring-line shall once more go out straight over the hill of Gareb, and turn round towards Goah. <a href="/jeremiah/31-40.htm">Jeremiah 31:40</a>.

This covenant is to endure for ever, like the unchangeable ordinances of nature (<a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-35.htm">Jeremiah 31:35-37</a>); and in consequence of this, Jerusalem shall be guilt as the holy city of God, which shall never be destroyed again (<a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-38.htm">Jeremiah 31:38-40</a>).<p><a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-32</a><p>&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514; &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; does not mean "to make an appointment," but "to conclude a covenant," to establish a relation of mutual duties and obligations. Every covenant which God concludes with men consists, on the side of God, in assurance of His favours and actual bestowal of them; these bind men to the keeping of the commands laid on them. The covenant which the Lord will make with all Israel in the future is called "a new covenant," as compared with that made with the fathers at Sinai, when the people were led out of Egypt; this latter is thus implicitly called the "old covenant." The words, "on the day when I took them by the hand," etc., must not be restricted, on the one side, to the day of the exodus from Egypt, nor, on the other, to the day when the covenant was solemnly made at Sinai; they rather refer to the whole time of the exodus, which did not reach its termination till the entrance into Canaan, though it culminated in the solemn admission of Israel, at Sinai, as the people of Jahveh; see on <a href="/jeremiah/7-22.htm">Jeremiah 7:22</a>. (On the punctuation of &#1492;&#1495;&#1494;&#1497;&#1511;&#1497;, cf. Ewald, 238, d, Olshaus. Gramm. 191,f.) &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; is not a conjunction, "quod, because," but a relative pronoun, and must be combined with &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497;, "which my covenant," i.e., which covenant of mine. "They" stands emphatically in contrast with "though I" in the following circumstantial clause, which literally means, "but I have married them to myself," or, "I was their husband." As to &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, see on <a href="/jeremiah/3-14.htm">Jeremiah 3:14</a>. Hengstenberg wrongly takes the words as a promise, "but I will marry them to myself;" this view, however, is incompatible with the perfect, and the position of the words as a contrast with "they broke."<p>(Note: In the citation of this passage in <a href="/hebrews/8-8.htm">Hebrews 8:8</a>., the words are quoted according to the lxx version, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#787;&#837;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#768; &#x3b7;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;, although this translation is incorrect, because the apostle does not use these words in proving any point. These same words, moreover, have been rendered by the lxx, in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-14.htm">Jeremiah 3:14</a>, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c9; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;.)<p>The two closely connected expressions indicate why a new covenant was necessary; there is no formal statement, however, of the reason, which is merely given in a subordinate and appended clause. For the proper reason why a new covenant is made is not that the people have broken the old one, but that, though Jahveh had united Israel to Himself, they have broken the covenant and thereby rendered it necessary to make a new one. God the Lord, in virtue of His unchangeable faithfulness, would not alter the relation He had Himself established in His love, but simply found it anew in a way which obviated the breaking of the covenant by Israel. For it was a defect connected with the covenant made with Israel at Sinai, that it could be broken on their part. This defect is not to exist in the new covenant which God will make in after times. The expression "after those (not these) days" is remarkable; &#1492;&#1492;&#1501; is not the same as &#1492;&#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;, and yet the days meant can only be the "coming days;" accordingly, it is "those days" (as in <a href="/jeremiah/31-29.htm">Jeremiah 31:29</a>) that are to be expected. The expression "after these days" is inexact, and probably owes its origin to the idea contained in the phrase "in the end of the days" (&#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514;, cf. <a href="/jeremiah/23-20.htm">Jeremiah 23:20</a>).</body></html>
