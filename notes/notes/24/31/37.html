Over and above the idea, as stated above, that the stability of nature is a parable of the steadfastness of God’s laws and purposes in the spiritual world, there is implied a feeling, like that of <a href="/romans/11-33.htm" title="O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!">Romans 11:33</a>, that man’s finite intellect cannot fathom His modes of working out that purpose any more than it can measure what to the prophet’s mind were the illimitable heaven and the unfathomable earth.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/maclaren/jeremiah/31.htm">MacLaren's Expositions</a></div>Jeremiah<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">WHAT THE IMMENSE CREATION TEACHES<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/jeremiah/31-37.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; If heaven above can be measured, and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath, I will also cast off all the seed of Israel for all that they have done, said the LORD.">Jeremiah 31:37</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> In the former sermon we considered the previous verse as presenting the stability of creation as a guarantee of the firmness of God’s gracious covenant. Now we have to consider these grand closing words which bring before us another aspect of the universe as a guarantee for another side of God’s gracious character. The immensity of creation is a symbol of the inexhaustibleness of the forgiving love of God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. A word or two as to the fact here used as a symbol of the divine long-suffering.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>The prophet had very likely no idea at all beyond the ordinary one that presents itself to the senses-a boundless vault above an endless plain on which we stand, deep, sunless foundations, the Titanic substructions on which all rests, going down who knows where, resting on who knows what. We may smile at the rude conception, but it will be well for us if we can get as vivid an impression of the fact as He had.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> We thankfully avail ourselves of modern science to tell us something about the dimensions of this awful universe of ours. We learn to know that there are millions of miles between these neighbour orbs, that light which has been travelling for thousands of years may not yet have fallen on some portion of the mighty whole, that the planetary masses of our system are but tiny specks in the whole, that every fresh stride which astronomical observation takes but opens up new nebulae to be resolved, where suns and constellations and systems are dwarfed by distance into hazy brightness which hardly deserves the name of light. We know all this, and can find all about the distances in any book. So much for space. Then the geologist comes to bewilder us still more, with extension in time.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> But while all this may serve to give definiteness to the impression, after all, perhaps, it is the eye alone, as it gazes, that really feels the impression. Astronomy is really a very prosaic science.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. The effects which this immensity often produces on men.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>Very commonly in old days it led to actual idolatry, bowing down before these calm, unreachable brightnesses. In our days it too often leads to forgetting God altogether, and not seldom to disbelief that man can be of any account in such a universe. We are told that the notions of a covenant, a redemption, or that God cares about us are presumptuous. We all know the talk of men who are so modestly conscious of their own insignificance that they rebuke God for saying that He loves us, and Christians for believing Him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">III. The true lesson.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>The immensity of the material universe is for us a symbol of the infinity of God’s long-suffering love.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The creation proceeds from a greater Creator. That gigantic and overwhelming magnitude, that hoary and immemorial age, that complicated and innumerable multitude of details, what less can they show than ONE Eternal and Infinite?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The immense suggests the infinite.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Granted that you cannot from the immense creation rise logically to the Infinite Creator, still the facts that the soul conceives that there is an infinite God, and is conscious of the spontaneous evoking of that thought by the contemplation of the immeasurable, are strong reasons for believing that it is a legitimate process of thought which hears the name of God thundered from the far-off depths of the silent heavens. The heavens cannot be measured, no plummet can reach to the deep foundations of the earth. We are surrounded by a universe which to our apprehensions is boundless. How much more so from expansions of our conceptions of celestial magnitudes since Jeremiah’s days, and what is to be the lesson from that? That we are insignificant atoms in this mighty whole? that God is far away from us? that the material stretches so far that perhaps there is nothing beyond?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The thought of faith is that the material immensity teaches me my God’s infinity, and especially His inexhaustible patience with us sinners. It teaches us the unfathomed depths of His gracious heart, and the abysses of His mysterious providence, and the unbounded sweep of His long-suffering forgiveness. His forgiving forbearance reaches further than the limits of the heavens. Not till these can be measured will it be exhausted, and the seed of Israel cast off for what they have done.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> He, the Infinite Father, above all creation, mightier than it, is our true home, and living in Him we have an abode which can never be ‘dissolved,’ and above us stretch far-shining glories, unapproached masses of brightness, nebulae of blessedness, spaces where the eye fails and the imagination faints. All is ours, our eternal possession, the inexhaustible source of our joy. Astronomers tell of light which has been travelling for millenniums and has not yet reached this globe; but what is that to the flashing glories which through eternity shall pour on us from Him? So, then, our confidence should be firm and inexhaustible.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> God has written wondrous lessons in His creation. But they are hieroglyphs, of which the key is lost, till we hear Christ and learn of Him. God has set His glories in the heavens and the earth is full of His mercy, but these are lesser gifts than that which contains them all and transcends them all, even His Son by whom He made the worlds, and- mightier still-by whom He redeemed man. God has written His mercy in the heavens and His faithfulness in the clouds, but His mercy and His faithfulness are more commended to us in Him who was before all things, and of whom it is written: ‘As a vesture shalt Thou fold them up, but Thou art the same and Thy years shall not fail.’ God has confirmed the covenant of His love to us by the faithful witnesses in the heavens, but the love shall abide when they have perished. The heavens bend above us all, and over the head of every man the zenith stands. Every spot of this low earth is smiled upon by that serene apocalypse of the loving will of God. No lane is so narrow and foul in the great city, no spot is so bare and lonely in the waste desert, but that thither the sunlight comes, and there some patch of blue above beckons the downcast eye to look up. The day opens its broad bosom bathed in light, and shows the sun in the heavens, the Lord of light, to preach to us of the true light. The night opens deeper abysses and fills them with stars, to preach to us how fathomless and immense His loving kindnesses and tender mercy are. They are witnesses to thee, dear friend, whatsoever thy heart, whatsoever thy sins, whatsoever thy memories. No iniquity can shut out God’s forgiving love. You cannot build out the heavens. He will not be sent away; you cannot measure, you cannot conceive, you cannot exhaust, His pardoning love. No storms disturb that serene sky. It is always there, blazing down upon us unclouded with all its orbs. Trust Christ; and then as years roll on, you will find that infinite love growing ever greater to your loving eyes, and through eternity will move onwards in the happy atmosphere and boundless heaven of the inexhaustible, deep heart and changeless love of God.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/31.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>31:35-40 As surely as the heavenly bodies will continue their settled course, according to the will of their Creator, to the end of time, and as the raging sea obeys him, so surely will the Jews be continued a separate people.

"Behold, days are coming, saith Jahveh, when I will make with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah a new covenant; <a href="/jeremiah/31-32.htm">Jeremiah 31:32</a>. Not like the covenant that I made with their fathers on the day when I laid hold of their hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt, which covenant of mine they broke, though I had married them to myself, saith Jahveh; <a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>. But this is the covenant which I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith Jahveh: I will put my law within them, and on their heart will I write it; and I will become to them a God, and they shall be to me a people. <a href="/jeremiah/31-34.htm">Jeremiah 31:34</a>. And they shall no more teach every man his neighbour and every man his brother, saying, Know ye Jahveh, for all of them shall know me, from the least of them to the greatest of them, saith Jahveh; for I will pardon their iniquity, and their sins will I remember no more. <a href="/jeremiah/31-35.htm">Jeremiah 31:35</a>. Thus saith Jahveh, [who] gives the sun for light by day, and the ordinances of the moon and stars for light by night, who rouses the sea so that its waves roar, Jahveh of hosts is His name: <a href="/jeremiah/31-36.htm">Jeremiah 31:36</a>. If these ordinances move away from before me, saith Jahveh, then also will the seed of Israel cease to be a people before me for ever. <a href="/jeremiah/31-37.htm">Jeremiah 31:37</a>. Thus saith Jahveh: If the heavens above can be measured, and the foundations of the earth below can be searched out, then will I also reject all the seed of Israel because of all that they have done, saith Jahveh. <a href="/jeremiah/31-38.htm">Jeremiah 31:38</a>. Behold, days come, saith Jahveh, when the city shall be built for Jahveh, from the tower of Hananeel unto the gate of the corner, <a href="/jeremiah/31-39.htm">Jeremiah 31:39</a>. And the measuring-line shall once more go out straight over the hill of Gareb, and turn round towards Goah. <a href="/jeremiah/31-40.htm">Jeremiah 31:40</a>. And all the valley of the corpses and of the ashes, and all the fields unto the valley of Kidron, unto the corner of the gate of the horses towards the east, [shall be] holiness to Jahveh; it shall not be plucked up nor pulled down again for ever.<p>The re-establishment of Israel reaches its completion in the making of a new covenant, according to which the law of God is written in the hearts of the people; thereby Israel becomes in truth the people of the Lord, and the knowledge of God founded on the experience of the forgiveness of sins is such that there is no further need of any external means like mutual teaching about God (<a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>). This covenant is to endure for ever, like the unchangeable ordinances of nature (<a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-35.htm">Jeremiah 31:35-37</a>); and in consequence of this, Jerusalem shall be guilt as the holy city of God, which shall never be destroyed again (<a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-38.htm">Jeremiah 31:38-40</a>).<p><a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-32</a><p>&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514; &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; does not mean "to make an appointment," but "to conclude a covenant," to establish a relation of mutual duties and obligations. Every covenant which God concludes with men consists, on the side of God, in assurance of His favours and actual bestowal of them; these bind men to the keeping of the commands laid on them. The covenant which the Lord will make with all Israel in the future is called "a new covenant," as compared with that made with the fathers at Sinai, when the people were led out of Egypt; this latter is thus implicitly called the "old covenant." The words, "on the day when I took them by the hand," etc., must not be restricted, on the one side, to the day of the exodus from Egypt, nor, on the other, to the day when the covenant was solemnly made at Sinai; they rather refer to the whole time of the exodus, which did not reach its termination till the entrance into Canaan, though it culminated in the solemn admission of Israel, at Sinai, as the people of Jahveh; see on <a href="/jeremiah/7-22.htm">Jeremiah 7:22</a>. (On the punctuation of &#1492;&#1495;&#1494;&#1497;&#1511;&#1497;, cf. Ewald, 238, d, Olshaus. Gramm. 191,f.) &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; is not a conjunction, "quod, because," but a relative pronoun, and must be combined with &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497;, "which my covenant," i.e., which covenant of mine. "They" stands emphatically in contrast with "though I" in the following circumstantial clause, which literally means, "but I have married them to myself," or, "I was their husband." As to &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, see on <a href="/jeremiah/3-14.htm">Jeremiah 3:14</a>. Hengstenberg wrongly takes the words as a promise, "but I will marry them to myself;" this view, however, is incompatible with the perfect, and the position of the words as a contrast with "they broke."<p>(Note: In the citation of this passage in <a href="/hebrews/8-8.htm">Hebrews 8:8</a>., the words are quoted according to the lxx version, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#787;&#837;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#768; &#x3b7;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;, although this translation is incorrect, because the apostle does not use these words in proving any point. These same words, moreover, have been rendered by the lxx, in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-14.htm">Jeremiah 3:14</a>, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c9; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;.)<p>The two closely connected expressions indicate why a new covenant was necessary; there is no formal statement, however, of the reason, which is merely given in a subordinate and appended clause. For the proper reason why a new covenant is made is not that the people have broken the old one, but that, though Jahveh had united Israel to Himself, they have broken the covenant and thereby rendered it necessary to make a new one. God the Lord, in virtue of His unchangeable faithfulness, would not alter the relation He had Himself established in His love, but simply found it anew in a way which obviated the breaking of the covenant by Israel. For it was a defect connected with the covenant made with Israel at Sinai, that it could be broken on their part. This defect is not to exist in the new covenant which God will make in after times. The expression "after those (not these) days" is remarkable; &#1492;&#1492;&#1501; is not the same as &#1492;&#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;, and yet the days meant can only be the "coming days;" accordingly, it is "those days" (as in <a href="/jeremiah/31-29.htm">Jeremiah 31:29</a>) that are to be expected. The expression "after these days" is inexact, and probably owes its origin to the idea contained in the phrase "in the end of the days" (&#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514;, cf. <a href="/jeremiah/23-20.htm">Jeremiah 23:20</a>).</body></html>
