Here the prophet calls upon the Gentiles, not the Jews, to hear the word of the Lord, and to proclaim or make it known; and the event has proved that he did not do this but by the direction of the Divine Spirit, since the Gentiles were far more ready to hear and obey the word of God by Christ, and to receive his divine doctrine, and propagate it, than the Jews were. <span class="ital">Declare it in the isles afar off </span>— The Jews, as we have repeatedly seen, called all the countries <span class="ital">islands </span>to which they went by sea. <span class="ital">He that scattered Israel, </span>&c. — He that caused Israel to be carried away captive into various countries, and dispersed them over the face of the earth, <span class="ital">will gather </span>them into one body or people, <a href="/isaiah/11-12.htm" title="And he shall set up an ensign for the nations, and shall assemble the outcasts of Israel, and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth.">Isaiah 11:12</a>; <a href="/isaiah/27-12.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall beat off from the channel of the river to the stream of Egypt, and you shall be gathered one by one, O you children of Israel.">Isaiah 27:12</a>; <a href="/isaiah/54-7.htm" title="For a small moment have I forsaken you; but with great mercies will I gather you.">Isaiah 54:7</a>. <span class="ital">And keep him as a shepherd does his flock — </span>As God’s care over his people is often compared to that of a shepherd, so the office of the Messiah is described under the same character, <a href="/isaiah/40-11.htm" title="He shall feed his flock like a shepherd: he shall gather the lambs with his arm, and carry them in his bosom, and shall gently lead those that are with young.">Isaiah 40:11</a>, and particularly with respect to the Jews, after their conversion and restoration. <span class="ital">For the Lord hath redeemed Jacob, &c., from him that was stronger than he </span>— From those who by subtlety and power conquered him, and detained him captive; an emblem of that redemption which Christ obtains for us by vanquishing the devil, called <span class="ital">the strong one, </span><a href="/matthew/12-29.htm" title="Or else how can one enter into a strong man's house, and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong man? and then he will spoil his house.">Matthew 12:29</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/31.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>31:10-17 He that scattered Israel, knows where to find them. It is comfortable to observe the goodness of the Lord in the gifts of providence. But our souls are never valuable as gardens, unless watered with the dews of God's Spirit and grace. A precious promise follows, which will not have full accomplishment except in the heavenly Zion. Let them be satisfied of God's loving-kindness, and they will be satisfied with it, and desire no more to make them happy. Rachel is represented as rising from her grave, and refusing to be comforted, supposing her offspring rooted out. The murder of the children at Bethlehem, by Herod, Mt 2:16-18, in some degree fulfilled this prediction, but could not be its full meaning. If we have hope in the end, concerning an eternal inheritance, for ourselves and those belonging to us, all temporal afflictions may be borne, and will be for our good.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/31.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The isles - The coast land of the Mediterranean, used here to show that the most distant countries are to hear and marvel at Israel's wonderful restoration. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/31.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10.

God is not only the author of those judgments which come upon his people, but of their mercies; and his power in scattering them is enough to confirm us in a belief of his power to gather them. He will not only gather them, but keep and protect them when gathered; and thus God showeth himself their Shepherd: it is the work of a shepherd not only to call and gather his sheep together, but to watch over them, protect, and keep them, when they are so gathered together. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/31.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Hear the word of the Lord, O ye nations,.... The Gentiles: who are called upon to hear the word of the Gospel; the word of peace, reconciliation, and salvation by Christ, sent among them by him, for the calling and conversion of them, that they might believe in him, and profess his name: <p>and declare it in the isles afar off; having heard, received, and embraced the Gospel themselves, it became them to make it known to others; not only to those upon the continent and the isles adjacent, but to those afar off from it; such as these isles of ours, of Great Britain and Ireland; where, blessed be the Lord, this Gospel has been declared to the conversion and comfort of many, and to the glory of Christ: <p>and say, he that scattered Israel will gather him: that is, the Lord that hath scattered the Jews throughout the nations of the world, and even in the isles afar off, will before long gather them together, and bring them into their own land. This may be understood of the spiritual Israel, be they Jews or Gentiles, the children of God scattered up and down in the world; and who, by reason of sin, and while in an unregenerate estate, are alienated from God, and at a distance from him; but are gathered together in one head, Christ, when he died for them, and redeemed them; and in the effectual calling, when they are gathered to God and Christ, one by one; and afterwards to more near communion with them; and, at last, to glory, and which is the sum and substance of the Gospel to be heard and declared: <p>and keep him as a shepherd doth his flock; so that they shall be scattered no more, as the Jews have been; nor any of them lost, as God's elect were in their first head Adam: they are Christ's flock, given him by the Father, and purchased with his blood; and having gathered them as above, he will keep them in his hands, from whence none can pluck them, and preserve them by his almighty power unto salvation; which doctrine of the saints' perseverance is a most comfortable doctrine of the Gospel to be published and declared. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/31.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Hear the word of the LORD, O ye nations, and declare it in the isles afar off, and say, He that scattered Israel will gather him, and keep him, as a shepherd doth his flock.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/31.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">10</span>.

Jeremiah says that his eye 'shall run down with tears, because the flock of Jehovah is carried away captive' (<a href="/jeremiah/13-17.htm">Jeremiah 13:17</a>). The change in the fortunes of the Jews is compared by the prophets to a shepherd's seeking his lost sheep, and feeding them again in green pastures (<a href="/jeremiah/31-10.htm">Jeremiah 31:10</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/1-19.htm">Jeremiah 1:19</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/34-11.htm">Ezekiel 34:11-16</a>). The reference is not so much to the homeward journey of the exiles as to the state of temporal and spiritual happiness in which they would find themselves on their return. The same figures occur in a psalm, where a reference to the return from exile is excluded by the pre-exile date, '... feed them also, and carry them forever' (<a href="/psalms/28-9.htm">Psalm 28:9</a>)" (from the writer's note on Isaiah 40:11). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/31.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Israel is now to be built up again, i.e., to be raised to a permanent condition of ever-increasing prosperity; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/12-16.htm">Jeremiah 12:16</a>. The additional clause, "and thou shalt be built," confirms this promise. The "virgin of Israel" is the congregation of Israel; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/14-17.htm">Jeremiah 14:17</a>. A new and joyful phase in the life of the people is to begin: such is the meaning of the words, "with tabrets shalt thou adorn thyself, and thou shalt go forth in the dance of those who make merry." In this manner were the popular feasts celebrated in Israel; cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/11-34.htm">Judges 11:34</a>, <a href="/psalms/66-26.htm">Psalm 66:26</a>.</body></html>
