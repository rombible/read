Babylon is abundant in treasures, yet neither her waters nor her wealth shall secure her. Destruction comes when they did not think of it. Wherever we are, in the greatest depths, at the greatest distances, we are to remember the Lord our God; and in the times of the greatest fears and hopes, it is most needful to remember the Lord. The feeling excited by Babylon's fall is the same with the New Testament Babylon, Re 18:9,19. The ruin of all who support idolatry, infidelity, and superstition, is needful for the revival of true godliness; and the threatening prophecies of Scripture yield comfort in this view. The great seat of antichristian tyranny, idolatry, and superstition, the persecutor of true Christians, is as certainly doomed to destruction as ancient Babylon. Then will vast multitudes mourn for sin, and seek the Lord. Then will the lost sheep of the house of Israel be brought back to the fold of the good Shepherd, and stray no more. And the exact fulfilment of these ancient prophecies encourages us to faith in all the promises and prophecies of the sacred Scriptures.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/51.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Render, "As Babylon caused the slain of Israel to fall, so because of Babylon, hare fallen the slain of (or, in) the whole earth."

Henderson translates, "Babylon also shall fall, ye slain of Israel. Those also of Babylon shall fall, O ye slain of all the earth." But, "in the midst of her," Jer 51:47, plainly answers to "at Babylon," Jer 51:49, English Version.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/51.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The words in the Hebrew have some difficulty, which is not so obvious to those not acquainted with that language, but hath given occasion to interpreters to vary in their particular translations of it; but they mostly agree in the general sense, viz. that these words are given as a reason why the whole earth should so much rejoice in the ruin of Babylon, because Babylon had caused Israel to fall. The latter term, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">all the earth, </span> must be understood in a restrained sense, for <span class="ital">that earth</span>; the Chaldeans coming up from all parts of Chaldea to help Babylon, should be slain there, as by the means of Babylon the Israelites were slain that came up from all parts of Judea to help Jerusalem. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/51.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>As Babylon hath caused the slain of Israel,.... In Jerusalem, when that city was taken the Chaldeans, and destroyed: <p>so at Babylon shall all the slain of all the earth; or "land"; that is, the land of Chaldea; the inhabitants of which fled to Babylon upon the invasion of the Medes and Persians, both for their own safety, and the defence of that city; and where, being slain, they fell; and this was a just retaliation of them for what they had done to Israel. These words may be considered, as they are by some, as the song of the inhabitants of heaven and earth, observing and applauding the justice and equity of divine Providence in this affair; see <a href="/revelation/13-7.htm">Revelation 13:7</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/51.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">As Babylon <i>hath caused</i> the <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> slain of Israel to fall, so at Babylon shall fall the slain of all the earth.</span><p>(d) Babylon not only destroyed Israel, but many other nations.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/51.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">49</span>. <span class="ital">As Babylon … so at, etc</span>.] better, as mg. <span class="ital">Both Babylon is to fall, O ye slain of Israel, and at, etc</span>., or, repeating a Heb. consonant, <span class="ital">for the slain of Israel</span>.

Ewald and others render thus: "Not only must Babylon fall, O ye slain ones of Israel, but slain ones of the whole earth have fallen because of Babylon." But why this address to the slain ones of Israel? Besides, the antithesis indicated in the Hebrew is thereby destroyed. Hell explains the antithesis thus: "Just as Babylon was intent on the fall of slain ones in Israel, so also there fall because of Babylonian slain ones of all the earth," viz. because there are to be found, in the capital of the empire, people from all quarters of the world, who are slain when Babylon is conquered. A better antithesis seems to be gained if we follow the Peshito, and read, at the end of the verse, "in the whole earth." It will then be asserted by the prophet that, just as Babylon was the cause of the slaying of Israelites, so (as a punishment) the Babylonian fugitives shall be slain wherever they may wander. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/51.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Description of the fall. The sea that has come over Babylon and covered it with its waves, was taken figuratively, even by the Chaldee paraphrasts, and understood as meaning the hostile army that overwhelms the land with its hosts. Only J. D. Michaelis was inclined to take the words in their proper meaning, and understood them as referring to the inundation of Babylon by the Euphrates in August and in winter. But however true it may be, that, in consequence of the destruction or decay of the great river-walls built by Nebuchadnezzar, the Euphrates may inundate the city of Babylon when it wells into a flood, yet the literal acceptation of the words is unwarranted, for the simple reason that they do not speak of any momentary or temporary inundation, and that, because Babylon is to be covered with water, the cities of Babylonia are to become an arid steppe. The sea is therefore the sea of nations, cf. <a href="/jeremiah/46-7.htm">Jeremiah 46:7</a>; the description reminds us of the destruction of Pharaoh and his host in the Red Sea. On <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-43.htm">Jeremiah 51:43</a>, cf. <a href="/jeremiah/48-9.htm">Jeremiah 48:9</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-18.htm">Jeremiah 49:18</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/49-33.htm">Jeremiah 49:33</a>., <a href="/jeremiah/50-12.htm">Jeremiah 50:12</a>. The suffix in &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1503; refers to "her cities;" but the repetition of &#1488;&#1512;&#1509; is not for that reason wrong, as Graf thinks, but is to be explained on the ground that the cities of Babylonia are compared to a barren land; and the idea is properly this: The cities become an arid country of steppes, a land in whose cities nobody can dwell. </body></html>
