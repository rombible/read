and I will make the cities of Judah desolate, without an inhabitant.">Jeremiah 9:11</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/19-8.htm" title="And I will make this city desolate, and an hissing; every one that passes thereby shall be astonished and hiss because of all the plagues thereof.">Jeremiah 19:8</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/25-9.htm" title="Behold, I will send and take all the families of the north, said the LORD, and Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will bring them against this land, and against the inhabitants thereof, and against all these nations round about, and will utterly destroy them, and make them an astonishment, and an hissing, and perpetual desolations.">Jeremiah 25:9</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/25-18.htm" title="To wit, Jerusalem, and the cities of Judah, and the kings thereof, and the princes thereof, to make them a desolation, an astonishment, an hissing, and a curse; as it is this day;">Jeremiah 25:18</a>. Nothing is more characteristic of the present aspect of Babylon than the “heaps” or mounds of brickwork, fragments of pottery and earth, that are now scattered over the plain, and are slowly yielding up their records of the past to explorers. The “dragons” here (not the same word as in <a href="/jeremiah/51-34.htm" title="Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon has devoured me, he has crushed me, he has made me an empty vessel, he has swallowed me up like a dragon, he has filled his belly with my delicates, he has cast me out.">Jeremiah 51:34</a>) are the “jackals” that howl in the ruins. (See Note on <a href="/jeremiah/10-22.htm" title="Behold, the noise of the bruit is come, and a great commotion out of the north country, to make the cities of Judah desolate, and a den of dragons.">Jeremiah 10:22</a>.)<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/51.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>51:1-58 The particulars of this prophecy are dispersed and interwoven, and the same things left and returned to again. Babylon is abundant in treasures, yet neither her waters nor her wealth shall secure her. Destruction comes when they did not think of it. Wherever we are, in the greatest depths, at the greatest distances, we are to remember the Lord our God; and in the times of the greatest fears and hopes, it is most needful to remember the Lord. The feeling excited by Babylon's fall is the same with the New Testament Babylon, Re 18:9,19. The ruin of all who support idolatry, infidelity, and superstition, is needful for the revival of true godliness; and the threatening prophecies of Scripture yield comfort in this view. The great seat of antichristian tyranny, idolatry, and superstition, the persecutor of true Christians, is as certainly doomed to destruction as ancient Babylon. Then will vast multitudes mourn for sin, and seek the Lord. Then will the lost sheep of the house of Israel be brought back to the fold of the good Shepherd, and stray no more. And the exact fulfilment of these ancient prophecies encourages us to faith in all the promises and prophecies of the sacred Scriptures.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/51.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Heaps - Of rubbish, formed in this case by the decay of the unburned bricks of which Babylon was built.

The mighty men of Babylon cease to offer resistance, and withdraw dispirited, like women, into inaccessible places, while the enemy sets fire to the houses, breaks the bars, and captures the city. The prophet views all this in spirit as already present, and depicts in lively colours the attack on the city and its capture. Hence the historic tenses, &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1506;&#1513;&#1473;, &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1500;, &#1495;&#1491;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;, etc. &#1511;&#1502;&#1492; is used of the permanence, i.e., of the realization of the divine counsels, as in <a href="/jeremiah/44-23.htm">Jeremiah 44:23</a>. On the singular, see Ewald, 317, a. "To make the land," etc., as in <a href="/jeremiah/4-7.htm">Jeremiah 4:7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-16.htm">Jeremiah 18:16</a>, etc. "They sit (have taken up their position) in the strongholds" (Mountain fastnesses), i.e., in inaccessible places; cf. <a href="/1_samuel/13-16.htm">1 Samuel 13:16</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/23-14.htm">2 Samuel 23:14</a>. &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1492; is but to be regarded as a Kal form from &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;; on its derivation from &#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1514;, see on <a href="/isaiah/41-17.htm">Isaiah 41:17</a>. "They have become women;" cf. <a href="/jeremiah/50-37.htm">Jeremiah 50:37</a>. The subject of the verb &#1492;&#1510;&#1468;&#1497;&#1506;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468; is the enemy, who set fire to the dwellings in Babylon. "Runner runs against runner," i.e., from opposite sides of the city there come messengers, who meet each other running to tell the king in his castle that the city is taken. The king is therefore (as Graf correctly remarks against Hitzig) not to be thought of as living outside of the city, for "in this case &#1500;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488;&#1514; would have no meaning," but as living in the royal castle, which was situated in the middle of the city, on the Euphrates. Inasmuch as the city is taken "from the end" (&#1502;&#1511;&#1468;&#1510;&#1492;), i.e., on all sides, the messengers who bring the news to the king's fortress must meet each other. </body></html>
