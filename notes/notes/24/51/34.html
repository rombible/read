Babylon is abundant in treasures, yet neither her waters nor her wealth shall secure her. Destruction comes when they did not think of it. Wherever we are, in the greatest depths, at the greatest distances, we are to remember the Lord our God; and in the times of the greatest fears and hopes, it is most needful to remember the Lord. The feeling excited by Babylon's fall is the same with the New Testament Babylon, Re 18:9,19. The ruin of all who support idolatry, infidelity, and superstition, is needful for the revival of true godliness; and the threatening prophecies of Scripture yield comfort in this view. The great seat of antichristian tyranny, idolatry, and superstition, the persecutor of true Christians, is as certainly doomed to destruction as ancient Babylon. Then will vast multitudes mourn for sin, and seek the Lord. Then will the lost sheep of the house of Israel be brought back to the fold of the good Shepherd, and stray no more. And the exact fulfilment of these ancient prophecies encourages us to faith in all the promises and prophecies of the sacred Scriptures.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/51.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Literally, "Nebuchadrezzar ... hath devoured us, hath crushed us, he hath set as aside as an empty vessel, he hath swallowed as like a crocodile, he hath filled his maw with my delicacies <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/49-20.htm">Genesis 49:20</a>, he hath cast us out.

"Lift up a standard on the earth, sound a trumpet among the nations, prepare the nations against her, call the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz against her; appoint troops against her; bring up horses lie horrid locusts. <a href="/jeremiah/51-28.htm">Jeremiah 51:28</a>. Prepare nations against her, the kings of the Medes and her governors, and all her lieutenant-governors, and all the land of his dominion. <a href="/jeremiah/51-29.htm">Jeremiah 51:29</a>. Then the earth quakes and trembles: for the purposes of Jahveh against Babylon are being performed, to make the land of Babylon a desolation, without an inhabitant. <a href="/jeremiah/51-30.htm">Jeremiah 51:30</a>. The heroes of Babylon have ceased to fight, they sit in the strongholds: their strength is dried up; they have become women; they have set her habitations on fire; her bars are broken. <a href="/jeremiah/51-31.htm">Jeremiah 51:31</a>. One runner runs against another, and one messenger against another, to tell the king of Babylon that his city is wholly taken. <a href="/jeremiah/51-32.htm">Jeremiah 51:32</a>. And the crossing-places have been seized, and the marches have they burned up with fire, and the men of war are confounded. <a href="/jeremiah/51-33.htm">Jeremiah 51:33</a>. For thus saith Jahveh of hosts, the God of Israel: The daughter of Babylon is like a threshing-floor at the time when it is trodden; yet a little, and the time of harvest will come to her. <a href="/jeremiah/51-34.htm">Jeremiah 51:34</a>. Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon hath devoured us, and ground us down; he hath set us down [like] an empty vessel, he hath swallowed us like a dragon, he hath filled his belly with my dainties; he hath thrust me out. <a href="/jeremiah/51-35.htm">Jeremiah 51:35</a>. Let the inhabitress of Zion say, 'My wrong and my flesh [be] upon Babylon;' and let Jerusalem say, 'My blood be upon the inhabitants of Chaldea.' <a href="/jeremiah/51-36.htm">Jeremiah 51:36</a>. Therefore thus saith Jahveh: Behold, I will plead thy cause, and execute vengeance for thee; ad I will dry up her sea, and make her fountain dry. <a href="/jeremiah/51-37.htm">Jeremiah 51:37</a>. And Babylon shall become heaps [of ruins], a dwelling-place of dragons, an astonishment, and a hissing, without an inhabitant."<p>The lifting up of the standard (<a href="/jeremiah/51-27.htm">Jeremiah 51:27</a>) serves as a signal for the nations to assemble for the struggle against Babylon. &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; does not mean "in the land," but, as the parallel "among the nations" shows, "on the earth." &#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;, "consecrate prepare against her (Babylon) nations" for the war; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/6-4.htm">Jeremiah 6:4</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/22-7.htm">Jeremiah 22:7</a>. &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;, as in <a href="/jeremiah/50-29.htm">Jeremiah 50:29</a>. The kingdoms summoned are: Ararat, i.e., the middle (or eastern) province of Armenia, in the plain of Araxes, which Moses of Chorene calls Arairad, Araratia (see on <a href="/genesis/8-4.htm">Genesis 8:4</a>); Minni, which, according to the Syriac and Chaldee, is also a name of Armenia, probably its western province (see Gesenius' Thesaurus, p. 807); and Ashkenaz, which the Jews take to be Germany, although only this much is certain, that it is a province in the neighbourhood of Armenia. For Aske&#770;n is an Armenian proper name, and az an Armenian termination; cf. Lagarde's Gesammelte Abhandll. S. 254, and Delitzsch on <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/10-3.htm">Genesis 10:3</a>, <a href="/genesis/10-4.htm">Genesis 10:4</a> ed. &#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;, "appoint, order against her." &#1496;&#1508;&#1505;&#1512; does not mean "captains" or leaders, for this meaning of the foreign word (supposed to be Assyrian) rests on a very uncertain etymology; it means some peculiar kind of troops, but nothing more definite can be affirmed regarding it. This meaning is required by the context both here and in <a href="//biblehub.com/nahum/3-17.htm">Nahum 3:17</a>, the only other place where the word occurs: see on that passage. The sing. &#1496;&#1508;&#1505;&#1512; corresponds with the sing. &#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;, and is therefore to be taken collectively, "troops and horses." Whether the simile &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;&#1511; &#1505; belongs merely to "horses," or to the combination "troops and horses," depends on the meaning attached to the expression. Modern expositors render it "bristly locusts;" and by that they understand, like Credner (Joel, S. 298), the young grasshopper after it has laid aside its third skin, when the wings are still enveloped in rough horny sheaths, and stick straight up from the back of the animal. But this explanation rests on an erroneous interpretation of <a href="/nahum/3-17.htm">Nahum 3:17</a>. &#1505;&#1502;&#1512; means to shudder, and is used of the shivering or quivering of the body (<a href="/psalms/119-120.htm">Psalm 119:120</a>), and of the hair (<a href="/job/4-15.htm">Job 4:15</a>); and &#1497;&#1500;&#1511; does not mean a particular kind of locusts, through Jerome, on <a href="//biblehub.com/nahum/3-17.htm">Nahum 3:17</a>, renders it attelabus (parva locusta est inter locustam et bruchum, et modicis pennis reptans potius quam volans, semperque subsiliens), but is a poetic epithet of the locust, "the devourer." If any one prefers to view &#1505;&#1502;&#1512; as referring to the nature of the locusts, he may with Bochart and Rosenmller, think of the locustarum species, quae habet caput hirsutum. But the epithet "horrid" is probably intended merely to point out the locusts as a fearful scourge of the country. On this view, the comparison refers to both clauses, and is meant to set forth not merely the enormous multitude of the soldiery, but also the devastation they make of the country. In <a href="/jeremiah/51-28.htm">Jeremiah 51:28</a> mention is further made of the kings of the Medes (see on <a href="/jeremiah/51-11.htm">Jeremiah 51:11</a>), together with their governors and lieutenant-governors (see on <a href="/jeremiah/51-23.htm">Jeremiah 51:23</a>), and, in order to give prominence to the immense strength of the army, of "all the land of his dominion;" on these expressions, cf. <a href="/jeremiah/34-1.htm">Jeremiah 34:1</a> and <a href="/1_kings/9-19.htm">1 Kings 9:19</a>. The suffix refers to the king of Media, as the leader of the whole army; while those in "her governors, and all her lieutenant-governors," refer to the country of Media. </body></html>
