Babylon is abundant in treasures, yet neither her waters nor her wealth shall secure her. Destruction comes when they did not think of it. Wherever we are, in the greatest depths, at the greatest distances, we are to remember the Lord our God; and in the times of the greatest fears and hopes, it is most needful to remember the Lord. The feeling excited by Babylon's fall is the same with the New Testament Babylon, Re 18:9,19. The ruin of all who support idolatry, infidelity, and superstition, is needful for the revival of true godliness; and the threatening prophecies of Scripture yield comfort in this view. The great seat of antichristian tyranny, idolatry, and superstition, the persecutor of true Christians, is as certainly doomed to destruction as ancient Babylon. Then will vast multitudes mourn for sin, and seek the Lord. Then will the lost sheep of the house of Israel be brought back to the fold of the good Shepherd, and stray no more. And the exact fulfilment of these ancient prophecies encourages us to faith in all the promises and prophecies of the sacred Scriptures.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/51.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Rather, "Surely I have filled thee with men as with locusts, and they shall sing over thee the vintage-song."

But the expression, "to fill a city with men," is more naturally taken of the increase of the population of the city; and it is better to render, with Ewald and Keil, "Even though [or, 'Surely even though'] I have filled thee with men, as with locusts, they shall raise over thee the cheer of the vintage;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the millions of Babylon's population will not save her from the most utter ruin. For the vintage cheer, see on Jeremiah 25:30; and for the figures, see especially, <a href="/isaiah/63-1.htm">Isaiah 63:1-6</a>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/51.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Babylon, certainly, in its former power and greatness, was a golden goblet, by means of which Jahveh presented to the nations the wine of His wrath, and intoxicated them; but now it is fallen, and broken without remedy. <a href="/isaiah/21-9.htm">Isaiah 21:9</a> finds an echo in the expression, "Babylon is fallen." The figure of the cup refers us back to <a href="/jeremiah/25-15.htm">Jeremiah 25:15</a>., where, however, it is applied in a different way. The cup is said to be of gold, in order to point out the splendour and glory of Nebuchadnezzar's dominion. "In the hand of Jahveh," i.e., used by Him as His instrument for pouring out His wrath to the nations. But Babylon has suddenly fallen and been broken in pieces. At this point Jeremiah drops the figure of the cup, for a golden cup does not break when it falls. The fall is so terrible, that the nations in Babylon are summoned to participate in the lamentation, and to lend their aid in repairing her injuries. But they answer that their attempts to heal her are fruitless. (On &#1510;&#1512;&#1497;, cf. <a href="/jeremiah/46-11.htm">Jeremiah 46:11</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/8-22.htm">Jeremiah 8:22</a>.) The terrible and irreparable character of the fall is thus expressed in a dramatic manner. We must neither think of the allies and mercenaries as those who are addressed (Schnurrer, Rosenmller, Maurer, Hitzig), nor merely the Israelites who had been delivered from Babylon (Umbreit). The latter view is opposed by the words which follow, "Let every one go to his own country;" this points to men out of different lands. And the former assumption is opposed by the consideration that not merely the mercenaries, but also the allies are to be viewed as fallen and ruined together with Babylon, and that Babylon, which had subdued all the nations, has no allies, according to the general way in which the prophet views these things. Those addressed are rather the nations that had been vanquished by Babylon and detained in the city, of which Israel was one. Inasmuch as these were the servants of Babylon, and as such bound to pay her service, they are to heal Babylon; and because the attempts to heal her prove fruitless, they are to leave the ruined city. They answer this summons by the resolve, "We will go every one to his own land;" cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-8.htm">Jeremiah 50:8</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/50-16.htm">Jeremiah 50:16</a>. The motive for this resolution, "for her guilt reaches up to heaven," certainly shows that it is Israelites who are speaking, because it is only they who form their opinions in such a way; but they speak in the name of all the strangers who are in Babylon. &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496; is the matter upon which judgment is passed, i.e., the transgression, the guilt, analogous to &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496; &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-23.htm">Ezekiel 7:23</a>, and &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496; &#1502;&#1493;&#1514; , <a href="/deuteronomy/19-6.htm">Deuteronomy 19:6</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/21-22.htm">Deuteronomy 21:22</a>; it does not mean the punishment adjudged, of which we cannot say that it reaches up to heaven. On this expression, cf. <a href="/psalms/57-11.htm">Psalm 57:11</a>; <a href="/psalms/108-5.htm">Psalm 108:5</a>. Through the fall of Babylon, the Lord has made manifest the righteousness of Israel; the redeemed ones are to proclaim this in Zion. &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1493;&#1514; does not mean "righteous acts" (<a href="/judges/5-11.htm">Judges 5:11</a>), but proofs of the righteousness of Israel as opposed to Babylon, which righteousness Babylon, through tyrannical oppression of the people that had been delivered up to it merely for chastisement, has failed to perceive, and which, so long as the Lord did not take His people to Himself again in a visible manner, was hidden from the world; cf. <a href="/psalms/37-6.htm">Psalm 37:6</a>.</body></html>
