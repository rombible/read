Babylon is abundant in treasures, yet neither her waters nor her wealth shall secure her. Destruction comes when they did not think of it. Wherever we are, in the greatest depths, at the greatest distances, we are to remember the Lord our God; and in the times of the greatest fears and hopes, it is most needful to remember the Lord. The feeling excited by Babylon's fall is the same with the New Testament Babylon, Re 18:9,19. The ruin of all who support idolatry, infidelity, and superstition, is needful for the revival of true godliness; and the threatening prophecies of Scripture yield comfort in this view. The great seat of antichristian tyranny, idolatry, and superstition, the persecutor of true Christians, is as certainly doomed to destruction as ancient Babylon. Then will vast multitudes mourn for sin, and seek the Lord. Then will the lost sheep of the house of Israel be brought back to the fold of the good Shepherd, and stray no more. And the exact fulfilment of these ancient prophecies encourages us to faith in all the promises and prophecies of the sacred Scriptures.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/51.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Sheshach - Babylon: see the <a href="/jeremiah/51-1.htm">Jeremiah 51:1</a> note.<p>Surprised - i. e., seized, captured. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/51.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>41.

"Nebuchadnezzar has devoured us," i.e., oppressed us. The plural suffixes to the verbs have been needlessly changed in the Qeri into singulars, for the simple reason, perhaps, that with &#1502;&#1506;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497; and in <a href="/jeremiah/51-35.htm">Jeremiah 51:35</a> the address makes a transition into the singular. &#1492;&#1502;&#1501; signifies to throw enemies into confusion by causing a panic, for the purpose of destroying them; hence to destroy, see on <a href="/deuteronomy/2-15.htm">Deuteronomy 2:15</a>; here to destroy, crush.

This wrong is more fully specified, with reference to the figure of swallowing, by "my flesh and blood;" cf. <a href="/micah/3-3.htm">Micah 3:3</a>. The Lord will avenge this wrong, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-36.htm">Jeremiah 51:36</a>, cf. <a href="/jeremiah/50-34.htm">Jeremiah 50:34</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-6.htm">Jeremiah 51:6</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/51-11.htm">Jeremiah 51:11</a>; He will also dry up the sea of Babylon, and make her spring dry up.

The sea of Babylon is the Euphrates, with its canals, lakes, and marshes, i.e., the abundance of water to which Babylonia owed its fertility, and the city its influence as the centre of the then known world. Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/21-1.htm">Isaiah 21:1</a>) accordingly calls Babylon, emblematically, the desert of the sea, inasmuch as the region in which Babylon stands is a plain, broken in such a manner by the Euphrates, as well as by marshes and lakes, as that the city, so to speak, swims in the sea (Delitzsch). The source of spring of the sea is the Euphrates, and the drying up of this spring is not to be understood literally of the drying up of the Euphrates, but signifies a drying up of the springs of water that fertilize the country.
