It shows great perverseness in sin, when men make afflictions excuses for sin, which are sent to part between them and their sins. Here is an earnest exhortation to reform. God must be served in the first place; and the interest of our souls ought to be preferred before that of our bodies. Let them trust God to provide for their comfort. God has blessings ready for us, but through the weakness of our faith and the narrowness of our desires, we have not room to receive them.

The introduction of the prophet's name in the heading in <a href="/zechariah/7-8.htm">Zechariah 7:8</a> does not warrant the strange opinion held by Schmieder and Schlier - namely, that our prophet is here reproducing the words of an earlier Zechariah who lived before the captivity - but is merely to be attributed to a variation in the form of expression. This divine word was as follows: <a href="/zechariah/7-9.htm">Zechariah 7:9</a>. "Thus hath Jehovah of hosts spoken, saying, Execute judgment of truth, and show love and compassion one to another. <a href="/zechariah/7-10.htm">Zechariah 7:10</a>. And widows and orphans, strangers and destitute ones, oppress not; and meditate not in your heart the injury of every brother. <a href="/zechariah/7-11.htm">Zechariah 7:11</a>. But they refused to attend, and offered a rebellious shoulder, and hardened their ears that they might not hear. <a href="/zechariah/7-12.htm">Zechariah 7:12</a>. And they made their heart diamond, that they might not hear the law and the words which Jehovah of hosts sent through His Spirit by means of the former prophet, so that great wrath came from Jehovah of hosts." &#1499;&#1468;&#1492; &#1488;&#1502;&#1512; is to be taken as a preterite here, referring to what Jehovah had caused to be proclaimed to the people before the captivity. The kernel of this announcement consisted in the appeal to the people, to keep the moral precepts of the law, to practise the true love of the neighbour in public life and private intercourse. Mishpat 'e&#774;meth, judgment of truth (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/18-8.htm">Ezekiel 18:8</a>), is such an administration of justice as simply fixes the eye upon the real circumstances of any dispute, without any personal considerations whatever, and decides them in accordance with truth. For the fact itself, compare <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/22-20.htm">Exodus 22:20</a>, <a href="/exodus/22-21.htm">Exodus 22:21</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/23-6.htm">Exodus 23:6-9</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/19-15.htm">Leviticus 19:15-18</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-18.htm">Deuteronomy 10:18-19</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/24-14.htm">Deuteronomy 24:14</a>; <a href="/isaiah/1-17.htm">Isaiah 1:17</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-5.htm">Jeremiah 7:5-6</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/22-3.htm">Jeremiah 22:3</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/18-8.htm">Ezekiel 18:8</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/12-7.htm">Hosea 12:7</a>, etc. &#1512;&#1506;&#1514; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1488;&#1495;&#1497;&#1493;, the injury of a man who is his brother (as in <a href="/genesis/9-5.htm">Genesis 9:5</a>); not "injury one towards another," which would suppose a transposition of the &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;  equals  &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1512;&#1506;&#1514; &#1488;&#1495;&#1497;&#1493;. In <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/7-11.htm">Zechariah 7:11</a>, <a href="/zechariah/7-12.htm">Zechariah 7:12</a> the attitude of the people towards these admonitions of God is described. Na&#770;than ka&#770;the&#772;ph so&#772;rereth: to give or offer a rebellious shoulder, as in <a href="/nehemiah/9-29.htm">Nehemiah 9:29</a>. The figure is borrowed from an ox, which will not allow a yoke to be placed upon its neck (cf. <a href="/hosea/4-16.htm">Hosea 4:16</a>). To make the ears heavy (hikhb&#305;&#772;d), away from hearing, i.e., so that they do not hear (cf. <a href="/isaiah/6-10.htm">Isaiah 6:10</a>). To make the heart diamond (sha&#770;m&#305;&#772;r), i.e., as hard as diamond. A stony heart is a heart not susceptible to impressions (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/11-19.htm">Ezekiel 11:19</a>). The relative &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; before sha&#770;lach refers to the two nouns named before, viz., to&#772;ra&#770;h and debha&#770;r&#305;&#772;m, though we need not on that account take to&#772;ra&#770;h in the general sense of instruction. God also sent the law to the people through the prophets, i.e., caused them to preach it and impress it upon their hearts. The consequence of this obduracy of the people was, that "there arose great wrath from Jehovah" (cf. <a href="/zechariah/1-2.htm">Zechariah 1:2</a>; <a href="/2_kings/3-27.htm">2 Kings 3:27</a>). </body></html>
