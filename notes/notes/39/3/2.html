</span>So also the Chaldee. “Quare hoc?” “Why this?” says Grotius: “Because he himself shall bear the cross, that he may come to the kingdom, and shall show the same way to his followers.” <span class="ital">The day of his coming, </span>with respect to the Jews, includes all the time from the beginning of his preaching, to the total destruction of their temple and city by the Romans: and his coming, here and in several other places, comprehends all the effects and consequences of his coming, as well the judgments which arose from it to the disobedient, as the mercy that flowed from it to the obedient. So that the meaning of the question is, Who shall be able to stand under the weight of those trials and tribulations which at that time will fall on all sorts of men? great crosses being to be borne by the believing and pious, and great calamities to be endured by the unbelieving and refractory. In the same light John the Baptist represents the effects of Christ’s coming, <a href="/context/matthew/3-7.htm" title="But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism, he said to them, O generation of vipers, who has warned you to flee from the wrath to come?...">Matthew 3:7-12</a>, <span class="ital">Who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come? </span>meaning, primarily, the wrath about to come on that rebellious people: <span class="ital">whose fan, </span>he adds, <span class="ital">is in his hand, and he will thoroughly purge his floor, and burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire. For he is like a refiner’s fire — </span>As if he had said, Some men are like <span class="ital">metals, </span>mixed with much dross, which nothing but a fierce fire can purge away. Such a fire shall the troubles of these days be. The divine judgments are often called a fiery trial, such as separates the pure metal from the dross, purifying the former and consuming the latter. See <a href="/isaiah/1-25.htm" title="And I will turn my hand on you, and purely purge away your dross, and take away all your tin:">Isaiah 1:25</a>; <a href="/isaiah/4-4.htm" title="When the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the middle thereof by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning.">Isaiah 4:4</a>; <a href="/zechariah/13-9.htm" title="And I will bring the third part through the fire, and will refine them as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried: they shall call on my name, and I will hear them: I will say, It is my people: and they shall say, The LORD is my God.">Zechariah 13:9</a>. Our Lord is to be understood in the same sense, <a href="/luke/12-49.htm" title="I am come to send fire on the earth; and what will I, if it be already kindled?">Luke 12:49</a>, where he says, <span class="ital">I am come to send fire upon the earth, </span>namely, a fire of trial and purgation, to try and purify the hearts and reins of men, and find out and separate the good from the bad; like as the refiner’s fire makes the dross of the metal to appear and fly off. <span class="ital">And like fuller’s soap — </span>The word <span class="greekheb">ברית</span>, here rendered <span class="ital">soap, </span>and <a href="/jeremiah/2-22.htm" title="For though you wash you with nitre, and take you much soap, yet your iniquity is marked before me, said the Lord GOD.">Jeremiah 2:22</a>, according to St. Jerome, was an herb growing in Palestine, which the fullers used to take spots out of clothes,<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/malachi/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:1-6 The first words of this chapter seem an answer to the scoffers of those days. Here is a prophecy of the appearing of John the Baptist. He is Christ's harbinger. He shall prepare the way before him, by calling men to repentance. The Messiah had been long called, He that should come, and now shortly he will come. He is the Messenger of the covenant. Those who seek Jesus, shall find pleasure in him, often when not looked for. The Lord Jesus, prepares the sinner's heart to be his temple, by the ministry of his word and the convictions of his Spirit, and he enters it as the Messenger of peace and consolation. No hypocrite or formalist can endure his doctrine, or stand before his tribunal. Christ came to distinguish men, to separate between the precious and the vile. He shall sit as a Refiner. Christ, by his gospel, shall purify and reform his church, and by his Spirit working with it, shall regenerate and cleanse souls. He will take away the dross found in them. He will separate their corruptions, which render their faculties worthless and useless. The believer needs not fear the fiery trial of afflictions and temptations, by which the Saviour refines his gold. He will take care it is not more intense or longer than is needful for his good; and this trial will end far otherwise than that of the wicked. Christ will, by interceding for them, make them accepted. Where no fear of God is, no good is to be expected. Evil pursues sinners. God is unchangeable. And though the sentence against evil works be not executed speedily, yet it will be executed; the Lord is as much an enemy to sin as ever. We may all apply this to ourselves. Because we have to do with a God that changes not, therefore it is that we are not consumed; because his compassions fail not.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/malachi/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And who may abide the day of His coming? And who shall stand when He appeareth? - The implied answer is, "No one;" as in the Psalm Psa 130:3, "If Thou, Lord, wilt mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand?" Joel had asked the same , "The day of the Lord is great and very terrible; and who can abide it?"  "How can the weakness of man endure such might; his blindness, such light; his frailty, such power; his uncleanness, such holiness; the chaff, such a fire? For He is like a refine's fire. Who would not fail through stupefaction, fear, horror, shrinking reverence, from such majesty?"<p>Malachi seems to blend, as Joel, the first and second coming of our Lord. The first coming too was a time of sifting and severance, according as those, to whom He came, did or did not receive Him. The severance was not final, because there was yet space for repentance; but it was real, an earnest of the final judgment. <a href="//biblehub.com/john/9-39.htm">John 9:39</a>, "for judgment," our Lord says, "I am come into this world, that they which see not may see, and they which see might be made blind;" and again <a href="//biblehub.com/john/12-31.htm">John 12:31</a>, "Now is the judgment of this world;" and <a href="//biblehub.com/john/3-18.htm">John 3:18</a>, "He that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed on the name of the Only-Begotten Son of God; <a href="/john/3-36.htm">John 3:36</a>. He that believeth not the Son, shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him." As, on the other hand, He saith <a href="/john/6-54.htm">John 6:54</a>. "whoso eateth My Flesh and drinketh My Blood hath eternal life;" and <a href="//biblehub.com/john/6-47.htm">John 6:47</a>, "he that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life;" "hath," He saith; not, "shall have;" "hath it," in present reality and earnest, though he may forfeit it: so the other class is "condemned already," although the one may repent and be saved, the other may <a href="/ezekiel/33-18.htm">Ezekiel 33:18</a>. "turn from his righteousness and commit iniquity;" and if he persevere in it, "shall die therein."<p>It is then one ever-present judgment. Every soul of man is in a state of grace or out of it; in God's favor or under His wrath; and the judgment of the Great Day, in which the secrets of men's hearts shall be revealed, will be but an outward manifestation of that now hidden judgment. But the words, in their fullest sense, imply a passing of that judgment, in which men do or do not stand, as in those of our Lord <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/21-35.htm">Luke 21:35-36</a>. "As a snare shall that day come on all those that dwell on the face of the whole earth. Watch ye, therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things which shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of Man;" and Paul <a href="/ephesians/6-13.htm">Ephesians 6:13</a>. "Take unto you the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and, having done all, to stand;" and in the Revelation Rev 6:16-17. "They said to the mountains and rocks; Fall on us, and hide us from the wrath of Him that sitteth upon the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb. For the great day of His wrath is come, and who shall be able to stand?" Asaph says of a temporal, yet for this life, final destruction; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/76-6.htm">Psalm 76:6-7</a>, "At Thy rebuke, O God of, Jacob, both the chariot and horse are cast into a deep sleep. Thou art to be feared, and who may stand in Thy sight, when Thou art angry?"<p>For He is like a refiner's fire, and like fuller's soup - Two sorts of materials for cleansing are mentioned, the one severe, where the baser materials are inworked with the rich ore; the other mild, where the defilement is easily separable.  "He shall come like a refining fire; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/50-3.htm">Psalm 50:3-4</a>, 'a fire shall burn before Him, and it shall be very tempestuous round about Him. Then He shall call the heaven from above, and the earth, that He may judge HIs people;' streams of fire shall sweep before, bearing away all sinners. For the Lord is called a fire, and a <a href="/deuteronomy/4-24.htm">Deuteronomy 4:24</a>. consuming fire, so as to burn our <a href="/1_corinthians/3-12.htm">1 Corinthians 3:12</a>. wood, hay, stubble. And not fire only, but fuller's soap.  To those who sin heavily, He is a refining and consuming fire, but to those who commit light sins, fuller's soap, to restore cleanness to it, when washed."<p>Yet, though light in comparison, this too had its severity, for clothes which were washed (of which the word is used) were trampled  on by the feet.  "The nitrum and the fuller's soap is penitence." Yet the whiteness and purity so restored, is, at the last, perfected. Inspiration could find no more adequate comparison for us, for the brightness of our Lord's raiment from the glory of the Transfiguration, than <a href="//biblehub.com/mark/9-3.htm">Mark 9:3</a>, "exceeding white as snow; so as no fuller on earth can white them."<p>Our Lord is, in many ways, as a fire. He says of Himself; <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/12-49.htm">Luke 12:49</a>, "I am come to send a fire upon earth, and what will I, if it be already kindled?" John Baptist said of Him <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/3-16.htm">Luke 3:16</a>, "He shall baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire." He kindles in the heart "a fire of love," which softens what is hard, the will.<p>"Wash whate'er of stain is here,<p>Sprinkle what is dry or sere,<p>Heal and bind the wounded sprite;<p>Bend whate'er is stubborn still,<p>Kindle what is cold and chill,<p>What hath wandered guide aright."<p>But as God is "a consuming fire," Who must burn out the dross, unless we be <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-29.htm">Jeremiah 6:29-30</a> "reprobate silver" which "the founder melteth in vain," either He must, by His grace, consume the sin within us, or must consume us with it, in hell. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/malachi/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. (Mal 4:1; Re 6:16, 17). The Messiah would come, not, as they expected, to flatter the theocratic nation's prejudices, but to subject their principles to the fiery test of His heart-searching truth (Mt 3:10-12), and to destroy Jerusalem and the theocracy after they had rejected Him. His mission is here regarded as a whole from the first to the second advent: the process of refining and separating the godly from the ungodly beginning during Christ's stay on earth, going on ever since, and about to continue till the final separation (Mt 25:31-46). The refining process, whereby a third of the Jews is refined as silver of its dross, while two-thirds perish, is described, Zec 13:8, 9 (compare Isa 1:25).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/malachi/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">But</span>, <span class="ital">Heb.

When he should be manifest in Israel, and come preaching the Gospel of the kingdom; who could bear the doctrines delivered by him, concerning his deity and equality with God the Father; concerning his character and mission as the Messiah, and his kingdom not being a temporal, but a spiritual one; concerning his giving his flesh for the life of the world, and eating that by faith; concerning distinguishing and efficacious grace; and all such that so severely struck at the wickedness of the Scribes and Pharisees, and their self-righteous principles; and especially since for judgment he came, that they might not see? nor could they bear the light of this glorious Sun of righteousness; and he came not to send peace and outward prosperity to the Jews, but a sword and division, <a href="/john/9-39.htm">John 9:39</a> very few indeed could bear his ministry, or the light of that day, it being so directly contrary to their principles and practices: <p>and who shall stand when he appeareth? in his kingdom and glory, to take vengeance on the Jews for their rejection of him and his Gospel; for this coming and appearance of his include all the time between his manifestation in the flesh and the destruction of Jerusalem; and so all those sorrows and distresses which went before it, or attended it, and were such as had never been from the creation of the world; and unless those times had been shortened, no flesh could have been saved; see <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/24-3.htm">Matthew 24:3</a>, <p>for he is like a refiner's fire; partly by the ministry of the word, compared to fire, <a href="/jeremiah/23-29.htm">Jeremiah 23:29</a> separating pure doctrines from ones of dross; and partly by his fiery dispensations and judgments on the wicked Jews, when he distinguished and saved his own people from that untoward generation, and destroyed them: <p>and like fuller's soap; or "fuller's herb", as the Septuagint and Vulgate Latin versions render it, and Jarchi interprets it: and so R. Jonah (s) interprets it of an herb which fullers use: and in the Misna (t) this is one of the seven things used to take out spots, namely, "borith", the word here used; and which Maimonides (u) says is a plant known by the name of "algasul" and "gazul" in the Arabic language: it signifies something by which filth is washed away; and so Bartenora (w) says it is a plant which purifies and cleanses; and Jerom (x) relates that this herb grows in Palestine, in moist and green places, and has the same virtue as nitre to take away filth; agreeably to which some other versions render it "fuller's weed", or "soap weed" (y). The Syriac version is, <p>"as sulphur that makes white;'' <p>and fullers, with the Romans, were wont to make use of that along with chalk to take out spots; and so Pliny (z) speaks of a kind of sulphur which fullers make use of. A metaphor signifying the same thing as before, the removing of spotted doctrines or spotted persons, the one by the preaching of the Gospel, the other by awful judgments, as spots in garments are removed by the fuller's herb or soap. <p>(s) Apud Kimchi in Sepher Shorash. rad.

Such plants are met with on the shores of the Mediterranean and Dead Seas, and at this day large quantities of alkalies are extracted from them and exported in different directions (see Tristram, 'Nat. Hist. of the Bible,' p. 480, etc.; comp. <a href="/isaiah/4-4.htm">Isaiah 4:4</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/2-22.htm">Jeremiah 2:22</a>). The Lord shall wash away all that is filthy (comp. <a href="/matthew/3-10.htm">Matthew 3:10, 12</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/zechariah/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div><a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/7-1.htm">Zechariah 7:1-3</a> describe the occasion for this instructive and consolatory "word of God," which was addressed to Zechariah in the fourth year of Darius, i.e., two years after the building of the temple was resumed, and two years before its completion, and therefore at a time when the building must have been far advanced, and the temple itself was possibly already finished in the rough. <a href="/zechariah/7-1.htm">Zechariah 7:1</a>. "It came to pass in the fourth year of king Darius, that the word of Jehovah came to Zechariah, on the fourth (day) of the ninth month, in Kislev." In this definition of the time we are surprised first of all at the circumstance, that, according to the Masoretic accentuation, and the division of the verses, the statement of the time is torn into two halves, and the notice of the year is placed after &#1493;&#1497;&#1492;&#1497;, whilst that of the month does not follow till after &#1492;&#1514;&#1492; &#1491;&#1489;&#1512; &#1497;&#1497;; and secondly, at the fact that the introduction of the occurrence which led to this word of God is appended with the imperfect c. Vav rel. (vayyishlach), which would then stand in the sense of the pluperfect in opposition to the rule. On these grounds we must give up the Masoretic division of the verses, and connect the notice of the month and day in <a href="/zechariah/7-1.htm">Zechariah 7:1</a> with <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/7-2.htm">Zechariah 7:2</a>, so that <a href="/zechariah/7-1.htm">Zechariah 7:1</a> contains merely the general statement that in the fourth year of king Darius the word of the Lord came to Zechariah. What follows will then be appended thus: On the fourth day of the ninth month, in Kislev, Bethel sent, etc. Thus the more precise definition of the time is only given in connection with the following occurrence, because it was self-evident that the word of God which was addressed to the prophet in consequence of that event, could not have been addressed to him before it occurred. The rendering of the words in <a href="/zechariah/7-2.htm">Zechariah 7:2</a> is also a disputed point. We adopt the following: <a href="/zechariah/7-2.htm">Zechariah 7:2</a>. "Then Bethel sent Sharezer and Regem-melech, and his people, to entreat the face of Jehovah, (<a href="/zechariah/7-3.htm">Zechariah 7:3</a>) to speak to the priests who were at the house of Jehovah of hosts, and to the prophets, thus: Shall I weep, abstaining in the fifth month as I have now done so many years?" As Be&#772;th-e&#772;l may either signify the house of God, or be the name of the town of Bethel, it may be taken either as accus. loci, or as the subject of the sentence. Against the first explanation, which is very widely spread, viz., "it sent to the house of God, or to Bethel, Sharezer," etc., or "they sent to the house of God Sharezer," etc., it may be argued not only that the prophet, in order to make himself intelligible, ought either to have written 'el Be&#772;th-'e&#772;l, or to have placed Be&#772;th-'e&#772;l after the object, but also that beeth-'eel cannot be shown to have been ever applied to the temple of Jehovah, and that it would have been altogether out of place to speak of sending to Bethel, because Jehovah could not be prayed to in Bethel after the captivity. We must therefore take be&#772;th-'e&#772;l as the subject, and understand it as denoting the population of Bethel, and not as a name given to the church of the Lord, since there are no conclusive passages to support any such use, as be&#772;th Yeho&#772;va&#770;h only is used for the church of God (see at <a href="/hosea/8-1.htm">Hosea 8:1</a>), and here there could be no inducement to employ so unusual an epithet to denote the nation. A considerable number of the earlier inhabitants of Bethel had already returned with Zerubbabel, according to <a href="/ezra/2-28.htm">Ezra 2:28</a> and <a href="/nehemiah/7-32.htm">Nehemiah 7:32</a>; and, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-31.htm">Nehemiah 11:31</a>, the little town appears to have been soon rebuilt. The inhabitants of this city sent an embassy to Jerusalem, namely Sharezer and Rechem-Melech, and his men. The omission of the nota accus. &#1488;&#1514; has indeed been adduced as an objection to this interpretation of the names as the object, and the names have been therefore taken as the subject, and regarded as in apposition to Be&#772;th-e&#772;l: "Bethel, namely Sharezer and Rechem, etc., sent;" that is to say, two men are mentioned in connection with Bethel, who are supposed to have acted as leaders of the embassy. But there is something so harsh and inflexible in the assumption of such an apposition as this, that in spite of the omission of the &#1488;&#1514; we prefer to regard the names as accusatives. The name Sharezer is evidently Assyrian (cf. <a href="/isaiah/37-38.htm">Isaiah 37:38</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-3.htm">Jeremiah 39:3</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/39-13.htm">Jeremiah 39:13</a>), so that the man was probably born in Babylonia.<p>The object of sending these men is given first of all in general terms: viz., &#1500;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1497;&#1497;, lit., to stroke the face of Jehovah, - an anthropomorphic expression for affectionate entreaty (see at <a href="/psalms/119-58.htm">Psalm 119:58</a>), and then defined more precisely in <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/7-3.htm">Zechariah 7:3</a>, where it is stated that they were to inquire of the priests and prophets, i.e., through their mediation, to entreat an answer from the Lord, whether the mourning and fasting were to be still kept up in the fifth month. Through the clause &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1500;&#1489;&#1497;&#1514; &#1497;&#1497; the priests are described as belonging to the house of Jehovah, though not in the sense supposed by Kliefoth, namely, "because they were appointed to serve in His house along with the Levites, in the place of the first-born, who were the possession of Jehovah" (<a href="/numbers/3-41.htm">Numbers 3:41</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-8.htm">Deuteronomy 10:8-9</a>). There is no such allusion here; but the meaning is simply, "as the persons in the temple, who by virtue of their mediatorial service were able to obtain an answer from Jehovah to a question addressed to Him in prayer." The connection with the prophets points to this. The question &#1492;&#1488;&#1489;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492; is defined by the inf. absol. &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1494;&#1512;, as consisting in weeping or lamentation connected with abstinence from food and drink, i.e., with fasting. On this use of the inf. abs., see Ewald, 280, a; &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1494;&#1512;, to abstain (in this connection from meat and drink), is synonymous with &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; in <a href="/zechariah/7-5.htm">Zechariah 7:5</a>. &#1494;&#1492; &#1499;&#1468; &#1502;&#1468;&#1492; &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;: "these how many years," for which we should say, "so many years." Kammeh suggests the idea of an incalculably long duration. &#1494;&#1492;, in this and other similar combinations with numerical data, has acquired the force of an adverb: now, already (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/1-12.htm">Zechariah 1:12</a>, and Ewald, 302, b). The subject to &#1488;&#1489;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492; is the population of Bethel, by which the men had been delegated. The question, however, had reference to a subject in which the whole community was interested, and hence the answer from God is addressed to all the people (<a href="/zechariah/7-5.htm">Zechariah 7:5</a>). So far as the circumstances themselves are concerned, we can see from <a href="/zechariah/7-5.htm">Zechariah 7:5</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/8-19.htm">Zechariah 8:19</a>, that during the captivity the Israelites had adopted the custom of commemorating the leading incidents in the Chaldaean catastrophe by keeping fast-days in the fifth, seventh, fourth, and tenth months. In the fifth month (Ab), on the tent day, because, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-12.htm">Jeremiah 52:12-13</a>, that was the day on which the temple and the city of Jerusalem were destroyed by fire in the nineteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar, though the seventh day of that month is the date given in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/25-8.htm">2 Kings 25:8-9</a> (see the comm. in loc.). In the seventh month, according to Jewish tradition, they fasted on the third day, on account of the murder of the governor Gedaliah, and the Judaeans who had been left in the land (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/25-25.htm">2 Kings 25:25-26</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/51-1.htm">Jeremiah 51:1</a>.). In the fourth month Tammuz) they fasted on the ninth day, on account of the conquest of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar in the eleventh year of Zedekiah (<a href="/jeremiah/39-2.htm">Jeremiah 39:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-6.htm">Jeremiah 52:6-7</a>). And lastly, in the tenth month, a fast was kept on the tenth day on account of the commencement of the siege of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar on that day, in the ninth year of Zedekiah (<a href="/2_kings/25-1.htm">2 Kings 25:1</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/39-1.htm">Jeremiah 39:1</a>).<p>(Note: The later Jews kept the 9th Ab as the day when both the first and second temples were destroyed by fire; and in Mishna Taanit iv. 6, five disasters are enumerated, which had fallen upon Israel on that day: viz., (1) the determination of God not to suffer the fathers to enter the promised land; (2 and 3) the destruction of the first and second temples; (4) the conquest of the city of Bether in the time of Bar-Cochba; (5) the destruction of the holy city, which Rashi explains from <a href="/micah/3-12.htm">Micah 3:12</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-18.htm">Jeremiah 26:18</a>, but which others refer to the fact that Turnus Rufus (either Turannius Rufus or T. Annius Rufus: cf. Schttgen, Horae hebr. et talm. ii. 953ff., and Jost, Gesch. des Judenthums, ii. 77) ploughed over the foundation of the temple. Also, on the seventeenth of the fourth month (Tammuz), according to Mishna Taan. iv. 6, five disasters are said to have befallen Israel: (1) the breaking of the tables of the law (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/32.htm">Exodus 32</a>); (2) the cessation of the daily sacrifice in the first temple from the want of sacrificial lambs (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/52-6.htm">Jeremiah 52:6</a>); (3) the breach made in the city walls; (4) the burning of the law by Apostemus; and (5) the setting up of the abomination, i.e., of an idol, in the temple (<a href="/daniel/11-31.htm">Daniel 11:31</a>; <a href="/daniel/12-13.htm">Daniel 12:13</a>). Vid., Lundius, Codex talm. de jejunio, Traf. ad Rhen. 1694, p. 55ff.; also in abstract in Mishna ed. Surenhus. ii. pp. 382-3.)<p>The question put by the delegates referred simply to the fasting in the fifth month, in commemoration of the destruction of the temple. And now that the rebuilding of the temple was rapidly approaching completion, it appeared no longer in character to continue to keep this day, especially as the prophets had proclaimed on the part of God, that the restoration of the temple would be a sign that Jehovah had once more restored His favour to the remnant of His people. If this fast-day were given up, the others would probably be also relinquished. The question actually involved the prayer that the Lord would continue permanently to bestow upon His people the favour which He had restored to them, and not only bring to completion the restoration of the holy place, which was already begun, but accomplish generally the glorification of Israel predicted by the earlier prophets. The answer given by the Lord through Zechariah to the people refers to this, since the priests and prophets could give no information in the matter of their own accord.<p>The answer from the Lord divides itself into two parts, <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/7-4.htm">Zechariah 7:4-14</a> and ch. 8. In the first part He explains what it is that He requires of the people, and why He has been obliged to punish them with exile: in the second He promises them the restoration of His favour and the promised salvation. Each of these parts is divisible again into two sections, <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/7-4.htm">Zechariah 7:4-7</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/7-8.htm">Zechariah 7:8-14</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/8-1.htm">Zechariah 8:1-17</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/8-18.htm">Zechariah 8:18-23</a>; and each of these sections opens with the formula, "The word of Jehovah (of hosts) came to me (Zechariah), saying." </body></html>
