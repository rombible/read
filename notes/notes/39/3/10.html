God gives them a gracious call. But they said, Wherein shall we return? God notices what returns our hearts make to the calls of his word. It shows great perverseness in sin, when men make afflictions excuses for sin, which are sent to part between them and their sins. Here is an earnest exhortation to reform. God must be served in the first place; and the interest of our souls ought to be preferred before that of our bodies. Let them trust God to provide for their comfort. God has blessings ready for us, but through the weakness of our faith and the narrowness of our desires, we have not room to receive them. He who makes trial will find nothing is lost by honouring the Lord with his substance.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/malachi/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Bring the whole tithes - , not a part only, keeping back more or less, and, as he had said, defrauding God, offering, like Ananias, apart, as if it had been the whole; into the treasury, where they were collected in the time of Hezekiah  and again, at this time, by the direction of Nehemiah, "so that there shall be food,"  not superfluity, in My house  "for those who minister in the house of My sanctuary." <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-10.htm">Nehemiah 13:10-23</a>. "The Levites and singers had, before the reformation, fled every one to his field, because the portion of the Levites had not been given them." On Nehemiah's remonstrance, aided by Malachi, "the tithe of corn and the wine and the new oil were brought into the treasuries."<p>Bring the whole tithes - o "Thou knowest that all things which come to thee are God's, and dost not thou give of His own to the Creator of all? The Lord God needeth not: He asketh not a reward, but reverence: He asketh not anything of thine, to restore to Him. He asketh of thee "first-fruits and tithes." Niggard, what wouldest thou do, if He took nine parts to Himself, and left thee the tenth? What if He said to thee; 'Man, thou art Mine, Who made thee; Mine is the land which thou tillest; Mine are the seeds, which thou sowest; Mine are the animals, which thou weariest; Mine are the showers, Mine the winds, Mine the sun's heat; and since Mine are all the elements, whereby thou livest, thou who givest only the labor of thine hands, deservest only the tithes.' But since Almighty God lovingly feeds us, He gives most ample reward to us who labor little: claiming to Himself the tithes only, He has condoned us all the rest."<p>And prove Me now herewith, in or by this thing - God pledges Himself to His creatures, in a way in which they themselves can verify. "If you will obey, I will supply all your needs; if not, I will continue your dearth." By whatever laws God orders the material creation, He gave them a test, of the completion of which they themselves could judge, of which they themselves must have judged. They had been afflicted with years of want. God promises them years of plenty, on a condition which He names. What would men think now, if anyone had, in God's name, promised that such or such a disease, which injured our crops or our cattle, should come at once to an end, if any one of God's laws should be kept? We should have been held as finatics, and rightly, for we had no commission of God. God authenticates those by whom He speaks; He promises, who alone can perform.<p> "There are three keys which God hath reserved in His own hands, and hath not delivered to any to minister or substitute, the keys of life, of rain, and of the resurrection. In the ordering of the rain they look on His great power, no less than in giving life at first, or afterward raising the dead to it; as Paul saith <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/14-17.htm">Acts 14:17</a>, "God left not Himself without witness, in that He did good and gave rain, from heaven and fruitful seasons."<p>If I will not open the windows of heaven - o In the time of the flood, they were, as it were, opened, to man's destruction: now, God would rain abundantly for you, for their sakes. "And pour you out, literally empty out to you," give to them fully, holding back nothing. So in the Gospel it is said, that the love of God is "shed abroad  poured out and forth in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which is given to us."<p>"That there is not room enough to receive it; literally until there is no sufficiency." (In <a href="/psalms/72-7.htm">Psalm 72:7</a> (quoted by Ges. Ros. etc.) "there shall be abundance of peace &#1497;&#1512;&#1495; &#1489;&#1500;&#1497; &#1506;&#1491;, literally, "until there be no moon," has a literal meaning, that the peace should last until the end of our creation, without saying anything of what lies beyond.) The text does not express what should not suffice, whether it be on God's part or on man's. Yet it were too great irony, if understood of God. His superabundance, "above all which we can ask or think," is a first principle in the conception of God, as the Infinite Source of all being. But to say of God. that He would pour out His blessing, until man could not contain it, is one bliss of eternity, that God's gifts will overflow the capacity of His creatures to receive them. The pot of oil poured forth the oil, until, on the prophets saying <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/4-6.htm">2 Kings 4:6</a>, "Bring me yet a vessel," the widows son said, There is not a vessel more. And the oil stayed." God's gifts are limited only by our capacity to receive them. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/malachi/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10.

Or, even so as that there should be "not merely" "sufficiency" but superabundance [Jerome, Maurer]. Gesenius not so well translates, "Even to a failure of sufficiency," which in the case of God could never arise, and therefore means for ever, perpetually: so Ps 72:5, "as long as the sun and moon endure"; literally, "until a failure of the sun and moon," which is never to be; and therefore means, for ever.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/malachi/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Bring ye</span>: if these persons spoken of be the priests, then they are required not to detain the tithes in their own hands, but, as was their duty, to bring them into the public storehouse.

There were the tithe or tenth part of all eatable things paid to the Levites, and out of this another tithe was paid by the Levites to the priests; and there was another tithe, which some years the owners ate themselves at Jerusalem, and in others gave them to the poor; and these were called the first tithe, the tithe out of the tithe, the second tithe, and the poor's tithe; though they are commonly reduced to three, and are called first, and second, and third, as they are by Maimonides; who says (f), <p>"after they have separated the first tithe every year, they separate the second tithe, as it is said "thou shalt truly tithe all the increase of thy seed", &amp;c. <a href="/deuteronomy/14-22.htm">Deuteronomy 14:22</a> and in the third year, and in the sixth, they separate the poor's tithe, instead of the second tithe.'' <p>So Tobit says; Tobit 1:7 <p>"the first tithe I gave to the Levites, who stand before the Lord to minister to him, and to bless in his name the inhabitants of Jerusalem; the second tithe I sold (as he might, according to the law in <a href="/deuteronomy/14-24.htm">Deuteronomy 14:24</a>), and took the money, and went up to Jerusalem, and bought with it what I pleased; and the third tithe I gave to the repair of the temple;'' <p>so Fagius reads: but according to Munster's edition it is, the second and third tithes I gave to the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow; see <a href="/deuteronomy/26-12.htm">Deuteronomy 26:12</a>. It appears from hence that the sin of the people was, that they did not bring in "all" their tithes; they kept back a part of them: wherefore they are called upon to bring in the whole, and which they did in Nehemiah's time; see <a href="/nehemiah/10-38.htm">Nehemiah 10:38</a> where mention is made of the treasuries for the tithe, which were certain chambers adjoining to the temple; and besides those that were built by Solomon, there were other chambers prepared by Hezekiah in his times, when the tithes were brought in, in such plenty, that there was not room enough for them, <a href="/2_chronicles/31-11.htm">2 Chronicles 31:11</a> and besides those in the second temple, that were in the court of the priests, there were others in the court of the people, as L'Empereur thinks (g), where what the others could not contain might be put; and into which court the priests might come; and there were also receptacles underground, as well as upper rooms, where much might be laid up; add to all this, that Dr. Lightfoot (h) suggests, that these tithes were treasured up in the chambers by the gates of the temple, and were at least a part of the treasuries of the house of God, which the porters at the gates had the care of, <a href="/1_chronicles/9-26.htm">1 Chronicles 9:26</a> and particularly that the house of Asuppim, at which were four porters, was a large piece of building, containing divers rooms for the treasuring up things for the use of the temple; in the Apocrypha: <p>" And are resolved to spend the firstfruits of the the tenths of wine and oil, which they had sanctified, and reserved for the priests that serve in Jerusalem before the face of our God; the which things it is not lawful for any of the people so much as to touch with their hands.'' Judith 11:13 <p>that there may be food in mine house; in the temple, for the sustenance of the priests and Levites: so the Targum, <p>"the prophet said, bring all the tithes into the treasury, that there may be food for them that minister in the house of my sanctuary:'' <p>and prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts; by bringing in all their tithes; when they would find, by making this experiment or trial, that the curse would be removed from them, and blessings be largely and liberally bestowed upon them by him, who is the Lord of hosts, and so able to perform any promise he makes; and here one is implied, and is as follows: <p>if I will not open you the windows of heaven; which had been shut and stopped up, and let down no rain upon their land, which brought a scarcity of provisions among them; but now, upon a change in their conduct it is suggested that these windows or floodgates should be opened, and rain let down plentifully upon them, which only could be done by the Lord himself; for the key of rain is one of the three keys, the Jews say (i), which God has reserved for himself, and never puts into the hands of a minister: <p>and pour you out a blessing: give abundance of rain to make the earth fruitful, and bring forth its increase in great plenty, which is a blessing; and not destroy the earth, and the fruits of it, as in the times of Noah, when the windows of heaven were opened, and a curse was poured out upon the earth: <p>that there shall not be room enough to receive it; and so Kimchi says his father interpreted this clause, that there would not be a sufficiency of vessels (k) and storehouses. Some render the words, as Junius, "so that ye shall not be sufficient"; either to gather in the increase, or to consume it. The Targum is, <p>"until ye say it is enough;'' <p>and so the Syriac version. The phrase, which is very concise in the original text, and may be literally rendered, "unto not enough" (l), denotes great abundance and fulness of good things, so that there should be enough and to spare; and yet, as Gussetius observes, not enough to answer and express the abundance of mercy and goodness in the heart of God. <p>continued...<a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/malachi/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the LORD of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, <span class="cverse3">{k}</span> that <i>there shall</i> not <i>be room</i> enough <i>to receive it</i>.</span><p>(k) Not having respect how much you need, but I will give you in all abundance, so that you will lack place to put my blessings in.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/malachi/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">10</span>. <span class="ital">all the tithes</span>] More exactly, <span class="bld">the whole tithe</span>, R.

The introduction of the prophet's name in the heading in <a href="/zechariah/7-8.htm">Zechariah 7:8</a> does not warrant the strange opinion held by Schmieder and Schlier - namely, that our prophet is here reproducing the words of an earlier Zechariah who lived before the captivity - but is merely to be attributed to a variation in the form of expression. This divine word was as follows: <a href="/zechariah/7-9.htm">Zechariah 7:9</a>. "Thus hath Jehovah of hosts spoken, saying, Execute judgment of truth, and show love and compassion one to another. <a href="/zechariah/7-10.htm">Zechariah 7:10</a>. And widows and orphans, strangers and destitute ones, oppress not; and meditate not in your heart the injury of every brother. <a href="/zechariah/7-11.htm">Zechariah 7:11</a>. But they refused to attend, and offered a rebellious shoulder, and hardened their ears that they might not hear. <a href="/zechariah/7-12.htm">Zechariah 7:12</a>. And they made their heart diamond, that they might not hear the law and the words which Jehovah of hosts sent through His Spirit by means of the former prophet, so that great wrath came from Jehovah of hosts." &#1499;&#1468;&#1492; &#1488;&#1502;&#1512; is to be taken as a preterite here, referring to what Jehovah had caused to be proclaimed to the people before the captivity. The kernel of this announcement consisted in the appeal to the people, to keep the moral precepts of the law, to practise the true love of the neighbour in public life and private intercourse. Mishpat 'e&#774;meth, judgment of truth (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/18-8.htm">Ezekiel 18:8</a>), is such an administration of justice as simply fixes the eye upon the real circumstances of any dispute, without any personal considerations whatever, and decides them in accordance with truth. For the fact itself, compare <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/22-20.htm">Exodus 22:20</a>, <a href="/exodus/22-21.htm">Exodus 22:21</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/23-6.htm">Exodus 23:6-9</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/19-15.htm">Leviticus 19:15-18</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-18.htm">Deuteronomy 10:18-19</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/24-14.htm">Deuteronomy 24:14</a>; <a href="/isaiah/1-17.htm">Isaiah 1:17</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-5.htm">Jeremiah 7:5-6</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/22-3.htm">Jeremiah 22:3</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/18-8.htm">Ezekiel 18:8</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/12-7.htm">Hosea 12:7</a>, etc. &#1512;&#1506;&#1514; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1488;&#1495;&#1497;&#1493;, the injury of a man who is his brother (as in <a href="/genesis/9-5.htm">Genesis 9:5</a>); not "injury one towards another," which would suppose a transposition of the &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;  equals  &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1512;&#1506;&#1514; &#1488;&#1495;&#1497;&#1493;. In <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/7-11.htm">Zechariah 7:11</a>, <a href="/zechariah/7-12.htm">Zechariah 7:12</a> the attitude of the people towards these admonitions of God is described. Na&#770;than ka&#770;the&#772;ph so&#772;rereth: to give or offer a rebellious shoulder, as in <a href="/nehemiah/9-29.htm">Nehemiah 9:29</a>. The figure is borrowed from an ox, which will not allow a yoke to be placed upon its neck (cf. <a href="/hosea/4-16.htm">Hosea 4:16</a>). To make the ears heavy (hikhb&#305;&#772;d), away from hearing, i.e., so that they do not hear (cf. <a href="/isaiah/6-10.htm">Isaiah 6:10</a>). To make the heart diamond (sha&#770;m&#305;&#772;r), i.e., as hard as diamond. A stony heart is a heart not susceptible to impressions (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/11-19.htm">Ezekiel 11:19</a>). The relative &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; before sha&#770;lach refers to the two nouns named before, viz., to&#772;ra&#770;h and debha&#770;r&#305;&#772;m, though we need not on that account take to&#772;ra&#770;h in the general sense of instruction. God also sent the law to the people through the prophets, i.e., caused them to preach it and impress it upon their hearts. The consequence of this obduracy of the people was, that "there arose great wrath from Jehovah" (cf. <a href="/zechariah/1-2.htm">Zechariah 1:2</a>; <a href="/2_kings/3-27.htm">2 Kings 3:27</a>). </body></html>
