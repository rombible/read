They spake what was right concerning God’s justice and mercy, his holiness, forbearance, and long-suffering, his wisdom and equity in his government of the world in general, and of his church and the members of it in particular. And by their pious discourse they endeavoured to arm each other against the impressions which such wicked suggestions as those above mentioned might otherwise have made upon their minds; and to confirm one another in piety and virtue. <span class="ital">And the Lord hearkened and heard — </span>Took a special notice of what these pious persons did and said. <span class="ital">And a book of remembrance was written — </span>It was as safely laid up in his memory as if it had been entered into a register, in order to be produced at the day of judgment to their praise and honour: see the margin.

The period especially referred to may be the Roman war under Titus. When God should utterly cut off the Jewish Church and nation for their infidelity, the remnant among them, that should be found to believe his word, and having waited for the Messiah, the consolation of Israel, should welcome him when he came; these, being admitted into the Christian Church, should become a peculiar people to God, and God would take care of them, that they should not perish with the unbelievers, but that they should be hid in the day of the Lord’s anger against that nation. These pious ones should have all the glorious privileges of God’s Israel appropriated to them, and centring in them. They should be a peculiar treasure unto him, when the rest were rejected; should be vessels of mercy and honour when the rest should be made vessels of wrath and dishonour. This, however, is very applicable to all the faithful people of God, and the distinction he will put between them and others, in the great day of final accounts.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/malachi/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:13-18 Among the Jews at this time, some plainly discovered themselves to be children of the wicked one. The yoke of Christ is easy. But those who work wickedness, tempt God by presumptuous sins. Judge of things as they will appear when the doom of these proud sinners comes to be executed. Those that feared the Lord, spake kindly, for preserving and promoting mutual love, when sin thus abounded. They spake one to another, in the language of those that fear the Lord, and think on his name. As evil communications corrupt good minds and manners, so good communications confirm them. A book of remembrance was written before God. He will take care that his children perish not with those that believe not. They shall be vessels of mercy and honour, when the rest are made vessels of wrath and dishonour. The saints are God's jewels; they are dear to him. He will preserve them as his jewels, when the earth is burned up like dross. Those who now own God for theirs, he will then own for his. It is our duty to serve God with the disposition of children; and he will not have his children trained up in idleness; they must do him service from a principle of love. Even God's children stand in need of sparing mercy. All are righteous or wicked, such as serve God, or such as serve him not: all are going to heaven or to hell. We are often deceived in our opinions concerning both the one and the other; but at the bar of Christ, every man's character will be known. As to ourselves, we have need to think among which we shall have our lot; and, as to others, we must judge nothing before the time. But in the end all the world will confess that those alone were wise and happy, who served the Lord and trusted in Him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/malachi/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Then they that feared the Lord spake often among themselves - The proud-speaking of the ungodly called out the piety of the God-fearing.  "The more the ungodly spake against God, the more these spake among themselves for God." Both went on until the Great Day of severance. True, as those said, the distinction between righteous and wicked was not made yet, but it was stored up out of sight. They "spake among themselves," strengthening each other against the ungodly sayings of the ungodly.<p>And the Lord hearkened and heard it - God, whom these thought an idle looker-on, or regardless, all the while (to speak after the manner of men) was "bending the ear"  from heaven "and heard." Not one pious loyal word for Him and His glory, escaped Him.<p>And a book of remembrance was written before Him - Kings had their chronicles written  wherein people's good or ill deeds toward them were recorded. But the image is one of the oldest in Scripture, and in the self-same words , "the Lord said to Moses, Write this, a memorial in a book." God can only speak to us in our own language. One expression is not more human than another, since all are so. Since with God all things are present, and memory relates to the past, to speak of God as "remembering" is as imperfect an expression in regard to God, as to speak of "a book." , "Forgetfulness hath no place with God, because He is in no way changed; nor remembrance, because He forgetteth not." Both expressions are used, only to picture vividly to our minds, that our deeds are present with God, for good or for evil; and in the Day of Judgment He will make them manifest to men and angels, as though read out of a book, and will requite them. So Daniel had said <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/7-10.htm">Daniel 7:10</a>, "the judgment was set, and the books were opened." And John says <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/20-12.htm">Revelation 20:12</a>, "The books were opened, and another book was opened, which is the book of life; and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works." So Moses says to God, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/32-32.htm">Exodus 32:32</a>, "If not, blot me out of Thy book which Thou hast written;" and David, prophesying, prays <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/69-28.htm">Psalm 69:28</a>, "Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be written among the righteous;" and our Lord bids His discipies <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/10-20.htm">Luke 10:20</a>, "Rejoice in this, that your names are written in heaven."<p>And that thought upon His name - Rather, "esteemed, prized," it, in contrast with those who <a href="/malachi/1-6.htm">Malachi 1:6</a>. "despised;" as, of Christ, when He should come, it is said <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>, "He was despised, and we esteemed Him not."  "The thinking on His Name imports, not a bare thinking of, but a due esteem and awful regard of, so as with all care to avoid all things which may tend to the dishonor of it, as always in His presence and with respect to Him and fear of Him."  "Those are meant who always meditate on the ways of the Lord and the knowledge of His Godhead, for His name is Himself, and He is His Name;"  "the wise in heart who know the mystery of the awful glorious Name." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/malachi/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16. "Then," when the ungodly utter such blasphemies against God, the godly hold mutual converse, defending God's righteous dealings against those blasphemers (Heb 3:13). The "often" of English Version is not in the Hebrew. There has been always in the darkest times a remnant that feared God (1Ki 19:18; Ro 11:4).<p>feared the Lord&#8212;reverential and loving fear, not slavish terror. When the fire of religion burns low, true believers should draw the nearer together, to keep the holy flame alive. Coals separated soon go out.<p>book of remembrance &#8230; for them&#8212;for their advantage, against the day when those found faithful among the faithless shall receive their final reward. The kings of Persia kept a record of those who had rendered services to the king, that they might be suitably rewarded (Es 6:1, 2; compare Es 2:23; Ezr 4:15; Ps 56:8; Isa 65:6; Da 7:10; Re 20:12). Calvin makes the fearers of God to be those awakened from among the ungodly mass (before described) to true repentance; the writing of the book thus will imply that some were reclaimable among the blasphemers, and that the godly should be assured that, though no hope appeared, there would be a door of penitence opened for them before God. But there is nothing in the context to support this view.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/malachi/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Then; </span> when atheism and bold contempt of God was grown so high, and was so plainly and smartly reproved by the prophet. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">They that feared the Lord; </span> those that were truly religious, that knew God’s judgments were a great deep, and that his ways were as high above our ways as heaven above the earth. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Spake often one to another; </span> discoursed aright of God’s mercy, justice, patience, holiness, and wisdom in his government and manage of the sells of men; established one another against the assaults of such proud, contemptuous disputers; encouraged each other to wait for God in the way of his judgments.

Abarbinel thinks this is a continuation of the speech of the wicked; observing, that while they that work wickedness were set up, and they that tempted God escaped punishment, they that were religious, and feared God, "were destroyed one with another", particularly by the plague; so he would have the word rendered, which we translate, "spake often one to another"; in which sense he observes that root is used in <a href="/hosea/13-14.htm">Hosea 13:14</a> but rather this is opposed unto what they said, by such, who, at the time referred to (which seems to be between the time of Christ's coming, spoken of in the beginning of the chapter <a href="//biblehub.com/malachi/3-1.htm">Malachi 3:1</a>, and the destruction of Jerusalem after mentioned), feared the Lord, and served him; embraced the Messiah, and professed his name; for the fear of God takes in the whole of religious worship, both internal and external; and describes such, not that have a dread of the majesty of God, and of his judgments and wrath, or distrust his power, providence, grace, and goodness; but who have a filial and holy fear of God, a fiducial and fearless one, a reverential affection for him, and are true and sincere worshippers of him: these "spake often one to another"; of the unbelief, impiety, and profaneness of men, with great concern and lamentation; and of the great and good things they were led into the knowledge of; the everlasting love of the Father in the choice of them, and covenant with them in Christ; of redemption by the Son; of the glories of his person, and the fulness of his grace; of the work of the Spirit of God upon their souls; and of the various truths of the everlasting Gospel; and of the gracious experiences they were indulged with; and all this they said for the glory of God's grace, and for the comforting and strengthening, and edifying, of each other's souls: it follows, <p>and the Lord hearkened, and heard it; what they said one to another: this is spoken after the manner of men, and does not so much regard the omniscience of God, who hearkens and hears everything that is said by wicked men, as by good men; as his special regard unto, peculiar notice he takes of, and the approbation he has of his people, and of their words and actions, and even of their thoughts, as is afterwards intimated: <p>and a book of remembrance was written before him; in allusion to kings that keep registers, records, annals, and chronicles, as memorials of matters of moment and importance: see <a href="/ezra/4-15.htm">Ezra 4:15</a> <a href="//biblehub.com/esther/2-23.htm">Esther 2:23</a>, otherwise there is no forgetfulness in God; he bears in his own eternal mind a remembrance of the persons, thoughts, words, and actions of his people, and which he will disclose and make mention of another day; even our Lord Jesus Christ, who is God over all, and who will let the churches and world know that he is the searcher of hearts, and trier of the reins of the children of men: <p>for them that feared the Lord, as before, <p>and that thought upon his name; either the name of the Father; not any particular name of his, by which he is known, but him himself; for, as Kimchi observes, his name is himself, and he himself is his name; and especially as he is in Christ, and proclaimed in him; and this is expressive of faith in him, love to him, and reverence of him: or the name of Christ; and not any particular name of his, unless it be Jesus the Saviour: but rather his person as the Son of God; his office as Mediator; and his blood, righteousness, and sacrifice: and it is not a bare thinking of him that is here intended, but such a thought of him as is accompanied with esteem and value for him, because of the dignity of his person, and the riches of his grace.

The names of such persons were placed on a special roll (Herod. VIII. 85), and great care was taken that they should be properly recompensed (see Herod. III. 140, v. II, VIII. 85; Thucyd. I. 138; Xen. <span class="ital">Hel.</span> 111. 1. § 6, &c.). It is a mistake, however, to suppose (Davidson) that they were always rewarded <span class="ital">at once</span>. Themistocles was inscribed on the list in b.c. 480, but did not obtain a reward till b.c. 465. Other ‘benefactors’ waited for months (Herod. <a href="/malachi/3-11.htm" title="And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field, said the LORD of hosts.">Malachi 3:11</a>) or perhaps years (<span class="ital">ib.</span> IX. 107) before they were recompensed.” The figure of a Book of record or remembrance, as kept or directed to be kept by Almighty God, is of early as well as of very general occurrence in Holy Scripture. Moreover there was a ‘Recorder’ in the court of the Hebrew kings. See <a href="/exodus/17-14.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: for I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.">Exodus 17:14</a>; <a href="/exodus/32-32.htm" title="Yet now, if you will forgive their sin--; and if not, blot me, I pray you, out of your book which you have written.">Exodus 32:32</a>; <a href="/psalms/69-28.htm" title="Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be written with the righteous.">Psalm 69:28</a>; <a href="/daniel/7-10.htm" title="A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand thousands ministered to him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened.">Daniel 7:10</a>; <a href="/luke/10-20.htm" title="Notwithstanding in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject to you; but rather rejoice, because your names are written in heaven.">Luke 10:20</a>; <a href="/revelation/20-12.htm" title="And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.">Revelation 20:12</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">thought upon</span>] Gesenius compares “which shall not <span class="ital">regard</span> silver”, <a href="/isaiah/13-17.htm" title="Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them, which shall not regard silver; and as for gold, they shall not delight in it.">Isaiah 13:17</a>; “he <span class="ital">regardeth</span> no man”, <a href="/isaiah/33-8.htm" title="The highways lie waste, the wayfaring man ceases: he has broken the covenant, he has despised the cities, he regards no man.">Isaiah 33:8</a>; “we <span class="ital">esteemed</span> him not”, <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm" title="He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not.">Isaiah 53:3</a>; in all which places the same Hebrew word is used.

When the impious made the above infidel remarks, the pious spake often, conversed together. What they said is not repeated, but it was language well pleasing unto God, who deigned to listen to their words, and to console them by announcing the future destiny of the good and the evil. They may have argued with these impious talkers, and warned others against them; or they may have expostulated as <a href="/jeremiah/12-1.htm">Jeremiah 12:1</a>, but yet with  full faith that what God does is always good; and this sentiment was all the harder to cherish because they lived under a system of temporal rewards and punishments. The Septuagint and Syriac have, "These things spake they that feared the Lord," as if the two preceding verses reported the words of the pious. Some Fathers and commentators have taken the same view. But it is difficult to conceive such words coming from the mouth of those who fear God; unless they are so called ironically. But this is inadmissible, as we see that in the present verse they are represented in their true character, and such a sudden change from irony to actuality is unnatural and quite opposed to the prophet's usual manner. <span class="cmt_word">A book of remembrance was written before him.</span> The hook represents God's providence and omniscience, his ever-wakeful care, his unfailing knowledge. "Are not these things noted in thy book?" says the psalmist (<a href="/psalms/56-8.htm">Psalm 56:8</a>); and when the dead were judged, Daniel saw that the books were opened (<a href="/daniel/7-10.htm">Daniel 7:10</a>). The idea is taken from the national records wherein were noted events of importance, such as we find in the cuneiform inscriptions (comp. <a href="/1_kings/11-41.htm">1 Kings 11:41</a>, etc.; <a href="/ezra/4-15.htm">Ezra 4:15</a>; <a href="/ezra/6-1.htm">Ezra 6:1</a>; <a href="/esther/6-1.htm">Esther 6:1</a>; <a href="/revelation/20-12.htm">Revelation 20:12</a>). This book was to lie, as it were, always before the eyes of the Lord, to remind him of the pious.

"And the word of Jehovah of hosts came, saying, <a href="/zechariah/8-2.htm">Zechariah 8:2</a>. Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, I am jealous for Zion with great jealousy, and with great fury I am jealous for her." The promise commences with the declaration of the Lord, that He has resolved to give active expression once more to the warmth of His love to Zion. The perfects are used prophetically of that which God had resolved to do, and was now about to accomplish. For the fact itself, compare <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/1-14.htm">Zechariah 1:14-15</a>. This warmth of the love of God towards Zion, and of His wrath towards the nations that were hostile to Zion, will manifest itself in the facts described in <a href="/zechariah/8-3.htm">Zechariah 8:3</a> : "Thus saith Jehovah, I return to Zion, and shall dwell in the midst of Jerusalem; and Jerusalem will be called city of truth, and the mountain of Jehovah of hosts the holy mountain." When Jerusalem was given up into the power of its foes, the Lord had forsaken His dwelling-place in the temple. Ezekiel saw the glory of the Lord depart from the temple (Ezeliel <a href="/ezekiel/9-3.htm">Ezekiel 9:3</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-4.htm">Ezekiel 10:4</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/10-18.htm">Ezekiel 10:18</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-22.htm">Ezekiel 11:22-23</a>). Now He is about to resume His abode in Jerusalem once more. The difference between this promise and the similar promise in <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/2-10.htm">Zechariah 2:10-13</a>, is not that in the latter passage Jehovah's dwelling in the midst of His people is to be understood in an ideal and absolute sense, whereas here it simply denotes such a dwelling as had taken place before, as Koehler supposes. This is not implied in &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, nor is it in harmony with the statement that Jerusalem is to be called a city of truth, and the temple hill the holy mountain. &#8219;Ir 'e&#774;meth does not mean "city of security," but city of truth or fidelity, i.e., in which truth and fidelity towards the Lord have their home. The temple mountain will be called the holy mountain, i.e., will be so, and will be recognised and known as being so, from the fact that Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, will sanctify it by His dwelling there. Jerusalem did not acquire this character in the period after the captivity, in which, though not defiled by gross idolatry, as in the times before the captivity, it was polluted by other moral abominations no less than it had been before. Jerusalem becomes a faithful city for the first time through the Messiah, and it is through Him that the temple mountain first really becomes the holy mountain. The opinion, that there is nothing in the promises in <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/8-3.htm">Zechariah 8:3-13</a> that did not really happen to Israel in the period from Zerubbabel to Christ (Kliefoth, Koehler, etc.), is proved to be incorrect by the very words, both of this verse and also of <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/8-6.htm">Zechariah 8:6</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/8-7.htm">Zechariah 8:7</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/8-8.htm">Zechariah 8:8</a>, which follow. How could the simple restoration of the previous covenant relation be described in <a href="/zechariah/8-6.htm">Zechariah 8:6</a> as something that appeared miraculous and incredible to the nation? There is only so much correctness in the view in question, that the promise does not refer exclusively to the Messianic times, but that feeble commencements of its fulfilment accompanied the completion of the work of building the temple, and the restoration of Jerusalem by Nehemiah. But the saying which follows proves that these commencements do not exhaust the meaning of the words. </body></html>
