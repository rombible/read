And the same sins seem to have been commonly practised before and at the time of Christ’s appearance, till the destruction of Jerusalem. No nation was more given to charms, divinations, and fortune-telling, than the Jews were about that time, as Dr. Lightfoot has shown out of their own authors. Adulterers were then so common, that the Sanhedrim ordained that the trial of an adulteress, prescribed Numbers 5., should no longer be put in practice, as the same author observes out of the Talmud. Josephus informs us that magicians swarmed in Judea, under the government of Felix, and afterward. The denunciation here, that God would come near to judgment with all these, and be a swift witness against them, was fulfilled by that terrible destruction which was made of them by the Romans when Jerusalem was taken, and such havoc was made of the nation as never happened to any people before.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/malachi/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:1-6 The first words of this chapter seem an answer to the scoffers of those days. Here is a prophecy of the appearing of John the Baptist. He is Christ's harbinger. He shall prepare the way before him, by calling men to repentance. The Messiah had been long called, He that should come, and now shortly he will come. He is the Messenger of the covenant. Those who seek Jesus, shall find pleasure in him, often when not looked for. The Lord Jesus, prepares the sinner's heart to be his temple, by the ministry of his word and the convictions of his Spirit, and he enters it as the Messenger of peace and consolation. No hypocrite or formalist can endure his doctrine, or stand before his tribunal. Christ came to distinguish men, to separate between the precious and the vile. He shall sit as a Refiner. Christ, by his gospel, shall purify and reform his church, and by his Spirit working with it, shall regenerate and cleanse souls. He will take away the dross found in them. He will separate their corruptions, which render their faculties worthless and useless. The believer needs not fear the fiery trial of afflictions and temptations, by which the Saviour refines his gold. He will take care it is not more intense or longer than is needful for his good; and this trial will end far otherwise than that of the wicked. Christ will, by interceding for them, make them accepted. Where no fear of God is, no good is to be expected. Evil pursues sinners. God is unchangeable. And though the sentence against evil works be not executed speedily, yet it will be executed; the Lord is as much an enemy to sin as ever. We may all apply this to ourselves. Because we have to do with a God that changes not, therefore it is that we are not consumed; because his compassions fail not.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/malachi/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And I will come near to you to judgment - They had clamored for the coming of "the God of judgment;" God assures them that He will come to judgment, which they had desired, but far other than they look for. The few would be purified; the great mass of them (so that He calls them "you"), the main body of those who had so clamored, would find that He came as a Judge, not for them but against them.<p>And I will be a swift witness - o "In judging I will bear witness, and witnessing, I, the same, will bring forth judgment, saith the Lord; therefore, the judgment shall be terrible, since the judge is an infallible witness, whom the conscience of no one will be able to contradict."<p>God would be a "swift witness," as He had said before, "He shall come suddenly."

Theod. Jerome) "the Faithful and True witness," when He stands in the midst of the Church, as their Judge. God's judgments are always unexpected by those, on whom they fall. The sins are those especially condemned by the law; the use of magical arts as drawing men away from God, the rest as sins of special malignity. Magical arts were rife at the time of the Coming of our Lord;  and adultery, as shown in the history of the woman taken in adultery, when her accusers were convicted in their own consciences. (<a href="//biblehub.com/john/8-9.htm">John 8:9</a>, "adulterous generation." <a href="/matthew/12-39.htm">Matthew 12:39</a>. Lightfoot on <a href="/john/8-3.htm">John 8:3</a> quotes Sotah f. 47. 1. "From the time that homicides were multiplied, the beheading of the heifer ceased: from the time that adulterers were multiplied, the bitter waters ceased:" and Maimonides on Sotah, c. 3. "When the adulterers multiplied under the second Temple, the Sanhedrin abolished the ordeal of the adulteresses by the bitter water; relying on its being written, 'I will not visit your daughters when they commit whoredom, nor your spouses when they commit adultery.'" Lightfoot subjoins, "The Gemarists teach that Johanan ben Zacchai was the author of that advice, who was still alive, in the Sanhedrin, and perhaps among those who brought the adulteress before Christ. For some things make it probable, that the "scribes and Pharisees," mentioned here, were elders of the synagogue." Justin reproaches them with having fresh wives, wherever they went throughout the world. Dial. fin. p. 243. Oxford translation.)<p>Oppress the hireling - , literally "oppress the hire,"  i. e., deal oppressively in it. "Behold," says James Jam 5:4, "the hire of the laborers who have reaped down your fields, which is by you kept back by fraud, crieth; and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth." The mere delay in the payment of the wages of the laborer brought sin unto him, against whom he cried to God <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-14.htm">Deuteronomy 24:14-15</a>. It is no light sin, since it is united with the heaviest, and is spoken of as reaching the ears of God. The widow and the fatherless stand in a relation of special nearness to God.<p>And fear not Me - He closes with the central defect, which was the mainspring of all their sins, the absence of the fear of God. The commission of any of these sins, rife as they unhappily are, proves that those who did them had no fear of God.  "Nothing hinders that this should be referred to the first coming of Christ. For Christ, in preaching to the Jews, exercised upon them a judgment of just rebuke, especially of the priests, Scribes and Pharisees, as the Gospels show." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/malachi/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5.

"And the word of Jehovah of hosts came to me thus, <a href="/zechariah/7-5.htm">Zechariah 7:5</a>. Speak to all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying, When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and in the seventh (month), and that for seventy years, did ye, when fasting, fast to me? <a href="/zechariah/7-6.htm">Zechariah 7:6</a>. And when ye eat, and when ye drink, is it not ye who eat, and ye who drink? <a href="/zechariah/7-7.htm">Zechariah 7:7</a>. Does it not concern the words, which Jehovah has preached through the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and satisfied, and her towns round about her, and the south country and the low land were inhabited?" The thought of <a href="/zechariah/7-6.htm">Zechariah 7:6</a> and <a href="/zechariah/7-7.htm">Zechariah 7:7</a> is the following: It is a matter of indifference to God whether the people fast or not. The true fasting, which is well pleasing to God, consists not in a pharisaical abstinence from eating and drinking, but in the fact that men observe the word of God and live thereby, as the prophets before the captivity had already preached to the people. This overthrew the notion that men could acquire the favour of God by fasting, and left it to the people to decide whether they would any longer observe the previous fast-days; it also showed what God would require of them if they wished to obtain the promised blessings. For the inf. absol. see at <a href="/haggai/1-6.htm">Haggai 1:6</a>. The fasting in the seventh month was not the fast on the day of atonement which was prescribed in the law (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/23.htm">Leviticus 23</a>), but, as has been already observed, the fast in commemoration of the murder of Gedaliah. In the form &#1510;&#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; the suffix is not a substitute for the dative (Ges. 121, 4), but is to be taken as an accusative, expressive of the fact that the fasting related to God (Ewald, 315, b). The suffix is strengthened by &#1488;&#1504;&#1497; for the sake of emphasis (Ges. 121, 3). In <a href="/zechariah/7-7.htm">Zechariah 7:7</a> the form of the sentence is elliptical. The verb is omitted in the clause &#1492;&#1500;&#1493;&#1488; &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, but not the subject, say &#1494;&#1492;, which many commentators supply, after the lxx, the Peshito, and the Vulgate ("Are these not the words which Jehovah announced?"), in which case &#1488;&#1514; would have to be taken as nota nominativi. The sentence contains an aposiopesis, and is to be completed by supplying a verb, either "should ye not do or give heed to the words which," etc.? or "do ye not know the words?" &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1514;, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/1-11.htm">Zechariah 1:11</a>, in the sense of sitting or dwelling; not in a passive sense, "to be inhabited," although it might be so expressed. &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1492; is synonymous with &#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1496;&#1514; in <a href="/zechariah/1-11.htm">Zechariah 1:11</a>. &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;, in the sense indicated at the close of the verse, is construed in the singular masculine, although it refers to a plurality of previous nouns (cf. Ges. 148, 2). In addition to Jerusalem, the following are mentioned as a periphrasis for the land of Judah: (1) her towns round about; these are the towns belonging to Jerusalem as the capital, towns of the mountains of Judah which were more or less dependent upon her: (2) the two rural districts, which also belonged to the kingdom of Judah, viz., the negeb, the south country (which Koehler erroneously identifies with the mountains of Judah; compare <a href="/joshua/15-21.htm">Joshua 15:21</a> with <a href="/joshua/15-48.htm">Joshua 15:48</a>), and the shephe&#772;la&#770;h, or lowland along the coast of the Mediterranean (see at <a href="/joshua/15-33.htm">Joshua 15:33</a>). </body></html>
