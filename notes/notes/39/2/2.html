It is a covenant of life and peace; it assures all believers of all happiness, both in this world and in that to come. It is an honour to God's servants to be employed as his messengers. The priest's lips should not keep knowledge from his people, but keep it for them. The people are all concerned to know the will of the Lord. We must not only consult the written word, but desire instruction and advice from God's messengers, in the affairs of our souls. Ministers must exert themselves to the utmost for the conversion of sinners; and even among those called Israelites, there are many to be turned from iniquity. Those ministers, and those only, are likely to turn men from sin, who preach sound doctrine, and live holy lives according to the Scripture. Many departed from this way; thus they misled the people. Such as walk with God in peace and righteousness, and turn others from sin, honour God; he will honour them, while those who despise him shall be lightly esteemed.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/malachi/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>If ye will not lay to heart - , namely, the rebukes addressed to them, "to give glory to God." For the glory of God is the end and aim of the priesthood. This should be the principle and rule of their whole life,  "to the greater glory of God." "I will send the curse upon you," namely, that which He had threatened in the law upon disobedience; and will "curse your blessings," will turn your blessings into a curse. He does not say, I will send you curses instead of blessings, but, I will make the blessings themselves a curse. <a href="/psalms/69-23.htm">Psalm 69:23</a>. "The things which should have been to their wealth became to them an occasion of falling;" to the proud, the things which lift them up; to the gluttonous, their abundance; to the avaricious, their wealth; which, if used to the glory of God, become blessings, do, when self not God is their end, by God's dispensation and Providence, become a curse to them.  "The goods of nature, the goods of fortune, the goods of the Church allowed to you, I will turn to your greater damnation, permitting you to abuse them to pride; and your damnation shall be the more penal, the more good things ye have received from Me. Whence Christ declares in the Gospel <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/12-48.htm">Luke 12:48</a>, 'Unto whomever much is given, of him shall be much required. '"<p>Yea, I have cursed them - (literally, it), i. e., each one of the blessings, "already." God's judgments as well as His mercies are individual with a minute care, showing that it is His doing. The curse had already gone forth, and had begun to seize upon them from the time that they began to despise His Name. His judgments do not break in at once, but little by little, with warnings of their approach, that so we may turn to Him, and "escape the wrath to come." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/malachi/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. lay &#8230; to heart&#8212;My commands.<p>send a curse&#8212;rather, as Hebrew, "the curse"; namely, that denounced in De 27:15-26; 28:15-68.<p>curse your blessings&#8212;turn the blessings you enjoy into curses (Ps 106:15).<p>cursed them&#8212;Hebrew, them severally; that is, I have cursed each one of your blessings.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/malachi/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">If ye will not hear:</span> this <span class="ital">if</span> to the prophet was dubious, but to God, who sent the prophet, it was not doubtful; but it was for monition to the priests and Jews, and implied a condition of mercy if they would yet hear, but an inevitable curse if they did not hear. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">If ye will not lay it to heart; </span> if you do not consider what you hear, to do the good, to forbear the evil. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">To give glory unto my name, </span> by a due and holy manner of sacrificing and offering incense; in neglect of which you have greatly sinned, and dishonoured me, and polluted my name and altar. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I will even send a curse:</span> it is a comprehensive threat, many miseries in one word; it is a blast on their good hoped for, and it is poison in the good possessed, and when it is, as here, sent of God, it will surely do both, it will be a blast on hopes, it will be poison in what is possessed and should be enjoyed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Upon you; </span> all, both priests and people, but especially on the priests. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Your blessings; </span> all the good, sweet, necessary supports of life, and comforts of yourselves and yours. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I have cursed them already</span>; you have so long polluted my name, and would not reform, that I have already sent out the curse, and it is in part upon you, though you are not sensible of it, nor will feel it, and this is forerunner of greater curses yet coming, unless you repent. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Because ye do not lay it to heart:</span> the sin was great in that you polluted my name, but it becomes much greater when you add impenitence to it, and harden yourselves, and will not lay it to heart; therefore the curse is gone out with commission from God to seize you. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/malachi/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>If ye will not hear,....

These God would not ratify, but would turn them into curses, and thus punish the people who connived at and imitated the iniquities of the priests. Or the expression may refer to the material benefits promised by God to the Israelites on their obedience. But as the announcement is made specially to the priests, this explanation seems less probable. <span class="cmt_word">I have cursed them already.</span> The curse has already begun to work. Dr. S. Cox ('Bible Educator,' 3:67, etc.) points out here an allusion to <a href="/nehemiah/13-1.htm">Nehemiah 13:1, 2</a>, wherein it is recorded that they reed from the Book of Moses how that the Moabites "hired Balsam against them that he should curse them; howbeit our God turned the curse into a blessing." Malachi, who, as he thinks, was present on this occasion, may have been deeply impressed by these words; and it is probable that we hear an echo of them in the threat of ver. 2. "That of old God had turned a curse into a blessing, may have suggested the menace that he would now turn a blessing into a curse." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/zechariah/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div><a href="/zechariah/5-9.htm">Zechariah 5:9</a>. "And I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and behold there came forth two women, and wind in their wings, and they had wings like a stork's wings; and they carried the ephah between earth and heaven. <a href="/zechariah/5-10.htm">Zechariah 5:10</a>. And I said to the angel that talked with me, Whither are these taking the ephah? <a href="/zechariah/5-11.htm">Zechariah 5:11</a>. And he said to me, To build it a dwelling in the land of Shinar: and it will be placed and set up there upon its stand." The meaning of this new scene may easily be discovered. The ephah with the woman in it is carried away between earth and heaven, i.e., through the air. Women carry it because there is a woman inside; and two women, because two persons are required to carry so large and heavy a measure, that they may lay hold of it on both sides (&#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1504;&#1492; with the &#1488; dropped; cf. Ges. 74, Anm. 4). These women have wings, because it passes through the air; and a stork's wings, because these birds have broad pinions, and not because the stork is a bird of passage or an unclean bird. The wings are filled with wind, that they may be able to carry their burden with greater velocity through the air. The women denote the instruments or powers employed by God to carry away the sinners out of His congregation, without any special allusion to this or the other historical nation. This is all that we have to seek for in these features, which only serve to give distinctness to the picture. But the statement in <a href="/zechariah/5-11.htm">Zechariah 5:11</a> is significant: "to build it a house in the land of Shinar." The pronoun &#1500;&#1492; with the suffix softened instead of &#1500;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468;, as in <a href="/exodus/9-18.htm">Exodus 9:18</a>; <a href="/leviticus/13-4.htm">Leviticus 13:4</a> (cf. Ewald, 247, d), refers grammatically to &#1492;&#1488;&#1497;&#1508;&#1492;; but so far as the sense is concerned, it refers to the woman sitting in the ephah, since a house is not built for a measure, but only for men to dwell in. This also applies to the feminine form &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1514;&#1495;&#1492;, and to the suffix in &#1502;&#1499;&#1504;&#1514;&#1492;&#1468;. The building of a house indicates that the woman is to dwell there permanently, as is still more clearly expressed in the second hemistich.  &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1503;  refers to  &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; , and is not to be taken hypothetically, in the sense of "as soon as the house shall be restored," but is a perfect with Vav consec.; and hu&#772;khan, the hophal of ku&#772;n, is not to be taken in the sense of restoring, but, in correspondence with mekhuna&#770;h, in the sense of establishing or building on firm foundations. Mekhuna&#770;h: the firmly established house. In this the woman of sin is brought to rest. The land in which the woman of sin carried away out of the holy land is permanently to dwell, is the land of Shinar. This name is not to be identified with Babel, so as to support the conclusion that it refers to a fresh removal of the people of Israel into exile; but according to <a href="/genesis/10-10.htm">Genesis 10:10</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/11-2.htm">Genesis 11:2</a>, Shinar is the land in which Nimrod founded the first empire, and where the human race built the tower of Babel which was to reach to the sky. The name is not to be taken geographically here as an epithet applied to Mesopotamia, but is a notional or real definition, which affirms that the ungodliness carried away out of the sphere of the people of God will have its permanent settlement in the sphere of the imperial power that is hostile to God. The double vision of this chapter, therefore, shows the separation of the wicked from the congregation of the Lord, and their banishment into and concentration within the ungodly kingdom of the world. This distinction and separation commenced with the coming of the Messiah, and runs through all the ages of the spread and development of the Christian church, until at the time of the end they will come more and more into outward manifestation; and the evil, having been sifted out by the judicial power of God and His Spirit, will form itself into a Babel of the last days, as <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/38.htm">Ezekiel 38</a> and 39 clearly show, and attempt a last struggle with the kingdom of God, in which it will be overcome and destroyed by the last judgment. </body></html>
