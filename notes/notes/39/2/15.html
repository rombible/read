In contempt of the marriage covenant, which God instituted, the Jews put away the wives they had of their own nation, probably to make room for strange wives. They made their lives bitter to them; yet, in the sight of others, they pretend to be tender of them. Consider she is thy wife; thy own; the nearest relation thou hast in the world. The wife is to be looked on, not as a servant, but as a companion to the husband. There is an oath of God between them, which is not to be trifled with. Man and wife should continue to their lives' end, in holy love and peace. Did not God make one, one Eve for one Adam? Yet God could have made another Eve. Wherefore did he make but one woman for one man? It was that the children might be made a seed to serve him. Husbands and wives must live in the fear of God, that their seed may be a godly seed. The God of Israel saith that he hateth putting away. Those who would be kept from sin, must take heed to their spirits, for there all sin begins. Men will find that their wrong conduct in their families springs from selfishness, which disregards the welfare and happiness of others, when opposed to their own passions and fancies. It is wearisome to God to hear people justify themselves in wicked practices. Those who think God can be a friend to sin, affront him, and deceive themselves. The scoffers said, Where is the God of judgement? but the day of the Lord will come.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/malachi/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And did not He - , God, of whom he had spoken as the witness between man and his wife, "make one," namely, Adam first, to mark the oneness of marriage and make it a law of nature, appointing "that out of man (created in His own image and similitude), woman should take her beginning, and, knitting them together, did teach that it should never be lawful to put asunder those, whom He by matrimony had made one?"   "Between those two, and consequently between all other married, to be born from them, He willed that there should be one indivisible union, for Adam could be married to no other save Eve, since no other had been created by God, nor could Eve turn to any other man than Adam, since there was no other in the world. 'Infringe not then this sanction of God, and unity of marriage, and degenerate not from your first parents, Adam and Eve.'"  "If divorce had been good, Jesus says, God would not have made one man and one woman, but, having made one Adam, would have made two women, had He meant that he should cast out the one, bring in the other; but now by the mode of creation, He brought in this law, that each should have, throughout, the wife which he had from the beginning. This law is older than that about divorce, as much as Adam is older than Moses."<p>Yet had he the residue of the spirit - <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>, "the breath of life, which He breathed into Adam, and man became a living soul." All the souls, which God would ever create, are His, and He could have called them into being at once. Yet in order to designate the unity of marriage, He willed to create but one. So our Lord argues against divorce <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/19-4.htm">Matthew 19:4-6</a>, "Have ye not read, that He which made them at the beginning, made them male and female?" They both together are called "one man" <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>, and, therefore, should be of one mind and spirit also, the unity of which they ought faithfully to preserve.<p>And wherefore one? - "Seeking a seed of God," i. e., worthy of God, for from religious marriage, religious offspring may most be hoped from God; and by violating that law, those before the flood brought in a spurious, unsanctified generation, so that God in His displeasure destroyed them all. "And take heed to your spirit,"  which ye too had from God, which was His, and which He willed in time to create. He closes, as he began, with an appeal to man's natural feeling, "let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/malachi/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15. Maurer and Hengstenberg explain the verse thus: The Jews had defended their conduct by the precedent of Abraham, who had taken Hagar to the injury of Sarah, his lawful wife; to this Malachi says now, "No one (ever) did so in whom there was a residue of intelligence (discriminating between good and evil); and what did the one (Abraham, to whom you appeal for support) do, seeking a godly seed?" His object (namely, not to gratify passion, but to obtain the seed promised by God) makes the case wholly inapplicable to defend your position. Moore (from Fairbairn) better explains, in accordance with Mal 2:10, "Did not He make (us Israelites) one? Yet He had the residue of the Spirit (that is, His isolating us from other nations was not because there was no residue of the Spirit left for the rest of the world). And wherefore (that is, why then did He thus isolate us as) the one (people; the Hebrew is 'the one')? In order that He might seek a godly seed"; that is, that He might have "a seed of God," a nation the repository of the covenant, and the stock of the Messiah, and the witness for the one God amidst the surrounding polytheisms. Marriage with foreign women, and repudiation of the wives wedded in the Jewish covenant, utterly set aside this divine purpose. Calvin thinks "the one" to refer to the conjugal one body formed by the original pair (Ge 2:24). God might have joined many wives as one with the one husband, for He had no lack of spiritual being to impart to others besides Eve; the design of the restriction was to secure a pious offspring: but compare Note, see on [1193]Mal 2:10. One object of the marriage relation is to raise a seed for God and for eternity.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/malachi/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">And did he, </span> God our Creator, not make one, but one man and one woman? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Yet had he the residue of the spirit; </span> yet he could have made more men and women; and if it had been good, and well-pleasing to him, he could have made many women for one man; but though by his power he could, yet in his wisdom, goodness, and holiness he would not make more; from the beginning marriage was ordained to be between one man and one woman alone at once.

That is, did not God make one man, and out of his rib one woman? did he not make man, male and female? did he not make one pair, one couple, only Adam and Eve, whom he joined together in marriage? or rather, did he not make one woman only, and brought her to Adam to be his wife? which shows that his intention and will were, that one man should have but one wife at a time; the contrary to which was the then present practice of the Jews: <p>Yet had he the residue of the spirit; it was not for want of power that he made but one woman of Adam's rib, and breathed into her the breath of life, or infused into her a human soul or spirit; he could have made many women at the same time; and as the Father of spirits, having the residue of them with him, or a power left to make as many as he pleased, he could have imparted spirits unto them, and given Adam more wives than one: <p>And wherefore one? what is the reason why he made but one woman, when he could have made ten thousand, or as many as he pleased? the answer is, <p>That he might seek a godly seed; or "a seed of God" (d); a noble excellent seed; a legitimate offspring, born in true and lawful wedlock; see <a href="/1_corinthians/7-14.htm">1 Corinthians 7:14</a> a seed suitable to the dignity of human nature, made after the image of God, and not like that of brute beasts, promiscuous and uncertain: <p>Therefore take heed to your spirit; to your affections, that they do not go after other women, and be led thereby to take them in marriage, and to despise and divorce the lawful wife, as it follows: <p>and let none deal treacherously with the wife of his youth; by marrying another, or divorcing her: these words are differently rendered and interpreted by some; but the sense given seems to be the true one, and most agreeable to the scope of the place. Some render the first clause, "hath not one made?" (e) that is, did not the one God, who is the only living and true God, make one man or one woman? and then the sense is the same as before; or did not that one God make, constitute, and appoint, that the woman should be the man's companion, and the wife of his covenant, as in the latter part of the preceding verse <a href="/malachi/2-13.htm">Malachi 2:13</a>? or, "did not one do?" (f) that is, so as we have done, take another wife besides the wife of his youth? and so they are the words of the people to the prophets, justifying their practice by example; by the example of Abraham, whom some of the Jewish writers think is intended by the "one", as in <a href="/isaiah/51-2.htm">Isaiah 51:2</a>. The Targum is, <p>"was not one Abraham alone, from whom the world was created?'' <p>or propagated. Kimchi gives it as his own sense, in these words; <p>"Abraham, who was one, and the father of all that follow him in his faith, did not do as ye have done; for he did not follow his lust, nor even marry Sarah, but so that he might cause the seed of God to remain;'' <p>yet he mentions it as his father's sense, that they are the words of the people to the prophet, expressed in a way of interrogation, saying, did not our father Abraham, who was one, do as we have done? who left his wife, and married Hagar his maid, though he had the residue or excellency of the spirit, and was a prophet; to whom the prophet replies, and what did that one seek? a godly seed; which is, as if it was said, when he married Hagar, it was to seek a seed, because he had no seed of Sarah his wife. A seed was promised him, in which all nations of the earth were to be blessed; he sought not to gratify his lust, but to obtain this seed, the Messiah, to whom the promises were made, as the apostle argues, <a href="/galatians/3-16.htm">Galatians 3:16</a> "he saith not, and to seeds as of many; but as of one, and to thy seed, which is Christ"; called here the "godly seed", or the "seed God" (g), as some choose to render the words; that is, that seed which is God, who is a divine Person, God and man in one person; or which is of God, of his immediate production, without the help of a man; which the Jews call the seed that comes from another place, and which they use as a periphrasis of the Messiah. So on those words in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/4-25.htm">Genesis 4:25</a>, "she called his name Seth, for God hath appointed me another seed", <p>"says R. Tanchuma, in the name of R. Samuel, she has respect to that seed which comes from another place; and what is this? this is the King Messiah (h).'' <p>And the same Rabbi elsewhere (i) observes, on those words in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/19-32.htm">Genesis 19:32</a>, "that we may preserve seed of our father", <p>"it is not written, that we may preserve a son of our father, but that we may preserve seed of our father; that seed which is he that comes from another place; and what is this? this is the King Messiah.'' <p>Now as Abraham had the promise of a son, and his wife was barren, he took the method he did that he might have one, the son of the promise, a type of the Messiah, and from whom he should spring; and this is sufficient to justify him in it: besides, he did not deal treacherously with Sarah his wife, for it was with her good will and by her authority he did this thing; but do you take heed to your spirit, that no one of you deal treacherously with the wife of his youth, to leave her, and marry the daughter of a strange God: and much the same sense Jarchi takes notice of as the Agadah, or the interpretation of their ancient Rabbins. Some render the words, "and not one does this"; that is, deals treacherously with the wife of his youth, that has the residue of the spirit, or the least spark of the Spirit of God in him; and how should anyone do it, seeking a godly seed? therefore take heed to your spirit, &amp;c.; so De Dieu.

The words are thus regarded as spoken by the Jews, who seek to shelter themselves from the prophet’s censure under the example of Abraham. “Did not one (Abraham)”, say they, “do it (that of which you complain in us, when he took to wife Hagar, the Egyptian)? And yet he had the residue of the spirit” (comp. <a href="/numbers/27-18.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Take you Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom is the spirit, and lay your hand on him;">Numbers 27:18</a> : “Joshua, the son of Nun, a man in whom is the spirit”). “And wherefore”, the prophet replies, “(did) the one (do it)? He was seeking (not as you are the gratification of his lust, but) a seed of God” (the son whom God had promised him. <a href="/genesis/16-2.htm" title="And Sarai said to Abram, Behold now, the LORD has restrained me from bearing: I pray you, go in to my maid; it may be that I may obtain children by her. And Abram listened to the voice of Sarai.">Genesis 16:2</a>). “Therefore”, seeing that Abraham’s example avails you nothing, “take head.” If this, however, were the argument, we might have expected the prophet to reply, that so far from divorcing (as they were doing) his proper wife, it was Hagar and not Sarah whom Abraham sent away, so soon as disagreement arose.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(2) The other line of interpretation is that adopted in A.V. and retained in R.V. According to it the prophet recalls them (as our Lord does in His argument with the Jews on the same subject, <a href="/context/mark/10-2.htm" title="And the Pharisees came to him, and asked him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife? tempting him....">Mark 10:2-9</a>) to the original institution of marriage and relation of the sexes. “Did not He (God) make one (one man, and out of him one woman, and the twain ‘one flesh’)? And (yet) the residue of the spirit (of life, comp. <a href="/genesis/7-22.htm" title="All in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was in the dry land, died.">Genesis 7:22</a> : ‘the breath of the spirit of life’) was His (so that He could, had it pleased Him, have created, for example, one man and many women). And why (did He make) the one? He sought (what only by the purity and integrity of the marriage bond can be secured) a godly seed.”<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/malachi/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And did not he make one? Yet had he the residue of the spirit.</span> The passage has always been a <span class="accented">crux</span>, and has received many interpretations. The Anglican rendering (which, however, is probably not correct) is thus explained: God made at first one man and one woman, to show the oneness of marriage, and God gave man the breath of life and the residue to the woman; he made them both equally living souls; therefore divorce was never contemplated in the first institution of marriage. Others take "one" to mean Abraham, and explain: Abraham did not do so, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> did not repudiate his legitimate wife, though barren; and he had a share of the spirit of right, or he had excellence of spirit. But these are very forced interpretations, and do not occur naturally from a consideration of the words. The Hebrew may be translated more satisfactorily, Not any one has done so who has a remnant of the spirit (<span class="accented">ruach</span>)." No one acts as you have done who has in him any of that Divine life which God at first breathed into man; in other words, no man of conscience and virtue has ever thus divorced his wife. The reading of the Septuagint varies here, the Vatican manuscript giving, <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>; "Did he not well?" and the Alexandrian, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>: but both seem to imply an interpretation such as we have just given. <span class="cmt_word">And wherefore one? That he might seek a godly seed.</span> Why did one act in this way? was it that he might have godly children? Surely not. No one would divorce his lawful Hebrew wife, and marry an idolatress, who wished to leave a holy posterity behind him. Many commentators, thinking that Abraham is here meant, and that the prophet is meeting an objection which might be founded upon his action with regard to Hagar, translate, "And what did the one? He was seeking a godly seed." Abraham at Sarah's request took Hagar to wife, in order to have the promised seed; he dismissed her in order to carry out the purpose of God in confining the promise to Isaac. Therefore his conduct is no support for those who repudiate their own wives and marry strange women, not to raise up children for God, but to satisfy their carnal lusts. It is difficult, however, to see how the prophet's hearers could have understood the allusion without further explanation. As Ribera pithily observes (quoted by Knabenbauer), "Neque ita clare ex re allata designatur (Abraham), ut non potius divinatione quam explicatione opus sit ad eum eruendum." It may also be remarked that the reference to the patriarch would not have been altogether successful, if the auditors remembered the Keturahites, who, though sprung from Abraham, were not "a godly seed." The LXX. has, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f34;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>; "And ye said, What else than seed doth God seek?" as if the increase of population, from whatever source, was the only object required. This may have been one thought of the people, but it can hardly be got out of the present Hebrew text. <span class="cmt_word">Take heed to your spirit.</span> Beware lest ye lose the spirit which God has given you. By acting thus contrary to conscience and the light vouchsafed to them, they ran the risk of being deprived altogether of this heavenly guide, and losing all distinction between right and wrong. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/zechariah/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The meaning of this is explained in <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/6-12.htm">Zechariah 6:12-15</a>. <a href="/zechariah/6-12.htm">Zechariah 6:12</a>.

Two things are stated in these verses concerning the crown: (1) In <a href="/zechariah/6-12.htm">Zechariah 6:12</a> and <a href="/zechariah/6-13.htm">Zechariah 6:13</a> the meaning is explained of the setting of the crown upon the head of Joshua the high priest; and (2) in <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/6-14.htm">Zechariah 6:14</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/6-15.htm">Zechariah 6:15</a>, an explanation is given of the circumstance, that the crown had been made of silver and gold presented by men of the captivity. The crowning of Joshua the high priest with a royal crown, which did not properly belong to the high priest as such, as his headdress is neither called a crown (&#8219;a&#774;ta&#770;ra&#770;h) nor formed part of the insignia of royal dignity and glory, had a typical significance. It pointed to a man who would sit upon his throne as both ruler and priest, that is to say, would combine both royalty and priesthood in his own person and rank. The expression "Speak thou to him" shows that the words of Jehovah are addressed to Joshua, and to him alone (&#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; is singular), and therefore that Zerubbabel must not be interpolated into <a href="/zechariah/6-11.htm">Zechariah 6:11</a> along with Joshua. The man whom Joshua is to represent or typify, by having a crown placed upon his head, is designated as the Messiah, by the name Tsemach (see at <a href="/zechariah/3-8.htm">Zechariah 3:8</a>); and this name is explained by the expression &#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493; &#1497;&#1510;&#1502;&#1495;. These words must not be taken impersonally, in the sense of "under him will it sprout" (lxx, Luth., Calov., Hitzig, Maurer, and others); for this thought cannot be justified from the usage of the language, to say nothing of its being quite remote from the context, since we have &#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493;, and not &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493; (under him); and moreover, the change of subject in &#1497;&#1510;&#1502;&#1495; and &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1504;&#1492; would be intolerably harsh. In addition to this, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-15.htm">Jeremiah 33:15</a>, the Messiah is called Tsemach, because Jehovah causes a righteous growth to spring up to David, so that Tsemach is the sprouting one, and not he who makes others or something else to sprout. &#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493;, "from under himself," is equivalent to "from his place" (<a href="/exodus/10-23.htm">Exodus 10:23</a>), i.e., from his soil; and is correctly explained by Alting in Hengstenberg thus: "both as to his nation and as to his country, of the house of David, Judah, and Abraham, to whom the promises were made." It also contains an allusion to the fact that He will grow from below upwards, from lowliness to eminence.<p>This Sprout will build the temple of the Lord. That these words do not refer to the building of the earthly temple of stone and wood, as Ros. and Hitzig with the Rabbins suppose, is so obvious, that even Koehler has given up this view here, and understands the words, as Hengstenberg, Tholuck, and others do, as relating to the spiritual temple, of which the tabernacle and the temples of both Solomon and Zerubbabel were only symbols, the temple which is the church of God itself (<a href="/hosea/8-1.htm">Hosea 8:1</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-5.htm">1 Peter 2:5</a>; <a href="/hebrews/3-6.htm">Hebrews 3:6</a>; and <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/2-21.htm">Ephesians 2:21-22</a>). Zechariah not only speaks of this temple here, but also in <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/4-9.htm">Zechariah 4:9</a>, as Haggai had done before him, in <a href="//biblehub.com/haggai/2-6.htm">Haggai 2:6-9</a>, which puts the correctness of our explanation of these passages beyond the reach of doubt. The repetition of this statement in <a href="/zechariah/6-13.htm">Zechariah 6:13</a> is not useless, but serves, as the emphatic &#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; before this and the following sentence shows, to bring the work of the Tsemach into connection with the place He will occupy, in other words, to show the glory of the temple to be built. The two clauses are to be linked together thus: "He who will build the temple, the same will carry eminence." There is no "antithesis to the building of the temple by Joshua and Zerubbabel" (Koehler) in &#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;; but this is quite as foreign to the context as another view of the same commentator, viz., that <a href="/zechariah/6-13.htm">Zechariah 6:13</a> interrupts the explanation of what the shoot is to be. &#1492;&#1493;&#1491;, eminence, is the true word for regal majesty (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/22-18.htm">Jeremiah 22:18</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/29-25.htm">1 Chronicles 29:25</a>; <a href="/daniel/11-21.htm">Daniel 11:21</a>). In this majesty He will sit upon His throne and rule, also using His regal dignity and power for the good of His people, and will be a Priest upon His throne, i.e., will be at once both Priest and King upon the throne which He assumes. The rendering, "And there will be a priest upon His throne" (Ewald and Hitzig), is precluded by the simple structure of the sentences, and still more by the strangeness of the thought which it expresses; for the calling of a priest in relation to God and the people is not to sit upon a throne, but to stand before Jehovah (cf. <a href="/judges/20-28.htm">Judges 20:28</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/17-12.htm">Deuteronomy 17:12</a>). Even the closing words of this verse, "And a counsel of peace will be between them both," do not compel us to introduce a priest sitting upon the throne into the text by the side of the Tsemach ruling upon His throne. &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; cannot be taken as a neuter in the sense of "between the regal dignity of the Messiah and His priesthood" (Capp., Ros.), and does not even refer to the Tsemach and Jehovah, but to the Mo&#772;she&#772;l and Ko&#772;he&#772;n, who sit upon the throne, united in one person, in the Tsemach. Between these two there will be &#8219;a&#774;tsath sha&#770;lo&#772;m. This does not merely mean, "the most perfect harmony will exist" (Hofmann, Umbreit), for that is a matter of course, and does not exhaust the meaning of the words. &#8219;Atsath sha&#770;lo&#772;m, counsel of peace, is not merely peaceful, harmonious consultation, but consultation which has peace for its object; and the thought is the following: The Messiah, who unites in Himself royalty and priesthood, will counsel and promote the peace of His people.<p>This is the typical meaning of the crowning of the high priest Joshua. But another feature is added to this. The crown, which has been placed upon the head of Joshua, to designate him as the type of the Messiah, is to be kept in the temple of the Lord after the performance of this act, as a memorial for those who bring the silver and gold from the exiles in Babel, and &#1500;&#1495;&#1503; &#1489;&#1468;&#1503;&#1470;&#1510;, i.e., for the favour or grace of the son of Zephaniah. Che&#772;n is not a proper name, or another name for Josiah, but an appellative in the sense of favour, or a favourable disposition, and refers to the favour which the son of Zephaniah has shown to the emigrants who have come from Babylon, by receiving them hospitably into his house. For a memorial of these men, the crown is to be kept in the temple of Jehovah. The object of this is not merely "to guard it against profanation, and perpetuate the remembrance of the givers" (Kliefoth); but this action has also a symbolical and prophetic meaning, which is given in <a href="/zechariah/6-15.htm">Zechariah 6:15</a> in the words, "Strangers will come and build at the temple of the Lord." Those who have come from the far distant Babylon are types of the distant nations who will help to build the temple of the Lord with their possessions and treasures. This symbolical proceeding therefore furnishes a confirmation of the promise in <a href="//biblehub.com/haggai/2-7.htm">Haggai 2:7</a>, that the Lord will fill His temple with the treasures of all nations. By the realization of what is indicated in this symbolical proceeding, Israel will perceive that the speaker has been sent to them by the Lord of hosts; that is to say, not that Zechariah has spoken by the command of God, but that the Lord has sent the angel of Jehovah. For although in what precedes, only the prophet, and not the angel of Jehovah, has appeared as acting and speaking, we must not change the "sending" into "speaking" here, or take the formula &#1493;&#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; in any other sense here than in <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/2-13.htm">Zechariah 2:13</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/3-2.htm">Zechariah 3:2</a>, and <a href="/zechariah/4-9.htm">Zechariah 4:9</a>. We must therefore assume, that just as the words of the prophet pass imperceptibly into words of Jehovah, so here they pass into the words of the angel of Jehovah, who says concerning himself that Jehovah has sent him. The words conclude with the earnest admonition to the hearers, that they are only to become partakers of the predicted good when they hearken to the voice of their God. The sentence commencing with &#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492; does not contain any aposiopesis; there is no valid ground for such an assumption as this in the simple announcement, which shows no trace of excitement; but veha&#770;ha&#770;h may be connected with the preceding thought, "ye will know," etc., and affirms that they will only discern that the angel of Jehovah has been sent to them when they pay attention to the voice of their God. Now, although the recognition of the sending of the angel of the Lord involves participation in the Messianic salvation, the fact that this recognition is made to depend upon their giving heed to the word of God, by no means implies that the coming of the Messiah, or the participation of the Gentiles in His kingdom, will be bound up with the fidelity of the covenant nation, as Hengstenberg supposes; but the words simply declare that Israel will not come to the knowledge of the Messiah or to His salvation, unless it hearkens to the voice of the Lord. Whoever intentionally closes his eyes, will be unable to see the salvation of God.<p>The question whether the prophet really carried out the symbolical action enjoined upon him in <a href="/zechariah/6-10.htm">Zechariah 6:10</a>., externally or not, can neither be answered in the affirmative nor with a decided negative. The statement in <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/6-11.htm">Zechariah 6:11</a>, that the prophet who was hardly a goldsmith, was to make the crown, is no more a proof that it was not actually done, than the talmudic notice in Middoth iii., concerning the place where the crown was hung up in the temple, is a proof that it was. For &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1514; in <a href="/zechariah/6-11.htm">Zechariah 6:11</a> may also express causing to be made; and the talmudic notice referred to does not affirm that this crown was kept in the temple, but simply states that in the porch of the temple there were beams stretching from one wall to the other, and that golden chains were fastened to them, upon which the priestly candidates climbed up and saw crowns; and the verse before us is then quoted, with the formula &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; as a confirmation of this. </body></html>
