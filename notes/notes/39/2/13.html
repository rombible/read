In contempt of the marriage covenant, which God instituted, the Jews put away the wives they had of their own nation, probably to make room for strange wives. They made their lives bitter to them; yet, in the sight of others, they pretend to be tender of them. Consider she is thy wife; thy own; the nearest relation thou hast in the world. The wife is to be looked on, not as a servant, but as a companion to the husband. There is an oath of God between them, which is not to be trifled with. Man and wife should continue to their lives' end, in holy love and peace. Did not God make one, one Eve for one Adam? Yet God could have made another Eve. Wherefore did he make but one woman for one man? It was that the children might be made a seed to serve him. Husbands and wives must live in the fear of God, that their seed may be a godly seed. The God of Israel saith that he hateth putting away. Those who would be kept from sin, must take heed to their spirits, for there all sin begins. Men will find that their wrong conduct in their families springs from selfishness, which disregards the welfare and happiness of others, when opposed to their own passions and fancies. It is wearisome to God to hear people justify themselves in wicked practices. Those who think God can be a friend to sin, affront him, and deceive themselves. The scoffers said, Where is the God of judgement? but the day of the Lord will come.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/malachi/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And this ye have done again - , adding the second sin of cruelty to their wives to the taking foreign women; "they covered the altar of God with tears," in that they by ill-treatment occasioned their wives to weep there to God; and God regarded this, as though they had stained the altar with their tears.<p>Insomuch that He regardeth not the offering anymore - God regarded the tears of the oppressed, not the sacrifices of the oppressors.

The transaction is the following: <a href="/zechariah/6-9.htm">Zechariah 6:9</a>. "And the word of Jehovah came to me thus: <a href="/zechariah/6-10.htm">Zechariah 6:10</a>. Take of the people of the captivity, of Cheldai, of Tobijah, and of Jedahyah, and go thou the same day, go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah, whither they have come from Babel; <a href="/zechariah/6-11.htm">Zechariah 6:11</a>. And take silver and gold, and make crowns, and set them upon the head of Joshua the son of Jozadak the high priest." By the introduction, "The word of the Lord came to me," the following transaction is introduced as a procedure of symbolical importance. It is evident from <a href="/zechariah/6-10.htm">Zechariah 6:10</a> and <a href="/zechariah/6-11.htm">Zechariah 6:11</a> that messengers had come to Jerusalem from the Israelites who had been left behind in Babel, to offer presents of silver and gold, probably for supporting the erection of the temple, and had gone to the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah. The prophet is to go to them, and to take silver and gold from them, to have a crown made for Joshua the high priest. The construction in <a href="/zechariah/6-10.htm">Zechariah 6:10</a> and <a href="/zechariah/6-11.htm">Zechariah 6:11</a> is somewhat broad and dragging. The object is wanting to the inf. absol. &#1500;&#1511;&#1493;&#1495;, which is used instead of the imperative; and the sentence which has been begun is interrupted by &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1488;&#1514; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;, so that the verb which stands at the head is resumed in the &#1493;&#1500;&#1511;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468; of <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/6-11.htm">Zechariah 6:11</a>, and the sentence finished by the introduction of the object. This view is the simplest one. For it is still more impracticable to take &#1500;&#1511;&#1493;&#1495; in an absolute sense, and either supply the object from the context, or force it out by alterations of the text (Hitzig). If, for example, we were to supply as the object, "that which they are bringing," this meaning would result: "accept what they are bringing, do not refuse it," without there being any ground for the assumption that there had been any unwillingness to accept the presents. The alteration of &#1502;&#1495;&#1500;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497; into &#1502;&#1495;&#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;, "my jewels," is destitute of any critical support, and &#1502;&#1495;&#1500;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497; is defended against critical caprice by the &#1500;&#1495;&#1500;&#1501; in <a href="/zechariah/6-14.htm">Zechariah 6:14</a>. Nor can &#1502;&#1488;&#1514; &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492; be taken as the object to &#1500;&#1511;&#1493;&#1495;, "take (some) from the emigration," because this thought requires &#1502;&#1503;, and is irreconcilable with &#1502;&#1488;&#1514;, "from with." Haggo&#772;la&#770;h, lit., the wandering into exile, then those who belong to the wandering, or to the exiled, not merely those who are still in exile, but very frequently also those who have returned from exile. This is the meaning here, as in <a href="/ezra/4-1.htm">Ezra 4:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/6-19.htm">Ezra 6:19</a>, etc. Mecheldai is an abbreviation for &#1502;&#1488;&#1514; &#1495;&#1500;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;. Cheldai, Tobiyah, and Yedahyah, were the persons who had come from Babylon to bring the present. This is implied in the words &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; &#1502;&#1489;, whither they have come from Babel. &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; is an accus. loci, pointing back to &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;. We are not warranted in interpreting the names of these men symbolically or typically, either by the circumstance that the names have an appellative meaning, like all proper names in Hebrew, or by the fact that Cheldai is written Che&#772;lem in <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/6-14.htm">Zechariah 6:14</a>, and that instead of Josiah we have there apparently che&#772;n. For che&#772;n is not a proper name (see at <a href="/zechariah/6-14.htm">Zechariah 6:14</a>), and che&#772;lem, i.e., strength, is not materially different from Cheldai, i.e., the enduring one; so that it is only a variation of the name, such as we often meet with. The definition "on that day" can only point back to the day mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/1-7.htm">Zechariah 1:7</a>, on which Zechariah saw the night-visions, so that it defines the chronological connection between this symbolical transaction and those night-visions. For, with the explanation given by C. B. Michaelis, "die isto quo scil. facere debes quae nunc mando," the definition of the time is unmeaning. If God had defined the day more precisely to the prophet in the vision, the prophet would have recorded it. Zechariah is to have given to him as much of the silver and gold which they have brought with them as is required to make &#8219;a&#774;ta&#770;ro&#772;th. The plural &#8219;a&#774;ta&#770;ro&#772;th does indeed apparently point to at least two crowns, say a silver and a golden one, as C. B. Michaelis and Hitzig suppose. But what follows cannot be made to harmonize with this. The prophet is to put the &#8219;a&#774;ta&#770;ro&#772;th upon Joshua's head. But you do not put two or more crowns upon the head of one man; and the indifference with which Ewald, Hitzig, and Bunsen interpolate the words &#1494;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1489;&#1500; &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; after &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;, without the smallest critical authority, is condemned by the fact that in what follows only one wearer of a crown is spoken of, and in <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/6-13.htm">Zechariah 6:13</a>, according to the correct interpretation, there is no "sharp distinction made between the priest and the Messiah." The plural &#8219;a&#774;ta&#770;ro&#772;th denotes here one single splendid crown, consisting of several gold and silver twists wound together, or rising one above another, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/31-36.htm">Job 31:36</a>, and just as in <a href="/revelation/19-12.htm">Revelation 19:12</a> (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;) Christ is said to wear, not many separate diadems, but a crown consisting of several diadems twisted together, as the insignia of His regal dignity. </body></html>
