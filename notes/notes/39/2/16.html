In contempt of the marriage covenant, which God instituted, the Jews put away the wives they had of their own nation, probably to make room for strange wives. They made their lives bitter to them; yet, in the sight of others, they pretend to be tender of them. Consider she is thy wife; thy own; the nearest relation thou hast in the world. The wife is to be looked on, not as a servant, but as a companion to the husband. There is an oath of God between them, which is not to be trifled with. Man and wife should continue to their lives' end, in holy love and peace. Did not God make one, one Eve for one Adam? Yet God could have made another Eve. Wherefore did he make but one woman for one man? It was that the children might be made a seed to serve him. Husbands and wives must live in the fear of God, that their seed may be a godly seed. The God of Israel saith that he hateth putting away. Those who would be kept from sin, must take heed to their spirits, for there all sin begins. Men will find that their wrong conduct in their families springs from selfishness, which disregards the welfare and happiness of others, when opposed to their own passions and fancies. It is wearisome to God to hear people justify themselves in wicked practices. Those who think God can be a friend to sin, affront him, and deceive themselves. The scoffers said, Where is the God of judgement? but the day of the Lord will come.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/malachi/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He hateth putting away - o He had allowed it "for the hardness of their hearts," yet only in the one case of some extreme bodily foulness  discovered upon marriage, and which the woman, knowing the law, concealed at her own peril. Not subsequent illness or any consequences of it, however loathsome (as leprosy), were a ground of divorce, but only this concealed foulness, which the husband "found" upon marriage. The capricious tyrannical divorce, God saith, "He hateth:" a word  Naturally used only as to sin, and so stamping such divorce as sin.<p>One covereth violence with his garment - o or, "and violence covereth his garment,"  or, it might be, in the same sense, "he covereth his garment with violence" , so that it cannot be hid, nor washed away, nor removed, but envelopes him and his garment; and that, to his shame and punishment.<p>It was, as it were, an outer garment of violence, as Asaph says <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/73-6.htm">Psalm 73:6</a>, "violence covereth them as a garment;" or David <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/109-18.htm">Psalm 109:18</a>, "he clothed himself with cursing as with a garment." It was like a garment with "fretting leprosy," unclean and making unclean, to be burned with fire. <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/13-47.htm">Leviticus 13:47-58</a>. Contrariwise, the redeemed saints had <a href="/revelation/7-14.htm">Revelation 7:14</a> "washed their robes and made them white in the Blood of the Lamb." Having declared God's hatred of this their doing, he sums up in the same words, but more briefly; "and this being so, ye shall take heed to your spirit, and not deal treacherously." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/malachi/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16. putting away&#8212;that is, divorce.<p>for one covereth violence with &#8230; garment&#8212;Maurer translates, "And (Jehovah hateth him who) covereth his garment (that is, his wife, in Arabic idiom; compare Ge 20:16, 'He is to thee a covering of thy eyes'; the husband was so to the wife, and the wife to the husband; also De 22:30; Ru 3:9; Eze 16:8) with injury." The Hebrew favors "garment," being accusative of the thing covered. Compare with English Version, Ps 73:6, "violence covereth them as a garment." Their "violence" is the putting away of their wives; the "garment" with which they try to cover it is the plea of Moses' permission (De 24:1; compare Mt 19:6-9).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/malachi/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The prophet enforceth his former exhortation, <span class="bld"><a href="/malachi/2-15.htm" title="And did not he make one?

The divorcing of wives; for though this was suffered because of the hardness of their hearts, it was not approved of by the Lord; nor was it from the beginning; and it was disagreeable, and even hateful to him, <a href="/matthew/19-8.htm">Matthew 19:8</a> in the margin of some Bibles the words are rendered, "if he hate her, put her away"; and so the Targum, <p>"but if thou hatest her, put her away;'' <p>to which agree the Vulgate Latin, Septuagint, and Arabic versions; and this sense made mention of in both Talmuds, and is thought to be agreeable to the law in <a href="/deuteronomy/24-3.htm">Deuteronomy 24:3</a> though the law there speaks of a fact that might be, and not of what ought to be; wherefore the former sense is best; and this other seems to have been at first calculated to favour the practice of the Jews, who put away their wives through hatred to them. The Jews were very much inclined to divorce their wives upon very trivial occasions; if they did not dress their food well, were not of good behaviour, or not so modest as became the daughters of Israel; if they did not find favour with their husbands; and, especially, if they had entertained a hatred of them: so says R. Judah (k), <p>"if he hate her, let him put her away:'' <p>but this is by some of them restrained to a second wife; for of the first they say, <p>"it is not proper to be hasty to put away a first wife; but a second, if he hates her, let him put her away (l)'' <p>and R. Eleazer says (m), whoever divorces his first wife, even the altar sheds tears for him, referring to the words in <a href="/malachi/2-13.htm">Malachi 2:13</a> and divorces of this kind they only reckon lawful among the Israelites, and found it upon this passage; for so they make God to speak after this manner (n), <p>"in Israel I have granted divorces; among the nations of the world I have not granted divorces. R. Chananiah, in the name of R. Phinehas, observes, that in every other section it is written, "the Lord of hosts"; but here it is written, "the God of Israel", to teach thee that the holy blessed God does not put his name to divorces (or allow them) but in Israel only. R. Chayah Rabba says, the Gentiles have no divorces.'' <p>But some of them have better understanding of these words, and more truly give the sense of them thus, as R. Jochanan does, who interprets them, <p>"the putting away of the wife is hateful (o);'' <p>it is so to God, and ought not to be done by men but in case of adultery, as our Lord has taught, <a href="/matthew/5-32.htm">Matthew 5:32</a> and which was the doctrine of the school of Shammai in Christ's time, who taught, <p>"that no man should divorce his wife, unless he found in her filthiness;'' <p>i.e. that she was guilty of adultery; though this Maimonides restrains to the first wife, as before: but the house of Hillell, who lived in the same time, was of a different mind, and taught that <p>"if she burnt his food;'' <p>continued...<a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/malachi/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For the LORD, the God of Israel, saith that he <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> hateth putting away: for <i>one</i> covereth <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> violence with his garment, saith the LORD of hosts: therefore take heed to your spirit, that ye deal not treacherously.</span><p>(b) Not that he allows divorce, but of two faults he shows which is the less.<p>(c) He thinks it sufficient to keep his wife still, even though he takes others, and so as it were covers his fault.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/malachi/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">16</span>. <span class="ital">the God of Israel</span>] who has given them His law.

The rendering of A.V. margin, which is also that of the LXX. and Targum, “if he hate her, put her away”, makes the prophet call upon those whom he is rebuking to avail themselves of the provision of the Law, as the least of two evils: q.d. “better divorce her if you hate her, as the Law allows you to do, than retain her as your wife only to subject her to insult and cruelty”. But apart from other objections, this interpretation loses sight of the fact that the motive of divorce in the two cases was entirely different, and that such advice, in the case here under consideration, is tantamount to saying, “If you wish to marry a heathen woman, get rid of your lawful wife first by divorcing her.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">for one covereth … his garment</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">and him that covereth his garment with violence</span> (R.V.) (do I hate), <span class="ital">saith the Lord of hosts</span>. Two things, in relation to the subject in hand, Almighty God declares that He hates. He hates “putting away”, for it is a violation of His primæval law, “What God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.” And He hates ill-treatment by the husband of his wife, which stains and pollutes, as it were, the garment of protection which he is bound to spread over her. By “his garment” many commentators understand “his wife”. But no such Hebrew use of the word has been adduced, and the Arabic use which is alleged is not conclusive.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/malachi/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He hateth putting away.</span> This is another reason against divorce: God hates it. It is contrary to his original institution, and was only allowed for the hardness of men's hearts (see <a href="/deuteronomy/24-1.htm">Deuteronomy 24:1</a>, etc.; <a href="/matthew/19-3.htm">Matthew 19:3-9</a>). Septuagint, "If thou hate her and dismiss her," etc.; Vulgate, "If thou hate her, put her away," which seems to encourage divorce, whereas in the context divorce is strongly condemned. Hence Jerome considers these words to be spoken by the Jews, quoting in their defence Moses' precept. Others think that they are ironical - Put her away, if you please; but you must bear the consequences. <span class="cmt_word">For one covereth violence with his garment.</span> He who thus divorces his wife shows himself openly to all beholders as an iniquitous man. So the clause is better rendered, <span class="accented">And one</span> (<span class="accented">who does so</span>) <span class="accented">covereth his garment with violence</span>, or, <span class="accented">violence</span> <span class="accented">covereth his garment.</span> Iniquity attaches itself to him plainly, encircling and enfolding him; the clothing of iniquity is the mark of the foul soul within. The notion of "garment" being here used figuratively for wife (as Hitzig supposes) is without proof. Such a metaphor is certainly unknown to Hebrew literature, though there is something like it in Arabic, "Wives are your attire, and ye are theirs" (Koran). Bishop Wordsworth considers that the phrase in the text refers to the custom of the bridegroom in espousals casting the skirt of his garment over her who was betrothed to him (see <a href="/ruth/3-9.htm">Ruth 3:9</a>). So the idea would be, "Ye cast your skirt over iniquity, and betroth violence to yourselves for a bride." But this seems somewhat forced. <span class="cmt_word">Take heed...  treacherously.</span> A repetition of the warning in ver. 15. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/zechariah/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The meaning of this is explained in <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/6-12.htm">Zechariah 6:12-15</a>. <a href="/zechariah/6-12.htm">Zechariah 6:12</a>. "And speak to him, saying, Thus speaketh Jehovah of hosts, saying, Behold a man, His name is Tsemach (Sprout), and from His place will He sprout up, and build the temple of Jehovah. <a href="/zechariah/6-13.htm">Zechariah 6:13</a>. And He will build the temple of Jehovah, and He will carry loftiness, and will sit and rule upon His throne, and will be a priest upon His throne, and the counsel of peace will be between them both. <a href="/zechariah/6-14.htm">Zechariah 6:14</a>. And the crown will be to Chelem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedahjah, and the favour of the son of Zephaniah, for a memorial in the temple of Jehovah. <a href="/zechariah/6-15.htm">Zechariah 6:15</a>. And they that are far off will come and build at the temple of Jehovah; then will ye know that Jehovah of hosts hath sent me to you; and it will come to pass, if ye hearken to the voice of Jehovah your God." Two things are stated in these verses concerning the crown: (1) In <a href="/zechariah/6-12.htm">Zechariah 6:12</a> and <a href="/zechariah/6-13.htm">Zechariah 6:13</a> the meaning is explained of the setting of the crown upon the head of Joshua the high priest; and (2) in <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/6-14.htm">Zechariah 6:14</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/6-15.htm">Zechariah 6:15</a>, an explanation is given of the circumstance, that the crown had been made of silver and gold presented by men of the captivity. The crowning of Joshua the high priest with a royal crown, which did not properly belong to the high priest as such, as his headdress is neither called a crown (&#8219;a&#774;ta&#770;ra&#770;h) nor formed part of the insignia of royal dignity and glory, had a typical significance. It pointed to a man who would sit upon his throne as both ruler and priest, that is to say, would combine both royalty and priesthood in his own person and rank. The expression "Speak thou to him" shows that the words of Jehovah are addressed to Joshua, and to him alone (&#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; is singular), and therefore that Zerubbabel must not be interpolated into <a href="/zechariah/6-11.htm">Zechariah 6:11</a> along with Joshua. The man whom Joshua is to represent or typify, by having a crown placed upon his head, is designated as the Messiah, by the name Tsemach (see at <a href="/zechariah/3-8.htm">Zechariah 3:8</a>); and this name is explained by the expression &#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493; &#1497;&#1510;&#1502;&#1495;. These words must not be taken impersonally, in the sense of "under him will it sprout" (lxx, Luth., Calov., Hitzig, Maurer, and others); for this thought cannot be justified from the usage of the language, to say nothing of its being quite remote from the context, since we have &#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493;, and not &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493; (under him); and moreover, the change of subject in &#1497;&#1510;&#1502;&#1495; and &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1504;&#1492; would be intolerably harsh. In addition to this, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-15.htm">Jeremiah 33:15</a>, the Messiah is called Tsemach, because Jehovah causes a righteous growth to spring up to David, so that Tsemach is the sprouting one, and not he who makes others or something else to sprout. &#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493;, "from under himself," is equivalent to "from his place" (<a href="/exodus/10-23.htm">Exodus 10:23</a>), i.e., from his soil; and is correctly explained by Alting in Hengstenberg thus: "both as to his nation and as to his country, of the house of David, Judah, and Abraham, to whom the promises were made." It also contains an allusion to the fact that He will grow from below upwards, from lowliness to eminence.<p>This Sprout will build the temple of the Lord. That these words do not refer to the building of the earthly temple of stone and wood, as Ros. and Hitzig with the Rabbins suppose, is so obvious, that even Koehler has given up this view here, and understands the words, as Hengstenberg, Tholuck, and others do, as relating to the spiritual temple, of which the tabernacle and the temples of both Solomon and Zerubbabel were only symbols, the temple which is the church of God itself (<a href="/hosea/8-1.htm">Hosea 8:1</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-5.htm">1 Peter 2:5</a>; <a href="/hebrews/3-6.htm">Hebrews 3:6</a>; and <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/2-21.htm">Ephesians 2:21-22</a>). Zechariah not only speaks of this temple here, but also in <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/4-9.htm">Zechariah 4:9</a>, as Haggai had done before him, in <a href="//biblehub.com/haggai/2-6.htm">Haggai 2:6-9</a>, which puts the correctness of our explanation of these passages beyond the reach of doubt. The repetition of this statement in <a href="/zechariah/6-13.htm">Zechariah 6:13</a> is not useless, but serves, as the emphatic &#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; before this and the following sentence shows, to bring the work of the Tsemach into connection with the place He will occupy, in other words, to show the glory of the temple to be built. The two clauses are to be linked together thus: "He who will build the temple, the same will carry eminence." There is no "antithesis to the building of the temple by Joshua and Zerubbabel" (Koehler) in &#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;; but this is quite as foreign to the context as another view of the same commentator, viz., that <a href="/zechariah/6-13.htm">Zechariah 6:13</a> interrupts the explanation of what the shoot is to be. &#1492;&#1493;&#1491;, eminence, is the true word for regal majesty (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/22-18.htm">Jeremiah 22:18</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/29-25.htm">1 Chronicles 29:25</a>; <a href="/daniel/11-21.htm">Daniel 11:21</a>). In this majesty He will sit upon His throne and rule, also using His regal dignity and power for the good of His people, and will be a Priest upon His throne, i.e., will be at once both Priest and King upon the throne which He assumes. The rendering, "And there will be a priest upon His throne" (Ewald and Hitzig), is precluded by the simple structure of the sentences, and still more by the strangeness of the thought which it expresses; for the calling of a priest in relation to God and the people is not to sit upon a throne, but to stand before Jehovah (cf. <a href="/judges/20-28.htm">Judges 20:28</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/17-12.htm">Deuteronomy 17:12</a>). Even the closing words of this verse, "And a counsel of peace will be between them both," do not compel us to introduce a priest sitting upon the throne into the text by the side of the Tsemach ruling upon His throne. &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; cannot be taken as a neuter in the sense of "between the regal dignity of the Messiah and His priesthood" (Capp., Ros.), and does not even refer to the Tsemach and Jehovah, but to the Mo&#772;she&#772;l and Ko&#772;he&#772;n, who sit upon the throne, united in one person, in the Tsemach. Between these two there will be &#8219;a&#774;tsath sha&#770;lo&#772;m. This does not merely mean, "the most perfect harmony will exist" (Hofmann, Umbreit), for that is a matter of course, and does not exhaust the meaning of the words. &#8219;Atsath sha&#770;lo&#772;m, counsel of peace, is not merely peaceful, harmonious consultation, but consultation which has peace for its object; and the thought is the following: The Messiah, who unites in Himself royalty and priesthood, will counsel and promote the peace of His people.<p>This is the typical meaning of the crowning of the high priest Joshua. But another feature is added to this. The crown, which has been placed upon the head of Joshua, to designate him as the type of the Messiah, is to be kept in the temple of the Lord after the performance of this act, as a memorial for those who bring the silver and gold from the exiles in Babel, and &#1500;&#1495;&#1503; &#1489;&#1468;&#1503;&#1470;&#1510;, i.e., for the favour or grace of the son of Zephaniah. Che&#772;n is not a proper name, or another name for Josiah, but an appellative in the sense of favour, or a favourable disposition, and refers to the favour which the son of Zephaniah has shown to the emigrants who have come from Babylon, by receiving them hospitably into his house. For a memorial of these men, the crown is to be kept in the temple of Jehovah. The object of this is not merely "to guard it against profanation, and perpetuate the remembrance of the givers" (Kliefoth); but this action has also a symbolical and prophetic meaning, which is given in <a href="/zechariah/6-15.htm">Zechariah 6:15</a> in the words, "Strangers will come and build at the temple of the Lord." Those who have come from the far distant Babylon are types of the distant nations who will help to build the temple of the Lord with their possessions and treasures. This symbolical proceeding therefore furnishes a confirmation of the promise in <a href="//biblehub.com/haggai/2-7.htm">Haggai 2:7</a>, that the Lord will fill His temple with the treasures of all nations. By the realization of what is indicated in this symbolical proceeding, Israel will perceive that the speaker has been sent to them by the Lord of hosts; that is to say, not that Zechariah has spoken by the command of God, but that the Lord has sent the angel of Jehovah. For although in what precedes, only the prophet, and not the angel of Jehovah, has appeared as acting and speaking, we must not change the "sending" into "speaking" here, or take the formula &#1493;&#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; in any other sense here than in <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/2-13.htm">Zechariah 2:13</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/3-2.htm">Zechariah 3:2</a>, and <a href="/zechariah/4-9.htm">Zechariah 4:9</a>. We must therefore assume, that just as the words of the prophet pass imperceptibly into words of Jehovah, so here they pass into the words of the angel of Jehovah, who says concerning himself that Jehovah has sent him. The words conclude with the earnest admonition to the hearers, that they are only to become partakers of the predicted good when they hearken to the voice of their God. The sentence commencing with &#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492; does not contain any aposiopesis; there is no valid ground for such an assumption as this in the simple announcement, which shows no trace of excitement; but veha&#770;ha&#770;h may be connected with the preceding thought, "ye will know," etc., and affirms that they will only discern that the angel of Jehovah has been sent to them when they pay attention to the voice of their God. Now, although the recognition of the sending of the angel of the Lord involves participation in the Messianic salvation, the fact that this recognition is made to depend upon their giving heed to the word of God, by no means implies that the coming of the Messiah, or the participation of the Gentiles in His kingdom, will be bound up with the fidelity of the covenant nation, as Hengstenberg supposes; but the words simply declare that Israel will not come to the knowledge of the Messiah or to His salvation, unless it hearkens to the voice of the Lord. Whoever intentionally closes his eyes, will be unable to see the salvation of God.<p>The question whether the prophet really carried out the symbolical action enjoined upon him in <a href="/zechariah/6-10.htm">Zechariah 6:10</a>., externally or not, can neither be answered in the affirmative nor with a decided negative. The statement in <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/6-11.htm">Zechariah 6:11</a>, that the prophet who was hardly a goldsmith, was to make the crown, is no more a proof that it was not actually done, than the talmudic notice in Middoth iii., concerning the place where the crown was hung up in the temple, is a proof that it was. For &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1514; in <a href="/zechariah/6-11.htm">Zechariah 6:11</a> may also express causing to be made; and the talmudic notice referred to does not affirm that this crown was kept in the temple, but simply states that in the porch of the temple there were beams stretching from one wall to the other, and that golden chains were fastened to them, upon which the priestly candidates climbed up and saw crowns; and the verse before us is then quoted, with the formula &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; as a confirmation of this. </body></html>
