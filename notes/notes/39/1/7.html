The context shows that the words “polluted bread” means “food unfit to be offered.” “Polluted me” is the same as “profaned [my name]” (<a href="/malachi/1-12.htm" title="But you have profaned it, in that you say, The table of the LORD is polluted; and the fruit thereof, even his meat, is contemptible.">Malachi 1:12</a>); for in the Hebrew Scriptures “God” and “God’s name” are often equivalent expressions (Comp. <a href="/malachi/2-5.htm" title="My covenant was with him of life and peace; and I gave them to him for the fear with which he feared me, and was afraid before my name.">Malachi 2:5</a>). Keil takes the words, which he wrongly translates, “<span class= "ital">ye that offer polluted bread,</span>” as parallel to the words “despisers of my name,” and to a certain degree explanatory of them; while he finds the actual answer to the questions, “Wherein have we despised?” “Wherein have we polluted?” is given in the words, “In that ye say,” &c. He renders the passage thus:—<p>Saith the Lord of hosts unto you,<p>“Ye priests, who despise my name!”<p>And yet say, “Wherein have we despised thy name?”<p>“Ye who offer on mine altar polluted food.”<p>And yet say, “Wherein have we polluted thee?”<p>(<span class= "ital">Ans.</span>) [Ye have despised my name and polluted me], in that ye say, “The table of the Lord is contemptible.”<p>The error of this rendering consists in supposing that “offering polluted food,” which is anathrous, can be parallel to “Ye priests who despise my name,” which is defined by the definite article. In truth, the English Version is perfectly correct. We will repeat it with only the slightest possible verbal alterations. and with such parenthetical explanations as are required to make it quite intelligible:—Saith the Lord of hosts unto you, “O priests, that <span class= "ital">despise</span> my name!”<p>[This is the commencement of a prophetic rebuke to the priests; but they, in accordance with the prophet’s graphic style of writing, are supposed to catch him up at the first clause of his utterance.]<p>“But” [despisers of God’s name!] say ye, “wherein have we <span class= "ital">despised</span> thy name?”<p>(<span class= "ital">Ans.</span>) “Offering [as ye do] <span class= "ital">polluted</span> food upon mine altar.”<p>“ But,” say ye, “wherein have we <span class= "ital">polluted</span> thee?”<p>(<span class= "ital">Ans.</span>) “When, now, ye offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil?” &c.<p><span class= "bld">Say</span>—<span class= "ital">i.e., show by your conduct that such is your feeling. </span>“This was their inward thought . . . he puts these thoughts into abrupt, bold, hard words, which might startle them for their hideousness, as if he would say, this is what your acts mean.

By being <span class="ital">polluted </span>is to be understood, that it was not such as the law required. They diminished something, either in the quality or quantity of what the law commanded them to offer; either the bread was not made of good flour, or mixed with the required quantity of good oil. <span class="ital">And ye say, Wherein have we polluted thee? — </span>Or dishonoured, or had thee in contempt? The answer is ready, <span class="ital">In that ye say, The table of the Lord is contemptible — </span>You pretend, as a cover for your avarice, that the table or altar of the Lord is despised among the people, and that therefore they do not bring to it, by way of offering, that quantity of flour and oil which they should. Or the meaning is, By your actions you declare how little value you have for the worship of God, since you care not in how slight and contemptuous a manner it is performed. <span class="ital">And if ye offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil? — </span>The beasts to be offered were required to be perfect and without blemish, <a href="/context/leviticus/22-21.htm" title="And whoever offers a sacrifice of peace offerings to the LORD to accomplish his vow, or a freewill offering in beeves or sheep, it shall be perfect to be accepted; there shall be no blemish therein....">Leviticus 22:21-22</a>. <span class="ital">Offer it now to thy governor; will he be pleased with thee? — </span>Wilt thou be acceptable or welcome unto him, bringing him such a worthless present? It argues a great contempt of Almighty God, when men are less careful in maintaining the decencies of his worship than they are in giving proper respect to their superiors.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/malachi/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:6-14 We may each charge upon ourselves what is here charged upon the priests. Our relation to God, as our Father and Master, strongly obliges us to fear and honour him. But they were so scornful that they derided reproof. Sinners ruin themselves by trying to baffle their convictions. Those who live in careless neglect of holy ordinances, who attend on them without reverence, and go from them under no concern, in effect say, The table of the Lord is contemptible. They despised God's name in what they did. It is evident that these understood not the meaning of the sacrifices, as shadowing forth the unblemished Lamb of God; they grudged the expense, thinking all thrown away which did not turn to their profit. If we worship God ignorantly, and without understanding, we bring the blind for sacrifice; if we do it carelessly, if we are cold, dull, and dead in it, we bring the sick; if we rest in the bodily exercise, and do not make heart-work of it, we bring the lame; and if we suffer vain thoughts and distractions to lodge within us, we bring the torn. And is not this evil? Is it not a great affront to God, and a great wrong and injury to our own souls? In order to the acceptance of our actions with God, it is not enough to do that which, for the matter of it, is good; but we must do it from a right principle, in a right manner, and for a right end. Our constant mercies from God, make worse our slothfulness and niggardliness, in our returns of duty to God. A spiritual worship shall be established. Incense shall be offered to God's name, which signifies prayer and praise. And it shall be a pure offering. When the hour came, in which the true worshippers worshipped the Father in Spirit and in truth, then this incense was offered, even this pure offering. We may rely on God's mercy for pardon as to the past, but not for indulgence to sin in future. If there be a willing mind, it will be accepted, though defective; but if any be a deceiver, devoting his best to Satan and to his lusts, he is under a curse. Men now, though in a different way, profane the name of the Lord, pollute his table, and show contempt for his worship.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/malachi/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Offering polluted bread upon Mine altar - This, continuing on the words, "despisers of My Name," , is the answer to their question, "Wherein have we despised Thy Name?" "Bread" might stand, in itself, either for the showbread, or for the &#1502;&#1504;&#1495;&#1492;  mincha&#772;h, meal-offering, which was the necessary accompaniment of sacrifices and sometimes the whole.<p>But here the "polluted bread" cannot be the showbread, since this was not put upon the altar, but upon its own table; and although the altar is, as here, also called "a table" , in regard to the sacrifice hereon consumed, "the table" of the showbread is nowhere called "altar." The prophet then means by "bread," either the meal-offering, as representing the sacrifice, or the offerings by fire altogether, as in Ezekiel E<a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/44-7.htm">Zechariah 44:7</a>, "When ye offer My bread, the fat and the blood;" and in Leviticus  "the offerings of the Lord, made by fire, the bread of their God, do they offer;" and of the "peace-offering <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/3-11.htm">Leviticus 3:11</a>, the priest shall burn it upon the altar; the bread of the offering made by fire unto the Lord:" and specifically, of animals with blemish, as these, it is forbidden <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/22-25.htm">Leviticus 22:25</a>, "Neither from a stranger's hand shall ye offer the bread of your God of any of these, because their corruption is in them, blemishes in them: they shall not be accepted for you." It was, as it were, a feast of God with man, and what was withdrawn from the use of man by fire, was, as it were, consumed by God, to whom it was offered.<p>It was "polluted," in that it was contrary to the law of God which forbade to sacrifice any animal, "lame or blind" or with "any ill blemish," as being inconsistent with the typical perfection of the sacrifice. Even the Gentiles were careful about the perfection of their sacrifices.<p> "Blind is the sacrifice of the soul, which is not illumined by the light of Christ. Lame is his sacrifice of prayer, who comes with a double mind to entreat the Lord."  "He offereth one weak, whose heart is not established in the grace of God, nor by the anchor of hope fixed in Christ. These words are also uttered against those who, being rich, offer to the Creator the cheaper and least things, and give small alms."<p>"And ye say, Wherewith have we polluted Thee?"  It is a bold expression. Yet a word, to which we are but too ill-accustomed, which expresses what most have done, "dishonor God," comes to the same. Though less bold in expression, they are yet like in meaning <a href="/ezekiel/13-19.htm">Ezekiel 13:19</a>.

"Much more in the new law, in which the Sacrifice is Christ Himself our God, whence the Apostle says expressly <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-27.htm">1 Corinthians 11:27</a>, "Whoso eateth this bread and drinketh this cup of the Lord unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord."  "For when the sacraments are violated, Himself, whose sacraments they are, is violated." God speaks of our acts with an unveiled plainness, which we should not dare to use.  "As we are said to sanctify God, when we minister to Him in holiness and righteousness, and so, as far as in us lies, show that He is holy; so we are said to pollute Him, when we conduct ourselves irreverently and viciously before Him, especially in His worship, and thereby, as far as in us lies, show that He is not holy and is to be dishonored."<p>"In that ye say, the table of the Lord is contemptible," literally "contemptible is it," , and so any contemptible thing might be offered on it. They said this probably, not in words, but in deeds. Or, if in words, in plausible words.  "God doth not require the ornamenting of the altar, but the devotion of the offerers."  "What good is it, if we offer the best? Be what we offer, what it may, it is all to be consumed by fire."  "The pretext at once of avarice and gluttony!" And so they kept the best for themselves. They were poor, on their return from the captivity. Anyhow, the sacrifices were offered. What could it matter to God? And so they dispensed with God's law.<p> "So at this day we see some priests and prelates, splendid in their tables and feasts, sordid in the altar and temple; on the table are costly napkins and wine; on the altar torn linen and wine-mace  rather than wine."  "We pollute the bread, that is, the Body of Christ, when we approach the altar unworthily, and, being defiled, drink that pure Blood, and say, 'The table of the Lord is contemptible;' not that anyone dareth to say this, but the deeds of sinners pour contempt on the table of God." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/malachi/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. ye offer, &c.&#8212;God's answer to their challenge (Mal 1:6), "Wherein have we despised?"<p>polluted bread&#8212;namely, blemished sacrifices (Mal 1:8, 13, 14; De 15:21).

The "bread" (<span class="accented">lechem</span>) is not the shewbread, which was not offered on the altar, but the flesh of the offered victims (see <a href="/leviticus/3-11.htm">Leviticus 3:11, 16</a>; <a href="/leviticus/21-6.htm">Leviticus 21:6</a>; <a href="/leviticus/22-25.htm">Leviticus 22:25</a>). This was "polluted" in that it was not offered in due accordance with the ceremonial Law, as is further explained in the next verse. <span class="cmt_word">Wherein have we polluted thee?</span> They did not acknowledge the truth that (as St. Jerome says) "when the sacraments are violated, he himself, whose sacraments they are, is violated" (comp. <a href="/ezekiel/13-19.htm">Ezekiel 13:19</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/20-9.htm">Ezekiel 20:9</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/39-7.htm">Ezekiel 39:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The table of the Lord is contemptible.</span> This was the thought of their heart, if they did not give open expression to it in words. The "table of the Lord" (ver. 12) is the altar, on which were laid the sacrifices,  regarded as the food. of God, and to be eaten by the fire (<a href="/ezekiel/41-22.htm">Ezekiel 41:22</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/44-16.htm">Ezekiel 44:16</a>). They showed that they despised the altar by fancying that anything was good enough for offering thereon, as the next verse explains. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/zechariah/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div><a href="/zechariah/5-1.htm">Zechariah 5:1</a>. "And I lifted up my eyes again, and saw, and behold a flying roll. <a href="/zechariah/5-2.htm">Zechariah 5:2</a>. And he said to me, What seest thou? And I said, I see a flying roll; its length twenty cubits, and its breadth ten cubits. <a href="/zechariah/5-3.htm">Zechariah 5:3</a>. And he said to me, This is the curse that goeth forth over the whole land: for every one that stealeth will be cleansed away from this side, according to it; and every one that sweareth will be cleansed away from that side, according to it. <a href="/zechariah/5-4.htm">Zechariah 5:4</a>. I have caused it to go forth, is the saying of Jehovah of hosts, and it will come into the house of the thief, and into the house of him that sweareth by my name for deceit: and it will pass the night in the midst of his house, and consume both its beams and its stones." The person calling the prophet's attention to the vision, and interpreting it, is the angelus interpres. This is not specially mentioned here, as being obvious from what goes before. The roll (book-scroll, megilla&#770;h  equals  megillath se&#772;pher, <a href="/ezekiel/2-9.htm">Ezekiel 2:9</a>) is seen flying over the earth unrolled, so that its length and breadth can be seen. The statement as to its size is not to be regarded as "an approximative estimate," so that the roll would be simply described as of considerable size (Koehler), but is unquestionably significant. It corresponds both to the size of the porch of Solomon's temple (<a href="/1_kings/6-3.htm">1 Kings 6:3</a>), and also to the dimensions of the holy place in the tabernacle, which was twenty cubits long and ten cubits broad. Hengstenberg, Hofmann, and Umbreit, following the example of Kimchi, assume that the reference is to the porch of the temple, and suppose that the roll has the same dimensions as this porch, to indicate that the judgment is "a consequence of the theocracy" or was to issue from the sanctuary of Israel, where the people assembled before the Lord. But the porch of the temple was neither a symbol of the theocracy, nor the place where the people assembled before the Lord, but a mere architectural ornament, which had no significance whatever in relation to the worship. The people assembled before the Lord in the court, to have reconciliation made for them with God by sacrifice; or they entered the holy place in the person of their sanctified mediators, the priests, as cleansed from sin, there to appear before God and engage in His spotless worship. The dimensions of the roll are taken from the holy place of the tabernacle, just as in the previous vision the candlestick was the mosaic candlestick of the tabernacle. Through the similarity of the dimensions of the roll to those of the holy place in the tabernacle, there is no intention to indicate that the curse proceeds from the holy place of the tabernacle or of the temple; for the roll would have issued from the sanctuary, if it had been intended to indicate this. Moreover, the curse or judgment does indeed begin at the house of God, but it does not issue or come from the house of God. Kliefoth has pointed to the true meaning in the following explanation which he gives: "The fact that the writing, which brings the curse upon all the sinners of the earth, has the same dimensions as the tabernacle, signifies that the measure will be meted out according to the measure of the holy place;" and again, "the measure by which this curse upon sinners will be meted out, will be the measure of the holy place." With this measure would all sinners be measured, that they might be cut off from the congregation of the Lord, which appeared before God in the holy place.<p>The flight of the roll symbolized the going forth of the curse over the whole land. &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; is rendered by Hofmann, Neumann, and Kliefoth "the whole earth," because "it evidently signifies the whole earth in v. <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/4-10.htm">Zechariah 4:10</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/4-14.htm">Zechariah 4:14</a>, and <a href="/zechariah/6-5.htm">Zechariah 6:5</a>" (Kliefoth). But these passages, in which the Lord of the whole earth is spoken of, do not prove anything in relation to our vision, in which &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; is unmistakeably limited to the land of Canaan (Judah) by the antithesis in <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/5-11.htm">Zechariah 5:11</a>, "the land of Shinar." If the sinners who are smitten by the curse proceeding over &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; are to be carried into the land of Sinar, the former must be a definite land, and not the earth as the sum of all lands. It cannot be argued in opposition to this, that the sin of the land in which the true house of God and the true priesthood were, was wiped away by expiation, whereas the sin of the whole world would be brought into the land of judgment, when its measure was concluded by God; for this antithesis is foreign not only to this vision, but to the Scriptures universally. The Scriptures know nothing of any distribution or punishment of sins according to different lands, but simply according to the character of the sinners, viz., whether they are penitent or hardened. At the same time, the fact that &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; denotes the whole of the land of Israel, by no means proves that our vision either treats of the "carrying away of Israel into exile," which had already occurred (Ros.), or "sets before them a fresh carrying away into exile, and one still in the future" (Hengstenberg), or that on the coming of the millennial kingdom the sin and the sinners will be exterminated from the whole of the holy land, and the sin thrown back upon the rest of the earth, which is still under the power of the world (Hofmann). The vision certainly refers to the remote future of the kingdom of God; and therefore "the whole land" cannot be restricted to the extent and boundaries of Judaea or Palestine, but reaches as far as the spiritual Israel or church of Christ is spread over the earth; but there is no allusion in our vision to the millennial kingdom, and its establishment within the limits of the earthly Canaan. The curse falls upon all thieves and false swearers. &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506; in <a href="/zechariah/5-3.htm">Zechariah 5:3</a> is defined more precisely in <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/5-4.htm">Zechariah 5:4</a>, as swearing in the name of Jehovah for deceit, and therefore refers to perjury in the broadest sense of the word, or to all abuse of the name of God for false, deceitful swearing. Thieves are mentioned for the sake of individualizing, as sinners against the second table of the decalogue; false swearers, as sinners against the first table. The repetition of &#1502;&#1494;&#1468;&#1492; &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1492; points to this; for mizzeh, repeated in correlative clauses, signifies hinc et illinc, hence and thence, i.e., on one side and the other (<a href="/exodus/17-12.htm">Exodus 17:12</a>; <a href="/numbers/22-24.htm">Numbers 22:24</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/47-7.htm">Ezekiel 47:7</a>), and can only refer here to the fact that the roll was written upon on both sides, so that it is to be taken in close connection with &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1492;: "on this side ... and on that, according to it" (the roll), i.e., according to the curse written upon this side and that side of the roll. We have therefore to picture the roll to ourselves as having the curse against the thieves written upon the one side, and that against the perjurers upon the other. The supposition that mizzeh refers to &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; is precluded most decidedly, by the fact that mizzeh does not mean "thence," i.e., from the whole land, but when used adverbially of any place, invariably signifies "hence," and refers to the place where the speaker himself is standing. Moreover, the double use of mizzeh is at variance with any allusion to ha&#770;'a&#770;rets, as well as the fact that if it belonged to the verb, it would stand after &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1492;, whether before or after the verb. Niqqa&#770;h, the niphal, signifies here to be cleaned out, like &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; in <a href="/mark/7-19.htm">Mark 7:19</a> (cf. <a href="/1_kings/14-10.htm">1 Kings 14:10</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/17-12.htm">Deuteronomy 17:12</a>). This is explained in <a href="/zechariah/5-4.htm">Zechariah 5:4</a> thus: Jehovah causes the curse to go forth and enter into the house of the thief and perjurer, so that it will pass the night there, i.e., stay there (la&#770;neh third pers. perf. of lu&#772;n, from la&#770;na&#770;h, to be blunted, like zu&#770;reh in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/59-5.htm">Isaiah 59:5</a>, and other verbal formations); it will not remain idle, however, but work therein, destroying both the house and sinners therein, so that beams and stones will be consumed (cf. <a href="/1_kings/18-38.htm">1 Kings 18:38</a>). The suffix in &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; (for &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1514;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;, cf. Ges. 75, Anm. 19) refers to the house, of course including the inhabitants. The following nouns introduced with &#1493;&#1488;&#1514; are in explanatory apposition: both its beams and its stones. The roll therefore symbolizes the curse which will fall upon sinners throughout the whole land, consuming them with their houses, and thus sweeping them out of the nation of God. </body></html>
