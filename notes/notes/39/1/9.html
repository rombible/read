The word “God” is expressly used, rather than “the Lord,” as a contrast to the human “governor” mentioned above. The meaning is: “You know you dare not treat thus contemptuously your human governor, what hope then is there of such disrespectful conduct finding favour with God—the Judge of all the earth?”<p><span class= "bld">That he will be gracious.</span>—These words refer, perhaps, to the wording of the sacerdotal benediction (<a href="/numbers/6-24.htm" title="The LORD bless you, and keep you:">Numbers 6:24</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Unto us.</span>—The prophet includes himself with the people, as Moses did (<a href="/exodus/34-9.htm" title="And he said, If now I have found grace in your sight, O LORD, let my LORD, I pray you, go among us; for it is a stiff necked people; and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for your inheritance.">Exodus 34:9</a>): “And pardon <span class= "ital">our</span> iniquity and <span class= "ital">our</span> sin;” and as, in fact, God Himself included Moses (<a href="/exodus/16-28.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, How long refuse you to keep my commandments and my laws?">Exodus 16:28</a>): “And the Lord said unto Moses, How long refuse <span class= "ital">ye</span> to keep my commandments?”<p><span class= "bld">This hath been by your means.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">by your means hath this been. </span>“By <span class= "ital">your</span> means” is emphatic by position. The meaning is: “By means of <span class= "ital">you</span> (priests), who ought to have directed the people aright, has this disgraceful conduct been occasioned.” Or, perhaps, in view of <a href="/malachi/1-8.htm" title="And if you offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil? and if you offer the lame and sick, is it not evil? offer it now to your governor; will he be pleased with you, or accept your person? said the LORD of hosts.">Malachi 1:8</a>, and the wording of <a href="/malachi/1-10.htm" title="Who is there even among you that would shut the doors for nothing? neither do you kindle fire on my altar for nothing. I have no pleasure in you, said the LORD of hosts, neither will I accept an offering at your hand.">Malachi 1:10</a>, we should render the words thus: “From <span class= "ital">your</span> hands is this [despicable offering] !” <span class= "ital">This</span> being used contemptuously like Lat. <span class= "ital">istud.</span> In either case the clause is parenthetical, so that “will he regard” must be taken in close connection with the preceding, “beseech God that he will be gracious unto us.”<p><span class= "bld">Will he regard your persons?</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">will he, on your account, show favour to </span>‘<span class= "ital">any one?</span> That is, can ye be deemed worthy intercessors, when these are the actions ye perform? The question is, of course, a practical negation.

This is implied in the next verse.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/malachi/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:6-14 We may each charge upon ourselves what is here charged upon the priests. Our relation to God, as our Father and Master, strongly obliges us to fear and honour him. But they were so scornful that they derided reproof. Sinners ruin themselves by trying to baffle their convictions. Those who live in careless neglect of holy ordinances, who attend on them without reverence, and go from them under no concern, in effect say, The table of the Lord is contemptible. They despised God's name in what they did. It is evident that these understood not the meaning of the sacrifices, as shadowing forth the unblemished Lamb of God; they grudged the expense, thinking all thrown away which did not turn to their profit. If we worship God ignorantly, and without understanding, we bring the blind for sacrifice; if we do it carelessly, if we are cold, dull, and dead in it, we bring the sick; if we rest in the bodily exercise, and do not make heart-work of it, we bring the lame; and if we suffer vain thoughts and distractions to lodge within us, we bring the torn. And is not this evil? Is it not a great affront to God, and a great wrong and injury to our own souls? In order to the acceptance of our actions with God, it is not enough to do that which, for the matter of it, is good; but we must do it from a right principle, in a right manner, and for a right end. Our constant mercies from God, make worse our slothfulness and niggardliness, in our returns of duty to God. A spiritual worship shall be established. Incense shall be offered to God's name, which signifies prayer and praise. And it shall be a pure offering. When the hour came, in which the true worshippers worshipped the Father in Spirit and in truth, then this incense was offered, even this pure offering. We may rely on God's mercy for pardon as to the past, but not for indulgence to sin in future. If there be a willing mind, it will be accepted, though defective; but if any be a deceiver, devoting his best to Satan and to his lusts, he is under a curse. Men now, though in a different way, profane the name of the Lord, pollute his table, and show contempt for his worship.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/malachi/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And now entreat, I pray you, God o that He will be gracious unto you - This is not a call to repentance, for he assumes that God would not accept them. It is rather irony; "go now, seek the favor of God, as ye would not that of your governor." "From your hand," not from your fathers, not from aliens, "hath this been: will He accept persons from you?" The unusual construction seems to imply a difference of meaning; as if he would say, that it consisted not with the justice of God, that He should be an "accepter of persons," (which He declares that He is not) which yet He would be, were He to accept them, while acting thus. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/malachi/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. now &#8230; beseech God that he will be gracious&#8212;Ironical.

"And I lifted up my eyes again, and saw, and behold a flying roll. <a href="/zechariah/5-2.htm">Zechariah 5:2</a>. And he said to me, What seest thou? And I said, I see a flying roll; its length twenty cubits, and its breadth ten cubits. <a href="/zechariah/5-3.htm">Zechariah 5:3</a>. And he said to me, This is the curse that goeth forth over the whole land: for every one that stealeth will be cleansed away from this side, according to it; and every one that sweareth will be cleansed away from that side, according to it. <a href="/zechariah/5-4.htm">Zechariah 5:4</a>. I have caused it to go forth, is the saying of Jehovah of hosts, and it will come into the house of the thief, and into the house of him that sweareth by my name for deceit: and it will pass the night in the midst of his house, and consume both its beams and its stones." The person calling the prophet's attention to the vision, and interpreting it, is the angelus interpres. This is not specially mentioned here, as being obvious from what goes before. The roll (book-scroll, megilla&#770;h  equals  megillath se&#772;pher, <a href="/ezekiel/2-9.htm">Ezekiel 2:9</a>) is seen flying over the earth unrolled, so that its length and breadth can be seen. The statement as to its size is not to be regarded as "an approximative estimate," so that the roll would be simply described as of considerable size (Koehler), but is unquestionably significant. It corresponds both to the size of the porch of Solomon's temple (<a href="/1_kings/6-3.htm">1 Kings 6:3</a>), and also to the dimensions of the holy place in the tabernacle, which was twenty cubits long and ten cubits broad. Hengstenberg, Hofmann, and Umbreit, following the example of Kimchi, assume that the reference is to the porch of the temple, and suppose that the roll has the same dimensions as this porch, to indicate that the judgment is "a consequence of the theocracy" or was to issue from the sanctuary of Israel, where the people assembled before the Lord. But the porch of the temple was neither a symbol of the theocracy, nor the place where the people assembled before the Lord, but a mere architectural ornament, which had no significance whatever in relation to the worship. The people assembled before the Lord in the court, to have reconciliation made for them with God by sacrifice; or they entered the holy place in the person of their sanctified mediators, the priests, as cleansed from sin, there to appear before God and engage in His spotless worship. The dimensions of the roll are taken from the holy place of the tabernacle, just as in the previous vision the candlestick was the mosaic candlestick of the tabernacle. Through the similarity of the dimensions of the roll to those of the holy place in the tabernacle, there is no intention to indicate that the curse proceeds from the holy place of the tabernacle or of the temple; for the roll would have issued from the sanctuary, if it had been intended to indicate this. Moreover, the curse or judgment does indeed begin at the house of God, but it does not issue or come from the house of God. Kliefoth has pointed to the true meaning in the following explanation which he gives: "The fact that the writing, which brings the curse upon all the sinners of the earth, has the same dimensions as the tabernacle, signifies that the measure will be meted out according to the measure of the holy place;" and again, "the measure by which this curse upon sinners will be meted out, will be the measure of the holy place." With this measure would all sinners be measured, that they might be cut off from the congregation of the Lord, which appeared before God in the holy place.<p>The flight of the roll symbolized the going forth of the curse over the whole land. &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; is rendered by Hofmann, Neumann, and Kliefoth "the whole earth," because "it evidently signifies the whole earth in v. <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/4-10.htm">Zechariah 4:10</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/4-14.htm">Zechariah 4:14</a>, and <a href="/zechariah/6-5.htm">Zechariah 6:5</a>" (Kliefoth). But these passages, in which the Lord of the whole earth is spoken of, do not prove anything in relation to our vision, in which &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; is unmistakeably limited to the land of Canaan (Judah) by the antithesis in <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/5-11.htm">Zechariah 5:11</a>, "the land of Shinar." If the sinners who are smitten by the curse proceeding over &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; are to be carried into the land of Sinar, the former must be a definite land, and not the earth as the sum of all lands. It cannot be argued in opposition to this, that the sin of the land in which the true house of God and the true priesthood were, was wiped away by expiation, whereas the sin of the whole world would be brought into the land of judgment, when its measure was concluded by God; for this antithesis is foreign not only to this vision, but to the Scriptures universally. The Scriptures know nothing of any distribution or punishment of sins according to different lands, but simply according to the character of the sinners, viz., whether they are penitent or hardened. At the same time, the fact that &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; denotes the whole of the land of Israel, by no means proves that our vision either treats of the "carrying away of Israel into exile," which had already occurred (Ros.), or "sets before them a fresh carrying away into exile, and one still in the future" (Hengstenberg), or that on the coming of the millennial kingdom the sin and the sinners will be exterminated from the whole of the holy land, and the sin thrown back upon the rest of the earth, which is still under the power of the world (Hofmann). The vision certainly refers to the remote future of the kingdom of God; and therefore "the whole land" cannot be restricted to the extent and boundaries of Judaea or Palestine, but reaches as far as the spiritual Israel or church of Christ is spread over the earth; but there is no allusion in our vision to the millennial kingdom, and its establishment within the limits of the earthly Canaan. The curse falls upon all thieves and false swearers. &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506; in <a href="/zechariah/5-3.htm">Zechariah 5:3</a> is defined more precisely in <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/5-4.htm">Zechariah 5:4</a>, as swearing in the name of Jehovah for deceit, and therefore refers to perjury in the broadest sense of the word, or to all abuse of the name of God for false, deceitful swearing. Thieves are mentioned for the sake of individualizing, as sinners against the second table of the decalogue; false swearers, as sinners against the first table. The repetition of &#1502;&#1494;&#1468;&#1492; &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1492; points to this; for mizzeh, repeated in correlative clauses, signifies hinc et illinc, hence and thence, i.e., on one side and the other (<a href="/exodus/17-12.htm">Exodus 17:12</a>; <a href="/numbers/22-24.htm">Numbers 22:24</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/47-7.htm">Ezekiel 47:7</a>), and can only refer here to the fact that the roll was written upon on both sides, so that it is to be taken in close connection with &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1492;: "on this side ... and on that, according to it" (the roll), i.e., according to the curse written upon this side and that side of the roll. We have therefore to picture the roll to ourselves as having the curse against the thieves written upon the one side, and that against the perjurers upon the other. The supposition that mizzeh refers to &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; is precluded most decidedly, by the fact that mizzeh does not mean "thence," i.e., from the whole land, but when used adverbially of any place, invariably signifies "hence," and refers to the place where the speaker himself is standing. Moreover, the double use of mizzeh is at variance with any allusion to ha&#770;'a&#770;rets, as well as the fact that if it belonged to the verb, it would stand after &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1492;, whether before or after the verb. Niqqa&#770;h, the niphal, signifies here to be cleaned out, like &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; in <a href="/mark/7-19.htm">Mark 7:19</a> (cf. <a href="/1_kings/14-10.htm">1 Kings 14:10</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/17-12.htm">Deuteronomy 17:12</a>). This is explained in <a href="/zechariah/5-4.htm">Zechariah 5:4</a> thus: Jehovah causes the curse to go forth and enter into the house of the thief and perjurer, so that it will pass the night there, i.e., stay there (la&#770;neh third pers. perf. of lu&#772;n, from la&#770;na&#770;h, to be blunted, like zu&#770;reh in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/59-5.htm">Isaiah 59:5</a>, and other verbal formations); it will not remain idle, however, but work therein, destroying both the house and sinners therein, so that beams and stones will be consumed (cf. <a href="/1_kings/18-38.htm">1 Kings 18:38</a>). The suffix in &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; (for &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1514;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;, cf. Ges. 75, Anm. 19) refers to the house, of course including the inhabitants. The following nouns introduced with &#1493;&#1488;&#1514; are in explanatory apposition: both its beams and its stones.
