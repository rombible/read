All the evils sinners feel and fear, are the just recompence of their crimes, while all their hopes and comforts are from the unmerited mercy of the Lord. He chose his people that they might be holy.

Either gives an adequate sense. Human self-confidence will admit anything, as to the past; nay, will even exaggerate past evil to itself, "Crush us how they may, we will arise and repair our losses." So Ephraim said of old <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/9-9.htm">Isaiah 9:9-10</a>, "in the pride and stoutness of heart, The bricks are fallen down, but we will build with hewn-stones: the sycamores are cut down, but we will change them into cedars." It is the one language of what calls itself, "indomitable;" in other words, "untameable," conquerors or every other gambler; "we will repair our losses." All is again staked and lost.<p>"They shall call them the border of wickedness." Formerly, it had its own proper name, "the border of Edom," as other countries <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/10-14.htm">Exodus 10:14</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/10-19.htm">Exodus 10:19</a>, "all the border of Egypt <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-18.htm">Deuteronomy 2:18</a>, the border of Moab <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-3.htm">1 Samuel 11:3</a>, <a href="/1_samuel/11-7.htm">1 Samuel 11:7</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/27-1.htm">1 Samuel 27:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-12.htm">1 Chronicles 21:12</a>, the whole border of Israel <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-13.htm">2 Chronicles 11:13</a>, the border of Israel <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/11-22.htm">Judges 11:22</a>, the whole border of the Amorite." Henceforth, it should be known no more by its own name; but as "the border of wickedness," where wickedness formerly dwelt, and, hence, the judgment of God and desolation from Him came upon it, "an accursed land." In a similar manner, Jeremiah says somewhat of Jerusalem (<a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-8.htm">Jeremiah 22:8-9</a>. Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-23.htm">Deuteronomy 29:23-28</a>.) "Many nations shall pass by this city, and they shall say, every man to his neighbor, Wherfore hath the Lord done this unto this great city? Then they shall answer, Because they have forsaken the covenant of the Lord their God, and worshiped other gods and served them."

But there is one point in the vision that is not yet quite clear to him, and he therefore asks for an explanation in <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/4-11.htm">Zechariah 4:11-14</a>. <a href="/zechariah/4-11.htm">Zechariah 4:11</a>. "And I answered and said to him, What are these two olive-trees on the right of the candlestick, and on the left? <a href="/zechariah/4-12.htm">Zechariah 4:12</a>. And I answered the second time, and said to him, What are the two branches (ears) of the olive-trees which are at the hand of the two golden spouts, which pour the gold out of themselves? <a href="/zechariah/4-13.htm">Zechariah 4:13</a>. And he spake to me thus: Knowest thou not what these are? and I said, No, my lord. <a href="/zechariah/4-14.htm">Zechariah 4:14</a>. Then said he, These are the two oil-children, which stand by the Lord of the whole earth." The meaning of the olive-trees on the right and left sides of the candlestick (&#8219;al, over, because the olive-trees rose above the candlestick on the two sides) is not quite obvious to the prophet. He asks about this in <a href="/zechariah/4-11.htm">Zechariah 4:11</a>; at the same time, recognising the fact that their meaning is bound up with the two shibba&#774;le&#772; hazze&#772;th&#305;&#772;m, he does not wait for an answer, but gives greater precision to his question, by asking the meaning of these two branches of the olive-trees. On &#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; the Masora observes, that the dagesh forte conjunct., which is generally found after the interrogative pronoun ma&#770;h, is wanting in the &#1513;&#1473;, and was probably omitted, simply because the &#1513;&#1473; has not a full vowel, but a sheva, whilst the &#1514; which follows has also a dagesh. These branches of the olive-trees were beyad, "at the hand of" (i.e., close by, as in <a href="/job/15-23.htm">Job 15:23</a>) the two golden tsantero&#772;th, which poured the gold from above into the gulla&#770;h of the candlestick. Tsantero&#772;th (&#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;.) is supposed by Aben Ezra and others to stand for oil-presses; but there is no further ground for this than the conjecture that the olive-trees could only supply the candlestick with oil when the olives were pressed. The older translators render the word by spouts or "channels" (lxx &#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3be;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;, Vulg. rostra, Pesh. noses). It is probably related in meaning to tsinno&#772;r, channel or waterfall, and to be derived from tsa&#770;mar, to rush: hence spouts into which the branches of the olive-trees emptied the oil of the olives, so that it poured with a rush out of them into the oil vessel. The latter is obviously implied in the words hammer&#305;&#772;q&#305;&#772;m, etc., which empty out the gold from above themselves, i.e., the gold which comes to them from above. Hazza&#770;ba&#770;bh, the gold which the tsantero&#772;th empty out, is supposed by most commentators to signify the golden-coloured oil. Hofmann (Weiss. u. Erf. i.-344-5) and Kliefoth, on the contrary, understand by it real gold, which flowed out of the spouts into the candlestick, so that the latter was thereby perpetually renewed. But as the candlestick is not now for the first time in process of formation, but is represented in the vision as perfectly finished, and as the gold comes from the branches of the olive-trees, it is impossible to think of anything else than the oil which shines like gold. Accordingly the oil (yitsa&#770;r, lit., shining) is called za&#770;ha&#770;bh, as being, as it were, liquid gold. Hence arises the play upon words: the spouts are of gold, and they pour gold from above themselves into the candlestick (Hitzig and Koehler).<p>The angel having expressed his astonishment at the prophet's ignorance, as he does in <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/4-5.htm">Zechariah 4:5</a>, gives this answer: These (the two bushes of the olive-tree, for which the olive-trees stood there) are the two bene&#772; yitsha&#770;r, sons of oil, i.e., endowed or supplied with oil (cf. <a href="/isaiah/5-1.htm">Isaiah 5:1</a>), which stand by the Lord of the whole earth, namely as His servants (on &#8219;a&#770;mad &#8219;al, denoting the standing posture of a servant, who rises above his master when seated, see <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/22-19.htm">1 Kings 22:19</a>, also <a href="/isaiah/6-2.htm">Isaiah 6:2</a>). The two children of oil cannot be the Jews and Gentiles (Cyril), or Israel and the Gentile world in their fruitful branches, i.e., their believing members (Kliefoth), because the candlestick is the symbol of the church of the Lord, consisting of the believers in Israel and also in the Gentile world. This is just as clear as the distinction between the olive-trees and the candlestick, to which they conduct the oil. Others think of the prophets Haggai and Zechariah (J. D. Mich., Hofm., Baumg., etc.); but although there is no force in Koehler's objection, that in that case there would be a double order of prophets in Israel, since two prophets, both influenced by the Spirit of God, would not imply a double order of prophets, this explanation is decidedly precluded by the fact that two mortal men could not convey to the church for all ages the oil of the Spirit of God. The two sons of oil can only be the two media, anointed with oil, through whom the spiritual and gracious gifts of God were conveyed to the church of the Lord, namely, the existing representatives of the priesthood and the regal government, who were at that time Joshua the high priest and the prince Zerubbabel. These stand by the Lord of the whole earth, as the divinely appointed instruments through whom the Lord causes His Spirit to flow into His congregation. Israel had indeed possessed both these instruments from the time of its first adoption as the people of Jehovah, and both were consecrated to their office by anointing. So far the fact that the olive-trees stand by the side of the candlestick does not appear to indicate anything that the prophet could not have interpreted for himself; and hence the astonishment expressed in the question of the angel in <a href="/zechariah/4-13.htm">Zechariah 4:13</a>. Moreover, the vision was not intended to represent an entirely new order of things, but simply to show the completion of that which was already contained and typified in the old covenant. The seven-armed candlestick was nothing new in itself. All that was new in the candlestick seen by Zechariah was the apparatus through which it was supplied with oil that it might give light, namely, the connection between the candlestick and the two olive-trees, whose branches bore olives like bunches of ears, to supply it abundantly with oil, which was conveyed to each of its seven lamps through seven pipes. The candlestick of the tabernacle had to be supplied every day with the necessary oil by the hands of the priests. This oil the congregation had to present; and to this end the Lord had to bestow His blessing, that the fruits of the land might be made to prosper, so that the olive-tree should bear its olives, and yield a supply of oil. But this blessing was withdrawn from the nation when it fell away from its God (cf. <a href="/joel/1-10.htm">Joel 1:10</a>). If, then, the candlestick had two olive-trees by its side, yielding oil in such copious abundance, that every one of the seven lamps received its supply through seven pipes, it could never fail to have sufficient oil for a full and brilliant light. This was what was new in the visionary candlestick; and the meaning was this, that the Lord would in future bestow upon His congregation the organs of His Spirit, and maintain them in such direct connection with it, that it would be able to let its light shine with sevenfold brilliancy. </body></html>
