And Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead.">2 Kings 19:37</a>, <span class="ital">C’thib</span>) the words <span class="ital">his sons</span> are missing. The only notice of Sennacherib’s death known to us at present from the Inscriptions is simply “Sennacherib king of Assyria his son (sing.) slew him in a revolt.” No name is given to this son. (Schrader, <span class="ital">Keilinschriftliche Bibliothek</span>, vol. 11., p. 281).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - The exact matter corresponding with this one verse is embraced by vers. 35-37 in the parallel (<a href="/2_kings/19.htm">2 Kings 19</a>.). It gives the number of slain as a hundred and eighty-five thousand. It does not speak of the heavy proportion of <span class="cmt_word">leaders and captains</span> lost. It leads us to suppose that for all survivers it was a surprise in the morning - that silent vision of the dead in such vast array. Stating, on the other hand, in mere historic dry detail, the return of Sennacherib to his own land, his dwelling at Nineveh, and assassination, in the house of Nisroch "his god," at the hands of his own two sons, mentioned by name Adrammelech and Sharezer, who had to fly for it to Armenia (<span class="accented">Ararat</span>), it does not show the obviously designed moral touch of our compiler, <span class="cmt_word">so he returned with shame of face to his own</span> <span class="cmt_word">land,</span> nor the similarly complexioned description of the time, place, and agents of his assassination. Lastly, it gives Esarhaddon as the name of his successor on the throne. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_chronicles/32.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The description of Sennacherib's all-conquering power: cf. <a href="/2_kings/18-35.htm">2 Kings 18:35</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/36-20.htm">Isaiah 36:20</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/37-11.htm">Isaiah 37:11-13</a>. "Who is there among all the gods of these peoples, whom my fathers utterly destroyed, who could have delivered his people out of my hand, that your God should save you?" The idea is, that since the gods of the other peoples, which were mightier than your God, have not been able to save their peoples, how should your God be in a position to rescue you from my power? This idea is again repeated in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-15.htm">2 Chronicles 32:15</a>, as a foundation for the exhortation not to let themselves be deceived and misled by Hezekiah, and not to believe his words, and that in an assertative form: "for not one god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people, ... much less then (&#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1488;&#1507;) your gods: they will not save you;" and this is done in order to emphasize strongly the blasphemy of the Assyrian generals against the Almighty God of Israel. To communicate more of these blasphemous speeches would in the chronicler's view be useless, and he therefore only remarks, in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-16.htm">2 Chronicles 32:16</a>, "And yet more spake his (Sennacherib's) servants against God Jahve, and against His servant Hezekiah;" and then, in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-17.htm">2 Chronicles 32:17</a>, that Sennacherib also wrote a letter of similar purport, and (<a href="/2_chronicles/32-18.htm">2 Chronicles 32:18</a>) that his servants called with a loud voice in the Jews' speech to the people of Jerusalem upon the wall, to throw them into fear and terrify them, that they might take the city. What they called to the people is not stated, but by the infinit. &#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1489;&#1492;&#1500;&#1501; &#1500;&#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1501; it is hinted, and thence we may gather that it was to the same effect as the blasphemous speeches above quoted (&#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1501;, inf. Pi., as in <a href="/nehemiah/6-19.htm">Nehemiah 6:19</a>). - On comparing <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/18.htm">2 Kings 18</a> and 19, it is clear that Sennacherib only sent the letter to Hezekiah after his general Rabshakeh had informed him of the fruitlessness of his efforts to induce the people of Jerusalem to submit by speeches, and the news of the advance of the Cushite king Tirhakah had arrived; while the calling aloud in the Jews' language to the people standing on the wall, on the part of his generals, took place in the first negotiation with the ambassadors of Hezekiah. The author of the Chronicle has arranged his narrative rhetorically, so as to make the various events form a climax: first, the speeches of the servants of Sennacherib; then the king's letter to Hezekiah to induce him and his counsellors to submit; and finally, the attempt to terrify the people in language intelligible to them. The conclusion is the statement, <a href="/2_chronicles/32-19.htm">2 Chronicles 32:19</a> : "They spake of the God of Jerusalem as of the gods of the peoples of the earth, the work of the hands of man;" cf. <a href="/2_kings/19-18.htm">2 Kings 19:18</a>. </body></html>
