The polluting or filling up of wells, and the altering of the course of rivers, is an old practice that still obtains in the wars of the East. Hezekiah's plan was to cover the fountain heads, so that they might not be discovered by the enemy, and to carry the water by subterranean channels or pipes into the city&#8212;a plan which, while it would secure a constant supply to the inhabitants, would distress the besiegers, as the country all around Jerusalem was very destitute of water.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/32.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">To stop the waters of the fountains, </span> with earth or other things cast into them; and withal to derive the waters by secret paths and pipes under ground to Jerusalem. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_chronicles/32.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>He took counsel with his princes, and his mighty men,....

It is rudely constructed and owing to its windings is 586 yards long, though the distance in a straight line is only 368 yards. As therefore the Lower Pool was probably within the ancient walls, while St Mary’s Well was outside, this tunnel may be Hezekiah’s conduit. If the well were stopped, the besiegers would lose the water, which would collect in the Pool for the use of the besieged. An inscription in ancient Hebrew characters (“The Siloam Inscription”) discovered <span class="ital">in situ</span> describes briefly the digging of the tunnel, but does not enable us to fix the date of it for certain. See for the original text Lidzbarski, <span class="ital">Nordsemitische Epigraphik</span>, Tafel xxi. 1, and for an English translation, Sayce, <span class="ital">Fresh Light from the Ancient Monuments</span>, p. 87.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To stop the waters of the fountains... without the city</span>. These fountains or springs were probably those represented by <span class="accented">En Rogel</span>, on the <span class="accented">Ophel spur</span> or very large mound, or fortified hill (mistranslated possibly from that circumstance "tower," in <a href="/2_kings/5-24.htm">2 Kings 5:24</a>; <a href="/isaiah/32-14.htm">Isaiah 32:14</a>), on the southeast of the temple. The object of Hezekiah is obvious enough. The word (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span>) for "stopping" occurs in all thirteen times - twice in piel in Genesis, once in niph. in Nehemiah, and ten times in kal in Kings, Chronicles, Daniel, Ezekiel, and Psalms. It is for all material purposes very uniformly rendered in all these places by the word "stop" eight times, and otherwise "shut" or "closed," or to carry a derived meaning, "hidden" or "secret." If the word "shut" or "shut off" were employed, it would fit every occasion. So we are not told here how he stopped the fountain or fountains, but that he shut the waters off from one direction and guided them into another, vie. by a conduit running <span class="accented">westward</span> from the springs and the Gihon (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the brook) flowing naturally down the Tyropoean valley to a pool prepared for it in the city (see our ver. 30; and <a href="/2_kings/18-17.htm">2 Kings 18:17</a>; <a href="/2_kings/20-20.htm">2 Kings 20:20</a>; Ecclus, 48:17; and Conder's 'Handbook to the Bible,' p. 339). This pool was very probably none other than the pool of Siloam. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_chronicles/31.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The connection and interpretation of this verse is doubtful. If we take &#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1495;&#1514;&#1497;&#1495;&#1513;&#1474; as a continuation of &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492;&#1514;&#1497;&#1492;&#1513;&#1473;, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-17.htm">2 Chronicles 31:17</a>, it gives us no suitable sense. The addition, "and also to every priest and Levite was a larger or smaller portion given according to the catalogue" (Ramb., etc.), is arbitrary, and does not fully express the &#1489;&#1468; before &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1496;&#1508;&#1468;&#1501;. Berth., on the other hand, correctly remarks, "After the parentheses in <a href="/2_chronicles/31-16.htm">2 Chronicles 31:16</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-17.htm">2 Chronicles 31:17</a>, &#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1495;&#1514;&#1497;&#1495;&#1513;&#1474; may be taken as a continuation of &#1500;&#1514;&#1514; in <a href="/2_chronicles/31-16.htm">2 Chronicles 31:16</a>;" but the word itself he translates wrongly thus: The men were in the priests' cities, also to register their children, etc., disregarding the construction of &#1492;&#1514;&#1497;&#1495;&#1513;&#1474; with &#1489;&#1468;. - From <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-19.htm">2 Chronicles 31:19</a>, where the same construction recurs, we learn how to interpret &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1496; &#1492;&#1514;&#1497;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;: the catalogue  equals  those registered in (of) all their children. According to this view, &#1493;&#1500;&#1492;&#1514;&#1497;&#1495;&#1513;&#1474; corresponds to the &#1500;&#1488;&#1495;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;, <a href="/2_chronicles/31-15.htm">2 Chronicles 31:15</a> : to give to their brethren, ... and to the registered of all their children, their wives, and their sons and daughters, viz., to the whole multitude (sc., of the wives, sons, and daughters), i.e., as many of them as there were. This interpretation of the &#1500;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1511;&#1492;&#1500; seems simpler than with Schmidt and Ramb. to understand &#1511;&#1492;&#1500; to denote the coroporation of priests. There was therefore no one forgotten or overlooked; "for according to their fidelity (<a href="/2_chronicles/31-15.htm">2 Chronicles 31:15</a>) did they show themselves holy in regard to the holy," i.e., they acted in a holy manner with the holy gifts, distributed them disinterestedly and impartially to all who had any claim to them.</body></html>
