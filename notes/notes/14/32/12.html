These negotiations are passed over, not only in our narrative, but also in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/36.htm">Isaiah 36</a>, because they had no influence upon the after course and the issue of the war. Sennacherib was not induced to withdraw by the payment of the sum demanded, and soon after the receipt of it he sent a detachment from Lachish against Jerusalem, to summon the city to surrender. The fortification of Jerusalem which the Chronicle records began before these negotiations, and was continued while they were in progress. </body></html>
