Gentleness will do what violence will not do. Most people like to be accosted mildly. Good words cost only a little self-denial, yet they purchase great things. No more needs to be done to ruin men, than to leave them to their own pride and passion. Thus, whatever are the devices of men, God is doing his own work by all, and fulfilling the word which he has spoken. No man can bequeath his prosperity to his heirs any more than his wisdom; though our children will generally be affected by our conduct, whether good or bad. Let us then seek those good things which will be our own for ever; and crave the blessing of God upon our posterity, in preference to wealth or worldly exaltation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The narrative of Kings (marginal reference) is repeated with only slight verbal differences. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15-17. the king hearkened not unto the people, for the cause was of God&#8212;Rehoboam, in following an evil counsel, and the Hebrew people, in making a revolutionary movement, each acted as free agents, obeying their own will and passions. But God, who permitted the revolt of the northern tribes, intended it as a punishment of the house of David for Solomon's apostasy. That event demonstrates the immediate superintendence of His providence over the revolutions of kingdoms; and thus it affords an instance, similar to many other striking instances that are found in Scripture, of divine predictions, uttered long before, being accomplished by the operation of human passions, and in the natural course of events.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_chronicles/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>See Introduction to Chapter 9 <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_chronicles/10.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram that was over the tribute; and the children of Israel stoned him with stones, that he died.

Rehoboam must be supposed to have sent Hadoram either to make some "tribute" summons, or try some arrangement respecting it, or respecting conciliatory steps. The reception he met warns Rehoboam to make the quickest escape possible, and no doubt opens his eyes fully to what he has done. It was the remanet of his delusive self-confidence to send this collector of taxes to those who had begged some remission of taxation. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_chronicles/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>This event is narrated in our chapter, except in so far as a few unessential differences in form are concerned, exactly as we have it in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/12-1.htm">1 Kings 12:1-19</a>; so that we may refer for the exposition of it to the commentary on <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/12.htm">1 Kings 12</a>, where we have both treated the contents of this chapter, and have also discussed the deeper and more latent causes of this event, so important in its consequences. </body></html>
