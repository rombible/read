Gentleness will do what violence will not do. Most people like to be accosted mildly. Good words cost only a little self-denial, yet they purchase great things. No more needs to be done to ruin men, than to leave them to their own pride and passion. Thus, whatever are the devices of men, God is doing his own work by all, and fulfilling the word which he has spoken. No man can bequeath his prosperity to his heirs any more than his wisdom; though our children will generally be affected by our conduct, whether good or bad. Let us then seek those good things which will be our own for ever; and crave the blessing of God upon our posterity, in preference to wealth or worldly exaltation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The narrative of Kings (marginal reference) is repeated with only slight verbal differences. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15-17. the king hearkened not unto the people, for the cause was of God&#8212;Rehoboam, in following an evil counsel, and the Hebrew people, in making a revolutionary movement, each acted as free agents, obeying their own will and passions. But God, who permitted the revolt of the northern tribes, intended it as a punishment of the house of David for Solomon's apostasy. That event demonstrates the immediate superintendence of His providence over the revolutions of kingdoms; and thus it affords an instance, similar to many other striking instances that are found in Scripture, of divine predictions, uttered long before, being accomplished by the operation of human passions, and in the natural course of events.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_chronicles/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>See Introduction to Chapter 9 <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_chronicles/10.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But as for the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - To the tribe of Judah the family of David belonged.

God said that this tribe and (as is abundantly evident from Ahijah's forcibly dramatic parable of the rent garment) Benjamin also should be saved to Rehoboam and for ever to David's line, and again it is evident that he works in the midst of human event, and moral cause and effect. Israel would not have revolted but that Jeroboam was of Ephraim, and Judah would not have remained steadfast but that, with other determining influences also, to Judah belonged Rehoboam and Solomon and David. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_chronicles/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>This event is narrated in our chapter, except in so far as a few unessential differences in form are concerned, exactly as we have it in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/12-1.htm">1 Kings 12:1-19</a>; so that we may refer for the exposition of it to the commentary on <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/12.htm">1 Kings 12</a>, where we have both treated the contents of this chapter, and have also discussed the deeper and more latent causes of this event, so important in its consequences. </body></html>
