Gentleness will do what violence will not do. Most people like to be accosted mildly. Good words cost only a little self-denial, yet they purchase great things. No more needs to be done to ruin men, than to leave them to their own pride and passion. Thus, whatever are the devices of men, God is doing his own work by all, and fulfilling the word which he has spoken. No man can bequeath his prosperity to his heirs any more than his wisdom; though our children will generally be affected by our conduct, whether good or bad.

According to the modern phrase, he was just ripe to have known and bethought himself of this. But all rashly Rehoboam casts the die. The sound judgment, real knowledge, opportune and practical advice of the "old men," uttered evidently off so kind a tongue, should have been indeed now "as good as an inheritance; yea, better too" (<a href="/ecclesiastes/7-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:11</a>, margin). The reading of the parallel is well worthy to be noted (<a href="/1_kings/11-7.htm">1 Kings 11:7</a>), with its manifestly pleasantly and skilfully worded antithesis, "If <span class="accented">thou this day</span> will be a servant to this people...  then <span class="accented">they</span> will be thy servants <span class="accented">for ever."</span> Our words, however, have their own exquisite beauty about them, <span class="cmt_word">If thou wilt be kind to this</span> <span class="cmt_word">people, and please them, and speak good words to them.</span> One might fancy that Saul, and David, and Solomon, and angels themselves bended over the scene, and looked and listened and longed for wisdom and love and right to prevail. <span class="cmt_word">The young men that had grown up with him</span>. While this expression throws light as above on that which speaks of Rehoboam's <span class="cmt_word">old men</span> counsellors, it wakens the question how men of forty-one years of age can be called "young," as Rehoboam was not living in patriarchal aged times. And the question is emphasized by the language applied to Rehoboam in <a href="/2_chronicles/13-7.htm">2 Chronicles 13:7</a>, where he is described as "young and tenderhearted," and unable, for want of strength of character and of knowledge, to "withstand vain men" (as he surely shows too clearly now). It has been suggested ('Speaker's Commentary,' 2:562, Note C) that <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5d0;</span> (21) should be read for <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d0;</span> (41) in the two passages quoted above (<a href="/1_kings/14-21.htm">1 Kings 14:21</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/12-13.htm">2 Chronicles 12:13</a>).
