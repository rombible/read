Gentleness will do what violence will not do. Most people like to be accosted mildly. Good words cost only a little self-denial, yet they purchase great things. No more needs to be done to ruin men, than to leave them to their own pride and passion. Thus, whatever are the devices of men, God is doing his own work by all, and fulfilling the word which he has spoken. No man can bequeath his prosperity to his heirs any more than his wisdom; though our children will generally be affected by our conduct, whether good or bad. Let us then seek those good things which will be our own for ever; and crave the blessing of God upon our posterity, in preference to wealth or worldly exaltation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The narrative of Kings (marginal reference) is repeated with only slight verbal differences. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15-17. the king hearkened not unto the people, for the cause was of God&#8212;Rehoboam, in following an evil counsel, and the Hebrew people, in making a revolutionary movement, each acted as free agents, obeying their own will and passions. But God, who permitted the revolt of the northern tribes, intended it as a punishment of the house of David for Solomon's apostasy. That event demonstrates the immediate superintendence of His providence over the revolutions of kingdoms; and thus it affords an instance, similar to many other striking instances that are found in Scripture, of divine predictions, uttered long before, being accomplished by the operation of human passions, and in the natural course of events.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_chronicles/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>See Introduction to Chapter 9 <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_chronicles/10.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">So the king hearkened not unto the people: for the <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> cause was of God, that the LORD might perform his word, which he spake by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.</span><p>(e) God's will overrides all so that nothing can be done but according to the same, and yet man's will works by itself, so that he cannot use the excuse that his deed was of God's ordinance.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/2_chronicles/10.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">15</span>. <span class="ital">the cause was of God</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">it was brought about of God</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">might perform</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">might establish</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Ahijah</span>] Cp. <a href="/context/1_kings/11-29.htm" title="And it came to pass at that time when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way; and he had clad himself with a new garment; and they two were alone in the field:...">1 Kings 11:29-39</a>.

The Divine word foretold, as the Divine mind foreknew, the inevitable course of the stream, that took its source in and from Solomon's faithless heart and life. Solomon "being dead yet" bears his full share of the responsibility of what Rehoboam was, and shortly came to <span class="accented">show</span> he was.

Let but that <span class="accented">result</span> appear, which God has with his sure and abiding Word declared, and the practical attitude and language of Scripture are that it is vain to fight against it; for the thing is of God. It was known of him and said of him. And it carries its punishment or its recompense in it, as of him. It will be noticed, again, how our compiler refers to the incident of Ahijah, as though he had recorded it, which he had not done. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_chronicles/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>This event is narrated in our chapter, except in so far as a few unessential differences in form are concerned, exactly as we have it in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/12-1.htm">1 Kings 12:1-19</a>; so that we may refer for the exposition of it to the commentary on <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/12.htm">1 Kings 12</a>, where we have both treated the contents of this chapter, and have also discussed the deeper and more latent causes of this event, so important in its consequences. </body></html>
