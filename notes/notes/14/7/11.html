The mercies of God to sinners are made known in a manner well suited to impress all who receive them, with his majesty and holiness. The people worshipped and praised God. When he manifests himself as a consuming Fire to sinners, his people can rejoice in him as their Light. Nay, they had reason to say, that God was good in this. It is of the Lord's mercies we are not consumed, but the sacrifice in our stead, for which we should be very thankful. And whoever beholds with true faith, the Saviour agonizing and dying for man's sin, will, by that view, find his godly sorrow enlarged, his hatred of sin increased, his soul made more watchful, and his life more holy. Solomon prosperously effected all he designed, for adorning both God's house and his own. Those who begin with the service of God, are likely to go on successfully in their own affairs. It was Solomon's praise, that what he undertook, he went through with; it was by the grace of God that he prospered in it. Let us then stand in awe, and sin not. Let us fear the Lord's displeasure, hope in his mercy, and walk in his commandments.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The narrative now runs parallel with <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/9-1.htm">1 Kings 9:1-9</a>, but is more full, and presents less of verbal agreement. <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-13.htm">2 Chronicles 7:13-15</a> are additional to the earlier record. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month&#8212;This was the last day of the feast of tabernacles.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_chronicles/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Thus Solomon finished the house of the Lord,....

The expressions that we have in this verse guide us amid some ambiguities to the correct date of the consecration of the temple. The verse purports to speak of the final completion the temple and the king's house or palace, with all whatsoever that was necessary to them in the matter of their furnishing. And, to say the least, the impression naturally produced on the reader is that they are spoken of as being <span class="accented">thus</span> completed simultaneously, although, beyond doubt, there was a sense in which the temple was (not utterly finished but) built long before the palace. Accordingly, when the next verse tells us of God's answer vouchsafed to the dedication prayer of Solomon, we <span class="cmt_word">are</span> not driven to the supposition that several years had elapsed since the final completion of the temple and the dedication of it on the one hand, nor, on the other hand, a similar interval lost between the dedication prayer and the Divine acknowledgment of it. It may be again stated that the main structure of the temple (not including courts, pillars, furnishing, vessels, etc.) was built after seven years' process, in the eleventh year of Solomon's reign, but the palace only after another complete twelve years (<a href="/1_kings/7-1.htm">1 Kings 7:1</a>), in Solomon's twenty-fourth year. A liberal study of the parallel narrative of Kings in its entirety strengthens considerably this view, inasmuch as there the whole account of the palace-building finds its place previous to the account of the dedicating of the temple. However, though there can be little practical doubt as to how the facts of the case stood and stand, yet this occasion must count one to be added to the chronological memorabilia of Scripture, in that, while both the accounts to which we have access leave very vague the very things we should naturally expect to have been stated concisely, they also both seem entirely unconscious of it - a directest outcome of the fact that both writers were but picking their own way in the midst of borrowed material, neither of them the original historian. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_chronicles/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The sacrifices and the festival. After fire from heaven had devoured the sacrifices, and Solomon had praised the Lord for the fulfilment of His word, and sought for the congregation the further bestowal of the divine blessing (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/8-54.htm">1 Kings 8:54-61</a>), the dedication of the temple was concluded by a great thank-offering, of which we have in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-5.htm">2 Chronicles 7:5</a>, <a href="/2_chronicles/7-6.htm">2 Chronicles 7:6</a> an account which completely agrees with <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/8-62.htm">1 Kings 8:62-63</a>. - In <a href="/2_chronicles/7-6.htm">2 Chronicles 7:6</a> the author of the Chr. again makes express mention of the singing and playing of the Levites when these offerings were presented. In the performance of this sacrificial act the priests stood &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501;, in their stations; but that does not signify separated according to their divisions (Berth.), but in officiis suis (Vulg.), i.e., ordines suos et functiones suas a Davide <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2.htm">1 Chronicles 2</a> Chronicles <a href="/1_chronicles/24-7.htm">1 Chronicles 24:7</a>. institutas servarunt (Ramb.); see on <a href="/numbers/8-26.htm">Numbers 8:26</a>.

This clause seems to be added to the relative clause, "which king David had made," for nearer definition, and to signify that the Levites used the same instruments which David had introduced when he praised God by the playing of the Levites. The form &#1502;&#1495;&#1510;&#1510;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; as in <a href="/1_chronicles/15-24.htm">1 Chronicles 15:24</a>.</body></html>
