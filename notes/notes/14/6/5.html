First and chiefly, he prays for repentance and forgiveness, which is the chief blessing, and the only solid foundation of other mercies: he then prays for temporal mercies; thereby teaching us what things to mind and desire most in our prayers. This also Christ hath taught us in his perfect pattern and form of prayer, where there is but one prayer for outward, and all the rest are for spiritual blessings. The temple typified the human nature of Christ, in whom dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily. The ark typified his obedience and sufferings, by which repenting sinners have access to a reconciled God, and communion with him. Jehovah has made our nature his resting-place for ever, in the person of Emmanuel, and through him he dwells with, and delights in his church of redeemed sinners. May our hearts become his resting-place; may Christ dwell therein by faith, consecrating them as his temples, and shedding abroad his love therein. May the Father look upon us in and through his Anointed; and may he remember and bless us in all things, according to his mercy to sinners, in and through Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Compare Kings (marginal references).<p>Compare Kings (marginal references). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 6<p>2Ch 6:1-41.

The Lord hath said that he would dwell in the thick darkness&#8212;This introduction to Solomon's address was evidently suggested by the remarkable incident recorded at the close of the last chapter: the phenomenon of a densely opaque and uniformly shaped cloud, descending in a slow and majestic manner and filling the whole area of the temple. He regarded it himself, and directed the people also to regard it, as an undoubted sign and welcome pledge of the divine presence and acceptance of the building reared to His honor and worship. He referred not to any particular declaration of God, but to the cloud having been all along in the national history of Israel the recognized symbol of the divine presence (Ex 16:10; 24:16; 40:34; Nu 9:15; 1Ki 8:10, 11).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_chronicles/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>See Introduction to Chapter 5 <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_chronicles/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Since the day that I brought forth my people out of the land of Egypt I chose no city among all the tribes of Israel to build an house in, that my name might be there; neither chose I any man to be a ruler over my people Israel:</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/2_chronicles/6.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5</span>. <span class="ital">neither chose I any man to be a ruler over my people Israel</span>] The Chronicler regards Saul as rejected rather than chosen; <a href="/context/1_chronicles/10-13.htm" title="So Saul died for his transgression which he committed against the LORD, even against the word of the LORD, which he kept not, and also for asking counsel of one that had a familiar spirit, to inquire of it;...">1 Chronicles 10:13-14</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I chose no city,...</span>  neither chose I any man.

The meaning is: and the trumpeters and singers, together as one man, sang with one voice to praise. &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1495;&#1491; is placed first for emphasis; stress is laid upon the subject, the trumpeters and singers, by the introductory &#1500;; and &#1492;&#1497;&#1492; is construed with the following infinitive (&#1500;&#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1506;): it was to sound, to cause to hear, for they were causing to hear, where &#1500; c. infin. is connected with &#1492;&#1497;&#1492;, as the participle is elsewhere, to describe the circumstances; cf. Ew. 237. But in order to express very strongly the idea of the unisono of the trumpet-sound, and the singing accompanied by the harp-playing, which lies in &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1495;&#1491;, &#1488;&#1495;&#1491; &#1511;&#1493;&#1500; is added to &#1500;&#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1506;. By &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1511;&#1493;&#1500; &#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; all that was to be said of the song and music is drawn together in the form of a protasis, to which is joined &#1502;&#1500;&#1488; &#1493;&#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;, the apodosis both of this latter and also of the protasis which was interrupted by the parenthesis in <a href="/2_chronicles/5-11.htm">2 Chronicles 5:11</a> : "When the priests went forth from the holy place, for...(<a href="/2_chronicles/5-11.htm">2 Chronicles 5:11</a>), and when they lifted up the voice with trumpets and with cymbals, and the (other) instruments of song, and with the praise of Jahve, that He is good, that His mercy endureth for ever (cf. <a href="/1_chronicles/16-34.htm">1 Chronicles 16:34</a>), then was the house filled with the cloud of the house of Jahve." The absence of the article before &#1506;&#1504;&#1503; requires us thus to connect the &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; at the close of the verse with &#1506;&#1504;&#1503; (stat. constr.), since the indefinite &#1506;&#1504;&#1503; (without the article) is not at all suitable here; for it is not any cloud which is here spoken of, but that which overshadowed the glory of the Lord in the most holy place. </body></html>
