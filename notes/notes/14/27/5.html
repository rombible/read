Perhaps Jotham was wanting towards the reformation of the land. Men may be very good, and yet not have courage and zeal to do what they might. It certainly casts blame upon the people. Jotham prospered, and became mighty. The more stedfast we are in religion, the more mighty we are, both to resist evil, and to do good. The Lord often removes wise and pious rulers, and sends others, whose follies and vices punish a people that valued not their mercies.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Ammonites, who had submitted to Uzziah <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-8.htm">2 Chronicles 26:8</a>, revolted against Jotham. This revolt he firmly repressed; and, to punish it, he exacted a high rate of tribute for the three years following the termination of the war. The productiveness of the Ammonite country in grain, which is here indicated, has been remarked upon as extraordinary by modern travelers. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/27.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2Ch 27:5-9.

But when Rezin, king of Syria, and Pekah, king of Israel, combined to attack the kingdom of Judah, they took the opportunity of revolting, and Jotham was too distracted by other matters to attempt the reconquest (see on [458]2Ki 15:37).   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/27.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The king of the Ammonites, </span> it seems, endeavoured to shake off the yoke which from David’s time had been put upon them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_chronicles/27.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>He fought also with the king of the Ammonites, and prevailed against them,....

No allusion is made to the matter of this verse in the parallel, which contains a statement of the Syrian Rezin's attack or threatened invasion of Judah; as well as Pekah's, son of Remaliah King of Israel. Of the Ammonites' defeat by Uzziah we have just heard (foregoing chapter, ver. 8). A general statement is all that is made there of the gifts or tribute, they then had to pay. The present tribute was a heavy payment, and enforced for three, years. The "wheat" and "barley," in which payment was largely made bespeak the fertile arable quality of the Ammonite land, and this is noticed by travellers to the present day. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_chronicles/26.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The history of his reign was written by the prophet Isaiah (see the Introduction). </body></html>
