Perhaps Jotham was wanting towards the reformation of the land. Men may be very good, and yet not have courage and zeal to do what they might. It certainly casts blame upon the people. Jotham prospered, and became mighty. The more stedfast we are in religion, the more mighty we are, both to resist evil, and to do good.

When the priests saw the leprosy, they removed the king immediately from the holy place; and Uzziah himself also hurried to go forth, because Jahve had smitten him; for he recognised in the sudden breaking out of the leprosy a punishment from God. Azariah is called &#1492;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; &#1499;&#1468;&#1492;&#1503;, i.e., a high priest, and is in all probability the same person as the high priest mentioned in <a href="/1_chronicles/6-10.htm">1 Chronicles 6:10</a> (see on the passage). &#1500;&#1499;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491; &#1500;&#1498; &#1500;&#1488;, "It (the offering of incense) is not for thine honour before Jahve." &#1494;&#1506;&#1507;, to foam up in anger. &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1494;&#1506;&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;, and while he foamed against the priests, i.e., was hot against them, the leprosy had broken out. &#1502;&#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1494;&#1489;&#1468;&#1495;, from by  equals  near, the altar. Thus was Uzziah visited with the same punishment, for his haughty disregard of the divinely appointed privileges of the priesthood, as was once inflicted upon Miriam for her rebellion against the prerogatives assigned to Moses by God (<a href="/numbers/12-10.htm">Numbers 12:10</a>).</body></html>
