Abundant riches and honour give large opportunities of doing good, but they are attended with many snares and temptations. Men do not know much of the artifices of Satan and the deceitfulness of their own hearts, when they covet riches with the idea of being able to do good with them. What can hurt those whom God will protect? What can shelter those whom God will destroy? Jehoshaphat is safe in his robes, Ahab killed in his armour; for the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong. We should be cautious of entangling ourselves in the worldly undertakings of evil men; and still more we should avoid engaging in their sinful projects. But, when they call upon him, God can and will bring his faithful people out of the difficulties and dangers into which they have sinfully run themselves. He has all hearts in his hand, so that he easily rescues them.

In lieu of the italic type "<span class="accented">certain"</span> here, the English idiom, "years after," would aptly reproduce the facts of the case. This journey to Samaria to see Ahab was made in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat's reign (<a href="/1_kings/22-51.htm">1 Kings 22:51</a>; comp. <a href="/2_chronicles/20-35.htm">2 Chronicles 20:35</a> and <a href="/2_kings/3-1.htm">2 Kings 3:1</a>). What were the precise antecedent circumstances of this visit of Jehoshaphat to Ahab it is interesting to surmise - whether it were the fruit of an invitation direct from Ahab, who had his own designs, or whether it were for diplomatic reasons, that worked in the mind of Jehoshaphat as well as of Ahab, in view of Syria. It is evident that Ahab promptly determined to improve this conference of kings. <span class="cmt_word">Persuaded him</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he took steps to induce him. This is the uniform signification of the word here used in the eighteen times of its occurrence, and mostly in doubtful, or worse than doubtful, matter. The form is the hiph. of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5ea;</span>, in which conjugation only the verb occurs. The Revised Version renders "moved." The visiting and cooperating of Jehoshaphat and Ahab made a novel departure in the history of the rended kingdoms of Judah and Israel, and continued till the time of Jehu. <span class="cmt_word">Ramoth-Gilead</span>. This important city of Gad (<a href="/joshua/20-8.htm">Joshua 20:8</a>; <a href="/joshua/21-38.htm">Joshua 21:38</a>), in Palestine beyond Jordan, comes into question as one not surrendered to the king-dora of Israel in good faith, according to the promise of Benhadad (<a href="/1_kings/20-34.htm">1 Kings 20:34</a>; comp. 1, 4, 7, 11, 20, 30, 33), Benhadad's father having taken it from Omri, father of Ahab. For "all the might that he showed," and presumably in conflicts with Syria, Omri was evidently a heavy loser. <span class="accented">Ramoth-Gilead</span> means "the heights of Gilead." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_chronicles/17.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The men fit for war passed in review according to their fathers'-houses.
