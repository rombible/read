Those only prosper whom God makes to prosper; for prosperity is his gift. Many have owned, that as long as they sought the Lord, and kept close to their duty, they prospered; but when they forsook God, every thing went cross. God never continues either to bless the indolent or to withhold his blessing from the diligent. He will never suffer any to seek his face in vain. Uzziah's name was famed throughout all the neighbouring countries. A name with God and good people makes truly honourable. He did not delight in war, nor addict himself to sports, but delighted in husbandry.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Uzziah - This form of the name is found uniformly in Chronicles (except <a href="/1_chronicles/3-12.htm">1 Chronicles 3:12</a>) and in the prophets.

He built Eloth&#8212;or, "He it was who built Eloth." The account of the fortifications of this port on the Red Sea, which Uzziah restored to the kingdom of Judah (2Ch 33:13), is placed before the chronological notices (2Ch 26:3), either on account of the importance attached to the conquest of Eloth, or from the desire of the historian to introduce Uzziah as the king, who was known as the conqueror of Eloth. Besides, it indicates that the conquest occurred in the early part of his reign, that it was important as a port, and that Hebrew merchants maintained the old trade between it and the countries of the East [Bertheau].<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/26.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_chronicles/26.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then all the people of Judah took Uzziah,....

The word is probably of foreign origin, and such words are seldom of fixed form when adopted into common language; cp. the various forms of “Damascus” (<a href="/1_chronicles/18-5.htm" title="And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadarezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.">1 Chronicles 18:5</a>, note).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">after that the king</span>, etc.] We conjecture that this phrase means that it was after king Amaziah slept with his fathers that Uzziah his son restored Elath to Judah. If this be right, we must suppose that Uzziah reigned in Jerusalem for some time, while his father was in refuge at Lachish. Some years of history may be crowded into <a href="/2_chronicles/25-27.htm" title="Now after the time that Amaziah did turn away from following the LORD they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem; and he fled to Lachish: but they sent to Lachish after him, and slew him there.">2 Chronicles 25:27</a>.
