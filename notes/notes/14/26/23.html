But his transgression was, going into the holy place, and attempting to burn incense upon the altar of God. See how hard it is to avoid one extreme, and not run into another. Pride of heart was at the bottom of his sin; a lust that ruins many. Instead of lifting up the name God in gratitude to him who had done so much for him, his heart was lifted up to his hurt. Men's pretending to forbidden knowledge, and seeking things too high for them, are owing to pride of heart. The incense of our prayers must be, by faith, put into the hands of our Lord Jesus, the great High Priest of our profession, else we cannot expect it to be accepted by God, Re 8:3. Though Uzziah strove with the priests, he would not strive with his Maker. But he was punished for his transgression; he continued a leper to his death, shut out from society. The punishment answered the sin as face to face in a glass. Pride was at the bottom of his transgression, and thus God humbled him, and put dishonour upon him. Those that covet forbidden honours, forfeit allowed ones. Adam, by catching at the tree of knowledge which he might not eat of, debarred himself of the tree of life which he might have eaten of. Let all that read say, The Lord is righteous. And when the Lord sees good to throw prosperous and useful men aside, as broken vessels, if he raises up others to fill their places, they may rejoice to renounce all worldly concerns, and employ their remaining days in preparation for death.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In the field of the burial - i. e. in the same piece of ground, but in a separate sepulchre.

When the priests saw the leprosy, they removed the king immediately from the holy place; and Uzziah himself also hurried to go forth, because Jahve had smitten him; for he recognised in the sudden breaking out of the leprosy a punishment from God. Azariah is called &#1492;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; &#1499;&#1468;&#1492;&#1503;, i.e., a high priest, and is in all probability the same person as the high priest mentioned in <a href="/1_chronicles/6-10.htm">1 Chronicles 6:10</a> (see on the passage). &#1500;&#1499;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491; &#1500;&#1498; &#1500;&#1488;, "It (the offering of incense) is not for thine honour before Jahve." &#1494;&#1506;&#1507;, to foam up in anger. &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1494;&#1506;&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;, and while he foamed against the priests, i.e., was hot against them, the leprosy had broken out. &#1502;&#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1494;&#1489;&#1468;&#1495;, from by  equals  near, the altar. Thus was Uzziah visited with the same punishment, for his haughty disregard of the divinely appointed privileges of the priesthood, as was once inflicted upon Miriam for her rebellion against the prerogatives assigned to Moses by God (<a href="/numbers/12-10.htm">Numbers 12:10</a>).</body></html>
