Those only prosper whom God makes to prosper; for prosperity is his gift. Many have owned, that as long as they sought the Lord, and kept close to their duty, they prospered; but when they forsook God, every thing went cross. God never continues either to bless the indolent or to withhold his blessing from the diligent. He will never suffer any to seek his face in vain. Uzziah's name was famed throughout all the neighbouring countries. A name with God and good people makes truly honourable.

Uzziah (&#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;) is called in <a href="/1_chronicles/3-12.htm">1 Chronicles 3:12</a> and in 2 Kings generally) Azariah (&#1506;&#1494;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492;); cf. on the use of the two names, the commentary on <a href="/2_kings/14-21.htm">2 Kings 14:21</a>. - In <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-5.htm">2 Chronicles 26:5</a>, instead of the standing formula, "only the high places were not removed," etc.) Kings), Uzziah's attitude towards the Lord is more exactly defined thus: "He was seeking God in the days of Zechariah, who instructed him in the fear of God; and in the days when he sought Jahve, God gave him success." In &#1500;&#1491;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; &#1493;&#1497;&#1492;&#1497; the infinitive with &#1500; is subordinated to &#1492;&#1497;&#1492;, to express the duration of his seeking, for which the participle is elsewhere used. Nothing further is known of the Zechariah here mentioned: the commentators hold him to have been an important prophet; for had he been a priest, or the high priest, probably &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;&#1503; would have been used. The reading &#1492;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; (Keth.) is surprising. &#1492; &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1503; &#1489; can only denote, who had insight into (or understanding for the) seeing of God; cf. <a href="/daniel/1-17.htm">Daniel 1:17</a>. But Kimchi's idea, which other old commentators share, that this is a periphrasis to denote the prophetic endowment or activity of the man, is opposed by this, that "the seeing of God" which was granted to the elders of Israel at the making of the covenant, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/24-10.htm">Exodus 24:10</a>, cannot be regarded as a thing within the sphere of human action or practice, while the prophetic beholding in vision is essentially different from the seeing of God, and is, moreover, never so called. &#1489;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; would therefore seem to be an orthographical error for &#1489;&#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1514;, some MSS having &#1489;&#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; or &#1489;&#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1514; (cf. de Rossi, variae lectt.); and the lxx, Syr., Targ., Arab., Raschi, Kimchi, and others giving the reading &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1514; &#1492; &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1503;, who was a teacher (instructor) in the fear of God, in favour of which also Vitringa, proll. in Jes. p. 4, has decided. </body></html>
