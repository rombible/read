Those only prosper whom God makes to prosper; for prosperity is his gift. Many have owned, that as long as they sought the Lord, and kept close to their duty, they prospered; but when they forsook God, every thing went cross. God never continues either to bless the indolent or to withhold his blessing from the diligent. He will never suffer any to seek his face in vain. Uzziah's name was famed throughout all the neighbouring countries. A name with God and good people makes truly honourable. He did not delight in war, nor addict himself to sports, but delighted in husbandry.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Uzziah - This form of the name is found uniformly in Chronicles (except <a href="/1_chronicles/3-12.htm">1 Chronicles 3:12</a>) and in the prophets. The writer of Kings prefers the form Azariah. Uzziah has been regarded as a phonetic corruption of the real name used by the common people. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/26.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. He built Eloth&#8212;or, "He it was who built Eloth." The account of the fortifications of this port on the Red Sea, which Uzziah restored to the kingdom of Judah (2Ch 33:13), is placed before the chronological notices (2Ch 26:3), either on account of the importance attached to the conquest of Eloth, or from the desire of the historian to introduce Uzziah as the king, who was known as the conqueror of Eloth. Besides, it indicates that the conquest occurred in the early part of his reign, that it was important as a port, and that Hebrew merchants maintained the old trade between it and the countries of the East [Bertheau].<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/26.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> To wit, for a time, but not perfectly nor constantly, which was Amaziahâ€™s case also. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_chronicles/26.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then all the people of Judah took Uzziah,....
