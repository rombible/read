Rehoboam, having now a bitter enemy in Israel, deemed it prudent to lose no time in fortifying several cities that lay along the frontier of his kingdom. Jeroboam, on his side, took a similar precaution (1Ki 12:25). Of the fifteen cities named, Aijalon, now Yalo, and Zorah, now Surah, between Jerusalem and Jabneh [Robinson], lay within the province of Benjamin. Gath, though a Philistine city, had been subject to Solomon. And Etham, which was on the border of Simeon, now incorporated with the kingdom of Israel, was fortified to repel danger from that quarter. These fortresses Rehoboam placed under able commanders and stocked them with provisions and military stores, sufficient, if necessary, to stand a siege. In the crippled state of his kingdom, he seems to have been afraid lest it might be made the prey of some powerful neighbors.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">In every several city, </span> to wit, so fortified, as he said, <span class="bld"><a href="/2_chronicles/11-11.htm" title="And he fortified the strong holds, and put captains in them, and store of victual, and of oil and wine.">2 Chronicles 11:11</a></span><a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_chronicles/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And in every several city he put shields and spears,....
