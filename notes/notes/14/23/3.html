The Spirit of prophecy might direct Elijah to prepare this writing in the foresight of Jehoram's crimes. He is plainly told that his sin should certainly ruin him. But no marvel that sinners are not frightened from sin, and to repentance, by the threatenings of misery in another world, when the certainty of misery in this world, the sinking of their estates, and the ruin of their health, will not restrain them from vicious courses. See Jehoram here stripped of all his comforts. Thus God plainly showed that the controversy was with him, and his house. He had slain all his brethren to strengthen himself; now, all his sons are slain but one. David's house must not be wholly destroyed, like those of Israel's kings, because a blessing was in it; that of the Messiah. Good men may be afflicted with diseases; but to them they are fatherly chastisements, and by the support of Divine consolations the soul may dwell at ease, even when the body lies in pain. To be sick and poor, sick and solitary, but especially to be sick and in sin, sick and under the curse of God, sick and without grace to bear it, is a most deplorable case. Wickedness and profaneness make men despicable, even in the eyes of those who have but little religion.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>By "all the congregation" here is meant the persons referred to in <a href="/2_chronicles/23-2.htm">2 Chronicles 23:2</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/23.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. chief of all the fathers of Israel&#8212;This name is frequently used in Chronicles for Judah and Benjamin, now all that remained of Israel.

As the Lord hath said of the sons of David</span> (see <a href="/2_chronicles/6-16.htm">2 Chronicles 6:16</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/7-18.htm">2 Chronicles 7:18</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12</a>; <a href="/1_kings/2-4.htm">1 Kings 2:4</a>; <a href="/1_kings/9-5.htm">1 Kings 9:5</a>). The hereditary nature of the monarchy (<a href="/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7</a>.), pervaded ever by the spirit of the covenant, is evidently glanced at. It is probable that the existence of Joash was news to those to whom Jehoiada, as the parallel has it, "showed...  the king's son," so that double significance lies in the word "showed." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_chronicles/22.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>And he (Jehu) sought Ahaziah, and they (Jehu's body-guard or his warriors) caught him while he was hiding in Samaria, and brought him to Jehu, and slew him. Then they (his servants, <a href="/2_kings/9-27.htm">2 Kings 9:27</a>) buried him, for they said: He is a son of Jehoshaphat, who sought Jahve with all his heart. We find more exact information as to Ahaziah's death in <a href="/2_kings/9-27.htm">2 Kings 9:27</a>., according to which Ahaziah, overtaken by Jehu near Jibleam in his flight before him, and smitten, i.e., wounded, fled to Megiddo, and there died, and was brought by his servants to Jerusalem, and buried with his fathers in the city of David. For the reconciliation of these statements, see on <a href="/2_kings/9-27.htm">2 Kings 9:27</a>. The circumstance that in our account first the slaughter of the brothers' sons, then that of Ahaziah is mentioned, while according to <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/9.htm">2 Kings 9</a> and 10 the slaughter of Ahaziah would seem to have preceded, does not make any essential difference; for the short account in the Chronicle is not arranged chronologically, but according to the subject, and the death of Ahaziah is mentioned last only in order that it might be connected with the further events which occurred in Judah. The last clause of <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/22-9.htm">2 Chronicles 22:9</a>, "and there was not to the house of Ahab one who would have possessed power for the kingdom," i.e., there was no successor on the throne to whom the government might straightway be transferred, forms a transition to the succeeding account of Athaliah's usurpation. </body></html>
