It is very common, but very lamentable, that men, who in distress or danger, or near death, seem much engaged in seeking and serving God, throw aside all their religion when they have received a merciful deliverance. God quickly brought troubles upon Judah, to awaken the people to repentance, before their hearts were hardened. Thus it becomes us, when we are under the rebukes of Providence, to justify God, and to judge ourselves. If we have humbled hearts under humbling providences, the affliction has done its work; it shall be removed, or the property of it be altered. The more God's service is compared with other services, the more reasonable and easy it will appear. Are the laws of temperance thought hard? The effects of intemperance will be found much harder. The service of God is perfect liberty; the service of our lusts is complete slavery. Rehoboam was never rightly fixed in his religion. He never quite cast off God; yet he engaged not his heart to seek the Lord. See what his fault was; he did not serve the Lord, because he did not seek the Lord. He did not pray, as Solomon, for wisdom and grace; he did not consult the word of God, did not seek to that as his oracle, nor follow its directions. He made nothing of his religion, because he did not set his heart to it, nor ever came up to a steady resolution in it. He did evil, because he never was determined for good.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He prepared not his heart ... - See the margin.

But<p>he prepared not his heart to seek the Lord&#8212;that is, he did not adhere firmly to the good course of reformation he had begun, "and he did evil," for through the unhappy influence of his mother, a heathen foreigner, he had no doubt received in his youth a strong bias towards idolatry (see on [434]1Ki 14:21).   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Prepared not, </span> or <span class="ital">directed not</span>, or <span class="ital">settled not</span>, &c, i.e. although he humbled himself, and seemed penitent for a season, and professed the true religion and worship of God; yet he quickly relapsed into his former sins, because he was not sincere nor serious in his actions, and his heart was not right with God. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_chronicles/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he did evil,....
