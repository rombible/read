It is very common, but very lamentable, that men, who in distress or danger, or near death, seem much engaged in seeking and serving God, throw aside all their religion when they have received a merciful deliverance. God quickly brought troubles upon Judah, to awaken the people to repentance, before their hearts were hardened. Thus it becomes us, when we are under the rebukes of Providence, to justify God, and to judge ourselves. If we have humbled hearts under humbling providences, the affliction has done its work; it shall be removed, or the property of it be altered. The more God's service is compared with other services, the more reasonable and easy it will appear. Are the laws of temperance thought hard? The effects of intemperance will be found much harder. The service of God is perfect liberty; the service of our lusts is complete slavery. Rehoboam was never rightly fixed in his religion. He never quite cast off God; yet he engaged not his heart to seek the Lord. See what his fault was; he did not serve the Lord, because he did not seek the Lord. He did not pray, as Solomon, for wisdom and grace; he did not consult the word of God, did not seek to that as his oracle, nor follow its directions. He made nothing of his religion, because he did not set his heart to it, nor ever came up to a steady resolution in it. He did evil, because he never was determined for good.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That they may know my service, and the service of the kingdom - i. e., that they may contrast the light burthen of the theocracy with the heavy yoke of a foreign monarch. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2Ch 12:13-16.

Possibly, considering the words of <a href="/2_chronicles/11-5.htm">2 Chronicles 11:5-12, 17</a>, this may indicate that Rehoboam was brought down to thinking almost more of the safety of Jerusalem and himself than of the kingdom in its length and breadth. <span class="cmt_word">One and forty years old</span> (see our note, <a href="/2_chronicles/10-8.htm">2 Chronicles 10:8</a>, towards the end, and compare our <a href="/2_chronicles/13-7.htm">2 Chronicles 13:7</a>, as well as the parallel places, <a href="/1_kings/12-8.htm">1 Kings 12:8</a> and 1 Kings 14:21). It cannot be held as conclusively shown that the age of forty-one is incorrect. <span class="cmt_word">An Ammonitess</span> (see <a href="/1_kings/11-1.htm">1 Kings 11:1-9</a>). Rehoboam's mother's name and nationality are noted also, and twice in the parallel (<a href="/1_kings/14-21.htm">1 Kings 14:21, 31</a>). Naamah was possibly the daughter of Nahash (<a href="/1_chronicles/19-1.htm">1 Chronicles 19:1-20:3</a>). The briefness but decidedness of the notifications made as to this mother of Rehoboam leaves us without doubt that there is not lacking significance in them. Schulz (in his ' Scholia in Ver. Test.,' vol. 3.) says the reason is "quia ca filio idololatriae ansam dedisse videtur;" Keil and Bertheau think that, though there was evidence of this in the case of the mention of Asa's mother (<a href="/1_kings/15-13.htm">1 Kings 15:13</a>), the explanation here is that Naamah "appears" to have had, as queen-mother, considerable influence in the government. They do not specify where they find this to "appear" with any marked plainness. It is quite true that, in the successive accounts of the Jewish kings, the name of each mother is mentioned (<a href="/1_kings/15-2.htm">1 Kings 15:2</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/13-2.htm">2 Chronicles 13:2</a>; <a href="/1_kings/22-42.htm">1 Kings 22:42</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/20-32.htm">2 Chronicles 20:32</a>, etc.). We should say it is like the book, so Divine and human, called the Bible, to do so far-seeing and far-reaching a thing as to give the mother's name; and practically to say that Solomon and Naamah were (in special sense for Judah) a repetition of Adam and Eve. How far Judah and her line of kings may have correctly said, <span class="accented">they</span> were answerable for "death and all our woe," the sacred historians say (<a href="/1_kings/11-4.htm">1 Kings 11:4, 9-11, 14, 23, 26, 31, 33, 36</a>; <a href="/1_kings/12-24.htm">1 Kings 12:24</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/11-4.htm">2 Chronicles 11:4</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_chronicles/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>After the capture of the fenced cities of Judah, he marched against Jerusalem. - <a href="/2_chronicles/12-5.htm">2 Chronicles 12:5</a>.
