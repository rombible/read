The chronicler adds, “from under his (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> Jehoram’s) hand,” and assigns a moral ground for the successful rebellion: “For he had forsaken Jehovah, the God of his fathers.” (Thenius can hardly be right in asserting that the chronicler meant to say that Libnah, <span class= "ital">as a city of the priests,</span> refused obedience to the idolatrous king; nor Hitzig, in explaining the revolt as merely a <span class= "ital">religious</span> secession. ) He forsook Jehovah, by “walking in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab,” <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> by adopting and popularising the worship of the Tyrian Baal, to please his wife and her people. In those days friendship with an alien race seems to have involved recognition of their gods.

And the reason is here given, both why God permitted it, and why they did it, because Jehoram was become an idolater.

But that king having been slain in an insurrection at home, his successor thought to ingratiate himself with his new subjects by raising the flag of independence [Josephus]. The attempt was defeated in the first instance by Jehoram, who possessed all the military establishments of his father; but being renewed unexpectedly, the Edomites succeeded in completely emancipating their country from the yoke of Judah (Ge 27:40).

The exact position of Libnah is not known, but it was in the south of Judah, probably not far from Lachish (<span class="ital">Tell-el-Hesi</span>) and from the Edomite territory. The reason of the revolt is probably given in the Pesh. rendering of this clause, viz. “Then did <span class="ital">the Edomites who dwelt in Libnah</span> revolt.” Libnah was perhaps partly Edomite.

It could hardly be from avarice that he slew his brothers, merely to get possession of their property; probably it was because they did not sympathize with the political course which he was entering upon, and disapproved of the idolatrous conduct of Joram and his wife Athaliah. This may be gathered from the fact that in <a href="/2_chronicles/21-13.htm">2 Chronicles 21:13</a> they are called better than Joram. The princes probably drew down upon themselves the wrath of Joram, or of his heathen consort, by disapproving of the slaughter of the royal princes, or by giving other signs of discontent with the spirit of their reign. </body></html>
