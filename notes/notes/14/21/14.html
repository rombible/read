All which calamities were threatened in the writing sent him, that he might not think they came by chance, but by the special direction of Almighty God, as a punishment for his wickedness. But why should his people suffer, who are here threatened to be plagued? 1st, Because their base fear made them comply with him in his idolatry: and, 2d, Because he suffered in his people’s destruction: for as the honour, and safety, and strength of a king lie in the multitude and prosperity of his people; so when they are diminished, and destroyed, the king is very much weakened and endangered by it. <span class="ital">And thy children, and thy wives — </span>Whose lives shall go for the lives of thy brethren.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/21.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>21:12-20 A warning from God was sent to Jehoram. The Spirit of prophecy might direct Elijah to prepare this writing in the foresight of Jehoram's crimes. He is plainly told that his sin should certainly ruin him. But no marvel that sinners are not frightened from sin, and to repentance, by the threatenings of misery in another world, when the certainty of misery in this world, the sinking of their estates, and the ruin of their health, will not restrain them from vicious courses. See Jehoram here stripped of all his comforts. Thus God plainly showed that the controversy was with him, and his house. He had slain all his brethren to strengthen himself; now, all his sons are slain but one. David's house must not be wholly destroyed, like those of Israel's kings, because a blessing was in it; that of the Messiah. Good men may be afflicted with diseases; but to them they are fatherly chastisements, and by the support of Divine consolations the soul may dwell at ease, even when the body lies in pain. To be sick and poor, sick and solitary, but especially to be sick and in sin, sick and under the curse of God, sick and without grace to bear it, is a most deplorable case. Wickedness and profaneness make men despicable, even in the eyes of those who have but little religion.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The fulfillment of the threat is given in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-16.htm">2 Chronicles 21:16-17</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13-19. hast made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem &#8230; like to the whoredoms of the house of Ahab&#8212;that is, introduced the superstitions and vices of Phœnician idolatry (see on [444]De 13:6-14). On this account, as well as for his unnatural cruelties, divine vengeance was denounced against him, which was soon after executed exactly as the prophet had foretold. A series of overwhelming calamities befell this wicked king; for in addition to the revolts already mentioned, two neighboring tribes (see 2Ch 17:11) made hostile incursions on the southern and western portions of his kingdom. His country was ravaged, his capital taken, his palace plundered, his wives carried off, and all his children slain except the youngest. He himself was seized with an incurable dysentery, which, after subjecting him to the most painful suffering for the unusual period of two years, carried him off, a monument of the divine judgment. To complete his degradation, his death was unlamented, his burial unhonored by his subjects. This custom, similar to what obtained in Egypt, seems to have crept in among the Hebrews, of giving funeral honors to their kings, or withholding them, according to the good or bad characters of their reign.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The Lord will smite thy people.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Quest.</span> Why the people for his sin? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Answ.</span> 1.
