Elijah, though a very old man, may have been still alive. His extreme age would account for his sending a written prophecy, rather than going in person to warn Jehoram. If, however, it be supposed that the author of Kings has told the story of Elijah’s translation in its right place chronologically, and that the campaign described in the following chapter, in which Jehoshaphat took part, was really subsequent to that event, we may say that this “writing from Elijah the prophet,” containing the substance of some last utterances of his directed against Jehoram and Athaliah, was now put into written shape, and forwarded to Jehoram by one of the prophet’s pupils, perhaps by his great successor Elisha. (See <a href="/2_kings/2-15.htm" title="And when the sons of the prophets which were to view at Jericho saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah does rest on Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him.">2Kings 2:15</a>; <a href="/2_kings/3-11.htm" title="But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD, that we may inquire of the LORD by him? And one of the king of Israel's servants answered and said, Here is Elisha the son of Shaphat, which poured water on the hands of Elijah.">2Kings 3:11</a>.) This explanation may seem to be favoured by the indefiniteness of the phrase, “a writing from Elijah” (<span class= "ital">not</span> a letter); but <a href="/2_kings/3-11.htm" title="But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD, that we may inquire of the LORD by him? And one of the king of Israel's servants answered and said, Here is Elisha the son of Shaphat, which poured water on the hands of Elijah.">2Kings 3:11</a> is hardly conclusive against the assumption that Elijah was still alive. Elisha’s ministry may have begun, probably did begin, some time before his master’s ascension, and the description of him in <a href="/2_kings/3-11.htm" title="But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD, that we may inquire of the LORD by him?

Therefore Josephus and the LXX. imagine (as Grotius observes) that from thence he sent a letter. Dr. Lightfoot is of opinion, that it is not meant of that Elijah who was carried up to heaven, but of another of his name, who sent this letter. Kimchi is of opinion that Elijah, foreseeing, by the spirit of prophecy, before he went to heaven, the wickedness of Jehoram, spake these words to one of the prophets, and charged him to put them down in writing, and send them in a letter to Jehoram, when he grew so impious, as is here related; and let him know that Elijah commanded this writing to be delivered to him: that so Jehoram, being affected with it, as if it had been sent from heaven, might be moved to repent of the evil he had done. And indeed the passage will bear this sense. <span class="ital">He </span>did not send a writing, but it was sent as <span class="ital">his </span>writing. For there is nothing in the words to intimate that this was written after his death, but only delivered after his death. So that it might have been written (for any thing that appears to the contrary) by Elijah himself before he was taken up into heaven. But, upon the whole, as we find the prophets were sent to those of their own time, and not to those who should come after, (there being a succession of prophets raised up for every age,) and as we have no mention of any other Elijah, in any other place of Scripture; and as (agreeable to what our Saviour makes Abraham say to the rich man, when he desired Lazarus to be sent from the dead to his brethren, <span class="ital">They have Moses and the prophets,</span>) we have no rational ground for thinking that God should employ a prophet, whom he had taken into heaven on this occasion, when there was, at that time, a prophet on the earth no ways inferior to him, namely, Elisha his successor: therefore there is ground to conclude, that the difficulty has arisen by the inaccuracy of transcribers of the Scriptures, and that it should be, and was at first written <span class="ital">Elisha, </span>and not <span class="ital">Elijah.</span><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/21.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>21:12-20 A warning from God was sent to Jehoram. The Spirit of prophecy might direct Elijah to prepare this writing in the foresight of Jehoram's crimes. He is plainly told that his sin should certainly ruin him. But no marvel that sinners are not frightened from sin, and to repentance, by the threatenings of misery in another world, when the certainty of misery in this world, the sinking of their estates, and the ruin of their health, will not restrain them from vicious courses. See Jehoram here stripped of all his comforts. Thus God plainly showed that the controversy was with him, and his house. He had slain all his brethren to strengthen himself; now, all his sons are slain but one. David's house must not be wholly destroyed, like those of Israel's kings, because a blessing was in it; that of the Messiah. Good men may be afflicted with diseases; but to them they are fatherly chastisements, and by the support of Divine consolations the soul may dwell at ease, even when the body lies in pain. To be sick and poor, sick and solitary, but especially to be sick and in sin, sick and under the curse of God, sick and without grace to bear it, is a most deplorable case. Wickedness and profaneness make men despicable, even in the eyes of those who have but little religion.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This is the only notice which we have of Elijah in Chronicles.

This noun does not occur very frequently, but is found in the following passages, viz.: <a href="/exodus/32-16.htm">Exodus 32:16</a>; <a href="/exodus/39-30.htm">Exodus 39:30</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/10-4.htm">Deuteronomy 10:4</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/35-4.htm">2 Chronicles 35:4</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/36-22.htm">2 Chronicles 36:22</a>; <a href="/ezra/1-1.htm">Ezra 1:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/38-8.htm">Isaiah 38:8</a>. A note in Grove's interesting article, "Elijah" (Smith's 'Bible Dictionary' vol. 1. p. 580), says that the word is almost identical with the Arabic word of the present day, while the ordinary Hebrew word for a "letter" is <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b5;&#x5e4;&#x5b6;&#x5d3;</span> oftener rendered "book." <span class="cmt_word">There came</span>. That this is the precise language used rather helps the persuasion that it was the well-known Prophet Elijah of Israel, who, not resident in Judah, and perhaps very near the end of his life, and in sight of his translation, was taught and directed divinely to send this message of rebuke and terror for Jehoram. <span class="cmt_word">Elijah</span> <span class="cmt_word">the prophet.</span> Some hold that it certainly was not the well-known prophet of the northern kingdom who is here intended. "Time, place, and circumstance," says Professor Dr. James G. Murphy, of Belfast ('Handbook to the Books of Chronicles,' p. 127), difference him "from the Tishbite." And he confidently considers him (with Cajetan) another Elijah (<a href="/ezra/10-21.htm">Ezra 10:21</a>), or Eliah (<a href="/1_chronicles/8-27.htm">1 Chronicles 8:27</a>; <a href="/ezra/10-26.htm">Ezra 10:26</a>; for the form rendered so), or Eliyahu, in which form the Hebrew name appears (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>. or <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;</span>, being the forms of the name found), on the grounds that the Tishbite was translated in the time of Jehoram's father Jehoshaphat (<a href="/2_kings/3-11.htm">2 Kings 3:11</a>); that his sphere was in the northern kingdom, and himself more of one who wrought mighty works and spoke <span class="accented">otherwise</span> than as a prophet; and that the designation "the prophet" need by no means denote him exclusively. He adds that a "writing" from a prophet is nothing strange, which may be easily conceded but poorly instanced by <a href="/1_chronicles/28-19.htm">1 Chronicles 28:19</a>; better by <a href="/jeremiah/36-1.htm">Jeremiah 36:1, 2, 6</a>. On the other hand, Grove (in article above quoted) and others find no invincible difficulty in accepting this Elijah for the famous prophet. His mention here is, of course, exceedingly interesting. as the only mention of him in Chro-nicles - a fact which very remarkably falls in with the abstinence as well as the fulness of the compiler of Chronicles. Josephus pronounces that the letter was sent during Elijah's life ('Ant.,' 9:05. &sect; 2), surmises to the contrary having been made. While Elijah's translation seems to have taken place before Jehoshaphat's death, from what we read of <span class="accented">Elisha</span> (<a href="/2_kings/3-11.htm">2 Kings 3:11</a>), we may well account that Elisha had begun his <span class="accented">ministry before</span> his master's translation. Not only the ether passages that confirm, but in especial the passage (<a href="/2_kings/1-17.htm">2 Kings 1:17</a>) which tells of Jehoram's being, before his father's death, on the throne of Judah at the time of Elijah's interview with Ahaziah (a passage that occurs immediately preceding the account of Elijah's last acts), might have led us to suppose that Elijah's letter was before Jehoshaphat's death, during the joint reign, but for the mention of the slaying of his sons. Bertheau, in our text in his 'Chronik,' points out the resemblance which the "writing" shows to the matter of the speeches of Elijah, while in certain respects of style, and the very insulated sort of introduction it has here, it greatly differs from the narrative in which it is now set. Although the calculation may seem rather a fine one, the circumstances described accurately point to the "writing" of Elijah reaching Jehoram before the chronologically misplaced translation of Elijah as given in <a href="/2_kings/2-1.htm">2 Kings 2:1-11</a>. This question may be instanced as one of the interesting moot points by no means compassed with insuperable difficulty, but challenging careful study and patient comparison of chronological and historical passages. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_chronicles/21.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Duration and spirit of Joram's reign. - These verses agree with <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/8-17.htm">2 Kings 8:17-22</a>, with the exception of some immaterial divergences, and have been commented upon in the remarks on that passage. - In <a href="/2_chronicles/21-7.htm">2 Chronicles 21:7</a> the thought is somewhat otherwise expressed than in <a href="/2_kings/8-19.htm">2 Kings 8:19</a> : "Jahve would not destroy the house of David, because of the covenant that He had made with David;" instead of, "He would not destroy Judah because of David His servant, as He had said."
