Public ordinances should stir us up to cleanse our hearts, our houses, and shops, from the filth of sin, and the idolatry of covetousness, and to excite others to do the same. The after-improvement of solemn ordinances, is of the greatest importance to personal, family, and public religion. When they had tasted the sweetness of God's ordinance in the late passover, they were free in maintaining the temple service. Those who enjoy the benefit of a settled ministry, will not grudge the expense of it. In all that Hezekiah attempted in God's service, he was earnest and single in his aim and dependence, and was prospered accordingly. Whether we have few or many talents intrusted to us, may we thus seek to improve them, and encourage others to do the same. What is undertaken with a sincere regard to the glory of God, will succeed to our own honour and comfort at last.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/31.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The porter toward the east - i. e. the chief door-keeper at the east gate, where the proper number of the porters was six <a href="/1_chronicles/26-17.htm">1 Chronicles 26:17</a>.<p>The most holy things - The sin-offerings and trespass-offerings <a href="/leviticus/6-25.htm">Leviticus 6:25</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/7-1.htm">Leviticus 7:1-6</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/31.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2Ch 31:11-19.

Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of the Lord&#8212;storehouses, granaries, or cellars; either the old ones, which had been allowed through neglect to fall into decay, were to be repaired, or additional ones built. Private individuals brought their own first-fruits to the temple; but the tithes were levied by the Levites, who kept a faithful account of them in their several places of abode and transmitted the allotted proportion to the priests. Officers were appointed to distribute equal rations to all in the cities of the priests who, from age or other reasons, could not repair to the temple. With the exception of children under three years of age&#8212;an exception made probably from their being considered too young to receive solid food&#8212;lists were kept of the number and age of every male; of priests according to their fathers' house, and Levites from twenty years (see Nu 4:3; 28:24; 1Ch 23:24).
