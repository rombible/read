Public ordinances should stir us up to cleanse our hearts, our houses, and shops, from the filth of sin, and the idolatry of covetousness, and to excite others to do the same. The after-improvement of solemn ordinances, is of the greatest importance to personal, family, and public religion. When they had tasted the sweetness of God's ordinance in the late passover, they were free in maintaining the temple service. Those who enjoy the benefit of a settled ministry, will not grudge the expense of it. In all that Hezekiah attempted in God's service, he was earnest and single in his aim and dependence, and was prospered accordingly. Whether we have few or many talents intrusted to us, may we thus seek to improve them, and encourage others to do the same. What is undertaken with a sincere regard to the glory of God, will succeed to our own honour and comfort at last.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/31.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The king's portion - Amid the general neglect of the observances commanded by the Law, the tithe system had naturally fallen into disuse. Hezekiah revived it; and, to encourage the people to give what was due, cheerfully set the example of paying the full proportion from his own considerable possessions (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-28.htm">2 Chronicles 32:28-29</a>). His tithe was, it seems, especially devoted to the purposes mentioned in this verse (compare the marginal reference). There were needed for these purposes in the course of the year nearly 1,100 lambs, 113 bullocks, 37 rams, and 30 goats, besides vast quantities of flour, oil, and wine for the accompanying meat and drink offerings. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/31.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2-5. Hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests, &c.&#8212;The king now turned his attention to provide for the orderly performance of the temple-worship&#8212;arranging the priests and Levites in their courses, assigning to every one his proper place and functions&#8212;and issuing edicts for the regular payment of those dues from which the revenues of the sanctuary were derived. To set a proper example to his subjects, his own proportion was announced in the first instance, for to the king it belonged, out of his privy purse, to defray the expenses of the altar, both stated and occasional (Nu 28:3, 4, 9, 11, 19); and in making this contribution from his own means, Hezekiah followed the course which David and Solomon had taken before him (see 2Ch 8:14; 1Ki 9:25). Afterwards he reappointed the people's dues to the temple; and from its being necessary to issue a royal mandate in reference to this matter, it appears that the sacred tribute had been either totally neglected, or (as the idolatrous princes were known to appropriate it to their own purposes) the people had in many cases refused or evaded the duty. But with the improved state of public feeling, Hezekiah's commandment was readily obeyed, and contributions of first-fruits and tithes were poured in with great liberality from all parts of Judah, as well as from Israel. The first-fruits, even of some articles of produce that were unfit for sacrifice (Le 2:11), such as honey (Margin, "dates"), were appropriated to the priests (Nu 18:12, 13; De 18:4). The tithes (Le 27:31) were intended for the support of the whole Levitical tribe (Nu 18:8, 20, 24).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/31.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">For the burnt-offerings; </span> which had hitherto been, and were to be, taken out of the treasures of the temple which were collected from the people, <span class="bld"><a href="/1_chronicles/26-20.htm" title="And of the Levites, Ahijah was over the treasures of the house of God, and over the treasures of the dedicated things.">1 Chronicles 26:20</a> <a href="/nehemiah/10-32.htm" title="Also we made ordinances for us, to charge ourselves yearly with the third part of a shekel for the service of the house of our God;">Nehemiah 10:32</a>,33</span>; but that he might ease them in their present poverty, which his predecessor had brought upon them, and engage them to a more cheerful attendance upon God’s service, he took the burden upon himself. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_chronicles/31.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>He appointed also the king's portion of his substance,....

His "port, on" was the tithe, and he was evidently liable on "substance very much" (<a href="/2_chronicles/32-29.htm">2 Chronicles 32:29</a>). <a href="/numbers/28.htm">Numbers 28, 29</a>, and <a href="/leviticus/23.htm">Leviticus 23</a>. give us the particulars of the offerings and set feasts, respectively here alluded to, in their original prescription. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_chronicles/30.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Prolongation of the festival for seven days more, and the conclusion of it. - <a href="/2_chronicles/30-23.htm">2 Chronicles 30:23</a>. Since the king and the princes had given a very large number of beasts for sacrifice as thank-offerings, it was resolved to keep joy for other seven days, i.e., to keep them festally, with sacrificial meals. The expression &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;, to hold or celebrate days, is similar to &#1508;&#1505;&#1495; &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;, to hold the passover. &#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1492;&#1492; is an adverbial accusative: in joy. For this resolution two reasons are given in <a href="/2_chronicles/30-24.htm">2 Chronicles 30:24</a> : 1. Hezekiah had given to the assembly 1000 bullocks and 7000 head of small cattle, and the princes had given 1000 bullocks and 10,000 head of small cattle besides; so that there was more than they could use during the seven days of the Mazzoth feast. Bertheau incorrectly supposes that these were "rich gifts for further sacrificial feasts." The gifts were bestowed for the Mazzoth festival, but were so plentiful that they sufficed for another festival of seven days. &#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, like &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492;, denotes to bestow, i.e., to present beasts, etc., with the design that they should be used as sacrifices; cf. <a href="/2_chronicles/35-7.htm">2 Chronicles 35:7</a>. 2. The second reason: "priests also had sanctified themselves in multitude," so as to be able to carry on the service at the altar, even with such numerous sacrifices, refers back to <a href="/2_chronicles/30-15.htm">2 Chronicles 30:15</a> and <a href="/2_chronicles/30-3.htm">2 Chronicles 30:3</a>. </body></html>
