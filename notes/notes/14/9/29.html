True wisdom and happiness are always united together; but no such alliance exists between wealth and the enjoyment of the things of this life. Let us then acquaint ourselves with the Saviour, that we may find rest for our souls. Here is Solomon reigning in wealth and power, in ease and fulness, the like of which could never since be found; for the most known of the great princes of the earth were famed for their wars; whereas Solomon reigned forty years in profound peace. The promise was fulfilled, that God would give him riches and honour, such as no kings have had or shall have. The lustre wherein he appeared, was typical of the spiritual glory of the kingdom of the Messiah, and but a faint representation of His throne, which is above every throne. Here is Solomon dying, and leaving all his wealth and power to one who he knew would be a fool! Ec 2:18,19. This was not only vanity, but vexation of spirit. Neither power, wealth, nor wisdom, can ward off or prepare for the stroke of death. But thanks be to God who giveth the victory to the true believer, even over this dreaded enemy, through Jesus Christ our Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The book of Nathan ... - On the "books" here mentioned, see the introduction to Chronicles, the second note.<p>We hear nothing of Iddo in Kings: but he is mentioned below twice <a href="/2_chronicles/12-15.htm">2 Chronicles 12:15</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/13-22.htm">2 Chronicles 13:22</a>.

His completion of the grand work, the centralizing of the national worship at Jerusalem, whither the natives went up three times a year, has given his name a prominent place in the history of the ancient church. But his reign had a disastrous influence upon "the peculiar people," and the example of his deplorable idolatries, the connections he formed with foreign princes, the commercial speculations he entered into, and the luxuries introduced into the land, seem in a great measure to have altered and deteriorated the Jewish character.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Iddo the seer, </span> mentioned also <span class="bld"><a href="/1_chronicles/12-15.htm" title="These are they that went over Jordan in the first month, when it had overflowed all his banks; and they put to flight all them of the valleys, both toward the east, and toward the west.">1 Chronicles 12:15</a></span>, supposed to be the same who is called <span class="ital">Obed</span>, <span class="bld"><a href="/2_chronicles/15-1.htm" title="And the Spirit of God came on Azariah the son of Oded:">2 Chronicles 15:1</a></span>.

The present quotation of the name of Ahijah in connection with his work, and the brief allusion to himself in our <a href="/2_chronicles/10-15.htm">2 Chronicles 10:15</a>, are the only appearances of Ahijah in Chronicles.
