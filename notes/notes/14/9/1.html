The Queen of Sheba Visits Solomon; She Admires His Wisdom and Magnificence.<p>1-4. when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon&#8212;(See on [428]1Ki 10:1-13). It is said that among the things in Jerusalem which drew forth the admiration of Solomon's royal visitor was "his ascent by which he went up into the house of the Lord." This was the arched viaduct that crossed the valley from Mount Zion to the opposite hill. In the commentary on the passage quoted above, allusion was made to the recent discovery of its remains. Here we give a full account of what, for boldness of conceptions for structure and magnificence, was one of the greatest wonders in Jerusalem. "During our first visit to the southwest corner of the area of the mosque, we observed several of the large stones jutting out from the western wall, which at first seemed to be the effect of a bursting of the wall from some mighty shock or earthquake. We paid little regard to this at the moment; but on mentioning the fact not long after to a circle of our friends, the remark was incidentally dropped that the stones had the appearance of having once belonged to a large arch. At this remark, a train of thought flashed across my mind, which I hardly dared to follow out until I had again repaired to the spot, in order to satisfy myself with my own eyes as to the truth or falsehood of the suggestion. I found it even so. The courses of these immense stones occupy their original position; their external surface is hewn to a regular curve; and, being fitted one upon another, they form the commencement or foot of an immense arch which once sprung out from this western wall in a direction towards Mount Zion, across the Tyropœon valley. This arch could only have belonged to the bridge, which, according to Josephus, led from this part of the temple to the Xystus (covered colonnade) on Zion; and it proves incontestably the antiquity of that portion from which it springs" [Robinson]. The distance from this point to the steep rock of Zion Robinson calculates to be about three hundred and fifty feet, the probable length of this ancient viaduct. Another writer adds, that "the arch of this bridge, if its curve be calculated with an approximation to the truth, would measure sixty feet, and must have been one of five sustaining the viaduct (allowing for the abutments on either side), and that the piers supporting the center arch of this bridge must have been of great altitude&#8212;not less, perhaps, than one hundred and thirty feet. The whole structure, when seen from the southern extremity of the Tyropœon, must have had an aspect of grandeur, especially as connected with the lofty and sumptuous edifices of the temple, and of Zion to the right and to the left" [Isaac Taylor's Edition of Traill's Josephus].The queen of Sheba visiteth Solomon, and admireth his wisdom; giveth and receiveth presents, <span class="bld"><a href="/context/2_chronicles/9-1.htm" title="And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to prove Solomon with hard questions at Jerusalem, with a very great company, and camels that bore spices, and gold in abundance, and precious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart....">2 Chronicles 9:1-12</a></span>.

Sheba</span>. This was the name of a descendant of Cush, a Hamite (<a href="/genesis/10-7.htm">Genesis 10:7</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/1-9.htm">1 Chronicles 1:9</a>); also of a son of Joktan, a Shemite (<a href="/genesis/10-28.htm">Genesis 10:28</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/1-22.htm">1 Chronicles 1:22</a>); also of a son of Jokshan, Abraham's son by Keturah (<a href="/genesis/25-3.htm">Genesis 25:3</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/1-32.htm">1 Chronicles 1:32</a>). It is quite uncertain who of these constituted, or preponderated in, the country of Sheba here referred to. This is probably Saba, the capital of Yemen, an important province of Arabia, west of the Red Sea, north of the Indian Ocean, and extending upward nearly to Idumaea. The city was reputed splendid, the country wealthy, and long as the most southerly inhabited part of the world. If it were, as is believed, first occupied by Cushites it was afterwards peopled also by Joktanites and Jokahanites, as above. In addition- to the two celebrated allusions to it, ever memorable, see as other references, <a href="/job/6-19.htm">Job 6:19</a>; <a href="/psalms/72-10.htm">Psalm 72:10, 15</a>; <a href="/isaiah/60-6.htm">Isaiah 60:6</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/6-20.htm">Jeremiah 6:20</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/27-22.htm">Ezekiel 27:22, 23</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/38-18.htm">Ezekiel 38:18</a>; <a href="/matthew/12-42.htm">Matthew 12:42</a>; <a href="/luke/11-31.htm">Luke 11:31</a> (see also Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 3:1232). The hard questions consisted in riddles (<a href="/judges/14-2.htm">Judges 14:2</a>) and enigmas and primitive casuistry, in which the Arabians found some considerable portion of their mental gymnastics These, no doubt, bore some mild cousinly relationship to the proverbs and songs of Solomon, and his treasures of botanical and natural history facts (<a href="/1_kings/4-29.htm">1 Kings 4:29-32</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Spices</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, here as also in the parallel. This word is used twenty-one times, and in a slightly varied form (as in the ninth verse of this same chapter) nine more times. It is almost always translated (Authorized Version) by this same word "spice" or "spices" (except <a href="/exodus/30-23.htm">Exodus 30:23</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/16-14.htm">2 Chronicles 16:14</a>; <a href="/esther/2-12.htm">Esther 2:12</a>; <a href="/isaiah/3-24.htm">Isaiah 3:24</a>).

Precious stones</span>. These were used for sacred purposes, and for domestic and dress ornaments, and were graven upon in early times by the Hebrews The chief of those mentioned in the Old Testament are the carbuncle, sardius, topaz (<a href="/exodus/39-10.htm">Exodus 39:10</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/28-13.htm">Ezekiel 28:13</a>), diamond, emerald, sapphire (<a href="/exodus/39-11.htm">Exodus 39:11</a>); <a href="/ezekiel/28-13.htm">Ezekiel 28:13</a>), agate, amethyst, ligure (<a href="/exodus/39-12.htm">Exodus 39:12</a>), beryl, jasper, onyx (<a href="/genesis/2-12.htm">Genesis 2:12</a>; <a href="/exodus/39-6.htm">Exodus 39:6, 13</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/28-13.htm">Ezekiel 28:13</a>), ruby (<a href="/job/28-18.htm">Job 28:18</a>; <a href="/proverbs/3-15.htm">Proverbs 3:15</a>), chrysolite, chrysoprasus (<a href="/ezekiel/28-13.htm">Ezekiel 28:13</a>). The precious stones which the queen brought are likely enough, however, to have comprised other varieties (including the pearl from the Persian Gulf), such as Pliny describes; and see in particular <a href="/1_chronicles/29-2.htm">1 Chronicles 29:2</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/27-16.htm">Ezekiel 27:16</a>; and the art.
