Both without doors and within, there was that which typified the grace of the gospel, and shadowed out good things to come, of which the substance is Christ. There was the brazen altar. The making of this was not mentioned in the book of Kings. On this all the sacrifices were offered, and it sanctified the gift. The people who worshipped in the courts might see the sacrifices burned. They might thus be led to consider the great Sacrifice, to be offered in the fulness of time, to take away sin, and put an end to death, which the blood of bulls and goats could not possibly do. And, with the smoke of the sacrifices, their hearts might ascend to heaven, in holy desires towards God and his favour. In all our devotions we must keep the eye of faith fixed upon Christ. The furniture of the temple, compared with that of the tabernacle, showed that God's church would be enlarged, and his worshippers multiplied. Blessed be God, there is enough in Christ for all.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>According to their form - Rather, "after their manner" (compare <a href="/2_chronicles/4-20.htm">2 Chronicles 4:20</a>). There is no allusion to the shape of the candlesticks, which were made, no doubt, after the pattern of the original candlestick of Moses. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. ten candlesticks&#8212;(See on [416]1Ki 7:49). The increased number was not only in conformity with the characteristic splendor of the edifice, but also a standing emblem to the Hebrews, that the growing light of the word was necessary to counteract the growing darkness in the world [Lightfoot].<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">According to their form; </span> either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. the form which was appointed for them by God, who signified it to David.

And this clause seems to be added here, because in many things there was a great variation from the old form, as in the posture of the cherubims, the height of the altar, and divers other things. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_chronicles/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>See Introduction to Chapter 4 <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_chronicles/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And he made ten candlesticks of gold according to <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> their form, and set <i>them</i> in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left.</span><p>(e) Even as they should be made.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ten candlesticks of gold</span>. The only allusion to these in the parallel is found later on in part of the forty-ninth verse of <a href="/1_kings/7.htm">1 Kings 7</a>. According to their form. This expression, though so vague, might point to the fact that the form of the old candlestick of the tabernacle was adhered to (<a href="/exodus/25-31.htm">Exodus 25:31</a>). But considering the recurrence of the same words (ver. 20), there can be no doubt that the phrase is identical in its meaning with the use found in such passages as <a href="/leviticus/5-10.htm">Leviticus 5:10</a>; <a href="/leviticus/9-16.htm">Leviticus 9:16</a>, and means "according to the prescribed ordinance," <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_chronicles/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div><a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/4-1.htm">2 Chronicles 4:1-6</a>. The copper furniture of the court. <a href="/2_chronicles/4-1.htm">2 Chronicles 4:1</a>. The altar of burnt-offering. Its preparation is passed over in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/6.htm">1 Kings 6</a> and 7, so that there it is only mentioned incidentally in connection with the consecration of the temple, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/8-22.htm">1 Kings 8:22</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/8-54.htm">1 Kings 8:54</a>, and <a href="/1_kings/9-25.htm">1 Kings 9:25</a>. It was twenty cubits square (long and broad) and ten cubits high, and constructed on the model of the Mosaic altar of burnt-offering, and probably of brass plates, which enclosed the inner core, consisting of earth and unhewn stones; and if we may judge from Ezekiel's description, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-13.htm">Ezekiel 43:13-17</a>, it rose in steps, as it were, so that at each step its extent was smaller; and the measurement of twenty cubits refers only to the lowest scale, while the space at the top, with the hearth, was only twelve cubits square; cf. my Bibl. Archaeol. i. S. 127, with the figure, plate iii. fig. 2.</body></html>
