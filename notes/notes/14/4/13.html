Both without doors and within, there was that which typified the grace of the gospel, and shadowed out good things to come, of which the substance is Christ. There was the brazen altar. The making of this was not mentioned in the book of Kings. On this all the sacrifices were offered, and it sanctified the gift. The people who worshipped in the courts might see the sacrifices burned. They might thus be led to consider the great Sacrifice, to be offered in the fulness of time, to take away sin, and put an end to death, which the blood of bulls and goats could not possibly do. And, with the smoke of the sacrifices, their hearts might ascend to heaven, in holy desires towards God and his favour. In all our devotions we must keep the eye of faith fixed upon Christ. The furniture of the temple, compared with that of the tabernacle, showed that God's church would be enlarged, and his worshippers multiplied. Blessed be God, there is enough in Christ for all.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The number of the tables (see <a href="/2_chronicles/4-19.htm">2 Chronicles 4:19</a>) and of the basins, is additional to the information contained in Kings. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11.

This number of pomegranates substantially agrees with the parallel (<a href="/1_kings/7-20.htm">1 Kings 7:20</a>), There were two hundred of them on each wreath that encircled the chapiter. The pomegranate was a favourite ornament in work as well as in more solid architectural forms (<a href="/exodus/28-33.htm">Exodus 28:33, 34</a>).

The description of the pomegranate as a fruit may be found in any Bible dictionary, but especially in Tristram's 'Natural History of the Bible.' <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_chronicles/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The golden furniture of the holy place and the courts.

No reason can be given for the omission of these verses in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/7.htm">1 Kings 7</a>; but that they have been omitted or have dropped out, may be concluded from the fact that not only do the whole contents of our fourth chapter correspond to the section <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/7-23.htm">1 Kings 7:23-50</a>, but both passages are rounded off by the same concluding verse (<a href="/2_chronicles/5-1.htm">2 Chronicles 5:1</a> and <a href="/1_kings/7-51.htm">1 Kings 7:51</a>).<p><a href="/2_chronicles/4-7.htm">2 Chronicles 4:7</a><p>He made ten golden candlesticks &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;&#1501;, according to their right, i.e., as they should be according to the prescript, or corresponding to the prescript as to the golden candlesticks in the Mosaic sanctuary (<a href="/exodus/25-31.htm">Exodus 25:31</a>.). &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496; is the law established by the Mosaic legislation.</body></html>
