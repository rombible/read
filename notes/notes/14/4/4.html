Both without doors and within, there was that which typified the grace of the gospel, and shadowed out good things to come, of which the substance is Christ. There was the brazen altar. The making of this was not mentioned in the book of Kings. On this all the sacrifices were offered, and it sanctified the gift. The people who worshipped in the courts might see the sacrifices burned. They might thus be led to consider the great Sacrifice, to be offered in the fulness of time, to take away sin, and put an end to death, which the blood of bulls and goats could not possibly do. And, with the smoke of the sacrifices, their hearts might ascend to heaven, in holy desires towards God and his favour. In all our devotions we must keep the eye of faith fixed upon Christ. The furniture of the temple, compared with that of the tabernacle, showed that God's church would be enlarged, and his worshippers multiplied. Blessed be God, there is enough in Christ for all.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For "oxen" we find in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/7-24.htm">1 Kings 7:24</a>, "knops" or "gourds."

Two rows of oxen were cast, when it was cast&#8212;The meaning is, that the circular basin and the brazen oxen which supported it were all of one piece, being cast in one and the same mould. There is a difference in the accounts given of the capacity of this basin, for while in 1Ki 7:26 it is said that two thousand baths of water could be contained in it, in this passage no less than three thousand are stated. It has been suggested that there is here a statement not merely of the quantity of water which the basin held, but that also which was necessary to work it, to keep it flowing as a fountain; that which was required to fill both it and its accompaniments. In support of this view, it may be remarked that different words are employed: the one in 1Ki 7:26 rendered contained; the two here rendered, received and held. There was a difference between receiving and holding. When the basin played as a fountain, and all its parts were filled for that purpose, the latter, together with the sea itself, received three thousand baths; but the sea exclusively held only two thousand baths, when its contents were restricted to those of the circular basin. It received and held three thousand baths [Calmet, Fragments].<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_chronicles/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>See Introduction to Chapter 4 <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_chronicles/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea was set above upon them, and all their hinder parts were inward.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/2_chronicles/4.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">4</span>. <span class="ital">three … and three … and three … and three</span>] Thus the base stood “foursquare,” satisfying the Hebrew idea of completeness; cp. <a href="/context/revelation/21-12.htm" title="And had a wall great and high, and had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel:...">Revelation 21:12-16</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - The words of the Hebrew text of this verse and the parallel (<a href="/1_kings/7-25.htm">1 Kings 7:25</a>) are facsimiles. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_chronicles/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The two brazen pillars before the house, i.e., before the porch, whose form is more accurately described in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/7-15.htm">1 Kings 7:15-22</a>.
