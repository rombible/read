Both without doors and within, there was that which typified the grace of the gospel, and shadowed out good things to come, of which the substance is Christ. There was the brazen altar. The making of this was not mentioned in the book of Kings. On this all the sacrifices were offered, and it sanctified the gift. The people who worshipped in the courts might see the sacrifices burned. They might thus be led to consider the great Sacrifice, to be offered in the fulness of time, to take away sin, and put an end to death, which the blood of bulls and goats could not possibly do. And, with the smoke of the sacrifices, their hearts might ascend to heaven, in holy desires towards God and his favour. In all our devotions we must keep the eye of faith fixed upon Christ. The furniture of the temple, compared with that of the tabernacle, showed that God's church would be enlarged, and his worshippers multiplied. Blessed be God, there is enough in Christ for all.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The entry of the house - The text is, by some, corrected by <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/7-50.htm">1 Kings 7:50</a>, "the hinges" of the doors of the house, etc. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11.

A slightly different form of the word is translated "pruning-hooks "four times in the Prophets Isaiah, Joel, Micah. No doubt these <span class="accented">snuffers</span> were something different from the <span class="accented">tongs</span> of the preceding verse; the use of one may have been rather to cut the wicks, and the other to trim them. <span class="cmt_word">The spoons;</span> Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;</span>. This is the word used so often for the "hand," but the essential idea of which is the <span class="accented">hollow</span> of either hand or foot or other thing, and among other things of a spoon shape.
