But there seems no reason—unless we suppose that each writer has given an exhaustive description, which is clearly not the case—why the ornamental rows which ran round the great basin should not have included both features, small figures of oxen, as well as wild gourds. Reuss objects on the ground of the diminutive size of the axon (“ten in a cubit”); but such work was by no means beyond the resources of ancient art. (Comp. the reliefs on the bronze doors of Shalmaneser 11. (859-825 B.C. ); <a href="/1_kings/7-29.htm" title="And on the borders that were between the ledges were lions, oxen, and cherubim: and on the ledges there was a base above: and beneath the lions and oxen were certain additions made of thin work.">1Kings 7:29</a> actually gives an analogous instance.) The word <span class= "ital">pĕqā’îm,</span> “wild gourds,” only occurs in one other place of Kings, viz., <a href="/1_kings/6-18.htm" title="And the cedar of the house within was carved with knops and open flowers: all was cedar; there was no stone seen.">1Kings 6:18</a>. (Comp. <span class= "ital">paqqû‘ôth,</span> <a href="/2_kings/4-39.htm" title="And one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered thereof wild gourds his lap full, and came and shred them into the pot of pottage: for they knew them not.">2Kings 4:39</a>.) A copyist of Kings might nave inadvertently repeated the word from the former passage in <a href="/1_kings/7-24.htm" title="And under the brim of it round about there were knops compassing it, ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about: the knops were cast in two rows, when it was cast.">1Kings 7:24</a>. In any case it is sheer dogmatism to assert that “the copyists (in the Chronicle) have absurdly changed the gourds into oxen” (Reuss). The Syriac and Arabic omit this verse; but the LXX. and Vulg. have it.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:1-22 The furniture of the temple. - Here is a further account of the furniture of God's house. Both without doors and within, there was that which typified the grace of the gospel, and shadowed out good things to come, of which the substance is Christ. There was the brazen altar. The making of this was not mentioned in the book of Kings. On this all the sacrifices were offered, and it sanctified the gift. The people who worshipped in the courts might see the sacrifices burned. They might thus be led to consider the great Sacrifice, to be offered in the fulness of time, to take away sin, and put an end to death, which the blood of bulls and goats could not possibly do. And, with the smoke of the sacrifices, their hearts might ascend to heaven, in holy desires towards God and his favour. In all our devotions we must keep the eye of faith fixed upon Christ. The furniture of the temple, compared with that of the tabernacle, showed that God's church would be enlarged, and his worshippers multiplied. Blessed be God, there is enough in Christ for all.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For "oxen" we find in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/7-24.htm">1 Kings 7:24</a>, "knops" or "gourds." An early copyist, not comprehending the comparatively rare word here used for "gourd," and expecting to hear of oxen, as soon as the molten sea was mentioned, changed the reading. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. Two rows of oxen were cast, when it was cast&#8212;The meaning is, that the circular basin and the brazen oxen which supported it were all of one piece, being cast in one and the same mould. There is a difference in the accounts given of the capacity of this basin, for while in 1Ki 7:26 it is said that two thousand baths of water could be contained in it, in this passage no less than three thousand are stated. It has been suggested that there is here a statement not merely of the quantity of water which the basin held, but that also which was necessary to work it, to keep it flowing as a fountain; that which was required to fill both it and its accompaniments. In support of this view, it may be remarked that different words are employed: the one in 1Ki 7:26 rendered contained; the two here rendered, received and held. There was a difference between receiving and holding. When the basin played as a fountain, and all its parts were filled for that purpose, the latter, together with the sea itself, received three thousand baths; but the sea exclusively held only two thousand baths, when its contents were restricted to those of the circular basin. It received and held three thousand baths [Calmet, Fragments].<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_chronicles/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>See Introduction to Chapter 4 <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_chronicles/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And under <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> it <i>was</i> the similitude of oxen, which did compass it round about: <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about.

Read (cp. <a href="/1_kings/7-24.htm" title="And under the brim of it round about there were knops compassing it, ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about: the knops were cast in two rows, when it was cast.">1 Kings 7:24</a>), <span class="bld">under it there were knops</span>, “knops” being embossed ornaments of some kind.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">ten in a cubit</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">for ten cubits</span>. According to the A.V. there would be ten “knops” in every eighteen inches of the circumference, but the Hebrew is more correctly represented by the R.V. Probably there is some corruption of the text here (and in <a href="/1_kings/7-24.htm" title="And under the brim of it round about there were knops compassing it, ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about: the knops were cast in two rows, when it was cast.">1 Kings 7:24</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Two rows of oxen were cast, when it was cast</span>] Correct the reading as before and render, <span class="bld">The knops were in two rows, cast when it was cast</span>.

The presence of the word "similitude" strongly suggests that the circles of decoration under description showed the likenesses of oxen, not necessarily (as Patrick) "stamped" on the so-called knops, but possibly constituting them. For the ambiguous under it of our present verse the parallel says with definiteness, "under the brim of it." There is intelligibility, at all events, in the ornamentation being of these miniature oxen, presumably three hundred in the circle of the thirty cubits. The symbolism would harmonize with that which dictated the superposition of the enormous vase on twelve probably life-size oxen. There is a general preference, however, accorded to the opinion that the present text has probably been the result of some copyist's corruption, and that the text of the parallel should be followed. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_chronicles/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The veil between the holy place and the most holy, not mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/6-21.htm">1 Kings 6:21</a>, was made of the same materials and colours as the veil on the tabernacle, and was inwoven with similar cherub figures; cf. <a href="/exodus/26-31.htm">Exodus 26:31</a>. &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509; &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1502;&#1497;&#1500; as in <a href="/2_chronicles/2-13.htm">2 Chronicles 2:13</a>.   &#1506;&#1500;&#1492; &#1506;&#1500;, to bring upon; an indefinite expression for: to weave into the material. </body></html>
