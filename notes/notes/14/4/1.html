Both without doors and within, there was that which typified the grace of the gospel, and shadowed out good things to come, of which the substance is Christ. There was the brazen altar. The making of this was not mentioned in the book of Kings. On this all the sacrifices were offered, and it sanctified the gift. The people who worshipped in the courts might see the sacrifices burned. They might thus be led to consider the great Sacrifice, to be offered in the fulness of time, to take away sin, and put an end to death, which the blood of bulls and goats could not possibly do. And, with the smoke of the sacrifices, their hearts might ascend to heaven, in holy desires towards God and his favour. In all our devotions we must keep the eye of faith fixed upon Christ. The furniture of the temple, compared with that of the tabernacle, showed that God's church would be enlarged, and his worshippers multiplied.

We hold the text to be correct, and translate: "the wings of these cherubim were, for they stretched them out, twenty cubits." &#1493;&#1492;&#1501; refers to &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501;. They stood upon their feet, consequently upright, and were, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/6-26.htm">1 Kings 6:26</a>, ten cubits high. "And their faces towards the house," i.e., turned towards the holy place, not having their faces turned towards each other, as was the case with the cherubim upon the Capporeth (<a href="/exodus/25-20.htm">Exodus 25:20</a>). </body></html>
