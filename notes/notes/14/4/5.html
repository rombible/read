But it is more likely that the numeral “three” having been inadvertently omitted from the text of Kings, the indefinite word “thousands” was made definite by turning it into the dual “two thousand” Either mistake would be possible, because in the unpointed text <span class= "ital">‘alāphîm</span> and <span class= "ital">’alpayim</span> are written alike.

Both without doors and within, there was that which typified the grace of the gospel, and shadowed out good things to come, of which the substance is Christ. There was the brazen altar. The making of this was not mentioned in the book of Kings. On this all the sacrifices were offered, and it sanctified the gift. The people who worshipped in the courts might see the sacrifices burned. They might thus be led to consider the great Sacrifice, to be offered in the fulness of time, to take away sin, and put an end to death, which the blood of bulls and goats could not possibly do. And, with the smoke of the sacrifices, their hearts might ascend to heaven, in holy desires towards God and his favour. In all our devotions we must keep the eye of faith fixed upon Christ. The furniture of the temple, compared with that of the tabernacle, showed that God's church would be enlarged, and his worshippers multiplied. Blessed be God, there is enough in Christ for all.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Three thousand baths - See <a href="/1_kings/7-23.htm">1 Kings 7:23</a> note.

Two rows of oxen were cast, when it was cast&#8212;The meaning is, that the circular basin and the brazen oxen which supported it were all of one piece, being cast in one and the same mould. There is a difference in the accounts given of the capacity of this basin, for while in 1Ki 7:26 it is said that two thousand baths of water could be contained in it, in this passage no less than three thousand are stated. It has been suggested that there is here a statement not merely of the quantity of water which the basin held, but that also which was necessary to work it, to keep it flowing as a fountain; that which was required to fill both it and its accompaniments. In support of this view, it may be remarked that different words are employed: the one in 1Ki 7:26 rendered contained; the two here rendered, received and held. There was a difference between receiving and holding. When the basin played as a fountain, and all its parts were filled for that purpose, the latter, together with the sea itself, received three thousand baths; but the sea exclusively held only two thousand baths, when its contents were restricted to those of the circular basin. It received and held three thousand baths [Calmet, Fragments].<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_chronicles/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>See Introduction to Chapter 4 <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_chronicles/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the thickness of it <i>was</i> an handbreadth, and the brim of it like the work of the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies; <i>and</i> it received and held <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> three thousand baths.</span><p>(d) In the first book of the kings, 1Ki 7:26, mention is only made of 2000, but the lesser number was taken there, and here according as the measures proved afterwards, is declared.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/2_chronicles/4.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5</span>. <span class="ital">the brim of it like the work of the brim of a cup,</span> with <span class="ital">flowers of lilies</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">three thousand baths</span>] In <a href="/1_kings/7-26.htm" title="And it was an hand breadth thick, and the brim thereof was worked like the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies: it contained two thousand baths.">1 Kings 7:26</a>, <span class="ital">two thousand baths</span>.

The parallel has two thousand baths, and this latter is the likelier reading. It is, however, conceivable that the statement of Kings may purport to give the quantity of water used, and that of Chronicles the quantity which the vessel at its fullest could accommodate. As to the real capacity of the bath, we are hopelessly at sea. Josephus's estimate of it is about eight gallons and a half, that of the rabbinists about four gallons and a half (see Smith's 'Dictionary of the Bible,' 3:1742), and Conder, in the 'Handbook to the Bible,' p. 80, a fractional quantity above six gallons. The largest bowls on the Assyrian bas-reliefs, the silver bowl of Croesus, and the bronze bowl in Scythia (Herodotus, 1:51; 4:81), did not, under the lowest estimate of the bath, hold as much as one-half of the contents of this vast sea of brass of Solomon. The use of this vessel was, as we read in the next verse, for the priests to wash in, or, as some would read, to wash at (<a href="/exodus/30-18.htm">Exodus 30:18-20</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_chronicles/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"And he made little chains on the collar (Halsreife), and put it on the top of the pillars, and made 100 pomegranates, and put them on the chains." In the first clause of this verse, &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1512;, "in (on) the most holy place," has no meaning, for the most holy place is not here being discussed, but the pillars before the porch, or rather an ornament on the capital of these pillars. We must not therefore think of chains in the most holy place, which extended thence out to the pillars, as the Syriac and Arabic seem to have done, paraphrasing as they do: chains of fifty cubits (i.e., the length of the holy place and the porch). According to <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/7-17.htm">1 Kings 7:17-20</a> and <a href="/1_kings/7-41.htm">1 Kings 7:41</a>., compared with <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/4-12.htm">2 Chronicles 4:12-13</a>, each capital consisted of two parts. The lower part was a circumvolution (Wulst) covered with chain-like net-work, one cubit high, with a setting of carved pomegranates one row above and one row below. The upper part, or that which formed the crown of the capital, was four cubits high, and carved in the form of an open lily-calyx. In our verse it is the lower part of the capital, the circumvolution, with the chain net-work and the pomegranates, which is spoken of. From this, Bertheau concludes that &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1512; must signify the same as the more usual &#1513;&#1474;&#1489;&#1499;&#1492;, viz., "the lattice-work which was set about the top of the pillars, and served to fasten the pomegranates," and that bdbyr has arisen out of &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1489;&#1497;&#1491; by a transposition of the letters. &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1489;&#1497;&#1491; (chains) should be read here. This conjecture so decidedly commends itself, that we regard it as certainly correct, since &#1512;&#1489;&#1497;&#1491; denotes in <a href="/genesis/41-42.htm">Genesis 41:42</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-11.htm">Ezekiel 16:11</a>, a necklace, and so may easily denote also a ring or hoop; but we cannot adopt the translation "chains on a ring," nor the idea that the &#1513;&#1474;&#1489;&#1499;&#1492;, since it surrounded the head of the pillars as a girdle or broad ring, is called the ring of the pillars. For this idea does not agree with the translation "chains in a ring," even when they are conceived of as "chain-like ornaments, which could scarcely otherwise be made visible on the ring than by open work." Then the chain-like decorations were not, as Bertheau thinks, on the upper and under border of the ring, but formed a net-work which surrounded the lower part of the capital of the pillar like a ring, as though a necklace had been drawn round it. &#1512;&#1489;&#1497;&#1491; consequently is not the same as &#1513;&#1474;&#1489;&#1499;&#1492;, but rather corresponds to that part of the capital which is called &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; (&#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;) in <a href="/1_kings/7-14.htm">1 Kings 7:14</a>; for the &#1513;&#1474;&#1489;&#1499;&#1493;&#1514; served to cover the &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, and were consequently placed on or over the &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, as the pomegranates were on the chains or woven work. &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; denotes the curve, the circumvolution, which is in <a href="/1_kings/7-20.htm">1 Kings 7:20</a> called &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1496;&#1503;, a broad-arched band, bulging towards the middle, which formed the lower part of the capital. This arched part of the capital the author of the Chronicle calls &#1512;&#1489;&#1497;&#1491;, ring or collar, because it may be regarded as the neck ornament of the head of the pillar, in contrast to the upper part of the capital, that consisted in lily-work, i.e., the ball wrought into the form of an open lily-calyx (&#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1512;&#1514;( xylac-).</body></html>
