In each of those instances the Hebrew text shows <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5d0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, and the Authorized Version "chief" except inconsistently in our ver. 11. Revised Version "chief" in all the instances. The name "priest" occurs just about six hundred and sixty-six times in the Old Testament, the title "high" or "chief priest" only about twenty-six times, the first occurrence being in <a href="/leviticus/21-10.htm">Leviticus 21:10</a>, the last <a href="/zechariah/6-11.htm">Zechariah 6:11</a>; and both set forth by the Hebrew adjective <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;</span>, as also in fifteen other of the occurrences.

In these last two cases, however (<a href="/ezra/8-24.htm">Ezra 8:24, 29</a>; <a href="/ezra/10-5.htm">Ezra 10:5</a>), it is not "high priests" nor "chief priests" that are perhaps even really intended, but the "princes" of the priests, or those who, for whatever reasons of personal characteristics, were <span class="accented">chief. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Out of Judah and out of Jerusalem</span>.

This source of money for the holy design of Joash is again most specifically stated in our ver. 9. The version of this whole transaction seems rather confusing as given in the parallel, where ver. 4 mentions three sources of money, without any quotation as such of the ordained tax of Moses, which was apparently the first of those three, and where ver. 8, at first blush at any rate, might seem to imply <span class="accented">recusant</span> priests. The meaning, however, is probably the contrary, the verse purporting that the priests consented to forego what they had been accustomed on receiving to apply to some personal or current-funds purpose, and who consented to forego the superintending of the outlay of the money on. the repairing, that it might be done with more expedition by "scribe" and high priest" (ver. 10; comp. ver. 16; both of the parallel). All these details the writer of Chronicles passes over, only pursuing the essential business, Joash's pious resolve, the delay in its execution, and how he finally overcame the obstructive delay. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_chronicles/23.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The renewal of the covenant, extirpation of Baal-worship, and the solemn entry of the king into his palace, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/11-17.htm">2 Kings 11:17-20</a>, and already commented on in that place. The remark as to the renewal of the covenant is in <a href="/2_chronicles/23-16.htm">2 Chronicles 23:16</a> (Chron.) somewhat more brief than in <a href="/2_kings/11-17.htm">2 Kings 11:17</a>; and &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;, between himself, the same as between himself, the high priest, as representative of Jehovah. In <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/11-17.htm">2 Kings 11:17</a>, the matter is more clearly expressed. In <a href="/2_kings/11-18.htm">2 Kings 11:18</a>., the statement, "the priest set overseers over the house of Jahve," is expanded by the addition of the words, "by means of the Levitic priests whom David had distributed for the house of Jahve to offer sacrifices;...and he placed doorkeepers at the doors of the house of Jahve," etc. The meaning is: Jehoiada again introduced the old arrangement of the public worship in the temple as David had settled it, it having either fallen into decay or wholly ceased under the rule of the idolatrous Athaliah.
