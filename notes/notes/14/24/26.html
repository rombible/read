Yet many MSS. of Kings read “Joza-bad.” “Shomer” in Kings should probably be Shemer (<a href="/1_chronicles/7-32.htm" title="And Heber begat Japhlet, and Shomer, and Hotham, and Shua their sister.">1Chronicles 7:32</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/7-34.htm" title="And the sons of Shamer; Ahi, and Rohgah, Jehubbah, and Aram.">1Chronicles 7:34</a>), of which Shimri (<a href="/1_chronicles/4-37.htm" title="And Ziza the son of Shiphi, the son of Allon, the son of Jedaiah, the son of Shimri, the son of Shemaiah;">1Chronicles 4:37</a>) and Shimrith might be by-forms. Reuss is incorrect in asserting that the names of the <span class= "ital">mothers</span> are substituted by the chronicler for the names of the <span class= "ital">fathers.</span> Thenius even knows the reason why the chronicler has added the epithets “Ammonitess,” “Moabitess.” The writer wished to show that the idolatry into which he makes Joash lapse (?), was avenged by two sons of idolatrous wives (!). This is fancy determined by prejudice. The additions “Ammonitess,” “Moabitess,” indicate the use of another source than the canonical book of Kings; and the same may be said of the strikingly original account of the death of Zechariah (<a href="/context/2_chronicles/24-17.htm" title="Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah, and made obeisance to the king. Then the king listened to them.">2Chronicles 24:17-22</a>). What that source was the next verse declares, viz., “The Midrash of the book of the Kings.”<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/24.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>24:15-27 See what a great judgment on any prince or people, the death of godly, zealous, useful men is. See how necessary it is that we act in religion from inward principle. Then the loss of a parent, a minister, or a friend, will not be losing our religion. Often both princes and inferior people have been flattered to their ruin. True grace alone will enable a man to bring forth fruit unto the end. Zechariah, the son of Jehoiada, being filled with the Spirit of prophecy, stood up, and told the people of their sin. This is the work of ministers, by the word of God, as a lamp and a light, to discover the sin of men, and expound the providences of God. They stoned Zechariah to death in the court of the house of the Lord. Observe the dying martyr's words: The Lord look upon it, and require it! This came not from a spirit of revenge, but a spirit of prophecy. God smote Joash with great diseases, of body, or mind, or both, before the Syrians departed from him. If vengeance pursue men, the end of one trouble will be but the beginning of another. His own servants slew him. These judgments are called the burdens laid upon him, for the wrath of God is a heavy burden, too heavy for any man to bear. May God help us to take warning, to be upright in heart, and to persevere in his ways to the end.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They executed judgment against Joash - By defeating his army, slaying his nobles, and pressing on against Jerusalem, etc. (<a href="/2_kings/12-18.htm">2 Kings 12:18</a> note). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/24.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>25. they left him in great diseases&#8212;The close of his life was embittered by a painful malady, which long confined him to bed.<p>his own servants conspired against him&#8212;These two conspirators (whose fathers were Jews, but their mothers aliens) were probably courtiers, who, having constant access to the bedchamber, could the more easily execute their design.<p>for the blood of the sons&#8212;read "the son" of Jehoiada.
