The Syrian invasion may have been already threatening, when his prophecy was uttered; and in that case it would be easy to allege against the prophet that his “wish was father to his thought.” (Comp. the similar case of Jeremiah, <a href="/context/jeremiah/32-1.htm" title="The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar.">Jeremiah 32:1-5</a>; and <a href="/context/1_kings/21-8.htm" title="So she wrote letters in Ahab's name, and sealed them with his seal, and sent the letters to the elders and to the nobles that were in his city, dwelling with Naboth.">1Kings 21:8-13</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">In the court of the house of the Lord.</span>—There is little doubt that the allusion of Christ (<a href="/matthew/23-35.htm" title="That on you may come all the righteous blood shed on the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias, whom you slew between the temple and the altar.">Matthew 23:35</a>; <a href="/luke/11-51.htm" title="From the blood of Abel to the blood of Zacharias which perished between the altar and the temple: truly I say to you, It shall be required of this generation.">Luke 11:51</a>) to the death of “Zacharias son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the Temple and the altar,” refers to this murder. The altar stood in the court, before the Temple. Barachias (Berechiah) may have been Zechariah’s father, and Jehoiada his grandfather. Moreover the Lord appears to be thinking of the honourable burial of Jehoiada, in contrast with the murder of his son, in <a href="/context/matthew/23-29.htm" title="Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because you build the tombs of the prophets, and garnish the sepulchers of the righteous,">Matthew 23:29-32</a>, verses which immediately precede the mention of Zacharias.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/2_chronicles/24.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/2_chronicles/24-21.htm" title="And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of the LORD.">2 Chronicles 24:21</a></span>. <span class="ital">And they conspired against him — </span>Namely, the people whom he addressed, having been easily corrupted by the examples of their apostate king and princes. <span class="ital">And stoned him with stones </span>— And that immediately, without even colour of law; not so much as accusing him of being a blasphemer, a traitor, a false prophet, or guilty of any crime whatever; <span class="ital">at the commandment of the king — </span>Who owed his crown and life to Jehoiada his father; and <span class="ital">in the court of the house of the Lord — </span>Whose minister and messenger he was!

That a king, a king in covenant with God, should command the murder of one whom it was his office to protect and countenance! The Jews say, there were seven transgressions in one: they killed a priest, a prophet, a judge; they shed innocent blood; polluted the court of the temple, the sabbath, and the day of expiation: for on that day, their tradition says, this happened.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/24.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>24:15-27 See what a great judgment on any prince or people, the death of godly, zealous, useful men is. See how necessary it is that we act in religion from inward principle. Then the loss of a parent, a minister, or a friend, will not be losing our religion. Often both princes and inferior people have been flattered to their ruin. True grace alone will enable a man to bring forth fruit unto the end. Zechariah, the son of Jehoiada, being filled with the Spirit of prophecy, stood up, and told the people of their sin. This is the work of ministers, by the word of God, as a lamp and a light, to discover the sin of men, and expound the providences of God. They stoned Zechariah to death in the court of the house of the Lord. Observe the dying martyr's words: The Lord look upon it, and require it! This came not from a spirit of revenge, but a spirit of prophecy. God smote Joash with great diseases, of body, or mind, or both, before the Syrians departed from him. If vengeance pursue men, the end of one trouble will be but the beginning of another. His own servants slew him. These judgments are called the burdens laid upon him, for the wrath of God is a heavy burden, too heavy for any man to bear. May God help us to take warning, to be upright in heart, and to persevere in his ways to the end.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In the court of the house of the Lord - "Between the altar and the Temple," or directly in front of the temple porch, if it be this Zechariah of whom our Lord speaks <a href="/matthew/23-35.htm">Matthew 23:35</a>. A horror of the impious deed long possessed the Jews, who believed that the b ood could not be effaced, but continued to bubble on the stones of the court, like blood newly shed, until the temple was entered, just prior to its destruction, by Nebuzaradan. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/24.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20, 21. the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada&#8212;probably a younger son, for his name does not occur in the list of Aaron's successors (1Ch 6:4-47).<p>stood above the people&#8212;Being of the priestly order, he spoke from the inner court, which was considerably higher than that of the people.<p>and said unto them, Thus saith God, Why transgress ye the commandments of the Lord, that ye cannot prosper, &c.&#8212;His near relationship to the king might have created a feeling of delicacy and reluctance to interfere; but at length he, too, was prompted by an irresistible impulse to protest against the prevailing impiety. The bold freedom and energy of [Zechariah's] remonstrance, as well as his denunciation of the national calamities that would certainly follow, were most unpalatable to the king; while they so roused the fierce passions of the multitude that a band of miscreants, at the secret instigation of Joash, stoned him to death. This deed of violence involved complicated criminality on the part of the king. It was a horrid outrage on a prophet of the Lord&#8212;base ingratitude to a family who had preserved his life&#8212;atrocious treatment of a true Hebrew patriot&#8212;an illegal and unrighteous exercise of his power and authority as a king.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/24.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">They conspired, </span> i. e. the people to whom he preached, who were easily corrupted by the examples of their apostate king and princes. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_chronicles/24.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And they conspired against him,....

With the death of the grey-haired high priest came a turning-point in the reign of Joash. Jehoiada had saved the life and throne of Joash, preserved to the kingdom the royal house of David, to which the promises belonged, and had put an end to the idolatry which had been transplanted into Judah by Joram's marriage into the royal house of Ahab, restoring the Jahve-worship. For this he was honoured at his death, his body being laid in the city of David among the kings: "For he had done good in Israel, and towards God and His house" (the temple). According to <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/12-7.htm">2 Kings 12:7</a>, he still took an active part in the repair of the temple in the twenty-third year of Joash, and according to <a href="/2_chronicles/24-14.htm">2 Chronicles 24:14</a> he lived for some time after the completion of that work. But after his death the people soon forgot the benefits they owed him. </body></html>
