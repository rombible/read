The compound adverbial expression <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span>, here used for "from," era-braces the idea of" unfailingly from year to year." The command given here to the priests and Levites is expressed very differently, though in no degree contadictorily, in the parallel (see its vers. 4, 5). The addition is there found, "every man of his acquaintance;" this expression may glance at the very supposable circumstance that the priest and Levite collecting deputations would naturally go respectively to the towns and cities where they had been located beforetime. A slight ambiguity is perhaps occasioned by the impression that the fourth verse (in the parallel) produces - that the priests and Levites should wait to <span class="accented">receive, e.g.</span>, in Jerusalem. This, however, is sot what is <span class="accented">said</span>, and need not, therefore, be made into a difficulty. <span class="cmt_word">Howbeit the Levites hastened not.</span> We are not told <span class="accented">why</span> this delay was, nor does the subsequent narrative seem to elucidate it, further than this - that the delay somehow seemed to rest with Jehoiada, as the king appealed to him for explanation. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_chronicles/23.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The renewal of the covenant, extirpation of Baal-worship, and the solemn entry of the king into his palace, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/11-17.htm">2 Kings 11:17-20</a>, and already commented on in that place. The remark as to the renewal of the covenant is in <a href="/2_chronicles/23-16.htm">2 Chronicles 23:16</a> (Chron.) somewhat more brief than in <a href="/2_kings/11-17.htm">2 Kings 11:17</a>; and &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;, between himself, the same as between himself, the high priest, as representative of Jehovah. In <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/11-17.htm">2 Kings 11:17</a>, the matter is more clearly expressed. In <a href="/2_kings/11-18.htm">2 Kings 11:18</a>., the statement, "the priest set overseers over the house of Jahve," is expanded by the addition of the words, "by means of the Levitic priests whom David had distributed for the house of Jahve to offer sacrifices;...and he placed doorkeepers at the doors of the house of Jahve," etc. The meaning is: Jehoiada again introduced the old arrangement of the public worship in the temple as David had settled it, it having either fallen into decay or wholly ceased under the rule of the idolatrous Athaliah.
