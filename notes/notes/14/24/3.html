It is easier to build temples, than to be temples to God. But the repairing of places for public worship is a good work, which all should promote.

One of his wives in question was probably "Jehoaddan of Jerusalem," the mother of Amaziah <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-1.htm">2 Chronicles 25:1</a>, who must have been taken to wife by Joash as early as his 21st year. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/24.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3.

Not for himself; he had a wife who was aunt to King Joash, and he had sons who were concerned with him in anointing him, <a href="/2_chronicles/22-11.htm">2 Chronicles 22:11</a> and was now upwards of one hundred years of age; but for the king, when he was at an age fit for marriage, he advised him to marry, and proposed wives to him, whom he thought would be agreeable; for, observing what mischief was done both in church and state through Jehoram's marrying Athaliah, he was desirous of preventing any such disagreeable marriage; and as the young king was in all things guided and directed by him, so he was in this; and no doubt they were good women he pitched upon, and proposed to the king; one of them was Jehoadan, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-1.htm">2 Chronicles 25:1</a>, but the name of the other we know not: <p>and he begat sons and daughters; how many is not said, nor do we read of the names of any of them, but of Amaziah who succeeded him. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_chronicles/24.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And Jehoiada took for him two wives; and he begat sons and daughters.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - That special note is made of Jehoiada's selecting of the wives may at any rate point to the suggestion that he was all a father to Joash, and both for his own sake and the kingdom's sake anxious as to the character of the women by whom a new kingly seed should take rise in place of that destroyed by Athaliah (<a href="/2_chronicles/22-10.htm">2 Chronicles 22:10</a>). Our <a href="/2_chronicles/25-1.htm">2 Chronicles 25:1</a> leaves it probable that "Jehoaden of Jerusalem" was one of these, though it is likely enough that Joash married, whether her or some one else, <span class="accented">before</span> he had reached the age of twenty-one. It is also quite likely that we may read between the lines, that in selecting <span class="accented">two</span> wives for his young and loved ward, Jehoiada hoped and prayed that Joash might not fall by sin like Solomon's (<a href="/1_kings/11-3.htm">1 Kings 11:3</a>) and that of others of the kings of both Judah and Israel. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_chronicles/23.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The renewal of the covenant, extirpation of Baal-worship, and the solemn entry of the king into his palace, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/11-17.htm">2 Kings 11:17-20</a>, and already commented on in that place. The remark as to the renewal of the covenant is in <a href="/2_chronicles/23-16.htm">2 Chronicles 23:16</a> (Chron.) somewhat more brief than in <a href="/2_kings/11-17.htm">2 Kings 11:17</a>; and &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;, between himself, the same as between himself, the high priest, as representative of Jehovah. In <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/11-17.htm">2 Kings 11:17</a>, the matter is more clearly expressed. In <a href="/2_kings/11-18.htm">2 Kings 11:18</a>., the statement, "the priest set overseers over the house of Jahve," is expanded by the addition of the words, "by means of the Levitic priests whom David had distributed for the house of Jahve to offer sacrifices;...and he placed doorkeepers at the doors of the house of Jahve," etc. The meaning is: Jehoiada again introduced the old arrangement of the public worship in the temple as David had settled it, it having either fallen into decay or wholly ceased under the rule of the idolatrous Athaliah. As to the remainder, see on <a href="/2_kings/11-19.htm">2 Kings 11:19</a> and <a href="/2_kings/11-20.htm">2 Kings 11:20</a>. </body></html>
