It must be in the place David had prepared, not only which he had purchased, but which he had fixed on by Divine direction. Full instructions enable us to go about our work with certainty and to proceed therein with comfort. Blessed be God, the Scriptures are enough to render the man of God thoroughly furnished for every good work. Let us search the Scriptures daily, beseeching the Lord to enable us to understand, believe, and obey his word, that our work and our way may be made plain, and that all may be begun, continued, and ended in him. Beholding God, in Christ, his true Temple, more glorious than that of Solomon's, may we become a spiritual house, a habitation of God through the Spirit.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>As in the oracle - This passage is probably corrupt. Our translators supposing that a single letter had fallen out at the beginning of the word translated "in the oracle," supplied "as." But we have no reason to suppose there were any "chains" or "festoons" in the "oracle" or most holy place. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2Ch 3:14-17. Veil and Pillars (see 1Ki 6:21).<p>The united height is here given; and though the exact dimensions would be thirty-six cubits, each column was only seventeen cubits and a half, a half cubit being taken up by the capital or the base. They were probably described as they were lying together in the mould before they were set up [Poole]. They would be from eighteen to twenty-one feet in circumference, and stand forty feet in height. These pillars, or obelisks, as some call them, were highly ornamented, and formed an entrance in keeping with the splendid interior of the temple.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_chronicles/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>See Chapter Introduction <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_chronicles/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And he reared up the pillars before the temple, one on the right hand, and the other on the left; and called the name of that on the right hand Jachin, and the name of that on the left Boaz.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/2_chronicles/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">17</span>. <span class="ital">he reared up</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">he set up</span> (as in <a href="/1_kings/7-21.htm" title="And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple: and he set up the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin: and he set up the left pillar, and called the name thereof Boaz.">1 Kings 7:21</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Jachin … Boaz</span>] R.V. mg. translates the two words; <span class="ital">Jachin</span> “he shall establish,” <span class="ital">Boaz</span> perhaps “In it is strength.” LXX. gives <span class="greekheb">Κατόρθωσις</span> (“setting up”) and <span class="greekheb">Ἰσχύς</span> (“strength”).

The margin of our Authorized Version gives with sufficient correctness the meaning of these names of the pillars, which purport to set forth the safety and sure strength that belong to those who wait on, and who calmly and constantly abide by, the Divine leading. The latter, however, is one word, a substantive, not a compound of preposition, pronoun, and substantive; and the former, though by derivation the future of the hiph. conjugation of the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5df;</span>, is established as a substantive in its own right. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_chronicles/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The figures of the cherubim are called &#1510;&#1506;&#1510;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; &#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;, sculpture work. The &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;.. &#1510;&#1506;&#1510;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; comes from &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;, Arab. s&#803;a&#770;g&#769;, formavit, finxit, and signifies sculptures. The plur. &#1497;&#1510;&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, "they overlaid them," is indefinite. The length of the wings was five cubits, and the four outspread wings extended across the whole width of the most holy place from one wall to the other. The repetition of the clauses &#1492;&#1488;&#1492;&#1512; &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;...&#1492;&#1488;&#1492;&#1491; &#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1507; (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/3-11.htm">2 Chronicles 3:11</a>, <a href="/2_chronicles/3-12.htm">2 Chronicles 3:12</a>) has a distributive force: the top of one wing of each cherub reached the wall of the house, that of the other wing reached the wing of the other cherub standing by. In the repetition the masc. &#1502;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1506; alternates with the fem. &#1502;&#1490;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514;, being construed in a freer way as the principal gender with the fem. &#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1507;, and also with &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1511;&#1492;, adhaerebat, in the last clause. - In <a href="/2_chronicles/3-12.htm">2 Chronicles 3:12</a> Bertheau would strike out the word &#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1508;&#1497; because it does not suit &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1501;, which occurs in <a href="/1_chronicles/28-17.htm">1 Chronicles 28:17</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/5-8.htm">2 Chronicles 5:8</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/8-7.htm">1 Kings 8:7</a>, in the transitive signification, "to stretch out the wings." But nothing is gained by that, for we must then supply the erased word after &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1501; again. And, moreover, the succeeding clause is introduced by &#1493;&#1492;&#1501;, just because in the first clause the wings, and not the cherubim, were the subject. We hold the text to be correct, and translate: "the wings of these cherubim were, for they stretched them out, twenty cubits." &#1493;&#1492;&#1501; refers to &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501;. They stood upon their feet, consequently upright, and were, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/6-26.htm">1 Kings 6:26</a>, ten cubits high. "And their faces towards the house," i.e., turned towards the holy place, not having their faces turned towards each other, as was the case with the cherubim upon the Capporeth (<a href="/exodus/25-20.htm">Exodus 25:20</a>). </body></html>
