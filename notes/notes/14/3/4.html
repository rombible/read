It is out of the question that the porch should be of this height in itself. And almost as much out of the question that, if it could be so, this should be the only place to mention it by word or. description. There can be no doubt that the text is here slightly corrupt, and perhaps it is a further indication of this that, while the parallel contains <span class="accented">nothing</span> of the height, <span class="accented">this</span> place fails (but comp. our ver. 8) to give the breadth ("ten cubits"), which the parallel does give. The words for" hundred" and for "cubit" easily confuse with one another. And our present Hebrew text, <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b5;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x20;&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, read <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5e2;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, will make good Hebrew syntax, and be in harmony with the Septuagint (Alexandrian), and with the Syriac and Arabic Versions. This gives the height of the porch as 20 cubits, which will be in harmony with the general height of the building, which was 30 cubits. Thus far, then, the plan of the temple is plain. The house is 60 cubits long, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> 20 for the holy of holies (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span> or <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b9;&#x5d3;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x20;&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>);40 for the holy place (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;</span>); and for breadth 20 cubits. The porch was in <span class="accented">length</span> the same as the breadth of the <span class="accented">house</span>, viz. 20 cubits, but in <span class="accented">breadth</span> it was 10 cubits (<a href="/1_kings/6-3.htm">1 Kings 6:3</a>) only, while its height was 20 cubits, against a height of 30 cubits for the "house" (<a href="/1_kings/6-2.htm">1 Kings 6:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Overlaid it within with pure gold</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> covered the planks with gold leaf, or sometimes with plates of gold (Ovid., 'L Epp. ex. Pont,' 1:37, 38, 41, 42; Herod., 1:98; Polyb., 10:27. &sect; 10). The appreciation, as well as bare knowledge, of gold belonged to a very early date (<a href="/genesis/2-12.htm">Genesis 2:12</a>). The days when it was used in ring or lump (though not in coin) for sign of wealth and for purposes of exchange, and also for ornament (<a href="/genesis/13-2.htm">Genesis 13:2</a>; <a href="/genesis/24-22.htm">Genesis 24:22</a>; <a href="/genesis/42-21.htm">Genesis 42:21</a>), indicate how early were the beginnings of metallurgy as regards it, though much more developed afterwards (<a href="/judges/17-4.htm">Judges 17:4</a>; <a href="/proverbs/17-3.htm">Proverbs 17:3</a>; <a href="/isaiah/40-19.htm">Isaiah 40:19</a>; <a href="/isaiah/46-9.htm">Isaiah 46:9</a>); and show it in the time of David and Solomon no rare art, even though foreign workmen, for obvious reasons, were the most skilful workers with it. There are four verbs used to express the idea of overlaying, viz. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, in hiph. This occurs only in this chapter, vers. 5, 7, 8, 9; but in niph. <a href="/psalms/68-13.htm">Psalm 68:13</a> may be compared. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> in hiph. This occurs in the present sense, though not necessarily staying very closely by it; in <a href="/2_chronicles/9-15.htm">2 Chronicles 9:15, 16</a>, and its parallel (<a href="/1_kings/10-16.htm">1 Kings 10:16, 17</a>); and perhaps in <a href="/2_samuel/1-24.htm">2 Samuel 1:24</a>. The meaning of the word, however, is evidently so generic that it scarcely postulates the rendering "overlay." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> in piel. This occurs in our present verse, as also in a multitude of other places in Chronicles, Kings, Samuel, and Exodus. The radical idea of the verb (kal) is "to be bright." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(d)</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b7;&#x5da;</span> in hiph. This occurs only once (<a href="/1_kings/6-32.htm">1 Kings 6:32</a>). No one of these verbs in itself bespeaks certainly of which or what kind the overlaying might be, unless it be the last, the analogy of which certainly points to the sense of a thin <span class="accented">spreading.</span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_chronicles/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The answer of King Hiram; cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/5-7.htm">1 Kings 5:7-11</a>. - Hiram answered &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1514;&#1489;, in a writing, a letter, which he sent to Solomon. In <a href="/1_kings/5-7.htm">1 Kings 5:7</a> Hiram first expresses his joy at Solomon's request, because it was of importance to him to be on a friendly footing with the king of Israel. In the Chronicle his writing begins with the congratulation: because Jahve loveth His people, hath He made thee king over them. Cf. for the expression, <a href="/2_chronicles/9-8.htm">2 Chronicles 9:8</a> and <a href="/1_kings/10-9.htm">1 Kings 10:9</a>. He then, according to both narratives, praises God that He has given David so wise a son. &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-12.htm">2 Chronicles 2:12</a>, means: then he said further. The praise of God is heightened in the Chronicle by Hiram's entering into Solomon's religious ideas, calling Jahve the Creator of heaven and earth. Then, further, &#1495;&#1499;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1503; is strengthened by &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492; &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1500; &#1497;&#1493;&#1491;&#1506;, having understanding and discernment; and this predicate is specially referred to Solomon's resolve to build a temple to the Lord. Then in <a href="/2_chronicles/2-13.htm">2 Chronicles 2:13</a>. he promises to send Solomon the artificer Huram-Abi. On the title &#1488;&#1489;&#1497;, my father, i.e., minister, counsellor, and the descent of this man, cf. the commentary on <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/7-13.htm">1 Kings 7:13-14</a>. In <a href="/2_chronicles/2-14.htm">2 Chronicles 2:14</a> of the Chronicle his artistic skill is described in terms coinciding with Solomon's wish in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-6.htm">2 Chronicles 2:6</a>, only heightened by small additions. To the metals as materials in which he could work, there are added stone and wood work, and to the woven fabrics &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509; (byssus), the later word for &#1513;&#1473;&#1513;&#1473;; and finally, to exhaust the whole, he is said to be able &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1502;&#1495; &#1493;&#1500;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;, to devise all manner of devices which shall be put to him, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/31-4.htm">Exodus 31:4</a>, he being thus raised to the level of Bezaleel, the chief artificer of the tabernacle. &#1506;&#1501;&#1470;&#1495;&#1499;&#1502;&#1497;&#1498; is dependent upon &#1500;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1514;, as in <a href="/2_chronicles/2-6.htm">2 Chronicles 2:6</a>. The promise to send cedars and cypresses is for the sake of brevity here omitted, and only indirectly indicated in <a href="/2_chronicles/2-16.htm">2 Chronicles 2:16</a>. In <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-15.htm">2 Chronicles 2:15</a>, however, it is mentioned that Hiram accepted the promised supply of grain, wine, and oil for the labourers; and <a href="/2_chronicles/2-16.htm">2 Chronicles 2:16</a> closes with the promise to fell the wood required in Lebanon, and to cause it to be sent in floats to Joppa (Jaffa), whence Solomon could take it up to Jerusalem. The word &#1510;&#1512;&#1498;, "need," is a &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be; &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. in the Old Testament, but is very common in Aramaic writings. &#1512;&#1508;&#1505;&#1491;&#1493;&#1514;, "floats," too, occurs only here instead of &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;,   <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/5-9.htm">1 Kings 5:9</a>, and its etymology is unknown. If we compare <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/5-13.htm">1 Kings 5:13-16</a> with the parallel account in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/5-8.htm">1 Kings 5:8-11</a>, we find that, besides Hiram's somewhat verbose promise to fell the desired quantity of cedars and cypresses on Lebanon, and to send them in floats by sea to the place appointed by Solomon, the latter contains a request from Hiram that Solomon would give him &#1500;&#1495;&#1501;, maintenance for his house, and a concluding remark that Hiram sent Solomon cedar wood, while Solomon gave Hiram, year by year, 20,000 kor of wheat as food for his house, i.e., the royal household, and twenty kor beaten oil, that is, of the finest oil. In the book of Kings, therefore, the promised wages of grain, wine, and oil, which were sent to the Tyrian woodcutters, is passed over, and only the quantity of wheat and finest oil which Solomon gave to the Tyrian king for his household, year by year, in return for the timber sent, is mentioned. In the Chronicle, on the contrary, only the wages or payment to the woodcutters is mentioned, and the return made for the building timber is not spoken of; but there is no reason for bringing these two passages, which treat of different things, into harmony by alterations of the text. For further discussion of this and of the measures, see on <a href="/1_kings/5-11.htm">1 Kings 5:11</a>. </body></html>
