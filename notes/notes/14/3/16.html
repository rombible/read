Blessed be God, the Scriptures are enough to render the man of God thoroughly furnished for every good work. Let us search the Scriptures daily, beseeching the Lord to enable us to understand, believe, and obey his word, that our work and our way may be made plain, and that all may be begun, continued, and ended in him.

The Heb. word <span class="ital">děbîr</span> was translated “oracle” because it was supposed to be derived from a word meaning “to speak.” It means, however, simply “the hindmost part” of the house (cf. <a href="/2_chronicles/4-20.htm" title="Moreover the candlesticks with their lamps, that they should burn after the manner before the oracle, of pure gold;">2 Chronicles 4:20</a>, <a href="/2_chronicles/5-7.htm" title="And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD to his place, to the oracle of the house, into the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubim:">2 Chronicles 5:7</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/5-9.htm" title="And they drew out the staves of the ark, that the ends of the staves were seen from the ark before the oracle; but they were not seen without.

Though the writer of Chronicles has not in this description mentioned any chains as appertaining to the oracle, yet they are mentioned in the parallel. The selection of what is said has in our present text so much the appearance of haste, that this may account for the abrupt appearance of the allusion here. Otherwise the words, "in the oracle," tempt us to fear some corruptness of text, scarcely safely removed by Bertheau's suggestion to substitute <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;</span> ("ring") for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span> ("oracle"). <span class="cmt_word">An hundred pomegranates</span> (comp. <a href="/2_chronicles/4-13.htm">2 Chronicles 4:13</a>; <a href="/1_kings/7-15.htm">1 Kings 7:15, 18, 20</a>).

The plur. &#1497;&#1510;&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, "they overlaid them," is indefinite. The length of the wings was five cubits, and the four outspread wings extended across the whole width of the most holy place from one wall to the other.

And, moreover, the succeeding clause is introduced by &#1493;&#1492;&#1501;, just because in the first clause the wings, and not the cherubim, were the subject.
