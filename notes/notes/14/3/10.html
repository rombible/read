Full instructions enable us to go about our work with certainty and to proceed therein with comfort. Blessed be God, the Scriptures are enough to render the man of God thoroughly furnished for every good work. Let us search the Scriptures daily, beseeching the Lord to enable us to understand, believe, and obey his word, that our work and our way may be made plain, and that all may be begun, continued, and ended in him.

The porch which was before (i.e., in front of) the length (of the house), was twenty cubits before the breadth of the house, i.e., was as broad as the house. So understood, the words give an intelligible sense. &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1498; with the article refers back to &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1498; in <a href="/2_chronicles/3-3.htm">2 Chronicles 3:3</a> (the length of the house), and &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; in the two defining clauses means "in front;" but in the first clause it is "lying in front of the house," i.e., built in front; in the second it is "measured across the front of the breadth of the house." <p>(Note: There is consequently no need to alter the text according to <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/6-3.htm">1 Kings 6:3</a>, from which passage Berth. would interpolate the words &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493; &#1506;&#1500; &#1512;&#1495;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493; &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; &#1512; &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512; &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; between &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; and &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1498;, and thereby get the signification: "and the porch which is before the house, ten cubits is its breadth before the same, and the length which is before the breadth twenty cubits." But this conjecture is neither necessary nor probable. It is not necessary, for (1) the present text gives an intelligible sense; (2) the assertion that the length and breadth of the porch must be stated cannot be justified, if for no other reason, for this, that even of the main buildings all three dimensions are not given, only two being stated, and that it was not the purpose of the author of the Chronicle to give an architecturally complete statement, his main anxiety being to supply a general idea of the splendour of the temple. It is not probable; because the chronicler, if he had followed <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/6-3.htm">1 Kings 6:3</a>, would not have written &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493;, but &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;, and instead of &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1498; would have written &#1493;&#1506;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, to correspond with &#1512;&#1495;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;.)<p>There is certainly either a corruption of the text, or a wrong number in the statement of the height of the porch, 120 cubits; for a front 120 cubits high to a house only thirty cubits high could not be called &#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1501;; it would have been a &#1502;&#1490;&#1491;&#1468;&#1500;, a tower. It cannot with certainty be determined whether we should read twenty or thirty cubits; see in <a href="/1_kings/6-3.htm">1 Kings 6:3</a>.
