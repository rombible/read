It must be in the place David had prepared, not only which he had purchased, but which he had fixed on by Divine direction. Full instructions enable us to go about our work with certainty and to proceed therein with comfort. Blessed be God, the Scriptures are enough to render the man of God thoroughly furnished for every good work. Let us search the Scriptures daily, beseeching the Lord to enable us to understand, believe, and obey his word, that our work and our way may be made plain, and that all may be begun, continued, and ended in him. Beholding God, in Christ, his true Temple, more glorious than that of Solomon's, may we become a spiritual house, a habitation of God through the Spirit.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Their faces were inward - literally, as in the margin. Instead of looking toward one another, with heads bent downward over the mercy Seat, like the cherubim of Moses <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/37-9.htm">Exodus 37:9</a>, these of Solomon looked out from the sanctuary into the great chamber ("the house").

The two placed in the temple were made of olive wood, overlaid with gold. They were of colossal size, like the Assyrian sculptures; for each, with expanded wings, covered a space of ten cubits in height and length&#8212;two wings touched each other, while the other two reached the opposite walls; their faces were inward, that is, towards the most holy house, conformably to their use, which was to veil the ark.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Heb.

The position of these cherubim, both as to wings and faces, was clearly different from that of those for the tabernacle of Moses. There they "cover the mercy-seat with their wings, and their faces are one to another...  toward the mercy-seat were the faces of the cherubim" (<a href="/exodus/25-20.htm">Exodus 25:20</a>; <a href="/exodus/37-9.htm">Exodus 37:9</a>). May this alteration in the time of Solomon indicate possibly one more advance in the developing outlook of Divine mercy to a whole world? Neither this place nor the parallel makes it certain whether the cherubim, that are here said to stand on their feet, stood on the <span class="accented">ground</span>, as some say they did. As regards those of the tabernacle, the prepositions used in <a href="/exodus/25-18.htm">Exodus 25:18, 19</a> and Exodus 37:7, 8 appear to lay stress on their position being a fixture at and on each extremity of the mercy-seat. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_chronicles/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>And he garnished the house with precious stones for ornament (of the inner sides of the walls); cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-2.htm">1 Chronicles 29:2</a>, on which Bhr on <a href="/1_kings/6-7.htm">1 Kings 6:7</a> appositely remarks, that the ornamenting of the walls with precious stones is very easily credible, since among the things which Solomon brought in quantity from Ophir they are expressly mentioned (<a href="/1_kings/10-11.htm">1 Kings 10:11</a>), and it was a common custom in the East so to employ them in buildings and in vessels; cf.

This, the name of a place rich in gold, does not elsewhere occur, and has not as yet been satisfactorily explained. Gesen. with Wilson compares the Sanscrit parvam, the first, foremost, and takes it to be the name of the foremost, i.e., eastern regions; others hold the word to be the name of some city in southern or eastern Arabia, whence Indian gold was brought to Palestine. - In <a href="/2_chronicles/3-7.htm">2 Chronicles 3:7</a> the garnishing of the house with gold is more exactly and completely described. He garnished the house, the beams (of the roof), the thresholds (of the doors), and its walls and its doors with gold, and carved cherubs on the walls.
