Full instructions enable us to go about our work with certainty and to proceed therein with comfort. Blessed be God, the Scriptures are enough to render the man of God thoroughly furnished for every good work. Let us search the Scriptures daily, beseeching the Lord to enable us to understand, believe, and obey his word, that our work and our way may be made plain, and that all may be begun, continued, and ended in him.

This rendering is wrong. The verb is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> given above (ver. 4). It is repeated in the next clause of this very verse as "overlaid," as also in vers. 7, 8, 9. The generic word "covered" would serve all the occasions on which the word occurs here. From a comparison of the parallel it becomes plain that the meaning is that the crone structure of floor and walls was covered over with wood (<a href="/1_kings/6-7.htm">1 Kings 6:7, 15, 18</a>). That wood for the floor was <span class="accented">fir</span> (<a href="/1_kings/6-15.htm">1 Kings 6:15</a>), probably slim for the <span class="accented">walls</span>, which must depend partly on the translation of this ver. 15. It would seem to say that (beside the stone) there was an inner stratum, both to walls and floor, of <span class="accented">cedar</span> (reason for which would be easy of conjecture). But another translation obviates the necessity of this inner stratum supposition, rendering "from the floor to the top of the wall." According to this, while the overlaying gold was on cedar for walls and ceiling (<a href="/1_kings/6-9.htm">1 Kings 6:9</a>), it was on fir for the floor, which does <span class="accented">not seem what our</span> present verse purports, unless, according to the suggestion of some, "fir" be interpreted to include cedar. <span class="cmt_word">Set thereon palm trees and chains</span>. These were, of course, <span class="accented">carvings.</span> The <span class="accented">chains</span>, not mentioned in the parallel (<a href="/1_kings/6-29.htm">1 Kings 6:29</a>; but see 1 Kings 7:17), were probably wreaths of chain design or pattern. Easier modern English would read "put thereon." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_chronicles/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In <a href="/2_chronicles/2-17.htm">2 Chronicles 2:17</a> and <a href="/2_chronicles/2-18.htm">2 Chronicles 2:18</a> the short statement in <a href="/2_chronicles/2-2.htm">2 Chronicles 2:2</a> as to Solomon's statute labourers is again taken up and expanded. Solomon caused all the men to be numbered who dwelt in the land of Israel as strangers, viz., the descendants of the Canaanites who were not exterminated, "according to the numbering (&#1505;&#1508;&#1512; occurs only here) as his father David had numbered them." This remark refers to <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-2.htm">1 Chronicles 22:2</a>, where, however, it is only said that David commanded the strangers to be assembled. But as he caused them to be assembled in order to secure labourers for the building of the temple, he doubtless caused them to be numbered; and to this reference is here made. The numbering gave a total of 153,000 men, of whom 70,000 were made bearers of burdens, 80,000 &#1495;&#1510;&#1489;, i.e., probably hewers of stone and wood &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1512;, i.e., on Lebanon, and 3600 foremen or overseers over the workmen, &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492;&#1506;&#1501; &#1500;&#1492;&#1506;&#1489;&#1497;&#1491;, to cause the people to work, that is, to hold them to their task. With this cf. <a href="/1_kings/5-15.htm">1 Kings 5:15</a>., where the number of the overseers is stated at 3300. This difference is explained by the fact that in the Chronicle the total number of overseers, of higher and lower rank, is given, while in the book of Kings only the number of overseers of the lower rank is given without the higher overseers. Solomon had in all 550 higher overseers of the builders (Israelite and Canaanite), - cf. <a href="/1_kings/9-23.htm">1 Kings 9:23</a>; and of these, 250 were Israelites, who alone are mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-10.htm">2 Chronicles 8:10</a>, while the remaining 300 were Canaanites. The total number of overseers is the same in both accounts, - 3850; who are divided in the Chronicle into 3600 Canaanitish and 250 Israelitish, in the book of Kings into 3300 lower and 550 higher overseers (see on <a href="/1_kings/5-16.htm">1 Kings 5:16</a>). It is, moreover, stated in <a href="/1_kings/5-12.htm">1 Kings 5:12</a>. that Solomon had levied a force of 30,000 statute labourers from among the people of Israel, with the design that a third part of them, that is, 10,000 men, should labour alternately for a month at a time in Lebanon, looking after their own affairs at home during the two following months. This levy of workmen from among the people of Israel is not mentioned in the Chronicle. </body></html>
