Six hundred talents.</span> It is impossible to assert with any accuracy the money value intended here. Six hundred talents of gold is an amazing proportion of the yearly revenue of 666 talents of gold, spoken of in <a href="/1_kings/10-14.htm">1 Kings 10:14</a>. This latter amount is worth, in Keil's estimate, about three million and three quarters of our money, but in Peele's estimate nearer double that! The Hebrew, Phoenician, and Assyrian unit of weight is the same, and one quite different from the Egyptian.

But the <span class="accented">gold</span> talent con-rained 100 manehs, the maneh 100 shekels, and the shekel 132 grains, making this gold talent the equivalent of 10,000 shekels, or 1,320,000 grains. The "holy shekel," or "shekel of the sanctuary," could be either of gold or silver (<a href="/exodus/38-4.htm">Exodus 38:4, 5</a>). (For some treatment of this still unsatisfactory subject, see Dr. Smith's .

The statements as to the place where the temple was built (<a href="/2_chronicles/3-1.htm">2 Chronicles 3:1</a>) are found here only. Mount Moriah is manifestly the mountain in the land of Moriah where Abraham was to have sacrificed his son Isaac (<a href="/genesis/22-2.htm">Genesis 22:2</a>), which had received the name &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, i.e., "the appearance of Jahve," from that event. It is the mountain which lies to the north-east of Zion, now called Haram after the most sacred mosque of the Mohammedans, which is built there; cf. Rosen, das Haram von Jerusalem, Gotha 1866. &#1500;&#1491; &#1504;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; is usually translated: "which was pointed out to David his father." But &#1512;&#1488;&#1492; has not in Niphal the signification "to be pointed out," which is peculiar to the Hophal (cf. <a href="/exodus/25-40.htm">Exodus 25:40</a>; <a href="/exodus/26-30.htm">Exodus 26:30</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-35.htm">Deuteronomy 4:35</a>, etc.); it means only "to be seen," "to let oneself be seen," to appear, especially used of appearances of God. It cannot be shown to be anywhere used of a place which lets itself be seen, or appears to one. We must therefore translate: "on mount Moriah, where He had appeared to David his father." The unexpressed subject &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; is easily supplied from the context; and with &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1512;, "on the mountain where," cf. &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1511;&#1493;&#1501;, <a href="/genesis/35-13.htm">Genesis 35:13</a>., and Ew. 331, c, 3. &#1492;&#1499;&#1497;&#1503; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; is separated from what precedes, and connected with what follows, by the Athnach under &#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;, and is translated, after the lxx, Vulg., and Syr., as a hyperbaton thus: "in the place where David had prepared," scil. the building of the temple by the laying up of the materials there (<a href="/1_chronicles/22-5.htm">1 Chronicles 22:5</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/29-2.htm">1 Chronicles 29:2</a>). But there are no proper analogies to such a hyperbaton, since <a href="/jeremiah/14-1.htm">Jeremiah 14:1</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/46-1.htm">Jeremiah 46:1</a> are differently constituted. Berth. therefore is of opinion that our text can only signify, "which temple he prepared on the place of David," and that this reading cannot be the original, because &#1492;&#1499;&#1497;&#1503; occurs elsewhere only of David's activity in preparing for the building of the temple, and "place of David" cannot, without further ceremony, mean the place which David had chosen. He would therefore transpose the words thus: &#1491;&#1493;&#1497;&#1491; &#1492;&#1499;&#1497;&#1503; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1511;&#1493;&#1501;. But this conjecture is by no means certain. In the first place, the mere transposition of the words is not sufficient; we must also alter &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1511;&#1493;&#1501; into &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1511;&#1493;&#1501;, to get the required sense; and, further, Bertheau's reasons are not conclusive. &#1492;&#1499;&#1497;&#1503; means not merely to make ready for (zursten), to prepare, but also to make ready, make (bereiten), found e.g., <a href="/1_kings/6-19.htm">1 Kings 6:19</a>; <a href="/ezra/3-3.htm">Ezra 3:3</a>; and the frequent use of this word in reference to David's action in preparing for the building of the temple does not prove that it has this signification here also. The clause may be quite well translated, with J. J. Rambach: "quam domum praeparavit (Salomo) in loco Davidis." The expression "David's place," for "place which David had fixed upon," cannot in this connection be misunderstood, but yet it cannot be denied that the clause is stiff and constrained if we refer it to &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;. We would therefore prefer to give up the Masoretic punctuation, and construe the words otherwise, connecting &#1492;&#1499;&#1497;&#1503; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; with the preceding thus: where Jahve had appeared to his father David, who had prepared (the house, i.e., the building of it), and make &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1511;&#1493;&#1501; &#1491;, with the following designation of the place, to depend upon &#1500;&#1489;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; as a further explanation of the &#1492;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1512;, viz., in the place of David, i.e., on the place fixed by David on the threshing-floor of the Jebusite Ornan; cf. <a href="/1_chronicles/21-18.htm">1 Chronicles 21:18</a>. - In <a href="/2_chronicles/3-2.htm">2 Chronicles 3:2</a> &#1500;&#1489;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1495;&#1500; is repeated in order to fix the time of the building. In <a href="/1_kings/6-1.htm">1 Kings 6:1</a> the time is fixed by its relation to the exodus of the Israelites from Egypt. &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;, which the older commentators always understood of the second day of the month, is strange. Elsewhere the day of the month is always designated by the cardinal number with the addition of &#1500;&#1495;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; or &#1497;&#1493;&#1501;, the month having been previously given. Berth. therefore considers &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497; to be a gloss which has come into the text by a repetition of &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;, since the lxx and Vulg. have not expressed it. </body></html>
