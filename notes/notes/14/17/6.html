The public teaching of the word of God forms, in all ages, the great method of promoting the power of godliness. Thereby the understanding is informed, the conscience is awakened and directed. We have a particular account of Jehoshaphat's prosperity. But it was not his formidable army that restrained the neighbouring nations from attempting any thing against Israel, but the fear of God which fell upon them, when Jehoshaphat reformed his country, and set up a preaching ministry in it. The ordinances of God are more the strength and safety of a kingdom, than soldiers and weapons of war. The Bible requires use to notice the hand of God in every event, yet this is little regarded. But let all employ the talents they have: be faithful, even in that which is little. Set up the worship of God in your houses. The charge of a family is important. Why should you not instruct them as Jehoshaphat did his subjects, in the book of the law of the Lord. But be consistent. Do not recommend one thing, and practise another. Begin with yourselves. Seek to the Lord God of Israel, then call upon children and servants to follow your example.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>His heart was lifted up - This expression generally occurs in a bad sense <a href="/deuteronomy/8-14.htm">Deuteronomy 8:14</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/26-16.htm">2 Chronicles 26:16</a>; <a href="/psalms/131-1.htm">Psalm 131:1</a>; <a href="/proverbs/18-12.htm">Proverbs 18:12</a>; but here it must be taken differently.

And they laid him upon the bed, which had been filled with spices (&#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, see <a href="/exodus/30-23.htm">Exodus 30:23</a>), and those of various kinds, mixed for an anointing mixture, prepared. &#1494;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; from &#1494;&#1503;, kind, species; &#1493;&#1468;&#1494;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, et varia quidem. &#1502;&#1512;&#1511;&#1468;&#1495; in Piel only here, properly spiced, from &#1512;&#1511;&#1495;, to spice, usually to compound an unguent of various spices. &#1502;&#1512;&#1511;&#1495;&#1514;, the compounding of ointment; so also <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-30.htm">1 Chronicles 9:30</a>, where it is usually translated by unguent. &#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;, work, manufacture, is a shortened terminus technicus for &#1512;&#1493;&#1511;&#1495; &#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;, manufacture of the ointment-compounder (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/30-25.htm">Exodus 30:25</a>, <a href="/exodus/30-35.htm">Exodus 30:35</a>), and the conjecture that &#1512;&#1493;&#1511;&#1495; has been dropped out of the text by mistake is unnecessary. "And they kindled for him a great, very great burning," cf. <a href="/2_chronicles/21-19.htm">2 Chronicles 21:19</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-5.htm">Jeremiah 34:5</a>, whence we gather that the kindling of a burning, i.e., the burning of odorous spices, was customary at the burials of kings. Here it is only remarked that at Asa's funeral an extraordinary quantity of spices was burnt. A burning of the corpse, or of the bed or clothes of the dead, is not to be thought of here: the Israelites were in the habit of burying their dead, not of burning them. That occurred only in extraordinary circumstances-as, for example, in the case of the bodies of Saul and his sons; see on <a href="/1_samuel/31-12.htm">1 Samuel 31:12</a>. The kindling and burning of spices at the solemn funerals of persons of princely rank, on the other hand, occurred also among other nations, e.g., among the Romans; cf. Plinii hist. nat. xii. 18, and M. Geier, de luctu Hebr. c. 6. </body></html>
