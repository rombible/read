But after God had done such great things for him, given him not only victory, but wealth; after this, to go and join himself with a wicked king, was very ungrateful. What could he expect but that God would be angry with him? Yet it seems, he took the warning; for when Ahaziah afterward pressed him to join him, he would not, 1Ki 22:49. Thus the alliance was broken, and the Divine rebuke had its effect, at least for a season. Let us be thankful for any losses which may have prevented the loss of our immortal souls. Let us praise the Lord, who sought after us, and left us not to perish in our sins.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Who is mentioned ... - Words which are now generally thought to mean "whose work was inserted into the Book of the Kings."<p>Of Israel - "Israel" is probably used here inexactly for "Judah" (compare <a href="/2_chronicles/12-6.htm">2 Chronicles 12:6</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-2.htm">2 Chronicles 21:2</a>, <a href="/2_chronicles/21-4.htm">2 Chronicles 21:4</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/20.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>33. the high places were not taken away&#8212;Those on which idolatry was practised were entirely destroyed (2Ch 17:6); but those where the people, notwithstanding the erection of the temple, continued to worship the true God, prudence required to be slowly and gradually abolished, in deference to popular prejudice.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/20.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_chronicles/20.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last,....

Thence they joyfully returned, with Jehoshaphat at their head, to Jerusalem, and went up, the Levites and priests performing solemn music, to the house of God, to render further thanks to the Lord for His wondrous help (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-27.htm">2 Chronicles 20:27</a>.). The ancient name &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1499;&#1492; still exists in the Wady Bereikut, to the west of Tekoa, near the road which leads from Hebron to Jerusalem. "A wide, open valley, and upon its west side, on a small rising ground, are the ruins of Bereikut, which cover from three to four acres" (Robinson's New Biblical Researches, and Phys. Geogr. S. 106; cf. v. de Velde, Memoir, p. 292). Jerome makes mention of the place in Vita Paulae, where he narrates that Paula, standing in supercilio Caphar baruca, looked out thence upon the wide desert, and the former land of Sodom and Gomorrah (cf. Reland, Pal. illustr. pp. 356 and 685). There is no ground, on the other hand, for the identification of the valley of blessing with the upper part of the valley of Kidron, which, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/joel/3-2.htm">Joel 3:2</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/joel/3-12.htm">Joel 3:12</a>, received the name of Valley of Jehoshaphat (see on <a href="/joel/3-2.htm">Joel 3:2</a>). - On <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-27.htm">2 Chronicles 20:27</a>, cf. <a href="/ezra/6-22.htm">Ezra 6:22</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/12-43.htm">Nehemiah 12:43</a>. </body></html>
