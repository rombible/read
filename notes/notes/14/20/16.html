'the Ascent of the Sun<span class="accented"></span>," or, "of Heres." The following extract from Keil, with its quotations from Robinson, is interesting. "The wilderness Jezreel was without doubt the name of a part of the great stretch of fiat country bounded on the south by the Waddy El Ghar, and extending from the Dead Sea to the neighbourhood of Tekoa, which is now called <span class="accented">El</span> <span class="accented">Hassasah</span>, after a waddy on its northern side. The whole country on the west side of the Dead Sea," where it does not consist of mountain ridges or deep valleys, is high table-land sloping gradually towards the east, wholly waste, merely covered here and there by a few bushes and without the slightest trace of having ever been cultivated' (Robinson's 'Palest.,' <span class="accented">sub voce</span>). Our present ascent of Ziz, or Hazziz, has perhaps remained in the Waddy El Hassasah Robinson takes it to be the pass, which at present leads from Ain-jiddy to the table-land. Yet it is described by him as a 'fearful pass,' and it can hardly be thought of here even if the enemy like the Bedouins, now when on their forays, may be supposed to have marched along the shore of the sea, and ascended to the tableland only at Engedi; for the Israelites did not meet the enemy in this ascent, but <span class="accented">above</span> upon the table-land." Josephus translates <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e6;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e6;</span> by <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>, but with no legitimate justification. <span class="cmt_word">The end of the brook</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> rather the end of the brook-way, or course of the brook when there was water to make one. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_chronicles/20.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>&#1493;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;, and now, the contrary of this has occurred.
