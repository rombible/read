Faith inspires a man with true courage; nor will any thing help more to the establishing of the heart in shaking times, than a firm belief of the power, and mercy, and promise of God. In all our trust in the Lord, and our praises of him, let us especially look at his everlasting mercy to sinners through Jesus Christ. Never was an army so destroyed as that of the enemy. Thus God often makes wicked people destroy one another.

Jehoshaphat and his people found the field strewed with dead bodies, so that they had not to fight at all, but rather to take possession of an immense booty, the collection of which occupied three days. On the fourth they set out on their return to Jerusalem in the same order and joyful mood as they came.

Who are here meant cannot be ascertained with certainty. Some of the older commentators, Ew. and Berth., think it refers to powers, angels sent by God, who are called insidiatores, because of the work they had to do in the army of the hostile peoples. But the passages where the interposition of heavenly powers is spoken of are different (cf. <a href="/2_kings/6-17.htm">2 Kings 6:17</a>; <a href="/2_kings/19-35.htm">2 Kings 19:35</a>), and it is not probable that heavenly powers would be called &#1502;&#1488;&#1512;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501;. Most probably earthly liers in wait are meant, who unexpectedly rushed forth from their ambush upon the hostile army, and raised a panic terror among them; so that, as is narrated in <a href="/2_chronicles/20-23.htm">2 Chronicles 20:23</a>., the Ammonites and Moabites first turned their weapons against the inhabitants of Mount Seir, and after they had exterminated them, began to exterminate each other. But the ambush cannot have been composed of men of Judah, because they were, according to <a href="/2_chronicles/20-15.htm">2 Chronicles 20:15</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-17.htm">2 Chronicles 20:17</a>, not to fight, but only to behold the deliverance wrought by the Lord. Probably it was liers in wait of the Seirites, greedy of spoil, who from an ambush made an attack upon the Ammonites and Moabites, and by the divine leading put the attacked in such fear and confusion, that they turned furiously upon the inhabitants of Mount Seir, who marched with them, and then fell to fighting with each other; just as, in <a href="/judges/7-22.htm">Judges 7:22</a>., the Midianites were, under divine influence, so terrified by the unexpected attack of the small band led by Gideon, that they turned their swords against and mutually destroyed each other. &#1513;&#1474; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1497; &#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1499;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501;, and when they had come to an end (were finished) among the inhabitants of Seir, when they had massacred these, they helped the one against the other to destruction (&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1497;&#1514; is a substantive, as <a href="/2_chronicles/22-4.htm">2 Chronicles 22:4</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-16.htm">Ezekiel 5:16</a>, etc.). </body></html>
