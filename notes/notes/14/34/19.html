Happy and wise are those who seek the Lord and prepare for usefulness at an early age, when others are pursuing sinful pleasures, contracting bad habits, and forming ruinous connexions. Who can express the anguish prevented by early piety, and its blessed effects? Diligent self-examination and watchfulness will convince us of the deceitfulness and wickedness of our own hearts, and the sinfulness of our lives. We are here encouraged to humble ourselves before God, and to seek unto him, as Josiah did. And believers are here taught, not to fear death, but to welcome it, when it takes them away from the evil to come. Nothing hastens the ruin of a people, nor ripens them for it, more than their disregard of the attempts made for their reformation. Be not deceived, God is not mocked. The current and tide of affections only turns at the command of Him who raises up those that are dead in trespasses and sins. We behold peculiar loveliness, in the grace the Lord bestows on those, who in tender years seek to know and to love the Saviour. Hath Jesus, the Day-spring from on high, visited you? Can you trace your knowledge of this light and life of man, like Josiah, from your youth? Oh the unspeakable happiness of becoming acquainted with Jesus from our earliest years!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/34.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Of the Levites there were scribes - Hereto the word "scribe" has never been used to designate a class (compare <a href="/1_kings/4-3.htm">1 Kings 4:3</a>). But here an order of scribes, forming a distinct division of the Levitical body, has been instituted. The class itself probably originated in the reign of Hezekiah (compare <a href="/proverbs/25-1.htm">Proverbs 25:1</a>); and it is probably to the rise of this class that we are indebted for the preservation of so many prophecies belonging to Hezekiah's time, while the works of almost all previous prophets - Ahijah, Iddo, Shemaiah, Jehu, the son of Hanani, and probably many others - have perished. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/34.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2Ch 34:19-33.

The &#1493; before &#1492;&#1505; &#1506;&#1500; appears certainly to go against this interpretation, and Berth. would consequently erase it to connect &#1492;&#1505;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; &#1506;&#1500; with the preceding verse, and begin a new sentence with &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1504;&#1510;&#1468;&#1495;&#1497;&#1501;: "and they led all the workmen."

We hold the text to be correct, and make the w before &#1492;&#1505; &#1506;&#1500; correspond to the &#1493; before &#1502;&#1504;&#1510;&#1495;&#1497;&#1501;, in the signification, et - et. The Levites, all who were skilled in instruments of song, were both over the bearers of burdens, and overseeing the workmen, or leading the workmen. Besides, of the Levites were, i.e., still other Levites were, scribes and officers and porters, i.e., were busied about the temple in the discharge of these functions.</body></html>
