Happy and wise are those who seek the Lord and prepare for usefulness at an early age, when others are pursuing sinful pleasures, contracting bad habits, and forming ruinous connexions. Who can express the anguish prevented by early piety, and its blessed effects? Diligent self-examination and watchfulness will convince us of the deceitfulness and wickedness of our own hearts, and the sinfulness of our lives. We are here encouraged to humble ourselves before God, and to seek unto him, as Josiah did. And believers are here taught, not to fear death, but to welcome it, when it takes them away from the evil to come. Nothing hastens the ruin of a people, nor ripens them for it, more than their disregard of the attempts made for their reformation. Be not deceived, God is not mocked. The current and tide of affections only turns at the command of Him who raises up those that are dead in trespasses and sins. We behold peculiar loveliness, in the grace the Lord bestows on those, who in tender years seek to know and to love the Saviour. Hath Jesus, the Day-spring from on high, visited you? Can you trace your knowledge of this light and life of man, like Josiah, from your youth? Oh the unspeakable happiness of becoming acquainted with Jesus from our earliest years!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/34.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The writer has characteristically substituted "Levites" for the "prophets" of <a href="/2_kings/23-2.htm">2 Kings 23:2</a>. No doubt Josiah was accompanied by priests, prophets, and Levites, but the writer of Kings thought it enough to mention the two former, and merged the Levites in the mass of the people. The writer of Chronicles, on the other hand, thinks the presence of Levites too important to he omitted, and as the prophets could be but few in number, passes them over. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/34.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2Ch 34:19-33.

Instead of Abdon ben Micah (<a href="/2_chronicles/34-20.htm">2 Chronicles 34:20</a>) we find in 2 Kings chbor ben Micayahu, perhaps the correct reading. In <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-21.htm">2 Chronicles 34:21</a>, the expression, "and for those that are left in Israel and Judah," i.e., for the remainder of the people who were left in Israel after the destruction of the kingdom, and in Judah after the divine chastisements inflicted, mainly by the Assyrians under Hezekiah and Manasseh, is clearer and more significant than that in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/22-13.htm">2 Kings 22:13</a>, "and for the people, and for all Judah." &#1504;&#1514;&#1468;&#1499;&#1492;, to pour itself forth (of anger), is quite as suitable as &#1504;&#1510;&#1468;&#1514;&#1492;, inflame, kindle itself, in <a href="/2_kings/22-13.htm">2 Kings 22:13</a>.

The names of the ancestors of the prophetess Huldah also are somewhat different. &#1499;&#1468;&#1494;&#1488;&#1514;, as the king had said to him, is omitted in 2 Kings.
