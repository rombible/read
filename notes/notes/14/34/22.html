Happy and wise are those who seek the Lord and prepare for usefulness at an early age, when others are pursuing sinful pleasures, contracting bad habits, and forming ruinous connexions. Who can express the anguish prevented by early piety, and its blessed effects? Diligent self-examination and watchfulness will convince us of the deceitfulness and wickedness of our own hearts, and the sinfulness of our lives. We are here encouraged to humble ourselves before God, and to seek unto him, as Josiah did. And believers are here taught, not to fear death, but to welcome it, when it takes them away from the evil to come. Nothing hastens the ruin of a people, nor ripens them for it, more than their disregard of the attempts made for their reformation. Be not deceived, God is not mocked. The current and tide of affections only turns at the command of Him who raises up those that are dead in trespasses and sins. We behold peculiar loveliness, in the grace the Lord bestows on those, who in tender years seek to know and to love the Saviour. Hath Jesus, the Day-spring from on high, visited you? Can you trace your knowledge of this light and life of man, like Josiah, from your youth?

It is not clearly implied in the words, that he found it in the place where the money was laid up. The book of the law which was found is merely characterized as the book of the Mosaic law by the words &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491;&#1470;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;, not necessarily as Moses' autograph. The communication of this discovery by the high priest to the state secretary Shaphan, and by him to the king, is narrated in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-15.htm">2 Chronicles 34:15-18</a>, just as in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/22-8.htm">2 Kings 22:8-10</a>. The statement, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-16.htm">2 Chronicles 34:16</a>, "And Shaphan brought the book to the king," instead of the words, "and Shaphan the &#1505;&#1508;&#1512; came (went) to the king," involves no difference as to the facts; it rather makes the matter clear. For since in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/22-10.htm">2 Kings 22:10</a>, immediately after the statement that Hilkiah gave him the book, it is said that Shaphan read from it to the king, he must have brought it to the king. With this elucidation, both the omission of &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;   (<a href="/2_kings/22-8.htm">2 Kings 22:8</a>), and the insertion of &#1506;&#1493;&#1491; after &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-16.htm">2 Chronicles 34:16</a>, is connected. The main thing, that which it concerned the author of the Chronicle to notice, was the fact that the book of the law which had been discovered was immediately brought and read to the king; while the circumstance that Shaphan, when the book was given him, also opened it and read in it, is omitted, as it had no further results. But since Shaphan did not go to the king merely to bring him the book, but rather, in the first place, to report upon the performance of the commission entrusted to him in respect of the money, this report required to be brought prominently forward by the &#1506;&#1493;&#1491;: He brought the book to the king, and besides, made his report to the king. All that has been committed to thy servants (&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491; &#1504;&#1514;&#1503;), that they do; they have poured out the money, etc. The &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; are not Shaphan and the others mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-8.htm">2 Chronicles 34:8</a>, but in general those who were entrusted with the oversight of the repair of the temple, among whom, indeed, the chief royal officials were not included. After this report there follows in <a href="/2_chronicles/34-18.htm">2 Chronicles 34:18</a> an account of the book which Shaphan had brought, and which, as we were informed in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-16.htm">2 Chronicles 34:16</a>, in anticipation of the event, he gave to the king. </body></html>
