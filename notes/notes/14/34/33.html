But the unreality of these reformations by royal mandate is proved by the relapse which immediately followed upon the death of Josiah. The moral corruption which at this epoch was preying upon the vitals of the nation, and hurrying it swiftly to destruction, is revealed in the pathetic pages of the prophet Jeremiah. (See <a href="/context/jeremiah/11-1.htm" title="The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD saying,">Jeremiah 11:1-23</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/13-27.htm" title="I have seen your adulteries, and your neighings, the lewdness of your prostitution, and your abominations on the hills in the fields.

Happy and wise are those who seek the Lord and prepare for usefulness at an early age, when others are pursuing sinful pleasures, contracting bad habits, and forming ruinous connexions. Who can express the anguish prevented by early piety, and its blessed effects? Diligent self-examination and watchfulness will convince us of the deceitfulness and wickedness of our own hearts, and the sinfulness of our lives. We are here encouraged to humble ourselves before God, and to seek unto him, as Josiah did. And believers are here taught, not to fear death, but to welcome it, when it takes them away from the evil to come. Nothing hastens the ruin of a people, nor ripens them for it, more than their disregard of the attempts made for their reformation. Be not deceived, God is not mocked. The current and tide of affections only turns at the command of Him who raises up those that are dead in trespasses and sins. We behold peculiar loveliness, in the grace the Lord bestows on those, who in tender years seek to know and to love the Saviour. Hath Jesus, the Day-spring from on high, visited you? Can you trace your knowledge of this light and life of man, like Josiah, from your youth? Oh the unspeakable happiness of becoming acquainted with Jesus from our earliest years!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/34.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>All his days they departed not - This must be understood in the letter rather than in the spirit.

Instead of Abdon ben Micah (<a href="/2_chronicles/34-20.htm">2 Chronicles 34:20</a>) we find in 2 Kings chbor ben Micayahu, perhaps the correct reading. In <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-21.htm">2 Chronicles 34:21</a>, the expression, "and for those that are left in Israel and Judah," i.e., for the remainder of the people who were left in Israel after the destruction of the kingdom, and in Judah after the divine chastisements inflicted, mainly by the Assyrians under Hezekiah and Manasseh, is clearer and more significant than that in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/22-13.htm">2 Kings 22:13</a>, "and for the people, and for all Judah." &#1504;&#1514;&#1468;&#1499;&#1492;, to pour itself forth (of anger), is quite as suitable as &#1504;&#1510;&#1468;&#1514;&#1492;, inflame, kindle itself, in <a href="/2_kings/22-13.htm">2 Kings 22:13</a>. In <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-22.htm">2 Chronicles 34:22</a>, those sent with the high priest Hilkiah are briefly designated by the words &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1498; &#1493;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, and whom the king, scil. had sent; in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/22-14.htm">2 Kings 22:14</a>, on the contrary, the individual names are recorded (Ewald, Gramm. 292, b, would supply &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;, after the lxx). The names of the ancestors of the prophetess Huldah also are somewhat different. &#1499;&#1468;&#1494;&#1488;&#1514;, as the king had said to him, is omitted in 2 Kings.

After the preceding designation of these words as "the curses written in the law," any further elucidation was superfluous.
