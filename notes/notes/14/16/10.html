God is displeased when he is distrusted, and when an arm of flesh is relied on, more than his power and goodness. It is foolish to lean on a broken reed, when we have the Rock of ages to rely upon. To convince Asa of his folly, the prophet shows that he, of all men, had no reason to distrust God, who had found him such a powerful Helper. The many experiences we have had of the goodness of God to us, aggravate our distrust of him. But see how deceitful our hearts are! we trust in God when we have nothing else to trust to, when need drives us to him; but when we have other things to stay on, we are apt to depend too much on them. Observe Asa's displeasure at this reproof. What is man, when God leaves him to himself! He that abused his power for persecuting God's prophet, was left to himself, to abuse it further for crushing his own subjects. Two years before he died, Asa was diseased in his feet. Making use of physicians was his duty; but trusting to them, and expecting that from them which was to be had from God only, were his sin and folly. In all conflicts and sufferings we need especially to look to our own hearts, that they may be perfect towards God, by faith, patience, and obedience.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In a prison house - Or, "in the stocks."

This may throw some explanatory, though no exculpatory, light on Asa's wrath and violence towards Hanani; for it probably marks that either some goodly portion of the wiser of the people had anticipated of their own common sense the matter of the message of Hanani the seer, or that they had not failed to follow it with some keenly sympathetic remarks For our Authorized Version, "oppressed," read a stronger verb, as "crushed." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_chronicles/16.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>War with Baasha, and the weakness of Asa's faith. The end of his reign. - <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-1.htm">2 Chronicles 16:1-6</a>. Baasha's invasion of Judah, and Asa's prayer for help to the king of Syria. The statement, "In the thirty-sixth year of the reign of Asa, Baasha the king of Israel came up against Judah," is inaccurate, or rather cannot possibly be correct; for, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/16-8.htm">1 Kings 16:8</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/16-10.htm">1 Kings 16:10</a>, Baasha died in the twenty-sixth year of Asa's reign, and his successor Elah was murdered by Zimri in the second year of his reign, i.e., in the twenty-seventh year of Asa. The older commentators, for the most part, accepted the conjecture that the thirty-fifth year (in <a href="/2_chronicles/15-19.htm">2 Chronicles 15:19</a>) is to be reckoned from the commencement of the kingdom of Judah; and consequently, since Asa became king in the twentieth year of the kingdom of Judah, that Baasha's invasion occurred in the sixteenth year of his reign, and that the land had enjoyed peace till his fifteenth year; cf. Ramb. ad h. l.; des Vignoles, Chronol. i. p. 299. This is in substance correct; but the statement, "in the thirty-sixth year of Asa's kingship," cannot re reconciled with it. For even if we suppose that the author of the Chronicle derived his information from an authority which reckoned from the rise of the kingdom of Judah, yet it could not have been said on that authority, &#1488;&#1505;&#1488; &#1500;&#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;. This only the author of the Chronicle can have written; but then he cannot also have taken over the statement, "in the thirty-sixth year," unaltered from his authority into his book. There remains therefore no alternative but to regard the text as erroneous - the letters &#1500; (30) and &#1497; (10), which are somewhat similar in the ancient Hebrew characters, having been interchanged by a copyist; and hence the <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/35.htm">Numbers 35</a> and 36 have arisen out of the original 15 and 16. By this alteration all difficulties are removed, and all the statements of the Chronicle as to Asa's reign are harmonized. During the first ten years there was peace (<a href="/2_chronicles/14-1.htm">2 Chronicles 14:1</a>); thereafter, in the eleventh year, the inroad of the Cushites; and after the victory over them there was the continuation of the Cultus reform, and rest until the fifteenth year, in which the renewal of the covenant took place (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-19.htm">2 Chronicles 15:19</a>, cf. with <a href="/2_chronicles/15-10.htm">2 Chronicles 15:10</a>); and in the sixteenth year the war with Baasha arose.<p>(Note: Movers, S. 255ff., and Then. on <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/15.htm">1 Kings 15</a>, launch out into arbitrary hypotheses, founded in both cases upon the erroneous presumption that the author of the Chronicle copied our canonical books of Kings - they being his authority-partly misunderstanding and partly altering them.)<p>The account of this war in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-1.htm">2 Chronicles 16:1-6</a> agrees with that in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/15-17.htm">1 Kings 15:17-22</a> almost literally, and has been commented upon in the remarks on <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/15.htm">1 Kings 15</a>. In <a href="/2_chronicles/16-2.htm">2 Chronicles 16:2</a> the author of the Chronicle has mentioned only the main things. Abel-maim, i.e., Abel in the Water (<a href="/2_chronicles/16-4.htm">2 Chronicles 16:4</a>), is only another name for Abel-Beth-Maachah (Kings); see on <a href="/2_samuel/20-14.htm">2 Samuel 20:14</a>. In the same verse &#1504;&#1508;&#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497; &#1506;&#1512;&#1497; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1502;&#1505;&#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; &#1493;&#1488;&#1514; is surprising, "and all magazines (or stores) of the cities of Naphtali," instead of &#1504;&#1508;&#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1506;&#1500; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; &#1488;&#1514;, "all Kinneroth, together with all the land of Naphtali" (Kings). Then. and Berth. think &#1506;&#1512;&#1497; &#1502;&#1505;&#1499;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; has arisen out of &#1488;&#1512;&#1509; and &#1499;&#1504;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; by a misconception of the reading; while Gesen., Dietr. in Lex. sub voce &#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, conjecture that in <a href="/1_kings/15-20.htm">1 Kings 15:20</a> &#1502;&#1505;&#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; should be read instead of &#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;. Should the difference actually be the result only of a misconception, then the latter conjecture would have much more in its favour than the first. But it is a more probable solution of the difficulty that the text of the Chronicle is a translation of the unusual and, especially on account of the &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1504; &#1506;&#1500;, scarcely intelligible &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;. &#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; is the designation of the very fertile district on the west side of the Sea of Kinnereth, i.e., Gennesaret, after which a city also was called &#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514; (see on <a href="/joshua/19-35.htm">Joshua 19:35</a>), and which, on account of its fertility, might be called the granary of the tribal domain of Naphtali. But the smiting of a district can only be a devastation of it, - a plundering and destruction of its produce, both in stores and elsewhere. With this idea the author of the Chronicle, instead of the district Kinnereth, the name of which had perhaps become obsolete in his time, speaks of the &#1502;&#1505;&#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;, the magazines or stores, of the cities of Naphtali. In <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-5.htm">2 Chronicles 16:5</a>, too, we cannot hold the addition &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1499;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1514;, "he caused his work to rest," as Berth. does, for an interpretation of the original reading, &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1512;&#1510;&#1492; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; (Kings), it having become illegible: it is rather a free rendering of the thought that Baasha abandoned his attempt upon Judah. </body></html>
