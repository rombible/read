The mysteries of the true religion, unlike those of the Gentile superstitions, sought not concealment. Solomon endeavoured to possess Huram with great and high thoughts of the God of Israel. We should not be afraid or ashamed to embrace every opportunity to speak of God, and to impress others with a deep sense of the importance of his favour and service. Now that the people of Israel kept close to the law and worship of God, the neighbouring nations were willing to be taught by them in the true religion, as the Israelites had been willing in the days of their apostacy, to be infected with the idolatries and superstitions of their neighbours. A wise and pious king is an evidence of the Lord's special love for his people.

In <a href="/1_kings/5-11.htm">1 Kings 5:11</a> the language is "wheat <span class="accented">for</span> food" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b9;&#x5dc;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;</span>), while the Septuagint gives <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3c1;</span>.

The former Hebrew word is that constantly employed for "plagues," "strokes," etc., and it is nowhere but in this place rendered "beaten." <span class="cmt_word">I will give to thy servants</span>. This passage is hard to reconcile with what is said in <a href="/1_kings/5-11.htm">1 Kings 5:11</a>; but meantime it is not certain that it needs to be reconciled with it. It is possible that the two passages are distinct. The contents of the present verse, at all events, need not be credited with any ambiguity, unless, indeed, we would wish it more definite, whether the expression, "I will give <span class="accented">to</span> thy servants," may not be quite as correctly understood, "<span class="accented">for</span> thy servants," <span class="accented">i.e. to thee as</span> the hire of them. If this be so, it would enable us to give at once <span class="accented">all the wheat</span>, and <span class="accented">two hundred</span> out of the 20,000 baths of oil, for the consumption, not of the literal workmen, but of the royal household. Then this granted, the verse, though not identical with <a href="/1_kings/5-11.htm">1 Kings 5:11</a>, is brought into harmony with it. Reverting to the statement in <a href="/1_kings/5.htm">1 Kings 5</a>, what we learn is that Solomon, in his application to Hiram, offers payment for the hire of his servants such as he shall appoint (ver. 6). Hiram's reply is that he shall be satisfied to receive as payment "food <span class="accented">for his household"</span> (ver. 9), the amount of it and the annual payment of it being specified in ver. 11. This is the whole case, the discrepancies in which are plain, but they do not amount to contradictions. The appearance that is worn on the face of things is that the writer in Chronicles gives what came to be the final arrangement as to remuneration, though confessedly it is placed as much as the account in Kings in the draft of Solomon's original application to Hiram. <span class="cmt_word">Measures</span>. These were cots, and the cot was the same as the homer. From a calculation of some doubtfulness, however, made under the suggestions of <a href="/1_kings/4-22.htm">1 Kings 4:22</a>, it has been said that the consumption of the royal household of <span class="accented">Solomon</span> was above 32,000 measures. The cor, or homer, was the largest of the five dry measures of capacity, being equal to 180 <span class="accented">cabs</span>, 100 <span class="accented">omers</span>, 30 <span class="accented">seahe</span>, 10 <span class="accented">ephahs</span> (see Dr. Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 3.1741), though what was the exact value of any one of these in modern measures has only been uncertainly and very approximately arrived at. <span class="cmt_word">Baths</span>.
