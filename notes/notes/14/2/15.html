The mysteries of the true religion, unlike those of the Gentile superstitions, sought not concealment. Solomon endeavoured to possess Huram with great and high thoughts of the God of Israel. We should not be afraid or ashamed to embrace every opportunity to speak of God, and to impress others with a deep sense of the importance of his favour and service. Now that the people of Israel kept close to the law and worship of God, the neighbouring nations were willing to be taught by them in the true religion, as the Israelites had been willing in the days of their apostacy, to be infected with the idolatries and superstitions of their neighbours. A wise and pious king is an evidence of the Lord's special love for his people. How great then was God's love to his believing people, in giving his only-begotten Son to be their Prince and their Saviour.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>To find out every device - Compare <a href="/exodus/31-4.htm">Exodus 31:4</a>.

It is subordinated to the preceding clauses: send me cedars, which thy people who are skilful in the matter hew, and in that my servants will assist, in order, viz., to prepare me building timber in plenty (the &#1493; is explic).

In return, Solomon promises to supply the Tyrian workmen with grain, wine, and oil for their maintenance - a circumstance which is omitted in <a href="/1_kings/5-10.htm">1 Kings 5:10</a>; see on <a href="/2_chronicles/2-14.htm">2 Chronicles 2:14</a>. &#1500;&#1492;&#1496;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; is more closely defined by &#1492;&#1506;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501; &#1500;&#1499;&#1512;&#1514;&#1497;, and &#1500; is the introductory &#1500;: "and behold, as to the hewers, the fellers of trees." &#1495;&#1496;&#1489;, to hew (wood), and to dress it (<a href="/deuteronomy/29-10.htm">Deuteronomy 29:10</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/9-21.htm">Joshua 9:21</a>, <a href="/joshua/9-23.htm">Joshua 9:23</a>), would seem to have been supplanted by &#1495;&#1510;&#1489;, which in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-2.htm">2 Chronicles 2:2</a>, <a href="/2_chronicles/2-18.htm">2 Chronicles 2:18</a> is used for it, and it is therefore explained by &#1492;&#1506;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501; &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;. "I will give wheat &#1502;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; to thy servants" (the hewers of wood). The word &#1502;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; gives no suitable sense; for "wheat of the strokes," for threshed wheat, would be a very extraordinary expression, even apart from the facts that wheat, which is always reckoned by measure, is as a matter of course supposed to be threshed, and that no such addition is made use of with the barley. &#1502;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; is probably only an orthographical error for &#1502;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;, food, as may be seen from <a href="/1_kings/5-11.htm">1 Kings 5:11</a>. </body></html>
