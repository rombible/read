The mysteries of the true religion, unlike those of the Gentile superstitions, sought not concealment. Solomon endeavoured to possess Huram with great and high thoughts of the God of Israel. We should not be afraid or ashamed to embrace every opportunity to speak of God, and to impress others with a deep sense of the importance of his favour and service. Now that the people of Israel kept close to the law and worship of God, the neighbouring nations were willing to be taught by them in the true religion, as the Israelites had been willing in the days of their apostacy, to be infected with the idolatries and superstitions of their neighbours. A wise and pious king is an evidence of the Lord's special love for his people.

But the parallel gives the mother as a woman "of the tribe of Naphtali," and calls her a "widow." This must mean, either that she was a widow <span class="accented">now</span>, or that she was a widow when "the man of Tyre" married her. If this latter is the correct meaning, it has been suggested that, though the mother was really a woman of the daughters of Dan, yet the husband who, dying, left her a widow, was of the tribe of Naphtali, and that from this <span class="accented">she</span> became credited with belonging to that tribe. It would seem not altogether impossible that it may be intended to state, in a delicate way, that this remarkably able man was the natural son of the widow in question, "the man of Tyre" (not called <span class="accented">her husband</span>) being the father.

(For the identical phrase, see <a href="/exodus/31-4.htm">Exodus 31:4</a>.) The present verse, exceeding in definiteness ver. 7, supra, undoubtedly purports on the face of it to ascribe a very wide range of practical skill, and not merely general administrative and directing skill, to Hiram. Note, however, the significance couched in the last clauses of both verses. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_chronicles/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The infinitive &#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;&#1499;&#1497;&#1503; cannot be regarded as the continuation of &#1500;&#1499;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, nor is it a continuation of the imperat. &#1500;&#1497; &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495; (<a href="/2_chronicles/2-7.htm">2 Chronicles 2:7</a>), with the signification, "and let there be prepared for me" (Berth.). It is subordinated to the preceding clauses: send me cedars, which thy people who are skilful in the matter hew, and in that my servants will assist, in order, viz., to prepare me building timber in plenty (the &#1493; is explic).

"I will give wheat &#1502;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; to thy servants" (the hewers of wood). The word &#1502;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; gives no suitable sense; for "wheat of the strokes," for threshed wheat, would be a very extraordinary expression, even apart from the facts that wheat, which is always reckoned by measure, is as a matter of course supposed to be threshed, and that no such addition is made use of with the barley. &#1502;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; is probably only an orthographical error for &#1502;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;, food, as may be seen from <a href="/1_kings/5-11.htm">1 Kings 5:11</a>. </body></html>
