The mysteries of the true religion, unlike those of the Gentile superstitions, sought not concealment. Solomon endeavoured to possess Huram with great and high thoughts of the God of Israel. We should not be afraid or ashamed to embrace every opportunity to speak of God, and to impress others with a deep sense of the importance of his favour and service. Now that the people of Israel kept close to the law and worship of God, the neighbouring nations were willing to be taught by them in the true religion, as the Israelites had been willing in the days of their apostacy, to be infected with the idolatries and superstitions of their neighbours. A wise and pious king is an evidence of the Lord's special love for his people. How great then was God's love to his believing people, in giving his only-begotten Son to be their Prince and their Saviour.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The symbolic meaning of "burning incense" is indicated in <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/8-3.htm">Revelation 8:3-4</a>.

Solomon sent to Huram&#8212;The correspondence was probably conducted on both sides in writing (2Ch 2:11; also see on [407]1Ki 5:8).<p>As thou didst deal with David my father&#8212;This would seem decisive of the question whether the Huram then reigning in Tyre was David's friend (see on [408]1Ki 5:1-6). In opening the business, Solomon grounded his request for Tyrian aid on two reasons: 1. The temple he proposed to build must be a solid and permanent building because the worship was to be continued in perpetuity; and therefore the building materials must be of the most durable quality. 2. It must be a magnificent structure because it was to be dedicated to the God who was greater than all gods; and, therefore, as it might seem a presumptuous idea to erect an edifice for a Being "whom the heaven and the heaven of heavens do not contain," it was explained that Solomon's object was not to build a house for Him to dwell in, but a temple in which His worshippers might offer sacrifices to His honor. No language could be more humble and appropriate than this.

This sweet incense, compounded of the four ingredients stacte, onycha, galbanum, pure frankincense, was to be burnt morning and evening, at the time of the morning and evening sacrifices on the altar made of shittim wood, overlaid with gold, which stood in the holy place facing the ark. with the table of shewbread on the one hand, and the golden candlestick on the other. While the act of atonement was set forth by the offering of the victim on the brazen altar in the outer court, the ascending, acceptable, and accepted prayer and aspiration of the congregation were expressed by the sweet incense-burning. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="cmt_word">The continual</span> <span class="cmt_word">shew-bread</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5db;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;</span>). The elementary meaning of the word here rendered "shewbread" is "a ranging in order," whether the "order" might be, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, that of an army in battle array (<a href="/1_samuel/4-16.htm">1 Samuel 4:16</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/17-8.htm">1 Samuel 17:8</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/22-48.htm">2 Samuel 22:48</a>), or of the lamps of the holy candlestick (<a href="/exodus/39-37.htm">Exodus 39:37</a>), or of pilings of wood to be burnt on the altar (<a href="/judges/6-26.htm">Judges 6:26</a>), or of cakes of bread, as presumably 'here and in some parallel passages (<a href="/leviticus/24-6.htm">Leviticus 24:6</a>). For the table which was to carry these cakes, see <a href="/exodus/25-23.htm">Exodus 25:23-30</a>; <a href="/exodus/37-10.htm">Exodus 37:10-16</a>; the last verse of the former passage speaking of the shewbread under the name <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b6;&#x5d7;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;&#x20;&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>. (For the position of the table, see <a href="/exodus/26-35.htm">Exodus 26:35</a>.) The word employed in the text is first used to express the piles of cakes, called in our Authorized Version shewbread in <a href="/leviticus/24-6.htm">Leviticus 24:6, 7</a>; then <a href="/1_chronicles/9-32.htm">1 Chronicles 9:32</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/23-29.htm">1 Chronicles 23:29</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/28-16.htm">1 Chronicles 28:16</a>; as also again in <a href="/2_chronicles/13-11.htm">2 Chronicles 13:11</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/29-18.htm">2 Chronicles 29:18</a>; and in <a href="/nehemiah/10-33.htm">Nehemiah 10:33</a>. Where in these passages the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b6;&#x5d7;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;</span> is not expressed, that it is understood may be gathered from the other passages (<a href="/numbers/4-7.htm">Numbers 4:7</a>). The bread consisted of twelve large cakes of unleavened dough (<a href="/leviticus/24-5.htm">Leviticus 24:5-9</a>), ranged in two heaps, and with a golden cup of frankincense (<a href="/leviticus/24-7.htm">Leviticus 24:7</a>) to each pile. When on every seventh day new cakes were substituted, the old ones belonged to the priests (<a href="/leviticus/24-8.htm">Leviticus 24:8, 9</a>; <a href="/leviticus/8-31.htm">Leviticus 8:31</a>; <a href="/matthew/12-4.htm">Matthew 12:4</a>; <a href="/exodus/29-33.htm">Exodus 29:33, 34</a>). The twelve cakes pointed to the twelve tribes. Their size may be judged from the statement that each cake contained two tenth deals, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> two-tenths of an ephah, equal to about six pounds and a quarter. The exact significance of this bread is not stated in Scripture. Part of it lay plainly in the twelve cakes, part, perhaps, in their becoming priest's food, found by the people (<a href="/leviticus/24-8.htm">Leviticus 24:8</a>), after having been presented seven days before the Lord. Much that is interesting but not finally satisfactory on the question may be found in the article "Shewbread" in Dr. Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 3:1271. Our Authorized Version "shewbread' comes from Luther's <span class="accented">Schaubrode.</span> Wickliffe, after the Vulgate <span class="accented">panes propositionis</span>, designates it "the loaves of proposition." The New Testament has, in <a href="/hebrews/9-2.htm">Hebrews 9:2</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>; as also in the Gospels (<a href="/matthew/12-4.htm">Matthew 12:4</a>; <a href="/luke/6-4.htm">Luke 6:4</a>); while the Septuagint has <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> (<a href="/exodus/25-30.htm">Exodus 25:30</a>), and <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="/1_kings/7-48.htm">1 Kings 7:48</a>).

The morning and evening offering were alike, viz. a lamb, a meal offering consisting of a tenth of an ephah of flour, mixed with the fourth part of a bin of beaten oil, and a drink offering consisting of the fourth part of a bin of "wine," or of "strong drink." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> The burnt offering <span class="cmt_word">on the sabbath</span>.

In our Chronicle, on the contrary, we have in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-14.htm">2 Chronicles 1:14-17</a> only a short statement as to his chariots and horses, and the wealth in silver and gold to be found in the land, merely for the purpose of showing how God had given him riches and possessions. This statement recurs verbally in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/10-26.htm">1 Kings 10:26-29</a>, in the concluding remarks on the riches and splendour of Solomon's reign; while in the parallel passage, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-13.htm">2 Chronicles 9:13-28</a>, it is repeated in an abridged form, and interwoven with other statements. From this we see in how free and peculiar a manner the author of the Chronicle has made use of his authorities, and how he has arranged the material derived from them according to his own special plan.<p>(Note: The assertion of Thenius on <a href="/1_kings/10-26.htm">1 Kings 10:26</a>., that he found this section in his authorities in two different places and in different connections, copied them mechanically, and only towards the end of the second passage remarked the repetition and then abridged the statement, is at once refuted by observing, that in the supposed repetition the first half (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-25.htm">2 Chronicles 9:25-26</a>) does not at all agree with <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/10-26.htm">1 Kings 10:26</a>, but coincides with the statement in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/5-6.htm">1 Kings 5:6-7</a>.)<p>For the commentary on this section, see on <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/10-26.htm">1 Kings 10:26-28</a>.<p><a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-14.htm">2 Chronicles 1:14-15</a><p><a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-14.htm">2 Chronicles 1:14</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-15.htm">2 Chronicles 1:15</a>, with the exception of one divergence in form and one in matter, correspond word for word to <a href="/1_kings/10-26.htm">1 Kings 10:26</a> and <a href="/1_kings/10-27.htm">1 Kings 10:27</a>.

It is, however, very suitable in this connection, since the comparison "like stones" has reference to quantity, and Solomon had collected not only silver, but also gold, in quantity.</body></html>
