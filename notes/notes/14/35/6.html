His solemnizing the passover is related here. The Lord's supper resembles the passover more than any other of the Jewish festivals; and the due observance of that ordinance, is a proof of growing piety and devotion. God alone can truly make our hearts holy, and prepare them for his holy services; but there are duties belonging to us, in doing which we obtain this blessing from the Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/35.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Prepare your brethren ... - i. e.

So kill the passover, &c.&#8212;The design of the minute directions given here was to facilitate the distribution of the paschal lambs. These were to be eaten by the respective families according to their numbers (Ex 12:3). But multitudes of the people, especially those from Israel, having been reduced to poverty through the Assyrian devastations, were to be provided with the means of commemorating the passover. Therefore, the king enjoined the Levites that when the paschal lambs were brought to them to be killed (2Ch 35:7-9) they should take care to have everything put in so orderly a train, that the lambs, after due presentation, might be easily delivered to the various families to be roasted and eaten by themselves apart.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/35.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Prepare your brethren, by purifying them, and quickening them to fit themselves for so great and solemn a work. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_chronicles/35.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>So kill the passover,....

The "sons of Israel," as distinguished from the inhabitants of Jerusalem and Benjamin (<a href="/2_chronicles/34-32.htm">2 Chronicles 34:32</a>), are the remnant of the ten tribes in their land, where Josiah, according to <a href="/2_chronicles/34-6.htm">2 Chronicles 34:6</a>., had also destroyed the idolatrous places of worship and the images. The statement in our verse, with which the account of Josiah's cultus reform is concluded, refers to that. &#1500;&#1506;&#1489;&#1491; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1489;&#1491;, he made to serve, compelled them to serve. By the abolition of idolatry he compelled them to worship Jahve. The last words of the verse are accordingly to be interpreted as signifying that Josiah, so long as he lived, allowed no open idolatry, but externally maintained the worship of Jahve. These measures could not effect a real, heartfelt conversion to God, and so the people fell again into open idolatry immediately after Josiah's death; and Jeremiah continually complains of the defection and corruption of Judah and Israel: cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-1.htm">2 Chronicles 11:1</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-1.htm">2 Chronicles 13:1</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-1.htm">2 Chronicles 25:1</a>, etc. </body></html>
