His solemnizing the passover is related here. The Lord's supper resembles the passover more than any other of the Jewish festivals; and the due observance of that ordinance, is a proof of growing piety and devotion. God alone can truly make our hearts holy, and prepare them for his holy services; but there are duties belonging to us, in doing which we obtain this blessing from the Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/35.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They might not depart - The singers and porters remained at their posts, while other Levites sacrificed for them and brought them their share of the lambs. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/35.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19. In the eighteenth year of the reign Josiah was this passover kept&#8212;"It is said (2Ki 22:3) that Josiah sent Shaphan to Hilkiah in the eighth month of that year." If this statement rests upon an historical basis, all the events narrated here (at 2Ch 34:8-35:19) must have happened in about the space of five months and a half. We should then have a proof that the eighteenth year of Josiah's reign was reckoned from the autumn (compare 2Ch 29:3). "The eighth month" of the sacred year in the eighteenth year of his reign would be the second month of his eighteenth year, and the first month of the new year would be the seventh month [Bertheau].<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/35.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_chronicles/35.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And there was no passover like to that kept in Israel,....

From this Bertheau draws the conclusion, "that with the paschal lambs the oxen were also offered as thank-offerings; and the sacrificial meal consisted not merely of the paschal lamb, but also of the flesh of the thank-offerings: for these must have been consumed on the same day as they were offered, though the eating of them on the following day was not strictly forbidden, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/7-15.htm">Leviticus 7:15-18</a>." But this conclusion is shown to be incorrect even by this fact, that there is no word to hint that the roasting of the paschal lambs and the cooking of the flesh of the oxen which were offered as thank-offerings took place simultaneously on the evening of the 14th Nisan. This is implied neither in the &#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512; &#1493;&#1499;&#1503;, nor in the statement in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-14.htm">2 Chronicles 35:14</a>, that the priests were busied until night in offering the &#1506;&#1500;&#1492; and the &#1495;&#1500;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501;. According to <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-17.htm">2 Chronicles 35:17</a>, the Israelites held on that day, not only the passover, but also the Mazzoth-feast, seven days. The description of the offering and preparation of the sacrifices, partly for the altar and partly for the meal, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-13.htm">2 Chronicles 35:13-15</a>, refers, therefore, not only to the passover in its more restricted sense, but also to the seven days' Mazzoth festival, without its being expressly stated; because both from the law and from the practice it was sufficiently well known that at the &#1508;&#1468;&#1505;&#1495; meal only &#1510;&#1488;&#1503; (lambs or goats) were roasted and eaten; while on the seven following days of the Mazzoth, besides the daily burnt-offering, thank-offerings were brought and sacrificial meals were held; see on <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-1.htm">Deuteronomy 16:1-8</a>. The connecting, or rather the mingling, of the sacrificial meal prepared from the roasted lambs with the eating of the sodden flesh of oxen, would have been too great an offence against the legal prescriptions for the paschal meal, to be attributed either to King Josiah, to the priesthood, or to the author of the Chronicle, since the latter expressly remarks that the celebration was carried out according to the prescription of the law of Moses, and according to the "right." </body></html>
