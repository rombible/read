The Keth. &#1502;&#1489;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; does not elsewhere occur, and must be regarded as a substantive: the teachers; but it is probably only an orthographical error for &#1502;&#1489;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; (<a href="/nehemiah/8-7.htm">Nehemiah 8:7</a>), as the Keri demands here also. As to the fact, cf. <a href="/2_chronicles/17-8.htm">2 Chronicles 17:8</a>. The Levites had to teach the people in the law. Josiah said to them, "Set the ark in the house which Solomon did build; not is to you to bear upon the shoulder;" i.e., ye have not any longer to bear it on your shoulders, as formerly on the journey through the wilderness, and indeed till the building of the temple, when the ark and the tabernacle had not yet any fixed resting-place (<a href="/1_chronicles/17-5.htm">1 Chronicles 17:5</a>). The summons &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1506;&#1512;&#1493;&#1503; &#1493;&#1468; &#1514;&#1468;&#1503; is variously interpreted. Several Rabbins regard it as a command to remove the ark from its place in the most holy place into some subterranean chamber of the temple, so as to secure its safety in the event of the threatened destruction of the temple taking place. But this hypothesis needs no refutation, since it in no way corresponds to the words used. Most ancient and modern commentators, on the other hand, suppose that the holy ark had, during the reigns of the godless Manasseh and Amon, either been removed by them from its place, or taken away from the most holy place, from a desire to protect it from profanation, and hidden somewhere; and that Josiah calls upon the Levites to bring it back again to its place. Certainly this idea is favoured by the circumstance that, just as the book of the law, which should have been preserved in the ark of the covenant, had been lost, and was only recovered when the temple was being repaired, so the ark also may have been removed from its place. But even in that case the sacred ark would have been brought back to its place, according to the law, at the completion of the purification of the temple, before the king and people made the covenant with Jahve, after the law had been read to them in the temple, and could not have remained in its hiding-place until the passover. Still less probable is Bertheau's conjecture, "that the Levites bore the just reconsecrated ark upon their shoulders at the celebration of the passover, under the idea that they were bound by the law to do so; but Josiah taught them that the temple built by Solomon had caused an alteration in that respect. They were no longer bearers of the ark; they might set it in its place, and undertake other duties." For the idea that the Levites bore the ark at the celebration of the passover is utterly inconsistent with the context, since <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-3.htm">2 Chronicles 35:3-6</a> do not treat of what was done at the passover, but merely of that which was to be done. But even if we were to alter "they bare" into "they wished to bear," yet there is no historic ground for the idea attributed by Bertheau to the Levites, that at the celebration of the passover the ark was to be brought forth from the most holy place, and carried in procession in the temple courts or elsewhere. Finally, the reasons stated for the call, &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, cannot be made to harmonize with the two views above mentioned. If it was only the bringing back of the ark to its ancient place in the most holy place which is here spoken of, why are the words "which Solomon built" added after &#1489;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;; and why is the command based upon the statement, "Ye have not to carry it any more upon your shoulders, but are to serve the Lord your God and His people in another way"? Both the additional clause and these reasons for the command show clearly that Josiah, in the words &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, did not command something which they were to do at the approaching passover, but merely introduces therewith the summons: "Serve now the Lord," etc. R. Sal. saw this, and has given the sense of the verse thus: quum non occupemini amplius ullo labore vasa sacra portandi, Deo servite et populo ejus mactando et excoriando agnos paschales v. 4ff. It therefore only remains to ascertain how this signification is consistent with the words &#1489;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; &#1492;&#1511; &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1488;&#1512;&#1493;&#1503; &#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;. The exhortation, "Set the ark in the house," must certainly not be understood to mean, "Leave it in the place where it has hitherto stood," nor, "Bring the sacred ark back into the house;" for &#1504;&#1514;&#1503; with &#1489;&#1468; does not mean to bring back, but only to place anywhere, set; and is here used not of material placing, but of mental. "Set the ark in the house" is equivalent to, "Overlook, leave it in the temple; you have not any longer, since Solomon built a house for it, to bear it upon your shoulders;" i.e., Think not on that which formerly, before the building of the temple, belonged to your service, but serve the Lord and His people now in the manner described in <a href="/2_chronicles/35-4.htm">2 Chronicles 35:4</a>. The interpretation of the words as denoting a material setting or removing of the ark, is completely excluded by the facts, (1) that in the description of what the Levites did at the passover, "according to the command of the king," which follows (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-10.htm">2 Chronicles 35:10-15</a>), not a word is said of the ark; and (2) that the bearing of the ark into the most holy place was not the duty of the Levites, but of the priests. The duty of the Levites was merely to bear the ark when it had to be transported for great distances, after the priests had previously wrapped it up in the prescribed manner. In <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-4.htm">2 Chronicles 35:4-6</a> the matters in which they are to serve the Lord in the preparation of the passover are more fully stated. The Keth. &#1492;&#1499;&#1493;&#1504;&#1493; is imper. Niphal, &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, Make yourselves ready according to your fathers'-houses, in your divisions, according to the writing of David. &#1489;&#1468; in &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1514;&#1489;, as in &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1514;,   <a href="/2_chronicles/29-25.htm">2 Chronicles 29:25</a>; but &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1489; does not  equals  &#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1514;, but is to be understood of writings, in which the arrangements made by David and Solomon in reference to the service of the Levites were recorded.</body></html>
