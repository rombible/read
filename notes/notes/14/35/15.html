The Lord's supper resembles the passover more than any other of the Jewish festivals; and the due observance of that ordinance, is a proof of growing piety and devotion.

The number of these gifts is not stated. From the princes of the king we must distinguish the prefects of the house of God and the princes of the Levites, who are mentioned by name in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-8.htm">2 Chronicles 35:8</a>, <a href="/2_chronicles/35-9.htm">2 Chronicles 35:9</a>. Of these the first presented sheep and cattle for passover-sacrifices to the priests, the latter to the Levites.

Of the Levite princes (<a href="/2_chronicles/35-9.htm">2 Chronicles 35:9</a>) six names are mentioned, three of which, Conaniah, Shemaiah, and Jozabad, are met with under Hezekiah in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-12.htm">2 Chronicles 31:12-15</a>, since in the priestly and Levitic families the same names recur in different generations. The Conaniah in Hezekiah's time was chief overseer of the temple revenues; the two others were under overseers.

Nothing is said as to the purpose of these, but from <a href="/2_chronicles/35-13.htm">2 Chronicles 35:13</a> we learn that the flesh of them was cooked in pots and caldrons, and consequently that they were intended for the sacrificial meals during the seven days of the Mazzoth-feast; see on <a href="/2_chronicles/35-12.htm">2 Chronicles 35:12</a> and <a href="/2_chronicles/35-13.htm">2 Chronicles 35:13</a>.</body></html>
