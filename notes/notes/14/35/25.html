And as it was usual with the Jews to make lamentations, elegies, or mournful pieces upon the death of great men, princes, and others that had distinguished themselves among them, and deserved well of their country, it is probable Jeremiah wrote such a piece on the occasion of Josiah’s death. If he did so, the loss of it is very much to be deplored, because, as Dr. Dodd observes, it was, no doubt, “a masterpiece of its kind as there never was an author more deeply affected with his subject, or more capable of carrying it through all the tender sentiments of sorrow and compassion, than Jeremiah.” <span class="ital">All the singing-men and singing-women spake of Josiah in their lamentations — </span>Among the Jews men and women were usually employed to mourn at funerals, and to sing the praises of the dead. And so real and great was the mourning for Josiah, that for ages afterward they always remembered it in their lamentations for the dead, saying of the person deceased, <span class="ital">Then art worthy to be lamented for, as good Josiah was, </span>or words to the same purpose. Or, as Poole thinks, the meaning may be, that in all their succeeding lamentations for their public calamities, they remembered Josiah’s death as their first and fatal blow, which opened the flood-gates to all their following miseries. <span class="ital">And made them an ordinance in Israel — </span>Ordained that the mournful pieces, penned on this sad occasion, should be learned and sung by all sorts of people. <span class="ital">And, behold, they are written in the Lamentations — </span>Not in the book termed <span class="ital">The Lamentations of Jeremiah, </span>which was written on another occasion; but in some collection of mournful poems, now lost.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/35.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>35:20-27 The Scripture does not condemn Josiah's conduct in opposing Pharaoh. Yet Josiah seems to deserve blame for not inquiring of the Lord after he was warned; his death might be a rebuke for his rashness, but it was a judgment on a hypocritical and wicked people. He that lives a life of repentance, faith, and obedience, cannot be affected by the sudden manner in which he is removed. The people lamented him. Many mourn over sufferings, who will not forsake the sins that caused God to send them. Yet this alone can turn away judgments.

The spot in the valley of Megiddo where the battle was fought was near the town of Hadad-rimmon; hence the lamentation for the death of Josiah was called "the lamentation of Hadad-rimmon in the valley of Megiddo," which was so great and so long continued, that the lamentation of Hadad passed afterwards into a proverbial phrase to express any great and extraordinary sorrow (Zec 12:11).   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/35.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">In their lamentations to this day; </span> in all their succeeding lamentations for their public calamities, and for the ruin of their city, and temple, and state, and church they remembered Josiah’s death as their first and most fatal blow, and as that which opened the flood-gates to all their following miseries, and it was ordained that they should do so, as the next words intimate. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In the lamentations; </span> either in that canonical book of Jeremiah’s Lamentations, or in some other volume of mournful ditties, made by divers persons upon occasion of their following calamities, which is since lost. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_chronicles/35.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah,....

On the points which distinguished this passover above others, see the remarks on <a href="/2_kings/23-22.htm">2 Kings 23:22</a>. In the concluding clause we have a rhetorical enumeration of those who participated in the festival, beginning with the king and ending with the inhabitants of Jerusalem. &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1502;&#1510;&#1488; &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500; are the remnant of the kingdom of the ten tribes who had come to the festival; cf. <a href="/2_chronicles/34-33.htm">2 Chronicles 34:33</a>. - In <a href="/2_chronicles/35-19.htm">2 Chronicles 35:19</a> the year of this passover is mentioned in conclusion. The statement, "in the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah," refers back to the same date at the beginning of the account of the cultus reform (<a href="/2_chronicles/34-8.htm">2 Chronicles 34:8</a> and <a href="/2_kings/22-3.htm">2 Kings 22:3</a>), and indicates that Josiah's cultus reform culminated in this passover. Now since the passover fell in the middle of the first month of the year, and, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34.htm">2 Chronicles 34</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/22.htm">2 Kings 22</a>, the book of the law was also found in the eighteenth year of Josiah's reign, many commentators have imagined that the eighteenth year of the king is dated from the autumn; so that all that is narrated in 2 Chronicles, from 34:8-35:19, happened within a period of six months and a half. This might possibly be the case; since the purification and repair of the temple may have been near their completion when the book of the law was found, so that they might hold the passover six months afterwards. But our passage does not require that the years of the king's reign should be dated from the autumn, and there are not sufficient grounds for believing that such was the case. Neither in our narrative, nor in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/22.htm">2 Kings 22</a> and 23, is it said that the passover was resolved upon or arrange din consequence of the finding of the book of the law. Josiah may therefore have thought of closing and ratifying the restoration of the Jahve-worship by a solemn passover festival, even before the finding of the book; and the two events need not be widely separated from each other. But from the way in which the account in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/22.htm">2 Kings 22</a> and 23 is arranged, it is not improbable that the finding of the book of the law may have occurred before the beginning of the eighteenth year of Josiah's reign, and that date may have been placed at the beginning and end of the narrative, because the cultus reform was completed with the celebration of the passover in his eighteenth year.<p>(Note: The addition of the lxx to <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/22-3.htm">2 Kings 22:3</a>, "in the eighth month," to which Thenius and Berth. attach some weight, as a proof that the years of Josiah's reign are dated from autumn, is utterly useless for that purpose. For even were that addition more than a worthless gloss, it would only prove the contrary, since the eighth month of the civil year, which is reckoned from autumn, corresponds to the second month of the ecclesiastical year, and would consequently carry us beyond the time of the passover.) </body></html>
