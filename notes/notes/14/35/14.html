His solemnizing the passover is related here. The Lord's supper resembles the passover more than any other of the Jewish festivals; and the due observance of that ordinance, is a proof of growing piety and devotion. God alone can truly make our hearts holy, and prepare them for his holy services; but there are duties belonging to us, in doing which we obtain this blessing from the Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/35.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They removed the burnt offerings - They separated from the Paschal lambs those parts which were to be burned on the altar.

The number of these gifts is not stated. From the princes of the king we must distinguish the prefects of the house of God and the princes of the Levites, who are mentioned by name in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-8.htm">2 Chronicles 35:8</a>, <a href="/2_chronicles/35-9.htm">2 Chronicles 35:9</a>. Of these the first presented sheep and cattle for passover-sacrifices to the priests, the latter to the Levites. Of the three &#1504;&#1490;&#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; of the house of God named in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-8.htm">2 Chronicles 35:8</a>, Hilkiah is the high priest (<a href="/2_chronicles/34-9.htm">2 Chronicles 34:9</a>), Zechariah perhaps the next to him (&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492; &#1499;&#1468;&#1492;&#1503;, <a href="/2_kings/25-18.htm">2 Kings 25:18</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/52-24.htm">Jeremiah 52:24</a>), and Jehiel is probably, as Berth. conjectures, the chief of the line of Ithamar, which continued to exist even after the exile (<a href="/ezra/8-2.htm">Ezra 8:2</a>). Of the Levite princes (<a href="/2_chronicles/35-9.htm">2 Chronicles 35:9</a>) six names are mentioned, three of which, Conaniah, Shemaiah, and Jozabad, are met with under Hezekiah in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-12.htm">2 Chronicles 31:12-15</a>, since in the priestly and Levitic families the same names recur in different generations. The Conaniah in Hezekiah's time was chief overseer of the temple revenues; the two others were under overseers. Besides the &#1508;&#1468;&#1505;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; for which the king and the princes of the priests and of the Levites gave &#1510;&#1488;&#1503;, i.e., lambs and young goats, &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;, oxen, in considerable numbers, are mentioned as presents; 3000 from the king, 300 from the princes of the priests, and 500 from the princes of the Levites. Nothing is said as to the purpose of these, but from <a href="/2_chronicles/35-13.htm">2 Chronicles 35:13</a> we learn that the flesh of them was cooked in pots and caldrons, and consequently that they were intended for the sacrificial meals during the seven days of the Mazzoth-feast; see on <a href="/2_chronicles/35-12.htm">2 Chronicles 35:12</a> and <a href="/2_chronicles/35-13.htm">2 Chronicles 35:13</a>.</body></html>
