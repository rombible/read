We have here, a wicked woman endeavouring to destroy the house of David, and a good woman preserving it. No word of God shall fall to the ground.

As Joram was thirty-two years of age at his accession, and reigned eight years (<a href="/2_chronicles/21-20.htm">2 Chronicles 21:20</a> and <a href="/2_chronicles/21-5.htm">2 Chronicles 21:5</a>), at his death his youngest son could not be older than twenty-one or twenty-two years of age, and even then Joram must have begotten him in his eighteenth or nineteenth year. It is quite consistent with this that Joram had yet older sons; for in the East marriages are entered upon at a very early age, and the royal princes were wont to have several wives, or, besides their proper wives, concubines also. Certainly, had Ahaziah had forty-two older brothers, as Berth. and other critics conclude from <a href="/2_kings/10-13.htm">2 Kings 10:13</a>., then he could not possibly have been begotten, or been born, in his father's eighteenth year. But that idea rests merely upon an erroneous interpretation of the passage quoted; see on <a href="/2_chronicles/22-8.htm">2 Chronicles 22:8</a>. Ahaziah's mother Athaliah is called the daughter, i.e., granddaughter, of Omri, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/8-26.htm">2 Kings 8:26</a>, because he was the founder of the idolatrous dynasty of the kingdom of the ten tribes.</body></html>
