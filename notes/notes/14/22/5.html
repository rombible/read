See and dread the mischief of bad company. If not the infection, yet let the destruction be feared, Re 18:4. We have here, a wicked woman endeavouring to destroy the house of David, and a good woman preserving it. No word of God shall fall to the ground. The whole truth of the prophecies that the Messiah was to come from David, and thereby the salvation of the world, appeared to be now hung upon the brittle thread of the life of a single infant, to destroy whom was the interest of the reigning power.

The words &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; &#1500;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1492;&#1511;&#1468;&#1509; &#1510;&#1488;&#1514; &#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1506;&#1514; are generally translated as if &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; &#1500;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; were a mere periphrasis of the stat. constr. Vatabl. and Cler., for example, translate: et secundum tempus egrediendi finis annorum duorum, i.e., postquam advenit finis a. d., or cum exacti essent duo anni; similarly Berth.: "at the time of the approach of the end of two times." But against this we have not only the circumstance that no satisfactory reason for the use of this periphrasis for the genitive can be perceived, and that no analogies can be found for the expression &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; &#1500;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1492;&#1511;&#1468;&#1509;, the end of two years, instead of &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1511;&#1509;; but also the more decisive linguistic reason that &#1492;&#1511;&#1468;&#1509; &#1510;&#1488;&#1514; cannot denote the approach of the end, but only the expiry, the running out of the end; and finally, that the supposition that &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; here and in <a href="/2_chronicles/21-15.htm">2 Chronicles 21:15</a> denotes a year is without foundation. Schmidt and Rabm. have already given a better explanation: quumque esset tempus, quo exiit finis s. quum exiret ac compleretur terminus ille, in epistola Eliae <a href="/2_chronicles/21-15.htm">2 Chronicles 21:15</a> praefixus; but in this case also we should expect &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1511;&#1509;, since &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; &#1500;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; should point back to &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1506;&#1500; &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, and contain a more exact definition of the terms employed in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-15.htm">2 Chronicles 21:15</a>, which are not definite enough. We therefore take &#1492;&#1511;&#1468;&#1509; &#1510;&#1488;&#1514; by itself, and translate: At the time of the end, i.e., when the end, sc. of life or of the disease, had come about two days, i.e., about two days before the issue of the end of the disease, then the bowels went out of the body-they flowed out from the body as devoured by the disease. &#1495;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; &#1506;&#1501;, in, during the sickness, consequently before the decease (cf. for &#1506;&#1501; in this signification, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/72-5.htm">Psalm 72:5</a>, <a href="/daniel/3-33.htm">Daniel 3:33</a>). Trusen (Sitten, Gebr. und Krankh. der alten Hebrer, S. 212f.) holds this disease to have been a violent dysentery (diarrhoea), "being an inflammation of the nervous tissue (Nervenhaut) of the whole great intestine, which causes the overlying mucous membrane to decay and peel off, which then falls out often in tube-shape, so that the intestines appear to fall from the body." His people did not make a burning for him like the burning of his fathers, cf. <a href="/2_chronicles/16-14.htm">2 Chronicles 16:14</a>; that is, denied him the honours usual at burial, because of their discontent with his evil reign. </body></html>
