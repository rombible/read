It appears from the character of Abijah, 1Ki 15:3, that he was not himself truly religious, yet he encouraged himself from the religion of his people. It is common for those that deny the power of godliness, to boast of the form of it. Many that have little religion themselves, value it in others. But it was true that there were numbers of pious worshippers in Judah, and that theirs was the more righteous cause. In their distress, when danger was on every side, which way should they look for deliverance unless upward? It is an unspeakable comfort, that our way thither is always open. They cried unto the Lord. Earnest prayer is crying. To the cry of prayer they added the shout of faith, and became more than conquerors. Jeroboam escaped the sword of Abijah, but God struck him; there is no escaping his sword.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The history of Abijah's reign is here related far more fully than in Kings (marginal reference), especially as regards his war with Jeroboam. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 13<p>2Ch 13:1-20.

Shishak plundered the treasures of the temple and the palace; he had consequently captured Jerusalem. The golden shields also which had been placed in the house of the forest of Lebanon, i.e., the palace built by Solomon in Jerusalem, which Solomon had caused to be made (cf. <a href="/2_chronicles/9-16.htm">2 Chronicles 9:16</a>), Shishak took away, and in their place Rehoboam caused brazen shields to be prepared; see on <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/14-26.htm">1 Kings 14:26-28</a>. - In <a href="/2_chronicles/12-12.htm">2 Chronicles 12:12</a> the author of the Chronicle concludes the account of this event with the didactic remark, "Because he (Rehoboam) humbled himself, the anger of Jahve was turned away from him." &#1500;&#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1497;&#1514; &#1493;&#1500;&#1488;, and it was not to extermination utterly (&#1500;&#1499;&#1500;&#1492;, properly to destruction, i.e., completely; cf. <a href="/ezekiel/13-13.htm">Ezekiel 13:13</a>). And also in Judah were good things. This is the other motive which caused the Lord to turn away His wrath. Good things are proofs of piety and fear of God, cf. <a href="/2_chronicles/19-3.htm">2 Chronicles 19:3</a>. </body></html>
