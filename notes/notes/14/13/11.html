It appears from the character of Abijah, 1Ki 15:3, that he was not himself truly religious, yet he encouraged himself from the religion of his people. It is common for those that deny the power of godliness, to boast of the form of it. Many that have little religion themselves, value it in others. But it was true that there were numbers of pious worshippers in Judah, and that theirs was the more righteous cause. In their distress, when danger was on every side, which way should they look for deliverance unless upward? It is an unspeakable comfort, that our way thither is always open. They cried unto the Lord. Earnest prayer is crying. To the cry of prayer they added the shout of faith, and became more than conquerors. Jeroboam escaped the sword of Abijah, but God struck him; there is no escaping his sword.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Seven rams - "A bullock and two rams" was the offering which God had required at the original consecration of the sons of Aaron <a href="/exodus/29-1.htm">Exodus 29:1</a>; <a href="/leviticus/8-2.htm">Leviticus 8:2</a>.

Abijah stood up upon Mount Zemaraim&#8212;He had entered the enemy's territory and was encamped on an eminence near Beth-el (Jos 18:22). Jeroboam's army lay at the foot of the hill, and as a pitched battle was expected, Abijah, according to the singular usage of ancient times, harangued the enemy. The speakers in such circumstances, while always extolling their own merits, poured out torrents of invective and virulent abuse upon the adversary. So did Abijah. He dwelt on the divine right of the house of David to the throne; and sinking all reference to the heaven-condemned offenses of Solomon and the divine appointment of Jeroboam, as well as the divine sanction of the separation, he upbraided Jeroboam as a usurper, and his subjects as rebels, who took advantage of the youth and inexperience of Rehoboam. Then contrasting the religious state of the two kingdoms, he drew a black picture of the impious innovations and gross idolatry introduced by Jeroboam, with his expulsion and impoverishment (2Ch 11:14) of the Levites. He dwelt with reasonable pride on the pure and regular observance of the ancient institutions of Moses in his own dominion [2Ch 13:11] and concluded with this emphatic appeal: "O children of Israel, fight ye not against Jehovah, the God of your fathers, for ye shall not prosper."<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The pure table; </span> so called, because it was made of pure gold, <span class="bld"><a href="/exodus/25-23.htm" title="You shall also make a table of shittim wood: two cubits shall be the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof.">Exodus 25:23</a>,24</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The candlestick; </span> he saith <span class="ital">table and candlestick</span>, though there were ten of each, <span class="bld"><a href="/2_chronicles/4-7.htm" title="And he made ten candlesticks of gold according to their form, and set them in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left.">2 Chronicles 4:7</a>,8</span>; either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

This representation does not conform to the state of the case as narrated in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/10.htm">2 Chronicles 10</a>. Rehoboam did not appear soft-hearted and compliant in the negotiation with the rebellious tribes at Sichem; on the contrary, he was hard and defiant, and showed himself youthfully inconsiderate only in throwing to the winds the wise advice of the older men, and in pursuance of the rash counsel of the young men who had grown up with him, brought about the rupture by his domineering manner. But Abijah wishes to justify his father as much as possible in his speech, and shifts all the guilt of the rebellion of the ten tribes from the house of David on to Jeroboam and his worthless following.</body></html>
