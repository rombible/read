Those who begin with God, begin at the right end of their work, and it will prosper accordingly. Those that turn their backs upon God's ordinances, may truly be said to forsake God himself. There are still such neglects, if the word be not duly read and opened, for that was signified by the lighting the lamps, and also if prayers and praise be not offered up, for that was signified by the burning incense. Neglect of God's worship was the cause of the calamities they had lain under. The Lord alone can prepare the heart of man for vital godliness: when much good is done in a little time, the glory must be ascribed to him; and all who love him or the souls of men, will rejoice therein.

Beginning with the outer courts&#8212;that of the priests and that of the people&#8212;the cleansing of these occupied eight days, after which they set themselves to purify the interior; but as the Levites were not allowed to enter within the walls of the temple, the priest brought all the sweepings out to the porch, where they were received by the Levites and thrown into the brook Kedron. This took eight days more. At the end of this period they repaired to the palace and announced that not only had the whole of the sacred edifice, within and without, undergone a thorough purification, but all the vessels which the late king had taken away and applied to a common use in his palace, had been restored, "and sanctified."<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/29.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The inner part of the house of the Lord; </span> not the holy of holies, into which only the high priest might enter, and that but once in a year; but the holy place. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Into the court, </span> to wit, the priests’ court, called here the court, by way of eminency. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_chronicles/29.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the priests went into the inner part of the house of the Lord, to cleanse it,....
