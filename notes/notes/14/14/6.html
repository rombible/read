Happy those that walk by this rule, not to do that which is right in their own eyes, or in the eye of the world, but which is so in God's sight. We find by experience that it is good to seek the Lord; it gives us rest; while we pursue the world, we meet with nothing but vexation. Asa consulted with his people how to make a good use of the peace they enjoyed; and concluded with them that they must not be idle, nor secure. A formidable army of Ethiopians invaded Asa's kingdom. This evil came upon them, that their faith in God might be tried. Asa's prayer is short, but it is the real language of faith and expectation from God. When we go forth in God's name, we cannot but prosper, and all things work together for the good of those whom he favours.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Images - See the margin, sun-images; and <a href="/leviticus/26-30.htm">Leviticus 26:30</a> note. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2Ch 14:6-8.

The Defensive Measures of Asa<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>According to 1 Kin., Asa being threatened by Baasha, king of Israel, secured himself a respite by inducing Ben-hadad of Syria with a heavy bribe to invade Baasha’s dominions. On the retirement of Israel Asa built himself two fortresses on his northern frontier to secure himself against Baasha. The Chronicler seems to be referring to the same occasion, but he says nothing of Baasha, nor of the intervention of Ben-hadad, and speaks of Asa building fortresses without mentioning their number.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He built fenced cities in Judah</span>.

This is remarked here, because this rest was also a result of Abijah's great victory over Jeroboam. </body></html>
