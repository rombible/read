Happy those that walk by this rule, not to do that which is right in their own eyes, or in the eye of the world, but which is so in God's sight. We find by experience that it is good to seek the Lord; it gives us rest; while we pursue the world, we meet with nothing but vexation. Asa consulted with his people how to make a good use of the peace they enjoyed; and concluded with them that they must not be idle, nor secure. A formidable army of Ethiopians invaded Asa's kingdom. This evil came upon them, that their faith in God might be tried. Asa's prayer is short, but it is the real language of faith and expectation from God. When we go forth in God's name, we cannot but prosper, and all things work together for the good of those whom he favours.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The "valley of Zephathah" - not elsewhere mentioned - is probably the broad Wady which opens out from Mareshah (marginal reference) in a northwesterly direction, leading into the great Philistine plain.

"At" some translate "belonging to," some more suitably to the exact connection "near." The Hebrew here for" valley" is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;</span>. It can scarcely designate necessarily a "ravine." It is a valley in the sense of being a low, fiat region, in which springs of water "broke out." From <a href="/numbers/21-20.htm">Numbers 21:20</a>, the first occasion of its occurrence, to <a href="/zechariah/14-5.htm">Zechariah 14:5</a> it is found fifty-six times, and is always rendered (Authorized Version) "valley;" it is the word used in the celebrated passages, "Though I walk through the valley" etc. (<a href="/psalms/23-4.htm">Psalm 23:4</a>); and "Every valley shall be exalted" (<a href="/isaiah/40-4.htm">Isaiah 40:4</a>).
