Happy those that walk by this rule, not to do that which is right in their own eyes, or in the eye of the world, but which is so in God's sight. We find by experience that it is good to seek the Lord; it gives us rest; while we pursue the world, we meet with nothing but vexation. Asa consulted with his people how to make a good use of the peace they enjoyed; and concluded with them that they must not be idle, nor secure. A formidable army of Ethiopians invaded Asa's kingdom. This evil came upon them, that their faith in God might be tried. Asa's prayer is short, but it is the real language of faith and expectation from God. When we go forth in God's name, we cannot but prosper, and all things work together for the good of those whom he favours.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Images - See the margin, sun-images; and <a href="/leviticus/26-30.htm">Leviticus 26:30</a> note. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. he took away &#8230; the high places&#8212;that is, those devoted to idolatrous rites.<p>took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the images&#8212;All public objects and relics of idolatry in Jerusalem and other cities through his kingdom were destroyed; but those high places where God was worshipped under the figure of an ox, as at Beth-el, were allowed to remain (1Ki 15:14); so far the reformation was incomplete.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_chronicles/14.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the images,....

This, however, is the rendering adopted by not a few modern commentators (so <a href="/2_chronicles/34-4.htm">2 Chronicles 34:4</a>).

While Jeroboam was not able to recover from the defeat he had suffered, Abijah established himself in his kingdom (&#1497;&#1514;&#1495;&#1494;&#1468;&#1511;, cf. <a href="/2_chronicles/12-13.htm">2 Chronicles 12:13</a>), and took to himself fourteen wives. The taking of these wives is not to be regarded as later in time than his establishment of his rule after the victory over Jeroboam. Since Abijah reigned only three years, he must have already had the greater number of his wives and children when he ascended the throne, as we may gather also from <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-21.htm">2 Chronicles 11:21-23</a>. The &#1493; consec. with &#1497;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488; serves only to connect logically the information as to his wives and children with the preceding, as the great increase of his family was a sign of Abijah's increase in strength, while Jeroboam's dynasty was soon extirpated.</body></html>
