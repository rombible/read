Abijah’s victory, which was owing, under God, to his courage and bravery, laid a foundation for Asa’s peace, which was the reward of his piety, and the reformation he effected. Though Abijah had little religion himself, he was instrumental in preparing the way for one that had much. If Abijah had not done what he did to quiet the land, Asa could not have done what he did to reform it.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/14.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>14:1-15 Asa's piety, He strengthens his kingdom. - Asa aimed at pleasing God, and studied to approve himself to him. Happy those that walk by this rule, not to do that which is right in their own eyes, or in the eye of the world, but which is so in God's sight. We find by experience that it is good to seek the Lord; it gives us rest; while we pursue the world, we meet with nothing but vexation. Asa consulted with his people how to make a good use of the peace they enjoyed; and concluded with them that they must not be idle, nor secure. A formidable army of Ethiopians invaded Asa's kingdom. This evil came upon them, that their faith in God might be tried. Asa's prayer is short, but it is the real language of faith and expectation from God. When we go forth in God's name, we cannot but prosper, and all things work together for the good of those whom he favours.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Asa his son reigned - If Rehoboam was (<a href="/1_kings/12-8.htm">1 Kings 12:8</a> note) not more than 21 years old at his accession, Asa, when he mounted the throne, must have been a mere boy, not more than 10 or 11 years of age.<p>The land was quiet ten years - The great blow struck by Abijah <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-15.htm">2 Chronicles 13:15-19</a>, his alliance with Syria <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/15-19.htm">1 Kings 15:19</a>, and the rapid succession of sovereigns in Israel during the earlier part of Asa's reign <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/15-25.htm">1 Kings 15:25-33</a>, would naturally prevent disturbance on the part of the northern kingdom.

If, according to the suggestion of our note, <a href="/2_chronicles/10-8.htm">2 Chronicles 10:8</a> and 2 Chron 12:13, the alleged forty-one years of the age of Rehoboam be made twenty-one, it will follow that Asa could not now be more than a boy of some twelve years of age. It is against that suggestion that there is no sign of this, by word or deed, in what is here said of the beginning of Asa's reign; the signs are to the contrary, especially taking into the question the indications given us respecting the tendencies, if not contradicted, of the queen-mother Maachah (<a href="/2_chronicles/15-16.htm">2 Chronicles 15:16</a>; <a href="/1_kings/15-13.htm">1 Kings 15:13</a>), and it is not supposable that a boy of twelve years of age could contradict them. This point must be held still moot. <span class="cmt_word">In his days...  quiet ten years</span>. No doubt one cause of this was the defeat that Jeroboam and Israel had sustained at the hands of Abijah (<a href="/2_chronicles/13-18.htm">2 Chronicles 13:18-20</a>). It appears also, from <a href="/1_kings/15-19.htm">1 Kings 15:19</a>, that after that defeat a league was instituted between Abijah and the then King of Syria: "There is a league between me and thee, and between <span class="accented">my father and thy father."</span> And these things, with Israel's new kings, and <span class="accented">perhaps</span> Asa's extreme youth, would have favoured the repose of the land. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_chronicles/13.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>So Abijah and his people inflicted a great blow (defeat) on the Israelites, so that 500,000 of them, i.e., more than the half of Jeroboam's whole army, fell.</body></html>
