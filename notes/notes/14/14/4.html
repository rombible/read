Happy those that walk by this rule, not to do that which is right in their own eyes, or in the eye of the world, but which is so in God's sight. We find by experience that it is good to seek the Lord; it gives us rest; while we pursue the world, we meet with nothing but vexation. Asa consulted with his people how to make a good use of the peace they enjoyed; and concluded with them that they must not be idle, nor secure. A formidable army of Ethiopians invaded Asa's kingdom. This evil came upon them, that their faith in God might be tried. Asa's prayer is short, but it is the real language of faith and expectation from God. When we go forth in God's name, we cannot but prosper, and all things work together for the good of those whom he favours.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Asa his son reigned - If Rehoboam was (<a href="/1_kings/12-8.htm">1 Kings 12:8</a> note) not more than 21 years old at his accession, Asa, when he mounted the throne, must have been a mere boy, not more than 10 or 11 years of age.<p>The land was quiet ten years - The great blow struck by Abijah <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-15.htm">2 Chronicles 13:15-19</a>, his alliance with Syria <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/15-19.htm">1 Kings 15:19</a>, and the rapid succession of sovereigns in Israel during the earlier part of Asa's reign <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/15-25.htm">1 Kings 15:25-33</a>, would naturally prevent disturbance on the part of the northern kingdom.
