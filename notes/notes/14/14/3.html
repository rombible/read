Strange gods were worshipped, and had their altars, images, and groves: and the temple-service, though kept up by the priests, was neglected by many of the people. As soon as Asa had power in his hands, he made it his business to destroy those idolatrous altars and images, they being a great provocation to the jealous God, and a great temptation to a careless and unthinking people. He hoped, by destroying the idols, to reform the idolaters, which he had in view, and not their destruction.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/14.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>14:1-15 Asa's piety, He strengthens his kingdom. - Asa aimed at pleasing God, and studied to approve himself to him. Happy those that walk by this rule, not to do that which is right in their own eyes, or in the eye of the world, but which is so in God's sight. We find by experience that it is good to seek the Lord; it gives us rest; while we pursue the world, we meet with nothing but vexation. Asa consulted with his people how to make a good use of the peace they enjoyed; and concluded with them that they must not be idle, nor secure. A formidable army of Ethiopians invaded Asa's kingdom. This evil came upon them, that their faith in God might be tried. Asa's prayer is short, but it is the real language of faith and expectation from God. When we go forth in God's name, we cannot but prosper, and all things work together for the good of those whom he favours.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Asa his son reigned - If Rehoboam was (<a href="/1_kings/12-8.htm">1 Kings 12:8</a> note) not more than 21 years old at his accession, Asa, when he mounted the throne, must have been a mere boy, not more than 10 or 11 years of age.<p>The land was quiet ten years - The great blow struck by Abijah <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-15.htm">2 Chronicles 13:15-19</a>, his alliance with Syria <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/15-19.htm">1 Kings 15:19</a>, and the rapid succession of sovereigns in Israel during the earlier part of Asa's reign <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/15-25.htm">1 Kings 15:25-33</a>, would naturally prevent disturbance on the part of the northern kingdom.

This expression, "strange gods," is found in the Authorized Version about thirteen times for the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b5;&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span>, or <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span>, and would be most correctly rendered, "The gods [or, 'god'] of the stranger," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of the <span class="accented">foreigner</span>, as it is rendered in the solitary instance of <a href="/deuteronomy/31-16.htm">Deuteronomy 31:16</a>. <span class="cmt_word">The high</span> <span class="cmt_word">places.</span> Comp. ver. 5 and <a href="/2_chronicles/15-17.htm">2 Chronicles 15:17</a>, which says, "But the high places were not taken away out of Israel;" and <a href="/1_kings/15-14.htm">1 Kings 15:14</a>, which says, "But the high places were not removed," without limiting this non-removal to "of Israel." On the question of this apparent inconsistency and surface-contradiction, see our Introduction, &sect;7, pp. 16:1 and 17:2. Further, it may here be well distinctly to note how little is even the apparent discrepancy or contradiction alleged in this subject, throwing in the analogous passages in Jehoshaphat's history (<a href="/2_chronicles/17-6.htm">2 Chronicles 17:6</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/20-33.htm">2 Chronicles 20:33</a>), in case these may reflect any light on the question. Firstly, we will remove out of our way the parallel in <a href="/1_kings/15-14.htm">1 Kings 15:14</a>, with the observation that it is evident from its immediate context that it corresponds with the last statement of our Chronicles (<a href="/2_chronicles/15-17.htm">2 Chronicles 15:17</a>), savouring of a <span class="accented">retrospective</span> summarizing of the compiler, not with the first statements (<a href="/2_chronicles/14-3.htm">2 Chronicles 14:3, 5</a>), which set forth Asa's prospective purpose of heart, his resolution, and, no doubt, his edicts. Secondly, we may notice that there is a plain-enough distinction made by the writer in vers. 3 and 5 respectively - the one saying that Asa "took away the high places," without any further limitation; the other saying within two verses, "Also out of all the cities of Judah" (note by the way here the suggestive stress laid upon "the <span class="accented">cities</span>," possibly as more easily coped with than country districts) "he took away the high places." The only legitimate inference (taking into account both the words used, and the fact that the last written are found <span class="accented">close upon</span> the former, with the significant conjunction "also") must be that some different information was intended in the two places. Ver. 3 finds Asa as much master of "Judah" as ver. 5. Therefore the natural interpretation of ver. 3 must be that Asa at once abolished "the high places" nearest home, nearest Jerusalem, most within his own personal reach; then "<span class="accented">also"</span> that he did and ordered the same to be done in "all the cities of Judah," and it was done at the time, if only for the time. Thirdly, include the statement of <a href="/2_chronicles/15-17.htm">2 Chronicles 15:17</a>, if we do not insist (as we might insist very fairly when pressed on a point of alleged inconsistency or contradiction) on the fact that now the high places "of Israel" arc distinctly designated, and that therein those <span class="accented">outlying</span> parts of Asa's more or less acknowledged sway <span class="accented">outside of Judah</span> and his thoroughest control are designedly described, let us instead take the help of an exactly analogous (and analogously alleged) discrepancy (<a href="/2_chronicles/17-7.htm">2 Chronicles 17:7</a> compared with <a href="/2_chronicles/20-33.htm">2 Chronicles 20:33</a>), and we find there that the very key with which to unlock the difficulty is provided to our hand. Jehoshaphat (<a href="/2_chronicles/17-6.htm">2 Chronicles 17:6</a>) "took away the high places;" "the people" (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-33.htm">2 Chronicles 20:33</a>) did not faithfully and with a constant heart follow suit, but had failed to prepare, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to turn "their hearts unto the God of their fathers." How well the juxtaposition of these very words would tell, nay, do tell, with the emphatic words of <a href="/1_kings/15-14.htm">1 Kings 15:14</a>! "Nevertheless <span class="accented">Asa's</span> heart was perfect with the Lord <span class="accented">all his</span> days;" and with our <a href="/2_chronicles/15-17.htm">2 Chronicles 15:17</a>, "Nevertheless the heart of <span class="accented">Asa</span> was perfect <span class="accented">all</span> his days." In both these passages the antithesis is patent between Asa's heart and the <span class="accented">people's</span> hearts, between Asa's "<span class="accented">all</span> his days" and the people's uncertainty and apostasy. The  fidelity of Bible history and its non-cunningly, non-fabulously devised tenor  are gratefully corroborated by the inquisition made into such a supposed "discrepancy," inconsistency," "contradiction." Notice once more the confirming indication, so far as it goes, of the one verb that commands the next verse, as there noted upon. <span class="cmt_word">Brake down the images</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e6;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>. It occurs in the Authorized Version thirty-two times, and is rendered "pillar" or "pillars" twelve times; "image" or "images" nineteen times; and "garrisons" once. It appears simply to have slipped from the signification of <span class="accented">pillar</span> into the rendering of the word "image," by aid of the intermediate word "statue." It is used of the pillar or statue of Baal in <a href="/2_kings/3-2.htm">2 Kings 3:2</a>; <a href="/2_kings/10-26.htm">2 Kings 10:26, 27</a>, with his name expressed; and in <a href="/2_chronicles/18-4.htm">2 Chronicles 18:4</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/23-14.htm">2 Chronicles 23:14</a>, without that name expressed. Cut down the groves; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5d2;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;&#x5be;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>. The verb here used implies the "cutting," "cutting down," "pruning" of trees. It is undoubtedly applied also to other cutting and cutting down, as of the "breaking" of a red (<a href="/zechariah/11-10.htm">Zechariah 11:10</a>), of an arm (<a href="/1_samuel/2-31.htm">1 Samuel 2:31</a>), of horns (<a href="/jeremiah/48-25.htm">Jeremiah 48:25</a>), of bars or bolts (<a href="/isaiah/45-2.htm">Isaiah 45:2</a>). It occurs in all twenty-three times. It is here employed to describe the destroying of what according to the Authorized Version arc called "groves" (Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bb;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">lucus</span>) <span class="accented">- a</span> word which with little doubt misleads for the rendering of our <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>. Before this same word we have also another Hebrew verb for "cutting," of very frequent occurrence in its simple and metaphorically derived uses included, viz. <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span>. The first uses of this verb with the above word are found in <a href="/judges/6-25.htm">Judges 6:25, 26, 30</a>. That word means literally "fortune," but in its ultimate derivation "straightness," and hence supposed to designate, in Phoenician and Aramaean idolatry, Astarte or the planet Venus, who is constantly associated in such idolatry with Baal (<a href="/judges/3-7.htm">Judges 3:7</a>). But see for the first occurrence of the word, <a href="/exodus/34-13.htm">Exodus 34:13</a>, where there is no express mention of Baal, but where the idolatries of the Amorite, Canaanite, Hittite, Hivite, Perizzite, and Jebusite are being spoken cf. When we take into consideration the probable ultimate derivation of the word, the fact of the verbs that speak of "cutting" being uniformly applied to what it represents, the "burning" to which this was condemned (<a href="/judges/6-26.htm">Judges 6:26</a>) when cut down, and a series of statements that represent it as "set up <span class="accented">under every</span> green tree" (<a href="/1_kings/14-23.htm">1 Kings 14:23</a>; <a href="/2_kings/17-10.htm">2 Kings 17:10</a>; see also <a href="/1_kings/15-13.htm">1 Kings 15:13</a>; <a href="/2_kings/21-7.htm">2 Kings 21:7</a>; <a href="/2_kings/23-6.htm">2 Kings 23:6</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/15-16.htm">2 Chronicles 15:16</a>), it not only becomes perfectly certain that "grove" and "groves" cannot rightly render the word, but directs us with the light of those passages that speak of it coupled with Baal as an object of worship, and that speak of prophet and priest called by its name (<a href="/judges/3-7.htm">Judges 3:7</a> (compared with Judges 2:13; 10:6; <a href="/1_samuel/7-4.htm">1 Samuel 7:4</a>); <a href="/1_kings/18-19.htm">1 Kings 18:19</a>; <a href="/2_kings/21-3.htm">2 Kings 21:3</a>; <a href="/2_kings/23-4.htm">2 Kings 23:4</a>), to the strong conviction that it should be at once written with a capital letter, and rendered as a proper name; that it may possibly be a synonym with Ashtoreth, 1.<span class="accented">q.</span> Astarte, or a representation in wooden pillar, stock or trunk fashion, of some supposed aspect of her passion or dominion, very likely in the voluptuous or sensual direction (see the nevertheless very doubtful Septuagint and Vulgate, <a href="/2_chronicles/15-16.htm">2 Chronicles 15:16</a>; and Vulgate, <a href="/judges/3-7.htm">Judges 3:7</a>). Conder, in 'Handbook to the Bible,' p. 187, 2nd edit., speaks of "Baal-peor (<a href="/numbers/25-3.htm">Numbers 25:3</a>) as identified by St. Jerome with the classical Priapus;" and adds "the <span class="accented">Asherah</span> (rendered 'grove' in our version) was also apparently a similar emblem" (<a href="/2_kings/23-7.htm">2 Kings 23:7</a>). The analogy of the sacred tree of the Assyrians sculptured on the monuments of Nineveh ('Nineveh and Persepolis,' p. 299, Fergusson), which was probably a straight trunk or stock garlanded at certain times with ribbons and flowers, has been opportunely pointed to (see also Professor Dr. Murphy's 'Handbook: Chronicles,' p. 115). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_chronicles/13.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The results of this victory. The Israelites were bowed down, their power weakened; the men of Judah became strong, mighty, because they relied upon Jahve their God. Following up his victory, Abijah took from Jeroboam several cities with their surrounding domains: Bethel, the present Beitin, see on <a href="/joshua/7-2.htm">Joshua 7:2</a>; Jeshanah, occurring only here, and the position of which has not yet been ascertained; and Ephron (&#1506;&#1508;&#1512;&#1493;&#1503;, Keth.; the Keri, on the contrary, &#1506;&#1508;&#1512;&#1497;&#1503;). This city cannot well be identified with Mount Ephron, <a href="/joshua/15-9.htm">Joshua 15:9</a>; for that mountain was situated on the southern frontier of Benjamin, not far from Jerusalem, while the city Ephron is to be sought much farther north, in the neighbourhood of Bethel. C. v. Raumer and others identify Ephron or Ephrain both with Ophrah of Benjamin, which, it is conjectured, was situated near or in Tayibeh, to the east of Bethel, and with the &#x395;&#787;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#836;&#769;&#x3bc;, <a href="//biblehub.com/john/11-54.htm">John 11:54</a>, whither Jesus withdrew into the wilderness, which, according to Josephus, Bell. Jud. iv. 9. 9, lay in the neighbourhood of Bethel. See on <a href="/joshua/18-23.htm">Joshua 18:23</a>.<p>(Note: The account of this war, which is peculiar to the Chronicle, and which de Wette declared, on utterly insufficient grounds, to be an invention of the chronicler (cf. against him my apol. Vers. ber die Chron. S. 444ff.), is thus regarded by Ewald (Gesch. Isr. iii. S. 466, der 2:Aufl.): "The chronicler must certainly have found among his ancient authorities an account of this conclusion of the war, and we cannot but believe that we have here, in so far, authentic tradition;" and only the details of the description are the results of free expansion by the chronicler, but in the speech <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-4.htm">2 Chronicles 13:4-13</a> every word and every thought is marked by the peculiar colouring of the Chronicle. But this last assertion is contradicted by Ewald's own remark, i. S. 203, that "in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-4.htm">2 Chronicles 13:4-7</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-19.htm">2 Chronicles 13:19-21</a>, an antiquated manner of speech and representation appears, while in the other verses, on the contrary, those usual with the chronicler are found," - in support of which he adduces the words &#1489;&#1500;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500; &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-7.htm">2 Chronicles 13:7</a>, and &#1502;&#1500;&#1495; &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514;, <a href="/2_chronicles/13-5.htm">2 Chronicles 13:5</a>. According to this view, Abijah's speech cannot have been freely draughted by the chronicler, but must have been derived, at least so far as the fundamental thoughts are concerned, from an ancient authority, doubtless the Midrash of the prophet Iddo, cited in <a href="/2_chronicles/13-22.htm">2 Chronicles 13:22</a>. But Ewald's further remark (iii. S. 466), that the author of the Chronicle, because he regarded the heathenized Samaria of his time as the true representative of the old kingdom of the ten tribes, seized this opportunity to put into King Abijah's mouth a long denunciatory and didactic speech, addressed at the commencement of the battle to the enemy as rebels not merely against the house of David, but also against the true religion, is founded upon the unscriptural idea that the calf-worship of the Israelites was merely a somewhat sensuous form of the true Jahve-worship, and was fundamentally distinct from the heathen idolatry, and also from the idolatry of the later Samaritans. In the judgment of all the prophets, not only of Hosea and Amos, but also of the prophetic author of the book of Kings, the calf-worship was a defection from Jahve, the God of the fathers, - a forsaking of the commands of Jahve, and a serving of the Baals; cf. e.g., <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/13.htm">1 Kings 13</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/17-7.htm">2 Kings 17:7-23</a>. What Abijah says of the calf-worship of the Israelites, and of Judah's attitude to Jahve and His worship in the temple, is founded on the truth, and is also reconcilable with the statement in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/15-3.htm">1 Kings 15:3</a>, that Abijah's heart was not wholly devoted to the Lord, like David's heart. Abijah had promoted the legal temple-worship even by consecratory gifts (<a href="/1_kings/15-15.htm">1 Kings 15:15</a>), and could consequently quite well bring forward the worship of God in Judah as the true worship, in contrast to the Israelitic calf-worship, for the discouragement of his enemies, and for the encouragement of his own army; and we may consequently regard the kernel, or the essential contents of the speech, as being historically well-founded. The account of the war, moreover, is also shown to be historical by the exact statement as to the conquered cities in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-19.htm">2 Chronicles 13:19</a>, which evidently has been derived from ancient authorities. Only in the statements about the number of warriors, and of the slain Israelites, the numbers are not to be estimated according to the literal value of the figures; for they are, as has been already hinted in the commentary, only an expression in figures of the opinion of contemporaries of the war, that both kings had made a levy of all the men in their respective kingdoms capable of bearing arms, and that Jeroboam was defeated with such slaughter that he lost more than the half of his warriors.)</body></html>
