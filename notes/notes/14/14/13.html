Happy those that walk by this rule, not to do that which is right in their own eyes, or in the eye of the world, but which is so in God's sight. We find by experience that it is good to seek the Lord; it gives us rest; while we pursue the world, we meet with nothing but vexation. Asa consulted with his people how to make a good use of the peace they enjoyed; and concluded with them that they must not be idle, nor secure. A formidable army of Ethiopians invaded Asa's kingdom. This evil came upon them, that their faith in God might be tried. Asa's prayer is short, but it is the real language of faith and expectation from God. When we go forth in God's name, we cannot but prosper, and all things work together for the good of those whom he favours.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The defeat of Zerah is one of the most remarkable events in the history of the Jews. On no other occasion did they meet in the field and overcome the forces of either of the two great monarchies between which they were placed. It was seldom that they ventured to resist, unless behind walls. Shishak, Sennacherib, Esarhaddon, Nebuchadnezzar, were either unopposed or only opposed in this way. On the one other occasion on which they took the field - under Josiah against Necho - their boldness issued in a most disastrous defeat <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-20.htm">2 Chronicles 35:20-24</a>. Now, however, under Asa, they appear to have gained a complete victory over Egypt. The results which followed were nicest striking. The Southern power could not rally from the blow, and, for above three centuries made no further effort in this direction. Assyria, growing in strength, finally, under Sargon and Sennacherib, penetrated to Egypt itself. All fear of Egypt as an aggressive power ceased; and the Israelites learned instead to lean upon the Pharaohs for support (<a href="/2_kings/17-4.htm">2 Kings 17:4</a>; <a href="/2_kings/18-21.htm">2 Kings 18:21</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/30-2.htm">Isaiah 30:2-4</a>, etc.). Friendly ties alone connected the two countries: and it was not until 609 B.C. that an Egyptian force again entered Palestine with a hostile intention. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11-13. Asa cried unto the Lord his God&#8212;Strong in the confidence that the power of God was able to give the victory equally with few as with many, the pious king marched with a comparatively small force to encounter the formidable host of marauders at his southern frontier. Committing his cause to God, he engaged in the conflict&#8212;completely routed the enemy, and succeeded in obtaining, as the reward of his victory, a rich booty in treasure and cattle from the tents of this pastoral horde.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Gerar; </span> a city of the Philistines, who probably were confederate with them in this design. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_chronicles/14.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Asa, and the people that were with him, pursued them unto Gerar,....

The numbers are great; of Judah 300,000, of Benjamin 280,000 men. Since in these numbers the whole population capable of bearing arms is included, 300,000 men does not appear too large for Judah, but 280,000 is a very large number for Benjamin, and is founded probably on an overestimate. </body></html>
