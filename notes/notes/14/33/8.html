Deprived of his liberty, separated from his evil counsellors and companions, without any prospect but of ending his days in a wretched prison, Manasseh thought upon what had passed; he began to cry for mercy and deliverance. He confessed his sins, condemned himself, was humbled before God, loathing himself as a monster of impiety and wickedness. Yet he hoped to be pardoned through the abundant mercy of the Lord. Then Manasseh knew that Jehovah was God, able to deliver. He knew him as a God of salvation; he learned to fear, trust in, love, and obey him. From this time he bore a new character, and walked in newness of life. Who can tell what tortures of conscience, what pangs of grief, what fears of wrath, what agonizing remorse he endured, when he looked back on his many years of apostacy and rebellion against God; on his having led thousands into sin and perdition; and on his blood-guiltiness in the persecution of a number of God's children? And who can complain that the way of heaven is blocked up, when he sees such a sinner enter? Say the worst against thyself, here is one as bad who finds the way to repentance. Deny not to thyself that which God hath not denied to thee; it is not thy sin, but thy impenitence, that bars heaven against thee.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/33.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The idol - i. e. the Asherah (<a href="/2_kings/21-7.htm">2 Kings 21:7</a> note), which receives here (and in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-3.htm">Ezekiel 8:3</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/8-5.htm">Ezekiel 8:5</a>) the somewhat unusual name of semel, which some regard as a proper name, and compare with the Greek &#x3a3;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;  Semele&#772;. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/33.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 33<p>2Ch 33:1-10.

The word &#1505;&#1502;&#1500;, sculpture or statue, is derived from <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-16.htm">Deuteronomy 4:16</a>, but has perhaps been taken by the author of the Chronicle from <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-3.htm">Ezekiel 8:3</a>, where &#1505;&#1502;&#1500; probably denotes the statue of Asherah.
