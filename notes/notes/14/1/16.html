Those that pursue present things most eagerly, are likely to be disappointed; while those that refer themselves to the providence of God, if they have not the most, have the most comfort. Those that make this world their end, come short of the other, and are disappointed in this also; but those that make the other world their end, shall not only obtain that, and full satisfaction in it, but shall have as much of this world as is good for them, in their way.

His Strength and Wealth.<p>14. Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen&#8212;His passion for horses was greater than that of any Israelitish monarch before or after him. His stud comprised fourteen hundred chariots and twelve thousand horses. This was a prohibited indulgence, whether as an instrument of luxury or power. But it was not merely for his own use that he imported the horses of Egypt. The immense equestrian establishment he erected was not for show merely, but also for profit. The Egyptian breed of horses was highly valued; and being as fine as the Arabian, but larger and more powerful, they were well fitted for being yoked in chariots. These were light but compact and solid vehicles, without springs. From the price stated (2Ch 1:17) as given for a chariot and a horse, it appears that the chariot cost four times the value of a horse. A horse brought a 150 shekels, which, estimating the shekels at 2s. 3d. or 2s. 6d., amount to &pound;17 2s. or &pound;18 15s., while a chariot brought 600 shekels, equal to &pound;68 9s. or &pound;75; and as an Egyptian chariot was usually drawn by two horses, a chariot and pair would cost &pound;112 sterling. As the Syrians, who were fond of the Egyptian breed of horses, could import them into their own country only through Judea, Solomon early perceived the commercial advantages to be derived from this trade, and established a monopoly. His factors or agents purchased them in the markets or fairs of Egypt and brought them to the "chariot cities," the depots and stables he had erected on the frontiers of his kingdom, such as Bethmarcaboth, "the house of chariots," and Hazarsusah, "the village of horses" (Jos 19:5; 1Ki 10:28).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_chronicles/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then Solomon came from his journey to the high place that was at Gibeon,....

According to a third view the Heb. “miḳvê” means neither “yarn” nor “drove,” but conceals a proper name, known to us from Assyrian inscriptions, <span class="ital">Ku‘i</span> or <span class="ital">Kuë</span> (= Cilicia). In this case the horses would be brought in the first place from eastern Asia Minor and Armenia, since Cilicia itself is not a horse-breeding country. We then translate, <span class="ital">And the horses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt and out of Cilicia; the king’s merchants received them from Cilicia at a price</span>. The further supposition that “Egypt” (Mizraim) is a mistake for “Musri” (a land supposed to lie N.E. of Cilicia) may be true but is difficult to prove.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Horses brought.., out of Egypt.</span> Later on we read that horses were imported from other countries as well (<a href="/2_chronicles/9-24.htm">2 Chronicles 9:24, 28</a>), as, for instance, from Arabia and Armenia (<a href="/ezekiel/27-14.htm">Ezekiel 27:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Linen yarn</span>.
