Then Solomon spake unto all Israel&#8212;The heads, or leading officers, who are afterwards specified, were summoned to attend their sovereign in a solemn religious procession. The date of this occurrence was the second year of Solomon's reign, and the high place at Gibeon was chosen for the performance of the sacred rites, because the tabernacle and all the ancient furniture connected with the national worship were deposited there. Zadok was the officiating high priest (1Ch 16:39). It is true that the ark had been removed and placed in a new tent which David had made for it at Jerusalem [2Ch 1:4]. But the brazen altar, "before the tabernacle of the Lord," on which the burnt offerings were appointed by the law to be made, was at Gibeon. And although David had been led by extraordinary events and tokens of the divine presence to sacrifice on the threshing-floor of Araunah, Solomon considered it his duty to present his offerings on the legally appointed spot "before the tabernacle," and on the time-honored altar prepared by the skill of Bezaleel in the wilderness (Ex 38:1).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">He put; </span> either Moses, mentioned <span class="bld"><a href="/2_chronicles/1-3.htm" title="So Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon; for there was the tabernacle of the congregation of God, which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in the wilderness.">2 Chronicles 1:3</a></span>, or Bezaleel, here last named, by the command and direction of Moses; or David, who may be said to put it there, because he continued it there, and did not remove it, as he did the ark from the tabernacle. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Sought unto it, </span> i.e. sought the Lord and his favour by hearty prayers and sacrifices in the place which God had appointed for that work, <span class="bld"><a href="/leviticus/17-3.htm" title="What man soever there be of the house of Israel, that kills an ox, or lamb, or goat, in the camp, or that kills it out of the camp,">Leviticus 17:3</a>,4</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_chronicles/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Moreover, the brasen altar that Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made,....

This statement is introduced to lay stress on the fact that, though the ark indeed was not with the tabernacle, the brazen altar of burnt offering assuredly was there, this constituting the place, the proper spot, for sacrifice and worship. (For the account of the brazen altar and its making, see <a href="/exodus/27-1.htm">Exodus 27:1-8</a>; <a href="/exodus/38-1.htm">Exodus 38:1-7</a>; also <a href="/numbers/16-38.htm">Numbers 16:38, 39</a>.) This altar of burnt offering is often spoken of as the altar, to distinguish it from the altar of incense (<a href="/exodus/30-1.htm">Exodus 30:1</a>; <a href="/exodus/39-38.htm">Exodus 39:38</a>; <a href="/numbers/4-11.htm">Numbers 4:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Bezaleel</span>.

The reading (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>), "was <span class="accented">there</span> before<span class="accented"></span>," is to be preferred, tallying as it does exactly with <a href="/exodus/40-6.htm">Exodus 40:6</a>.

But whether the object of the verb be in this place Jehovah or the altar, it would seem probable that the clause purports to say that Solomon and his people were accustomed to repair thither, while now they were about to repair thither with a very vast burnt offering. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/29.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>On the authorities cited see the Introduction. &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493; &#1506;&#1501; goes with &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1501;: the acts of David ... are written ... together with his whole reign and his power, and the times which went over him. &#1492;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, the times, with their joys and sorrows, as in <a href="/psalms/31-16.htm">Psalm 31:16</a>; <a href="/job/24-1.htm">Job 24:1</a>.
