The force of the opening of this verse, and the relation of it to the former, are both prejudiced by the "now" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5d4;</span>) being deposed from its right position as the <span class="accented">first</span> word in the verse.

In using the words, "wisdom and knowledge," Solomon seems to have remembered well the prayer of his father (<a href="/1_chronicles/22-12.htm">1 Chronicles 22:12</a>). (For the pedigree of the simple and effective phrase, "know how to go out and come in," see <a href="/numbers/27-17.htm">Numbers 27:17</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/31-2.htm">Deuteronomy 31:2</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/18-13.htm">1 Samuel 18:13, 16</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/3-25.htm">2 Samuel 3:25</a>). It is at the same time refreshing to revisit the times when the most exalted nominal ruler was also the real ruler, as being the leader, the judge, the teacher in the highest sense, and "the feeder" of his people. Nor is it less refreshing to notice how, in Israel at least, the fact was so well recognized and honoured, that <span class="accented">justice</span> and <span class="accented">to judge just judgment</span> lay at the deepest foundation of civil society. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_chronicles/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The sacrifice at Gibeon, and the theophany. - <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-1.htm">2 Chronicles 1:1-6</a>. When Solomon had established himself upon his throne, he went with the princes and representatives of the congregation of Israel to Gibeon, to seek for the divine blessing upon his reign by a solemn sacrifice to be offered there before the tabernacle. <a href="/2_chronicles/1-1.htm">2 Chronicles 1:1</a> forms, as it were, the superscription of the account of Solomon's reign which follows. In &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1514;&#1495;&#1494;&#1468;&#1511;  equals  Solomon established himself in his kingdom, i.e., he became strong and mighty in his kingdom, the older commentators saw a reference to the defeat of Adonijah, the pretender to the crown, and his followers (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/2.htm">1 Kings 2</a>). But this view of the words is too narrow; we find the same remark made of other kings whose succession to the throne had not been questioned (cf. <a href="/2_chronicles/12-13.htm">2 Chronicles 12:13</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/13-21.htm">2 Chronicles 13:21</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-1.htm">2 Chronicles 17:1</a>, and <a href="/2_chronicles/21-4.htm">2 Chronicles 21:4</a>), and the remark refers to the whole reign-to all that Solomon undertook in order to establish a firm dominion, not merely to his entry upon it. With this view of the words, the second clause, "his God was with him, and made him very great," coincides. God gave His blessing to all that Solomon did for this end. With the last words cf. <a href="/1_chronicles/29-25.htm">1 Chronicles 29:25</a>.<p>We have an account of the sacrifice at Gibeon (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-7.htm">2 Chronicles 1:7-13</a>) in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/3-4.htm">1 Kings 3:4-15</a> also. The two narratives agree in all the main points, but, in so far as their form is concerned, it is at once discernible that they are two independent descriptions of the same thing, but derived from the same sources. In <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/3.htm">1 Kings 3</a> the theophany-in our text, on the contrary, that aspect of the sacrifice which connected it with the public worship-is more circumstantially narrated. While in <a href="/1_kings/3-4.htm">1 Kings 3:4</a> it is briefly said the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there, our historian records that Solomon summoned the princes and representatives of the people to this solemn act, and accompanied by them went to Gibeon. This sacrifice was no mere private sacrifice-it was the religious consecration of the opening of his reign, at which the estates of the kingdom were present as a matter of course. "All Israel" is defined by "the princes over the thousands ..., the judges, and all the honourable;" then &#1500;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500; is again taken up and explained by the apposition &#1492;&#1488;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;: to all Israel, viz., the heads of the fathers'-houses. &#1500; is to be repeated before &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;. What Solomon said to all Israel through its representatives, is not communicated; but it may be gathered from what succeeds, that he summoned them to accompany him to Gibeon to offer the sacrifice. The reason why he offered his sacrifice at the &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492;, i.e., place of sacrifice, is given in <a href="/2_chronicles/1-3.htm">2 Chronicles 1:3</a>. There the Mosaic tabernacle stood, yet without the ark, which David had caused to be brought up from Kirjath-jearim to Jerusalem (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/13-1.htm">1 Chronicles 13:1-14</a> and 15). In &#1500;&#1493; &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1499;&#1497;&#1503; the article in ba represents the relative &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;  equals  &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; or &#1500;&#1493; &#1492;&#1499;&#1497;&#1503; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1511;&#1493;&#1501;; cf. <a href="/judges/5-27.htm">Judges 5:27</a>; <a href="/ruth/1-16.htm">Ruth 1:16</a>; <a href="/1_kings/21-19.htm">1 Kings 21:19</a>; see on <a href="/1_chronicles/26-28.htm">1 Chronicles 26:28</a>. Although the ark was separated from the tabernacle, yet by the latter at Gibeon was the Mosaic altar of burnt-offering, and on that account the sanctuary at Gibeon was Jahve's dwelling, and the legal place of worship for burnt-offerings of national-theocratic import. "As our historian here brings forward emphatically the fact that Solomon offered his burnt-offering at the legal place of worship, so he points out in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-28.htm">1 Chronicles 21:28-30</a> :1, how David was only brought by extraordinary events, and special signs from God, to sacrifice on the altar of burnt-offering erected by him on the threshing-floor of Ornan, and also states how he was prevented from offering his burnt-offering in Gibeon" (Berth.). As to Bezaleel, the maker of the brazen altar, cf. <a href="/exodus/31-2.htm">Exodus 31:2</a> and <a href="/exodus/37-1.htm">Exodus 37:1</a>. Instead of &#1513;&#1474;&#1501;, which most manuscripts and many editions have before &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;, and which the Targ. and Syr. also express, there is found in most editions of the 16th century, and also in manuscripts, &#1513;&#1473;&#1501;, which the lxx and Vulgate also read. The reading &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; is unquestionably better and more correct, and the Masoretic pointing &#1513;&#1474;&#1501;, posuit, has arisen by an undue assimilation of it to <a href="/exodus/40-29.htm">Exodus 40:29</a>. The suffix in &#1497;&#1491;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; does not refer to the altar, but to the preceding word &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;; cf. &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;,   <a href="/1_chronicles/21-30.htm">1 Chronicles 21:30</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-13.htm">1 Chronicles 15:13</a>, etc.</body></html>
