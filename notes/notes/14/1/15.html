Those that pursue present things most eagerly, are likely to be disappointed; while those that refer themselves to the providence of God, if they have not the most, have the most comfort. Those that make this world their end, come short of the other, and are disappointed in this also; but those that make the other world their end, shall not only obtain that, and full satisfaction in it, but shall have as much of this world as is good for them, in their way.

His Strength and Wealth.<p>14. Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen&#8212;His passion for horses was greater than that of any Israelitish monarch before or after him. His stud comprised fourteen hundred chariots and twelve thousand horses. This was a prohibited indulgence, whether as an instrument of luxury or power. But it was not merely for his own use that he imported the horses of Egypt. The immense equestrian establishment he erected was not for show merely, but also for profit. The Egyptian breed of horses was highly valued; and being as fine as the Arabian, but larger and more powerful, they were well fitted for being yoked in chariots. These were light but compact and solid vehicles, without springs. From the price stated (2Ch 1:17) as given for a chariot and a horse, it appears that the chariot cost four times the value of a horse. A horse brought a 150 shekels, which, estimating the shekels at 2s. 3d. or 2s. 6d., amount to &pound;17 2s. or &pound;18 15s., while a chariot brought 600 shekels, equal to &pound;68 9s. or &pound;75; and as an Egyptian chariot was usually drawn by two horses, a chariot and pair would cost &pound;112 sterling. As the Syrians, who were fond of the Egyptian breed of horses, could import them into their own country only through Judea, Solomon early perceived the commercial advantages to be derived from this trade, and established a monopoly. His factors or agents purchased them in the markets or fairs of Egypt and brought them to the "chariot cities," the depots and stables he had erected on the frontiers of his kingdom, such as Bethmarcaboth, "the house of chariots," and Hazarsusah, "the village of horses" (Jos 19:5; 1Ki 10:28).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_chronicles/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then Solomon came from his journey to the high place that was at Gibeon,....

The omission of these words in the parallel (<a href="/1_kings/10-27.htm">1 Kings 10:27</a>) is remarkable in the light of what we read in <a href="/2_chronicles/9-20.htm">2 Chronicles 9:20</a>. We find the contents of this verse again in <a href="/2_chronicles/9-27.htm">2 Chronicles 9:27</a>; as also in the parallel (<a href="/1_kings/10-27.htm">1 Kings 10:27</a>), just quoted with the exception already named. <span class="cmt_word">Cedar trees</span>.

Gesenius, in his 'Lexicon,' <span class="accented">sub voc</span>., may be consulted, and the various Bible dictionaries, especially Dr. Smith's, under "Cedar;" and Dr. Kitto's 'Cyclopaedia,' under "Eres." The writer in Dr. Smith's 'Dictionary' suggests that under the one word "cedar," the <span class="accented">Pinus cedrus, Pinus deodara, Yew, Taxus baccata</span>, and <span class="accented">Pinus sylvestris</span> (Scotch pine) were referred to popularly, and were employed when building purposes are in question. That the said variety was employed is likely enough, but that we are intended to understand this when the word "cedar" is used seems unlikely (see for further indication of this unlikeliness, the instancing of "firs" occasionally with "cedars," <a href="/1_kings/5-10.htm">1 Kings 5:10</a>; <a href="/1_kings/9-11.htm">1 Kings 9:11</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/2-8.htm">2 Chronicles 2:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Sycomore trees</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>).

Now, the former of these trees is the well. known mulberry tree. But the latter is what is called the <span class="accented">fig-mulberry</span>, or the <span class="accented">sycamore-fig</span>; and this is the tree of the Old Testament. Its fruit resembles the fig, grows on sprigs shooting out of the thick stems themselves of the tree, and each fruit needs to be <span class="accented">punctured</span> a few days before gathering, if it is to be acceptable eating (<a href="/amos/7-14.htm">Amos 7:14</a>; <a href="/isaiah/9-10.htm">Isaiah 9:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In the vale</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the lowland country, called the Shefelah.
