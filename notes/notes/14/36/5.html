His extant inscriptions chiefly relate to palace and temple building.

(The LXX., 3 Esdr., Vulg., and Arabic, but not the Syriac, read: “and carried him to Babylon.”) Thenius says this must be the right reading, and then denies its claim to credibility. He further <span class= "ital">asserts</span> that, “in order to allow ample scope for the fulfilment of the prophecy of Jeremiah” (see Note on <a href="/2_chronicles/36-8.htm" title="Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and his abominations which he did, and that which was found in him, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah: and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead.">2Chronicles 36:8</a>), the chronicler has represented Jehoiakim as carried alive to Babylon in the last year of his reign.

The methods God takes to call back sinners by his word, by ministers, by conscience, by providences, are all instances of his compassion toward them, and his unwillingness that any should perish. See here what woful havoc sin makes, and, as we value the comfort and continuance of our earthly blessings, let us keep that worm from the root of them. They had many times ploughed and sowed their land in the seventh year, when it should have rested, and now it lay unploughed and unsown for ten times seven years. God will be no loser in his glory at last, by the disobedience of men. If they refused to let the land rest, God would make it rest.

His character is portrayed with a masterly hand in the prophecy of Jeremiah (Jer 22:13-19).
