The methods God takes to call back sinners by his word, by ministers, by conscience, by providences, are all instances of his compassion toward them, and his unwillingness that any should perish. See here what woful havoc sin makes, and, as we value the comfort and continuance of our earthly blessings, let us keep that worm from the root of them. They had many times ploughed and sowed their land in the seventh year, when it should have rested, and now it lay unploughed and unsown for ten times seven years. God will be no loser in his glory at last, by the disobedience of men. If they refused to let the land rest, God would make it rest. What place, O God, shall thy justice spare, if Jerusalem has perished? If that delight of thine were cut off for wickedness, let us not be high-minded, but fear.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/36.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The fearful slaughter took place at the capture of the city, in the courts of the temple itself (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/9-6.htm">Ezekiel 9:6-7</a>; compare <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/2-7.htm">Lamentations 2:7</a>, <a href="/lamentations/2-20.htm">Lamentations 2:20</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/36.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. who had made him swear by God&#8212;Zedekiah received his crown on the express condition of taking a solemn oath of fealty to the king of Babylon (Eze 17:13); so that his revolt by joining in a league with Pharaoh-hophra, king of Egypt, involved the crime of perjury. His own pride and obdurate impiety, the incurable idolatry of the nation, and their reckless disregard of prophetic warnings, brought down on his already sadly reduced kingdom the long threatened judgments of God. Nebuchadnezzar, the executioner of the divine vengeance, commenced a third siege of Jerusalem, which, after holding out for a year and a half, was taken in the eleventh year of the reign of Zedekiah. It resulted in the burning of the temple, with, most probably, the ark, and in the overthrow of the kingdom of Judah (see on [480]2Ki 25:1-7; [481]Eze 12:13; [482]Eze 17:16).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/36.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_chronicles/36.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And all the vessels of the house of God, great and small,....

Cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/24-18.htm">2 Kings 24:18-25:21</a>. - Zedekiah, made king at the age of twenty-one years, reigned eleven years, and filled up the measure of sins, so that the Lord was compelled to give the kingdom of Judah up to destruction by the Chaldeans. To that Zedekiah brought it by the two main sins of his evil reign, - namely, by not humbling himself before the prophet Jeremiah, from the mouth of Jahve (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-12.htm">2 Chronicles 36:12</a>); and by rebelling against King Nebuchadnezzar, who had caused him to swear by God, and by so hardening his neck (being stiff-necked), and making stout his heart, that he did not return to Jahve the God of Israel. Zedekiah's stiffness of neck and hardness of heart showed itself in his refusing to hearken to the words which Jeremiah spoke to him from the mouth of God, and his breaking the oath he had sworn to Nebuchadnezzar by God. The words, "he humbled himself not before Jeremiah," recall <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-2.htm">Jeremiah 37:2</a>, and the events narrated in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/37.htm">Jeremiah 37</a> and 38, and 21:4-22:9, which show how the chief of the people ill-treated the prophet because of his prophecies, while Zedekiah was too weak and languid to protect him against them. The rebellion against Nebuchadnezzar, to whom he had sworn a vassal's oath of fidelity, is mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/24-20.htm">2 Kings 24:20</a>, and <a href="/ezekiel/17-13.htm">Ezekiel 17:13</a>. also, as a great crime on the part of Zedekiah and the chief of the people; see the commentary on both passages. In consequence of this rebellion, Nebuchadnezzar marched against Judah with a powerful army; and after the capture of the fenced cities of the land, he advanced to the siege of Jerusalem, which ended in its capture and destruction, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/25-1.htm">2 Kings 25:1-10</a>. Without further noticing these results of this breach of faith, the author of the Chronicle proceeds to depict the sins of the king and of the people. In the first place, he again brings forward, in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-13.htm">2 Chronicles 36:13</a>, the stiffness of neck and obduracy of the king, which manifested itself in the acts just mentioned: he made hard his neck, etc. Bertheau would interpret the words &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473;, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-30.htm">Deuteronomy 2:30</a>, thus: "Then did God make him stiff-necked and hardened his heart; so that he did not return to Jahve the God of Israel, notwithstanding the exhortations of the prophets." But although hardening is not seldom represented as inflicted by God, there is here no ground for supposing that with &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473; the subject is changed, while the bringing forward of the hardening as an act of God does not at all suit the context. And, moreover, &#1506;&#1512;&#1507; &#1492;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;, making hard the neck, is nowhere ascribed to God, it is only said of men; cf. <a href="/2_kings/17-14.htm">2 Kings 17:14</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/10-16.htm">Deuteronomy 10:16</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-15.htm">Jeremiah 19:15</a>, etc. To God only &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1500;&#1489; &#1492;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; or &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; is attributed, <a href="/exodus/7-3.htm">Exodus 7:3</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/2-30.htm">Deuteronomy 2:30</a>. </body></html>
