The methods God takes to call back sinners by his word, by ministers, by conscience, by providences, are all instances of his compassion toward them, and his unwillingness that any should perish. See here what woful havoc sin makes, and, as we value the comfort and continuance of our earthly blessings, let us keep that worm from the root of them. They had many times ploughed and sowed their land in the seventh year, when it should have rested, and now it lay unploughed and unsown for ten times seven years. God will be no loser in his glory at last, by the disobedience of men. If they refused to let the land rest, God would make it rest. What place, O God, shall thy justice spare, if Jerusalem has perished? If that delight of thine were cut off for wickedness, let us not be high-minded, but fear.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/36.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The narrative runs parallel with 2 Kings marginal reference) as far as <a href="/2_chronicles/36-13.htm">2 Chronicles 36:13</a>.

The prophet Jeremiah composed a lamentation for Josiah: "and all the singing-men and singing-women spake in their lamentations of Josiah unto this day;" i.e., in the lamentation which they were wont to sing on certain fixed days, they sung also the lamentation for Josiah. "And they made them (these lamentations) an ordinance (a standing custom) in Israel, and they are written in the lamentations," i.e., in a collection of lamentations, in which, among others, that composed by Jeremiah on the death of Josiah was contained. This collection is, however, not to be identified with the Lamentations of Jeremiah over the destruction of Jerusalem and the kingdom of Judah, contained in our canon. - On <a href="/2_chronicles/35-26.htm">2 Chronicles 35:26</a>. cf. <a href="/2_kings/23-28.htm">2 Kings 23:28</a>. &#1492;&#1505;&#1491;&#1497;&#1493; as in <a href="/2_chronicles/32-32.htm">2 Chronicles 32:32</a>. &#1489;&#1514; &#1499;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;, according to that which is written in the law of Moses, cf. <a href="/2_chronicles/31-3.htm">2 Chronicles 31:3</a>. &#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493; is the continuation of &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497; &#1497;&#1514;&#1512; (<a href="/2_chronicles/35-26.htm">2 Chronicles 35:26</a>). </body></html>
