The methods God takes to call back sinners by his word, by ministers, by conscience, by providences, are all instances of his compassion toward them, and his unwillingness that any should perish. See here what woful havoc sin makes, and, as we value the comfort and continuance of our earthly blessings, let us keep that worm from the root of them. They had many times ploughed and sowed their land in the seventh year, when it should have rested, and now it lay unploughed and unsown for ten times seven years. God will be no loser in his glory at last, by the disobedience of men. If they refused to let the land rest, God would make it rest. What place, O God, shall thy justice spare, if Jerusalem has perished?

His own pride and obdurate impiety, the incurable idolatry of the nation, and their reckless disregard of prophetic warnings, brought down on his already sadly reduced kingdom the long threatened judgments of God. Nebuchadnezzar, the executioner of the divine vengeance, commenced a third siege of Jerusalem, which, after holding out for a year and a half, was taken in the eleventh year of the reign of Zedekiah. It resulted in the burning of the temple, with, most probably, the ark, and in the overthrow of the kingdom of Judah (see on [480]2Ki 25:1-7; [481]Eze 12:13; [482]Eze 17:16).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/36.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The people transgressed very much; </span> they were universally corrupt, and therefore God justly brought upon them a general destruction. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_chronicles/36.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Moreover, the chief of the priests, and of the people, transgressed very much after all the abominations of the Heathens,....

S. 56) the king of Babylon, and bound him with brazen double fetters to carry him to Babylon." This campaign, Nebuchadnezzar's first against Judah, is spoken of also in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/24.htm">2 Kings 24</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/1-1.htm">Daniel 1:1-2</a>. The capture of Jerusalem, at which Jehoiakim was put in fetters, occurred, as we learn from <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/1-1.htm">Daniel 1:1</a>, col. c. <a href="/jeremiah/46-2.htm">Jeremiah 46:2</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-7.htm">Jeremiah 36:7</a>, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim's reign, i.e., in the year 606 b.c.; and with it commence the seventy years of the Chaldean servitude of Judah. Nebuchadnezzar did not carry out his purpose of deporting the captured king Jehoiakim to Babylon, but allowed him to continue to reign at Jerusalem as his servant (vassal). To alter the infin. &#1500;&#1492;&#1493;&#1500;&#1497;&#1499;&#1493; into the perf., or to translate as the perf., is quite arbitrary, as is also the supplying of the words, "and he carried him away to Babylon." That the author of the Chronicle does not mention the actual carrying away, but rather assumes the contrary, namely, that Jehoiakim continued to reign in Jerusalem until his death, as well known, is manifest from the way in which, in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-8.htm">2 Chronicles 36:8</a>, he records his son's accession to the throne. He uses the same formula which he has used in the case of all the kings whom at their death their sons succeeded, according to established custom. Had Nebuchadnezzar dethroned Jehoiakim, as Necho deposed Jehoahaz, the author of the Chronicle would not have left the installation of Jehoiachin by the Chaldean king unmentioned. For the defence of this view against opposing opinions, see the commentary on <a href="/2_kings/24-1.htm">2 Kings 24:1</a> and <a href="/daniel/1-1.htm">Daniel 1:1</a>; and in regard to <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-7.htm">2 Chronicles 36:7</a>, see on <a href="/daniel/1-2.htm">Daniel 1:2</a>. The Chronicle narrates nothing further as to Jehoiakim's reign, but refers, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-8.htm">2 Chronicles 36:8</a>, for his other deeds, and especially his abominations, to the book of the kings of Israel and Judah, whence the most important things have been excerpted and incorporated in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/24-1.htm">2 Kings 24:1-4</a>. &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1506;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493; Bertheau interprets of images which he caused to be prepared, and &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1502;&#1510;&#1488; of his evil deeds; but in both he is incorrect. The passages which Bertheau cites for his interpretation of the first words, <a href="/jeremiah/7-9.htm">Jeremiah 7:9</a>. and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-17.htm">Ezekiel 8:17</a>, prove the contrary; for Jeremiah mentions as &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1506;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; of the people, murder, adultery, false swearing, offering incense to Baal, and going after other gods; and Ezekiel, loc. cit., uses &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1506;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1514; of the idolatry of the people indeed, but not of the making of images - only of the worship of idols, the practice of idol-worship. The abominations, consequently, which Jehoiakim committed are both his evil deeds and crimes, e.g., the shedding of innocent blood (<a href="/2_kings/24-4.htm">2 Kings 24:4</a>), as well as the idolatry which he had practised. &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1502;&#1510;&#1488;, "what was found upon him," is a comprehensive designation of his whole moral and religious conduct and attitude; cf. <a href="/2_chronicles/19-3.htm">2 Chronicles 19:3</a>. Jehoiakim's revolt from Nebuchadnezzar after three years' servitude (<a href="/2_kings/24-1.htm">2 Kings 24:1</a>) is passed over by the author of the Chronicle, because the punishment of this crime influenced the fate of the kingdom of Judah only after his death. The punishment fell upon Jehoiachin; for the detachments of Arameans, Moabites, and Ammonites, which were sent by Nebuchadnezzar to punish the rebels, did not accomplish much. </body></html>
