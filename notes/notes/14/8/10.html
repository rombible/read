The difficulty is increased, when a man has a hinderance instead of a help meet in the wife of his bosom. Solomon kept up the holy sacrifices, according to the law of Moses. In vain had the altar been built, in vain had fire come down from heaven, if sacrifices had not been constantly brought. Spiritual sacrifices are required of us, which we are to bring daily and weekly; it is good to be in a settled method of devotion. When the service of the temple was put into good order, it is said, The house of the Lord was perfected. The work was the main matter, not the place; the temple was unfinished till all this was done. Canaan was a rich country, and yet must send to Ophir for gold The Israelites were a wise people, but must be beholden to the king of Tyre for men that had knowledge of the seas. Grace, and not gold, is the best riches, and acquaintance with God and his law, the best knowledge. Leaving the children of this world to scramble for the toys of this world, may we, as the children of God, lay up our treasure in heaven, that where our treasure is, our hearts also may be.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>On the number compare <a href="/1_kings/5-16.htm">1 Kings 5:16</a> note. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. two hundred and fifty that bare rule&#8212;(Compare 1Ki 9:23).

The unusual position of the words is the result of the aphoristic character of the notice. As to its relation to the statement <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/9-10.htm">1 Kings 9:10-13</a>, see the discussion on that passage. &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492;, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-2.htm">2 Chronicles 8:2</a>, is not to be understood of the fortification of these cities, but of their completion, for, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/9-10.htm">1 Kings 9:10</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/9-13.htm">1 Kings 9:13</a>, they were in very bad condition. &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;, he caused to dwell there, i.e., transplanted Israelites thither, cf. <a href="/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6</a>. The account of the cities which Solomon built, i.e., fortified, is introduced (<a href="/2_chronicles/8-3.htm">2 Chronicles 8:3</a>) by the important statement, omitted in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/9.htm">1 Kings 9</a>:"Solomon went to Hamath-zobah, and prevailed against it." &#1506;&#1500; &#1495;&#1494;&#1511;, to be strong upon, that is, prevail against, conquer; cf. <a href="/2_chronicles/27-5.htm">2 Chronicles 27:5</a>. Hamath-zobah is not the city Hamath in Zobah, but, as we learn from <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-4.htm">2 Chronicles 8:4</a>, the land or kingdom of Hamath. This did not lie, any more than the city Hamath, in Zobah, but bordered on the kingdom of Zobah: cf. <a href="/1_chronicles/18-3.htm">1 Chronicles 18:3</a>; and as to the position of Zobah, see the Commentary on <a href="/2_samuel/8-3.htm">2 Samuel 8:3</a>. In David's time Hamath and Zobah had their own kings; and David conquered them, and made their kingdoms tributary (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18-3.htm">1 Chronicles 18:3-10</a>). Because they bordered on each other, Hamath and Zobah are here bound together as a nomen compos. &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492; &#1497;&#1495;&#1494;&#1511; signifies at least this, that these tributary kingdoms had either rebelled against Solomon, or at least had made attempts to do so; which Solomon suppressed, and in order to establish his dominion over them fortified Tadmor, i.e., Palmyra, and all the store cities in the land of Hamath (see on <a href="/1_kings/9-18.htm">1 Kings 9:18</a>.); for, according to <a href="/1_kings/11-23.htm">1 Kings 11:23</a>., he had Rezon of Zobah as an enemy during his whole reign; see on that passage.</body></html>
