The difficulty is increased, when a man has a hinderance instead of a help meet in the wife of his bosom. Solomon kept up the holy sacrifices, according to the law of Moses. In vain had the altar been built, in vain had fire come down from heaven, if sacrifices had not been constantly brought. Spiritual sacrifices are required of us, which we are to bring daily and weekly; it is good to be in a settled method of devotion. When the service of the temple was put into good order, it is said, The house of the Lord was perfected. The work was the main matter, not the place; the temple was unfinished till all this was done. Canaan was a rich country, and yet must send to Ophir for gold The Israelites were a wise people, but must be beholden to the king of Tyre for men that had knowledge of the seas. Grace, and not gold, is the best riches, and acquaintance with God and his law, the best knowledge. Leaving the children of this world to scramble for the toys of this world, may we, as the children of God, lay up our treasure in heaven, that where our treasure is, our hearts also may be.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Of Pharaoh - Here again the writer of Chronicles assumes in his reader a knowledge of the facts recorded in the marginal references <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh out of the city of David unto the house that he had built for her&#8212;On his marriage with the Egyptian princess at the beginning of his reign, he assigned her a temporary abode in the city of David, that is, Jerusalem, until a suitable palace for his wife had been erected. While that palace was in progress, he himself lodged in the palace of David, but he did not allow her to occupy it, because he felt that she being a heathen proselyte, and having brought from her own country an establishment of heathen maid-servants, there would have been an impropriety in her being domiciled in a mansion which was or had been hallowed by the reception of the ark. It seems she was received on her arrival into his mother's abode (So 3:4; 8:2).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Not because every place where once the ark came was thereby consecrated to God, and night not after the ark was gone be put to any common use; for then both the house of Obed-edom and all other places where the ark either rested or passed were made holy thereby, and unlawful for men to dwell in; but either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. Because she was a woman, and attended by many other women, who besides the common pollutions of all, are subject to many and frequent ceremonial pollutions peculiar to their sex, and either she, or at least many of her followers, might be heathens at this time; and therefore he thought it indecent that such persons should come as it were in God’s stead, and succeed him in the place where he had dwelt.
