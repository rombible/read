He and his people offered sacrifices to God; thanksgiving for the favours they had received, and supplication for further favours. Prayers and praises are now our spiritual sacrifices. The people, of their own will, covenanted to seek the Lord, each for himself, with earnestness. What is religion but seeking God, inquiring after him, applying to him upon all occasions? We make nothing of our religion, if we do not make heart-work of it; God will have all the heart, or none. Our devotedness to God our Saviour, should be avowed and shown in the most solemn and public manner.

The assembled worshippers entered with great and holy enthusiasm into a national covenant "to seek the Lord their God &#8230; with all their heart and with all their soul;" and, at the same time, to execute with rigor the laws which made idolatry punishable with death (2Ch 15:13; De 17:2-5; Heb 10:28).

It is possible, but scarcely tenable, that, by Israel, the northern kingdom may be here intended. But for the apparent discrepancy with those places which say that Asa <span class="accented">did</span> take away "the high places" (<a href="/2_chronicles/14-3.htm">2 Chronicles 14:3, 5</a>), see notes under them, and &sect;7. 1, pp. 16, 17, of 'Introduction to 1 Chronicles.' "The high places" were hills on which sacrifices were illegitimately offered instead of at the chosen place - at Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">The heart of Asa was perfect all his days</span>. The words, "with Jehovah," following after the word "perfect" in the parallel (<a href="/1_kings/15-17.htm">1 Kings 15:17</a>), makes the already plain plainer. The exact meaning is that Asa was consistently free from idolatry to the end. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_chronicles/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>At this festival, which was held on the third month of the fifteenth year of Asa's reign, they offered of the booty, i.e., of the cattle captured in the war against the Cushites (<a href="/2_chronicles/14-14.htm">2 Chronicles 14:14</a>), 700 oxen and 7000 sheep. &#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; &#1502;&#1503;&#1470;&#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1500;&#1500; defines the &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1494;&#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468; more closely: they sacrificed, viz., from the booty they offered. From this it seems to follow that the sacrificial festival was held soon after the return from the war against the Cushites. The attack of the Cushite Zerah upon Judah can only have occurred in the eleventh year of Asa, according to <a href="/2_chronicles/14-1.htm">2 Chronicles 14:1</a>; but it is not stated how long the war lasted, nor when Asa returned to Jerusalem (<a href="/2_chronicles/14-14.htm">2 Chronicles 14:14</a>) after conquering the enemy and plundering the towns of the south land. But Asa may quite well have remained longer in the south after the Cushites had been driven back, in order again firmly to establish his rule there; and on his return to Jerusalem, in consequence of the exhortation of the prophet Azariah, may have straightway determined to hold a sacrificial festival at which the whole people should renew the covenant with the Lord, and have set apart and reserved a portion of the captured cattle for this purpose. </body></html>
