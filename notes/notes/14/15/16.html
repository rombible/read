The people, of their own will, covenanted to seek the Lord, each for himself, with earnestness. What is religion but seeking God, inquiring after him, applying to him upon all occasions? We make nothing of our religion, if we do not make heart-work of it; God will have all the heart, or none.

The attack of the Cushite Zerah upon Judah can only have occurred in the eleventh year of Asa, according to <a href="/2_chronicles/14-1.htm">2 Chronicles 14:1</a>; but it is not stated how long the war lasted, nor when Asa returned to Jerusalem (<a href="/2_chronicles/14-14.htm">2 Chronicles 14:14</a>) after conquering the enemy and plundering the towns of the south land. But Asa may quite well have remained longer in the south after the Cushites had been driven back, in order again firmly to establish his rule there; and on his return to Jerusalem, in consequence of the exhortation of the prophet Azariah, may have straightway determined to hold a sacrificial festival at which the whole people should renew the covenant with the Lord, and have set apart and reserved a portion of the captured cattle for this purpose. </body></html>
