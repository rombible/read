He and his people offered sacrifices to God; thanksgiving for the favours they had received, and supplication for further favours. Prayers and praises are now our spiritual sacrifices. The people, of their own will, covenanted to seek the Lord, each for himself, with earnestness. What is religion but seeking God, inquiring after him, applying to him upon all occasions? We make nothing of our religion, if we do not make heart-work of it; God will have all the heart, or none. Our devotedness to God our Saviour, should be avowed and shown in the most solemn and public manner.

Now for a long season Israel hath been without the true God, &c.&#8212;Some think that Azariah was referring to the sad and disastrous condition to which superstition and idolatry had brought the neighboring kingdom of Israel. His words should rather be taken in a wider sense, for it seems manifest that the prophet had his eye upon many periods in the national history, when the people were in the state described&#8212;a state of spiritual destitution and ignorance&#8212;and exhibited its natural result as widespread anarchy, mutual dissension among the tribes, and general suffering (Jud 9:23; 12:4; 20:21; 2Ch 13:17). These calamities God permitted to befall them as the punishment of their apostasy. Azariah's object in these remarks was to establish the truth of his counsel (2Ch 15:2), threatening, in case of neglecting it by describing the uniform course of the divine procedure towards Israel, as shown in all periods of their history. Then after this appeal to national experience, he concluded with an earnest exhortation to the king to prosecute the work of reformation so well begun [2Ch 15:7].<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">When they did turn, </span> i.e. Israel, mentioned <span class="bld"><a href="/2_chronicles/15-3.htm" title="Now for a long season Israel has been without the true God, and without a teaching priest, and without law.">2 Chronicles 15:3</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_chronicles/15.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But when they in their trouble did turn unto the Lord God of Israel,....
