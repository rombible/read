A various reading in the Hebrew gives, "he pursues after words, and these he shall have" - i. e., these, and nothing else.<p>This and other like maxims do not in reality cast scorn and shame on a state which Christ has pronounced "blessed." Side by side with them is <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/19-1.htm">Proverbs 19:1</a>, setting forth the honor of an upright poverty. But as there is an honorable poverty, so there is one which is altogether inglorious, caused by sloth and folly, leading to shame and ignominy, and it is well that the man who wishes to live rightly should avoid this. The teaching of Christ is, of course, higher than that of the Book of Proverbs, being based upon a fuller revelation of the divine will, pointing to a higher end and a nobler standard of duty, and transcending the common motives and common facts of life. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/19.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5.

They despise him on account of his poverty; they neglect him, and do not take care of him; they reckon him a reproach unto them, and do not choose to own him; all which may be interpreted an hatred of him; <p>how much more do his friends go far from him? or "his friend", every one of his friends; or "his neighbour" (l): for if his brethren, who are his own flesh and blood, show so much disrespect unto him; much more will those who are only his neighbours, or were in friendship with him while in prosperity; these wilt stand at a distance from him, and not come near him, now he is poor and in distress; see <a href="/job/19-13.htm">Job 19:13</a>; <p>he pursueth them with words; yet they are wanting to him; or, "they are not" (m); he presses them with earnest entreaties to relieve him; he urges their own words and promises, and fetches arguments from them, and uses them as far as they will go; but all signifies nothing; his own words and petitions are to no purpose; and their words and promises are all smoke and vapour, vain and empty. Some understand this, as Gersom, not of the poor man that follows vain words (n) and empty promises, and buoys himself up with them that such an one and such an one has promised to be his friend, of which nothing comes; but of the friend that separates from the poor man, and pursues him with words of accusation, charging it on him as hit own fault that he is poor; which accusations are not true. This is one of the fifteen places observed by the Masoretes, in which it is written  "not", and read  "to him": both may be retained, and read, "they are not to him" (o); not profitable to him; either his own words, his petitions; or the words of others, their promises. <p>(l) "amicus ejus", Vatablus; "ominis amicus", Cocceius; i.e. "quisque amicorum ejus", Michaelis.

The third line, corrected by the Septuagint, which has an addition here, runs into two clauses (Cheyne). <span class="cmt_word">All the brethren of the poor do hate him.</span> Even his own brothers, children of the same parents, hate and shun a poor man (<a href="/proverbs/14-20.htm">Proverbs 14:20</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Much more do his friends go far from him.</span> There should be no interrogation. We have the expression (<span class="accented">aph-ki</span>) in <a href="/proverbs/11-31.htm">Proverbs 11:31</a>; <a href="/proverbs/15-11.htm">Proverbs 15:11</a>, etc. Euripides, 'Medea,' 561 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Each single friend far from the poor man flies."</span> Septuagint. "Every one who hateth a poor brother will be also far from friendship." Then follows an addition not found m the Hebrew, "Good thought draweth nigh to those who know it, and a prudent man will find it. He who doeth much evil brings malice to perfection (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>); and he who rouses words to anger shall not be safe." <span class="cmt_word">He pursueth them with words, yet they are wanting to him;</span> or, <span class="accented">they are gone.</span> He makes a pathetic appeal to his quondam friends, but they hearken not to him. But the sense is rather, "He pursueth after, craves for, words of kindness or promises of help, and there is naught, or he gets words only and no material aid." Wordsworth quotes Catullus, 'Carm.,' 38:5 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Quem tu, quod minimum facillimumque est,<br />Qua solatus es adlocutione?<br />Irascor tibi. Sic meos amores?"</span> Vulgate, <span class="accented">Qui tantum verba sectatur, nihil habebit</span>, "He who pursues words only shall have naught." The Hebrew is literally, "Seeking words, they are not" This is according to the Khetib; the Keri, instead of the negation <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d0;</span>, reads <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d5;</span>, which makes the clause signify, "He who pursues words, they are to him;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he gets words and nothing else. Delitzsch and others, supplying the lost member from the Septuagint, read the third line thus: "He that hath many friends, or the friend of every one, is requited with evil; and he that seeketh (fair) speeches shall not be delivered." Cheyne also makes a distich of this line, taking the Septuagint as representing the  original reading, "He that does much evil perfects mischief: He that provokes with words shall not escape." That something has fallen out of the Hebrew text is evident; it seems that there are no examples of tristichs in this part of our book, though they are not unknown in the first and third divisions. The Vulgate surmounts the difficulty by connecting this third line with the following verse, which thus is made to form the antithesis, <span class="accented">Qui tantum verba sectatur, nihil habebit</span>; <span class="accented">Qui autem possessor est mentis, diligit animam suam, et custos prudentiae inveniet bona."</span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/19.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The plur. &#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/18-24.htm">Proverbs 18:24</a>, is emphatic and equivalent to &#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;. The group <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/19-1.htm">Proverbs 19:1-4</a> closes with a proverb which contains this catchword. The first proverb of the group comes by &#1513;&#1474;&#1508;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493; into contact with <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/18-20.htm">Proverbs 18:20</a>, the first proverb of the preceding group.<p>1 Better a poor man walking in his innocence,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Than one with perverse lips, and so a fool.<p>The contrast, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/28-6.htm">Proverbs 28:6</a>, is much clearer. But to correct this proverb in conformity with that, as Hitzig does, is unwarrantable. The Syr., indeed, translates here as there; but the Chald. assimilates this translation to the Heb. text, which Theodotion, and after him the Syro-Hexapl., renders by &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#768;&#x3c1; &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;. But does 1a form a contrast to 1b? Fleischer remarks: "From the contrast it appears that he who is designated in 1b must be thought of as &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1512;" [rich]; and Ewald, "Thus early the ideas of a rich man and of a fool, or a despiser of God, are connected together." Saadia understands &#1499;&#1505;&#1497;&#1500; [a fool], after <a href="//biblehub.com/job/31-24.htm">Job 31:24</a>, of one who makes riches his &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1500; [confidence]. Euchel accordingly translates: the false man, although he builds himself greatly up, viz., on his riches. But &#1499;&#1505;&#1497;&#1500; designates the intellectually slothful, in whom the flesh overweighs the mind. And the representation of the rich, which, for 1b certainly arises out of 1a, does not amalgamate with &#1499;&#1505;&#1497;&#1500; htiw , but with &#1506;&#1511;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; &#1513;&#1474;&#1508;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493;. Arama is on the right track, for he translates: the rich who distorts his mouth, for he gives to the poor suppliant a rude refusal. Better Zckler: a proud man of perverse lips and haughty demeanour. If one with haughty, scornful lips is opposed to the poor, then it is manifestly one not poor who thinks to raise himself above the poor, and haughtily looks down on him. And if it is said that, in spite of this proud demeanour, he is a fool, then this presents the figure of one proud of his wealth, who, in spite of his emptiness and nequitia, imagines that he possesses a greatness of knowledge, culture, and worth corresponding to the greatness of his riches. How much better is a poor man than such an one who walketh (vid., on &#1514;&#1468;&#1501;, vol. i, p. 79) in his innocence and simplicity, with his pure mind wholly devoted to God and to that which is good! - his poverty keeps him in humility which is capable of no malicious conduct; and this pious blameless life is of more worth than the pride of wisdom of the distinguished fool. There is in contrast to &#1506;&#1511;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; a simplicity, &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;, of high moral worth; but, on the other side, there is also a simplicity which is worthless. This is the connecting thought which introduces the next verse. </body></html>
