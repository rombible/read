It is far better to have a heart to do good, and want ability for it, than to have ability for it, and want a heart to it. 23.

Some about civil things; to get wealth and riches: to obtain honour and glory among men; to attain to a long life, and to perpetuate their memories after death: some about sinful things; to gratify their carnal lusts and sensual appetites; and to do mischief to others, particularly the people of God, and the cause and interest of Christ: some about religious things; coming new doctrines, devising new ordinances and modes of worship; contriving other methods of salvation than by Christ; as by the light of nature; by the law of Moses; by mere morality, civility, and external justice between man and man; by keeping to the religion they were born and brought up in; and by a mere outward profession of religion, and submission to ordinances, and performance of duties, and a multitude more of the like kind; <p>nevertheless, the counsel of the Lord, that shall stand; and can never be frustrated by the devices of man's heart, though there are many, and that but one; see <a href="/psalms/33-10.htm">Psalm 33:10</a>. This may be applied to the Gospel, and the scheme of salvation in it, called the whole counsel of God, <a href="/acts/20-27.htm">Acts 20:27</a>; it being the fruit of infinite wisdom, and the effect of a divine council between the eternal Three, and full of the best advice and instructions to the sons of men; and which has stood, and shall stand, notwithstanding the persecutions of wicked men, the craft of false teachers, and the ridicule of a profane world; it will continue till all the elect are gathered in, even, to the end of the world; and so will the ordinances of it, which are also called the counsel of God, <a href="/luke/7-30.htm">Luke 7:30</a>; and which will continue till the second coming of Christ. Moreover, the purposes of God, his counsels of old, or his eternal decrees, may be here meant; which are wisely formed in his own breast, and are not frustrable; and according to which counsel of his will all things are done in nature, providence, and grace; all things in this world are ordered as he pleases, and all things are done as he has ordered them; all his purposes are or will be fulfilled; his designs will be accomplished in the world and in his church, in spite of all the schemes, contrivances, and opposition of men and devils. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/19.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><i>There are</i> many devices in a <span class="cverse3">{g}</span> man's heart; nevertheless the counsel of the LORD, that shall stand.</span><p>(g) Man's device will not have success, unless God governs it, whose purpose is unchangeable.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - The immutability of the counsel of God is contrasted with the shifting, fluctuating purposes of man (comp. <a href="/proverbs/16-1.htm">Proverbs 16:1, 9</a>; <a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>; <a href="/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a>). Aben Ezra connects this verse with the preceding, as though it gave the reason for the advice contained therein.

In 15b the fut. denotes that which will certainly happen, the inevitable. In both of its members the proverb is perfectly clear; Hitzig, however, corrects 15a, and brings out of it the meaning, "slothfulness gives tasteless herbs to eat." The lxx has two translations of this proverb, here and at <a href="/proverbs/18-8.htm">Proverbs 18:8</a>. That it should translate &#1512;&#1502;&#1497;&#1492; by &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; was necessary, as Lagarde remarks, for the exposition of the "works of a Hebrew Sotades." But the Hebrew literature never sunk to such works, wallowing in the mire of sensuality, and &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; is not at all thus enigmatical; the Greek word was also used of an effeminate man, a man devoid of manliness, a weakling, and was, as the lxx shows, more current in the Alexandrine Greek than elsewhere. </body></html>
