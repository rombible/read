It is far better to have a heart to do good, and want ability for it, than to have ability for it, and want a heart to it. 23. Those that live in the fear of God, shall get safety, satisfaction, and true and complete happiness. 24. Indolence, when indulged, so grows upon people, that they have no heart to do the most needful things for themselves. 25. A gentle rebuke goes farthest with a man of understanding. 26.

The scorner is hardened to all reproof, and is beyond all hope of being reformed by punishment; in his case it is retribution for outraged virtue that is sought in the penalty which he is made to pay. <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> - retributive, not corrective punishment. Seeing this, the simple, who is not yet confirmed in evil, and is still open to better influences, may be led to take warning and amend his life. So St. Paul enjoins Timothy, "Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear" (<a href="/1_timothy/5-20.htm">1 Timothy 5:20</a>).

Theodotion, the Venet., and Luther render the Ker&#305;&#770; &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1500;&#1470;; Jerome's impatiens is colourless. The Cheth&#305;&#770;b &#1490;&#1512;&#1500; gives no appropriate meaning. The Arab. jaril means lapidosus (whence &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;&#1500;, cf. Aram. &#1508;&#1468;&#1505;&#1468;&#1488;  equals  &#x3c8;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;), and Schultens translates accordingly aspere scruposus iracundiae, which is altogether after the manner of his own heavy style. Ewald translates &#1490;&#1468;&#1512;&#1500; as derived from the Arab jazyl, largus, grandis; but the possibility of the passing over of &#1512; into &#1494;, as maintained by Ewald and also by Hitzig, or the reverse, is physiologically undemonstrable, and is confirmed by no example worthy of mention. Rather it may be possible that the Heb. had an adj. &#1490;&#1468;&#1512;&#1500; or &#1490;&#1468;&#1512;&#1500; in the sense of stony, gravel-like, hard as gravel, but tow rather than gravel would be appropriate to &#1495;&#1502;&#1492;. Hitzig corrects &#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1500; &#1495;&#1502;&#1492;, "who acts in anger;" but he says &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1501; &#1495;&#1502;&#1492;, to recompense anger, <a href="/isaiah/59-18.htm">Isaiah 59:18</a>; &#1490;&#1502;&#1500; &#1495;&#1502;&#1492; is without support. This correction, however, is incomparably more feasible than Bttcher's, "moderate inheritance bears expiation;" &#1495;&#1502;&#1492;  equals  &#1495;&#1502;&#1488;&#1492; must mean not only thick [curdled] milk, but also moderation, and Bttcher finds this "sound." From all these instances one sees that &#1490;&#1512;&#1500; is an error in transcription; the Ker&#305;&#770; &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1500;&#1470;&#1495;&#1502;&#1492; rightly improves it, a man is thus designated whose peculiarity it is to fall into a high degree of passionate anger (&#1495;&#1502;&#1492; &#1490;&#1491;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492;, <a href="/daniel/11-44.htm">Daniel 11:44</a>): such an one has to bear &#1506;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;, a fine, i.e., to compensate, for he has to pay compensation or smart-money for the injury suffered, as e.g., he who in strife with another pushes against a woman with child, so that injury befalls her, <a href="/exodus/21-22.htm">Exodus 21:22</a>. If we compare this passage with <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-6.htm">2 Samuel 14:6</a>, there appears for &#1514;&#1468;&#1510;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500; the meaning of taking away of the object (whether a person or a thing) against which the passionate hothead directs himself. Therewith the meaning of &#1493;&#1506;&#1493;&#1491; &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1505;&#1507; accords. The meaning is not that, &#1492;&#1510;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;, once is not enough, but much rather must be repeated, and yet is without effect; but that one only increases and heightens the &#1495;&#1502;&#1492; thereby. It is in vain to seek to spare such a violent person the punishment into which he obstinately runs; much more advisable is it to let him rage till he ceases; violent opposition only makes the evil the greater. With &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1488;&#1501;, "denn wenn" [for then], cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/2-3.htm">Proverbs 2:3</a>, "ja wenn" [yea if], and with &#1493;&#1506;&#1493;&#1491; in the conclusion, <a href="/job/14-7.htm">Job 14:7</a> (a parallelism syntactically more appropriate than <a href="/psalms/139-18.htm">Psalm 139:18</a>).</body></html>
