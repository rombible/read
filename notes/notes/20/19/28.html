Such a man will lie and slander with the utmost pleasure, living and battening on wickedness.

In any case it lies nearer to interpret &#1514;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;, in relation to man, actively than passively: that which makes man worthy of desire (Rashi), adorns and distinguishes him (Kimchi, Aben-Ezra); or, that which is desired by man, is above all things sought for (Luzzatto); and, in like manner, the Heb. meaning for &#1495;&#1505;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493; lies nearer than the Aram. (vid., <a href="/proverbs/14-34.htm">Proverbs 14:34</a>): the pleasure of a man is his disgrace (Ralbag). Thus Bertheau's translation: the desire of a man is his charitas, must mean: that which brings to a man true joy is to act amiably. But is that, thus generally expressed, true? And if this were the thought, how much more correctly and distinctly would it be expressed by &#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1495;&#1492; &#1500;&#1488;&#1491;&#1501; &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1514; &#1495;&#1505;&#1491; (cf. <a href="/proverbs/21-15.htm">Proverbs 21:15</a>)! Hitzig so rightly reminded by &#1495;&#1505;&#1491;&#1493; of the Pharisee who thanks God that he is not as other men; the word ought to have been &#1495;&#1505;&#1491; to remove every trace of self-satisfaction. Hitzig therefore proposes from the lxx and the Vulgate the text-correction &#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514; no, and translates, "from the revenue of a man is his kind gift;" and Ewald, who is satisfied with &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514;, "the gain of a man is his pious love." The latter is more judicious: &#1495;&#1505;&#1491; (love) distributed is in reality gain (according to <a href="/proverbs/19-17.htm">Proverbs 19:17</a>); but 22b corresponds rather with the former: "better is he who from want does not give &#1514;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488;&#1492;, than he who could give and says he has nothing." But was there then need for that &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; of the lxx? If a poor man is better than a lord given to lying - for &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; with &#1512;&#1513;&#1473; is a man of means and position - i.e., a poor man who would give willingly, but has nothing, than that man who will not give, and therefore lies, saying that he has nothing; then 22a means that the will of a man (cf. &#1514;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;, <a href="/proverbs/11-23.htm">Proverbs 11:23</a>) is his doing good (vid., regarding &#1495;&#1505;&#1491;, ad <a href="/proverbs/3-3.htm">Proverbs 3:3</a>), i.e., is its soul and very essence. Euchel, who accordingly translates: the philanthropy of a man consists properly in his goodwill, rightly compares the Rabbinical proverb, &#1488;&#1495;&#1491; &#1492;&#1502;&#1512;&#1489;&#1492; &#1493;&#1488;&#1495;&#1491; &#1492;&#1502;&#1502;&#1506;&#1497;&#1496; &#1493;&#1489;&#1500;&#1489;&#1491; &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514;&#1489;&#1493;&#1493;&#1503;, i.e., one may give more or less, it all depends on the intention, the disposition. </body></html>
