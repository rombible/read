Men run into troubles by their own folly, and then fret at the appointments of God. 4. Here we may see how strong is men's love of money. 5. Those that tell lies in discourse, are in a fair way to be guilty of bearing false-witness. 6. We are without excuse if we do not love God with all our hearts. His gifts to us are past number, and all the gifts of men to us are fruits of his bounty. 7. Christ was left by all his disciples; but the Father was with him. It encourages our faith that he had so large an experience of the sorrows of poverty. 8. Those only love their souls aright that get true wisdom. 9. Lying is a damning, destroying sin. 10. A man that has not wisdom and grace, has no right or title to true joy. It is very unseemly for one who is a servant to sin, to oppress God's free-men.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Wisdom - literally, as in the margin, to gain a "heart," i. e., the higher faculties both of reason and feeling, is identical with gaining wisdom, i. e., the faculty which seeks and finds. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/19.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8.

The way is here the way of life, the walking: the folly of a man overturns, i.e., destroys, his life's-course; but although he is himself the fabricator of his own ruin, yet the ill-humour (&#1494;&#1506;&#1507;, aestuare, vid., at <a href="/psalms/11-6.htm">Psalm 11:6</a>) of his heart turns itself against God, and he blames (lxx essentially correct: &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;) God instead of himself, viz., his own madness, whereby he has turned the grace of God into lasciviousness, cast to the winds the instruction which lay in His providences, and frustrated the will of God desiring his good. A beautiful paraphrase of this parable is found at Sir. 15:11-20; cf. <a href="/lamentations/3-39.htm">Lamentations 3:39</a>. </body></html>
