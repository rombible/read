The spared and spoiled child is likely to become a man of great wrath. 20. Those that would be wise in their latter end, must be taught and ruled when young. 21. What should we desire, but that all our purposes may agree with God's holy will? 22. It is far better to have a heart to do good, and want ability for it, than to have ability for it, and want a heart to it. 23. Those that live in the fear of God, shall get safety, satisfaction, and true and complete happiness. 24. Indolence, when indulged, so grows upon people, that they have no heart to do the most needful things for themselves. 25. A gentle rebuke goes farthest with a man of understanding. 26.

Or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2.

Either a child that is of a wrathful disposition, and provokes his parent to wrath; or a parent that chastises his child in wrath; each shall suffer for it; or any man that gives way to wrath and anger and is continually quarrelling, he involves himself in trouble; and is punished, as his offence requires, according to law, either in his person or estate; <p>for if thou deliver him, yet thou must do it again; if he is got out of one broil, he will get into another quickly; if he clear of one lawsuit, another will be commenced against him in a short time; if he is discharged and freed from a penalty he is justly subject to, it must be done again and again; he will fall into the same evil, and there is no end of appearing, for him and serving him; a wrathful man brings himself into great trouble, as may be seen in Shimei, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-7.htm">2 Samuel 16:7</a>, <a href="/1_kings/2-46.htm">1 Kings 2:46</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/19.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">A man of great wrath shall suffer punishment: for if thou <span class="cverse3">{f}</span> deliver <i>him</i>, yet thou must do it again.</span><p>(f) Though for a time he gives place to counsel, yet soon after will he give place to his raging affections.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/19.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">19</span>. <span class="ital">do</span> it <span class="ital">again</span>] Because, if you deliver him by paying for him or otherwise ridding him of the “penalty” which his passionate action has brought upon him, his unbridled temper is sure to bring him into trouble again, and so you had better let things take their course.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - Some connect this verse with the preceding, as though it signified, "If you are too severe in chastising your son, you will suffer for it." But there is no connecting particle in the Hebrew, and the statement seems to be of a general nature. <span class="cmt_word">A man of great wrath;</span> literally, <span class="accented">rough in anger</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">impatiens</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;</span>.

Line 2a is expanded, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/27-15.htm">Proverbs 27:15</a>, into a distich. The dropping is &#1496;&#1512;&#1491;, properly striking (cf. Arab. tirad, from tarad III, hostile assault) when it pours itself forth, stroke (drop) after stroke  equals  constantly, or with unbroken continuity. Lightning-flashes are called (Jer Berachoth, p. 114, Shitomir's ed.) &#1496;&#1493;&#1512;&#1491;&#1497;&#1503;, opp. &#1502;&#1508;&#1505;&#1497;&#1511;&#1497;&#1503;, when they do not follow in intervals, but constantly flash; and b.

An old interpreter (vid., R. Ascher in Pesachim II No. 21) explains &#1491;&#1500;&#1507; &#1496;&#1512;&#1491; by: "which drops, and drops, and always drops." An Arab proverb which I once heard from Wetzstein, says that there are three things which make our house intolerable: a&#770;lt&#803;ak&#803;k&#803; ( equals  a&#770;ldhalf), the trickling through of rain; a&#770;lnak&#803;k&#803;, the contention of the wife; and a&#770;lbak&#803;k&#803;, bugs. </body></html>
