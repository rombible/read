A discreet and virtuous wife is more valuable than house and riches. 15. A sluggish, slothful disposition makes men poor; it brings them to want. And this applies both to the present life and that which is to come. 16. If we keep God's word, God's word will keep us from every thing really hurtful. We abuse the doctrine of free grace, if we think that it does away the necessity and advantage of obedience. Those that live at random must die. This truth is clearly taught in words enough to alarm the stoutest sinner. 17. God has chosen the poor of this world, to be rich in faith, and heirs of his kingdom. 18.

Of guiding and keeping him in the right way, as long as corrections are or can be hoped to be of use; while in a state of infancy, childhood, and youth; while under parental government; and before habits in sin are grown strong, and the case become desperate, and he is hardened, and proof against all instruction and discipline; <p>and let not thy soul spare for his crying; the noise he makes, the tears he sheds, the entreaties he uses to keep off the rod; let not a foolish pity and tenderness prevail to lay it aside on that account the consequence of which may be bad to parent and child; see <a href="/proverbs/13-24.htm">Proverbs 13:24</a>. The Targum is, <p>"but unto his death do not lift up thy soul;'' <p>or to the slaying of him (t), as the Vulgate Latin version; and this sense Jarchi gives into: and then the meaning is, that though parents should be careful to give due correction to their children, so long as there is hope of doing them good, yet not in a brutal and barbarous manner, to the endangering of their lives: as some parents are too indolent, mild, and gentle, as Eli was; others are too wrathful and furious and use no moderation in their corrections, but unmercifully beat their children; such extremes ought to be avoided. Gersom interprets the word of crying, as we do. <p>(t)  "ad interficiendum cum", Pagninus, Vatablus, Mercerus, Gejerus; "ad occidendum sum", Piscator, Cocceius, Tigurine version, Michaelis, Schultens, Gussetius, p. 534. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/19.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Chasten thy son while there is hope, and let not thy soul spare for his crying.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/19.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">18</span>. <span class="ital">while</span>] R.V. <span class="ital">seeing:</span> i.e. for if done now it will not be too late.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">let not thy soul spare for his crying</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">set not thy heart on his destruction</span>, R.V.; lit. <span class="bld">on causing him to die</span>.

Christianity recommended moderation in punishment (see <a href="/ephesians/6-4.htm">Ephesians 6:4</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-21.htm">Colossians 3:21</a>).
