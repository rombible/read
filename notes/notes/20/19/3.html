Those that tell lies in discourse, are in a fair way to be guilty of bearing false-witness. 6. We are without excuse if we do not love God with all our hearts. His gifts to us are past number, and all the gifts of men to us are fruits of his bounty. 7. Christ was left by all his disciples; but the Father was with him. It encourages our faith that he had so large an experience of the sorrows of poverty. 8. Those only love their souls aright that get true wisdom. 9. Lying is a damning, destroying sin. 10. A man that has not wisdom and grace, has no right or title to true joy.

Say not thou, He has caused me to err; for he hath no need of the sinful man," etc. The latter part of this important passage St. Augustine quotes thus: "Item apud Salomonem: Deus ab initio constituit hominem et reliquit eum in manu consilii sui: adjecit ei mandata et praecepta; si voles praecepta servare, servabunt te, et in posterum fidem placitam facere. Apposuit tibi aquam et ignem, ad quod vis porrige manum tuam. Ante hominem bonum et malum, vita et mors, paupertas et honestas a Domino Deo sunt" ('De Per. Just. Hom.,' cap. 19, &sect; 41). And again, "Manifestum est, quod si ad ignem manum mittit, et malum ac mors ei placet, id votuntas hominis operatur; si autem bonum et vitam diligit, non solum voluntas id agit, sed divinitus adjuvatur" ('De Gest. Pelag.,' cap. 3, &sect; 7). Homer, 'Od.,' 1:32, etc. - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Perverse mankind! whose wills, created free,<br />Charge all their woes on absolute decree;<br />All to the dooming gods their guilt translate,<br />And follies are miscalled the crimes of fate."</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">Pope.</span>) <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/18.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>21 Death and life are in the power of the tongue;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And whoever loveth it shall eat its fruit.<p>The hand, &#1497;&#1491;, is so common a metaphor for power, that as here a hand is attributed to the tongue, so e.g., <a href="/isaiah/47-14.htm">Isaiah 47:14</a> to the flame, and <a href="/psalms/49-16.htm">Psalm 49:16</a> to Hades. Death and life is the great alternative which is placed, <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-15.htm">Deuteronomy 30:15</a>, before man. According as he uses his tongue, he falls under the power of death or attains to life. All interpreters attribute, 21b, &#1493;&#1488;&#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1492; to the tongue: qui eam (linguam) amant vescentur (&#1497;&#1488;&#1499;&#1500;, distrib. sing., as <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/3-18.htm">Proverbs 3:18</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/3-35.htm">Proverbs 3:35</a>, etc.) fructu ejus. But "to love the tongue" is a strange and obscure expression. He loves the tongue, says Hitzig, who loves to babble. Euchel: he who guards it carefully, or: he who takes care of it, i.e., who applies himself to right discourse. Combining both, Zckler: who uses it much, as &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; or &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;. The lxx translates, &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788; &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2;, i.e., &#1488;&#1495;&#1494;&#1497;&#1492;; but &#1488;&#1495;&#1494; means prehendere and tenere, not cohibere, and the tongue kept in restraint brings forth indeed no bad fruit, but it brings no fruit at all. Why thus? Does the suffix of &#1493;&#1488;&#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1492;, perhaps like <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/8-17.htm">Proverbs 8:17</a>, Cheth&#305;&#770;b, refer to wisdom, which, it is true, is not named, but which lies everywhere before the poet's mind? At <a href="/proverbs/14-3.htm">Proverbs 14:3</a> we ventured to make &#1495;&#1499;&#1502;&#1492; the subject of 3b. Then 21b would be as a miniature of <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/8-17.htm">Proverbs 8:17-21</a>. Or is &#1493;&#1488;&#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1492; a mutilation of &#1493;&#1488;&#1492;&#1489; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;: and he who loves Jahve (<a href="/psalms/97-10.htm">Psalm 97:10</a>) enjoys its (the tongue's) fruit?</body></html>
