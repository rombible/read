Some understand this of spiritual delight in the Lord; in his ways and ordinances, which wicked men are strangers to: and a very uncomely thing it is for such persons to talk of spiritual joy and delight, and of their communion with God, when they live in sin; <p>much less for a servant to have rule over princes; this was a sight which Solomon had seen, but was very disagreeable to him; and was one of the four things the earth cannot bear; the insolence of a servant, when he becomes master over his superiors, is intolerable; see <a href="/proverbs/30-22.htm">Proverbs 30:22</a>.

Such a life is ruin to a fool. who knows not how to use it properly; it confirms him in his foolish, sinful ways. A man needs religion and reason to enable him to bear prosperity advantageously, and these the fool lacks. "Secundae res," remarks Sallust ('Catil.,' 11), "sapientium animos fatigant," "Even wise men are wearied and harassed by prosperity," much more must such good fortune try those who have no practical wisdom to guide and control their enjoyment. Vatablus explains the clause to mean that it is impossible for a fool, a sinner, to enjoy peace of conscience, which alone is true delight. But looking to the next clause, we see that the moralist is thinking primarily of the elevation of a slave to a high position, and his arrogance in consequence thereof. <span class="cmt_word">Much less for a servant to have rule over princes.</span> By the unwise favouritism of a potentate, a slave of lowly birth might be raised to eminence and set above the nobles and princes of the land. The writer of Ecclesiastes gives his experience in this matter: "I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking as servants upon the earth" (<a href="/ecclesiastes/10-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:7</a>). The same anomaly is mentioned with censure (<a href="/proverbs/30-22.htm">Proverbs 30:22</a> and Ecclus. 11:5). What is the behaviour of unworthy persons thus suddenly raised to high position has formed the subject of many a satire. It is the old story of the "beggar on horseback." A German proverb declares, "Kein Scheermesser scharfer schiest, als wenn der Bauer zu Herrn wird." Claud., 'In Eutrop.,' 181, etc. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Asperius nihil est humili, quum surgit in altum;<br />Cuncta ferit, dum cuncta timet; desaevit in omnes,<br />Ut se posse putent; nec bellua tetrior ulla<br />Quam servi rabies in libera colla furentis."</span> As an example of a different disposition, Cornelius a Lapide refers to the history of Agathocles. Tyrant of Syracuse, who rose from the humble occupation of a potter to a position of vast power, and, to remind himself of his lowly origin, used to dine off mean earthenware. Ausonius thus alludes to this humility ('Epigr.,' 8.) - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Fama est fictilibus coenasse Agathoclea regem,<br />Atque abacum Samio saepe onerasse luto;<br />Fercula gemmatis cum poneret horrida vasis,<br />Et misceret opes pauperiemque simul.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">Quaerenti causam, respondit: Rex ego qui sum<br />Sicaniae, figulo sum genitore satus<br />Fortunam reverenter habe, quicunque repente<br />Dives ab exili progrediere loco."</span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/19.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>4 Wealth bringeth many friends;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; But the reduced - his friend separateth himself.<p>The very same contrast, though otherwise expressed, we had at <a href="/proverbs/14-20.htm">Proverbs 14:20</a>.
