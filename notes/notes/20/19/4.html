Men run into troubles by their own folly, and then fret at the appointments of God. 4. Here we may see how strong is men's love of money. 5. Those that tell lies in discourse, are in a fair way to be guilty of bearing false-witness. 6. We are without excuse if we do not love God with all our hearts. His gifts to us are past number, and all the gifts of men to us are fruits of his bounty. 7. Christ was left by all his disciples; but the Father was with him. It encourages our faith that he had so large an experience of the sorrows of poverty. 8. Those only love their souls aright that get true wisdom. 9. Lying is a damning, destroying sin. 10. A man that has not wisdom and grace, has no right or title to true joy.

The idea of man's selfishness is carried on in vers. 6 and 7. The Law of Moses had tried to counteract it (<a href="/deuteronomy/15-7.htm">Deuteronomy 15:7</a>, etc.), but it was Christianity that introduced the practical realization of the law of love, and the honouring of the poor as members of Christ.

The first &#1502;&#1510;&#1488; is perf. hypotheticum, Gesen. 126, Anm. 1. On the other hand, <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-26.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:26</a>, "I found, &#1502;&#1493;&#1510;&#1488; &#1488;&#1504;&#1497;, more bitter than death the woman," etc.; wherefore, when in Palestine one married a wife, the question was wont to be asked: &#1488;&#1493; &#1502;&#1493;&#1510;&#1488; &#1502;&#1510;&#1488;, has he married happily (after &#1502;&#1510;&#1488; of the book of Proverbs) or unhappily (after &#1502;&#1493;&#1510;&#1488; of Ecclesiastes) (Jebamoth 63b)?<p>(Note: Cf.
