We abuse the doctrine of free grace, if we think that it does away the necessity and advantage of obedience. Those that live at random must die. This truth is clearly taught in words enough to alarm the stoutest sinner. 17. God has chosen the poor of this world, to be rich in faith, and heirs of his kingdom. 18.

There is a "Keri", or marginal reading, which we follow; but the "Cetib", or written text, is, "he shall be killed", or put to death; and so the Syriac version; immediately, by the hand of heaven, by the Lord himself, before his time; or by the judges and civil magistrates; his sins being openly known, as Aben Ezra. <p>(s) "observat". <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/19.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">He that keepeth the commandment keepeth his own soul; but he that despiseth his ways shall die.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/19.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">16</span>. <span class="ital">despiseth</span>] i.e. pays no heed to them (<span class="bld">is careless</span> of, R.V.; negligit, Vulg.), through a contemptuous disregard of “the commandment” which should regulate them.

This insensate carelessness leads to ruin, whether its punishment be undertaken by outraged law. or whether it be left to the Divine retribution. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/19.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>10 Luxury becometh not a fool;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How much less a servant to rule over princes.<p>Thus also with &#1500;&#1488; &#1504;&#1488;&#1493;&#1492; (3 p.

The contrast in the last case is, however, more rugged, and the expression harsher. "A fool cannot bear luxury: he becomes by it yet more foolish; one who was previously a humble slave, but who has attained by good fortune a place of prominence and power, from being something good, becomes at once something bad: an insolent sceleratus" (Fl.). Agur, xxx. 22f., describes such a homo novus as an unbearable calamity; and the author of the Book of Ecclesiastes, written in the time of the Persian domination, speaks, <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:7</a>, of such.
