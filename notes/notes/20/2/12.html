When wisdom has dominion over us, then it not only fills the head, but enters into the heart, and will preserve, both against corruptions within and temptations without. The ways of sin are ways of darkness, uncomfortable and unsafe: what fools are those who leave the plain, pleasant, lightsome paths of uprightness, to walk in such ways! They take pleasure in sin; both in committing it, and in seeing others commit it. Every wise man will shun such company. True wisdom will also preserve from those who lead to fleshly lusts, which defile the body, that living temple, and war against the soul. These are evils which excite the sorrow of every serious mind, and cause every reflecting parent to look upon his children with anxiety, lest they should be entangled in such fatal snares. Let the sufferings of others be our warnings. Our Lord Jesus deters from sinful pleasures, by the everlasting torments which follow them. It is very rare that any who are caught in this snare of the devil, recover themselves; so much is the heart hardened, and the mind blinded, by the deceitfulness of this sin. Many think that this caution, besides the literal sense, is to be understood as a caution against idolatry, and subjecting the soul to the body, by seeking any forbidden object. The righteous must leave the earth as well as the wicked; but the earth is a very different thing to them. To the wicked it is all the heaven they ever shall have; to the righteous it is the place of preparation for heaven. And is it all one to us, whether we share with the wicked in the miseries of their latter end, or share those everlasting joys that shall crown believers?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The evil-doers here include not robbers and murderers only <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/1-10.htm">Proverbs 1:10-16</a>, but all who leave the straight path and the open day for crooked ways, perverse counsels, deeds of darkness.

Who is so by nature and practice, who is hardened in sin and abandoned to it, whose course of life is evil, and who endeavours to draw others into the same evil practices; now the Gospel, and a spiritual knowledge of it, are a means of preserving men from following the examples of such persons, and from walking with them in the ways of sin: or from "the evil way" (t), from every evil way, from a vicious course of life; not from idolatry only, as some interpret it, though this may be included, and chiefly designed; but from all manner of sin, from everything that is contrary to the law of God and sound doctrine; <p>from the man that speaketh froward things; perverse things, things contrary to the light of nature, to divine revelation, to the word of God, both law and Gospel; if a single man is meant, he might be thought to be the man of sin, antichrist, who has a mouth speaking blasphemies against God, his name, his tabernacle, and them that dwell therein, <a href="/revelation/13-5.htm">Revelation 13:5</a>; and the Gospel delivers men from following him, and falling in with his perverse doctrines and practices; but the word seems to be a collective one, and to be understood of all wicked men, to whom the description agrees, as it is explained in the following verses in the plural number; who out of their evil hearts, and the abundance of wickedness there, speak evil things, tending to debauch the minds and manners of others; to be delivered from whom is a singular mercy. Jarchi restrains this to heretics, and such as caused Israel to apostatize to idolatry, and turned the law into evil. The Gospel is undoubtedly a means of preserving from error and heresy. <p>(t)  "a via mala", V. L.

The teacher has already Warned youth against the temptations and dangers of the way of evil men in <a href="/proverbs/1-10.htm">Proverbs 1:10-15</a>; he now shows that discretion, arising from wisdom being resident in the heart, will be a sufficient safeguard against its allurements. <span class="cmt_word">From the man that speaketh froward things.</span> Perverse utterances are here brought in contradistinction to the evil way or froward conduct. <span class="accented">Man</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> <span class="accented">ish</span>) is here used generically, as the representative of the whole class of base and wicked men, since all the following verbs are in the plural, <span class="accented">Froward things.</span> The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d4;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5bb;&#x5db;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5b9;&#x5ea;</span> (<span class="accented">tah'pucoth</span>), here translated "froward things," is derived from the root <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5bc;&#x5e6;&#x5bc;&#x5e6;&#x5bc;</span> (<span class="accented">haphak</span>), "to turn," "to pervert," and should be translated "perverseness." Perverseness is the wilful misrepresentation of that which is good and true. The utterances are of a distorted and tortuous character. The word, only found in the plural, is abstract in form, and is of frequent, though not of exclusive, occurrence in the Proverbs. It is attributed to the Israelites in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-20.htm">Deuteronomy 32:20</a>. It is met with again in such expressions as "the mouth of perverseness," Authorized Version "froward mouth" (<a href="/proverbs/8-13.htm">Proverbs 8:13</a>); "the tongue of perverseness," "froward tongue," Authorized Version (<a href="/proverbs/10-31.htm">Proverbs 10:31</a>); "the man of perverseness," "froward man," Authorized Version (<a href="/proverbs/16-28.htm">Proverbs 16:28</a>). What is here said of wicked men is attributed to drunkards in <a href="/proverbs/23-33.htm">Proverbs 23:33</a>, "Thine heart shall utter perverse things." The expression finds its explanation in <a href="/proverbs/6-13.htm">Proverbs 6:13, 14</a>. The spirit which indulges in this perverseness is stubborn, scornful, self-willed, and rebellious, and it is from such a spirit that discretion is a preservative. In <a href="/job/5-13.htm">Job 5:13</a> it is said that "the counsel of the froward is carried headlong" (see also <a href="/2_samuel/22-27.htm">2 Samuel 22:27</a>; <a href="/psalms/18-26.htm">Psalm 18:26</a>; <a href="/psalms/101-4.htm">Psalm 101:4</a>).

The objection of J. D. Michaelis, Supplem. p. 1167, Non placent in linguis ejusmodi etyma metaphysica, etc., does not apply here, since the word is a new one coined by the Chokma, but all the shades of meaning are naturally derived from the fundamental signification "furtherance" (cf.
