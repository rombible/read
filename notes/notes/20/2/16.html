It would seem as if the evil example of Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/11-1.htm" title="But king Solomon loved many strange women, together with the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Zidonians, and Hittites:">1Kings 11:1</a>), in marrying foreign women, had become common in Israel, and that they, by their vicious lives, had become a deadly source of corruption. Brought up in the lax views of morality which prevailed among heathen nations at this time, they would not consider themselves bound by the high standard of purity which was enjoined upon Hebrew women by the Law.<p>(16-19) Besides the literal sense of this passage, as given above, commentators have very generally found in it a spiritual meaning, a warning against idolatry and apostasy. The union of Israel to God is so frequently spoken of in the prophets under the figure of a marriage, and their rejection of Him for idols as adultery, that the passage may well bear this further sense, especially as Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/3-4.htm" title="Will you not from this time cry to me, My father, you are the guide of my youth?">Jeremiah 3:4</a>) has borrowed this very phrase, “guide of her youth,” for a passage in which he is reproving the Jews for their faithlessness.

When wisdom has dominion over us, then it not only fills the head, but enters into the heart, and will preserve, both against corruptions within and temptations without. The ways of sin are ways of darkness, uncomfortable and unsafe: what fools are those who leave the plain, pleasant, lightsome paths of uprightness, to walk in such ways! They take pleasure in sin; both in committing it, and in seeing others commit it. Every wise man will shun such company. True wisdom will also preserve from those who lead to fleshly lusts, which defile the body, that living temple, and war against the soul. These are evils which excite the sorrow of every serious mind, and cause every reflecting parent to look upon his children with anxiety, lest they should be entangled in such fatal snares. Let the sufferings of others be our warnings. Our Lord Jesus deters from sinful pleasures, by the everlasting torments which follow them. It is very rare that any who are caught in this snare of the devil, recover themselves; so much is the heart hardened, and the mind blinded, by the deceitfulness of this sin. Many think that this caution, besides the literal sense, is to be understood as a caution against idolatry, and subjecting the soul to the body, by seeking any forbidden object. The righteous must leave the earth as well as the wicked; but the earth is a very different thing to them. To the wicked it is all the heaven they ever shall have; to the righteous it is the place of preparation for heaven. And is it all one to us, whether we share with the wicked in the miseries of their latter end, or share those everlasting joys that shall crown believers?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The second great evil, the warnings against which are frequent (see the marginal reference). Two words are used to describe the class.<p>(1) "The strange woman" is one who does not belong to the family, one who by birth is outside the covenant of Israel.<p>(2) "The stranger" is none other than a foreigner.<p>It is the word used of the "strange" wives of Solomon <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/11-1.htm">1 Kings 11:1</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/11-8.htm">1 Kings 11:8</a>, and of those of the Jews who returned from Babylon (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/10.htm">Ezra 10</a>; passim). The two words together, in connection with those which follow, and which imply at once marriage and a profession of religious faith, point to some interesting facts in the social history of Israel. Whatever form the sin here referred to had assumed before the monarchy (and the Book of Judges testifies to its frequency), the contact with Phoenicians and other nations under Solomon had a strong tendency to increase it. The king's example would naturally be followed, and it probably became a fashion to have foreign wives and concubines. At first, it would seem, this was accompanied by some show of proselytism <a href="/proverbs/2-17.htm">Proverbs 2:17</a>; but the old pagan leaven (influence) presently broke out; the sensual worship of other gods led the way to a life of harlotry. The stringent laws of the Mosaic code <a href="/leviticus/19-29.htm">Leviticus 19:29</a>; <a href="/leviticus/21-9.htm">Leviticus 21:9</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/23-18.htm">Deuteronomy 23:18</a> probably deterred the women of Israel from that sin, and led to a higher standard of purity among them than prevailed among other nations.<p>Most interpreters have, however, generalized the words as speaking of any adulteress. The Septuagint as if reluctant to speak of facts so shameful, has allegorized them, and seen in the temptress the personification of "evil counsel." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16-19.

As the Gospel of Christ and its doctrines, or the instructions of wisdom, are a means of delivering persons from the evil man, his company, ways, and works; so from a naughty woman, an adulteress, called a "strange" woman; not because of another nation, or unknown, but because she belongs to another person, and not to him whom she entices into her embraces. Gersom interprets this of the sensitive appetite, and Jarchi of idolatry; as others do also of superstition and all false doctrine, and everything that is contrary to true wisdom; and the whole that is here and afterwards said may well enough be applied to the whore of Rome, from whose fornication, or spiritual adultery, that is, idolatry, will worship, and antichristian doctrines, the Gospel delivers men; see <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/7-5.htm">Proverbs 7:5</a>, &amp;c. <p>even from the stranger which flattereth with her words; that useth smooth and soft words to work upon the passions, move the affections, and win the hearts of men; and ensnare them and draw them to commit wickedness with her; see <a href="/proverbs/5-3.htm">Proverbs 5:3</a>; and so antichrist, and all false teachers and heretics, with good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple, <a href="/romans/16-18.htm">Romans 16:18</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">To deliver thee from the strange <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> woman, <i>even</i> from the stranger <i>which</i> flattereth with her words;</span><p>(i) Meaning, the wisdom which is the word of God, will preserve us from all vices: naming this vice of whoredom to which man is most prone.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">16</span>. <span class="ital">strange woman … stranger</span>] i.e. not belonging to thee; a stranger, in right, to any such relationship. Neither of the words, as here used, has any reference to nationality, as though the danger in question arose chiefly from <span class="ital">foreign</span> women. They are married women of the true religion (<span class="ital"><a href="/proverbs/2-17.htm" title="Which forsakes the guide of her youth, and forgets the covenant of her God.">Proverbs 2:17</a></span>), and wives of fellow-citizens (<a href="/context/proverbs/7-19.htm" title="For the manager is not at home, he is gone a long journey:...">Proverbs 7:19-20</a>) who are here in view. It is a different Heb. word that is used commonly (e.g. <a href="/genesis/15-13.htm" title="And he said to Abram, Know of a surety that your seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;">Genesis 15:13</a>; <a href="/exodus/20-10.htm" title="But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD your God: in it you shall not do any work, you, nor your son, nor your daughter, your manservant, nor your maidservant, nor your cattle, nor your stranger that is within your gates:">Exodus 20:10</a>) for a “stranger” in the sense of a foreigner, one sojourning in a land not his own. The “<span class="ital">strange</span> woman” here is so called in the sense which the same Heb. word bears in such passages as <a href="/exodus/29-33.htm" title="And they shall eat those things with which the atonement was made, to consecrate and to sanctify them: but a stranger shall not eat thereof, because they are holy.">Exodus 29:33</a>; <a href="/exodus/30-33.htm" title="Whoever compounds any like it, or whoever puts any of it on a stranger, shall even be cut off from his people.">Exodus 30:33</a> (one who is outside the family of Aaron); <a href="/deuteronomy/25-5.htm" title="If brothers dwell together, and one of them die, and have no child, the wife of the dead shall not marry without to a stranger: her husband's brother shall go in to her, and take her to him to wife, and perform the duty of an husband's brother to her.">Deuteronomy 25:5</a> (one who is outside the family circle).

Two terms are employed to designate the source of this evil - "the strange woman" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5d4;&#x20;&#x5d6;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, <span class="accented">ishshah zara</span>), and "the stranger" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, <span class="accented">nok'riyah</span>) - and both undoubtedly, in the passage before us, mean a meretricious person, one who indulges in illicit intercourse. The former term is invariably employed in this sense in the Proverbs (<a href="/proverbs/5-2.htm">Proverbs 5:2, 20</a>; <a href="/proverbs/7-5.htm">Proverbs 7:5</a>; <a href="/proverbs/22-14.htm">Proverbs 22:14</a>; <a href="/proverbs/23-33.htm">Proverbs 23:33</a>) of the adulteress (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, <span class="accented">zarim</span>), and <a href="/jeremiah/2-25.htm">Jeremiah 2:25</a>. The participle <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">zar</span>)<span class="accented">, from</span> the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">zur</span>), of which <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">zarah</span>) is the feminine form, is, however, used in a wider sense, as signifying <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> one of another nation, or one of another family; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> or some one different from one's self; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> or strange. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Thus: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> in <a href="/isaiah/1-7.htm">Isaiah 1:7</a> we have "Strangers devour it (your land) in your presence;" but in <a href="/exodus/30-33.htm">Exodus 30:33</a> "the stranger" is one not the high priest. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The "stranger" is another (<a href="/proverbs/11-15.htm">Proverbs 11:15</a>; <a href="/proverbs/14-10.htm">Proverbs 14:10</a>; <a href="/proverbs/20-16.htm">Proverbs 20:16</a>; <a href="/proverbs/27-2.htm">Proverbs 27:2, 13</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The "strange fire" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x20;&#x5d6;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, <span class="accented">esh zarah</span>) <span class="accented">is</span> the unlawful fire as opposed to the holy fire (<a href="/leviticus/10-1.htm">Leviticus 10:1</a>); the "strange god" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x20;&#x5d6;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span>, <span class="accented">el zar</span>) is the foreign god (<a href="/psalms/81-9.htm">Psalm 81:9</a>). But the idea of foreign origin implied in the word is more strongly brought out in the next term, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">nok'riyah</span>), on which Delitzsch remarks that it scarcely ever divests itself of a strange, foreign origin. This word is used to designate those "strange women" whom Solomon loved in his old age, and who turned his heart aside to worship false gods (<a href="/1_kings/11-1.htm">1 Kings 11:1-8</a>), "outlandish women," as they are termed in <a href="/nehemiah/13-26.htm">Nehemiah 13:26</a>; it designates "the strange wives" of <a href="/ezra/10.htm">Ezra 10</a>, and <a href="/nehemiah/13-27.htm">Nehemiah 13:27</a>; and is applied to Ruth the Moabitess (<a href="/ruth/2-10.htm">Ruth 2:10</a>). Again, it has to be further observed that the laws of the Mosaic code against prostitution were of a most stringent nature (<a href="/leviticus/19-29.htm">Leviticus 19:29</a>; <a href="/leviticus/21-9.htm">Leviticus 21:9</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/23-17.htm">Deuteronomy 23:17</a>), and no doubt served to maintain a higher standard of morality among Israelitish women than that observed among the Midianites, Syrians, and other nations. Strong prohibitions were directed against the intermarriage of Israelites with the women of the surrounding nations; but the example set by Solomon would serve to weaken the force of these prohibitions, and would lead to a large influx of women of a different nationality. The conclusion we arrive at is that the class mentioned in the text, though not Israelitish by birth, were yet so by adoption, as the context clearly indicates (ver. 17) the fact of marriage and the acceptance of certain religious observances. Such women, after a temporary restraint, would eventually set all moral and religious obligations at defiance. and would become the source of temptation to others. The allegorical interpretation given to this passage by the LXX. is to be rejected on the ground that the previous section (vers. 12-15) speaks of perverse men. Which <span class="cmt_word">flattereth with her words;</span> literally, <span class="accented">who has made smooth her words</span>, the hiph. perfect being used of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;</span> (<span class="accented">khalak</span>), "to make smooth," or "flattering." The preterite shows what her habitual practice is, and is used of an action still continuing, and so may be fitly rendered by the present, as in the Authorized Version: "She has acquired the art of enticing by flattering words, and it is her study to employ them;" cf. the Vulgate, <span class="accented">quae mollit sermones suos</span>, "who softens her words;" and the Syriac, <span class="accented">quae subvertit verba sua</span>, "who subverts her words," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "uses deceit."

Michaelis rightly interprets all these four conceptions as object-accusatives; the fourth is the summarizing asyndeton (cf. <a href="/psalms/8-7.htm">Psalm 8:7</a>) breaking off the enumeration: omnem denique orbitam boni; Jerome, bonam: in this case, however, &#1496;&#1493;&#1489; would be genitive (vid., <a href="/proverbs/17-2.htm">Proverbs 17:2</a>). &#1502;&#1506;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500; is the way in which the chariot rolls along; in &#1506;&#1490;&#1500; there are united the root-conceptions of that which is found (&#1490;&#1500;) and rolling (&#1490;&#1500;). Whether &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/2-10.htm">Proverbs 2:10</a>, is the argumentative "because" (according to the versions and most interpreters) or "for" ("denn," J. H. Michaelis, Ewald, and others), is a question. That with &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;  equals  "for" the subject would precede the verb, as at <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/2-6.htm">Proverbs 2:6</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/2-21.htm">Proverbs 2:21</a>, and <a href="/proverbs/1-32.htm">Proverbs 1:32</a> (Hitzig), determines nothing, as <a href="/proverbs/2-18.htm">Proverbs 2:18</a> shows. On the one hand, the opinion that &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;  equals  "because" is opposed by the analogy of the &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/2-6.htm">Proverbs 2:6</a>, following &#1488;&#1494;, <a href="/proverbs/2-5.htm">Proverbs 2:5</a>; the inequality between <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/2-5.htm">Proverbs 2:5-8</a> and <a href="/proverbs/2-9.htm">Proverbs 2:9</a>. if the new commencement, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/2-9.htm">Proverbs 2:9</a>, at once gives place to another, <a href="/proverbs/2-10.htm">Proverbs 2:10</a>; the relationship of the subject ideas in <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/2-10.htm">Proverbs 2:10</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/2-11.htm">Proverbs 2:11</a>, which makes <a href="/proverbs/2-11.htm">Proverbs 2:11</a> unsuitable to be a conclusion from <a href="/proverbs/2-10.htm">Proverbs 2:10</a>. On the contrary, the promise not only of intellectual, but at the same time also of practical, insight into the right and the good, according to their whole compass and in their manifoldness, can be established or explained quite well as we thus read <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/2-10.htm">Proverbs 2:10</a>, <a href="/proverbs/2-11.htm">Proverbs 2:11</a> : For wisdom will enter (namely, to make it a dwelling-place, <a href="/proverbs/14-33.htm">Proverbs 14:33</a>; cf. <a href="/john/14-23.htm">John 14:23</a>) into thine heart, and knowledge will do good to thy soul (namely, by the enjoyment which arises from the possession of knowledge, and the rest which its certainty yields). &#1491;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514;, &#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, is elsewhere fem. (<a href="/psalms/139-6.htm">Psalm 139:6</a>), but here, as at <a href="/proverbs/8-10.htm">Proverbs 8:10</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/14-6.htm">Proverbs 14:6</a>, in the sense of &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, is masc. In <a href="/proverbs/2-11.htm">Proverbs 2:11</a> the contents of the &#1488;&#1494; &#1514;&#1489;&#1497;&#1503; (<a href="/proverbs/2-9.htm">Proverbs 2:9</a>) are further explained. &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512; &#1506;&#1500;, of watching (for <a href="/job/16-16.htm">Job 16:16</a> is to be interpreted differently), is used only by our poet (here and at <a href="/proverbs/6-22.htm">Proverbs 6:22</a>). Discretion, i.e., the capacity of well-considered action, will hold watch over thee, take thee under protection; understanding, i.e., the capacity in the case of opposing rules to make the right choice, and in the matter of extremes to choose the right medium, will be bestowed upon thee. In &#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1510;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;, as in <a href="/psalms/61-8.htm">Psalm 61:8</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/140-2.htm">Psalm 140:2</a>, <a href="/psalms/140-5.htm">Psalm 140:5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-9.htm">Deuteronomy 33:9</a>, etc., the first stem letter is not assimilated, in order that the word may have a fuller sound; the writing  &#1499;&#1468;&#1492; for  &#1498; is meant to affect the eye.<p>(Note: For the right succession of the accents here, see Torath Emeth, p. 49,  5; Accentuationssystem, xviii.  3.) </body></html>
