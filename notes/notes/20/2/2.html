The root idea of the original (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;</span> <span class="accented">kashav</span>) is "to sharpen," viz. the ear as expressed, and so to give diligent attention to the precepts of Wisdom. In <a href="/proverbs/1-24.htm">Proverbs 1:24</a> it is rendered "to regard." <span class="cmt_word">To</span> <span class="cmt_word">apply thine heart</span> is to turn the heart with the whole scope of its powers, in the spirit of humility and eagerness, to understanding. As the ear represents the outward vehicle of communication, so the <span class="cmt_word">heart</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;</span>, <span class="accented">lev</span>) represents the inward, the intellectual faculty, the mind, or it may mean the affections as suggested by the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> and Vulgate <span class="accented">cor</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Understanding</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, <span class="accented">t'vunah</span>) is here interchanged with "wisdom," which must determine its meaning to some extent. The LXX. interpreters take it as <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, the faculty of comprehension." Like <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">vinah</span>) in <a href="/proverbs/1-2.htm">Proverbs 1:2</a>, the word describes the faculty of distinguishing or separating: but it does not appear to be here used as representing this "as a faculty of the soul, but as a Divine <span class="accented">power</span> which communicates itself as the gift of God" (Delitzsch). A second and perhaps simpler sense may be given to the sentence. It may mean the turning or applying of the heart in an affectionate and loving way, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> with full purpose, to the discrimination of what is right and what wrong. The ideas of wisdom and understanding seem to some extent to be brought forward as personifications. They are things outside of ourselves, to which we have to give attention. Religion appeals not only to the affections, but also to the intellect, as this satisfies all the yearnings of our nature. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Then - this sublime preacher in the streets continues - distress shall teach them to pray:<p>28 Then shall they call on me, and I will not answer;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They shall early seek after me, and not find me;<p>29 Because that they hated knowledge,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And did not choose the fear of Jahve.<p>30 They have not yielded to my counsel,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despised all my reproof:<p>31 Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their way,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And satiate themselves with their own counsels.<p>In the full emphatic forms, &#1497;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497;, they shall call on me, &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1512;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497;, they shall seek me, and &#1497;&#1502;&#1510;&#1488;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497;, they shall find me, the suffix &#1504;&#1497; may be joined to the old plur. ending u&#770;n (Gesenius, Olshausen, Bttcher); but open forms like &#1497;&#1489;&#1512;&#1499;&#1504;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;, He will bless him,&#1497;&#1499;&#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497;, He will honour me (from &#1497;&#1499;&#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;), and the like, rather favour the conclusion that &#1504; is epenthetic (Ew. 250, b).<p>(Note: In the Codd. &#1497;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497; is written; in this case the Metheg indicates the tone syllable: vid., Torath Emeth, p. 7 note, p. 21 note; and Accentssystem, ii. 1, note.
