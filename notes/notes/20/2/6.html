Natural wisdom in all its branches, with all its improvements, and in its utmost latitude and perfection; and spiritual wisdom, which lies in the knowledge of a man's self, his own folly, impurity, impotence, and misery; being wise unto salvation; in the knowledge of Christ, as the only way of salvation, and of God in Christ; in partaking of the true grace, which is wisdom in the hidden part; in being acquainted experimentally with the doctrines of the Gospel; and in walking wisely and circumspectly, and as becomes it, which is practical wisdom: and all this is the gift of God; as is also Christ, who is wisdom, and is given to be wisdom to his people. He is the gift of God to them, in all characters he bears, and relations he stands in; he is a very large comprehensive gift, an unspeakable one; which is given freely and liberally, and is never taken away again. Now this is said, partly to caution such who search after wisdom, and find it, not to attribute it to their diligence and industry, but to the grace of God; and partly as a direction where to go for it; and as an encouragement to hope to have it, since the Lord freely gives it, <a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>; <p>out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding; by the prophets of the Old Testament who came with a "Thus saith the Lord", and were the mouth of the Lord to the people; from whence flowed the knowledge of divine things; of the will of God; of the Messiah, his person and offices; of his coming, sufferings, death and salvation by him: and by his Son, by whom he has spoke in these last days, and has declared all his mind; and by whom the doctrines of grace and truth, and the knowledge of them, are come fully and clearly, <a href="/hebrews/1-1.htm">Hebrews 1:1</a>; and by the Scriptures of truth, both of the Old and of the New Testament, which are the word of God; what are breathed by him and come out of his mouth, and are able to make men wise unto salvation: and by the ministers of the Gospel, who speak in the name of the Lord, and the Lord by them; and by means of whom he imparts much spiritual and evangelical knowledge to the sons of men; the mouth of a Gospel minister, who is the month of God to men, "speaketh wisdom, and his tongue talketh of judgment", <a href="/psalms/37-30.htm">Psalm 37:30</a>. This clause is added, to encourage to a search after wisdom in the use of means; namely, by attending on the word, and the ministry of it. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For the LORD giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>. <span class="ital">For</span>] Maurer rightly insists that this and two following verses are not a parenthesis, but an integral part of the main argument; q.d.

And I said, I have looked, and behold a candlestick all of gold, with a bowl on the top of it, and his seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes to the seven lamps, which are on the top thereof:">Zechariah 4:2</a>) brings your earnest desire to receive into contact with His readiness to give.

The truth stated here is also met with in <a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>, "He giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding." He "giveth," or more properly, "will give" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span> <span class="accented">yitten</span>, future of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5b7;&#x5df;</span>, <span class="accented">nathan</span>), wisdom; but the connection requires us to understand that the assurance applies only to those who seek after it earnestly and truly (cf. <a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5-7</a>). The two coefficients to our obtaining wisdom are our efforts and God's assistance. Solomon may be adduced as s striking exemplification of this; he asked for "an understanding heart," and God graciously granted his request (see <a href="/1_kings/3-9.htm">1 Kings 3:9, 12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Out of his mouth</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e4;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;</span>, <span class="accented">mippiv</span>); <span class="accented">ex ore ejus</span>; God is here spoken of anthropologically. He is the true Teacher. The meaning is that God communicates wisdom through the medium of his Word (Delitzsch. Pi.). The law proceeds from his mouth (<a href="/job/22-22.htm">Job 22:22</a>). In the Book of Wisdom (7:25), "Wisdom is the breath of the power of God." His word is conveyed to us through men divinely inspired, and hence St. Peter (<a href="/2_peter/1-21.htm">2 Peter 1:21</a>) says that "holy men of old  spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The discourse is now summarily brought to a close:<p>32 For the perverseness of the simple slays them,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the security of fools destroys them.<p>33 But whoever harkeneth to me dwells secure,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And is at rest from fear of evil.<p>Of the two interpretations of &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;, a turning towards (with &#1488;&#1500; and the like, conversion) or a turning away (with &#1502;&#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497; or &#1502;&#1506;&#1500;, desertion), in &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1492; the latter (as in the post-Bib. &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1492;, repentance, the former) is expressed; apostasy from wisdom and from God are conjoined. &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1492; is here carnalis securitas; but the word may also denote the external and the internal peace of the righteous, as &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1504;&#1503;, whence &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1488;&#1504;&#1503;, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/21-23.htm">Job 21:23</a>, as a superlative is formed by the insertion of the &#1500; of &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;, is taken in bonam et malam partem. &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1504;&#1503; is, according to the Masora (also in <a href="/jeremiah/30-10.htm">Jeremiah 30:10</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/46-27.htm">Jeremiah 46:27</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/48-11.htm">Jeremiah 48:11</a>), 3rd perf.

The negative interpretation of &#1502;&#1503;, sine ullo pavore mali (Schultens, Ewald), is unnecessary; also <a href="/job/21-9.htm">Job 21:9</a> may be explained by "peace from terror," especially since &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501; is derived from the root &#1513;&#1500;, extrahere. &#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1491; &#1512;&#1506;&#1492;, "fear of evil," one may perhaps distinguish from &#1508;&#1495;&#1491; &#1512;&#1506; as the genitive of combination. </body></html>
