This earnestness is the counterpart of that which Wisdom herself displays (see <a href="/proverbs/1-20.htm">Proverbs 1:20, 21</a>). <span class="accented">Knowledge</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> insight. In the original there is practically little difference between "knowledge" and "understanding" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>). They carry on the idea expressed in "understanding" in the preceding verse, and thus throw the emphasis on the verbs.

It is that laughter and scorn, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/1-26.htm">Proverbs 1:26</a>, which here sounds forth from the address of the Judge regarding the incorrigible. &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1512; is denom. of &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1512;, to go out and to seek with the morning twilight, as also &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1512;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/27-5.htm">Psalm 27:5</a>, perhaps to appear early, and usually (Arab.) bakar (I, II, IV), to rise early, to be zealous (Lane: "He hastened to do or accomplish, or attain the thing needed"). Zckler, with Hitzig, erroneously regards <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/1-29.htm">Proverbs 1:29</a>, <a href="/proverbs/1-30.htm">Proverbs 1:30</a> as the antecedent to <a href="/proverbs/1-31.htm">Proverbs 1:31</a>.
