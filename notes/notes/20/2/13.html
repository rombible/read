When wisdom has dominion over us, then it not only fills the head, but enters into the heart, and will preserve, both against corruptions within and temptations without. The ways of sin are ways of darkness, uncomfortable and unsafe: what fools are those who leave the plain, pleasant, lightsome paths of uprightness, to walk in such ways! They take pleasure in sin; both in committing it, and in seeing others commit it. Every wise man will shun such company. True wisdom will also preserve from those who lead to fleshly lusts, which defile the body, that living temple, and war against the soul. These are evils which excite the sorrow of every serious mind, and cause every reflecting parent to look upon his children with anxiety, lest they should be entangled in such fatal snares. Let the sufferings of others be our warnings. Our Lord Jesus deters from sinful pleasures, by the everlasting torments which follow them. It is very rare that any who are caught in this snare of the devil, recover themselves; so much is the heart hardened, and the mind blinded, by the deceitfulness of this sin. Many think that this caution, besides the literal sense, is to be understood as a caution against idolatry, and subjecting the soul to the body, by seeking any forbidden object. The righteous must leave the earth as well as the wicked; but the earth is a very different thing to them. To the wicked it is all the heaven they ever shall have; to the righteous it is the place of preparation for heaven. And is it all one to us, whether we share with the wicked in the miseries of their latter end, or share those everlasting joys that shall crown believers?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The evil-doers here include not robbers and murderers only <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/1-10.htm">Proverbs 1:10-16</a>, but all who leave the straight path and the open day for crooked ways, perverse counsels, deeds of darkness.

The strict meaning of the Hebrew word translated "uprightness" is "straightness," and hence it stands opposed to "perverseness" in the previous verse. Uprightness is integrity, rectitude, honest dealing. The LXX. translators represent the forsaking of the paths of uprightness as a consequence resulting from walking in the ways of darkness, "O ye who have left the right ways by departing [<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, equivalent to <span class="accented">abeundo</span>] into the ways of darkness."

They are ways of darkness, because they endeavour to hide themselves from God (<a href="/isaiah/29-15.htm">Isaiah 29:15</a>) and from man (<a href="/job/24-15.htm">Job 24:15</a>; <a href="/job/38-13.htm">Job 38:13, 15</a>). In their tendency and end they lead to the blackness of darkness forever. In Scripture darkness is associated with evil, just as light is with uprightness (see <a href="/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19, 20</a>). The same association of ideas is discoverable in the dualism of the Persian system, as formulated by Zoroaster - Ormuzd, the good principle, presides over the kingdom of light, while Ahriman, the principle of evil, is the ruler of the kingdom of darkness. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Instead of &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1488;&#1501; there is an old &#1488;&#1500; &#1514;&#1511;&#1512;&#1497;<p>(Note: Regarding this formula, see Strack's Prolegomena, pp. 66-70.)<p>(read not so, but thus), &#1499;&#1497; &#1488;&#1501; (if thou callest understanding mother), which supposes the phrase &#1499;&#1497; &#1488;&#1501; (lxx) as traditional.

The objection of J. D. Michaelis, Supplem. p. 1167, Non placent in linguis ejusmodi etyma metaphysica, etc., does not apply here, since the word is a new one coined by the Chokma, but all the shades of meaning are naturally derived from the fundamental signification "furtherance" (cf.
