A foolish man is soon angry, and is hasty in expressing it; he is ever in trouble and running into mischief. It is kindness to ourselves to make light of injuries and affronts, instead of making the worst of them. 17. It is good for all to dread and detest the sin of lying, and to be governed by honesty. 18. Whisperings and evil surmises, like a sword, separate those that have been dear to each other. The tongue of the wise is health, making all whole. 19. If truth be spoken, it will hold good; whoever may be disobliged, still it will keep its ground. 20. Deceit and falsehood bring terrors and perplexities. But those who consult the peace and happiness of others have joy in their own minds. 21. If men are sincerely righteous, the righteous God has engaged that no evil shall happen to them. But they that delight in mischief shall have enough of it. 22. Make conscience of truth, not only in words, but in actions. 23. Foolish men proclaim to all the folly and emptiness of their minds. 24. Those who will not take pains in an honest calling, living by tricks and dishonesty, are paltry and beggarly. 25. Care, fear, and sorrow, upon the spirits, deprive men of vigour in what is to be done, or courage in what is to be borne. A good word from God, applied by faith, makes the heart glad. 26. The righteous is abundant; though not in this world's goods, yet in the graces and comforts of the Spirit, which are the true riches. Evil men vainly flatter themselves that their ways are not wrong. 27. The slothful man makes no good use of the advantages Providence puts in his way, and has no comfort in them. The substance of a diligent man, though not great, does good to him and his family. He sees that God gives it to him in answer to prayer. 28. The way of religion is a straight, plain way; it is the way of righteousness. There is not only life at the end, but life in the way; all true comfort.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The word rendered "roasteth" occurs nowhere else; but the interpretation of the King James Version is widely adopted.

The life of the soul, or spiritual life, as Aben Ezra; and eternal life, as Gersom. One that is in the true way of righteousness is one that is instilled by the righteousness of Christ, which justification is the justification of life: such an one is made alive, and reckons himself alive in a law sense; and enjoys true spiritual peace and comfort, arising from the love and favour of God, and acceptance with him, in which he sees his interest, and in which is life; and this righteousness, by which he is justified before God, entitles him to eternal life; to which the path of holiness, he is directed and enabled to walk in, leads; though it is a narrow way, and a strait gate, <a href="/matthew/7-14.htm">Matthew 7:14</a>. Christ, and righteousness and holiness in and by him, are the way, the truth, and the life, or the true way to eternal life; and all in this way now live spiritually, and shall live eternally, <a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>; <p>and in the pathway thereof there is no death; no condemnation to them that are in Christ, the way, and are justified by his righteousness; the law's sentence of death shall not be executed on them, though it passed upon them in Adam; spiritual death shall not again prevail over those who are passed from death to life; nor shall they be hurt at the second death; they shall never die that death, it shall have no power over them; life and immortality are the sure effects of being in the way of righteousness. The Targum renders it, "the way of the perverse": and the Septuagint version, "of those that remember evil": and the Syriac and Arabic versions, "the way of angry men is unto death": and so the Vulgate Latin version, <p>"the out of the way path leads to death:'' <p>and so some Hebrew copies read, instead of "no death, unto death"; but the most read as we do, and which the Jewish commentators follow. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/12.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">In the way of righteousness is life: and in the pathway thereof there is no death.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/12.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">28</span>. <span class="ital">no death</span>] The rendering <span class="ital">to death</span>, i.e. <span class="ital">the pathway</span> (sc. common and well-trodden, or, of evil men) <span class="bld">leadeth</span> <span class="ital">to death</span>, is supported by LXX. <span class="greekheb">εἰς θάνατον</span>, and Vulg. <span class="ital">ducit ad mortem</span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the way of righteousness is life</span> (comp. <a href="/proverbs/10-2.htm">Proverbs 10:2</a>). For the promise of temporal prosperity which the Jew saw in such passages as these we substitute a better hope. <span class="cmt_word">And in the pathway</span> thereof - of righteousness - <span class="cmt_word">there is no death.</span> Many combine the two words thus: "no death," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> immortality; but examples of such combination are not forthcoming, and the anomaly is not necessitated by the failure of the usual rendering to afford an adequate sense. The Greek and Latin versions are noteworthy. Septuagint, "The ways of the revengeful (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) are unto (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;</span>, not <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>) death." St. Chrysostom refers ('Hom. 16 in Ephesians') to this rendering: "He here speaks of vindictiveness; for on the spur of the moment he allows the sufferer to act in order to cheek the aggressor; but further to bear a grudge he permits not; because the act then is no longer one of passion, nor of boiling rage, but of malice premeditated. Now, God forgives those who may be carried away, perhaps upon a sense of outrage, and rush out to resent it. Hence he says, 'eye for eye;' and yet again 'The ways of the revengeful lead to death." Vulgate, "A devious path leads to death" - a path, that is, which turns aside from the right direction, a life and conversation which are alien from justice and piety. But both the Septuagint and the Vulgate have missed the right meaning of the words in question; <span class="accented">derek nethibah</span>, "pathway." Many see in this verse a plain evidence that the writer believed in the immortality of the soul. We have reason to suppose that such was his faith, but it cannot be proved from this passage, though we may consider that he was guided to speak in terms to which later knowledge would affix a deeper interpretation (see <a href="/proverbs/14-32.htm">Proverbs 14:32</a>, and note there). It is Jesus Christ "who hath brought life and immortality (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>) to light through the gospel" (<a href="/2_timothy/1-10.htm">2 Timothy 1:10</a>). Writers in Solomon's time could speak only darkly about this sublime and comforting hope, though later, as in the Book of Wisdom and throughout most of the Apocryphal books, it formed a common topic, and was used as a reason for patience and resignation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>22 Lying lips are an abhorrence to Jahve,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And they that deal truly are His delight.<p>The frame of the distich is like <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/11-1.htm">Proverbs 11:1</a>, <a href="/proverbs/11-20.htm">Proverbs 11:20</a>. &#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; is probity as the harmony between the words and the inward thoughts.
