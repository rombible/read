Those that stifle their convictions, are like brutes. 2. The man who covers selfish and vicious designs under a profession of religion or friendship, will be condemned. 3. Though men may advance themselves by sinful arts, they cannot settle and secure themselves. But those who by faith are rooted in Christ, are firmly fixed. 4. A wife who is pious, prudent, and looks well to the ways of her household, who makes conscience of her duty, and can bear crosses; such a one is an honour and comfort to her husband. She that is the reverse of this, preys upon him, and consumes him. 5. Thoughts are not free; they are under the Divine knowledge, therefore under the Divine command. It is a man's shame to act with deceit, with trick and design. 6. Wicked people speak mischief to their neighbours. A man may sometimes do a good work with one good word. 7. God's blessing is often continued to the families of godly men, while the wicked are overthrown. 8. The apostles showed wisdom by glorying in shame for the name of Christ. 9. He that lives in a humble state, who has no one to wait upon him, but gets bread by his own labour, is happier than he that glories in high birth or gay attire, and wants necessaries.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Shall deliver them - i. e., The righteous themselves. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. despised&#8212;as opposed to commended (Pr 11:12).<p>perverse heart&#8212;or, "wicked principles," as opposed to one of wisdom.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/proverbs/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">A man shall be commended, </span> to wit, by wise and good men, according to his wisdom; more or less according to the degree of wisdom which his discourses and actions discover to be in him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">He that is of a perverse heart, </span> which he showeth by his wicked words and conversation, shall be despised by God and all wise men. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/proverbs/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>A man shall be commended according to his wisdom,.... Not according to his birth and pedigree; not according to his riches and wealth; not according to the places of honour and trust he may be in; but according to his wisdom, which he discovers in his words and actions, in his life and conversation: not according to the wisdom that is earthly, sensual, and devilish; not according to the wisdom of the world, which comes to nought, either natural or civil; especially that which lies in sophistry and subtlety, in wicked craft and cunning, whereby men trick, overreach, and defraud one another; but according to that which is spiritual and evangelical; which lies in the knowledge of Christ, and of God in Christ, and of those things which belong to salvation; the beginning of which is the fear of the Lord, and which comes from above, and is pure and peaceable. A man possessed of this is commended by all wise and good men, and by the Lord himself; as the wise man is by Christ, <a href="/matthew/7-24.htm">Matthew 7:24</a>; who builds his house on a rock; for which reason it stands, as in the preceding verse; <p>but he that is of a perverse heart shall be despised; and which appears by the perverse words he speaks against God and Christ; against his people, ways, and worship, as antichrist and his followers do; and by his perverse actions, which are contrary to the light of nature, to the law of God, and Gospel of Christ: and such vile persons are contemned in the eyes of all good men, and are had in abhorrence by the Lord himself; for such who despise him are lightly esteemed; see <a href="/proverbs/18-3.htm">Proverbs 18:3</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/12.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">A man shall be commended according to his wisdom: but he that is of a perverse heart shall be despised.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">According to his wisdom.</span> A man who gives practical proof of wisdom by life and character, whose words and actions show that he is actuated by high views, is praised and acknowledged by all (see on Proverbs 27:21). Thus we read of David, that he behaved himself wisely, "and he was acceptable in the sight of all the people" (<a href="/1_samuel/18-5.htm">1 Samuel 18:5</a>). The Septuagint, taking <span class="accented">lephi</span> differently, renders, "The mouth of the prudent is commended by men." <span class="cmt_word">He that is of a perverse heart;</span> Vulgate, "a vain and senseless man;" Septuagint, "one slow of heart (<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>)."

The meaning of the subject-conception &#1496;&#1493;&#1489; is defined according to this, although in itself also it is clear, for &#1496;&#1493;&#1489;, used of God (e.g., <a href="/psalms/73-1.htm">Psalm 73:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/86-5.htm">Psalm 86:5</a>) and of men (<a href="/proverbs/13-22.htm">Proverbs 13:22</a>; <a href="/proverbs/14-14.htm">Proverbs 14:14</a>), denotes the good (bonus) in the sense of the benevolent (benignus); the Scripture truths, that God is love, that love is the essence of goodness and is the fulfilling of the law, are so conformed to reason, that they stamp themselves as immediate component parts of the human consciousness. A &#1496;&#1493;&#1489; is thus a man who acts according to the ruling motive of self-sacrificing love; such an one obtains (vid., on &#1497;&#1508;&#1497;&#1511;, educit  equals  adipiscitur, at <a href="/proverbs/3-13.htm">Proverbs 3:13</a>) the favour of God, He is and shows Himself kind to him, while on the contrary He condemns the wicked intriguer. Hitzig translates: the former of intrigues is punishable (as the Syr.: is condemned; Targ.: his contrivance is shattered to pieces); but to become a &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;  equals  reus &#1492;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1506; does not denote, but either to practise &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/34-12.htm">Job 34:12</a>, or to set forth as &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;  equals  to condemn, <a href="/isaiah/50-9.htm">Isaiah 50:9</a>. Taken in the former signification (Jerome, impie agit), a declaration is made which is not needed, since the moral badness already lies in the reference of the subject: thus &#1497;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1506; will be used also of Jahve. In proof that the poet did not need to say &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, Zckler rightly points to <a href="/proverbs/10-6.htm">Proverbs 10:6</a>; <a href="/job/22-29.htm">Job 22:29</a>. </body></html>
