A foolish man is soon angry, and is hasty in expressing it; he is ever in trouble and running into mischief. It is kindness to ourselves to make light of injuries and affronts, instead of making the worst of them. 17. It is good for all to dread and detest the sin of lying, and to be governed by honesty. 18. Whisperings and evil surmises, like a sword, separate those that have been dear to each other. The tongue of the wise is health, making all whole. 19. If truth be spoken, it will hold good; whoever may be disobliged, still it will keep its ground. 20. Deceit and falsehood bring terrors and perplexities. But those who consult the peace and happiness of others have joy in their own minds. 21. If men are sincerely righteous, the righteous God has engaged that no evil shall happen to them. But they that delight in mischief shall have enough of it. 22. Make conscience of truth, not only in words, but in actions. 23. Foolish men proclaim to all the folly and emptiness of their minds. 24. Those who will not take pains in an honest calling, living by tricks and dishonesty, are paltry and beggarly. 25. Care, fear, and sorrow, upon the spirits, deprive men of vigour in what is to be done, or courage in what is to be borne. A good word from God, applied by faith, makes the heart glad. 26. The righteous is abundant; though not in this world's goods, yet in the graces and comforts of the Spirit, which are the true riches. Evil men vainly flatter themselves that their ways are not wrong. 27. The slothful man makes no good use of the advantages Providence puts in his way, and has no comfort in them. The substance of a diligent man, though not great, does good to him and his family. He sees that God gives it to him in answer to prayer. 28. The way of religion is a straight, plain way; it is the way of righteousness. There is not only life at the end, but life in the way; all true comfort.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The word rendered "roasteth" occurs nowhere else; but the interpretation of the King James Version is widely adopted.

Because he takes none. The slothful man takes no pains to get anything for a livelihood, by hunting or otherwise; and though he loves to live well, and eat roast meat, yet what he roasts is not what he has got himself, but what another has laboured for. It is observed (o) that fowlers burn the wings of birds taken by them, that they may not fly away; to which the allusion may be. Or, "the deceitful" (p) man, as it may be rendered; though he may get much in a fraudulent way, yet it does not prosper with him, he does not enjoy it; it is taken away from him before he can partake of it, or receive any comfort from it, or advantage by it; just as a man that has took anything in hunting, he cannot keep it; it is taken away from him, perhaps by a dog or some man, before he can roast it, and make it fit for eating. Ben Melech, from Joseph Kimchi, observes, that fowlers, when they catch fowls, burn the top of their wings, that they may not fly away at once; and they do not cut their wings off, that they may be left, and appear beautiful to them that buy them: but the slothful or deceitful man does not let the fowl remain in his hands till he burns it; for before that it flies out of his hands, and it is lost to him; which is figuratively to be understood of riches and wealth, gathered by violence and deceit, and lost suddenly. What is ill gotten does not spend well; it does not last long, it is presently gone; there is no true enjoyment of it. Or he will not shut it up within lattices (q) and reserve it, but spend it directly; see Sol 2:9; <p>but the substance of a diligent man is precious; what is gotten by industry and diligence, and in an honest way, is valuable; it comes with a blessing; there is comfort in the enjoyment of it, and it continues. Some render it, "the substance of a precious man is gold" (r); so the Targum, <p>"the substance of a man is precious gold;'' <p>and to the same purpose the Vulgate Latin version: a diligent man grows rich; and what he gets spends well, and his substance is daily increasing. <p>(o) Vid.

It seems to be a proverbial saying, implying either that a lazy man will not take the trouble to hunt, or, if he does hunt, will not prepare the food which he has taken in the chase, or that he does not enjoy it when he has gotten it. Others render, "will not start his prey;" or "catch his prey," Septuagint; or "secure his prey," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> will not keep in his net what he has caught, but carelessly lets it escape. The Vulgate renders, "The cheat will gain no profit." The word rendered "cheat," <span class="accented">fraudulentus</span> in the Latin, and <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> in the Greek, is the same as that rightly translated "slothful" (ver. 24). <span class="cmt_word">But the substance of a diligent man is precious;</span> <span class="accented">i.e. </span>the substance which an honest, industrious man acquires by his labour is stable and of real value. This second clause, however, is variously translated, Revised Version, <span class="accented">But the</span> <span class="accented">precious substance of men is to the diligent</span>, or, <span class="accented">is to be diligent</span>; Delitzsch, "Diligence is a man's precious possession;" Septuagint, "A pure man is a precious possession." The Authorized Version is probably erroneous, and the rendering should be, as Delitzsch and Nowack take it, "But a precious possession of a man is diligence." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>21 No evil befalls the righteous,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the godless are full of evil.<p>Hitzig translates &#1488;&#1493;&#1503; "sorrow," and Zckler "injury;" but the word signifies evil as ethical wickedness, and although it may be used of any misfortune in general (as in &#1489;&#1468;&#1503;&#1470;&#1488;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;, opp. &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1503;); thus it denotes especially such sorrow as is the harvest and product of sin, <a href="/proverbs/22-8.htm">Proverbs 22:8</a>; <a href="/job/4-8.htm">Job 4:8</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/59-4.htm">Isaiah 59:4</a>, or such as brings after it punishment, <a href="/habakkuk/3-7.htm">Habakkuk 3:7</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/4-15.htm">Jeremiah 4:15</a>. That it is also here thus meant the contrast makes evident. The godless are full of evil, for the moral evil which is their life-element brings out of itself all kinds of evil; on the contrary, no kind of evil, such as sin brings forth and produces, falls upon the righteous. God, as giving form to human fortune (<a href="/exodus/21-13.htm">Exodus 21:13</a>), remains in the background (cf. <a href="/psalms/91-10.htm">Psalm 91:10</a> with <a href="/psalms/5-1.htm">Psalm 5:1</a>.); vid., regarding &#1488;&#1504;&#1492;, the weaker power of &#1506;&#1504;&#1492;, to go against, to meet, to march against, Fleischer, Levy's Chald.
