A foolish man is soon angry, and is hasty in expressing it; he is ever in trouble and running into mischief. It is kindness to ourselves to make light of injuries and affronts, instead of making the worst of them. 17. It is good for all to dread and detest the sin of lying, and to be governed by honesty. 18. Whisperings and evil surmises, like a sword, separate those that have been dear to each other. The tongue of the wise is health, making all whole. 19. If truth be spoken, it will hold good; whoever may be disobliged, still it will keep its ground. 20. Deceit and falsehood bring terrors and perplexities. But those who consult the peace and happiness of others have joy in their own minds. 21. If men are sincerely righteous, the righteous God has engaged that no evil shall happen to them. But they that delight in mischief shall have enough of it. 22. Make conscience of truth, not only in words, but in actions. 23. Foolish men proclaim to all the folly and emptiness of their minds. 24. Those who will not take pains in an honest calling, living by tricks and dishonesty, are paltry and beggarly. 25. Care, fear, and sorrow, upon the spirits, deprive men of vigour in what is to be done, or courage in what is to be borne. A good word from God, applied by faith, makes the heart glad. 26. The righteous is abundant; though not in this world's goods, yet in the graces and comforts of the Spirit, which are the true riches. Evil men vainly flatter themselves that their ways are not wrong. 27. The slothful man makes no good use of the advantages Providence puts in his way, and has no comfort in them. The substance of a diligent man, though not great, does good to him and his family. He sees that God gives it to him in answer to prayer. 28. The way of religion is a straight, plain way; it is the way of righteousness. There is not only life at the end, but life in the way; all true comfort.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The thought which lies below the surface is that of the inseparable union between truth and justice.

The man that speaks truth is and will be established in his credit and reputation among men; he is uniform and all of a piece, and what he says is believed; truth, though it may be opposed, will prevail against lies and falsehood; the word of truth, the Gospel of Christ, will stand for ever; the ministers of truth and righteousness will be continued to the end of the world; Christ, who is truth itself, abides the same to day, yesterday, and for ever; <p>but a lying tongue is but for a moment; if a liar speaks truth for once, he does not continue in it long, but quickly returns to his former course; or rather the lie he tells is very short lived, it is soon discovered, and he comes into contempt and disgrace, and loses all his credit and reputation among men of honour and honesty, and is sometimes suddenly snatched away by death, as Ananias and Sapphira; all error and heresy in a short time will cease and be no more; and antichrist, whose coming is with lying wonders, the direct opposite of the lip of truth, will be brought to ruin in a moment. Aben Ezra, Kimchi, and Ben Melech, who are followed by some Christian interpreters, as Montanus, and some in Vatablus, render it, "but", or "for ever, I will cause the lying tongue to cease", or "be at rest" from speaking; as if they were the words of God, threatening to cut off the lying tongue; but Jarchi and Gersom render it "for a moment", or a very short time, as we and others do; or, "whilst one winks" (f), in the twinkling of an eye; so soon is such a person removed. <p>(f)  "at dum nictem", Schultens. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/12.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The lip of truth shall be established for ever: but a lying tongue is but for a moment.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/12.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">19</span>. <span class="ital">but for a moment</span>] Lit. <span class="ital">while I wink</span>.

The translation: but the righteous ... restores &#1493;&#1497;&#1510;&#1488; (&#1493;&#1497;&#1510;&#1488;), and ignores the syllogistic relation of the members of the proverb, which shows itself here (cf. the contrary, <a href="/proverbs/11-9.htm">Proverbs 11:9</a>) to a certain degree by &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1510;&#1488;. Ewald displaces this relation, for he paraphrases: "any one may easily come into great danger by means of inconsiderate words; yet it is to be hoped that the righteous may escape, for he will guard himself against evil from the beginning." He is right here in interpreting &#1510;&#1512;&#1492; and &#1502;&#1493;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473; &#1512;&#1506; as the designation of danger into which one is betrayed by the transgressions of his lips, but "inconsiderate words" are less than &#1508;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; &#1513;&#1474;&#1508;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501;. One must not be misled into connecting with &#1508;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; the idea of missing, or a false step, from the circumstance that &#1508;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; means a step; both verbs have, it is true, the common R. &#1508;&#1513; with the fundamental idea of placing apart or separating, but &#1508;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; has nothing to do with &#1508;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; (step  equals  placing apart of the legs), but denotes (as Arab. fusuwk&#803; fisk&#803;, from the primary meaning diruptio, diremtio) a sinning, breaking through and breaking off the relation to God (cf. e.g., <a href="/proverbs/28-24.htm">Proverbs 28:24</a>), or even the restraints of morality (<a href="/proverbs/10-19.htm">Proverbs 10:19</a>). Such a sinning, which fastens itself to, and runs even among the righteous, would not be called &#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;, but rather &#1495;&#1496;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514; (<a href="/proverbs/20-9.htm">Proverbs 20:9</a>). According to this the proverb will mean that sinful words bring into extreme danger every one who indulges in them - a danger which he can with difficulty escape; and that thus the righteous, who guards himself against sinful words, escapes from the distress (cf. with the expression, <a href="/ecclesiastes/7-18.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:18</a>) into which one is thereby betrayed. &#1512;&#1506; is the descriptive and expressive epithet to &#1502;&#1493;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473; (cf. <a href="/ecclesiastes/9-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:12</a>): a bad false trap, a malicious snare, for &#1502;&#1493;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473; is the snare which closes together and catches the bird by the feet. This proverb is repeated at <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/29-6.htm">Proverbs 29:6</a>, peculiarly remodelled. The lxx has after <a href="/proverbs/12-13.htm">Proverbs 12:13</a> another distich:<p>He who is of mild countenance findeth mercy;<p>He who is litigious oppresseth souls.<p>(&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1514;, or rather, more in accordance with the Hebrew original: oppresseth himself, &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;.) </body></html>
