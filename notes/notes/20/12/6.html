Those that stifle their convictions, are like brutes. 2. The man who covers selfish and vicious designs under a profession of religion or friendship, will be condemned. 3. Though men may advance themselves by sinful arts, they cannot settle and secure themselves. But those who by faith are rooted in Christ, are firmly fixed. 4. A wife who is pious, prudent, and looks well to the ways of her household, who makes conscience of her duty, and can bear crosses; such a one is an honour and comfort to her husband. She that is the reverse of this, preys upon him, and consumes him. 5. Thoughts are not free; they are under the Divine knowledge, therefore under the Divine command. It is a man's shame to act with deceit, with trick and design. 6. Wicked people speak mischief to their neighbours. A man may sometimes do a good work with one good word. 7. God's blessing is often continued to the families of godly men, while the wicked are overthrown. 8. The apostles showed wisdom by glorying in shame for the name of Christ. 9. He that lives in a humble state, who has no one to wait upon him, but gets bread by his own labour, is happier than he that glories in high birth or gay attire, and wants necessaries.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Shall deliver them - i. e., The righteous themselves. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6.

Hebr. in the way of becoming a conditional particle; it opens, as here, the antecedent of a gradatio a minori ad majus introduced by &#1488;&#1507; &#1499;&#1497;, <a href="/job/15-15.htm">Job 15:15</a>., <a href="/proverbs/25-5.htm">Proverbs 25:5</a>., cf. &#1492;&#1503; (&#1492;&#1504;&#1492;) with &#1493;&#1488;&#1497;&#1498; following, <a href="/genesis/44-8.htm">Genesis 44:8</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/12-18.htm">2 Samuel 12:18</a>. <a href="/2_samuel/13-13.htm">2 Samuel 13:13</a> presents itself as the nearest parallel to &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1501;, where it means, to be rewarded. It is a vocabulum anceps, and denotes full requital, i.e., according to the reference, either righteous reward or righteous punishment. If 30a is understood of reward, and 30b of punishment, then the force of the argument in the conclusion consists in this, that the righteous can put forth no claim to a recompense, because his well-doing is never so perfect as not to be mingled with sin (<a href="/ecclesiastes/7-20.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:20</a>; <a href="/psalms/143-2.htm">Psalm 143:2</a>); while, on the contrary, the repression of the wicked, who, as &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; as to his intention, and &#1495;&#1493;&#1496;&#1488; as to his conduct, actually denies his dependence on God, is demanded by divine holiness. But the conclusion is not stringent, since in the relation of God to the righteous His dispensation of grace and faithfulness to promises also come into view, and thus in both cases &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1501; appears to require the same interpretation: if the righteous does not remain unrevenged, so much more shall not the godless and the sinner remain..., or how much less shall the godless and the sinner remain so. Thus the Graec. Venet., &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#837; &#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#834;&#837; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;; thus also Luther, and among the moderns Lwenstein and Elster.
