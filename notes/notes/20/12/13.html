A godly man would not put even an animal to needless pain. But the wicked often speak of others as well used, when they would not endure like treatment for a single day. 11. It is men's wisdom to mind their business, and follow an honest calling. But it is folly to neglect business; and the grace of God teaches men to disdain nothing but sin. 12. When the ungodly see others prosper by sin, they wish they could act in the same way. But the root of Divine grace, in the heart of the righteous, produces other desires and purposes. 13.

This they run into with such a blind infatuation, that it seems as if they were in love with their own destruction. The marginal rendering gives the thought that the wicked seek the protection of others like themselves, but seek in vain; the "root of the just" (i. e., that in them which is fixed and stable) alone yields that protection. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13, 14.

A wicked man often brings himself into trouble by giving his tongue too great a liberty, and by making free with the characters of others; sometimes by treasonable speeches against his sovereign; sometimes by bearing false Witness, and by lies and perjuries, of which he is convicted in open court; and by calumnies, reproaches, detraction, and scandal raised by him, and cast on his neighbour, who sues him for these things: or "in the transgression of the lips is an evil snare"; or "the snare of an evil man" (y); by the wicked things they say they lay a snare for others, which the simple and incautious are taken in; so heretics ensnare men by their good words and fair speeches, and plausibility of their doctrines; so antichrist, by lies in hypocrisy, and by his deceivableness of unrighteousness; <p>but the just shall come out of trouble; or escape it; he escapes the snare that is laid for him, and so the trouble consequent upon it; a just man escapes trouble by not giving his tongue the liberty wicked men do; and when he by any means falls into trouble, he gets out of it again by giving good words to those in whose hands he is; and by his prayers and supplications unto God. The righteous are sometimes in trouble, and in such sort of trouble as others are not; by reason of their own corruptions, Satan's temptations, the hidings of God's face, as well as various outward afflictions; out of all which the Lord delivers them sooner or later, in life or in death, <a href="/psalms/34-19.htm">Psalm 34:19</a>. Jarchi exemplifies this in the case of righteous Noah, who escaped the flood, when the world of the ungodly were destroyed by it, for the transgression of their lips, saying, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/21-15.htm">Job 21:15</a>, "what is the Almighty?" &amp;c. <p>(y)    "in praevaricatione labiorum laqueos malus", Montanus, Michaelis, Schultens, so Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator, Cocceius; "vel laqueus hominis mali", Mercerus, Gejerus. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/12.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The wicked is snared by the transgression of his lips: but the just shall come out of trouble.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/12.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">13</span>. <span class="ital">The wicked is snared</span>] Rather:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In the transgression of the lips is a snare to the evil man</span>,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>R.V. text; comp. A.V. marg., and for the sentiment, <a href="/proverbs/18-7.htm" title="A fool's mouth is his destruction, and his lips are the snare of his soul.">Proverbs 18:7</a>. This is preferable to the rendering of R.V. marg., <span class="ital">an evil snare</span>, because it preserves the balance of the verse: the evil man, by the wicked and deceitful words which he uses to prosecute his purposes, entangles himself in a snare: the righteous man, by his righteous dealing, though he fall into trouble, is delivered out of it and walks at liberty.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The LXX. add:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“He that hath regard to gentleness shall obtain mercy;<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But he that opposeth men in the gates will trouble souls.”<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The wicked is snared by the transgression of his lips;</span> rather, <span class="accented">in the transgression of the lips is an evil snare</span> (<a href="/proverbs/18-7.htm">Proverbs 18:7</a>). A man by speaking unadvisedly or intemperately brings trouble upon himself, involves himself in difficulties which he did not foresee. Often when he has spoken in order to injure others, the slander or the censure has redounded on himself (comp. <a href="/psalms/7-15.htm">Psalm 7:15, 16</a>; <a href="/psalms/9-16.htm">Psalm 9:16</a>). The just; the man who does not offend with his lips, avoids these snares. The Septuagint here introduces a couplet not found in the Hebrew: "He who looketh gently (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span>) shall obtain mercy; but he who frequents the gates [or, 'contends in the gates,' <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>] will harass souls." This seems to mean the man who is calm and considerate for others will himself be treated with pity and consideration (<a href="/matthew/5-7.htm">Matthew 5:7</a>); but he who is a gossip, or a busybody, or litigious, will be always vexing his neighbours. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>7 The godless are overturned and are no more,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; But the house of the righteous stands.<p>Bertheau and Zckler explain: The wicked turn about, then are they no more; i.e., as we say: it is over with them "in the turning of a hand." The noun in the inf. absol. may certainly be the subject, like <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/17-12.htm">Proverbs 17:12</a>, as well as the object (Ewald, 328c), and &#1492;&#1508;&#1498; may be used of the turning about of oneself, <a href="/psalms/78-9.htm">Psalm 78:9</a>; <a href="/2_kings/5-26.htm">2 Kings 5:26</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/9-12.htm">2 Chronicles 9:12</a>. That explanation also may claim for itself that &#1492;&#1508;&#1498; nowhere occurs with a personal object, if we except one questionable passage, <a href="/isaiah/1-7.htm">Isaiah 1:7</a>. But here the interpretation of the &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; as the object lies near the contrast of &#1489;&#1497;&#1514;, and moreover the interpretation of the &#1492;&#1508;&#1498;, not in the sense of &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; (lxx), but of &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; (Syr., Targ., Jerome, Graec. Venet., Luther), lies near the contrast of &#1497;&#1506;&#1502;&#1491;. The inf. absol. thus leaves the power from which the catastrophe proceeds indefinite, as the pass. &#1497;&#1492;&#1508;&#1508;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468; would also leave it, and the act designedly presented in a vague manner to connect with &#1493; the certain consequences therewith, as <a href="/proverbs/25-4.htm">Proverbs 25:4</a>., as if to say: there comes only from some quarter an unparalleled overthrow which overwhelms the godless; thus no rising up again is to be thought on, it is all over with them; while, on the contrary, the house of the righteous withstands the storm which sweeps away the godless. </body></html>
