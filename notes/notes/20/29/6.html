The word of God warns all to flee from the wrath to come, to the hope set before us in Jesus Christ. 2. The people have cause to rejoice or mourn, as their rulers are righteous or wicked. 3. Divine wisdom best keeps us from ruinous lusts. 4. The Lord Jesus is the King who will minister true judgment to the people. 5. Flatterers put men off their guard, which betrays them into foolish conduct. 6. Transgressions always end in vexations. Righteous men walk at liberty, and walk in safety. 7. This verse is applicable to compassion for the distress of the poor, and the unfeeling disregard shown by the wicked. 8. The scornful mock at things sacred and serious. Men who promote religion, which is true wisdom, turn away the wrath of God. 9. If a wise man dispute with a conceited wrangler, he will be treated with anger or ridicule; and no good is done. 10. Christ told his disciples that they should be hated of all men.

Or, according to the accents in some copies, "in the transgression of a man is an evil snare", as Aben Ezra observes the words may be read; there is a snare in sin to man himself; one sin leads on to another, and a man is snared by the works of his own hands, and is implicated and held in the cords of his own iniquity, and falls into the snare of the devil, out of which he is not easily recovered; and the transgression of one man is a snare to another; he is drawn into sin by ill examples; and, by indulging himself in sin, the evil day comes upon him unawares as a snare; and sooner or later he is filled with horrors of conscience, anguish, and distress; <p>but the righteous doth sing and rejoice; not at the snares of others, their sin or punishment; for such a man rejoices not in iniquity, though he sometimes does at the punishment of sinners, because of the glory of the divine justice; and Gersom thinks this is here meant; see <a href="/psalms/58-10.htm">Psalm 58:10</a>; but rather, as he also observes, the righteous man rejoices at his deliverance from the snares of sin and Satan, and of the world; he rejoices in the righteousness by which he is denominated righteous; not his own, but the righteousness of Christ, it being so rich and glorious, so perfect and complete; he rejoices in salvation by him it being so suitable, so, real, so full, so free, and so much for the glory of God; he rejoices in the pardon of his sins through the blood of Christ, and in the expiation of them by his sacrifice; he rejoices in his person, in the greatness, fitness, fulness, and beauty of it; he rejoices in all his offices he bears and executes, and in all the relations he stands in to him; he rejoices in his word and ordinances, in the prosperity of his cause and interest, in the good of his people, and in hope of the glory of God; and even sings for joy in the view of electing, redeeming, and calling grace, and eternal life and happiness; he has peace of conscience now, fears no enemy, nor any danger, and expects a life of glory in the world to come; and oftentimes sings on the brink of the grave, in the view of death and eternity. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/29.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">In the transgression of an evil man <i>there is</i> a <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> snare: but the righteous doth sing and rejoice.</span><p>(b) He is always ready to fall into the snare that he lays for others.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/29.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>. <span class="ital">a snare</span>] in which, though perhaps he laid it for others (<a href="/context/psalms/9-15.htm" title="The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made: in the net which they hid is their own foot taken....">Psalm 9:15-16</a>), he himself shall be taken, and so have sorrow, in contrast to the “joy and singing” of the righteous.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the transgression of an evil man there is a snare</span> (<a href="/proverbs/12-13.htm">Proverbs 12:13</a>). The snare is that the sinner is caught and held fast by his sin, and cannot escape, as he knows nothing of repentance, and has no will to cast off evil habits (<a href="/proverbs/24-16.htm">Proverbs 24:16</a>). (For "snare," comp. <a href="/proverbs/18-7.htm">Proverbs 18:7</a>; <a href="/proverbs/20-25.htm">Proverbs 20:25</a>; <a href="/proverbs/22-25.htm">Proverbs 22:25</a>.) Septuagint, "For a man sinning there lies a great snare." <span class="cmt_word">But the righteous doth sing and rejoice.</span> The antithesis is not very obvious. It may mean that the good man has a conscience at peace, is free from the snare of sin, and therefore is glad; or that, in spite of a momentary fall, though he has transgressed, he knows that God forgives him on his repentance, and this makes him happy; or, generally that he rejoices in the happy life which his virtue procures for him here and hereafter (<a href="/matthew/5-12.htm">Matthew 5:12</a>). In the original "sing" represents the sudden outburst of joy, "rejoice" the continued state of happiness.
