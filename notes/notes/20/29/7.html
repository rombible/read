The word of God warns all to flee from the wrath to come, to the hope set before us in Jesus Christ. 2. The people have cause to rejoice or mourn, as their rulers are righteous or wicked. 3. Divine wisdom best keeps us from ruinous lusts. 4. The Lord Jesus is the King who will minister true judgment to the people. 5. Flatterers put men off their guard, which betrays them into foolish conduct. 6. Transgressions always end in vexations. Righteous men walk at liberty, and walk in safety. 7. This verse is applicable to compassion for the distress of the poor, and the unfeeling disregard shown by the wicked. 8. The scornful mock at things sacred and serious. Men who promote religion, which is true wisdom, turn away the wrath of God. 9. If a wise man dispute with a conceited wrangler, he will be treated with anger or ridicule; and no good is done. 10. Christ told his disciples that they should be hated of all men.

This is to be understood chiefly of a civil magistrate, a judge righteous; who will take notice of and regard a poor man's cause, and take a good deal of pains and care that he is not injured. Or, "knoweth the judgment of the poor" (m) he acquaints himself with his case, makes himself thoroughly master of it, searches out his cause as Job did, <a href="/proverbs/29-16.htm">Proverbs 29:16</a>; <p>but the wicked regardeth not to know it; or, "does not understand knowledge" (n) of the poor man's cause and case; and there being no money to be had, he does not care to consider it, and look into it, and get knowledge of it, and do him justice; he will not take his cause in hand, or plead it. <p>(m)    "novit justus causan pauperum", V.

Septuagint, "A righteous man knows how to judge for the poor." <span class="cmt_word">The wicked regardeth not to know it.</span> This is a clumsy translation; it means, pays no attention so as to become fully acquainted with its details and bearings. But the words signify rather, as in the Revised Version margin, "understandeth not knowledge" (<a href="/proverbs/19-25.htm">Proverbs 19:25</a>; <a href="/proverbs/28-5.htm">Proverbs 28:5</a>), has no knowledge which would lead him to enter into the poor man's case, and to sympathize with him in his distress; the claims of the feeble to recognition and relief at his hands are utterly unknown and disregarded. He can daily look on Lazarus at his gate, and find no call for his pity and charity; he can see the wounded traveller in the road, and pass by on the other side. The LXX. offers two translations of the latter clause, reading the second time <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5e2;</span>, and thereby not improving the sense: "But the ungodly understand. eth not knowledge, and the poor man hath not an understanding mind." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/29.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>A general ethical proverb here follows:<p>A man often corrected who hardeneth his neck,<p>Shall suddenly go to ruin without remedy.<p>Line second  equals  <a href="/proverbs/6-15.htm">Proverbs 6:15</a>. The connection &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1499;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; must make the nearest impression on a reader of the Book of Proverbs that they mean a censurer (reprehender), but which is set aside by what follows, for the genit. after &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; is, <a href="/proverbs/16-29.htm">Proverbs 16:29</a>; <a href="/proverbs/26-21.htm">Proverbs 26:21</a>; <a href="/proverbs/29-10.htm">Proverbs 29:10</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/13-20.htm">Proverbs 13:20</a>, the designation of that which proceeds from the subject treated. And since &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1499;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514;, <a href="/psalms/37-15.htm">Psalm 37:15</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/23-4.htm">Job 23:4</a>, denotes counter evidence, and generally rejoinders, thus in the first line a reasoner is designated who lets nothing be said to him, and nothing be shown to him, but contradicts all and every one. Thus e.g., Fleischer: vir qui correptus contradicit et cervicem obdurat. But this interpolated correptus gives involuntary testimony of this, that the nearest lying impression of the '&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1514;&#1493; suffers a change by &#1502;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; &#1506;&#1512;&#1507;: if we read &#1492;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; (&#1500;&#1489;) &#1506;&#1512;&#1507; with '&#1514;&#1493;, the latter then designates the correptio, over against which is placed obstinate boldness (Syr., Targ., Jerome, Luther), and '&#1514;&#1493; shows itself thus to be gen. objecti, and we have to compare the gen. connection of &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, as at <a href="/proverbs/18-23.htm">Proverbs 18:23</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/21-17.htm">Proverbs 21:17</a>, or rather at <a href="/1_kings/20-42.htm">1 Kings 20:42</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/15-10.htm">Jeremiah 15:10</a>. But it is unnecessary, with Hitzig, to limit '&#1514;&#1493; to divine infliction of punishment, and after <a href="/hosea/5-9.htm">Hosea 5:9</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/37-3.htm">Isaiah 37:3</a>, to read &#1514;&#1493;&#1499;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; [punishment], which occurs, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/149-7.htm">Psalm 149:7</a>, in the sense of punishment inflicted by man.<p>(Note: Vid., Zunz, "Regarding the Idea and the Use of Tokhecha," in Steinschneider's Heb. Bibliographia, entitled &#1492;&#1502;&#1495;&#1499;&#1497;&#1512;, 1871, p. 70f.)<p>Besides, we must think first not of actual punishment, but of chastening, reproving words; and the man to whom are spoken the reproving words is one whose conduct merits more and more severe censure, and continually receives correction from those who are concerned for his welfare. Hitzig regards the first line as a conditional clause: "Is a man of punishment stiff-necked?".... This is syntactically impossible. Only &#1502;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; &#1506;&#1512;&#1507; could have such force: a man of punishment, if he.... But why then did not the author rather write the words &#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1488; &#1502;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; &#1506;&#1512;&#1507;? Why then could not &#1502;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; &#1506;&#1512;&#1507; be a co-ordinated further description of the man? Cf. e.g., <a href="/exodus/17-21.htm">Exodus 17:21</a>. The door of penitence, to which earnest, well-meant admonition calls a man, does not always remain open. He who with stiff-necked persistence in sin and in self-delusion sets himself in opposition to all endeavours to save his soul, shall one day suddenly, and without the prospect and possibility of restoration (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/19-11.htm">Jeremiah 19:11</a>), become a wreck.
