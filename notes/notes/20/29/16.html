He is a fool who tells every thing he knows, and can keep no counsel. 12. One who loves flatterers, and hearkens to slanderers, causes his servants to become liars and false accusers. 13. Some are poor, others have a great deal of deceitful riches. They meet in the business of this world; the Lord gives to both the comforts of this life. To some of both sorts he gives his grace. 14. The rich will look to themselves, but the poor and needy the prince must defend and plead for. 15. Parents must consider the benefit of due correction, and the mischief of undue indulgence. 16. Let not the righteous have their faith and hope shocked by the increase of sin and sinners, but let them wait with patience. 17. Children must not be suffered to go without rebuke when they do amiss. 18. How bare does a place look without Bibles and ministers! and what an easy prey is it to the enemy of souls!

Where the wicked get the upper hand in a community, their evil example is copied, and a lowering of moral tone and a general laxity in conduct prevail (see on ver. 12: comp. also ver. 2; <a href="/proverbs/28-12.htm">Proverbs 28:12, 28</a>). <span class="cmt_word">But the righteous shall see their fall.</span> Retribution shall overtake them, and God's justice shall be vindicated.

Of these, <a href="/proverbs/29-10.htm">Proverbs 29:10</a> and <a href="/proverbs/29-11.htm">Proverbs 29:11</a> are alike in respect of the tense used; <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/29-12.htm">Proverbs 29:12-14</a> have in common the pronoun pointing back to the first member.<p>10 Men of blood hate the guiltless<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the upright; they attempt the life of such<p>The nearest lying translation of the second line would certainly be: the upright seek his soul (that of the guiltless). In accordance with the contrasted &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1504;&#1488;&#1493;, the Aram. understand the seeking of earnest benevolent seeking, but disregarding the &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; in &#1500;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;;<p>(Note: The Targum translates &#1514;&#1501;, guiltlessness, and the Venet. (&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;) &#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, turning to <a href="/proverbs/1-22.htm">Proverbs 1:22</a>.)<p>Symmachus (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;), Jerome (quaerunt), and Luther thus also understand the sentence; and Rashi remarks that the phrase is here &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503; &#1495;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492;, for he rests; but mistrusting himself, refers to <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-1.htm">1 Samuel 21:1-15</a> :23. Ahron b. Josef glosses: to enter into friendship with him. Thus, on account of the contrast, most moderns, interpreting the phrase sensu bono, also Fleischer: probi autem vitam ejus conservare student. The thought is, as <a href="/proverbs/12-6.htm">Proverbs 12:6</a> shows, correct; but the usus loq. protests against this rendering, which can rest only on <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/142-5.htm">Psalm 142:5</a>, where, however, the poet does not say &#1488;&#1497;&#1503; &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;, but, as here also the usus loq. requires, &#1500;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;. There are only three possible explanations which Aben Ezra enumerates: (1) they seek his, the bloody man's, soul, i.e., they attempt his life, to take vengeance against him, according to the meaning of the expressions as generally elsewhere, used, e.g., at <a href="/psalms/63-10.htm">Psalm 63:10</a>; (2) they revenge his, the guiltless man's, life (lxx &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;), which has fallen a victim, after the meaning in which elsewhere only &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; &#1491;&#1468;&#1501; and &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/9-5.htm">Genesis 9:5</a>, occur. This second meaning also is thus not in accordance with the usage of the words, and against both meanings it is to be said that it is not in the spirit of the Book of Proverbs to think of the &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; [the upright, righteous] as executors of the sentences of the penal judicature. There thus remains<p>(Note: For &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; (will bring away?) &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;, understood after <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/45-5.htm">Jeremiah 45:5</a>, lies linguistically yet further off.)<p>the interpretation (3): the upright - they (the bloody men) seek the soul of such an one. The transition from the plur. to the sing. is individualizing, and thus the arrangement of the words is like <a href="/genesis/47-21.htm">Genesis 47:21</a> : "And the people (as regards them), he removed them to the cities," Gesen. 145. 2. This last explanation recommends itself by the consideration that &#1514;&#1501; and &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; are cognate as to the ideas they represents-let one call to mind the common expression &#1514;&#1468;&#1501; &#1493;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; [perfect and upright, e.g., <a href="/job/1-1.htm">Job 1:1</a>; <a href="/job/2-3.htm">Job 2:3</a>], - that the same persons are meant thereby, and it is rendered necessary by this, that the thought, "bloody men hate the guiltless," is incomplete; for the same thing may also be said of the godless in general. One expects to hear that just against the guiltless, i.e., men walking in their innocence, the bloody-mindedness of such men is specially directed, and 10b says the same thing; this second clause first brings the contrast to the point aimed at. Lutz is right in seeking to confute Hitzig, but he does so on striking grounds. </body></html>
