The body is a servant to the soul; those that humour it, and are over-tender of it, will find it forget its place. 22. An angry, passionate disposition makes men provoking to one another, and provoking to God. 23. Only those who humble themselves shall be exalted and established. 24.

The reluctant slave thoroughly understands the order given, but he pays no heed to it, will not trouble himself to execute it, and therefore must meet with stern treatment (comp. ver. 15; <a href="/proverbs/23-13.htm">Proverbs 23:13</a>, etc.; Proverbs 26:3).

Luther: Reiche [rich men], with the marginal note: "who can practise usury as they then generally all do?" Therefore Lwenstein understands the second line after <a href="/1_samuel/2-7.htm">1 Samuel 2:7</a> : God enlighteneth their eyes by raising the lowly and humbling the proud. But this line, after <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/22-2.htm">Proverbs 22:2</a>, only means that the poor as well as the rich owe the light of life (<a href="/psalms/13-4.htm">Psalm 13:4</a>) to God, the creator and ruler of all things - a fact which has also its moral side: both are conditioned by Him, stand under His control, and have to give to Him an account; or otherwise rendered: God maketh His sun to rise on the low and the high, the evil and the good (cf. <a href="/matthew/5-45.htm">Matthew 5:45</a>) - an all-embracing love full of typical moral motive.<p>(Note: &#1502;&#1488;&#1497;&#1512; has, by Lwenstein, Mehuppach Legarmeh, but incorrectly, since after Legarmeh two conjunctives cannot occur. Also Norzi with Mehuppach Mercha is irregular, since Ben-Asher recognises only two examples of this double accentuation to which this &#1502;&#1488;&#1497;&#1512; does not belong; vid., Thorath Emeth, p. 12. That the penultima toning &#1502;&#1488;&#1497;&#1512; in several editions is false scarcely needs to be remarked. Jablonski rightly points with Mehuppach on the ult., and Zinnorith on the preceding open syllable.) </body></html>
