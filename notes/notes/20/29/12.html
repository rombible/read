Some are poor, others have a great deal of deceitful riches. They meet in the business of this world; the Lord gives to both the comforts of this life. To some of both sorts he gives his grace. 14. The rich will look to themselves, but the poor and needy the prince must defend and plead for. 15. Parents must consider the benefit of due correction, and the mischief of undue indulgence. 16. Let not the righteous have their faith and hope shocked by the increase of sin and sinners, but let them wait with patience. 17. Children must not be suffered to go without rebuke when they do amiss. 18. How bare does a place look without Bibles and ministers! and what an easy prey is it to the enemy of souls!

But there is also this sequence of the accents, Munach, Dechi, Munach, Athnach, which separates &#1512;&#1506; and &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;. According to this, Ewald translates: "in the transgression of one lies an evil snare;" but in that case the word ought to have been &#1502;&#1493;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473; &#1512;&#1506;, as at <a href="/proverbs/12-13.htm">Proverbs 12:13</a>; for although the numeral &#1512;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; sometimes precedes its substantive, yet no other adjective ever does; passages such as <a href="/isaiah/28-21.htm">Isaiah 28:21</a> and <a href="/isaiah/10-30.htm">Isaiah 10:30</a> do not show the possibility of this position of the words. In this sequence of accents the explanation must be: in the wickedness of a man is the evil of a snare, i.e., evil is the snare laid therein (Bttcher); but a reason why the author did not write &#1502;&#1493;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473; &#1512;&#1506; would also not be seen there, and thus we must abide by the accentuation &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1512;&#1506;. The righteous also may fall, yet he is again raised by means of repentance and pardon; but in the wickedness of a bad man lies a snare into which having once fallen, he cannot again release himself from it, <a href="/proverbs/24-16.htm">Proverbs 24:16</a>. In the second line, the form &#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;, for &#1497;&#1512;&#1503;, is defended by the same metaplastic forms as &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;, <a href="/psalms/91-6.htm">Psalm 91:6</a>; &#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509;, <a href="/isaiah/42-4.htm">Isaiah 42:4</a>; and also that the order of the words is not &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1495; &#1493;&#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1503; (lxx &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#834;&#837; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#837;; Luther: frewet sich und hat wonne [rejoices and has pleasure]), is supported by the same sequence of ideas, <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/2-1.htm">Zechariah 2:1-13</a> :14, cf. <a href="/jeremiah/31-7.htm">Jeremiah 31:7</a> : the Jubeln is the momentary outburst of gladness; the Freude gladness, however, is a continuous feeling of happiness. To the question as to what the righteous rejoiceth over [jubelt] and is glad [greuet] because of, the answer is not: because of his happy release from danger (Zckler), but: because of the prosperity which his virtue procures for him (Fleischer). But the contrast between the first and second lines is not clear and strong. One misses the expression of the object or ground of the joy. Cocceius introduces into the second line a si lapsus fuerit. Schultens translates, justus vel succumbens triumphabit, after the Arab. ra&#770;n f. o., which, however, does not mean succumbere, but subigere (vid., under <a href="/psalms/78-65.htm">Psalm 78:65</a>). Hitzig compares Arab. raym f. i., discedere, relinquere, and translates: "but the righteous passeth through and rejoiceth." Bttcher is inclined to read &#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; &#1493;&#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1495;, he sees it (what?) and rejoiceth. All these devices, however, stand in the background compared with Pinsker's proposal (Babylon.-Heb. Punktationssystem, p. 156):<p>"On the footsteps of the wicked man lie snares,<p>But the righteous runneth and is glad,"<p>i.e., he runneth joyfully (like the sun, <a href="/psalms/19-6.htm">Psalm 19:6</a>) on the divinely-appointed way (<a href="/psalms/119-132.htm">Psalm 119:132</a>), on which he knows himself threatened by no danger. The change of &#1489;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; into &#1489;&#1508;&#1513;&#1474;&#1506; has <a href="/proverbs/12-13.htm">Proverbs 12:13</a> against it; but &#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1509; may be regarded, after <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/4-12.htm">Proverbs 4:12</a>, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/18-10.htm">Proverbs 18:10</a>, as the original from which &#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1503; is corrupted. </body></html>
