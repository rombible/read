The wisest course is, to look to God, and seek the favour of the Ruler of rulers; for every creature is that to us which God makes it to be. 27. The just man abhors the sins of the wicked, and shuns their company. Christ exposed the wickedness of men, yet prayed for the wicked when they were crucifying him. Hatred to sin in ourselves and others, is a needful branch of the Christian temper.

The word "abomination" (<span class="accented">toebah</span>) occurs more than twenty times in the Proverbs; it is appropriate here because the good man looks upon the sinner as the enemy of God, as the psalmist says, "Do not I hate them, O Lord, that hate  thee? and am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee? I hate them with perfect hatred: I count them thine enemies" (<a href="/psalms/139-21.htm">Psalm 139:21</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">He that is upright in the way is abomination to the wicked;</span> because he is a standing reproach to him, and by every tone and look and action seems to express his condemnation (see on Proverbs 21:15, and the Septuagint Version there; and comp. <a href="/1_kings/21-20.htm">1 Kings 21:20</a>: <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>; <a href="/matthew/8-34.htm">Matthew 8:34</a>; <a href="/john/15-19.htm">John 15:19</a>). Septuagint, "A direct way is an abomination to the lawless."

On the other hand, for &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1511;, the meaning to fondle; delicatius enutrire, is perfectly warranted by the Aram. and Arab. The Talmud, Succa 52b, resorts to the alphabet &#1489;&#1495;''&#1488;&#1496; in order to reach a meaning for &#1502;&#1504;&#1493;&#1503;. How the Targ. comes to translate the word by &#1502;&#1504;&#1505;&#1468;&#1495; (outrooted) is not clear; the rendering of Jerome: postea sentiet eum contumacem, is perhaps mediated by the &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; of Symmachus, who combines &#1504;&#1493;&#1503; with &#1500;&#1493;&#1503;, Niph. &#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;. The &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; of the lxx, with the Syr., von Hofmann has sought to justify (Schriftbew. ii. 2. 404), for he derives &#1502;&#1504;&#1493;&#1503;  equals  &#1502;&#1504;&#1492;&#1493;&#1503; from &#1504;&#1492;&#1492;. We must then punctuate &#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1503;; but perhaps the lxx derived the word from &#1488;&#1504;&#1503;  equals  &#1502;&#1488;&#1504;&#1493;&#1503;, whether they pronounced it &#1502;&#1504;&#1493;&#1503; (cf. &#1502;&#1505;&#1512;&#1514;  equals  &#1502;&#1488;&#1505;&#1512;&#1514;) or &#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1503;. To follow them is not wise, for the formation of the word is precarious; one does not see with the speaker of this proverb, to whom the language presented a fulness of synonyms for the idea of complaint, meant by using this peculiar word. Linguistically these meanings are impossible: of Jerome, dominus  equals  &#1502;&#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; (Ahron b. Josef, Meri, and others); or: the oppressed  equals  &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492;, from &#1497;&#1504;&#1492; (Johlson); or: one who is sick  equals  &#1502;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492; (Euchel). and Ewald's "undankbar" [unthankful], derived from the Arabic, is a mere fancy, since (Arab.) manuwan does not mean one who is unthankful, but, on the contrary, one who upbraids good deeds shown.<p>(Note: In Jahrb. xi. p. 10f. Ewald compares, in an expressive way, the Ethiopic manna&#769;na (Piel) to scorn; menu&#770;n, a reprobate; and manna&#770;n&#305;&#770;, one who is despised; according to which &#1502;&#1504;&#1493;&#1503; hcih could certainly designate "a man despising scornfully his own benefactors, or an unthankful man." But this verbal stem is peculiarly Ethiop., and is certainly not once found in Arab. For minnat (which Ewald compares) denotes benefaction, and the duty laid on one thereby, the dependence thereby produced. The verb (Arab.) minn ( equals  &#1502;&#1504;&#1503;) signifies to divide; and particularly, partly to confer benefaction, partly to attribute benefaction, reckon to, enumerate, and thereby to bring out the sense of obligation. Thus nothing is to be derived from this verbal stem for &#1502;&#1504;&#1493;&#1503;.)<p>The ancients are in the right track, who explain &#1502;&#1504;&#1493;&#1503; after the verb &#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;, <a href="/psalms/72-17.htm">Psalm 72:17</a>  equals  &#1504;&#1497;&#1503;  equals  &#1489;&#1468;&#1503;; the Venet., herein following Kimchi, also adopts the nominal form, for it translates (but without perceptible meaning) &#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;. Luther's translation is fortunate:<p>"If a servant is tenderly treated from youth up,<p>He will accordingly become a Junker [squire]."<p>The ideas represented in modern Jewish translations: that of a son (e.g., Solomon: he will at last be the son) and that of a master (Zunz), are here united. But how the idea of a son (from the verb &#1504;&#1493;&#1503;), at the same time that of a master, may arise, is not to be perceived in the same way as with Junker and the Spanish infante and hidalgo; rather with &#1502;&#1504;&#1493;&#1503;, as the ironical naming of the son (little son), the idea of a weakling (de Wette) may be connected. The state of the matter appears as follows: - the Verb &#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503; has the meanings of luxuriant growth, numerous propagation; the fish has from this the Aram. name of &#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;, like the Heb. &#1491;&#1468;&#1490;, from &#1491;&#1468;&#1490;&#1492;, which also means luxuriant, exuberant increase (vid., at <a href="/psalms/72-17.htm">Psalm 72:17</a>). From this is derived &#1504;&#1497;&#1503;, which designates the offspring as a component part of a kindred, as well as &#1502;&#1504;&#1493;&#1503;, which, according as the &#1502; is interpreted infin. or local, means either this, that it sprouts up luxuriantly, the abundant growth, or also the place of luxuriant sprouting, wanton growing, abundant and quick multiplication: thus the place of hatching, spawning. The subject in &#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492; might be the fondled one; but it lies nearer, however, to take him who fondles as the subject, as in 21a. &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514;&#1493; is either adv. accus. for &#1489;&#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514;&#1493;, or, as we preferred at <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/23-32.htm">Proverbs 23:32</a>, it is the subj. introducing, after the manner of a substantival clause, the following sentence as its virtual predicate: "one has fondled his servant from his youth up, and his (that of the one who fondles) end is: he will become a place of increase." The master of the house is thought of along with his house; and the servant as one who, having become a man, presents his master with &#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1491;&#1497; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;, who are spoilt scapegraces, as he himself has become by the pampering of his master. There was used in the language of the people, &#1504;&#1497;&#1503; for &#1489;&#1468;&#1503;, in the sense on which we name a degenerate son a "Schnes Frchtchen" [pretty little fruit]; and &#1502;&#1504;&#1493;&#1503; is a place (house) where many &#1504;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; are; and a man (master of a house) who has many of them is one whose family has increased over his head. One reaches the same meaning if &#1502;&#1504;&#1493;&#1503; is rendered more immediately as the place or state of growing, increasing, luxuriating. The sense is in any case: he will not be able, in the end, any more to defend himself against the crowd which grows up to him from this his darling, but will be merely a passive part of it. </body></html>
