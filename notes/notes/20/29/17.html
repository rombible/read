He is a fool who tells every thing he knows, and can keep no counsel. 12. One who loves flatterers, and hearkens to slanderers, causes his servants to become liars and false accusers. 13. Some are poor, others have a great deal of deceitful riches. They meet in the business of this world; the Lord gives to both the comforts of this life. To some of both sorts he gives his grace. 14. The rich will look to themselves, but the poor and needy the prince must defend and plead for. 15. Parents must consider the benefit of due correction, and the mischief of undue indulgence. 16. Let not the righteous have their faith and hope shocked by the increase of sin and sinners, but let them wait with patience. 17. Children must not be suffered to go without rebuke when they do amiss. 18. How bare does a place look without Bibles and ministers! and what an easy prey is it to the enemy of souls! That gospel is an open vision, which holds forth Christ, which humbles the sinner and exalts the Saviour, which promotes holiness in the life and conversation: and these are precious truths to keep the soul alive, and prevent it from perishing.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/29.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Left to himself - The condition of one who has been pampered and indulged.

Josef: &#1511;&#1496;&#1508;&#1497;&#1488;&#1493;&#1503;  equals  &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;), the former going back to the root-idea of extending (amplificare), the latter to that of going to a distance, putting away: sabbakh, procul recessit, distitit, hence &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1495;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/89-10.htm">Psalm 89:10</a>, and here properly to drive off into the background, synon. &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489; (Fleischer). But &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1495;&#1493;&#1512; (only here with &#1489;) is ambiguous. One might with Rashi explain: but the wise man finally, or afterwards (Symmachus, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0; &#787; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;; Venet. &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;  equals  &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;), appeaseth the anger which the fool lets loose; i.e., if the latter gives vent to his anger, the former appeases, subdues, mitigates it (cf. &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1504;&#1492;, &#1500;&#1488;&#1495;&#1493;&#1512;, <a href="/isaiah/42-23.htm">Isaiah 42:23</a>). But it lies still nearer to refer the antithesis to the anger of the wise man himself; he does not give to it unbridled course, but husheth it in the background, viz., in his heart. Thus Syr. and Targ. reading &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1488;, the former, besides &#1497;&#1495;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1489;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; (reputat eam), so also Aben Ezra: in the heart as the background of the organ of speech. Others explain: in the background, afterward, retrorsum, e.g., Nolde, but to which compescit would be more appropriate than sedat. Hitzig's objection, that in other cases the expression would be &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;, is answered by this, that with &#1489;&#1488;&#1495;&#1493;&#1512; the idea of pressing back (of &#1488;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;) is connected. The order of the words also is in favour of the meaning in recessu (cordis). Irae dilatio mentis pacatio (according to an old proverb). </body></html>
