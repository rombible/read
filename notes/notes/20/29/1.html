The word of God warns all to flee from the wrath to come, to the hope set before us in Jesus Christ. 2. The people have cause to rejoice or mourn, as their rulers are righteous or wicked. 3. Divine wisdom best keeps us from ruinous lusts. 4. The Lord Jesus is the King who will minister true judgment to the people. 5. Flatterers put men off their guard, which betrays them into foolish conduct. 6. Transgressions always end in vexations. Righteous men walk at liberty, and walk in safety. 7. This verse is applicable to compassion for the distress of the poor, and the unfeeling disregard shown by the wicked. 8. The scornful mock at things sacred and serious. Men who promote religion, which is true wisdom, turn away the wrath of God. 9. If a wise man dispute with a conceited wrangler, he will be treated with anger or ridicule; and no good is done. 10.

Compare "a man of sorrows" (<a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>). The hardening of the neck is a metaphor derived from obstinate draught animals who will not submit to the yoke (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-16.htm">Deuteronomy 10:16</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/2-20.htm">Jeremiah 2:20</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/27-8.htm">Jeremiah 27:8</a>). Christ calls his yoke easy, and bids his followers to bear it bravely (<a href="/matthew/11-29.htm">Matthew 11:29</a>. etc.). The reproofs may arise from the Holy Spirit and the conscience, from the teaching of the past, or from the counsel of friends. The LXX. (as some other Jewish interpreters) takes the expression in the text actively, "A man who reproves (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) is better than one of stiff neck." <span class="cmt_word">Shall suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy</span> (<a href="/proverbs/6-15.htm">Proverbs 6:15</a>; <a href="/proverbs/15-10.htm">Proverbs 15:10</a>).

And there is no hope in their end; despising all correction, they can have no possibility of restoration. We may refer, as an illustration, to that terrible passage in the Epistle to the Hebrews (<a href="/hebrews/6-4.htm">Hebrews 6:4</a>, etc.), and to the fate of the Jews unto  the present day.

Josef, Venet., J. H. Michaelis), is untenable - such a name given by the teacher here to himself is altogether aimless. Others translate, with Jerome: Qui corripit hominem gratiam postea inveniet apud eum magis, quam ille qui per linguae blandimenta decipit, for they partly purpose to read &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1470;&#1499;&#1503;, partly to give to '&#1488;&#1495; the meaning of postea. &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;, Ewald says, is a notable example of an adverb. Hitzig seeks to correct this adv. as at <a href="/nehemiah/3-30.htm">Nehemiah 3:30</a>., but where, with Keil, &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1493; is to be read; at <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/2-7.htm">Joshua 2:7</a>, where &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497; is to be erased; and at <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-30.htm">Deuteronomy 2:30</a>, where the traditional text is accountable.

It is a formation, like &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;, <a href="/1_kings/6-10.htm">1 Kings 6:10</a> (cf. Olshausen's Lehrb. p. 428f.), of the same termination as &#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;, &#1495;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;, and in the later Aram.-Heb. &#1494;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, and the like. The variant &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;, noticed by Heidenheim, confirms it; and the distinction between different classes of men (vid., vol. i. p. 39) which prevails in the Book of Proverbs favours it. A &#1488;&#1491;&#1501; &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497; is defined, after the manner of Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/7-24.htm">Jeremiah 7:24</a>): a man who is directed backwards, and not &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, forwards.

This centrifugal direction, leading to estrangement from the fear of Jahve, or, what is the same thing, from the religion of revelation, would lead to entire ruin if unreserved and fearless denunciation did not interpose and seek to restrain it; and he who speaks<p>(Note: Lwenstein writes &#1502;&#1493;&#1499;&#1497;&#1495;, after Metheg-Setzung, 43, not incorrectly; for the following word, although toned on the first syllable, begins with guttural having the same sound.)<p>so truly, openly, and earnestly home to the conscience of one who is on the downward course, gains for himself thereby, on the part of him whom he has directed aright, and on the part of all who are well disposed, better thanks (and also, on the part of God, a better reward, <a href="/james/5-19.htm">James 5:19</a>.) than he who, speaking to him, smooths his tongue to say to him who is rich, or in a high position, only that which is agreeable.

Thorath Emeth, p. 51), of only two words, with Mercha Silluk. </body></html>
