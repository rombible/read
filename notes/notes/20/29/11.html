He is a fool who tells every thing he knows, and can keep no counsel. 12. One who loves flatterers, and hearkens to slanderers, causes his servants to become liars and false accusers. 13. Some are poor, others have a great deal of deceitful riches. They meet in the business of this world; the Lord gives to both the comforts of this life. To some of both sorts he gives his grace. 14. The rich will look to themselves, but the poor and needy the prince must defend and plead for. 15. Parents must consider the benefit of due correction, and the mischief of undue indulgence. 16. Let not the righteous have their faith and hope shocked by the increase of sin and sinners, but let them wait with patience. 17. Children must not be suffered to go without rebuke when they do amiss. 18. How bare does a place look without Bibles and ministers! and what an easy prey is it to the enemy of souls! That gospel is an open vision, which holds forth Christ, which humbles the sinner and exalts the Saviour, which promotes holiness in the life and conversation: and these are precious truths to keep the soul alive, and prevent it from perishing.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/29.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Mind - The Hebrew word is used sometimes for "mind" or "reason," sometimes for "passion," or "wrath."

At once; tells all he knows, all that is in his breast; whatever he thinks, and all that he intends to do; what or whom he loves or hates. Or, "a fool brings out all his wrath"; so the Targum, Septuagint, Syriac, and Arabic versions: he cannot restrain it, nor hide it; it breaks out at once, even all of it, and is soon known, as in <a href="/proverbs/12-16.htm">Proverbs 12:16</a>; <p>but a wise man keepeth it in till afterwards; reserves his mind, and thoughts, and designs, to himself; and does not discover them until a proper opportunity offers, when to disclose them is most to advantage; or he restrains his wrath and anger, defers showing it to a proper time, when it may answer a better purpose, and he may do it without sin. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/29.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">A fool uttereth all his mind: but a wise man keepeth it in till afterwards.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/29.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">11</span>. <span class="ital">mind</span>] Lit. <span class="bld">spirit;</span> i.e. <span class="ital">passion</span>, or <span class="ital">anger</span>, R.V., <span class="greekheb">θυμόν</span>, LXX. <span class="ital">keepeth it in till afterwards</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">keepeth it back and stilleth</span> it, R.V.; <span class="greekheb">ταμιεύεται κατὰ μέρος</span>, LXX.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A fool uttereth all his mind;</span> <span class="accented">his spirit</span>; <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d7;&#x5d5;</span>, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>.

The wording of the second hemistich confirms this rendering. A fool pours out his wrath, restrained by no consideration. It is a wise maxim that says, "Command your temper, lest it command you;" and again, "When passion enters in at the foregate, wisdom goes out at the postern." So we have the word attributed to Evenus Parius - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;</span><br /><span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f7a;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Wrath often hath revealed man's hidden mind,<br />Than madness more pernicious."</span> A wise man keepeth it in till afterwards. This clause is capable of more than one explanation. The Authorized Version says that the wise man restrains his own anger till he can give it proper vent. The term <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;</span> occurs nowhere else, and is rendered "at last," "finally," and by Delitzsch, "within," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. in his heart. The verb rendered "keepeth in" (<span class="accented">shabach</span>) is rather "to calm," "to hush," as in <a href="/psalms/65-7.htm">Psalm 65:7</a>; <a href="/psalms/89-10.htm">Psalm 89:10</a>, "Which stilleth the noise of the seas." So we have the meaning: The wise man calms the auger within him; according to the proverb, <span class="accented">Irae dilatio</span>, <span class="accented">mentis pacatio</span>. Or the anger calmed may be that of the fool: The wise man appeases it after it has been exhibited; he knows how to apply soothing remedies to the angry man, and in the end renders him calm and amenable to reason. This seems the most suitable explanation. Septuagint, "A wise man husbands it (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) in part." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/29.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>5 A man who flattereth his neighbour<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Spreadeth a net for his steps.<p>Fleischer, as Bertheau: vir qui alterum blanditiis circumvenit; but in the &#1506;&#1500; there does not lie in itself a hostile tendency, an intention to do injury; it interchanges with &#1488;&#1500;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/36-3.htm">Psalm 36:3</a>, and what is expressed in line second happens also, without any intention on the part of the flatterer: the web of the flatterer before the eyes of a neighbour becomes, if he is caught thereby, a net for him in which he is entangled to his own destruction (Hitzig). &#1492;&#1495;&#1500;&#1497;&#1511; signifies also, without any external object, <a href="/proverbs/28-23.htm">Proverbs 28:23</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/2-16.htm">Proverbs 2:16</a>, as internally transitive: to utter that which is smooth, i.e., flattering. &#1508;&#1468;&#1506;&#1502;&#1497;&#1493; is, as <a href="/psalms/57-7.htm">Psalm 57:7</a>  equals  &#1512;&#1490;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;, for which it is the usual Phoenician word. </body></html>
