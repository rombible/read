He is a fool who tells every thing he knows, and can keep no counsel. 12. One who loves flatterers, and hearkens to slanderers, causes his servants to become liars and false accusers. 13. Some are poor, others have a great deal of deceitful riches. They meet in the business of this world; the Lord gives to both the comforts of this life. To some of both sorts he gives his grace. 14. The rich will look to themselves, but the poor and needy the prince must defend and plead for. 15. Parents must consider the benefit of due correction, and the mischief of undue indulgence. 16. Let not the righteous have their faith and hope shocked by the increase of sin and sinners, but let them wait with patience. 17. Children must not be suffered to go without rebuke when they do amiss. 18. How bare does a place look without Bibles and ministers! and what an easy prey is it to the enemy of souls! That gospel is an open vision, which holds forth Christ, which humbles the sinner and exalts the Saviour, which promotes holiness in the life and conversation: and these are precious truths to keep the soul alive, and prevent it from perishing.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/29.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Left to himself - The condition of one who has been pampered and indulged.

Thus Schultens, C. B. Michaelis, Umbreit, Ewald, Elster, and also Fleischer: "The doubled Vav is correlative, as at <a href="/exodus/21-16.htm">Exodus 21:16</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/5-3.htm">Leviticus 5:3</a>, and expresses the perfect sameness in respect of the effect, here of the want of effect. If the wise man, when he disputes with a fool, becomes angry, or jests, he will have no rest, i.e., he will never bring it to pass that the fool shall cease to reply; he yields the right to him, and thus makes it possible for him to end the strife." But the angry passion, and the bursts of laughter alternating therewith, are not appropriate to the wise man affirming his right; and since, after <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/9-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:17</a>, the words of the wise are heard &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1495;&#1495;, the &#1493;&#1488;&#1497;&#1503; &#1504;&#1495;&#1514; [and there is no rest] will cause us to think of the fool as the logical subject. So far correctly, but in other respects inappropriately, the lxx &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3c1; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b7; (after the expression &#1506;&#1501;, i.e., &#1506;&#1501;, instead of &#1488;&#1514;), &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3c1; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; (which &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1488;&#1493;&#1497;&#1500; does not mean) &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; (as if the words were &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1495;&#1514;).<p>(Note: According to this the Targum &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; &#1502;&#1514;&#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; (he remains obstinate), according to which the &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; &#1502;&#1514;&#1514;&#1508;&#1497;&#1512; (he does not lose his wits) of the Peshito is perhaps to be corrected. The distribution of the subjects is obscure.)<p>The syntactical relation would be simpler if &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496; in 9a were vocalized as a hypothetical perfect. But we read for it the past &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;. Ewald designates 9a as a conditional clause, and Hitzig remarks that the Lat. viro sapiente disceptante cum stulto corresponds therewith. It marks, like <a href="/1_samuel/2-13.htm">1 Samuel 2:13</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/1-16.htm">Job 1:16</a>, the situation from which there is a departure then with perf. consec.: if a wise man in the right is in contact with a fool, he starts up, and laughs, and keeps not quiet (supply &#1500;&#1468;&#1493; as at <a href="/proverbs/28-27.htm">Proverbs 28:27</a>), or (without &#1500;&#1493;): there is no keeping quiet, there is no rest. The figure is in accordance with experience. If a wise man has any controversy with a fool, which is to be decided by reasonable and moral arguments, then he becomes boisterous and laughs, and shows himself incapable of quietly listening to his opponent, and of appreciating his arguments. </body></html>
