Whatever difficulties the righteous meet in the way of duty, they are not daunted. 2. National sins disturb the public repose. 3. If needy persons get opportunities of oppressing, their extortion will be more severe than that of the more wealthy. 4. Wicked people strengthen one another in wicked ways. 5. If a man seeks the Lord, it is a good sign that he understands much, and it is a good means of understanding more. 6. An honest, godly, poor man, is better than a wicked, ungodly, rich man; has more comfort in himself, and is a greater blessing to the world. 7. Companions of riotous men not only grieve their parents, but shame them. 8. That which is ill got, though it may increase much, will not last long. Thus the poor are repaid, and God is glorified. 9. The sinner at whose prayers God is angry, is one who obstinately refuses to obey God's commands. 10. The success of ungodly men is their own misery. 11. Rich men are so flattered, that they think themselves superior to others. 12. There is glory in the land when the righteous have liberty. 13. It is folly to indulge sin, and excuse it. He who covers his sins, shall not have any true peace. He who humbly confesses his sins, with true repentance and faith, shall find mercy from God. The Son of God is our great atonement. Under a deep sense of our guilt and danger, we may claim salvation from that mercy which reigns through righteousness unto eternal life, by Jesus Christ our Lord. 14. There is a fear which causes happiness. Faith and love will deliver from the fear of eternal misery; but we should always fear offending God, and fear sinning against him. 15. A wicked ruler, whatever we may call him, this scripture calls a roaring lion, and a ranging bear. 16. Oppressors want understanding; they do not consult their own honour, ease, and safety. 17. The murderer shall be haunted with terrors. None shall desire to save him from deserved punishment, nor pity him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Perverse in his ways - literally, "Perverse in his double ways."

That observes the law of God; for, though he cannot perfectly keep it, yet he delights in it after the inward man; and with his spirit serves it, from a principle of love, in faith, and with a view to the glory of God, without mercenary and sinister ends. Such a man enjoys peace, and has a reward "in" though not "for" keeping the commands of it; so that it is his wisdom to observe it; and he may be truly called a wise man, <a href="/deuteronomy/4-6.htm">Deuteronomy 4:6</a>; Or that observes the law or commandments of his parents, which they enjoin him; see <a href="/proverbs/6-20.htm">Proverbs 6:20</a>; and particularly the law of God, which requires honour and obedience to be given to parents, and which turns to the account of children; it is well with them, and their days are prolonged on earth, and therefore they are wise that keep it, <a href="/ephesians/6-1.htm">Ephesians 6:1</a>; and such a wise son makes a glad father, as the contrary brings shame to him, as in the next clause; <p>but he that is a companion of riotous men shameth his father: that keeps company with gluttons, and indulges his sensual appetite with them; that "feeds" (d) such persons and himself, as some render the word; that gives up himself to an epicurean life: he brings himself at last to disgrace and poverty, and so causes shame to his father; who will be charged with neglecting his education, and indulging him in such a luxurious way of living; see <a href="/proverbs/10-5.htm">Proverbs 10:5</a>. <p>(d) "qui pascit", V.

"Law" is <span class="accented">torah</span>, as ver. 4; but it seems here to include not only the Decalogue, but also the father's instruction and commands. Such an obedient and prudent son brings honour and joy to a parent's heart (see <a href="/proverbs/10-1.htm">Proverbs 10:1</a>; <a href="/proverbs/29-3.htm">Proverbs 29:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He that is a companion of riotous men shameth his father;</span> literally, <span class="accented">he</span> <span class="accented">that feedeth</span>, <span class="accented">hath fellowship with</span>, <span class="accented">gluttons</span> (<a href="/proverbs/23-20.htm">Proverbs 23:20</a>). The son who herds with debauchers, and wastes his substance in riotous living, brings shame on, wounds, and insults, all connected with him. Such a one transgresses the Law and his father's commands, and brings them into contempt (comp. <a href="/proverbs/27-11.htm">Proverbs 27:11</a>). Hence the antithesis of the two clauses.

(cf. e.g., <a href="/isaiah/16-4.htm">Isaiah 16:4</a>);<p>(Note: The Targum of <a href="/proverbs/28-1.htm">Proverbs 28:1</a> is, in Bereschith rabba, c. 84, &#1506;&#1512;&#1511; &#1512;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1497;&#1506;&#1488; &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; &#1512;&#1512;&#1497;&#1508;&#1497;&#1503; &#1500;&#1492;&#1468;; that lying before us is formed after the Peshito.)<p>in 1b, &#1497;&#1489;&#1496;&#1495;, as comprehensive or distributive (individualizing) singular, follows the plur. subject. One cannot, because the word is vocalized &#1499;&#1468;&#1499;&#1508;&#1497;&#1512; and not &#1499;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1497;&#1512;, regard &#1497;&#1489;&#1496;&#1495; as an attributive clause thereto (Ewald, like Jerome, quasi leo confidens); but the article, denoting the idea of kind, does not certainly always follow &#1499;. We say, indifferently, &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497; or &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;, &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488; or &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488;, and always &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492;, not &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492;. In itself, indeed, &#1497;&#1489;&#1496;&#1495; may be used absolutely: he is confident, undismayed, of the lion as well as of the leviathan, <a href="/job/40-23.htm">Job 40:23</a>. But it is suitable thus without any addition for the righteous, and &#1504;&#1505;&#1493; and &#1497;&#1489;&#1496;&#1495; correspond to each other as predicates, in accordance with the parallelism; the accentuation is also here correct. The perf. &#1504;&#1505;&#1493; denotes that which is uncaused, and yet follows: the godless flee, pursued by the terrible images that arise in their own wicked consciences, even when no external danger threatens. The fut. &#1497;&#1489;&#1496;&#1495; denotes that which continually happens: the righteous remains, even where external danger really threatens, bold and courageous, after the manner of a young, vigorous lion, because feeling himself strong in God, and assured of his safety through Him. </body></html>
