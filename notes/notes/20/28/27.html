Here is the wickedness of those who think it no sin to rob their parents, by wheedling them or threatening them, or by wasting what they have, and running into debt. 25. Those make themselves always easy, that live in continual dependence upon God and his grace, and live by faith. 26. A fool trusts to his own strength, merit, and righteousness. And trusts to his own heart, which is not only deceitful above all things, but which has often deceived him. 27. A selfish man not only will not look out for objects of compassion, but will look off from those that call for his attention. 28. When power is put into the hands of the wicked, wise men decline public business. If the reader will go diligently over this and the other chapters, in many places where at first he may suppose there is least of Christ, still he will find what will lead to him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Hideth his eyes - i. e., Turns away from, disregards, the poor.

That gives alms unto them, relieves them in their distress, supplies them with money, food, or clothes, and does it cheerfully, largely, and liberally, as the case requires; such an one shall not want any good thing; he shall not be the poorer for what he gives; he shall not miss it, nor his substance be diminished; he shall not come to poverty and want, yea, he shall be enriched, and his substance increased, for more is intended than is expressed. Jarchi interprets this of a wise man not restraining doctrine from a disciple, but giving it to him liberally; <p>but he that hideth his eyes; that is, from the poor, as the Targum and Syriac version add; that does not care to see his person, to behold his miseries, or know his case, lest his heart should be moved with compassion, and should draw out anything from him; see <a href="/isaiah/58-7.htm">Isaiah 58:7</a>. Such an one <p>shall have many a curse; not only from the poor he hardens himself against, but from other persons, who observe his miserable and covetous disposition; and from the Lord himself, who abhors such persons, and curses their very blessings now, and will bid them depart from him as accursed persons hereafter. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/28.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">He that giveth unto the poor shall not lack: but he that hideth his eyes shall have many a curse.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/28.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">27</span>. <span class="ital">hideth his eyes</span>] in neglect or disgust.

God in some way compensates what is spent in almsdeeds by shedding his blessing on the benevolent. "Der Geiz," runs the German maxim, "sammlet sich arm, die Milde giebt sich reich," "Charity gives itself rich; covetousness hoards itself poor" (Trench). "Alms," said the rabbis, "are the salt of riches." <span class="cmt_word">But he that hideth his eyes shall have many a curse</span> (<a href="/proverbs/11-26.htm">Proverbs 11:26</a>). The uncharitable man either turns away his eyes that he may not see the misery around him, or pretends not to notice it, lest his compassion should be claimed. The expression, "hiding the eyes," occurs in <a href="/isaiah/1-15.htm">Isaiah 1:15</a>, "When ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you." The unmerciful man meets with the curses of those whom he has neglected to relieve when he had the power, and such curses are ratified and fulfilled because they are deserved, and Divine retribution attends them (see the opposite view, Ver. 20). "Turn not away thine eye from the needy," says the Son of Sirach, "and give him none occasion to curse thee; for if be curse thee in the bitterness of his soul, his prayer shall be heard of him that made him" (Ecclus 4:4, etc.; comp. Tobit 4:7). So in the 'Didache,' ch. 4, we have, <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "Thou shalt not turn thyself from one in need." Septuagint, "lie that turneth away his eye shall be in great distress;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">Qui despicit deprecantem sustinebit penuriam</span>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/28.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>With a proverb, in the first half of which is repeated the beginning of the second appendix, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/24-23.htm">Proverbs 24:23</a>, a new group commences:<p>21 Respect of persons is not good;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And for a morsel of bread a man may become a transgressor.<p>Line first refers to the administration of justice, and line second - the special generalized - to social life generally. The "morsel of bread," as example of a bribe by means of which the favour of the judge is purchased, is too low a conception. Hitzig well: "even a trifle, a morsel of bread (<a href="/1_samuel/2-36.htm">1 Samuel 2:36</a>), may, as it awakens favour and dislike within us, thus in general call forth in the will an inclination tending to draw one aside from the line of strict rectitude." Geier compares A Gellius' Noct. Att. i. 15, where Cato says of the Tribune Coelius: Frusto panis conduci potest vel ut taceat vel ut loquatur. </body></html>
