Here is the wickedness of those who think it no sin to rob their parents, by wheedling them or threatening them, or by wasting what they have, and running into debt. 25. Those make themselves always easy, that live in continual dependence upon God and his grace, and live by faith. 26. A fool trusts to his own strength, merit, and righteousness. And trusts to his own heart, which is not only deceitful above all things, but which has often deceived him. 27. A selfish man not only will not look out for objects of compassion, but will look off from those that call for his attention. 28. When power is put into the hands of the wicked, wise men decline public business.

Since the thoughts and imaginations of the thoughts of the heart are only evil, and that continually; they are vain and vague, sinful and corrupt; the affections are inordinate, the conscience defiled, the understanding darkened, and the will perverse; there is no good thing in it, nor any that comes out of it, but all the reverse; it is deceitful and desperately wicked: he must be a fool, and not know the plague of his heart, that trusts in it; and even for a good man to be self-confident, and trust to the sincerity of his heart, as Peter did, or to the good frame of the heart, as many do, is acting a foolish part; and especially such are fools as the Scribes and Pharisees, who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others, when a man's best righteousness is impure and imperfect, and cannot justify him in the sight of God; it is moreover a weak and foolish part in men to trust to the wisdom and counsel of their heart, to lean to their own understanding, even it, things natural and civil, and not to ask wisdom of God, or take the advice of men, and especially it, things religious and sacred; see <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5</a>; <p>but whoso walketh wisely; as he does who walks according to the rule of the divine word; who makes the testimonies of the Lord his counsellors; who consults with his sacred writings, and follows the directions of them; who walks as he has Christ for his pattern and example, and makes the Spirit of God his guide, and walks after him, and not after the flesh; who walks with wise men, and takes their advice in all matters of moment, not trusting to his own wisdom and knowledge; who walks as becomes the Gospel of Christ, and in all the ordinances of it; who walks inoffensively to all men, and so in wisdom towards them that are without, and in love to them who are within; who walks circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise, redeeming the time; <p>he shall be delivered; he shall be delivered from the snares of his own deceitful heart, which he will not trust; and from the temptations of Satan; and from all afflictions and troubles he meets with in the way; and from a final and total falling away; and from eternal death and destruction: "he shall be saved", as some versions render it, even with an everlasting salvation.

What is here censured is that presumptuous confidence in one's own thoughts, plans, and imaginations which leads a man to neglect both God's inspirations and the counsel of others (comp. ver. 14; <a href="/proverbs/14-16.htm">Proverbs 14:16</a>).

The best commentary on the gnome is <a href="/jeremiah/9-23.htm">Jeremiah 9:23, 24</a>, "Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his might, let not the rich man glory in his riches: but let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me, that I am the Lord which exercise loving kindness, judgment, and righteousness, in the earth: for in these things I delight, saith the Lord," <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/28.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>To this proverb of the cultivation of the land as the sure source of support, the next following stands related, its contents being cognate:<p>20 A strong, upright man is enriched with blessings;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But he that hastens to become rich remains not unpunished.<p>     &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/20-6.htm">Proverbs 20:6</a>, as well as &#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; '&#1488;, denotes a man bonae fidei; but the former expression refers the description to a constancy and certainty in the relations of favour and of friendship, here to rectitude or integrity in walk and conduct; the plur. refers to the all-sidedness and the ceaselessness of the activity. &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1499;&#1493;&#1514; is related, as at <a href="/proverbs/10-6.htm">Proverbs 10:6</a> : the idea comprehends blessings on the side of God and of man, thus benedictio rei and benedictio voti. On the contrary, he who, without being careful as to the means, is in haste to become rich, remains not only unblessed, but also is not guiltless, and thus not without punishment; also this &#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1504;&#1468;&#1511;&#1492; (e.g., <a href="/proverbs/6-29.htm">Proverbs 6:29</a>), frequently met in the Mishle, is, like &#1489;&#1512;&#1499;&#1493;&#1514;, the union of two ideas, for generally the bibl. mode of conception and language comprehends in one, sin, guilt, and punishment. </body></html>
