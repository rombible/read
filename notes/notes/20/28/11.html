Whatever difficulties the righteous meet in the way of duty, they are not daunted. 2. National sins disturb the public repose. 3. If needy persons get opportunities of oppressing, their extortion will be more severe than that of the more wealthy. 4. Wicked people strengthen one another in wicked ways. 5. If a man seeks the Lord, it is a good sign that he understands much, and it is a good means of understanding more. 6. An honest, godly, poor man, is better than a wicked, ungodly, rich man; has more comfort in himself, and is a greater blessing to the world. 7. Companions of riotous men not only grieve their parents, but shame them. 8. That which is ill got, though it may increase much, will not last long. Thus the poor are repaid, and God is glorified. 9. The sinner at whose prayers God is angry, is one who obstinately refuses to obey God's commands. 10. The success of ungodly men is their own misery. 11. Rich men are so flattered, that they think themselves superior to others. 12. There is glory in the land when the righteous have liberty. 13. It is folly to indulge sin, and excuse it. He who covers his sins, shall not have any true peace. He who humbly confesses his sins, with true repentance and faith, shall find mercy from God. The Son of God is our great atonement. Under a deep sense of our guilt and danger, we may claim salvation from that mercy which reigns through righteousness unto eternal life, by Jesus Christ our Lord. 14. There is a fear which causes happiness. Faith and love will deliver from the fear of eternal misery; but we should always fear offending God, and fear sinning against him. 15. A wicked ruler, whatever we may call him, this scripture calls a roaring lion, and a ranging bear. 16. Oppressors want understanding; they do not consult their own honour, ease, and safety. 17. The murderer shall be haunted with terrors. None shall desire to save him from deserved punishment, nor pity him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Wealth blunts, poverty sharpens, the critical power of intellect. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/28.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11.

A rich man thinks so highly of his position, is so flattered by parasites, and deems himself placed so immeasurably above social inferiors, that he learns to consider himself possessed of other qualifications, even mental and intellectual gifts, with which wealth has no concern. This purse-proud arrogance which looks upon financial skill and sharpness in bargaining as true wisdom, is confined to no age or country. <span class="cmt_word">But the poor man that hath understanding searcheth him out</span> (<a href="/proverbs/18-17.htm">Proverbs 18:17</a>). Wisdom is not to be bought with money. A poor man may be wise, his poverty probably making him a keener critic; and if he is brought into communication with this self-deluding plutocrat, he soon sees through him and recognizes his real value. Septuagint, "An intelligent poor man will condemn him." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/28.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>A similar antithetic distich:<p>Wicked men understand not what is right;<p>But they who seek Jahve understand all.<p>Regarding the gen. expression &#1488;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1470;&#1512;&#1506;, vid., under <a href="/proverbs/2-14.htm">Proverbs 2:14</a>. He who makes wickedness his element, falls into the confusion of the moral conception; but he whose end is the one living God, gains from that, in every situation of life, even amid the greatest difficulties, the knowledge of that which is morally right. Similarly the Apostle John (<a href="/1_john/2-20.htm">1 John 2:20</a>): "ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things" (&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;): i.e., ye need to seek that knowledge which ye require, and which ye long after, not without yourselves, but in the new divine foundation of your personal life; from thence all that ye need for the growth of your spiritual life, and for the turning away from you of hostile influences, will come into your consciences. It is a potential knowledge, all-comprehensive in its character, and obviously a human relative knowledge, that is here meant. </body></html>
