His friend and acquaintance, for any fault committed by him; which reproof he gives in a free and faithful manner, yet kind, tender, and affectionate. The word rendered "afterwards", which begins the next clause, according to the accents belongs to this, and is by some rendered, "he that rebuketh a man after me" (b); after my directions, according to the rules I have given; that is, after God, and by his order; or Solomon, after his example, who delivered out these sentences and instructions. The Targum so connects the word, and renders the clause, <p>"he that rebukes a man before him;'' <p>openly, to his thee: but rather it may be rendered "behind"; that is, as Cocceius interprets it, apart, alone, privately, and secretly, when they are by themselves; which agrees with Christ's instructions, <a href="/matthew/18-15.htm">Matthew 18:15</a>; <p>afterwards shall find more favour than he that flattereth with the tongue; for though the reproofs given him may uneasy upon his mind at first, and may be cutting and wounding, and give him some pain, and so some dislike to the reprover; yet when he coolly considers the nature and tendency of the reproof, the manner in which it was given, and the design of it, he will love, value, and esteem his faithful friend and rebuker, more than the man that fawned upon him, and flattered him with having done that which was right and well; or, as the Targum, than he that divideth the tongue, or is doubletongued; and so the Syriac version; see <a href="/proverbs/27-5.htm">Proverbs 27:5</a>. <p>(b) "post me", Montanus, Tigurine version, Baynus; so some in Vatablus and Michaelis, R.

The suffix cannot be that of the first person singular, which would give no sense; hence most interpreters see in it a peculiar adverb attached to the following verb, "shall afterwards find." Delitzsch. Lowenstein, end Nowack take it for a noun with the termination <span class="accented">-ai</span>, and translate, "a man that goeth backward," "a backslider" (as <a href="/jeremiah/7-24.htm">Jeremiah 7:24</a>).

A faithful counsellor, who tells a man his faults, brings them home to his conscience, and checks him in his downward course, will be seen to be a true friend, and will be loved and respected both by the one whom he has warned and advised and by all who are well disposed. <a href="/james/5-19.htm">James 5:19</a>, "If any of you do err from the truth, and one convert him. let him know that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and stroll hide a multitude of sins." "Laudat adulator, sed non est verus amator." The flatterer says only what is agreeable to the man whom he flatters, and thus makes him conceited and selfish and unable to see himself as he really is: the true friend says harsh things, but they are wholesome and tend to spiritual profit, and show more real affection than all the soft words of the fawning parasite.

Lwenstein persuades himself that &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511; may mean "having oppressed," and for this refers to &#1500;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;, having clothed, in the Mishna &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1497;, &#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;, Lat. coenatus, juratus; but none of all these cases are of the same nature, for always the conduct designated is interpreted as a suffering of that which is done, e.g., the drawing on, as a being clothed; the riding, as a being ridden, etc. Of &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;, in the sense of the oppression of another, there is no such part. pass. as throws the action as a condition back upon the subject. This is valid also against Aben Ezra, who supposes that &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511; means oppressing after the forms &#1488;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, &#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;, &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;, for of &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;, settled  equals  dwelling, that which has just been said is true; that &#1488;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; is equivalent to &#1488;&#1490;&#1512;, cf. regarding it under <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/30-1.htm">Proverbs 30:1</a>, and that &#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/137-8.htm">Psalm 137:8</a>, is equivalent to &#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1491;, is not true. Kimchi adds, under the name of his father (Joseph Kimchi), also &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1496;, <a href="/jeremiah/9-7.htm">Jeremiah 9:7</a>  equals  &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1495;&#1496;; but that "slaughtered" can be equivalent to slaughtering is impossible. Some MSS have the word &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1511;, which is not inadmissible, but not in the sense of "accused" (Lwenstein), but: persecuted, exposed to war; for &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511; signifies to treat hostilely, and post-bibl. generally to aspire after or pursue anything, e.g., &#1506;&#1505;&#1493;&#1511; &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497; &#1514;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492;, R. &#1506;&#1513;&#1474; (whence Piel contrectare, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/23-2.htm">Isaiah 23:2</a>, according to which &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511; appears to be an intensifying of this &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;). However, there is no ground for regarding &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;<p>(Note: Bttcher supposes much rather &#1506;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1511;  equals  &#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1511;; also, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/25-11.htm">Proverbs 25:11</a>, &#1491;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;  equals  &#1502;&#1491;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;; but that does not follow from the defectiva scriptio, nor from anything else.)<p>as not original, nor in the sense of "hard pressed;" for it is not used of avenging persecution, but: inwardly pressed, for <a href="/isaiah/38-14.htm">Isaiah 38:14</a> &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1492; also signifies the anguish of a guilty conscience. Whoever is inwardly bowed down by the blood of a man whom he has murdered, betakes himself to a ceaseless flight to escape the avenger of blood, the punishment of his guilt, and his own inward torment; he flees and finds no rest, till at last the grave (&#1489;&#1493;&#1512; according to the Eastern, i.e., the Babylonian, mode of writing &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;) receives him, and death accomplishes the only possible propitiation of the murderer. The exhortation, "let no one detain him," does not mean that one should not lay hold on the fugitive; but, since &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1498; &#1489;&#1468; does not mean merely to hold fast, but to hold right, that one should not afford him any support, any refuge, any covering or security against the vengeance which pursues him; that one should not rescue him from the arm of justice, and thereby invade and disturb the public administration of justice, which rests on moral foundations; on the other side, the Book of Prov; <a href="/proverbs/24-11.htm">Proverbs 24:11</a>., has uttered its exhortation to save a human life whenever it is possible to do so. The proverb lying before us cannot thus mean anything else than that no one should give to the murderer, as such, any assistance; that no one should save him clandestinely, and thereby make himself a partaker of his sin. Grace cannot come into the place of justice till justice has been fully recognised. Human sympathy, human forbearance, under the false title of grace, do not stand in contrast to this justice. We must, however, render &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1497;&#1514;&#1502;&#1499;&#1493;&#1470;&#1489;&#1493; not directly as an admonition against that which is immoral; it may also be a declaration of that which is impossible: only let no one support him, let no one seek to deliver him from the unrest which drives him from place to place. This is, however, in vain; he is unceasingly driven about to fulfil his lot. But the translation: nemine eum sustinente (Fleischer), is inadmissible; a mere declaration of a fact without any subjective colouring is never &#1488;&#1500; reven si g seq. fut. </body></html>
