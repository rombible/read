The true way to be happy, is to be holy and honest; not to raise an estate suddenly, without regard to right or wrong. 21. Judgment is perverted, when any thing but pure right is considered. 22. He that hastens to be rich, never seriously thinks how quickly God may take his wealth from him, and leave him in poverty. 23.

Not that his upright walk is the cause of this; the moving cause of salvation is the grace of God; the procuring cause, our Lord Jesus Christ, the only Author of it: but this is a descriptive character of the persons that are and shall be saved; it is a clear case that such have the grace of God, and therefore shall have glory; See Gill on <a href="/proverbs/10-9.htm">Proverbs 10:9</a>; <p>but he that is perverse in his ways; "in his two ways", as in <a href="/proverbs/27-6.htm">Proverbs 27:6</a>; or many ways, and all perverse and wicked: <p>shall fall at once; his destruction shall come suddenly upon him, when he is not aware of it, and when he cries, Peace, peace, to himself: or in one of them; in one or other of his perverse ways. <p>(r) "erit salvus", Pagninus, Montanus, V.

A proverb regarding riches closes this group, as also the foregoing is closed, and its commencement is related in form and in its contents to <a href="/proverbs/28-2.htm">Proverbs 28:2</a> :<p>12 When righteous men triumph, the glory is great;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And when the godless rise, the people are searched for.<p>The first line of this distich is parallel with <a href="/proverbs/29-2.htm">Proverbs 29:2</a>; cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/11-10.htm">Proverbs 11:10</a>, <a href="/proverbs/11-11.htm">Proverbs 11:11</a> : when the righteous rejoice, viz., as conquerors (cf. e.g., <a href="/psalms/60-8.htm">Psalm 60:8</a>), who have the upper hand, then &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1488;&#1512;&#1514;, bright prosperity, is increased; or as Fleischer, by comparison of the Arab. yawm alazynt (day of ornament  equals  festival day), explains: so is there much festival adornment, i.e., one puts on festival clothes, signum pro re signata: thus all appears festal and joyous, for prosperity and happiness then show themselves forth. &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492; is adj. and pred. of the substantival clause; Hitzig regards it as the attribute: "then is there great glory;" this supposition is possible (vid., <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/7-26.htm">Proverbs 7:26</a>, and under <a href="/psalms/89-51.htm">Psalm 89:51</a>), but here it is purely arbitrary. 28a is parallel with 12b: "if the godless arise, attain to power and prominence, these men are spied out, i.e., as we say, after <a href="//biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-12.htm">Zephaniah 1:12</a>, they are searched for as with lamps. &#1497;&#1495;&#1508;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474; &#1488;&#1491;&#1501; is to be understood after Obadiah, <a href="//biblehub.com/obadiah/1-6.htm">Obadiah 1:6</a>, cf. <a href="/proverbs/2-4.htm">Proverbs 2:4</a> : men are searched out, i.e., are plundered (in which sense Heidenheim regards &#1495;&#1508;&#1513;&#1474; as here a transposition from &#1495;&#1513;&#1474;&#1507;), or, with reference to the secret police of despotism: they are subjected to espionage. But a better gloss is &#1497;&#1505;&#1468;&#1514;&#1512; &#1488;&#1491;&#1501; 28a: the people let themselves be sought for, they keep themselves concealed in the inside of their houses, they venture not out into the streets and public places (Fleischer), for mistrust and suspicion oppress them all; one regards his person and property nowhere safer than within the four walls of his house; the lively, noisy, variegated life which elsewhere rules without, is as if it were dead. </body></html>
