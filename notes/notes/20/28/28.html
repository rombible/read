Here is the wickedness of those who think it no sin to rob their parents, by wheedling them or threatening them, or by wasting what they have, and running into debt. 25. Those make themselves always easy, that live in continual dependence upon God and his grace, and live by faith. 26. A fool trusts to his own strength, merit, and righteousness. And trusts to his own heart, which is not only deceitful above all things, but which has often deceived him. 27. A selfish man not only will not look out for objects of compassion, but will look off from those that call for his attention. 28. When power is put into the hands of the wicked, wise men decline public business.

It is certainly possible that an envious man consumes himself in ill-humour without quietness, as Hitzig objects; but as a rule there is connected with envy a passionate endeavour to raise oneself to an equal height of prosperity with the one who is the object of envy; and this zeal, proceeding from an impure motive, makes men blind to the fact that thereby they do not advance, but rather degrade themselves, for no blessing can rest on it; discontentedness loses, with that which God has assigned to us, deservedly also that which it has. The pret. &#1504;&#1489;&#1495;&#1500;, the expression of a fact; the part. &#1504;&#1489;&#1492;&#1500;, the expression of an habitual characteristic action; the word signifies praeceps (qui praeceps fertur), with the root-idea of one who is unbridled, who is not master of himself (vid., under <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/2-5.htm">Psalm 2:5</a>, and above at <a href="/proverbs/20-21.htm">Proverbs 20:21</a>). The phrase wavers between &#1504;&#1489;&#1492;&#1500; (Kimchi, under &#1489;&#1492;&#1500;; and Norzi, after Codd. and old editions) and &#1504;&#1489;&#1492;&#1500; (thus, e.g., Cod. Jaman); only at <a href="/psalms/30-8.htm">Psalm 30:8</a> &#1504;&#1489;&#1492;&#1500; stands unquestioned. &#1495;&#1505;&#1512; [want] is recognised by Symmachus, Syr., and Jerome. To this, as the authentic reading, cf. its ingenious rendering of Bereschith Rabba, c. 58, to <a href="/genesis/23-14.htm">Genesis 23:14</a>. The lxx reads, from 22b, that a &#1495;&#1505;&#1497;&#1491;, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;, will finally seize the same riches, according to which Hitzig reads &#1495;&#1505;&#1491;, disgrace, shame (cf. <a href="/proverbs/25-10.htm">Proverbs 25:10</a>). </body></html>
