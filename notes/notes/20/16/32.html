For the conquest of ourselves, and our own unruly passions, requires more true conduct, and a more steady, constant, and regular management, than the obtaining of a victory over the forces of an enemy. A rational conquest is more honourable to a rational creature, than a brutal one; it is a victory that doth nobody any harm; no lives or treasures are sacrificed to it, but only some base lusts. It is harder, and therefore more glorious, to quash an insurrection at home than to resist an invasion from abroad; nay, such are the gains of meekness, that by it we <span class="ital">are more than conquerors.</span><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/16.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>16:27,28. Ungodly men bestow more pains to do mischief than would be needful to do good. The whisperer separates friends: what a hateful, but how common a character! 29,30. Some do all the mischief they can by force and violence, and are blind to the result. 31. Old people especially should be found in the way of religion and godliness. 32. To overcome our own passions, requires more steady management, than obtaining victory over an enemy. 33. All the disposal of Providence concerning our affairs, we must look upon to be the determining what we referred to God; and we must be reconciled to them accordingly.

Than a mighty warrior or conqueror; as Alexander who conquered his enemies, and even all the world, and yet in his wrath slew his best friends: a man that is slow to anger is esteemed by the Lord, respected by men, and is happy in himself; and is preferable to the strongest man that is not master of himself and of his passions; <p>and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city; one that has the command of his temper, that can govern himself, and not suffer his passions to exceed due bounds, is superior in strength to him that can storm a castle or take a fortified city; it is easier to do the one than the other; courage of mind joined with wisdom, and assisted by a proper number of persons, may do the one; but it requires the grace of God, and the assistance of his spirit, thoroughly to do the other.

Of the many parallels to the sentiment of this proverb that are to be found in classical literature, none is closer than the familiar saying of Ovid (<span class="ital">Epist. ex Pont</span>. ii. 16:75):<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Fortior est qui se, quam qui fortissima vincit<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Mœnia; nec virtus altius ire potest.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Lange and others quote <span class="ital">Pirke Aboth</span>, iv.2, where the question; Who is a hero?, is answered by reference to this verse.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that is</span> <span class="cmt_word">slow to anger</span> (<a href="/proverbs/14-29.htm">Proverbs 14:29</a>) <span class="cmt_word">is better than the mighty.</span> The long suffering, non-irascible man is more of a hero than the valiant commander of a  great army. One overcomes external foes or obstacles; the other conquers himself; as it is said, <span class="cmt_word">And he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city</span> (<a href="/proverbs/25-28.htm">Proverbs 25:28</a>). 'Pirke Aboth,' 4:1, "Who is the hero? The man that restrains his thoughts." Maxims about self-mastery are common enough. Says an unknown poet, "Fortior est qui se quam qui fortissima vincit Moenia, nec virtus altius ire potest." So Publ. Syr., 'Sent.,' 795, "Fortior est qui cupiditates suas, quam qui hostes subjicit." And the mediaeval jingle - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Linguam fraenare<br />Plus est quam castra domare."</span> At the end of this verse the Alexandrian Manuscript of the Septuagint, followed by later hands in some other uncials, adds, "and a man having prudence [is better] than a great farm." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/16.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>26 The hunger of the labourer laboureth for him,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For he is urged on by his mouth.<p>The Syr. translates: the soul of him who inflicts woe itself suffers it, and from his mouth destruction comes to him; the Targ. brings this translation nearer the original text (&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1508;&#1488;, humiliation, instead of &#1488;&#1489;&#1491;&#1504;&#1488;, destruction); Luther translates thus also, violently abbreviating, however. But &#1506;&#1502;&#1500; (from &#1506;&#1502;&#1500;, Arab. 'amila, to exert oneself, laborare) means, like laboriosus, labouring as well as enduring difficulty, but not, as &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;, causing difficulty, or (Euchel) occupied with difficulty. And labour and the mouth stand together, denoting that man labours that the mouth may have somewhat to eat (cf. <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-10.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:10</a>; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;, however, gains in this connection the meaning of &#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#769;, and that of desire after nourishment, vid., at <a href="/proverbs/6-30.htm">Proverbs 6:30</a>; <a href="/proverbs/10-3.htm">Proverbs 10:3</a>). &#1488;&#1499;&#1507; also joins itself to this circle of ideas, for it means to urge (Jerome, compulit), properly (related to &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1507;, incurvare, &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1492; &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1488;, to constrain, necessitate), to bow down by means of a burden. The Aramaeo-Arab. signification, to saddle (Schultens: clitellas imposuit ei os suum), is a secondary denom. (vid., at <a href="/job/33-7.htm">Job 33:7</a>). The Venet. well renders it after Kimchi: &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0; &#787; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;. Thus: the need of nourishment on the part of the labourer works for him (dat. commodi like <a href="/isaiah/40-20.htm">Isaiah 40:20</a>), i.e., helps him to labour, for (not: if, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;, as Rashi and others) it presses upon him; his mouth, which will have something to eat, urges him. It is God who has in this way connected together working and eating. The curse in sudore vultus tui comedes panem conceals a blessing. The proverb has in view this reverse side of the blessing in the arrangement of God. </body></html>
