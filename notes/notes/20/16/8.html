For the rest, cf. with 2a, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/14-12.htm">Proverbs 14:12</a>, where, instead of the subj. &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;, is used &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;, and with 2b, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/24-12.htm">Proverbs 24:12</a>, where God is described by &#1514;&#1468;&#1499;&#1503; &#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;. The verb &#1514;&#1468;&#1499;&#1503; is a secondary formation from &#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503; (vid., Hupfeld on <a href="/psalms/5-7.htm">Psalm 5:7</a>), like &#1514;&#1468;&#1499;&#1503; from Arab. tyak&#803;n (to be fast, sure), the former through the medium of the reflex. &#1492;&#1514;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1504;&#1503;, the latter of the reflex. Arab. a&#770;itk&#803;n; &#1514;&#1468;&#1499;&#1503; means to regulate (from regula, a rule), to measure off, to weigh, here not to bring into a condition right according to rule (Theodotion, &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;, stabiliens, Syr. Targ. &#1502;&#1514;&#1511;&#1468;&#1503;, Venet. &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;; Luther, "but the Lord maketh the heart sure"), but to measure or weigh, and therefore to estimate rightly, to know accurately (Jerome, spiritum ponderator est Dominus). The judgment of a man regarding the cause of life, which it is good for him to enter upon, lies exposed to great and subtle self-deception; but God has the measure and weight, i.e., the means of proving, so as to value the spirits according to their true moral worth; his investigation goes to the root (cf. &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;, <a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>), his judgment rests on the knowledge of the true state of the matter, and excludes all deception, so that thus a man can escape the danger of delusion by no other means than by placing his way, i.e., his external and internal life, in the light of the word of God, and desiring for himself the all-penetrating test of the Searcher of hearts (<a href="/psalms/139-23.htm">Psalm 139:23</a>.), and the self-knowledge corresponding to the result of this test. </body></html>
