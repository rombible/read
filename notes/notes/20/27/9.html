Similarly, perfumes prepared from spices, roses, and aromatic plants were employed; rooms were fumigated, persons were sprinkled with rose water, and incense was applied to the face and beard, as we read (<a href="/daniel/2-46.htm">Daniel 2:46</a>) that Nebuchadnezzar ordered that to Daniel, in recognition of his wisdom, should be offered an oblation and sweet odours (see 'Dick of Bible,' and Kitto, 'Cyclop.,' <span class="accented">voc</span>. "Perfumes"). The heat of the climate, the insalubrious character of the houses, the profuse perspiration of the assembled guests, rendered this attention peculiarly acceptable (comp. <a href="/songs/3-6.htm">Song of Solomon 3:6</a>). The LXX., probably with a tacit reference to <a href="/psalms/104-15.htm">Psalm 104:15</a>, renders, "The heart delighteth in ointments, and wines, and perfumes." <span class="cmt_word">So doth the sweetness of a man's friend by hearty counsel.</span> This is rather clumsy; the Revised Version improves it by paraphrasing, <span class="accented">that cometh from hearty counsel</span>. The meaning is that as ointment, etc., gladden the heart, so do the sweet and loving words of one who speaks from the depths of his soul. The idea is primarily of a friend who gives wise counsel, speaking the truth in love, or shows his approval by discreet commendation. The LXX. has pointed differently, and translates, "But the soul is broken by calamities (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x1f75;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>);" Vulgate, "The soul is sweetened by the good counsels of a friend." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/27.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The second pair of proverbs designates two kinds of violent passion as unbearable:<p>3 The heaviness of a stone, the weight of sand - <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; A fool's wrath is heavier than both.<p>We do not translate: Gravis est petra et onerosa arena, so that the substantives stand for strengthening the idea, instead of the corresponding adjective (Fleischer, as the lxx, Jerome, Syr., Targum); the two pairs of words stand, as 4a, in genit. relation (cf. on the contrary, <a href="/proverbs/31-30.htm">Proverbs 31:30</a>), and it is as if the poet said: represent to thyself the heaviness of a stone and the weight of sand, and thou shalt find that the wrath of a fool compared thereto is still heavier, viz., for him who has to bear it; thus heavier, not for the fool himself (Hitzig, Zckler, Dchsel), but for others against whom his anger goes forth. A Jewish proverb (vid., Tendlau, No. 901) says, that one knows a man by his wine-glass (&#1499;&#1493;&#1505;), his purse (&#1499;&#1497;&#1505;), and his anger (&#1499;&#1506;&#1505;), viz., how he deports himself in the tumult; and another says that one reads what is in a man &#1489;&#1497;&#1493;&#1501; &#1499;&#1506;&#1505;&#1493;, when he is in an ill-humour. Thus also &#1499;&#1506;&#1505; is to be here understood: the fool in a state of angry, wrathful excitement is so far not master of himself that the worst is to be feared; he sulks and shows hatred, and rages without being appeased; no one can calculate what he may attempt, his behaviour is unendurable.
