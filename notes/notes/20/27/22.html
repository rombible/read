The contentions of a neighbour may be like a sharp shower, troublesome for a time; the contentions of a wife are like constant rain. 17. We are cautioned to take heed whom we converse with. And directed to have in view, in conversation, to make one another wiser and better. 18. Though a calling be laborious and despised, yet those who keep to it, will find there is something to be got by it. God is a Master who has engaged to honour those who serve him faithfully. 19. One corrupt heart is like another; so are sanctified hearts: the former bear the same image of the earthly, the latter the same image of the heavenly. Let us carefully watch our own hearts, comparing them with the word of God. 20. Two things are here said to be never satisfied, death and sin. The appetites of the carnal mind for profit or pleasure are always desiring more. Those whose eyes are ever toward the Lord, are satisfied in him, and shall for ever be so. 21. Silver and gold are tried by putting them into the furnace and fining-pot; so is a man tried by praising him. 22. Some are so bad, that even severe methods do not answer the end; what remains but that they should be rejected? The new-creating power of God's grace alone is able to make a change. 23-27. We ought to have some business to do in this world, and not to live in idleness, and not to meddle with what we do not understand. We must be diligent and take pains. Let us do what we can, still the world cannot be secured to us, therefore we must choose a more lasting portion; but by the blessing of God upon our honest labours, we may expect to enjoy as much of earthly blessings as is good for us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Bray - To pound wheat in a mortar with a pestle, in order to free the wheat from its husks and impurities, is to go through a far more elaborate process than threshing.

Of course, the process of separating the husks from the corn by the use of pestle and mortar is much more delicate and careful than threshing in the usual clumsy way; hence is expressed the idea that the most elaborate pains are wasted on the incorrigible fool (see on Proverbs 1:20). His foolishness will not depart from him. An obstinate, self-willed, unprincipled man cannot be reformed by any means; his folly has become a second nature, and is not to be eliminated by any teaching, discipline, or severity. There is, too, a judicial blindness, when, after repeated warnings wilfully rejected and scorned, the sinner is left to himself, given over to a reprobate mind "Whoso teacheth a fool," Siracides pronounces, "is as one that glueth a potsherd together, and as he that waketh one from a sound sleep" (Ecclus. 22:7). Again, "The inner parts of a fool are like a broken vessel, and he will hold no knowledge as long as he liveth" (Ecclus. 21:14). In Turkey, we are told, great criminals were beaten to pieces in huge mortars of iron, in which they usually pounded rice. "You cannot straighten a dog's tail, try as you may," says a Telugu maxim (Lane). There is a saying of Schiller's which is quite proverbial, "Heaven and earth fight in vain against a dunce." Horace, 'Epist.,' 1:10, 24 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Naturam expellas furca, tamen usque recurret."</span> Juvenal, 'Sat.,' 13:239 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Tamen ad mores natura recurrit<br />Damnatos, fixa et mutari nescia."</span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/27.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>This verse stands in close connection with the preceding, for it speaks of the contentious woman:<p>He that restraineth her restraineth the wind,<p>And oil meeteth his right hand.<p>The connection of the plur. subject &#1510;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492;  equals  quicunque eam cohibet, with a sing. predicate, is not to be disputed (vid., <a href="/proverbs/3-18.htm">Proverbs 3:18</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/28-16.htm">Proverbs 28:16</a>, Cheth&#305;&#770;b); but can &#1510;&#1508;&#1503; gain from the meaning of preserving, laying up, also the meanings of keeping, of confining, and shutting up? - for these meanings we have &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488; and &#1506;&#1510;&#1512; (cf. &#1510;&#1512;&#1512;, <a href="/proverbs/30-4.htm">Proverbs 30:4</a>). In 16b it lies nearer to see in &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493; the object of the clause (oil meeteth his right hand) than the subject (his right hand meeteth oil), for the gender of &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1503; directs to &#1497;&#1491; (e.g., <a href="/ezekiel/15-6.htm">Ezekiel 15:6</a>; cf. 6a, where &#1504;&#1488;&#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497; is as to gender indifferent): it is fem., while on the contrary &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1503; is generally masc. (cf. Sol 1:3). There is no reason for regarding &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493; as an adverbial accus. (he meets oil with his right hand), or, with Hitzig, as a second subject (he meets oil, his right hand); the latter, in the order of the words lying before us, is not at all possible. We suppose that &#1497;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488;, as at <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/49-1.htm">Genesis 49:1</a>, is equivalent to &#1497;&#1511;&#1512;&#1492; (Ewald, 116c), for the explanation oleum dexterae ejus praeconem agit (Cocceius, Schultens) does not explain, but only darkens: and oleum dexter su legit, i.e., colligit (Fleischer), is based on an untenable use of the word. As one may say of person to person, &#1511;&#1512;&#1498;, occurrit tibi, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/25-18.htm">Numbers 25:18</a>, so also &#1497;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488; (&#1497;&#1511;&#1512;&#1492;), of a thing that meets a man or one of his members; and if we compare &#1500;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488;&#1514; and &#1511;&#1512;&#1497;, then for 16b the meaning is possible: oil meets his right hand; the quarrelsome woman is like oil that cannot be held in the hand, which struggles against that which holds it, for it always glides out of the hand. Thus also Luther: "and seeks to hold oil with his hand," as if he read &#1497;&#1511;&#1502;&#1509;. In fact, this word was more commonly used as the expression of untenableness than the colourless and singular word &#1497;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488;, which, besides, is so ambiguous, that none of the old translators has thought on any other &#1511;&#1512;&#1488; than that which signifies "to call," "to name." The Jewish interpreters also adhere to this nearest lying &#1511;&#1512;&#1488;, and, moreover, explain, as the Syr., Targ., Aquila, Symmachus, Jerome, and the Venet., &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1503; &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;, according to the accentuation as genit. connected, e.g., Rashi: he calls for oil to his right hand, viz., as the means of purification from leprosy, <a href="/leviticus/8-14.htm">Leviticus 8:14</a> [<a href="/leviticus/14-16.htm">Leviticus 14:16</a>]; and Aben Ezra: even when he calls for oil to his right hand, i.e., would move them to silence with the precious anointing oil. Perhaps <a href="/proverbs/27-16.htm">Proverbs 27:16</a> was originally an independent proverb as follows:<p>&#1510;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497; &#1492;&#1493;&#1503; &#1510;&#1508;&#1503; &#1512;&#1493;&#1495;<p>&#1493;&#1513;&#1502;&#1503; &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493; &#1497;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488;<p>He who layeth up riches in store layeth up the wind,<p>And he nameth them the fat of his right hand;<p>i.e., he sees in them that which makes his right hand fat and strong (&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1503;, as at <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/109-24.htm">Psalm 109:24</a>, opp. <a href="/zechariah/11-17.htm">Zechariah 11:17</a>; cf. &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493;, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/10-16.htm">Isaiah 10:16</a>, and regarding &#x395;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;, the Phoenician god of health, at <a href="/isaiah/59-10.htm">Isaiah 59:10</a>), and yet it is only the wind, i.e., something that is worthless and transient, which he stored up (&#1510;&#1508;&#1503;, as at <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/13-22.htm">Proverbs 13:22</a>, and in &#1502;&#1510;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493;, Obad. Oba 1:6). &#1492;&#1493;&#1503; is used as it frequently occurs in the Book of Proverbs, e.g., <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/11-4.htm">Proverbs 11:4</a>, and the whole proverb expresses by another figure the same as <a href="/proverbs/18-11.htm">Proverbs 18:11</a>. The fact that &#1510;&#1508;&#1493;&#1503; (&#1512;&#1493;&#1495;), <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/25-23.htm">Proverbs 25:23</a>, and as a contrast thereto in the compass &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1503; (the south), hovered before the poet, may not have been without its influence on the choice of the words and expression here. </body></html>
