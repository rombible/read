The contentions of a neighbour may be like a sharp shower, troublesome for a time; the contentions of a wife are like constant rain. 17. We are cautioned to take heed whom we converse with. And directed to have in view, in conversation, to make one another wiser and better. 18. Though a calling be laborious and despised, yet those who keep to it, will find there is something to be got by it. God is a Master who has engaged to honour those who serve him faithfully. 19. One corrupt heart is like another; so are sanctified hearts: the former bear the same image of the earthly, the latter the same image of the heavenly. Let us carefully watch our own hearts, comparing them with the word of God. 20. Two things are here said to be never satisfied, death and sin. The appetites of the carnal mind for profit or pleasure are always desiring more. Those whose eyes are ever toward the Lord, are satisfied in him, and shall for ever be so. 21. Silver and gold are tried by putting them into the furnace and fining-pot; so is a man tried by praising him. 22. Some are so bad, that even severe methods do not answer the end; what remains but that they should be rejected? The new-creating power of God's grace alone is able to make a change. 23-27. We ought to have some business to do in this world, and not to live in idleness, and not to meddle with what we do not understand. We must be diligent and take pains. Let us do what we can, still the world cannot be secured to us, therefore we must choose a more lasting portion; but by the blessing of God upon our honest labours, we may expect to enjoy as much of earthly blessings as is good for us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Continual dropping - Here, as in the marginal reference, the flat, earthen roof of Eastern houses, always liable to cracks and leakage, supplies the groundwork of the similitude. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/27.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15.

The pred. &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1468;&#1495; comprehends frankincense or oil as the two sides of one and the same thing; the lxx introduces, from <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/104-15.htm">Psalm 104:15</a>, also wine. It also reads &#1493;&#1502;&#1514;&#1511; &#1512;&#1506;&#1492; as one word, &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1514;&#1511;&#1512;&#1506;&#1514;: &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#769;, which Hitzig regards as original; for he translates, understanding &#1502;&#1506;&#1510;&#1514; after <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/13-3.htm">Psalm 13:3</a>, "but the soul is torn by cares." But why &#1502;&#1514;&#1511;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492;, this Hithpa. without example, for &#1504;&#1511;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492;? and now connected with &#1502;&#1503; in the sense of &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;! And what does one gain by this Alexandrian wisdom [of the lxx] - a contrast to 9a which is altogether incongruous? Dderlein's rendering accords far better with 9a: "but the sweetness of a friend surpasses fragrant wood." But although this rendering of the word [&#1506;&#1510;&#1492;] by "fragrant wood" is found in Gesen. Lex., from one edition to another, yet it must be rejected; for the word signifies wood as the contents of trees, the word for aromatic wood must be &#1506;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501;; and if the poet had not intentionally aimed at dubiety, he ought to have written &#1506;&#1510;&#1497; &#1489;&#1513;&#1474;&#1501;, since &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;, which the exception of <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/3-20.htm">Isaiah 3:20</a>, where it is beyond doubt, nowhere means fragrance. If we read &#1506;&#1510;&#1514; and &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; together, then we may suppose that the latter designates the soul, as at <a href="/psalms/13-3.htm">Psalm 13:3</a>; and the former, counsel (from the verb &#1497;&#1506;&#1509;). But to what does the suffix of &#1512;&#1506;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; refer? One may almost conjecture that the words originally were &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1514;&#1511; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; &#1502;&#1506;&#1510;&#1514; &#1512;&#1506;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;, and the sweetness of the soul (i.e., a sweet relish for it, cf. <a href="/proverbs/27-7.htm">Proverbs 27:7</a> and <a href="/proverbs/16-24.htm">Proverbs 16:24</a>) consists in the counsel of a friend, according to which Jerome translates: et bonis amici conciliis anima dulcoratur. By this transposition &#1512;&#1506;&#1492;&#1493; refers back to &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;; for is nephesh denote a person or a living being, it can be construed ad sensum as masc., e.g., <a href="/numbers/31-28.htm">Numbers 31:28</a>. But the words may remain in the order in which they are transmitted to us. It is possible that &#1512;&#1506;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; is (Bttcher refers to <a href="/job/12-4.htm">Job 12:4</a>) of the same meaning as &#1492;&#1512;&#1506; (the friend of one  equals  the friend), as &#1499;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493; denotes directly the whole; &#1495;&#1510;&#1497;&#1493;, the half; &#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;, the right time. Recognising this, Cocceius, Umbreit, Stier, and Zckler explain: sweetness, i.e., the sweet encouragement (&#1502;&#1514;&#1511;, in the sense of "sweetness (grace) of the lips," <a href="/proverbs/16-21.htm">Proverbs 16:21</a>) of a friend, is better than one's own counsel, than prudence seeking to help oneself, and trusting merely to one's own resources; thus also Rashi: better than what one's own soul advises him. But (1) &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; cannot mean one's own person (oneself) in contrast to another person; and (2) this does not supply a correct antithesis to 9a. Thus &#1502;&#1503; will not express the preference, but the origin. Accordingly Ewald, e.g., explains: the sweetness of a friend whom one has proceedeth from the counsel of soul, i.e., from such counsel as is drawn from a deep, full soul. But no proof can be brought from the usage of the language that &#1506;&#1510;&#1514;&#1470;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; can be so meant; these words, after the analogy of &#1491;&#1506;&#1514; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/19-2.htm">Proverbs 19:2</a>, mean ability to give counsel as a quality of the soul (<a href="/proverbs/8-14.htm">Proverbs 8:14</a>; <a href="/proverbs/12-13.htm">Proverbs 12:13</a>), i.e., its ability to advise. Accordingly, with Bertheau, we explain &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1495;&#1470;&#1500;&#1489; as the common predicate for 9a and 9b: ointment and perfume rejoice the heart, and (The Syr., Targ., well: even so) the sweet exhortation of a friend, from a soul capable of rendering counsel; also, this and this, more than that fragrance. This proverb is formed in the same way as <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/26-9.htm">Proverbs 26:9</a>, <a href="/proverbs/26-14.htm">Proverbs 26:14</a>. In this explanation &#1512;&#1506;&#1492;&#1493; is well referred back to &#1500;&#1489;: and (more than) the sweet advice of his friend. But not so that &#1512;&#1506;&#1492;&#1493; is equivalent to &#1512;&#1506; &#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1489;, for one does not thus speak; but the construction is as when we say, in the German language: Nichts thut einem Herzen woler als wenn sein Freund es mitfhlend trstet [nothing does more good to a heart than when a friend sympathizingly comforts it]; or: Zage nicht, tief betrbtes Herz! Dein Freund lebt und wird dir bald sich zeigen [Be not dismayed, deeply-troubled heart! thy friend lives, and will soon show himself to thee]. In such cases the word "Herz" [heart] does not designate a distinct part of the person, but, synecdochically, it denotes the whole person. </body></html>
