The three meanings are the following: (a) to smoke, Aram. &#1506;&#1496;&#1512;, whence &#1506;&#1514;&#1512;, vapour, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-11.htm">Ezekiel 8:11</a>, according to which the Venet., with Kimchi's and Parchon's Lex., translates: the kisses of an enemy &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, i.e., are fog; (b) to sacrifice, to worship, Arab. atar; according to which Aquila: &#x3b9;&#788;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769; (as, with Grabe, it is probably to be read for &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1; of the lxx); and agreeably to the Niph., but too artificially, Arama: obtained by entreaties  equals  constrained; (c) to heap up, whence Hiph. &#1492;&#1506;&#1514;&#1497;&#1512;, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-13.htm">Ezekiel 35:13</a>, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-6.htm">Jeremiah 33:6</a>, according to which Rashi, Meri, Gesenius, Fleischer, Bertheau, and most explain, cogn. with &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, whose Aram. form is &#1506;&#1514;&#1512;, for &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; is properly a heap of goods or treasures.<p>(Note: Vid., regarding this word, Schlottmann in Deutsch.-Morgenl. Zeitschrift, xxiv. 665, 668.)<p>This third meaning gives to the kisses of an enemy a natural adjective: they are too abundant, so much the more plentiful to veil over the hatred, like the kisses by means of which Judas betrayed his Lord, not merely denoted by &#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;, but by &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;, <a href="/matthew/26-49.htm">Matthew 26:49</a>. This, then, is the contrast, that the strokes inflicted by one who truly loves us, although they tear into our flesh (&#1508;&#1468;&#1510;&#1506;, from &#1508;&#1468;&#1510;&#1506;, to split, to tear open), yet are faithful (cf. <a href="/psalms/141-5.htm">Psalm 141:5</a>); on the contrary, the enemy covers over with kisses him to whom he wishes all evil. Thus also &#1504;&#1506;&#1514;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; forms an indirect contrast to &#1504;&#1488;&#1502;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;. </body></html>
