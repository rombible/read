This does not forbid preparing for to-morrow, but presuming upon to-morrow. We must not put off the great work of conversion, that one thing needful. 2. There may be occasion for us to justify ourselves, but not to praise ourselves. 3,4. Those who have no command of their passions, sink under the load. 5,6. Plain and faithful rebukes are better, not only than secret hatred, but than love which compliments in sin, to the hurt of the soul. 7. The poor have a better relish of their enjoyments, and are often more thankful for them, than the rich. In like manner the proud and self-sufficient disdain the gospel; but those who hunger and thirst after righteousness, find comfort from the meanest book or sermon that testifies of Christ Jesus. 8.

This is to be understood, not of rebuke publicly given; though Aben Ezra thinks public reproof is meant, which, arising from love, is better than that which is done in secret, though in love, as being more effectual; for rebuke among friends should be given privately, according to our Lord's direction, <a href="/matthew/18-15.htm">Matthew 18:15</a>; but it signifies reproof given faithfully and plainly, with openness of heart, and without mincing the matter, and palliating the offence; but speaking out freely, and faithfully laying before a person the evil of his sin, in all the circumstances of it, as the Apostle Paul did to Peter, when he withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed, <a href="/galatians/2-11.htm">Galatians 2:11</a>. Now such kind of reproof is better than such love to a person as will not suffer him to tell him of his faults, for fear of grieving him, or losing his friendship; or than such love as does not show itself in deeds, and particularly in faithful reproofs; for so to act is to hate a person, and suffer sin to be upon him, <a href="/leviticus/19-17.htm">Leviticus 19:17</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/27.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Open rebuke is better than secret love.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/27.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5</span>. <span class="ital">secret</span>] Better, with R.V., <span class="bld">that is hidden</span>; i.e. that does not manifest itself in rebuke, when it is needed.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Maurer quotes aptly from Seneca, <span class="ital">Ep</span>. 25, and Plautus <span class="ital">Trinum</span>.

To hold back blame, it has been said, is to hold back love. "I love not my friend," wrote Seneca ('Ep.,' 25), "if I do not offend him." Plautus, 'Trinum.,' 1:2, 57 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Sed tu ex amicis certis mi es certissimus.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">Si quid scis me fecisse inscite aut improbe,<br />Si id non me accusas, tu ipse objurgandus."</span> Publ. Syr., 'Sent.,' 16, "Amici vitia si feras, facis tua," which Erasmus expounds by adding, "If you take no notice of your friend's faults, they will be imputed to you." Cicero ('De Amicit.,' 24, 25) has some sensible remarks on this subject: "When a man's ears are shut against the truth, so that he cannot hear the truth from a friend, the welfare of such a one is hopeless. Shrewd is the observation of Cato, that some are better served by bitter enemies than by friends who seem to be agreeable; for the former often speak the truth, the latter never.... As therefore both to give and receive advice is the characteristic of true friendship, and that the one should act with freedom, but not harshly, and that the other should accept remonstrance patiently and without resistance, so it should be considered that there is no deadlier bane to friendship than adulation, fawning, and flattery." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/26.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>27 He who diggeth a pit falleth therein;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And he that rolleth up a stone, upon himself it rolleth back.<p>The thought that destruction prepared for others recoils upon its contriver, has found its expression everywhere among men in divers forms of proverbial sayings; in the form which it here receives, 27a has its oldest original in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/7-16.htm">Psalm 7:16</a>, whence it is repeated here and in <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:8</a>, and Sir. 27:26.
