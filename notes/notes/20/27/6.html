Plain and faithful rebukes are better, not only than secret hatred, but than love which compliments in sin, to the hurt of the soul. 7. The poor have a better relish of their enjoyments, and are often more thankful for them, than the rich. In like manner the proud and self-sufficient disdain the gospel; but those who hunger and thirst after righteousness, find comfort from the meanest book or sermon that testifies of Christ Jesus. 8.

This and the next verse afford examples of the antithetic form of proverb, where the second line gives, as it were, the reverse side of the picture presented by the first. The wounds which a real friend inflicts by his just rebukes are directed by truth and discriminating affection (see <a href="/psalms/141-5.htm">Psalm 141:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">But the kisses of an enemy are deceitful.</span> So St. Jerome, <span class="accented">Fraudulenta oscula odientis</span>. But the verb here used (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5ea;&#x5e8;</span>) has the meaning, among others, "to be abundant or frequent;" hence it is better to take it in this sense here, as "plentiful, profuse." An enemy is lavish with his Judas kisses to hide his perfidy and hatred. Septuagint, "More to be trusted are the wounds of a friend than the spontaneous (<span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>) kisses of an enemy." "Non omnis qui parcia," wrote St. Augustine ('Ep.,' 48, 'ad Vincent.'), "amicus est, neque omnis qui verberat, inimicus." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/26.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>28 The lying tongue hateth those whom it bruiseth;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And a flattering mouth causeth ruin.<p>The lxx, Jerome, the Targ., and Syr. render &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1504;&#1488; &#1491;&#1499;&#1497;&#1493; in the sense of non amat veritatem; they appear by &#1491;&#1499;&#1497;&#1493; to have thought of the Aram. &#1491;&#1499;&#1497;&#1488;, that which is pure; and thus they gain nothing else but an undeniable plain thought. Many Jewish interpreters gloss: &#1502;&#1493;&#1499;&#1497;&#1495;&#1497;&#1493;, also after the Aram.: &#1491;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493;  equals  &#1502;&#1491;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493;; but the Aram. &#1491;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497; does not mean pure in the sense of being right, therefore Elia Wilna understands him who desires to justify himself, and this violent derivation from the Aram. thus does not lead to the end. Luther, translating: "a false tongue hates those who punish it," explains, as also Gesenius, conterentes  equals  castigantes ipsam; but &#1491;&#1468;&#1498; signifies, according to the usage of the language before us, "bruised" (vid., <a href="/psalms/9-10.htm">Psalm 9:10</a>), not: bruising; and the thought that the liar hates him who listens to him, leads ad absurdum; but that he does not love him who bruises (punishes) him, is self-evident. Kimchi sees in &#1491;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493; another form of &#1491;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1488;; and Meri, Jona Gerundi in his ethical work (&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512;&#1497; &#1514;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1489;&#1492;  equals  The gates of Repentance), and others, accordingly render &#1491;&#1499;&#1497;&#1493; in the sense of &#1506;&#1504;&#1493; (&#1506;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493;): the lying tongue hates - as Lwenstein translates - the humble [pious]; also that for &#1491;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493;, by the omission of &#1493;, &#1491;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;  equals  &#1494;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497; may be read, is supposable; but this does not harmonize with the second half of the proverb, according to which &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503; &#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1512; must be the subject, and &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1504;&#1488; &#1491;&#1499;&#1497;&#1493; must express some kind of evil which proceeds from such a tongue. Ewald: "the lying tongue hates its master (&#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493;)," but that is not in accordance with the Heb. style; the word in that case should have been &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;. Hitzig countenances this &#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493;, with the remark that the tongue is here personified; but personified, the tongue certainly means him who has it (<a href="/psalms/120-3.htm">Psalm 120:3</a>). Bttcher's conjecture &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1468;&#1488; &#1491;&#1499;&#1497;&#1493;, "confounds their talk," is certainly a curiosity. Spoken of the sea, those words would mean, "it changes its surge." But is it then at all necessary to uncover first the meaning of 28a? Rashi, Arama, and others refer &#1491;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493; to &#1491;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;  equals  &#1504;&#1491;&#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; (&#1502;&#1491;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;). Thus also perhaps the Venet., which translates &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; (not: &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;) &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2;. C. B. Michaelis: Lingua falsitatis odio habet contritos suos, h. e. eos quos falsitate ac mendacio laedit contritosque facit. Hitzig objects that it is more correct to say: conterit perosos sibi. And certainly this lay nearer, on which account Fleischer remarks: in 28a there is to be supposed a poetic transposition of the ideas (Hypallage): homo qui lingua ad calumnias abutitur conterit eos quos odit. The poet makes &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1504;&#1488; the main conception, because it does not come to him so readily to say that the lying tongue bruises those against whom it is directed, as that it is hatred, which is active in this. To say this was by no means superfluous. There are men who find pleasure in repeating and magnifying scandalously that which is depreciatory and disadvantageous to their neighbour unsubstantiated, without being at all conscious of any particular ill-will or personal enmity against him; but this proverb says that such untruthful tongue-thrashing proceeds always from a transgression of the commandment, "Thou shalt not hate thy brother," <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/19-17.htm">Leviticus 19:17</a>, and not merely from the want of love, but from a state of mind which is the direct opposite of love (vid., <a href="/proverbs/10-18.htm">Proverbs 10:18</a>). Ewald finds it incongruous that 28a speaks of that which others have to suffer from the lying tongue, whereas the whole connection of this proverb requires that the tongue should here be regarded as bringing ruin upon its owner himself. But of the destruction which the wicked tongue prepares for others many proverbs also speak, e.g., <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/12-13.htm">Proverbs 12:13</a>, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/17-4.htm">Proverbs 17:4</a>, &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503; &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;; and 28b does not mention that the smooth tongue (written &#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1492;&#1470;&#1495;&#1500;&#1511; with Makkeph) brings injury upon itself (an idea which must be otherwise expressed; cf. <a href="/proverbs/14-32.htm">Proverbs 14:32</a>), but that it brings injury and ruin on those who have pleasure in its flatteries (&#1495;&#1500;&#1511;&#1493;&#1514;, <a href="/psalms/12-3.htm">Psalm 12:3</a>; <a href="/isaiah/30-10.htm">Isaiah 30:10</a>), and are befooled thereby: os blandiloquum (blanditiis dolum tegens) ad casum impellit, sc. alios (Fleischer). </body></html>
