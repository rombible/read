Believers often have enough when worldly eyes see little; the Lord is with them, without the cares, troubles, and temptations which are with the wealth of the wicked. 18. He that is slow to anger, not only prevents strife, but appeases it, if kindled. 19. Those who have no heart to their work, pretend that they cannot do their work without hardship and danger. And thus many live always in doubt about their state, because always in neglect of some duty. 20. Those who treat an aged mother or a father with contempt or neglect, show their own folly. 21. Such as are truly wise, study that their thoughts, words, and actions should be regular, sincere, and holy. 22. If men will not take time and pains to deliberate, they are not likely to bring any thing to pass. 23. Wisdom is needed to suit our discourse to the occasions. 24.

In the multitude of counsellors they are established (<a href="/proverbs/24-6.htm">Proverbs 24:6</a>). We read of "counsellors" as almost regular officials in the Hebrew court, as in modern kingdoms (see <a href="/1_chronicles/27-32.htm">1 Chronicles 27:32</a>; <a href="/isaiah/1-26.htm">Isaiah 1:26</a>; <a href="/micah/4-9.htm">Micah 4:9</a>; comp. <a href="/ezra/7-28.htm">Ezra 7:28</a>). There is, of course, the danger of secrets being divulged where counsellors are many; and there is Terence's maxim to fear, "Quot heroines, tot sententiae;" but, properly guarded and discreetly used, good counsel is above all price.
