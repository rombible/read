Faithful, friendly reproofs help spiritual life, and lead to eternal life. 32. Sinners undervalue their own souls; therefore they prefer the body before the soul, and wrong the soul to please the body. 33.

It has happened to one in his reply to hit the nail on its head, and he has joy from that (&#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1495;&#1492; &#1489; after &#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1495; &#1489;&#1468;, e.g., <a href="/proverbs/23-24.htm">Proverbs 23:24</a>), and with right; for the reply does not always succeed. A reply like this, which, according to circumstances, stops the mouth or bringeth a kiss (<a href="/proverbs/24-26.htm">Proverbs 24:26</a>), is a fortunate throw, is a gift from above.
