'Pirke Aboth,' 3:26, "No wisdom, no fear of God; no fear of God, no wisdom. No knowledge, no discernment; no discernment, no knowledge." <span class="cmt_word">Before honour is humility</span> (<a href="/proverbs/18-12.htm">Proverbs 18:12</a>). A man who fears  God must be humble, and as the fear of God leads to wisdom, it may be said that humility leads to the honour and glory of being wise and reckoned among the wise (ver. 31). A man with a lowly opinion of himself will hearken to the teaching of the wise, and scrupulously obey the Law of God, and will be blessed in his ways. For "God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble" (<a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>; comp. <a href="/luke/1-52.htm">Luke 1:52</a>). The maxim in the second clause has a general application. "He that shall humble himself shall be exalted" (<a href="/matthew/23-12.htm">Matthew 23:12</a>; comp. <a href="/luke/14-11.htm">Luke 14:11</a>; <a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>). It is sanctioned by the example of Christ himself, the Spirit itself testifying beforehand his sufferings that were to precede his glory (<a href="/1_peter/1-11.htm">1 Peter 1:11</a>; see also <a href="/philippians/2-5.htm">Philippians 2:5</a>, etc.). Septuagint, "The fear of the Lord is discipline and wisdom, and the beginning of glory shall answer to it." Another reading adds, "Glory goeth before the humble," which is explained to mean that the humble set before their eyes the reward that awaits their humility, and patiently endure, like Christ, "who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God" (<a href="/hebrews/12-2.htm">Hebrews 12:2</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>27 Whoever does service to [servit] avarice troubleth his own house;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But he that hateth gifts shall live.<p>Regarding &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1506; &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1506;, vid., at <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/1-19.htm">Proverbs 1:19</a>, and regarding &#1506;&#1499;&#1512; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1493;, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/11-29.htm">Proverbs 11:29</a>, where it is subject, but here object.; <a href="/proverbs/28-16.htm">Proverbs 28:16</a> is a variation of 27b. &#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; are here gifts in the sense of <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:7</a>, which pervert judgment, and cause respect of persons.
