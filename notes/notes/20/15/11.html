Or "the grave" (a), which is the pit of destruction; where bodies being put, putrefy, and are destroyed by worms: this is known by the Lord, even the grave of everyone from the beginning; the graves of Adam, Abel, Abraham; he knows where their dust lies, and will raise it up again at the last day. Hades, or the invisible state of the departed, as the Septuagint has it, is manifest before him; he knows where departed spirits are; what their condition and employment be; and so the place and state of the damned, known by the name of "hell"; and may be called "destruction", where soul and body are destroyed by the Lord with an everlasting destruction; and is the destruction which the broad way of sin leads unto. Now though we know not where this place is, who are there, and what the torments endured in it; yet all is before the Lord, and known to him: "tophet" is ordained of old; everlasting fire is prepared by the Lord for devils and wicked men; see <a href="/job/26-6.htm">Job 26:6</a>; <p>how much more then the hearts of the children of men? which, though desperately wicked, are known by him; who is the searcher of the hearts and the trier of the reins of the children of men: he to whom hell is naked, and can look into that outer darkness, the blackness of darkness, can look into a man's heart, a second hell, in which all manner of wickedness is, and observe it all; he needs no testimony of man; he knows what is in man, all his secret thoughts, wicked purposes, designs, and devices; see <a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a>. <p>(a) "sepulchrum", Munster, Piscator, Mercerus, so Ben Melech. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/15.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{d}</span> Hell and destruction <i>are</i> before the LORD: how much more then the hearts of the children of men?</span><p>(d) There is nothing so deep or secret that can be hid from the eyes of God, much less man's thoughts.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/15.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">11</span>. <span class="ital">Hell and destruction</span>] <span class="bld">Sheol and Abaddon</span> with “<span class="ital">The grave</span>,” and “<span class="ital">Destruction</span>” in the marg. R.V. In their preface the Revisers explain that “with a view to obviate inevitable misunderstanding,” they “have left in the historical narratives the rendering (of A.V.) ‘the grave,’ or ‘the pit,’ with a marginal note, ‘Heb. Sheol,’ to indicate that it does not signify the place of burial; while in the poetical writings they have put most commonly ‘Sheol’ in the text, and ‘the grave’ in the margin.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In like manner, “Abaddon, which has hitherto been known to the English reader of the Bible only from the New Testament (<a href="/revelation/9-11.htm" title="And they had a king over them, which is the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but in the Greek tongue has his name Apollyon.">Revelation 9:11</a>), has been introduced in three passages (<a href="/job/26-6.htm" title="Hell is naked before him, and destruction has no covering.">Job 26:6</a>; <a href="/proverbs/15-11.htm" title="Hell and destruction are before the LORD: how much more then the hearts of the children of men?">Proverbs 15:11</a>; <a href="/proverbs/27-20.htm" title="Hell and destruction are never full; so the eyes of man are never satisfied.">Proverbs 27:20</a>), where a proper name appeared to be required for giving vividness and point.” Comp. for the thought, <a href="/job/26-6.htm" title="Hell is naked before him, and destruction has no covering.">Job 26:6</a>; <a href="/context/psalms/139-1.htm" title="O lord, you have searched me, and known me....">Psalm 139:1-16</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hell and destruction are before the Lord.</span> The two words rendered "hell" and "destruction" are respectively <span class="accented">Sheol</span> and <span class="accented">Abaddon, Infernus</span> and <span class="accented">Perditio</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f0d;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f7d;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> (comp. <a href="/proverbs/27-20.htm">Proverbs 27:20</a>). The former is used generally as the place to which the souls of the dead are consigned - the receptacle of all departed spirits, whether good or bad. Abaddon is the lowest depth of hell, the "abyss" of <a href="/luke/8-31.htm">Luke 8:31</a>; <a href="/revelation/9-2.htm">Revelation 9:2</a>, etc.; 20:l, etc. The clause means that God's eye penetrates even the most secret corners of the unseen world. As Job (<a href="/job/26-6.htm">Job 26:6</a>) says, "Sheol is naked before him, and Abaddon hath no covering" (comp. <a href="/psalms/139-7.htm">Psalm 139:7</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">How much more then the hearts of the children of men?</span> (For the form of the expression, comp. <a href="/proverbs/11-31.htm">Proverbs 11:31</a> and Proverbs 19:7; and for the import, <a href="/proverbs/16-2.htm">Proverbs 16:2</a>; <a href="/proverbs/21-2.htm">Proverbs 21:2</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/17-10.htm">Jeremiah 17:10</a>.) If God knows the secrets of the world beyond the grave, much more does he know the secret thoughts of men on earth. The heart is the source of action (see <a href="/matthew/15-19.htm">Matthew 15:19</a>, etc.). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>5 A fool despiseth his father's correction;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; But he that regardeth reproof is prudent.<p>We may with equal correctness translate: he acts prudently (after <a href="/1_samuel/23-22.htm">1 Samuel 23:22</a>); and, he is prudent (after <a href="/proverbs/19-25.htm">Proverbs 19:25</a>). We prefer, with Jerome, Venet., and Luther, the latter, against the lxx, Syr., and Targ., because, without a doubt, the &#1497;&#1506;&#1512;&#1501; is so thought of at <a href="/proverbs/19-25.htm">Proverbs 19:25</a> : the contrast is more favourable to the former. It is true that he who regardeth reproof is not only prudent, but also that he is prudent by means of observing it. With line first cf. <a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/1-30.htm">Proverbs 1:30</a>, and with line second, <a href="/proverbs/12-1.htm">Proverbs 12:1</a>. Luther translates: the fool calumniates...; but of the meanings of abuse (properly pungere) and scorn, the second is perhaps here to be preferred.</body></html>
