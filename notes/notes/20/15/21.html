Believers often have enough when worldly eyes see little; the Lord is with them, without the cares, troubles, and temptations which are with the wealth of the wicked. 18. He that is slow to anger, not only prevents strife, but appeases it, if kindled. 19. Those who have no heart to their work, pretend that they cannot do their work without hardship and danger. And thus many live always in doubt about their state, because always in neglect of some duty. 20. Those who treat an aged mother or a father with contempt or neglect, show their own folly. 21. Such as are truly wise, study that their thoughts, words, and actions should be regular, sincere, and holy. 22. If men will not take time and pains to deliberate, they are not likely to bring any thing to pass. 23. Wisdom is needed to suit our discourse to the occasions. 24.

They are so called on whom a misfortune, or several of them, press externally or internally. If such an one is surrounded by ever so many blessings, yet is his life day by day a sad one, because with each new day the feeling of his woe which oppresses him renews itself; whoever, on the contrary, is of joyful heart (gen. connection as <a href="/proverbs/11-13.htm">Proverbs 11:13</a>; <a href="/proverbs/12-8.htm">Proverbs 12:8</a>), such an one (his life) is always a feast, a banquet (not &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;, as it may be also pointed, but &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; and &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1491; thus adv., for it is never adj.; the post-bib. usage is &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1503; for &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514; &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1491;). Hitzig (and also Zckler) renders 15b: And (the days) of one who is of a joyful heart are.... Others supply &#1500;&#1493; (cf. <a href="/proverbs/27-7.htm">Proverbs 27:7</a>), but our rendering does not need that. We have here again an example of that attribution (Arab. isna&#770;d) in which that which is attributed (musnad) is a condition (hal) of a logical subject (the musnad ile&#770;hi), and thus he who speaks has this, not in itself, but in the sense of the condition; the inwardly cheerful is feasts evermore, i.e., the condition of such an one is like a continual festival. The true and real happiness of a man is thus defined, not by external things, but by the state of the heart, in which, in spite of the apparently prosperous condition, a secret sorrow may gnaw, and which, in spite of an externally sorrowful state, may be at peace, and be joyfully confident in God.</body></html>
