Believers often have enough when worldly eyes see little; the Lord is with them, without the cares, troubles, and temptations which are with the wealth of the wicked. 18. He that is slow to anger, not only prevents strife, but appeases it, if kindled. 19. Those who have no heart to their work, pretend that they cannot do their work without hardship and danger. And thus many live always in doubt about their state, because always in neglect of some duty. 20. Those who treat an aged mother or a father with contempt or neglect, show their own folly. 21. Such as are truly wise, study that their thoughts, words, and actions should be regular, sincere, and holy. 22. If men will not take time and pains to deliberate, they are not likely to bring any thing to pass. 23. Wisdom is needed to suit our discourse to the occasions. 24.

What Plautus (i) calls "asperam et terrestrem caenam", "a harsh and earthly supper", made of what grows out of the earth; which is got without much cost or care, and dressed with little trouble; a traveller's dinner, as the word (k) signifies, and a poor one too to travel upon, such as is easily obtained, and presently cooked, and comes cheap. Now, where there are love and good nature in the host that prepares this dinner; or in a family that partakes of such an one, having no better; or among guests invited, who eat friendly together; or in the person that invites them, who receives them cheerfully, and heartily bids them welcome: such a dinner, with such circumstances, is better <p>than a stalled ox, and hatred therewith; than an ox kept up in the stall for fattening; or than a fatted one, which with the ancients was the principal in a grand entertainment; hence the allusion in <a href="/matthew/22-4.htm">Matthew 22:4</a>. In the times of Homer, an ox was in high esteem at their festivals; at the feasts made by his heroes, Agamemnon, Menelaus, and Ajax, an ox was a principal part of them, if not the whole; the back of a fat ox, or a sirloin of beef, was a favourite dish (l). Indeed in some ages, both among Greeks and Romans, an ox was abstained from, through a superstitious regard to it, because so useful a creature in ploughing of the land; and it was carried so far as to suppose it to be as sinful to slay an ox as to kill a man (m): and Aratus (n) represents it as not done, neither in the golden nor silver age, but that in the brasen age men first began to kill and eat oxen; but this is to be confuted by the laws of God, <a href="/genesis/9-3.htm">Genesis 9:3</a>; and by the examples of Abraham and others. Now if there is hatred, either in the host, or in the guests among themselves, or in a family, it must stir up strifes and contentions, and render all enjoyments unpleasant and uncomfortable; see <a href="/proverbs/17-1.htm">Proverbs 17:1</a>; but where the love of God is, which is better than life, and the richest enjoyments of it; which sweetens every mercy, and cannot be purchased with money; and secures the best of blessings, the riches of grace and glory, and itself can never be lost; where this is, the meanest diet is preferable to the richest and most costly banquets of wicked men; who are hated and abhorred by the Lord, for their oppression and injustice, their luxury, or their covetousness; for poor men may be loved of God, and the rich be abhorred by him, <a href="/psalms/10-4.htm">Psalm 10:4</a>. <p>(i) Capteivei, <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/1.htm">Acts 1</a>.

The fat beef implies a sumptuous and magnificent entertainment; but such a feast is little worth if accompanied with feelings of hatred, jealousy, and ill will.

Instead of the biblical &#1488;&#1507; &#1499;&#1497;, the latter form of the language has &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1503; (all speaks for it that it is so), &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1495;&#1514; &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; &#1493;&#1499;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; (so much the more), &#1488;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493; &#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503;, or also &#1511;&#1500; &#1493;&#1495;&#1502;&#1512; (as minori ad majus  equals  quanto magis); vid., the Hebr. Rmerbrief, p. 14.)<p>&#1488;&#1489;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1503; has a meaning analogous to that of &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; (cf. &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd;, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_peter/2-4.htm">2 Peter 2:4</a>, to throw down into the &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;), which denotes the lowest region of Hades (&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1500; &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; or &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; '&#1513;&#1473;), and also in general, Hades. If &#1488;&#1489;&#1491;&#1493;&#1503; and &#1502;&#1493;&#1514; are connected, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/37-22.htm">Job 37:22</a>, and if &#1488;&#1489;&#1491;&#1493;&#1503; is the parallel word to &#1511;&#1489;&#1512;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/88-12.htm">Psalm 88:12</a>, or also to &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1500;, as in the passage similar to this proverb, <a href="/job/26-6.htm">Job 26:6</a> (cf. <a href="/job/38-17.htm">Job 38:17</a>): "Shel is naked before Him, and Abaddon has no covering;" since &#1488;&#1489;&#1491;&#1493;&#1503; is the general name of the underworld, including the grave, i.e., the inner place of the earth which receives the body of the dead, as the kingdom of the dead, lying deeper, does the soul. But where, as here and at <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/27-10.htm">Proverbs 27:10</a>, &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1500; and &#1488;&#1489;&#1491;&#1493;&#1503; stand together, they are related to each other, as &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#837;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; and &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; or &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, <a href="/revelation/9-11.htm">Revelation 9:11</a> : &#1488;&#1489;&#1491;&#1493;&#1503; is the lowest hell, the place of deepest descent, of uttermost destruction. The conclusion which is drawn in the proverb proceeds from the supposition that in the region of creation there is nothing more separated, and by a wide distance, from God, than the depth, and especially the undermost depth, of the realm of the dead. If now God has this region in its whole compass wide open before Him, if it is visible and thoroughly cognisable by Him (&#1504;&#1490;&#1491;, acc. adv.: in conspectu, from &#1504;&#1490;&#1491;, eminere, conspicuum esse) - for He is also present in the underworld, <a href="/psalms/139-8.htm">Psalm 139:8</a> - then much more will the hearts of the children of men be open, the inward thoughts of men living and acting on the earth being known already from their expressions. Man sees through man, and also himself, never perfectly; but the Lord can try the heart and prove the reins, <a href="/jeremiah/17-10.htm">Jeremiah 17:10</a>. What that means this proverb gives us to understand, for it places over against the hearts of men nothing less than the depths of the underworld in eternity.</body></html>
