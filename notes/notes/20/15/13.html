Or, a "joyful heart" (c); that is joyful in the God of its salvation; that rejoices in Christ Jesus; is filled with joy and peace through believing in him, in his person, blood, righteousness, and sacrifice; that has a comfortable view of his justification by his righteousness, of peace and pardon by his blood, of the atonement of his sins by his sacrifice; to whom he has said, "be of good cheer, thy sins are forgiven thee", <a href="/matthew/9-2.htm">Matthew 9:2</a>; who has peace in him, though tribulation in the world: as such a man's heart must be made glad, this will make his countenance cheerful, or cause him to lift up his head with joy; as it is in natural things, so it is in spiritual ones; <p>but by sorrow of the heart the spirit is broken; a man is dejected, his spirits sink, and it is seen in his countenance: there is a great sympathy between the body and mind, the one is much affected by the other; when the heart is full of sorrow, the animal spirits are low, the nerves are loosened, the whole frame, of nature is enfeebled, and the body emaciated; this is often the case through outward troubles (d): physicians say (e) that grief weakens the strength, and destroys the spirits, more than labour does. "The sorrow of the world worketh death", <a href="/2_corinthians/7-10.htm">2 Corinthians 7:10</a>; and sometimes, through spiritual troubles, a sense of sin and guilt of it, a legal sorrow, which produces a legal contrition of spirit; and such "a wounded spirit who can bear?" <a href="/proverbs/18-14.htm">Proverbs 18:14</a>. This is the effect of a mere work of the law upon the conscience; and stands opposed to the spiritual joy, and the effects of it, the Gospel brings. <p>(c)  "cor gaudens", V. L. Baynus.

But by sorrow of heart the spirit is broken (<a href="/proverbs/12-25.htm">Proverbs 12:25</a>). Happiness is shown in the outward look, but sorrow has a deeper and more abiding influence; it touches the inner life, destroys the natural elasticity, creates despondency and despair (comp. <a href="/proverbs/16-24.htm">Proverbs 16:24</a>; <a href="/proverbs/17-22.htm">Proverbs 17:22</a>). Corn. a Lapide quotes St. Gregory Nazianzen's definition - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Laetitia quidnam? Mentis est diffusio.<br />Tristitia? Cordis morsus et turbatio."</span> Hitzig and others translate the second clause, "But in sorrow of heart is the breath oppressed." It is doubtful if the words can be so rendered, and certainly the parallelism is not improved thereby. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>A second series which begins with a proverb of the power of human speech, and closes with proverbs of the advantages and disadvantages of wealth.<p><a href="/proverbs/15-7.htm">Proverbs 15:7</a><p>7 The lips of the wise spread knowledge;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; But the direction is wanting to the heart of fools.<p>It is impossible that &#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1499;&#1503; can be a second object. accus. dependent on &#1497;&#1494;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; (dispergunt, not &#1497;&#1510;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;, <a href="/proverbs/20-28.htm">Proverbs 20:28</a>; &#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;, as Symmachus translates): but the heart of fools is unrighteous (error or falsehood) (Hitzig after <a href="/isaiah/16-6.htm">Isaiah 16:6</a>); for then why were the lips of the wise and the heart of the fools mentioned? &#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1499;&#1503; also does not mean &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c7; &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2; (an old Greek anonymous translation, Jerome, Targ., Venet., Luther): the heart of the fool is quite different from the heart of the wise man, which spreads abroad knowledge (Zckler), for it is not heart and heart, but lip and heart, that are placed opposite to each other. Better the lxx &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2;, and yet better the Syr. lo kin&#305;&#770;n (not right, sure). We have seen, at <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/11-19.htm">Proverbs 11:19</a>, that &#1499;&#1503; as a participial adj. means standing  equals  being, continuing, or also standing erect  equals  right, i.e., rightly directed, or having the right direction; &#1499;&#1468;&#1503;&#1470;&#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1492; means there conducting oneself rightly, and thus genuine rectitude. What, after 7a, is more appropriate than to say of the heart of the fool, that it wants the receptivity for knowledge which the lips of the wise scatter abroad? The heart of the fool is not right, it has not the right direction, is crooked and perverse, has no mind for wisdom; and that which proceeds from the wise, therefore, finds with him neither estimation nor acceptance.</body></html>
