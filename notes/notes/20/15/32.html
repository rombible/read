God sets himself at a distance from those who set him at defiance. 30. How delightful to the humbled soul to hear the good report of salvation by the Lord Jesus Christ! 31. Faithful, friendly reproofs help spiritual life, and lead to eternal life. 32. Sinners undervalue their own souls; therefore they prefer the body before the soul, and wrong the soul to please the body. 33. The fear of the Lord will dispose us to search the Scriptures with reverence; and it will cause us to follow the leadings of the Holy Spirit.

Pers. merdi n&#305;&#770;ku, man of good  equals  good man), vid., Friedr. Philippi's Status Constr. p. 121. Thoughts which are of a bad kind and of a bad tendency, particularly (what the parallel member brings near) of a bad disposition and design against others, are an abomination to God; but, on the contrary, pure, viz., in His eyes, which cannot look upon iniquity (<a href="/habakkuk/1-13.htm">Habakkuk 1:13</a>), are the &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1470;&#1504;&#1506;&#1501;, words of compassion and of friendship toward men, which are (after 26a) the expression of such thoughts, thus sincere, benevolent words, the influence of which on the soul and body of him to whom they refer is described, <a href="/proverbs/16-24.htm">Proverbs 16:24</a>. The Syr., Targ., Symmachus, Theodotion, and the Venet. recognise in &#1493;&#1468;&#1496;&#1492;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; the pred., while, on the contrary, the lxx, Jerome, and Luther (who finally decided for the translation, "but the pure speak comfortably") regard it as subject. But that would be an attribution which exceeds the measure of possibility, and for which &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; or &#1491;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497; must be used; also the parallelism requires that &#1496;&#1492;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; correspond with '&#1514;&#1493;&#1506;&#1489;&#1514; &#1492;. Hence also the reference of &#1493;&#1496;&#1492;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; to the judgment of God, which is determined after the motive of pure untainted law; that which proceeds from such, that and that only, is pure, pure in His sight, and thus also pure in itself. </body></html>
