Secret sins, services, and sorrows, are under God's eye. This speaks comfort to saints, and terror to sinners. 4. A good tongue is healing to wounded consciences, by comforting them; to sin-sick souls, by convincing them; and it reconciles parties at variance. 5. If instruction is despised, reprove men rather than suffer them to go on undisturbed in the way to ruin. 6. The wealth of worldly men increases their fears and suspicions, adds strength to their passions, and renders the fear of death more distressing. 7. We use knowledge aright when we disperse it; but the heart of the foolish has nothing to disperse that is good. 8,9. The wicked put other things in the stead of Christ's atonement, or in the place of holy obedience. Praying graces are his gift, and the work of his Spirit, with which he is well pleased. 10.

God sometimes blesses the righteous with great riches, as he did Abraham; or, however, if they have but little, it is better than the riches of many wicked; because they have what they have with a blessing, and they are content with it: and they have abundance of spiritual treasure; they have God for their portion; Christ, and all good things along with him; the rich graces of the Spirit; a rich experience of the grace of God; and all this is but a pledge and earnest of what they shall possess hereafter; <p>but in the revenues of the wicked is trouble; they have much trouble in getting their riches, by which they pierce themselves through with many sorrows; they have much trouble in keeping them; cannot rest nor sleep because of their abundance, lest it should be taken away from them; and they have much trouble in parting with them, when they are, by one providence or another, stripped of them; and, besides, they have them with a curse, and are ever attended with uneasiness, on one account or another. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/15.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">In the house of the righteous <i>is</i> much treasure: but in the revenues of the wicked is <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> trouble.</span><p>(a) For though they have much yet it is full of trouble and care.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the house of the righteous is much treasure</span> (<span class="accented">chosen</span>; see on Proverbs 27:24). The good man's store is not wasted or wrongly used, and is blest by God: and therefore, whether absolutely much or little, it is safe, and it is sufficient.

The substantival clause 35a may mean: the king's favour has (possesses)..., as well as: it is imparted to, an intelligent servant; the arrangement of the words is more favourable to the latter rendering. In 35b the gender of the verb is determined by attraction after the pred., as is the case also at <a href="/genesis/31-8.htm">Genesis 31:8</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/15-31.htm">Job 15:31</a>, Ewald, 317c. And "his wrath" is equivalent to is the object of it, cf. 22b, <a href="/proverbs/13-18.htm">Proverbs 13:18</a>. The syntactical character of the clause does not permit the supplying of &#1500; from 35a. Luther's translation proceeds only apparently from this erroneous supposition. </body></html>
