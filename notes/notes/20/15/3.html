Secret sins, services, and sorrows, are under God's eye. This speaks comfort to saints, and terror to sinners. 4. A good tongue is healing to wounded consciences, by comforting them; to sin-sick souls, by convincing them; and it reconciles parties at variance. 5. If instruction is despised, reprove men rather than suffer them to go on undisturbed in the way to ruin. 6. The wealth of worldly men increases their fears and suspicions, adds strength to their passions, and renders the fear of death more distressing. 7. We use knowledge aright when we disperse it; but the heart of the foolish has nothing to disperse that is good. 8,9. The wicked put other things in the stead of Christ's atonement, or in the place of holy obedience. Praying graces are his gift, and the work of his Spirit, with which he is well pleased. 10.

By "evil" men may be meant both profane sinners and carnal professors; such as are more openly wicked, and declare their sin, as Sodom, or more secretly so; he sees into all the wickedness there is in their hearts, all their secret devices against his people; the works done by them in the dark, as well as their more open ones; and his eyes are upon all of them, to bring them into judgment at the last day: his eyes are particularly on the proud, to abase them; such as are under a disguise of religion, and have a form of godliness, he has his eyes upon; he sees through all their disguises; he knows on what foot they took up their profession; he discerns between that and true grace; he sees how they retain their lusts with their profession; observes the springs and progress of their apostasy; and will fix his eyes on the man without a righteousness, not having on the wedding garment, and order him into outer darkness. He also beholds "good" men; he sees all their bad things, their sins, and corrects them for them; their good things, their graces, and the exercise of them; their good works, the fruits of his own grace; their weaknesses, and supports and strengthens them; their wants, and supplies them; their persons, and never withdraws his eyes from them: these are on them continually, to protect and defend them; nor will he leave them till he has brought them safe to heaven; see <a href="/1_chronicles/16-9.htm">1 Chronicles 16:9</a>. <p>(u) "prospectantes velut a specula", Michaelis; "speculatores", Schultens; "speculantes", Montanus, Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator; "speculatur", Cocceius. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/15.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The eyes of the LORD are in every place, beholding the evil and the good.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/15.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">3</span>. <span class="ital">beholding</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">keeping watch upon</span>, R.V. <span class="greekheb">σκοπεύουσι</span>, LXX.

The lxx (and also the Syr., Targ., Jerome, and Venet.) prefers the former, but for the sake of producing an exact parallelism changes &#1489;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;&#1493; [in his death] into &#1489;&#1514;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493; [in his uprightness], reversing also the relation of the subject and the predicate: &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#837; &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3bf;&#788;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; (the Syr.: in this, that he has no sin; Targ.: when he dies) &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;. But no Scripture word commends in so contradictory a manner self-righteousness, for the verb &#1495;&#1505;&#1492; never denotes self-confidence, and with the exception of two passages (<a href="/judges/9-15.htm">Judges 9:15</a>; <a href="/isaiah/30-2.htm">Isaiah 30:2</a>), where it is connected with &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1500;, is everywhere the exclusive (vid., <a href="/psalms/118-8.htm">Psalm 118:8</a>.) designation of confidence resting itself in God, even without the '&#1489;&#1492;, as here as at <a href="/psalms/17-7.htm">Psalm 17:7</a>. The parallelism leads us to translate &#1489;&#1512;&#1506;&#1514;&#1493;, not on account of his wickedness, but with Luther, in conformity with &#1489;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;&#1493;, in his misfortune, i.e., if it befall him. Thus Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/23-12.htm">Jeremiah 23:12</a>) says of the sins of his people: &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1508;&#1500;&#1492; &#1497;&#1491;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;, in the deep darkness they are driven on (Niph. of &#1491;&#1495;&#1495;  equals  &#1491;&#1495;&#1492;), and <a href="/proverbs/24-16.htm">Proverbs 24:16</a> contains an exactly parallel thought: the godless stumble &#1489;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492;, into calamity. Ewald incorrectly: in his calamity the wicked is overthrown - for what purpose then the pronoun? The verb &#1491;&#1495;&#1492; frequently means, without any addition, "to stumble over heaps," e.g., <a href="/psalms/35-5.htm">Psalm 35:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/36-13.htm">Psalm 36:13</a>. The godless in his calamity is overthrown, or he fears in the evils which befall him the intimations of the final ruin; on the contrary, the righteous in his death, even in the midst of extremity, is comforted, viz., in God in whom he confides. Thus understood, Hitzig thinks that the proverb is not suitable for a time in which, as yet, men had not faith in immortality and in the resurrection. Yet though there was no such revelation then, still the pious in death put their confidence in Jahve, the God of life and of salvation - for in Jahve<p>(Note: Vid., my Bibl.-prophet. Theol. (1845), p. 268, cf. Bibl. Psychologie (1861), p. 410, and Psalmen (1867), p. 52f., and elsewhere.)<p>there was for ancient Israel the beginning, middle, and end of the work of salvation - and believing that they were going home to Him, committing their spirit into His hands (<a href="/psalms/31-6.htm">Psalm 31:6</a>), they fell asleep, though without any explicit knowledge, yet not without the hope of eternal life. Job also knew that (<a href="/job/27-8.htm">Job 27:8</a>.) between the death of those estranged from God and of those who feared God there was not only an external, but a deep essential distinction; and now the Chokma opens up a glimpse into the eternity heavenwards, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/15-24.htm">Proverbs 15:24</a>, and has formed, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/12-28.htm">Proverbs 12:28</a>, the expressive and distinctive word &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, for immortality, which breaks like a ray from the morning sun through the night of the Sheol. </body></html>
