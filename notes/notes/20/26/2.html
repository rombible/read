He that is cursed without cause, the curse shall do him no more harm than the bird that flies over his head. 3. Every creature must be dealt with according to its nature, but careless and profligate sinners never will be ruled by reason and persuasion. Man indeed is born like the wild ass's colt; but some, by the grace of God, are changed. 4,5. We are to fit our remarks to the man, and address them to his conscience, so as may best end the debate. 6-9. Fools are not fit to be trusted, nor to have any honour. Wise sayings, as a foolish man delivers and applies them, lose their usefulness. 10. This verse may either declare how the Lord, the Creator of all men, will deal with sinners according to their guilt, or, how the powerful among men should disgrace and punish the wicked. 11. The dog is a loathsome emblem of those sinners who return to their vices, 2Pe 2:22. 12. We see many a one who has some little sense, but is proud of it. This describes those who think their spiritual state to be good, when really it is very bad. 13. The slothful man hates every thing that requires care and labour. But it is foolish to frighten ourselves from real duties by fancied difficulties. This may be applied to a man slothful in the duties of religion. 14. Having seen the slothful man in fear of his work, here we find him in love with his ease. Bodily ease is the sad occasion of many spiritual diseases. He does not care to get forward with his business. Slothful professors turn thus. The world and the flesh are hinges on which they are hung; and though they move in a course of outward services, yet they are not the nearer to heaven. 15. The sluggard is now out of his bed, but he might have lain there, for any thing he is likely to bring to pass in his work. It is common for men who will not do their duty, to pretend they cannot. Those that are slothful in religion, will not be at the pains to feed their souls with the bread of life, nor to fetch in promised blessings by prayer. 16. He that takes pains in religion, knows he is working for a good Master, and that his labour shall not be in vain. 17. To make ourselves busy in other men's matters, is to thrust ourselves into temptation. 18,19. He that sins in jest, must repent in earnest, or his sin will be his ruin. 20-22. Contention heats the spirit, and puts families and societies into a flame. And that fire is commonly kindled and kept burning by whisperers and backbiters. 23. A wicked heart disguising itself, is like a potsherd covered with the dross of silver.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>i. e., "Vague as the flight of the sparrow, aimless as the wheelings of the swallow, is the causeless curse. It will never reach its goal." The marginal reading in the Hebrew, however, gives" to him" instead of "not" or "never;" i. e., "The causeless curse, though it may pass out of our ken, like a bird's track in the air, will come on the man who utters it."

As a bird, particularly the sparrow, as the word (h) is sometimes rendered, leaves its nest and wanders from it; and flies here and there, and settles nowhere; and as the swallow flies to the place from whence it came; or the wild pigeon, as some (i) think is meant, which flies away very swiftly: the swallow has its name in Hebrew from liberty, because it flies about boldly and freely, and makes its nest in houses, to which it goes and comes without fear; <p>so the curse causeless shall not come; the mouths of fools or wicked men are full of cursing and bitterness, and especially such who are advanced above others, and are set in high places; who think they have a right to swear at and curse those below them, and by this means to support their authority and power; but what signify their curses which are without a cause? they are vain and fruitless, like Shimei's cursing David; they fly away, as the above birds are said to do, and fly over the heads of those on whom they are designed to light; yea, return and fall upon the heads of those that curse, as the swallow goes to the place from whence it came; it being a bird of passage, <a href="/jeremiah/8-7.htm">Jeremiah 8:7</a>; in the winter it flies away and betakes itself to some islands on rocks called from thence "chelidonian" (k). According to the "Keri", or marginal reading, for here is a double reading, it may be rendered, "so the curse causeless shall come to him" (l); that gives it without any reason. The Septuagint takes in both, <p>"so a vain curse shall not come upon any;'' <p>what are all the anathemas of the church of Rome? who can curse whom God has not cursed? yea, such shall be cursed themselves; see <a href="/psalms/109-17.htm">Psalm 109:17</a>. <p>(h) "sicat passeris", Mercerus, Gejerus; "ut passer", Piscator; Schultens.

It may perhaps have been suggested by the idea that the subject of this verse—he who invokes the curse—would be “the fool,” as in the group of Proverbs , vv1-12 here.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/context/proverbs/26-3.htm" title="A whip for the horse, a bridle for the ass, and a rod for the fool's back...."><span class="ital">Proverbs 26:3-12</a></span><span class="bld">.</span> The proverbs of this group have all of them, as has <span class="ital"><a href="/proverbs/26-1.htm" title="As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, so honor is not seemly for a fool.">Proverbs 26:1</a></span> of the chapter, the “fool” for their subject.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As the bird by wandering, as the swallow by flying.</span> "Bird" (<span class="accented">tsippor</span>) is the sparrow, which is found throughout Palestine; "swallow" (<span class="accented">deror</span>), the free flier. The Authorized Version hardly gives the sense. The line should be rendered, <span class="accented">as</span> <span class="accented">the sparrow in</span> (in respect of) <span class="accented">its wandering</span>, <span class="accented">as the swallow in its flying</span>. The point of comparison is the vagueness and aimlessness of the birds' flight, or the uselessness of trying to catch them in their course. <span class="cmt_word">So the curse causeless shall not come.</span> It shall, as it were, spend its force in the air, and fall not on the head on which it was invoked. A causeless curse is that which is uttered against one who has done nothing to deserve such denunciation. Septuagint, "As birds and sparrows fly, so a causeless (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) curse shall come upon no one" (comp. <a href="/1_samuel/17-43.htm">1 Samuel 17:43</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/13-2.htm">Nehemiah 13:2</a>.) Bailey, 'Festus' - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Blessings star forth forever; but a curse<br />Is like a cloud - it passes."</span> Closely connected with the superstition that dreads a curse is that which is alarmed by omens. Against this irrational fear we find some Eastern proverbs directed; <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, "The jackal howls: will my old buffalo die?" "The dog barks - still the caravan passes: will the barking of the dog reach the skies?" (Lane). Instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5dc;&#x5ba;&#x5d0;</span>, "not," the Keri reads <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d5;</span>, "to him." This makes the proverb say that the unprovoked curse shall return upon him who uttered it. But this reading is not to be accepted, as it does not suit the terms of comparison, though it seems to have been used by St. Jerome, who translates, <span class="accented">Sic maledictum frustra prolatum in quempiam superveniet</span>. This retributive justice is often alluded to elsewhere; <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, ver. 27 (where see note). So we find in various languages proverbs to the same effect. Thus in English, "Harm watch, harm catch;" Spanish, "Who sows thorns, let him not walk barefoot;" Turkish, "Curses, like chickens, always come home to roost;" Yoruba, "Ashes always fly back in the face of him that throws them" (Trench). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/25.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>24 Better to sit on the top of a roof,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Than a quarrelsome woman and a house in common.<p>A repetition of <a href="/proverbs/21-9.htm">Proverbs 21:9</a>. </body></html>
