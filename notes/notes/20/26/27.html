What pains men take to do mischief to others! but it is digging a pit, it is rolling a stone, hard work; and they prepare mischief to themselves. 28. There are two sorts of lies equally detestable.

That devises mischief against others, it shall come upon himself. The allusion is to the digging of pits for catching wild beasts, which are slightly covered with earth; and which sometimes the pursuers, through inadvertency, fall into themselves; the passage seems to be taken from <a href="/psalms/7-15.htm">Psalm 7:15</a>; <p>and he that rolleth a stone, it will return upon him; that rolls a stone up hill, if he does not take care, it will return back, and fall with great force upon himself; so the mischief which a wicked man labours hard at, as men do in digging a pit, or rolling a stone, in time rolls back upon themselves; the measure they mete out to others is measured to them. Jarchi makes mention of an "hagadah", or exposition, which illustrates this passage, by the case of Abimelech; who slew threescore and ten persons on one stone, and was himself killed with a piece of a millstone cast upon him, <a href="/judges/9-18.htm">Judges 9:18</a>; this may put in mind of the fable of Sisyphus (o), feigned in hell to roll a great stone to the top of a mountain, which presently falling down on his head, made his labour fruitless. <p>(o) "Aut petis aut urges ruitum, Sisyphe, saxum", Ovid.

St. Chrysostom speaks of the blindness of malice: "Let us not plot against others, lest we injure ourselves. When we supplant the reputation of others, let us consider that we injure ourselves, it is against ourselves that we plot. For perchance with men we do him harm, if we have power, but ourselves in the sight of God, by provoking him against us. Let us not, then, injure ourselves. For as we injure ourselves when we injure our neighbours, so by benefiting them we benefit ourselves" ('Hom. 14, in Phil.,' Oxford transl.). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/26.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>21 Black coal to burning coal, and wood to fire;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And a contentious man to stir up strife.<p>The Venet. translates &#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1501; by &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b2;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bd;, and &#1490;&#1468;&#1495;&#1500;&#1514; by &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3be;; the former (from &#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1501;, Arab. fah&#803;uma, to be deep black) is coal in itself; the latter (from &#1490;&#1468;&#1495;&#1500;, jaham, to set on fire, and intrans. to burn), coal in a glowing state (e.g., <a href="/proverbs/25-22.htm">Proverbs 25:22</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/1-13.htm">Ezekiel 1:13</a>).
