Always distrust when a man speaks fair unless you know him well. Satan, in his temptations, speaks fair, as he did to Eve; but it is madness to give credit to him. 27. What pains men take to do mischief to others! but it is digging a pit, it is rolling a stone, hard work; and they prepare mischief to themselves. 28. There are two sorts of lies equally detestable. A slandering lie, the mischief of this every body sees. A flattering lie, which secretly works ruin.

He that bears a grudge in his mind, and retains hatred in his heart against any person, hides it all he can, till he has an opportunity of showing it as he would; he pretends a great deal of friendship with his lips, that his hatred might not be known; he would be thought to be a friend, when he is really an enemy; he does not choose as yet to make himself known what he is. Some render it to a sense the reverse, "the enemy", or "he that hateth, is known by his lips" (l); so the Targum, Vulgate Latin, and Syriac versions: if you carefully watch him, mark his words, and observe what he says, you will find out the hatred that lies in his heart; he cannot forbear saying something, at one time or another, which betrays the malignity of his mind; <p>and layeth up deceit within him; or, "though (m) he layeth up", &amp;c. hides it as much as he can, yet it will show itself in some way or another. <p>(l) "agnoscetur", Montanus, Vatablus; "cognoscetur", Tigurine version; "cognoscitur", Amama, so Luther.

St. Jerome, <span class="accented">Labiis suis intelligitur inimicus</span>. But the verb here used, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5db;&#x5e8;</span>, bears the meaning "to make one's self unknown," as well as "to make one's self known," and hence "to make one's self unrecognizable" by dress or change of countenance (<a href="/1_kings/14-5.htm">1 Kings 14:5</a>). This is much more appropriate in the present connection than the other explanation. The man cloaks his hatred with honeyed words. <span class="cmt_word">And layeth</span>  <span class="cmt_word">up deceit within him;</span> meditating all the time treachery in his heart (<a href="/jeremiah/9-8.htm">Jeremiah 9:8</a>). Septuagint, "An enemy weeping promises all things with his lips, but in his heart he contriveth deceits." The tears in this case are hypocritical signs of sorrow, intended to deceive the dupe. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/26.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>These verses form a tetrastich:<p>18 As a man who casteth brands,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And arrows, and death;<p>19 So is the man who deceiveth his neighbour,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And saith: I only make sport.<p>The old translations of &#1502;&#1514;&#1500;&#1492;&#1500;&#1492; are very diverse. Aquila has rendered it by &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;; Symmachus: &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;; the Syr.: the vainglorious; the Targ.: &#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514; (from &#1504;&#1495;&#1514;), a successor (spiritually); Jerome: noxius (injurious; for which Luther: secret). There is thus no traditional translation. Kimchi explains the word by &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1490;&#1506; (Venet. &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c2;); Aben Ezra by &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1496;&#1492; (from &#1513;&#1474;&#1496;&#1492;), to behave thoughtlessly, foolishly; but both erroneously, confounding with it &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;&#1468;, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/47-13.htm">Genesis 47:13</a>, which is formed from &#1500;&#1492;&#1492; and not from &#1500;&#1492;&#1492;&#1468;, and is related to &#1500;&#1488;&#1492;, according to which &#1502;&#1514;&#1500;&#1492;&#1500;&#1492; would designate him who exerts himself (Rashi, &#1492;&#1502;&#1514;&#1497;&#1490;&#1506;), or who is worn out (Saadia: who does not know what to do, and in weariness passes his time). The root &#1500;&#1492;&#1492;&#1468; (&#1500;&#1492;&#1468;), whence the reflex form &#1492;&#1514;&#1500;&#1492;&#1500;&#1492;&#1468;, like &#1492;&#1514;&#1502;&#1492;&#1502;&#1492;&#1468;, from &#1502;&#1492;&#1492;&#1468;, &#1502;&#1492;&#1468;) leads to another primary idea. The root &#1500;&#1492;&#1468; presents in (Arab.) a&#770;liha (vid., Fleischer in the Comm. zur Genesis, p. 57), waliha, and taliha, formed from the 8th form of this verb (aittalah), the fundamental meaning of internal and external unrest; these verbs are used of the effect of fear (shrinking back from fear), and, generally, the want of self-command; the Syr. otlahlah, to be terrified, obstupescere, confirms this primary conception, connecting itself with the R. &#1500;&#1492;&#1468;. Accordingly, he who shoots every possible death-bringing arrow, is thought of as one who is beside himself, one who is of confused mind, in which sense the passive forms of (Arab.) a&#770;lah and talah are actually used. Schultens' reference to (Arab.) la&#770;h micare, according to which &#1499;&#1502;&#1514;&#1500;&#1492;&#1500;&#1492; must mean sicut ludicram micationem exercens (Bttcher: one who exerts himself; Malbim: one who scoffs, from &#1492;&#1514;&#1500;), is to be rejected, because &#1502;&#1514;&#1500;&#1492;&#1500;&#1492; must be the direct opposite of &#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1495;&#1511;; and Ewald's comparison of (Arab.) wa&#770;h and akhkh, to be entangled, distorted, la&#770;h, to be veiled, confounds together heterogeneous words. Regarding &#1494;&#1511;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; (from &#1494;&#1504;&#1511;), burning arrows, vid., under <a href="/isaiah/50-11.htm">Isaiah 50:11</a>. Death stands third, not as comprehensive (that which is deadly of every kind), but as a climax (yea, even death itself). The &#1499;&#1468;&#1503; of the principal sentence, correlate to &#1499;&#1468; of the contiguous clause, has the Makkeph in our editions; but the laws of the metrical Makkeph require &#1499;&#1468;&#1503; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; (with Munach), as it occurs e.g., in Cod. 1294. A man who gives vent to his malice against his neighbour, and then says: seest thou not that... (&#1492;&#1500;&#1488;, like Arab. a&#770;la&#770;), i.e., I am only jesting, I have only a joke with thee: he exhibits himself as being mad, who in blind rage scatters about him deadly arrows. </body></html>
