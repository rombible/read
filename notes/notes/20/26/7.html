He that is cursed without cause, the curse shall do him no more harm than the bird that flies over his head. 3. Every creature must be dealt with according to its nature, but careless and profligate sinners never will be ruled by reason and persuasion. Man indeed is born like the wild ass's colt; but some, by the grace of God, are changed. 4,5. We are to fit our remarks to the man, and address them to his conscience, so as may best end the debate. 6-9. Fools are not fit to be trusted, nor to have any honour. Wise sayings, as a foolish man delivers and applies them, lose their usefulness. 10. This verse may either declare how the Lord, the Creator of all men, will deal with sinners according to their guilt, or, how the powerful among men should disgrace and punish the wicked. 11. The dog is a loathsome emblem of those sinners who return to their vices, 2Pe 2:22. 12. We see many a one who has some little sense, but is proud of it. This describes those who think their spiritual state to be good, when really it is very bad. 13. The slothful man hates every thing that requires care and labour. But it is foolish to frighten ourselves from real duties by fancied difficulties. This may be applied to a man slothful in the duties of religion. 14. Having seen the slothful man in fear of his work, here we find him in love with his ease. Bodily ease is the sad occasion of many spiritual diseases. He does not care to get forward with his business. Slothful professors turn thus. The world and the flesh are hinges on which they are hung; and though they move in a course of outward services, yet they are not the nearer to heaven. 15. The sluggard is now out of his bed, but he might have lain there, for any thing he is likely to bring to pass in his work. It is common for men who will not do their duty, to pretend they cannot. Those that are slothful in religion, will not be at the pains to feed their souls with the bread of life, nor to fetch in promised blessings by prayer. 16. He that takes pains in religion, knows he is working for a good Master, and that his labour shall not be in vain. 17. To make ourselves busy in other men's matters, is to thrust ourselves into temptation. 18,19. He that sins in jest, must repent in earnest, or his sin will be his ruin. 20-22. Contention heats the spirit, and puts families and societies into a flame. And that fire is commonly kindled and kept burning by whisperers and backbiters. 23. A wicked heart disguising itself, is like a potsherd covered with the dross of silver.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Or, Take away the legs of the lame man, and the parable that is in the mouth of fools: both are alike useless to their possessors.

The first word of this verse, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>, has occasioned some difficulty. It is considered as an imperative from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5dc;&#x5d4;</span>, "draw off," "take away." Thus the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>; Venetian, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>. But the verb seems never to have this meaning; nor, if it had, would the sense be very satisfactory, for. as Delitzsch points out, lame legs are better than none, and there is a great difference between the perfectly crippled or paralytic who has to be carried, and the lame man (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b4;&#x5e1;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;</span>) who can limp or get along on crutches., And when we explain the proverb in this sense (as Plumptre), "Take away the legs of the lame man and the parable from the mouth of fools," for both alike ere useless to their possessors, and their loss would not be felt - we must recognize that the conclusion is not true. No one would think of amputating s man's legs simply because he was lame, and such a one's legs cannot be considered absolutely useless. Others regard the word as third plural kal, "the legs hang loose;" though the form is not sufficiently accounted for. All explanations of the word as a verbal form have such difficulties, that some take it as a noun, meaning "dancing," which is Luther's interpretation, "as dancing to a cripple, so it becometh a fool to talk of wisdom." But the word could never sightly anything but "limping," and could not express the elegant motion of dancing. The Authorized Version considers the Hebrew to mean, "are lifted up," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. are unequal, one being longer or stronger than the other; but this loses the force of the comparison. There seems to be no better interpretation than that mentioned above," The legs of the lame hang loose," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. are unserviceable, however sound in appearance. St. Jerome has expressed this, though in a strange fashion, "As it is vain for a lame man to have seemly legs." <span class="cmt_word">So is a parable in the mouth of a fool.</span> "Parable" (<span class="accented">mashal</span>), sententious saying, the enunciation of which, as well as the recital of stories, was always a great feature in Eastern companies, and afforded a test of a man's ability. A fool fails in the exhibition; he misses the point of the wise saying which he produces; it falls lame from his mouth, affords no instruction to others, and makes no way with its hearers. Siracides gives another reason for the incongruity, "A parable shall be rejected when it cometh out of a fool's mouth; for he will not speak it in its season" (Ecclus. 20:20). Septuagint, "Take away the motion of legs, and transgression (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>,? <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, Lag.) from the mouth of fools." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/26.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>There now follows a group of eleven proverbs of the fool; only the first of the group has after it a proverb of different contents, but of similar form:<p>As snow in summer, and rain in harvest;<p>So honour befitteth not a fool.<p>If there is snow in high summer (&#1511;&#1497;&#1509;, to be glowing hot), it is contrary to nature; and if there is rain in harvest, it is (according to the alternations of the weather in Palestine) contrary to what is usually the case, and is a hindrance to the ingathering of the fruits of the field. Even so a fool and respect, or a place of honour, are incongruous things; honour will only injure him (as according to <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/19-10.htm">Proverbs 19:10</a>, luxury); he will make unjust use of it, and draw false conclusions from it; it will strengthen him in his folly, and only increase it. &#1504;&#1488;&#1493;&#1492; ( equals  &#1504;&#1488;&#1493;&#1497;) is the adj. to the Pil. &#1504;&#1488;&#1493;&#1492;, <a href="/psalms/93-5.htm">Psalm 93:5</a> (plur. &#1504;&#1488;&#1493;&#1493;&#1468;); &#1504;&#1488;&#1493;&#1492;, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/19-10.htm">Proverbs 19:10</a>, and &#1504;&#1488;&#1493;&#1492;, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/17-7.htm">Proverbs 17:7</a>, are also masc. and fem. of the adj., according to which, that which is said under <a href="/proverbs/19-10.htm">Proverbs 19:10</a> is to be corrected.
