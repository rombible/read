He that is cursed without cause, the curse shall do him no more harm than the bird that flies over his head. 3. Every creature must be dealt with according to its nature, but careless and profligate sinners never will be ruled by reason and persuasion. Man indeed is born like the wild ass's colt; but some, by the grace of God, are changed. 4,5. We are to fit our remarks to the man, and address them to his conscience, so as may best end the debate. 6-9. Fools are not fit to be trusted, nor to have any honour. Wise sayings, as a foolish man delivers and applies them, lose their usefulness. 10. This verse may either declare how the Lord, the Creator of all men, will deal with sinners according to their guilt, or, how the powerful among men should disgrace and punish the wicked. 11. The dog is a loathsome emblem of those sinners who return to their vices, 2Pe 2:22. 12. We see many a one who has some little sense, but is proud of it. This describes those who think their spiritual state to be good, when really it is very bad. 13. The slothful man hates every thing that requires care and labour. But it is foolish to frighten ourselves from real duties by fancied difficulties. This may be applied to a man slothful in the duties of religion. 14. Having seen the slothful man in fear of his work, here we find him in love with his ease. Bodily ease is the sad occasion of many spiritual diseases. He does not care to get forward with his business. Slothful professors turn thus. The world and the flesh are hinges on which they are hung; and though they move in a course of outward services, yet they are not the nearer to heaven. 15. The sluggard is now out of his bed, but he might have lain there, for any thing he is likely to bring to pass in his work. It is common for men who will not do their duty, to pretend they cannot. Those that are slothful in religion, will not be at the pains to feed their souls with the bread of life, nor to fetch in promised blessings by prayer. 16. He that takes pains in religion, knows he is working for a good Master, and that his labour shall not be in vain. 17. To make ourselves busy in other men's matters, is to thrust ourselves into temptation. 18,19. He that sins in jest, must repent in earnest, or his sin will be his ruin. 20-22. Contention heats the spirit, and puts families and societies into a flame. And that fire is commonly kindled and kept burning by whisperers and backbiters. 23. A wicked heart disguising itself, is like a potsherd covered with the dross of silver.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Grieveth him - Better, wearieth him. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/26.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15.

To keep it warm; Jarchi's note is, <p>"he puts his hand in a hot basin, because of the cold.'' <p>The word (c) for "bosom" does sometimes signify a "pot" or basin. Or he hides it under his "arm holes", as some render it, not caring to make use of it for labour; or covers it out of sight in his bosom, pretending some weakness or ailment in it, which hinders him from working; see <a href="/proverbs/19-24.htm">Proverbs 19:24</a>; <p>it grieveth him to bring it again to his mouth; from under his arm holes, or out of his bosom, or even out of the platter, where his food is; an hyperbolical expression, setting forth his excessive sloth; and such an one ought not to eat, but starve indeed. It may be rendered, "he is weary"; it is a "weariness" (d) to him; it is even a labour too much for him to feed himself, so great is his sloth: and such is the sloth of carnal men; it is a weariness to them to hear the word, and attend on ordinances, and to lift up their hands in prayer to God; or to make use of any means, that they may have food for their souls; praying, hearing, and reading, are a burden to them; and therefore it is but just with God to send them a famine of the word, and take away the whole stay and staff of bread and water. <p>(c) "in patina vel olla", Vatablus; "in patinam", Tigurine version; "lebete", Mercerus; "in paropside", Cocceius; "in paropsidem", Schultens.

The lxx, Syr. (Targ.?), and Jerome interpret &#1506;&#1500;&#1492; in the sense of shooting up, i.e., of growing; Bttcher also, after <a href="/proverbs/24-31.htm">Proverbs 24:31</a> and other passages, insists that the thorn which has shot up may be one that has not grown to perfection, and therefore not dangerous. But thorns grow not in the hand of any one; and one also does not perceive why the poet should speak of it as growing in the hand of a drunken man, which the use of the hand with it would only make worse. We have here &#1506;&#1500;&#1492; &#1489;&#1497;&#1491;&#1497;, i.e., it has come into my hand, commonly used in the Mishna, which is used where anything, according to intention, falls into one's hands, as well as where it comes accidentally and unsought for, e.g., Nazir 23a, &#1502;&#1497; &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1514;&#1499;&#1493;&#1493;&#1503; &#1500;&#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514; &#1489;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493; &#1489;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512; &#1495;&#1494;&#1497;&#1512; &#1493;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492; &#1489;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493; &#1489;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512; &#1496;&#1500;&#1492;, he who designs to obtain swine's flesh and (accidentally) obtains lamb's flesh. Thus rightly Heidenheim, Lwenstein, and the Venet.: &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b1; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3b7; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c1;&#x3b1; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;. &#1495;&#1493;&#1495; signifies a thorn bush, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/14-9.htm">2 Kings 14:9</a>,<p>(Note: The plur. &#1495;&#1493;&#1495;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-6.htm">1 Samuel 13:6</a>, signifies not thorn bushes, but rock-splitting; in Damascus, cho&#770;cha means a little gate in the wing of a large door; vid., Wetstein's Nordarabien, p. 23.)<p>as well as a thorn, Sol 2:2, but where not the thorns of the rose, and indeed no rose at all, is meant. Luther thinks of the rose with the thorn when he explains: "When a drunkard carries and brandishes in his hand a thorn bush, he scratches more with it than allows the roses to be smelled - so a fool with the Scriptures, or a right saying, often does more harm than good." This paraphrase of Luther's interprets &#1506;&#1500;&#1492; &#1489;&#1497;&#1491; more correctly than his translation does; on the other hand, the latter more correctly is satisfied with a thorn twig (as a thorn twig which pierces into the hand of a drunken man); the roses are, however, assumed contrary to the text. This holds good also against Wessely's explanation: "the Mashal is like a rose not without thorns, but in the mouth of a fool is like a thorn without a rose, as when a drunken man seeks to pluck roses and gains by his effort nothing but being pierced by thorns." The idea of roses is to be rejected, because at the time when this proverb was formed there were no roses in Palestine. The proverb certainly means that a right Mashal, i.e., an ingenious excellent maxim, is something more and better than a &#1495;&#1493;&#1495; (the prick as of the Jewish thorn, Zizyphus vulgaris, or the Christus-thorn, the Ziz spina Christi); but in the mouth of a fool such a maxim becomes only a useless and a hurtful thing; for the fool so makes use of it, that he only embarrasses others and recklessly does injury to them. The lxx translates &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500; by &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;, and the Aram. by &#1513;&#1473;&#1496;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1488;; how the latter reached this "folly" is not apparent; but the lxx vocalized &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;, according to which Hitzig, at the same time changing &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512; into &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, translates: "thorns shoot up by the hand of the hireling, and tyranny by the mouth of fools." Although a hired labourer, yet, on this account, he is not devoid of conscience; thus 9a so corrected has something in its favour: one ought, as far as possible, to do all with his own hand; but the thought in 9b is far-fetched, and if Hitzig explains that want of judgment in the state councils creates despotism, so, on the other hand, <a href="/proverbs/24-7.htm">Proverbs 24:7</a> says that the fool cannot give counsel in the gate, and therefore he holds his mouth. </body></html>
