He that is cursed without cause, the curse shall do him no more harm than the bird that flies over his head. 3. Every creature must be dealt with according to its nature, but careless and profligate sinners never will be ruled by reason and persuasion. Man indeed is born like the wild ass's colt; but some, by the grace of God, are changed. 4,5. We are to fit our remarks to the man, and address them to his conscience, so as may best end the debate. 6-9. Fools are not fit to be trusted, nor to have any honour. Wise sayings, as a foolish man delivers and applies them, lose their usefulness. 10. This verse may either declare how the Lord, the Creator of all men, will deal with sinners according to their guilt, or, how the powerful among men should disgrace and punish the wicked. 11. The dog is a loathsome emblem of those sinners who return to their vices, 2Pe 2:22. 12. We see many a one who has some little sense, but is proud of it. This describes those who think their spiritual state to be good, when really it is very bad. 13. The slothful man hates every thing that requires care and labour. But it is foolish to frighten ourselves from real duties by fancied difficulties. This may be applied to a man slothful in the duties of religion. 14. Having seen the slothful man in fear of his work, here we find him in love with his ease. Bodily ease is the sad occasion of many spiritual diseases. He does not care to get forward with his business. Slothful professors turn thus. The world and the flesh are hinges on which they are hung; and though they move in a course of outward services, yet they are not the nearer to heaven. 15. The sluggard is now out of his bed, but he might have lain there, for any thing he is likely to bring to pass in his work. It is common for men who will not do their duty, to pretend they cannot. Those that are slothful in religion, will not be at the pains to feed their souls with the bread of life, nor to fetch in promised blessings by prayer. 16. He that takes pains in religion, knows he is working for a good Master, and that his labour shall not be in vain. 17. To make ourselves busy in other men's matters, is to thrust ourselves into temptation. 18,19. He that sins in jest, must repent in earnest, or his sin will be his ruin. 20-22. Contention heats the spirit, and puts families and societies into a flame. And that fire is commonly kindled and kept burning by whisperers and backbiters. 23. A wicked heart disguising itself, is like a potsherd covered with the dross of silver.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Two sides of a truth.

Our blessed Saviour never responded to foolish and captious questions in the way that the questioner hoped and desired, he put them by or gave an unexpected turn to them which silenced the adversary.

Thus e.g., Fleischer: as a troubled ruined spring is a misfortune for the people who drink out of it, or draw from it, so is it a misfortune for the surrounding of the righteous, when he is driven from his dwelling or his possession by an unrighteous man. And it is true: the righteous can be compared to a well (&#1502;&#1506;&#1497;&#1503;, well-spring, from &#1506;&#1497;&#1503;, a well, as an eye of the earth, and &#1502;&#1511;&#1493;&#1512;, fountain, from &#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, R. &#1511;&#1512;, &#1499;&#1512;, to round out, to dig out), with reference to the blessing which flows from it to its surroundings (cf. <a href="/proverbs/10-11.htm">Proverbs 10:11</a> and <a href="/john/7-38.htm">John 7:38</a>). But the words "yielding to" (contrast "stood before," <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/10-4.htm">2 Kings 10:4</a>, or <a href="/joshua/7-12.htm">Joshua 7:12</a>), in the phrase "yielding to the godless," may be understood of a spontaneous as well as of a constrained, forced, wavering and yielding, as the expression in the Psalm &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1496; [non movebor, <a href="/psalms/10-6.htm">Psalm 10:6</a>] affirms the certainty of being neither inwardly nor outwardly ever moved or shaken. The righteous shall stand fast and strong in God without fearing the godless (<a href="/isaiah/51-12.htm">Isaiah 51:12</a>.), unmoveable and firm as a brazen wall (<a href="/jeremiah/1-17.htm">Jeremiah 1:17</a>.). If, however, he is wearied with resistance, and from the fear of man, or the desire to please man, or from a false love of peace he yields before it, and so gives way - then he becomes like to a troubled fountain (&#1512;&#1508;&#1513;&#1474;, cogn. &#1512;&#1502;&#1505;, <a href="/ezekiel/34-18.htm">Ezekiel 34:18</a>; <a href="/isaiah/41-25.htm">Isaiah 41:25</a>; Jerome: fans turbatus pede), a ruined spring; his character, hitherto pure, is now corrupted by his own guilt, and now far from being a blessing to others, his wavering is a cause of sorrow to the righteous, and an offence to the weak - he is useful no longer, but only injurious. Rightly Lagarde: "The verse, one of the most profound of the whole book, does not speak of the misfortunate, but of the fall of the righteous, whose sin compromises the holy cause which he serves, <a href="/2_samuel/12-14.htm">2 Samuel 12:14</a>." Thus also e.g., Lwenstein, with reference to the proverb Sanhedrin 92b: also in the time of danger let not a man disown his honour. Bachja, in his Ethics, referring to this figure, 26a, thinks of the possibility of restoration: the righteous wavers only for the moment, but at last he comes right (&#1502;&#1514;&#1502;&#1493;&#1496;&#1496; &#1493;&#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492;). But this interpretation of the figure destroys the point of the proverb. </body></html>
