(Comp. <a href="/proverbs/3-2.htm" title="For length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add to you.">Proverbs 3:2</a>.)<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:1-12 Christ has prepared ordinances to which his people are admitted, and by which nourishment is given here to those that believe in him, as well as mansions in heaven hereafter. The ministers of the gospel go forth to invite the guests. The call is general, and shuts out none that do not shut out themselves. Our Saviour came, not to call the righteous, but sinners; not the wise in their own eyes, who say they see. We must keep from the company and foolish pleasures of the ungodly, or we never can enjoy the pleasures of a holy life. It is vain to seek the company of wicked men in the hope of doing them good; we are far more likely to be corrupted by them. It is not enough to forsake the foolish, we must join those that walk in wisdom. There is no true wisdom but in the way of religion, no true life but in the end of that way. Here is the happiness of those that embrace it. A man cannot be profitable to God; it is for our own good. Observe the shame and ruin of those who slight it. God is not the Author of sin: and Satan can only tempt, he cannot force. Thou shalt bear the loss of that which thou scornest: it will add to thy condemnation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The holy - The word in the Hebrew is plural, agreeing, probably, with &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501;  'eloh&#305;&#770;ym understood (so in <a href="/proverbs/30-3.htm">Proverbs 30:3</a>).

These are the words of Wisdom, and contain a reason and argument why her call and advice in the preceding verses should be listened unto, since she gives long life to her followers. She is a tree of life unto them, the author and giver of spiritual and eternal life; by means of her bread and her wine spiritual life is maintained, promoted, and preserved; and length of days, for ever and ever, is the gift of her right hand; see <a href="/proverbs/3-16.htm">Proverbs 3:16</a>. The Targum is, <p>"for by it thy days shall be multiplied;'' <p>which seems to refer it to the fear of the Lord, the beginning of wisdom, in <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>, to which long life is attributed; see <a href="/proverbs/10-27.htm">Proverbs 10:27</a>; <p>and the years of thy life shall be increased; or, "they shall add years of life to thee" (o); wisdom and understanding, the fear of the Lord, and the knowledge of the Holy; if not in this world, yet in the world to come, which will be without end. <p>(o)    "et addent tibi annos vitae", Baynus, Cocceius. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For by me thy days shall be multiplied, and the years of thy life shall be increased.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - The parenthetical explanation being concluded, in which Wisdom has intimated why it is useless to appeal to the scorner and the wilful sinner, she now resumes the direct address interrupted at ver. 7, presenting a forcible reason for the advice given in ver. 6, though there is still some connection with ver. 10, as it is from the wisdom that comes from the fear of the Lord that the blessings now mentioned spring. <span class="cmt_word">For by me thy days shall be multiplied</span> (see <a href="/proverbs/3-2.htm">Proverbs 3:2, 16</a>; <a href="/proverbs/4-10.htm">Proverbs 4:10</a>, where long life is promised as a reward for the possession and practice of wisdom). The same result is attributed to the fear of God (<a href="/proverbs/10-27.htm">Proverbs 10:27</a>; <a href="/proverbs/14-27.htm">Proverbs 14:27</a>, etc.). In ver. 6 the address is in the plural; here it is singular.

The &#1489;&#1468; after &#1500;&#1495;&#1501; and &#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1492; proceeds neither from the idea of eating into (hewing into) anything, nor from the eating with anything, i.e., inasmuch as one makes use of it, nor of pampering oneself with anything (as &#1512;&#1488;&#1492; &#1489;); Michaelis at last makes a right decision (cf. <a href="/leviticus/22-11.htm">Leviticus 22:11</a>; <a href="/judges/13-16.htm">Judges 13:16</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/21-25.htm">Job 21:25</a>, and particularly &#1500;&#1495;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;, <a href="/psalms/141-4.htm">Psalm 141:4</a>): communicationem et participationem in re fruenda denotat; the lxx &#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;.

That Wisdom, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/9-2.htm">Proverbs 9:2</a>, offers flesh and wine, but here presents bread and wine, is no contradiction, which would lead us, with Hitzig, critically to reject <a href="/proverbs/9-4.htm">Proverbs 9:4</a> and <a href="/proverbs/9-5.htm">Proverbs 9:5</a> as spurious; &#1500;&#1495;&#1501; is the most common, all-comprehensive name for nourishment.
