But Solomon may also be considered as showing us, in these verses, whom he meant by the foolish, <a href="/proverbs/9-6.htm" title="Forsake the foolish, and live; and go in the way of understanding.">Proverbs 9:6</a>, even scorners and wicked men; and here he presses the advice last given of forsaking them, because there was no good, but hurt, to be got from them.

The ministers of the gospel go forth to invite the guests. The call is general, and shuts out none that do not shut out themselves. Our Saviour came, not to call the righteous, but sinners; not the wise in their own eyes, who say they see. We must keep from the company and foolish pleasures of the ungodly, or we never can enjoy the pleasures of a holy life. It is vain to seek the company of wicked men in the hope of doing them good; we are far more likely to be corrupted by them. It is not enough to forsake the foolish, we must join those that walk in wisdom. There is no true wisdom but in the way of religion, no true life but in the end of that way. Here is the happiness of those that embrace it. A man cannot be profitable to God; it is for our own good. Observe the shame and ruin of those who slight it. God is not the Author of sin: and Satan can only tempt, he cannot force.

Intimating, that though the simple, and such as want understanding, and of whom there is hope of doing them good, are to be invited into Wisdom's house; yet not the haughty scorner, the abandoned sinner, the scoffer at all religion, who walks after his own lusts, and is quite irreclaimable; it is but casting pearls before swine, and giving that which is holy to dogs, to reprove and exhort such persons; though the Gospel is to be preached to every creature, yet when men despise it, and make a mock at it, they are to be turned from, and no more is to be said to them; as the Jews of old, they were the first invited to the Gospel feast, the same that is described in the context; they made light of it, contradicted and blasphemed the word, and so judged themselves unworthy of it; wherefore Wisdom's maidens, or Christ's ministers, were bid to turn from them, and go to the Gentiles, and preach it to them; for it is to no purpose to address such persons; "shame" is the sure consequence of it, because a man is disappointed of the end he has in view, which is doing good; <p>and he that rebuketh a wicked man getteth himself a blot; this shows who is meant by a scorner, a very profligate man, bent on his wicked ways, and quite incorrigible; to rebuke such an one is not only labour lost, and in vain, but the rebuker getteth himself an ill name, and is sure to have the dirt of reproach and scandal cast upon him; though this a man might patiently bear, if there was any hope of doing good. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">He that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame: and he that rebuketh a wicked <i>man getteth</i> himself a <span class="cverse3">{g}</span> blot.</span><p>(g) For the wicked will contemn him and labour to defame him.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/9.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">7</span>. <span class="ital">shame … a blot</span>] because his failure convicts him of unwisdom in the attempt.

There is some abruptness in the introduction of these verses, which seem to interrupt the even flow of the invitation given by Wisdom. The majority of commentators regard them as the justification offered by Wisdom of her own course, in confining her invitation to the simple, and not extending it to the scorner and the wicked. This explanation, however, leaves us still to enquire why any such justification should here be called for. But if the cry “forsake” (<span class="ital"><a href="/proverbs/9-6.htm" title="Forsake the foolish, and live; and go in the way of understanding.">Proverbs 9:6</a></span>), be as it were the key-note of the appeal, then these verses shew cause alike why Wisdom should not reprove the scorners herself, and why the simple should not linger in their company in the delusive hope of winning them with themselves to Wisdom.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7-10.</span> - These verses form a parenthesis, showing why Wisdom addresses only the simple and foolish. She giveth not that which is holy unto dogs, nor casteth pearls before swine (<a href="/matthew/7-6.htm">Matthew 7:6</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame.</span> He who tries to correct a scorner (see on Proverbs 1:22 and Proverbs 3:34), one who derides religion, loses his pains and meets with ribald mockery and insult. It is not the fault of messengers or message that this should be, but the hardness of heart and the pride of the hearer make him despise the teaching and hate the teacher (<a href="/matthew/24-9.htm">Matthew 24:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He that rebuketh a wicked man getteth himself a blot;</span> rather, <span class="accented">he that reproveth a sinner, it is his blot.</span> Such a proceeding results in disgrace to himself. This is not said to discourage the virtuous from reproving transgressors, but states the effect which experience proves to occur in such cases. Prudence, caution, and tact are needed in dealing with these characters. Evil men regard the reprover as a personal enemy, and treat him with contumely, and hence arise unseemly bickerings and disputes, injurious words and deeds. To have wasted teaching on such unreceptive and antagonistic natures is a shameful expenditure of power. St. Gregory thus explains this matter: "It generally happens that when they cannot defend the evils that are reproved in them, they are rendered worse from a feeling of shame, and carry themselves so high in their defence of themselves, that they take out bad points to urge against the life of the reprover, and so they do not account themselves guilty, if they fasten guilty deeds upon the heads of others also. And when they are unable to find true ones, they feign them, that they may also themselves have things they may seem to rebuke with no inferior degree of justice" ('Moral.,' 10:3, Oxford transl.). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The preceding discourse pronounces those happy who, having taken their stand at the portal of Wisdom, wait for her appearance and her invitation. There is thus a house of Wisdom as there is a house of God, <a href="/psalms/84-11.htm">Psalm 84:11</a>; and if now the discourse is of a house of Wisdom, and of an invitation to a banquet therein (like that in the parable, <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/22.htm">Matthew 22</a>, of the invitation to the marriage feast of the king's son), it is not given without preparation:<p>1 Wisdom hath builded for herself an house,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Hewn out her seven pillars;<p>2 Hath slaughtered her beasts, mingled her wine;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Hath also spread her table;<p>3 Hath sent out her maidens; she waiteth<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; On the highest points of the city.<p><a href="/proverbs/9-1.htm">Proverbs 9:1</a><p>Regarding &#1495;&#1499;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, vid., at <a href="/proverbs/1-20.htm">Proverbs 1:20</a>. It is a plur. excellentiae, which is a variety of the plur. extensivus. Because it is the expression of a plural unity, it stands connected (as for the most part also &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501;, Deus) with the sing. of the predicate. The perfects enumerate all that Wisdom has done to prepare for her invitation. If we had a parable before us, the perf. would have run into the historical &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495;; but it is, as the &#1514;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488; shows, an allegorical picture of the arrangement and carrying out of a present reality. Instead of &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1514;&#1492; &#1500;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; there is &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1514;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1492;&#1468;, for the house is already in its origin represented as hers, and 1b is to be translated: she has hewn out her seven pillars (Hitzig); more correctly: her pillars, viz., seven (after the scheme &#1491;&#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1501; &#1512;&#1506;&#1492;, <a href="/genesis/37-2.htm">Genesis 37:2</a>); but the construction is closer. &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506;&#1492; is, altogether like <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/25-37.htm">Exodus 25:37</a>, the accusative of the second object, or of the predicate after the species of verba, with the idea: to make something, turn into something, which take to themselves a double accusative, Gesen. 139, 2: excidit columnas suas ita ut septem essent. Since the figure is allegorical, we may not dispense with the interpretation of the number seven by the remark, "No emphasis lies in the number" (Bertheau). First, we must contemplate architecturally the house with seven pillars: "They are," as Hitzig rightly remarks, "the pillars of the &#1502;&#1505;&#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1503; (porch) [vid. Bachmann under <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/3-23.htm">Judges 3:23</a>, and Wetstein under <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/144-12.htm">Psalm 144:12</a>, where &#1495;&#1496;&#1489; is used of the cutting out and hewing of wood, as &#1495;&#1510;&#1489; of the cutting out and hewing of stone] in the inner court, which bore up the gallery of the first (and second) floors: four of these in the corners and three in the middle of three sides; through the midst of these the way led into the court of the house-floor the area." But we cannot agree with Hitzig in maintaining that, with the seven pillars of chap. 8 and 9, the author looks back to the first seven chapters (Arab. a&#770;bwab, gates) of this book; we think otherwise of the component members of this Introduction to the Book of Proverbs; and to call the sections of a book "gates, &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;," is a late Arabico-Jewish custom, of which there is found no trace whatever in the O.T. To regard them also, with Heidenheim (cf. Dante's Prose Writings, translated by Streckfuss, p. 77), as representing the seven liberal arts (&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506; &#1495;&#1499;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;) is impracticable; for this division of the artes liberales into seven, consisting of the Trivium (Grammar, Rhetoric, and Dialectics) and Quadrivium (Music, Arithmetic, Geometry, and Astronomy), is not to be looked for within the old Israelitish territory, and besides, these were the sciences of this world which were so divided; but wisdom, to which the discourse here refers, is wholly a religious-moral subject. The Midrash thinks of the seven heavens (&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506;&#1492; &#1512;&#1511;&#1497;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501;), or the seven climates or parts of the earth (&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506;&#1492; &#1488;&#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1514;), as represented by them; but both references require artificial combinations, and have, as also the reference to the seven church-eras (Vitringa and Chr. Ben. Michaelis), this against them, that they are rendered probable neither from these introductory proverbial discourses, nor generally from the O.T. writings. The patristic and middle-age reference to the seven sacraments of the church passes sentence against itself; but the old interpretation is on the right path, when it suggests that the seven pillars are the seven gifts of the Holy Ghost. The seven-foldness of the manifestation of the Spirit, already brought near by the seven lamps of the sacred candelabra (the &#1502;&#1504;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492;), is established by <a href="/isaiah/11-2.htm">Isaiah 11:2</a> (vid., l.c.); and that Wisdom is the possessor and dispenser of the Spirit she herself testifies, <a href="/proverbs/1-23.htm">Proverbs 1:23</a>. Her Spirit is the "Spirit of wisdom;" but at the same time, since, born of God, she is mediatrix between God and the world, also the "Spirit of Jahve," He is the "spirit of understanding," the "spirit of counsel," and the "spirit of might" (<a href="/isaiah/11-2.htm">Isaiah 11:2</a>); for she says, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/8-14.htm">Proverbs 8:14</a>, "Counsel is mine, and reflection; I am understanding, I have strength." He is also the "spirit of knowledge," and the "spirit of the fear of the Lord" (<a href="/isaiah/11-2.htm">Isaiah 11:2</a>); for fear and the knowledge of Jahve are, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/9-14.htm">Proverbs 9:14</a>, the beginning of wisdom, and essentially wisdom itself.</body></html>
