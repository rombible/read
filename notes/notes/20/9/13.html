Carnal, sensual pleasure, stupifies conscience, and puts out the sparks of conviction. This tempter has no solid reason to offer; and where she gets dominion in a soul, all knowledge of holy things is lost and forgotten. She is very violent and pressing. We need to seek and pray for true wisdom, for Satan has many ways to withdraw our souls from Christ. Not only worldly lusts and abandoned seducers prove fatal to the souls of men; but false teachers, with doctrines that flatter pride and give liberty to lusts, destroy thousands. They especially draw off such as have received only partial serious impressions. The depths of Satan are depths of hell; and sin, without remorse, is ruin, ruin without remedy. Solomon shows the hook; those that believe him, will not meddle with the bait. Behold the wretched, empty, unsatisfying, deceitful, and stolen pleasure sin proposes; and may our souls be so desirous of the everlasting enjoyment of Christ, that on earth we may live to him, daily, by faith, and ere long be with him in glory.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The picture of the harlot as the representative of the sensual life, the Folly between which and Wisdom the young man has to make his choice (<a href="/proverbs/9-3.htm">Proverbs 9:3</a> note).

Joseph: &#1492;&#1508;&#1512;&#1491;&#1493; &#1502;&#1503; &#1492;&#1508;&#1514;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501;); but his remark, that, under the term "simple," mockers and wicked persons are comprehended as belonging to the same category, confounds two sharply distinguished classes of men. &#1500;&#1509; is the freethinker who mocks at religion and virtue (vid., <a href="/proverbs/1-22.htm">Proverbs 1:22</a>), and &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; the godless who shuns restraint by God and gives himself up to the unbridled impulse to evil. The course of thought in <a href="/proverbs/9-7.htm">Proverbs 9:7</a> and onwards shows why Wisdom, turning from the wise, who already are hers, directs herself only to the simple, and those who are devoid of understanding: she must pass over the &#1500;&#1509; and &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; dna , because she can there hope for no receptivity for her invitation; she would, contrary to <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/7-6.htm">Matthew 7:6</a>, "give that which is holy to the dogs, and cast her pearls before swine." &#1497;&#1505;&#1512;, &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; (with the prevailing idea of the bitter lesson of reproof and punishment), and &#1492;&#1493;&#1499;&#1497;&#1495;, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, are interchangeable conceptions, <a href="/psalms/94-10.htm">Psalm 94:10</a>; the &#1500; is here exponent of the object (to bring an accusation against any one), as <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/9-8.htm">Proverbs 9:8</a>, <a href="/proverbs/15-12.htm">Proverbs 15:12</a> (otherwise as <a href="/isaiah/2-4.htm">Isaiah 2:4</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/11-4.htm">Isaiah 11:4</a>, where it is the dat. commodi: to bring unrighteousness to light, in favour of the injured). &#1497;&#1505;&#1512; &#1500;&#1509; is pointed with Mahpach of the penultima, and thus with the tone thrown back. The Pasek, placed in some editions between the two words, is masoretically inaccurate. He who reads the moral to the mocker brings disgrace to himself; the incorrigible replies to the goodwill with insult. Similar to the &#1500;&#1511;&#1495; &#1500;&#1493; here, is &#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; tollit  equals  reportat, <a href="/proverbs/3-25.htm">Proverbs 3:25</a>; <a href="/proverbs/4-27.htm">Proverbs 4:27</a>.

But &#1502;&#1493;&#1502;&#1493; does not also subordinate itself to &#1500;&#1511;&#1495; as to the object. parallel &#1511;&#1500;&#1493;&#1503;: maculam sibimet scil. acquirit; for, to be so understood, the author ought at least to have written &#1500;&#1493; &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;. Much rather &#1502;&#1493;&#1502;&#1493; is here, as at <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-5.htm">Deuteronomy 32:5</a>, appos., thus pred. (Hitzig), without needing anything to be supplied: his blot it is, viz., this proceeding, which is equivalent to &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1488; &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; &#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1468; (Targ.), opprobrio ipsi est. Zckler not incorrectly compares <a href="/psalms/115-7.htm">Psalm 115:7</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-16.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:16</a>, but the expression (macula ejus  equals  ipsi) lies here less remote from our form of expression. In other words: Whoever correcteth the mockers has only to expect hatred (&#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1514;&#1493;&#1499;&#1495; with the tone thrown back, according to rule; cf. on the contrary, <a href="/judges/18-25.htm">Judges 18:25</a>), but on the other hand, love from the wise.</body></html>
