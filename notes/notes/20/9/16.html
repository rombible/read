Carnal, sensual pleasure, stupifies conscience, and puts out the sparks of conviction. This tempter has no solid reason to offer; and where she gets dominion in a soul, all knowledge of holy things is lost and forgotten. She is very violent and pressing. We need to seek and pray for true wisdom, for Satan has many ways to withdraw our souls from Christ. Not only worldly lusts and abandoned seducers prove fatal to the souls of men; but false teachers, with doctrines that flatter pride and give liberty to lusts, destroy thousands. They especially draw off such as have received only partial serious impressions. The depths of Satan are depths of hell; and sin, without remorse, is ruin, ruin without remedy. Solomon shows the hook; those that believe him, will not meddle with the bait. Behold the wretched, empty, unsatisfying, deceitful, and stolen pleasure sin proposes; and may our souls be so desirous of the everlasting enjoyment of Christ, that on earth we may live to him, daily, by faith, and ere long be with him in glory.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Contrast with <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/9-1.htm">Proverbs 9:1</a>, etc. The foolish woman has her house, but it is no stately palace with seven pillars, like the home of Wisdom.

The latter had addressed the simple because they were inexperienced and undecided, and might be guided aright; the former now speaks to them because they have not vet made their final choice, can still be swayed by lower considerations, and may be led astray. Such persons find it hard to distinguish between the good and the evil, the false and the true, especially when their sensual appetite is aroused and sides with the temptress. No marvel is it that such are easily deceived; for we are told that, under certain circumstances, Satan transforms himself into an angel of light (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-14.htm">2 Corinthians 11:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That wanteth understanding.</span> This is the other class addressed by Wisdom, and which Folly now solicits, urging them to follow her on the path of pleasure, promising sensual enjoyment and security. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>These words naturally follow:<p>10 "The beginning of wisdom is the fear of Jahve,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the knowledge of the Holy One is understanding."<p>This is the highest principle of the Chokma, which stands (<a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>) as a motto at the beginning of the Book of Proverbs.
