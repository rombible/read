Carnal, sensual pleasure, stupifies conscience, and puts out the sparks of conviction. This tempter has no solid reason to offer; and where she gets dominion in a soul, all knowledge of holy things is lost and forgotten. She is very violent and pressing. We need to seek and pray for true wisdom, for Satan has many ways to withdraw our souls from Christ. Not only worldly lusts and abandoned seducers prove fatal to the souls of men; but false teachers, with doctrines that flatter pride and give liberty to lusts, destroy thousands. They especially draw off such as have received only partial serious impressions. The depths of Satan are depths of hell; and sin, without remorse, is ruin, ruin without remedy. Solomon shows the hook; those that believe him, will not meddle with the bait. Behold the wretched, empty, unsatisfying, deceitful, and stolen pleasure sin proposes; and may our souls be so desirous of the everlasting enjoyment of Christ, that on earth we may live to him, daily, by faith, and ere long be with him in glory.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Contrast with <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/9-1.htm">Proverbs 9:1</a>, etc. The foolish woman has her house, but it is no stately palace with seven pillars, like the home of Wisdom. No train of maidens wait on her, and invite her guests, but she herself sits at the door, her position as prominent as that of Wisdom, counterfeiting her voice, making the same offer to the same class (compare <a href="/proverbs/9-16.htm">Proverbs 9:16</a> with <a href="/proverbs/9-4.htm">Proverbs 9:4</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15, 16. to allure those who are right-minded, and who are addressed as in Pr 9:4, as<p>simple&#8212;that is, easily led (Pr 1:4) and unsettled, though willing to do right.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/proverbs/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Who were going innocently and directly about their business without any unchaste design; for others needed none of those invitations or offers, but went to her of their own accord.

These she has her eye upon as they pass along, and calls unto them, and endeavours to turn them aside out of the way they are going, to make them proselytes to her antichristian religion; which, when she succeeds in, she glories and boasts of; just as harlots are very desirous of seducing and debauching chaste, innocent, and virtuous persons; see <a href="/revelation/2-20.htm">Revelation 2:20</a>.

As they walk in the path of right and duty, she tries to turn them aside. Septuagint, "Calling to herself (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>) those that pass by and are keeping straight in their ways." The Fathers find here a picture of the seductions of heretical teaching, which puts on the mask of orthodoxy and deceives the unwary. Wordsworth notes that, in the Apocalypse, the false teacher bears some emblems of the Lamb (<a href="/revelation/13-11.htm">Revelation 13:11</a>). All false doctrine retains some element of truth, and it is because of this admixture that it procures adherents and thrives for a time. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>If anything is to be supplied to &#1514;&#1468;&#1503;, it is &#1500;&#1511;&#1495; (<a href="/proverbs/4-2.htm">Proverbs 4:2</a>); but &#1514;&#1503;, tradere, &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, is of itself correlat. of &#1500;&#1511;&#1495;, accipere (post-bibl. &#1511;&#1489;&#1468;&#1500;), &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, e.g., <a href="/galatians/1-9.htm">Galatians 1:9</a>. &#1492;&#1493;&#1491;&#1497;&#1506; &#1500;  equals  to communicate knowledge, &#1491;&#1506;&#1514;, follows the analogy of &#1492;&#1493;&#1499;&#1497;&#1495; &#1500;, to impart instruction, &#1514;&#1493;&#1499;&#1495;&#1514;.

She is humble; for, without self-will and self-sufficiency, she makes God's will her highest and absolutely binding rule (<a href="/proverbs/3-7.htm">Proverbs 3:7</a>). </body></html>
