From this it appears that it is to rulers and judges that the proverb primarily, though not necessarily exclusively, applies. In <a href="/proverbs/17-15.htm" title="He that justifies the wicked, and he that comdemns the just, even they both are abomination to the LORD.">Proverbs 17:15</a> the divine, as here the human, estimate of such conduct is affirmed.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that saith unto the wicked, Thou art righteous.</span> The judge is supposed to be acquitting a guilty person. <span class="cmt_word">Him shall the people curse.</span> The Hebrew is "peoples," as Septuagint and Vulgate, <span class="accented">maledicient eis populi</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Nations shall abhor him.</span> Not individuals, nor families only, but the whole community, wherever such an iniquitous ruler is found, shall execrate and hate him. The voice of the people is universally against him; no one is so blind and degraded as openly to applaud his nets. The verb <span class="accented">nakab</span>, "to curse," means primarily "to bore or pierce;" hence some have translated it here, "him shall the peoples stab." But the word is used in the sense of distinguishing by a mark or brand, and thence passes into the sense of cursing, as at <a href="/proverbs/11-26.htm">Proverbs 11:26</a>; <a href="/leviticus/24-11.htm">Leviticus 24:11</a>; <a href="/job/3-8.htm">Job 3:8</a>.

Niph. and Hiph., which in Niph. occurs only once with the initial guttural (as &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1496;&#1507;) or half guttural (&#1500;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;). &#1512;&#1506;&#1493; is not adj. here as at <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-3.htm">1 Samuel 25:3</a>, but perf. with the force of a fut. (Symmachus: &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#837; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;). The proverb extends the duty of love even to an enemy; for it requires that we do good to him and not evil, and warns against rejoicing when evil befalls him. Hitzig, indeed, supposes that the noble morality which is expressed in <a href="/proverbs/24-17.htm">Proverbs 24:17</a> is limited to a moderate extent by the motive assigned in 18b. Certainly the poet means to say that God could easily give a gracious turn for the better, as to the punishment of the wicked, to the decree of his anger against his enemy; but his meaning is not this, that one, from joy at the misfortune of others, ought to desist from interrupting the process of the destruction of his enemy, and let it go on to its end; but much rather, that one ought to abstain from this joy, so as not to experience the manifestation of God's displeasure thereat, but His granting grace to him against whom we rejoice to see God's anger go forth.<p>(Note: This proverb, according to Aboth iv. 24, was the motto of that Samuel with the surname &#1492;&#1511;&#1496;&#1503;, who formulated &#1489;&#1512;&#1499;&#1514; &#1492;&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; (the interpolation in the Schemone-Esre prayer directed against the schismatics): he thus distinguished between private enemies and the enemies of the truth.) </body></html>
