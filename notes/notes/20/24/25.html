This anger at the apparently unrighteous division of fortune, this jealousy at the success in which the godless rejoice, rest on short-sightedness, which regards the present, and looks not on to the end. &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514;, merely as in the expression '&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1488;&#1495;, 14b (cf. <a href="/psalms/37-37.htm">Psalm 37:37</a>), always denotes the happy, glorious issue indemnifying for past sufferings. Such an issue the wicked man has not; his light burns brightly on this side, but one day it is extinguished. In 20b is repeated <a href="/proverbs/13-9.htm">Proverbs 13:9</a>; cf. <a href="/proverbs/20-20.htm">Proverbs 20:20</a>. </body></html>
