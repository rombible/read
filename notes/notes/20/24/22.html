Otherwise, we must give another signification to <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5e0;&#x5d9;&#x5d4;&#x5dd;</span>, and, with the Syriac and many modern commentators, take it in the sense of "years," which <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5d4;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;</span> will bear, as <a href="/job/36-11.htm">Job 36:11</a>, and translate, "The destruction [equivalent to 'end'] of their years, who knoweth?" No one can tell when the crisis of their fate shall come; but it will arrive some day, and then the time of their prosperity will be at an end. Septuagint, "For they (God and the king) will suddenly punish the ungodly; and who shall know the vengeance of both (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>)?" After this the LXX. inserts three proverbs not found now in the Hebrew, which, however, Ewald ('Jahrb. der Bibl. Wissensch.,' 11:17, etc.) considers to have been translated from a Hebrew original: "A son that keepeth the commandment shall be safe from destruction (<a href="/proverbs/29-27.htm">Proverbs 29:27</a>, Vulgate), and he hath fully received it (the word). Let no lie be spoken by the tongue of the king; and no he shall proceed from his tongue. The king's tongue is a sword, and not of flesh; and whosoever shall be delivered unto it shall be destroyed; for if his anger be inflamed, he consumes men with their nerves, and devours men's bones, and burns them up as a flame, so that they are not food for the young eagles." The allusion at the end is to animals killed by lightning. Here follows the series of proverbs (<a href="/proverbs/30-1.htm">Proverbs 30:1-14</a>) called in the Hebrew, "The words of Agur." The second part of "the words of Agur," and "the words of Lemuel" (<a href="/proverbs/30-15.htm">Proverbs 30:15-31:9</a>) follow in the Greek after <a href="/proverbs/24-34.htm">Proverbs 24:34</a> of the Hebrew. Delitzsch explains the matter thus: In the copy from which the Alexandrines translated, the appendix (<a href="/proverbs/30.htm">Proverbs 30-31:9</a>) was divided into two parts, half of it standing after "the words of the wise" (<a href="/proverbs/22-17.htm">Proverbs 22:17-24:22</a>), and half after the supplement containing further sayings of wise men (<a href="/proverbs/24-23.htm">Proverbs 24:23-34</a>).  <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/24.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>15 Lie not in wait, oh wicked man, against the dwelling of the righteous;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Assault not his resting-place.<p>16 For seven times doth the righteous fall and rise again,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the wicked are overthrown when calamity falls on them.<p>The &#1488;&#1512;&#1489; [lying in wait] and &#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1468;&#1491; [practising violence], against which the warning is here given, are not directed, as at <a href="/proverbs/1-11.htm">Proverbs 1:11</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/19-26.htm">Proverbs 19:26</a>, immediately against the person, but against the dwelling-place and resting-place (&#1512;&#1489;&#1509;, e.g., <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-6.htm">Jeremiah 50:6</a>, as also &#1504;&#1493;&#1492;, 3:33) of the righteous, who, on his part, does injustice and wrong to no one; the warning is against coveting his house, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/20-17.htm">Exodus 20:17</a>, and driving him by cunning and violence out of it. Instead of &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;, Symmachus and Jerome have incorrectly read &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; daer, and from this misunderstanding have here introduced a sense without sense into <a href="/proverbs/24-15.htm">Proverbs 24:15</a>; many interpreters (Lwenstein, Ewald, Elster, and Zckler) translate with Luther appositionally: as a wicked man, i.e., "with mischievous intent," like one stealthily lurking for the opportunity of taking possession of the dwelling of another, as if this could be done with a good intent: &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; is the vocative (Syr., Targ., Venet.: &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c2;), and this address (cf. <a href="/psalms/75-5.htm">Psalm 75:5</a>.) sharpens the warning, for it names him who acts in this manner by the right name. The reason, 16a, sounds like an echo of <a href="/job/5-19.htm">Job 5:19</a>. &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506; signifies, as at <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/119-164.htm">Psalm 119:164</a>, seven times; cf. &#1502;&#1488;&#1492;, <a href="/proverbs/17-10.htm">Proverbs 17:10</a>. &#1493;&#1511;&#1501; (not &#1493;&#1511;&#1501;) is perf. consec., as &#1493;&#1495;&#1497;, e.g., <a href="/genesis/3-22.htm">Genesis 3:22</a> : and he rises afterwards (notwithstanding), but the transgressors come to ruin; &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492;, if a misfortune befall them (cf. <a href="/proverbs/14-32.htm">Proverbs 14:32</a>), they stumble and fall, and rise no more. </body></html>
