But in both a commencement is made with two lines, which contain, in the former, the principal thought; in this here, its reason:<p>13 My son, eat honey, for it is good,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And honeycomb is sweet to thy taste.<p>14 So apprehend wisdom for thy soul;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When thou hast found it, there is a future,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And thy hope is not destroyed.<p>After its nearest fundamental thought, &#1496;&#1493;&#1489;, Arab. t&#803;ejjib, means that which smells and tastes well; honey (&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473;, from &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473;, to be thick, consistent) has, besides, according to the old idea (e.g., in the Koran), healing virtue, as in general bitterness is viewed as a property of the poisonous, and sweetness that of the wholesome. &#1504;&#1508;&#1514;&#1493; is second accus. dependent on &#1488;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;, for honey and honeycomb were then spoken of as different; &#1504;&#1508;&#1514; (from &#1504;&#1508;&#1514;, to pour, to flow out) is the purest honey (virgin-honey), flowing of itself out of the comb. With right the accentuation takes 13b as independent, the substantival clause containing the reason, "for it is good:" honeycomb is sweet to thy taste, i.e., applying itself to it with the impression of sweetness; &#1506;&#1500;, as at <a href="/nehemiah/2-5.htm">Nehemiah 2:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/16-6.htm">Psalm 16:6</a> (Hitzig).<p>In the &#1499;&#1468;&#1503; of 14a, it is manifest that <a href="/proverbs/24-13.htm">Proverbs 24:13</a> is not spoken for its own sake. To apprehend wisdom, is elsewhere equivalent to, to receive it into the mind, <a href="/proverbs/1-2.htm">Proverbs 1:2</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/1-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:17</a> (cf. &#1491;&#1506;&#1514; &#1489;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492;, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/4-1.htm">Proverbs 4:1</a>, and frequently), according to which Bttcher also here explains: learn to understand wisdom. But &#1499;&#1503; unfolds itself in 14bc: even as honey has for the body, so wisdom has for the soul, beneficent wholesome effects. &#1491;&#1506;&#1492; &#1495;&#1499;&#1502;&#1492; is thus not absolute, but is meant in relation to these effects. Rightly Fleischer: talem reputa; Ewald: sic (talem) scito spaientiam (esse) animae tuae, know, recognise wisdom as something advantageous to thy soul, and worthy of commendation. Incorrectly Hitzig explains &#1488;&#1501;&#1470;&#1502;&#1510;&#1488;&#1514;, "if the opportunity presents itself." Apart from this, that in such a case the words would rather have been &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1514;&#1502;&#1510;&#1488;, to find wisdom is always equivalent to, to obtain it, to make it one's own, <a href="/proverbs/3-13.htm">Proverbs 3:13</a>; <a href="/proverbs/8-35.htm">Proverbs 8:35</a>; cf. <a href="/proverbs/2-5.htm">Proverbs 2:5</a>; <a href="/proverbs/8-9.htm">Proverbs 8:9</a>. &#1491;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492;<p>(Note: Write &#1491;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492; with Illuj after the preceding Legarmeh, like 12b, &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; (Thorath Emeth, p. 28).)<p>stands for &#1491;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492;, after the form &#1512;&#1491;&#1492;; &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1492; (after Bttcher, 396, not without the influence of the following commencing sound), cf. the similar transitions of a&#772; into e&#780; placed together at <a href="/psalms/20-4.htm">Psalm 20:4</a>; the form &#1491;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492; is also found, but &#1491;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492; is the form in the Cod. Hilleli,<p>(Note: Vid., Strack's Prolegomena critica in V.T. (1872), p. 19.)<p>as confirmed by Moses Kimchi in Comm., and by David Kimchi, Michlol 101b. With &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493; begins the apodosis (lxx, Jerome, Targ., Luther, Rashi, Ewald, and others). In itself, &#1493;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; (cf. <a href="/genesis/47-6.htm">Genesis 47:6</a>) might also continue the conditional clause; but the explanation, si inveneris (eam) et ad postremum ventum erit (Fleischer, Bertheau, Zckler), has this against it, that &#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; does not mean: the end comes, but: there is an end, <a href="/proverbs/23-18.htm">Proverbs 23:18</a>; cf. <a href="/proverbs/19-18.htm">Proverbs 19:18</a>; here: there is an end for thee, viz., an issue that is a blessed reward. The promise is the same as at <a href="/proverbs/23-18.htm">Proverbs 23:18</a>. In our own language we speak of the hope of one being cut off; (Arab.) jaz'a, to be cut off, is equivalent to, to give oneself up to despair. </body></html>
