But it seems more probable that this short preface is only and simply intended to signify that the proverbs or counsels here following, no less than those before mentioned, are worthy of the consideration and fit for the use of those who are or would be wise; or, that they belong to the wise and virtuous conduct of life. <span class="ital">It is not good to have respect of persons in judgment — </span>This is the first of these counsels; which expresses that it is a very evil thing for judges to determine controversies by partiality, according to the quality of the persons, and not according to the merits of the cause. <span class="ital">He that saith unto the wicked — </span>Namely, publicly and in judgment; <span class="ital">Thou art righteous — </span>That is, he that justifies wicked men in their unrighteous practices; <span class="ital">nations shall abhor him</span> — Partly for the grossness and odiousness of the crime; and partly for the great and general mischief which such proceedings bring on civil societies. <span class="ital">But to them that rebuke him — </span>That publicly and judicially rebuke and condemn the wicked; <span class="ital">shall be delight — </span>The peace of a good conscience; <span class="ital">and a good blessing shall come upon them — </span>Which the people shall wish, and by their prayers obtain from God for them.

The following proverbs, as well as the preceding, are derived from wise men. Mistaking this superscription, the LXX. makes it a personal address: "This I say to you who are wise, so that ye may learn." The first line is not a proverb, but the introduction to the ensuing collection. <span class="cmt_word">It is not good to have respect of persons in judgment</span> (see <a href="/proverbs/18-5.htm">Proverbs 18:5</a>, and note there; and <a href="/proverbs/28-21.htm">Proverbs 28:21</a>, where the expression is the same as here). To regard one person before another is to be partial and unjust. To say this error is "not good" is a meiosis, the meaning being that it is very evil and sinful (comp. <a href="/proverbs/20-23.htm">Proverbs 20:23</a>). The statement is developed and confirmed in the next two verses, which show the results of partiality and its opposite. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/24.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Warning against a vindictive disposition, and joy over its satisfaction.<p>17 At the fall of thine enemy rejoice not,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And at his overthrow let not thine heart be glad;<p>18 That Jahve see it not, and it be displeasing to Him,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And He turns away His anger from Him.<p>The Cheth&#305;&#770;b, which in itself, as the plur. of category, &#1488;&#1493;&#1497;&#1489;&#1497;&#1498;, might be tolerable, has 17b against it: with right, all interpreters adhere to the Ker&#305;&#770; &#1488;&#1493;&#1497;&#1489;&#1498; (with i from e&#772; in doubled close syllable, as in the like Ker&#305;&#770;, <a href="/1_samuel/24-5.htm">1 Samuel 24:5</a>). &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;, for &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;, is the syncope usual in the inf. Niph. and Hiph., which in Niph. occurs only once with the initial guttural (as &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1496;&#1507;) or half guttural (&#1500;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;). &#1512;&#1506;&#1493; is not adj. here as at <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-3.htm">1 Samuel 25:3</a>, but perf. with the force of a fut. (Symmachus: &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#837; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;). The proverb extends the duty of love even to an enemy; for it requires that we do good to him and not evil, and warns against rejoicing when evil befalls him. Hitzig, indeed, supposes that the noble morality which is expressed in <a href="/proverbs/24-17.htm">Proverbs 24:17</a> is limited to a moderate extent by the motive assigned in 18b. Certainly the poet means to say that God could easily give a gracious turn for the better, as to the punishment of the wicked, to the decree of his anger against his enemy; but his meaning is not this, that one, from joy at the misfortune of others, ought to desist from interrupting the process of the destruction of his enemy, and let it go on to its end; but much rather, that one ought to abstain from this joy, so as not to experience the manifestation of God's displeasure thereat, but His granting grace to him against whom we rejoice to see God's anger go forth.<p>(Note: This proverb, according to Aboth iv. 24, was the motto of that Samuel with the surname &#1492;&#1511;&#1496;&#1503;, who formulated &#1489;&#1512;&#1499;&#1514; &#1492;&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; (the interpolation in the Schemone-Esre prayer directed against the schismatics): he thus distinguished between private enemies and the enemies of the truth.) </body></html>
