And let not a desire ever come into thy mind, Oh that I could shake off restraints! 3-6. Piety and prudence in outward affairs, both go together to complete a wise man. By knowledge the soul is filled with the graces and comforts of the spirit, those precious and pleasant riches. The spirit is strengthened for the spiritual work and the spiritual warfare, by true wisdom. 7-9. A weak man thinks wisdom is too high for him, therefore he will take no pains for it. It is bad to do evil, but worse to devise it. Even the first risings of sin in the heart are sin, and must be repented of. Those that strive to make others hateful, make themselves so. 10. Under troubles we are apt to despair of relief. But be of good courage, and God shall strengthen thy heart. 11,12. If a man know that his neighbour is in danger by any unjust proceeding, he is bound to do all in his power to deliver him. And what is it to suffer immortal souls to perish, when our persuasions and example may be the means of preventing it? 13,14. We are quickened to the study of wisdom by considering both the pleasure and the profit of it. All men relish things that are sweet to the palate; but many have no relish for the things that are sweet to the purified soul, and that make us wise unto salvation. 15,16. The sincere soul falls as a traveller may do, by stumbling at some stone in his path; but gets up, and goes on his way with more care and speed.

It is good for food; there was plenty of it in Palestine, and it was eaten for food, not only by children, but grown persons; and was very nourishing, strengthening, and refreshing to them, as Samson, Jonathan, John the Baptist, and others; and is good for medicine, is healthful and salutary, and useful in many diseases: it is said (m) to conduce much to prolong life and preserve from diseases; it has been observed that those who have much used it have lived to a great age; <p>and the honeycomb, which is sweet to thy taste; because it is so, as all honey is, and especially that which is immediately squeezed or drops from the honeycomb; this is said not so much on account of honey, and the eating of that, as for what follows concerning the knowledge of wisdom, which is comparable to it for pleasure and profit; see <a href="/proverbs/16-24.htm">Proverbs 16:24</a> (n). <p>(m) Athenaei Deipnosophist. l. 2. c. 7. p. 46, 47. so Pierius Valerian. apud Steeb.

It was especially used for children's food (<a href="/isaiah/7-15.htm">Isaiah 7:15</a>), and thus becomes an emblem of the purest wisdom.

From this, that wisdom is a power which accomplishes great things, it follows that it is of high value, though to the fool it appears all too costly.<p>7 Wisdom seems to the fool to be an ornamental commodity;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; He openeth not his mouth in the gate.<p>Most interpreters take &#1512;&#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; for &#1512;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; (written as at <a href="/1_chronicles/6-58.htm">1 Chronicles 6:58</a>; cf. <a href="/zechariah/14-10.htm">Zechariah 14:10</a>; &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;, <a href="/proverbs/10-4.htm">Proverbs 10:4</a>; &#1511;&#1488;&#1501;, <a href="/hosea/10-14.htm">Hosea 10:14</a>), and translate, as Jerome and Luther: "Wisdom is to the fool too high;" the way to wisdom is to him too long and too steep, the price too costly, and not to be afforded. Certainly this thought does not lie far distant from what the poet would say; but why does he say &#1495;&#1499;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, and not &#1495;&#1499;&#1502;&#1492;? This &#1495;&#1499;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; is not a numerical plur., so as to be translated with the Venet.: &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b9; &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#788; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;; it is a plur., as <a href="/psalms/49-4.htm">Psalm 49:4</a> shows; but, as is evident from the personification and the construction, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/1-20.htm">Proverbs 1:20</a>, one inwardly multiplying and heightening, which is related to &#1495;&#1499;&#1502;&#1492; as science or the contents of knowledge is to knowledge. That this plur. comes here into view as in chap. 1-9 (vid., vol. i. p. 34), is definitely accounted for in these chapters by the circumstance that wisdom was to be designated, which is the mediatrix of all wisdom; here, to be designated in intentional symphony with &#1512;&#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, whose plur. ending th shall be for that very reason, however, inalienable. Thus &#1512;&#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; will be the name of a costly foreign bijouterie, which is mentioned in the Book of Job, where the unfathomableness and inestimableness of wisdom is celebrated; vid., <a href="//biblehub.com/job/27-18.htm">Job 27:18</a>, where we have recorded what we had to say at the time regarding this word. But what is now the meaning of the saying that wisdom is to the fool a pearl or precious coral? Jol Bril explains: "The fool uses the sciences like a precious stone, only for ornament, but he knows not how to utter a word publicly," This is to be rejected, because &#1512;&#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; is not so usual a trinket or ornament as to serve as an expression of this thought. The third of the comparison lies in the rarity, costliness, unattainableness; the fool despises wisdom, because the expenditure of strength and the sacrifices of all kinds which are necessary to put one into the possession of wisdom deter him from it (Rashi). This is also the sense which the expression has when &#1512;&#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;  equals  &#1512;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;; and probably for the sake of this double meaning the poet chose just this word, and not &#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, &#1490;&#1489;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, or any other name, for articles of ornament (Hitzig). The Syr. has incorrectly interpreted this play upon words: sapientia abjecta stulto; and the Targumist: the fool grumbles (&#1502;&#1514;&#1512;&#1506;&#1501;) against wisdom.<p>(Note: This explanation is more correct than Levy's: he lifts himself up (boasts) with wisdom.)<p>He may also find the grapes to be sour because they hang too high for him; here it is only said that wisdom remains at a distance from him because he cannot soar up to its attainment; for that very reason he does not open his mouth in the gate, where the council and the representatives of the people have their seats: he has not the knowledge necessary for being associated in counselling, and thus must keep silent; and this is indeed the most prudent thing he can do. </body></html>
