See what a blessing the husbandman's calling is, and what a wilderness this earth would be without it. See what great difference there is in the management even of worldly affairs. Sloth and self-indulgence are the bane of all good. When we see fields overgrown with thorns and thistles, and the fences broken down, we see an emblem of the far more deplorable state of many souls. Every vile affection grows in men's hearts; yet they compose themselves to sleep.

The sight of the field and vineyard of the slothful put Solomon in mind of an observation he had made before, which fitly describes the disposition and gesture of the sluggard, by which means his field and vineyard came to ruin; while he should be up and tilling his field and planting his vineyard, he is in his bed; and awaking, instead of rising, craves for and indulges himself in another little doze, and which he repeats again and again; <p>a little folding of the hands to sleep; which ought to have been employed another way; See Gill on <a href="/proverbs/6-10.htm">Proverbs 6:10</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/24.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><i>Yet</i> a little sleep, <span class="cverse3">{l}</span> a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:</span><p>(l) Read Geneva Pr 6:10</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 33, 34.</span> - These verses are a repetition, with very slight variations, of <a href="/proverbs/6-10.htm">Proverbs 6:10, 11</a> (where see notes), and possibly have been introduced here by a later editor. Ver. 33 seems to be the sluggard's own words; Ver. 34 shows the result of his sloth. There are numberless proverbs dedicated to this subject in all languages; <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, "No sweat, no sweet;" "No pains, no gains; .... He that wad eat the kernel maun crack the nut;" "A punadas entran las buenas hadas," "Good luck enters by dint of cuffs" (Spanish); "Nihil agendo male agere discimus; .... The dog in the kennel," say the Chinese. "barks at his fleas; the dog that hunts does not feel them" (Kelly). "Sloth and much sleep," say the Arabs, "remove from God and bring on poverty." The LXX. is somewhat dramatic in its rendering: "Afterwards I repented (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>), I looked that I might receive instruction.

But if thou do this, thy poverty will come advancing, and thy want like a good runner (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>)" The word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> occurs in <a href="/proverbs/6-10.htm">Proverbs 6:10</a>, but nowhere else in the Septuagint. It is used by St. Mark (<a href="/mark/9-36.htm">Mark 9:36</a>; <a href="/mark/10-16.htm">Mark 10:16</a>). It has been thought that the original <span class="accented">mashal</span> ended with Ver. 32, the following passage being added by a scribe as illustrative in a marginal note, which afterwards crept into the text. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/24.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Warning against the establishing of a household where the previous conditions are wanting:<p>Set in order thy work without,<p>And make it ready for thyself beforehand in the fields, - <p>After that then mayest thou build thine house.<p>The interchange of &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509; and &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1491;&#1492; shows that by &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1499;&#1514; &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1491;&#1492; field-labour, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-26.htm">1 Chronicles 27:26</a>, is meant. &#1492;&#1499;&#1497;&#1503;, used of arrangement, procuring, here with &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1499;&#1492;, signifies the setting in order of the word, viz., the cultivation of the field.

One begins at the wrong end when he begins with the building of his house, which is much rather the result and goal of an intelligent discharge of duty within the sphere of one's calling.
