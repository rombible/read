The well-spring of wisdom in the heart of a believer, continually supplies words of wisdom. 5. The merits of a cause must be looked to, not the person. 6,7. What mischief bad men do to themselves by their ungoverned tongues! 8. How base are those that sow contention! and what fatal effects may be expected from small beginnings of jealousy! 9. Omissions of duty, and in duty, are fatal to the soul, as well as commissions of sin. 10,11. The Divine power, made known in and through our Lord Jesus Christ, forms a strong tower for the believer, who relies on the Lord. How deceitful the defence of the rich man, who has his portion and treasure in this world! It is a strong city and a high wall only in his own conceit; for it will fail when most in need. They will be exposed to the just wrath of that Judge whom they despised as a Saviour. 12. After the heart has been lifted up with pride, a fall comes. But honour shall be the reward of humility. 13. Eagerness, with self-conceit, will expose to shame. 14. Firmness of mind supports under many pains and trials. But when the conscience is tortured with remorse, no human fortitude can bear the misery; what then will hell be? 15. We must get knowledge, not only into our heads, but into our hearts. 16. Blessed be the Lord, who makes us welcome to come to his throne, without money and without price.

Instead of &#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1492;, Hitzig, after Jerome, adopts the emendation &#1500;&#1514;&#1488;&#1504;&#1492;, "after an occasion" (a pretext), and by &#1504;&#1508;&#1512;&#1491; thinks of one pushed aside, who, thrown into opposition, seeks to avenge himself. But his translation of 1b, "against all that is fortunate he gnasheth his teeth," shows how much the proverb is opposed to this interpretation. &#1504;&#1508;&#1512;&#1491; denotes one who willingly (<a href="/judges/4-11.htm">Judges 4:11</a>), and, indeed, obstinately withdraws himself. The construction of &#1497;&#1489;&#1511;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; with &#1500; (also <a href="/job/10-6.htm">Job 10:6</a>) is explained by this, that the poet, giving prominence to the object, would set it forward: a pleasure (&#1514;&#1488;&#1493;&#1492;, as Arab. hawan, unstable and causeless direction of the mind to something, pleasure, freak, caprice), and nothing else, he goes after who has separated himself (Fl.); the effort of the separatist goes out after a pleasure, i.e., the enjoyment and realization of such; instead of seeking to conform himself to the law and ordinance of the community, he seeks to carry out a separate view, and to accomplish some darling plan: libidinem sectatur sui cerebri homo. With this 1b accords. &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; (vid., at <a href="/proverbs/2-7.htm">Proverbs 2:7</a>) is concretely that which furthers and profits. Regarding &#1492;&#1514;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1506;, vid., at <a href="/proverbs/17-14.htm">Proverbs 17:14</a>. Thus putting his subjectivity in the room of the common weal, he shows his teeth, places himself in fanatical opposition against all that is useful and profitable in the principles and aims, the praxis of the community from which he separates himself. The figure is true to nature: the polemic of the schismatic and the sectary against the existing state of things, is for the most part measureless and hostile. </body></html>
