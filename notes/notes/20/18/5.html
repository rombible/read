The well-spring of wisdom in the heart of a believer, continually supplies words of wisdom. 5. The merits of a cause must be looked to, not the person. 6,7. What mischief bad men do to themselves by their ungoverned tongues! 8. How base are those that sow contention! and what fatal effects may be expected from small beginnings of jealousy! 9. Omissions of duty, and in duty, are fatal to the soul, as well as commissions of sin. 10,11. The Divine power, made known in and through our Lord Jesus Christ, forms a strong tower for the believer, who relies on the Lord. How deceitful the defence of the rich man, who has his portion and treasure in this world! It is a strong city and a high wall only in his own conceit; for it will fail when most in need. They will be exposed to the just wrath of that Judge whom they despised as a Saviour. 12. After the heart has been lifted up with pride, a fall comes. But honour shall be the reward of humility. 13. Eagerness, with self-conceit, will expose to shame. 14. Firmness of mind supports under many pains and trials. But when the conscience is tortured with remorse, no human fortitude can bear the misery; what then will hell be? 15. We must get knowledge, not only into our heads, but into our hearts. 16. Blessed be the Lord, who makes us welcome to come to his throne, without money and without price. May his gifts make room for him in our souls.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The parallelism of the two clauses is probably one of contrast.

(For the expression, comp. <a href="/leviticus/19-15.htm">Leviticus 19:15</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/1-17.htm">Deuteronomy 1:17</a>; and in our book, <a href="/proverbs/24-23.htm">Proverbs 24:23</a>; <a href="/proverbs/28-21.htm">Proverbs 28:21</a>.)

The phrase &#1497;&#1491;&#1506; &#1491;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514; (here and at <a href="/daniel/1-4.htm">Daniel 1:4</a>) means to possess knowledge (novisse); more frequently it is &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492; &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;, e.g., <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/4-1.htm">Proverbs 4:1</a>, where &#1497;&#1491;&#1506; has the inchoative sense of noscere. In 27b the Ker&#305;&#770; is &#1497;&#1511;&#1512;&#1470;&#1512;&#1493;&#1495;. Jerome translates it pretiosi spiritus, the Venet. &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;. Rashi glosses &#1497;&#1511;&#1512; here, as at <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-1.htm">1 Samuel 3:1</a>, by &#1502;&#1504;&#1493;&#1506; (thus to be read after codd.), retentus spiritu; most interpreters remark that the spirit here comes into view as expressing itself in words. It is scarcely correct to say that &#1497;&#1511;&#1512; &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; could designate one who is sparing in his words, but &#1497;&#1511;&#1512;&#1470;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; is, according to the fundamental conception of the verb &#1497;&#1511;&#1512;, gravis spiritu (Schultens), of a dignified, composed spirit; it is a quiet seriousness proceeding from high conscientiousness, and maintaining itself in self-control, which is designated by this word. But the Cheth&#305;&#770;b &#1493;&#1511;&#1512;&#1470;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; presents almost the same description of character. &#1511;&#1512; from &#1511;&#1512;&#1512; (of the same root as &#1497;&#1511;&#1512;) means to be firm, unmoveable, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, hence to be congealed, frozen, cold (cf. frigus with rigere, rigor), figuratively to be cold-blooded, passionless, quiet, composed (Fl.); cf. post-bibl. &#1511;&#1512;&#1514; &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; (Arab. k&#803;urrat&#8219;ain), cooling  equals  refreshing, &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; (<a href="/acts/3-20.htm">Acts 3:20</a>).<p>(Note: "He has made my eye glowing" (askhn, cf. &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1497;&#1503;) is in Arab. equivalent to "he has deeply troubled me." The eye of the benevolent is ba&#770;rid, and in the Semitic manner of expression, with deep psychological significance, it is said that the tears of sorrow are hot, but those of joy cold.)<p>Whether we read &#1497;&#1511;&#1512; or &#1511;&#1512;, in any case we are not to translate rarus spiritu, which, apart from the impossibility of the expression, makes 27b almost a tautological repetition of the thought of 27a. The first line recommends bridling of the tongue, in contrast to inconsiderate and untimely talk; the second line recommends coldness, i.e., equanimity of spirit, in contrast to passionate heat. </body></html>
