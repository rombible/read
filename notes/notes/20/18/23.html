Great care must be taken to prevent quarrels among relations and those under obligations to each other. Wisdom and grace make it easy to forgive; but corruption makes it difficult. 20. The belly is here put for the heart, as elsewhere; and what that is filled with, our satisfaction will be accordingly, and our inward peace. 21. Many a one has caused his own death, or the death of others, by a false or injurious tongue. 22. A good wife is a great blessing to a man, and it is a token of Divine favour. 23. Poverty tells men they must not order or demand. And at the throne of God's grace we are all poor, and must use entreaties. 24. Christ Jesus never will forsake those who trust in and love him. May we be such friends to others, for our Master's sake.

Or "supplications" (a); he is an humble supplicant to others for favours he asks in a submissive and lowly manner; he does not demand anything, nor prescribe what shall be done for him, but modestly tells his case, and submits it; so such who are poor in spirit are humble supplicants at the throne of grace; <p>but the rich answereth roughly; being proud and haughty, lifted up with their riches, and in fear of none, they answer others with hard and rough words, especially their inferiors, and particularly the poor.

The Codex Venetus Marcianus (23, Holmes and Parsons) is the only uncial that contains them. <span class="cmt_word">The poor useth intreaties; but the rich answereth roughly.</span> The irony of the passage is more strongly expressed by Siracides: "The rich man hath done wrong, and yet he threateneth withal: the poor is wronged, and he must intreat also" (Ecclus. 13:3). The rich man not only does wrong, but accompanies the injury with passionate language and abuse, as if he were the sufferer; while the poor man has humbly to ask pardon, as if he were in the wrong. Thus the Roman satirist writes - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Libertas pauperis haec est:<br />Pulsatus rogat et pugnis concisus adorat,<br />Ut liceat paucis cum dentibus inde reverti."</span><br />(<span class="note_acc">Juv., 'Sat.,' 3:299.</span>) Aben Ezra explains the verse as denoting that a poor man making a submissive request from a rich man is answered cruelly and roughly. The hardening effect of wealth is seen in our Lord's parables of Dives and Lazarus (<a href="/luke/16.htm">Luke 16</a>), and the Pharisee and the publican (<a href="/luke/18.htm">Luke 18</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/18.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>17 He that is first in his controversy is right;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But there cometh another and searcheth him thoroughly - <p>an exhortation to be cautious in a lawsuit, and not to justify without more ado him who first brings forward his cause, and supports it by reasons, since, if the second party afterwards search into the reasons of the first, they show themselves untenable. &#1492;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503; &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1489;&#1493; are to be taken together; the words are equivalent to &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1497;&#1489;&#1488; &#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1489;&#1493; &#1489;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492;: qui prior cum causa sua venit, i.e., eam ad judicem defert (Fl.). &#1492;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503; may, however, also of itself alone be qui prior venit; and &#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1489;&#1493; will be taken with &#1510;&#1491;&#1497;&#1511;: justus qui prior venit in causa sua (esse videtur).
