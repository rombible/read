In every age there are monsters of ingratitude who ill-treat their parents. Many persuade themselves they are holy persons, whose hearts are full of sin, and who practise secret wickedness. There are others whose lofty pride is manifest. There have also been cruel monsters in every age. 15-17. Cruelty and covetousness are two daughters of the horseleech, that still cry, Give, give, and they are continually uneasy to themselves. Four things never are satisfied, to which these devourers are compared. Those are never rich that are always coveting. And many who have come to a bad end, have owned that their wicked courses began by despising their parents' authority. 18-20. Four things cannot be fully known. The kingdom of nature is full of marvels. The fourth is a mystery of iniquity; the cursed arts by which a vile seducer gains the affections of a female; and the arts which a vile woman uses to conceal her wickedness. 21-23 Four sorts of persons are very troublesome. Men of low origin and base spirit, who, getting authority, become tyrants. Foolish and violent men indulging in excesses. A woman of a contentious spirit and vicious habits. A servant who has obtained undue influence.

B. Michaelis). We translate the text here as it lies before us:<p>15 The &#8219;Alu&#770;ka hath two daughters: Give! Give!<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three of these are never satisfied;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Four say not: Enough!<p>16 The under-world and the closing of the womb;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The earth is not satisfied with water;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the fire saith not: Enough!<p>We begin with Masoretic externalities. The first &#1489; in &#1492;&#1489; is Beth minusculum; probably it had accidentally this diminutive form in the original MSS, to which the Midrash (cf. Sepher Taghin ed. Bargs, 1866, p. 47) has added absurd conceits. This first &#1492;&#1489; has Pasek after it, which in this case is servant to the Olewejored going before, according to the rule Thorath Emeth, p. 24, here, as at <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/85-9.htm">Psalm 85:9</a>, Mehuppach. The second &#1492;&#1489;, which of itself alone is the representative of Olewejored, has in Hutter, as in the Cod. Erfurt 2, and Cod. 2 of the Leipzig Public Library, the pausal punctuation &#1492;&#1489; (cf. &#1511;&#1495;, <a href="/1_samuel/21-10.htm">1 Samuel 21:10</a>), but which is not sufficiently attested. Instead of &#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;, 15b, &#1500;&#1488; &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;, and instead of &#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1492; f, 16b, &#1500;&#1488; &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1492; are to be written; the Zinnorith removes the Makkeph, according to Thorath Emeth, p. 9, Accentuationssystem, iv. 2. Instead of &#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, 16a, only Jablonski, as Mhlau remarks, has &#1502;&#1497;&#1501;; but incorrectly, since Athnach, after Olewejored, has no pausal force (vid., Thorath Emeth, p. 37). All that is without any weight as to the import of the words. But the punctuation affords some little service for the setting aside of a view of Rabbenu Tam (vid., Tosaphoth to Aboda zara 17a, and Erubin 19a), which has been lately advocated by Lwenstein. That view is, that &#8219;Alu&#770;ka is the name of a wise man, not Solomon's, because the Pesikta does not reckon this among the names of Solomon, nor yet a name of hell, because it is not, in the Gemara, numbered among the names of Gehinnom. Thus &#1500;&#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511;&#1492; would be a superscription, like &#1500;&#1491;&#1493;&#1491; and &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1502;&#1492;, <a href="/psalms/26-1.htm">Psalm 26:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/72-1.htm">Psalm 72:1</a>, provided with Asla Legarmeh. But this is not possible, for the Asla Legarmeh, at <a href="/psalms/26-1.htm">Psalm 26:1</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/72-1.htm">Psalm 72:1</a>, is the transformation of Olewejored, inadmissible on the first word of the verse (Accentuationssystem, xix. 1); but no Olewejored can follow such an Asla Legarmeh, which has the force of an Olewejored, as after this &#1500;&#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1511;&#1492;, which the accentuation then does not regard as the author's name given as a superscription. &#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511;&#1492; is not the name of a person, and generally not a proper name, but a generic name of certain traditional signification. "One must drink no water" - says the Gemara Aboda zara 12b - "out of a river or pond, nor (immediately) with his mouth, nor by means of his hand; he who, nevertheless, does it, his blood comes on his own head, because of the danger. What danger? &#1505;&#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1514; &#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511;&#1492;," i.e., the danger of swallowing a leech. The Aram. also designates a leech by &#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511;&#1488; (cf. e.g., Targ. <a href="/psalms/12-9.htm">Psalm 12:9</a>: hence the godless walk about like the leech, which sucks the blood of men), and the Arab. by 'alak&#803; (n. unit. 'alak&#803;at), as the word is also rendered here by the Aram. and Arab. translators. Accordingly, all the Greeks render it by &#x3b2;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;; Jerome, by sanguisuga (Rashi, sangsue); also Luther's Eigel is not the Igel erinaceus [hedgehog], but the Egel, i.e., as we now designate it, the Blutegel [leech], or (less correctly) Blutigel. &#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511;&#1492; is the fem. of the adj. &#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511;, attached to, which meaning, together with the whole verbal stem, the Arab. has preserved (vid., Mhlau's Mittheilung des Art. 'aluka aus dem Kamus, p. 42).<p>(Note: Nldeke has remarked, with reference to Mhlau's Monographie, that &#8219;aluk&#803;a, in the sense of tenacious (tenax), is also found in Syr. (Geopon. xiii. 9, xli. 26), and that generally the stem &#1506;&#1500;&#1511;, to cleave, to adhere, is more common in Aram. than one would suppose. But this, however common in Arab., is by no means so in Syr.; and one may affirm that, among other Arabisms found in the Proverbs of Agur, the word &#8219;Alu&#770;ka has decidedly an Arab. sound.)<p>But if, now, the &#8219;Alu&#770;ka is the leech,<p>(Note: In Sanscrit the leech is called galaukas (masc.) or galauka&#770; (fem.), i.e., the inhabitant of the water (from gala, water, and o&#770;kas, dwelling). Ewald regards this as a transformation of the Semitic name.)<p>which are then its two daughters, to which is here given the name &#1492;&#1489; &#1492;&#1489;, and which at the same time have this cry of desire in their mouths? Grotius and others understand, by the two daughters of the leech, the two branches of its tongue; more correctly: the double-membered overlip of its sucker. C. B. Michaelis thinks that the greedy cry, "Give! Give!" is personified: voces istae concipiuntur ut hirudinis filiae, quas ex se gignat et velut mater sobolem impense diligat. But since this does not satisfy, symbolical interpretations of &#8219;Aluka have been resorted to. The Talmud, Aboda zara 17a, regards it as a name of hell. In this sense it is used in the language of the Pijut (synagogue poetry).<p>(Note: So says e.g., Salomo ha-Babli, in a Zulath of the first Chanukka-Sabbats (beginning &#1488;&#1497;&#1503; &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; &#1495;&#1500;&#1507;): &#1497;&#1511;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468; &#1499;&#1468;&#1492;&#1489;&#1492;&#1489;&#1497; &#1506;&#1500;&#1511;, they burn like the flames of hell.)<p>If &#8219;Alu&#770;ka is hell, then fancy has the widest room for finding an answer to the question, What are the two daughters? The Talmud supposes that &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1514; (the worldly domination) and &#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; (heresy) are meant. The Church-fathers also, understanding by &#8219;Alu&#770;ka the power of the devil, expatiated in such interpretations. Of the same character are Calmet's interpretation, that sanguisuga is a figure of the mala cupiditas, and its twin-daughters are avaritia and ambitio. The truth lying in all these is this, that here there must be some kind of symbol. But if the poet meant, by the two daughters of the &#8219;Alu&#770;ka, two beings or things which he does not name, then he kept the best of his symbol to himself. And could he use &#8219;Alu&#770;ka, this common name for the leech, without further intimation, in any kind of symbolical sense? The most of modern interpreters do nothing to promote the understanding of the word, for they suppose that &#8219;Alu&#770;ka, from its nearest signification, denotes a demoniacal spirit of the character of a vampire, like the Dakin of the Indians, which nourish themselves on human flesh; the ghouls of the Arabs and Persians, which inhabit graveyards, and kill and eat men, particularly wanderers in the desert; in regard to which it is to be remarked, that (Arab.) &#8219;awlak&#803; is indeed a name for a demon, and that al&#8219;aluwak&#803;, according to the Kamus, is used in the sense of alghwal. Thus Dathe, Dderlein, Ziegler, Umbreit; thus also Hitzig, Ewald, and others. Mhlau, while he concurs in this understanding of the word, and now throwing open the question, Which, then, are the two daughters of the demoness &#8219;Alu&#770;ka? finds no answer to it in the proverb itself, and therefore accepts of the view of Ewald, since 15b-16, taken by themselves, form a fully completed whole, that the line '&#1500;&#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1511;&#1492; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; is the beginning of a numerical proverb, the end of which is wanting. We acknowledge, because of the obscurity - not possibly aimed at by the author himself - in which the two daughters remain, the fragmentary characters of the proverb of the &#8219;Alu&#770;ka; Stuart also does this, for he regards it as brought out of a connection in which it was intelligible - but we believe that the line '&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; is an original formal part of this proverb. For the proverb forming, according to Mhlau's judgment, a whole rounded off:<p>continued...</body></html>
