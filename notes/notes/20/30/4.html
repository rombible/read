Had it not been for Christ, the foundations of the earth had sunk under the load of the curse upon the ground, for man's sin. Who, and what is the mighty One that doeth all this?

That has been thither to fetch knowledge of God and divine things, and has returned to communicate it. Enoch was taken up to heaven before this time: and Elijah, as is very probable, after; but neither of them returned again, to inform mortals what was to be seen, known, and enjoyed there: since, the Apostle Paul was caught up into the third heaven, and came back again; but then the things he heard were such as it was not lawful for a man to utter: and indeed, since the coming of Christ there is no need of any further revelation to be made nor of any such expedition, in order to obtain it, <a href="/romans/10-6.htm">Romans 10:6</a>. And, properly speaking, there never was any besides him, whose names are Ithiel and Ucal, that ever did this: he lay in the bosom of the Father, and was privy to his whole mind and will; he descended from heaven to earth not by local motion, but, by assumption of nature; and when he had made known his Father's will, and done his work, he ascended far above all heavens, and received gifts for men; to fill his churches and ministers with them, in order to communicate and improve spiritual and divine knowledge; and therefore, with great propriety and pertinence, he applies these words to himself, <a href="/john/3-13.htm">John 3:13</a>; <p>who hath gathered the wind in his fists? not any mere creature; not any man or set of men; it is not in the power of any, either men or angels, to restrain or let loose the winds at pleasure; nor has Satan, though called the prince of the power of the air, that is, of the devils in the air, any such command of them; none but he that made them can command them to blow, or be still; even he who brings them out of his treasures, and his own son, whom the wind and seas obeyed; see <a href="/psalms/135-7.htm">Psalm 135:7</a>; The Heathens (w) themselves are so sensible of this, that the power of the winds only belongs to God, that they have framed a deity they call Aeolus; whom the supreme Being has made a kind of steward or store keeper of the winds, and given him a power to still or raise them as he pleases (x); <p>who hath bound the waters in a garment? either the waters above, which are bound in the thick clouds as in a garment which hold them from pouring out; or the waters of the sea, which are as easily managed by the Lord as an infant by its parent, and is wrapped about with a swaddling band, <a href="/job/26-8.htm">Job 26:8</a>. But can any creature do this? none but the mighty God; and his almighty Son the Ithiel and Ucal, who clothes the heavens with blackness, and makes sackcloth their covering: even he who is the Redeemer of this people, and has the tongue of the learned, to speak a word in season to them <a href="/isaiah/50-2.htm">Isaiah 50:2</a>; <p>who hath established all the ends of the earth? fixed the boundaries of the several parts of the world, Europe, Asia, Africa, and America, and the several countries in them? settled the foundations of the earth, and secured the banks and borders of it from the raging of the sea? None but these next mentioned; see <a href="/job/38-4.htm">Job 38:4</a>; <p>what is his name, and what is his son's name, if thou canst tell? if thou surest it is a mere man that does all these things tell his name; or, if he be dead, say what is the name of his son or of any of his family; so Jarchi and others interpret it: or rather, since it is the Lord alone and his own proper Son, to whom these things can he ascribed say what is his name; that is, his nature and perfections which are incomprehensible and ineffable; otherwise he is known by his name Jehovah and especially as his name is proclaimed in Christ and manifested by him and in his Gospel: and seeing he has a son of the same nature with him, and possessed of the same perfections, co-essential, and co-existent, and every way equal to him, and a distinct person from him, say what is his nature and perfections also; declare his generation and the manner of it; his divine filiation, and in what class it is; things which are out of the reach of human capacity, and not to be expressed by the tongue of men and angels; see <a href="/matthew/11-27.htm">Matthew 11:27</a>. Otherwise, though his name for a while was a secret, and he was only called the seed of the woman and of Abraham, <a href="/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>; yet he had many names given him under the Old Testament; as Shiloh, Immanuel, the Wonderful, Counsellor, the mighty God, the everlasting Father, and Prince of peace; the Lord our righteousness, and the Man, the Branch: and under the New Testament, Jesus the Saviour, Christ the Anointed; the Head of the church, the Judge of the world; the Word of God, and King of kings, and Lord of lords. This Scripture is a proof of Christ's being the eternal Son of God; of his equality with his divine Father as such, their name and nature being alike ineffable; of his co-existence with his Father as such; and of his omnipresence and omnipotence, expressed by the phrases here used of ascending, &amp;c. and of his distinct personality from the Father; the same question being distinctly put of him as of the Father.

He cannot question the ‘eternal power and divinity,’ which alone can account for this ordered universe.

Who is he whose universal providence is felt and experienced? Where is this mysterious Being who hides himself from human ken? Christ has said something like this, "No man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven" (<a href="/john/3-13.htm">John 3:13</a>); and St. Paul (<a href="/ephesians/4-9.htm">Ephesians 4:9</a>). In biblical language God is said to come down from heaven in order to punish, to aid, to reveal his will, etc. (<a href="/genesis/11-7.htm">Genesis 11:7</a>; <a href="/psalms/18-9.htm">Psalm 18:9</a>, etc.); and he returns to heaven when this intervention is finished (<a href="/genesis/17-22.htm">Genesis 17:22</a>; <a href="/genesis/35-13.htm">Genesis 35:13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Who hath gathered the wind in his fists?</span> Who hath the control of the viewless wind, so as to restrain it or release it at his pleasure?

As Job says (<a href="/job/26-8.htm">Job 26:8</a>), "He bindeth  up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is not rent under them." And again (<a href="/job/38-37.htm">Job 38:37</a>), "Who can number the clouds by wisdom? or who can pour out the bottles of heaven?" So the psalmist, "Thou coveredst it [the earth] with the deep as with a vesture" (<a href="/psalms/104-6.htm">Psalm 104:6</a>). (See above, <a href="/proverbs/8-27.htm">Proverbs 8:27</a>, etc.) <span class="cmt_word">Who hath established all the ends of the earth?</span> Who hath consolidated the foundations, and defined the limits, of the remotest regions of the earth? (comp. <a href="/job/38-4.htm">Job 38:4</a>, etc.). The answer to these four questions is "Almighty God." He alone can order and control the forces of nature. <span class="cmt_word">What is his name, and what is his son's name, if thou canst tell?</span> or, <span class="accented">if thou knowest</span>. It is not enough to acknowledge the power and operation and providence of this mysterious Being; Agur longs to know more of his nature, his essence. He must have personality; he is not an abstraction, a force, a quality; he is a Person. What, then, is his name, the name which expresses what he is in himself? Men have different appellations for this Supreme Being, according as they regard one or other of his attributes: is there one name that comprehends all, which gives an adequate account of the incomprehensible Creator? The question cannot be answered affirmatively in this life. "We know that if he shall be manifested, we shall be like him; for we shall see him even as he is" (<a href="/1_john/3-2.htm">1 John 3:2</a>). The further question, "What is his son's name?" has given some difficulty. The LXX. has, "What is the name of his children (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>)?" as if there was reference to Israel, the special children of God. But the original does not bear out this interpretation, which is also opposed to the idea of the enigma proposed. The inquiry might mean - Are we to apply to the Supreme Being the same notion of natural relationship with which we are familiar in the human family? But this seems a low and unworthy conception. Or the "son" might be primeval man (<a href="/job/15-7.htm">Job 15:7</a>) or the sage; but the answer would not be satisfactory, and would not tend to solve the great question. There are two replies which can be made to Agur's interrogation. Looking to the marvellous description of Wisdom in <a href="/proverbs/8-22.htm">Proverbs 8:22</a>, etc., we may consider Wisdom to be a denotation of the Son of God, and the inquirer desires to know the name and nature of this personage, of whose existence he was certified. Or he may have arrived at a knowledge of the only begotten Son of God, as the idea of the Logos is more or less developed in the Book of Wisdom, in Philo's treatises, and in the Alexandrian school; and longs for more perfect knowledge. This, indeed, is hidden: "He hath name written, which no one knoweth but he himself" (<a href="/revelation/19-12.htm">Revelation 19:12</a>). It is useless to put such question to a fellow man; no human mind can fathom the nature of the Godhead, or trace out its operations (Ecclus. 18:4, etc.). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/29.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>25 Fear of man bringeth a snare with it;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But he that trusteth in Jahve is advanced.<p>It sounds strange, Hitzig remarks, that here in the Book of an Oriental author one should be warned against the fear of man. It is enough, in reply to this, to point to <a href="/isaiah/51-12.htm">Isaiah 51:12</a>. One of the two translations in the lxx (cf. Jerome and Luther) has found this "strange" thought not so strange as not to render it, and that in the gnomic aorist: &#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;. And why should not &#1495;&#1512;&#1491;&#1468;&#1514; &#1488;&#1491;&#1501; be able to mean the fear of man (cowardice)? Perhaps not so that &#1488;&#1491;&#1501; is the gen. objecti, but so that &#1495;&#1512;&#1491;&#1514; &#1488;&#1491;&#1501; means to frighten men, as in <a href="/1_samuel/14-15.htm">1 Samuel 14:15</a>. &#1495;&#1512;&#1491;&#1514; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501;, a trembling of God; cf. <a href="/psalms/64-2.htm">Psalm 64:2</a>; &#1508;&#1495;&#1491; &#1488;&#1497;&#1489;, the fear occasioned by the enemy, although this connection, after <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-25.htm">Deuteronomy 2:25</a>, can also mean fear of the enemy (gen. objecti). To &#1497;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503;, occasioned  equals  brings as a consequence with it, cf. <a href="/proverbs/10-10.htm">Proverbs 10:10</a>; <a href="/proverbs/13-15.htm">Proverbs 13:15</a>; the synallage generis is as at <a href="/proverbs/12-25.htm">Proverbs 12:25</a> : it is at least strange with fem. infinit. and infinitival nouns, <a href="/proverbs/16-16.htm">Proverbs 16:16</a>; <a href="/proverbs/25-14.htm">Proverbs 25:14</a>; <a href="/psalms/73-28.htm">Psalm 73:28</a>; but &#1495;&#1512;&#1491;&#1468;&#1492; (trembling) is such a nom. actionis, Ewald, 238a. Regarding &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1490;&#1468;&#1489; (for which the lxx.1 &#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, and lxx2 &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;  equals  &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1495;), vid., at <a href="/proverbs/18-10.htm">Proverbs 18:10</a>. He who is put into a terror by a danger with which men threaten him, so as to do from the fear of man what is wrong, and to conceal the truth, falls thereby into a snare laid by himself - it does not help him that by this means he has delivered himself from the danger, for he brands himself as a coward, and sins against God, and falls into an agony of conscience (reproach and anguish of heart) which is yet worse to bear than the evil wherewith he was threatened. It is only confidence in God that truly saves. The fear of man plunges him into yet greater suffering than that from which he would escape; confidence in God, on the other hand, lifts a man internally, and at last externally, above all his troubles. </body></html>
