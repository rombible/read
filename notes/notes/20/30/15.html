In every age there are monsters of ingratitude who ill-treat their parents. Many persuade themselves they are holy persons, whose hearts are full of sin, and who practise secret wickedness. There are others whose lofty pride is manifest. There have also been cruel monsters in every age. 15-17. Cruelty and covetousness are two daughters of the horseleech, that still cry, Give, give, and they are continually uneasy to themselves. Four things never are satisfied, to which these devourers are compared. Those are never rich that are always coveting. And many who have come to a bad end, have owned that their wicked courses began by despising their parents' authority. 18-20. Four things cannot be fully known. The kingdom of nature is full of marvels. The fourth is a mystery of iniquity; the cursed arts by which a vile seducer gains the affections of a female; and the arts which a vile woman uses to conceal her wickedness. 21-23 Four sorts of persons are very troublesome. Men of low origin and base spirit, who, getting authority, become tyrants. Foolish and violent men indulging in excesses. A woman of a contentious spirit and vicious habits.

Or "the blood sucker" (l); so it began to be called in the times of Pliny (m), to which the last generation of men may well be compared; blood thirsty creatures, that never have enough, and are not satisfied with the flesh of men, nor with their blood; and such particularly the Papists are: and not only this generation of men, but there are three or four things besides, which resemble the horse leech for its insatiableness; for the horse leech has not two daughters only, but more. Some, by her two daughters, understand the two forks of its tongue, which some naturalists say it has; though later ones, and more diligent inquirers into those things, find it has not; but either with its three teeth, or by the compression of its mouth on all sides, sucks the blood, and will not let go until it is filled with it (n): others have proposed the two sorts of leeches as its daughters, the sea leech, and that which is found in fenny and marshy places. But it is best, by its daughters, to understand such that resemble it, and are like unto it; as those that are of like nature and quality, and do the same things as others, are called their children; see <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/23-31.htm">Matthew 23:31</a>, <a href="/1_john/3-10.htm">1 John 3:10</a>; and so the number of its daughters, which are always craving and asking for more, and are never satisfied, are not only two, but more, as follows; <p>there are three things; or, "yea, there are three things" <p>that are never satiated: yea, four things say not, It is enough; not two only, but three, and even four, that are quite insatiable and are as follow. The Syriac version renders the whole thus, <p>"the horse leech hath three beloved daughters; three, "I say", they are, which are not satisfied; and the fourth says not, It is enough.'' <p>Some, as Abendana observes, interpret it of hell, by a transposition of the letters; because everyone that perverts his ways descends thither. Bochart (o) interprets it of fate, and so Noldius (p): and Schultens renders the word, the most monstrous of evils; it signifying in the Arabic language, as he observes, anything monstrous and dreadful; such as wood demons, serpents, and dragons, which devour men and beasts. Suidas (q), by the "horse leech", understands sin, whose daughters are fornication, envy, and idolatry, which are never satisfied by evil actions, and the fourth is evil concupiscence. <p>(l) "sanguisugae", V.

The form of the apothegm is climacteric, mounting from two to three, and thence to four, like the famous passage in <a href="/amos/1-3.htm">Amos 1:3</a>, etc. (comp. <a href="/proverbs/6-16.htm">Proverbs 6:16</a>, though there is no special stress there laid on the last member of the climax; <a href="/job/5-19.htm">Job 5:19</a>; <a href="/job/33-29.htm">Job 33:29</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/11-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 11:2</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The horseleach hath two daughters, crying, Give, give.</span> The word "crying" is not in the Hebrew, which says, "The <span class="accented">alukah</span> hath two daughters: Give! Give!" The insatiable appetite of this creature is represented by two words, which are personified as daughters, whom the mother has produced and dearly loves. This word <span class="accented">alukah</span> is not found again in the Old Testament; but in later Hebrew and in Aramaic it means "leech" or "bloodsucker;" and so it is translated by the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;</span>, and by St. Jerome <span class="accented">sanguisuga</span>. The word is derived from a root which in Arabic means "to adhere." There are several kinds of leeches common in Palestine, and their bloodthirsty nature is well known; as Horace says, 'Ars Poet.,' 476 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Non missura cutem, nisi plena cruoris, hirudo."</span> It seems simple and quite satisfactory to accept the word thus, and to see in the voracity of the leech an example of the greed further developed in the following clauses; but commentators have not been contented with this explanation, and have offered various suggestions which are either unnecessary or inadmissible. Thus the Talmud considers <span class="accented">alukah</span> to be an appellation of hell, and the two daughters to be the Power of the world, and Heresy. Some of the Fathers regard it as a symbol of the devil and his dominion; others, as a personification of cupidity with its two offshoots avarice and ambition. Some moderns deem it to mean a vampire or blood thirsty demon, a ghoul, in accordance with Eastern myth. But, as we have said, such interpretations are unnecessary and unsupported by sufficient authority. The allusion to the  tastes of the leech is found elsewhere. Thus Theocritus, 'Idyll.,' 2:55 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3b9;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f35;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span><br /><span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x1fb6;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f05;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> And Plautus, 'Epidic.,' 2:2, 5 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Jam ego me convortam in hirudinem atque<br />Eorum exsugebo sanguinem,<br />Senati qui columen cluent."</span> Ewald and others find traces of mutilation in this proverb, and endeavour to supply what is lost in various ways; but the text as it stands is intelligible, and needs no addition. The rest of the verse is an application of the truth first stated. The type of cupidity there enunciated is instanced and exemplified in four special cases. <span class="cmt_word">There are three things that are never satisfied.</span> And then a corrective climax is addressed. Yea, <span class="cmt_word">four things say not, It is enough.</span> The four in the following verse are divided into two plus two.

There follows a prayer to be kept in the truth, and to be preserved in the middle state, between poverty and riches. It is a Mashal-ode, vid., vol. i. p. 12. By the first prayer, "vanity and lies keep far from me," it is connected with the warning of <a href="/proverbs/30-6.htm">Proverbs 30:6</a>.<p>7 Two things I entreat from Thee,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Refuse them not to me before Idie.<p>8 Vanity and lies keep far away from me<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Poverty and riches give me not:<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Cause me to eat the bread which is allotted to me,<p>9 Lest in satiety Ideny,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; And say: Who is Jahve?<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; And lest, in becoming poor, Isteal,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; And profane the name of my God.<p>We begin with the settlement and explanation of the traditional punctuation. A monosyllable like &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1488; receives, if Legarmeh, always Mehuppach Legarmeh, while, on the contrary, the poly-syllable &#1488;&#1513;&#1474;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506; has Asla Legarmeh. &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1514;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503;&#1470;&#1500;&#1497;, with double Makkeph and with Gaja in the third syllable before the tone (after the Metheg-Setzung, 28), is Ben-Asher's; whereas Ben-Naphtali prefers the punctuation &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1514;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503; &#1500;&#1497; (vid., Baer's Genesis, p. 79, note 3). Also &#1508;&#1468;&#1503;&#1470;&#1488;&#1513;&#1474;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506; has (cf. &#1508;&#1468;&#1503;&#1470;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;, <a href="/proverbs/31-5.htm">Proverbs 31:5</a>) Makkeph, and on the antepenultima Gaja (vid., Thorath Emeth, p. 32). The perf. consec. &#1493;&#1499;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; has on the ult. the disjunctive Zinnor (Sarka), which always stands over the final letter; but that the ult. is also to be accented, is shown by the counter-tone Metheg, which is to be given to the first syllable. Also &#1493;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; has in correct Codd., e.g., Cod. 1294, the correct ultima toning of a perf. consec.; Kimchi in the Michlol 6b, as well as Aben Ezra in both of his Grammars, quotes only &#1493;&#1490;&#1504;&#1489;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; &#1493;&#1514;&#1508;&#1513;&#1474;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; as toned on the penult. That &#1493;&#1490;&#1504;&#1489;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; cannot be otherwise toned on account of the pausal accent, has been already remarked under 6b; the word, besides, belongs to the &#1505;&#1507;''&#1508;&#1514;&#1514;&#1497;&#1503; &#1489;&#1488;, i.e., to those which preserve their Pathach unlengthened by one of the greater disjunctives; the Athnach has certainly in the three so-called metrical books only the disjunctive form of the Zakeph of the prose books.
