As “artful men insinuate themselves into the affections of young women, and seduce them to their ruin, by an almost infinity of stratagems, which can never be all unravelled, so also the adulterous wife uses much ingenuity to impose on her husband, to shun detection, and to escape shame and punishment, by schemes and devices which cannot all be enumerated. Every new crime intended, or committed, gives rise to some new artifice; as the ship, in some degree, deviates every time from the course which it steered before.

In every age there are monsters of ingratitude who ill-treat their parents. Many persuade themselves they are holy persons, whose hearts are full of sin, and who practise secret wickedness. There are others whose lofty pride is manifest. There have also been cruel monsters in every age. 15-17. Cruelty and covetousness are two daughters of the horseleech, that still cry, Give, give, and they are continually uneasy to themselves. Four things never are satisfied, to which these devourers are compared. Those are never rich that are always coveting. And many who have come to a bad end, have owned that their wicked courses began by despising their parents' authority. 18-20. Four things cannot be fully known. The kingdom of nature is full of marvels. The fourth is a mystery of iniquity; the cursed arts by which a vile seducer gains the affections of a female; and the arts which a vile woman uses to conceal her wickedness. 21-23 Four sorts of persons are very troublesome. Men of low origin and base spirit, who, getting authority, become tyrants. Foolish and violent men indulging in excesses. A woman of a contentious spirit and vicious habits. A servant who has obtained undue influence.

It is equally unknown as the way of a man with a maid; it is difficult to detect her, she takes so much care and caution, and uses so many artful methods to conceal her wickedness from her husband; though she lives in adultery, it is in a most private manner, and carried on so secretly and artfully that she is not easily discovered; <p>she eateth, and wipeth her mouth; like one that eats what he should not, wipes his mouth that it might not be known or suspected he had ate anything; so such an adulteress commits the sin of adultery; and when she has done looks as grave and demure, and carries it so to her husband and all her friends, as if she was the chastest person upon earth. The allusion may be to harlots, who after an impure congress used to wash themselves (a), and had servants to wait upon them and serve them with water, called from hence "aquarioli" (b); <p>and saith, I have done no wickedness; she says by her behaviour, by her demure looks; and if suspected and challenged with it utterly denies it. This is an emblem of the antichristian whore of Rome, who, though the mother of harlots, and abominations of the earth; though guilty of the foulest adultery, that is, the grossest idolatry, yet pretends to be the pure and chaste spouse of Christ; and, under the guise of purity and holiness, and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness, seduces the minds of many; see <a href="/revelation/17-1.htm">Revelation 17:1</a>. <p>(a) "Dedecus hoc sumpta dissimulavit aqua", Ovid.

The “four things” of the two preceding verses find their moral in this verse. So lightly does the abandoned woman think of the consequences of her sin; so does it pass away when committed and leave no mark behind. It is but to eat and wipe the lips, and all trace of the food is gone.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/30.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - This verse is a kind of gloss or illustration of the last thought of the preceding verse, and seems not to have formed an original part of the numerical proverb. It might well be placed in a parenthesis. Many commentators consider it to be an interpolation. <span class="cmt_word">Such is the way of an adulterous woman.</span> What Agur had said of a man above, he now applies to the practised adulteress, whose sin cannot be traced. <span class="cmt_word">She eateth</span>. This is a euphemism for the sin which she commits, "Stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant" (<a href="/proverbs/9-17.htm">Proverbs 9:17</a>; comp. <a href="/proverbs/5-15.htm">Proverbs 5:15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And wipeth her mouth,</span> as if to leave no trace of her illicit repast. <span class="cmt_word">And saith, I have done no wickedness.</span> As she has sinned in secret, and there is no outward proof of her guilt, she boldly denies it. Septuagint, "Such is the way of an adulterous woman, who, when she has committed the act, having washed herself, says she has done nothing amiss." She forgets him who seeth in secret, and is quite content to escape detection at man's eyes, and to assume the character of a virtuous wife, which popular report assigns to her. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/30.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>There now follows a Priamel,<p>(Note: Cf. vol. i. p. 13. The name (from praeambulum) given to a peculiar form of popular gnomic poetry which prevailed in Germany from the 12th (e.g., the Meistersinger or Minstrel Sparvogel) to the 16th century, but was especially cultivated during the 14th and 15th centuries. Its peculiarity consisted in this, that after a series of antecedents or subjects, a briefly-expressed consequent or predicate was introduced as the epigrammatic point applicable to all these antecedents together. Vid., Erschenburg's Denkmlern altdeutscher Dichtkinst, Bremen 1799.)<p>the first line of which is, by &#1497;&#1511;&#1500;&#1500;, connected with the &#1497;&#1511;&#1500;&#1500;&#1498; of the preceding distich:<p>11 A generation that curseth their father,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And doth not bless their mother;<p>12 A generation pure in their own eyes,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And yet not washed from their filthiness;<p>13 A generation - how haughty their eyes,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And their eyelids lift themselves up;<p>14 A generation whose teeth are swords and their jaw teeth knives<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To devour the poor from the earth and the needy from the midst of men.<p>Ewald translates: O generation! but that would have required the word, 13a, &#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512; (<a href="/jeremiah/2-31.htm">Jeremiah 2:31</a>), and one would have expected to have found something mentioned which the generation addressed were to take heed to; but it is not so. But if "O generation!" should be equivalent to "O regarding the generation!" then &#1492;&#1493;&#1497; ought to have introduced the sentence. And if we translate, with Luther: There is a generation, etc., then &#1497;&#1513;&#1473; is supplied, which might drop out, but could not be omitted. The lxx inserts after &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; the word &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;, and then renders what follows as pred. - a simple expedient, but worthless. The Venet. does not need this expedient, for it renders &#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;; but then the order of the words in 11a would have been &#1491;&#1493;&#1512; &#1497;&#1511;&#1500;&#1500; &#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1493;; and in 12a, after the manner of a subst. clause, &#1491;&#1493;&#1512; &#1496;&#1492;&#1493;&#1512; &#1489;&#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493; &#1492;&#1493;&#1488;, one sees distinctly, from <a href="/proverbs/30-13.htm">Proverbs 30:13</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/30-14.htm">Proverbs 30:14</a>, that what follows &#1491;&#1493;&#1512; is to be understood, not as a pred., but as an attributive clause. As little can we interpret <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/30-14.htm">Proverbs 30:14</a>, with Lwenstein, as pred. of the three subj., "it is a generation whose teeth are swords;" that would at least have required the words &#1491;&#1493;&#1512; &#1492;&#1493;&#1488;; but <a href="/proverbs/30-14.htm">Proverbs 30:14</a> is not at all a judgment valid for all the three subjects. The Targ. and Jerome translate correctly, as we above;<p>(Note: The Syr. begins 11a as if &#1492;&#1493;&#1497; were to be supplied.)<p>but by this rendering there are four subjects in the preamble, and the whole appears, since the common pred. is wanting, as a mutilated Priamel. Perhaps the author meant to say: it is such a generation that encompasses us; or: such is an abomination to Jahve; for &#1491;&#1493;&#1512; is a Gesamtheit  equals  totality, generation of men who are bound together by contemporary existence, or homogeneity, or by both, but always a totality; so that these <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/30-11.htm">Proverbs 30:11-14</a>, might describe quatuor detestabilia genera hominum (C. B. Michaelis), and yet one generatio, which divide among themselves these four vices, of blackest ingratitude, loathsome self-righteousness, arrogant presumption, and unmerciful covetousness. Similar is the description given in the Mishna Sota ix. 14, of the character of the age in which the Messiah appeared. "The appearance of this age," thus it concludes, "is like the appearance of a dog; a son is not ashamed before his father; to whom will we then look for help? To our Father in heaven!"<p>continued...</body></html>
