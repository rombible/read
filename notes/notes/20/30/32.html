Against a king, against whom there is no rising up; by speaking evil of him, or rebelling against him; which is acting a foolish part, since it brings a man into troubles and difficulties inextricable; or by self-commendation, which is the height of folly, and the fruit of pride; or carried it in such a haughty and overbearing manner to others, as to provoke to wrath and anger; <p>or if thou hast thought evil; purposed and designed it, and contrived the scheme of doing it, though not yet put in execution; though folly is not actually committed, yet since the thought of it is rain, care should be taken to prevent it; <p>lay thine hand upon thy mouth: think again before the thing resolved on is done; as studious and thoughtful men put their hand to their mouth, when they are deeply considering any affair before them: or put a stop to the design, let it go no further; what has been thought of in the mind, let it never come out of the mouth, nor be carried into execution; stifle it in the first motion: or if this respects a foolish action done, as it also may, since it stands connected with both clauses, then the sense is, be silent; do not pretend to deny the action, nor to excuse it; nor to say one word in the defence of it; nor to lay the blame upon others; and much less to calumniate and reproach such who faithfully reprove for it; take shame to thyself in silence, and repent of the iniquity done. Aben Ezra thinks these words are said to Ithiel and Ucal; but rather, to any and everyone, to all that should hear and read these proverbs.

If thou hast had the folly to be arrogant, proud, and overbearing in conduct. Or if thou hast thought evil, lay thine hand upon thy mouth. The verb <span class="accented">zamam</span>, though possibly used in a bad sense, "to devise evil," is more suitably rendered "to meditate," "purpose;" so here it is the thought of lifting up one's self that is censured, the act and the thought being contrasted. Hast thou acted arrogantly, or even only meditated doing so, restrain yourself, keep silence (<a href="/job/21-5.htm">Job 21:5</a>; <a href="/job/40-4.htm">Job 40:4</a>). St. Jerome gives a different rendering, enforcing another lesson, "There is one who shows himself a fool after he is raised to high position; if he had had understanding, he would have laid his hand on his mouth." Septuagint, "If thou give thyself up to mirth, and stretch forth thy hand in a quarrel, thou wilt be dishonoured." Insensate mirth and a quarrelsome disposition alike lead to disgrace. St. Gregory ('Moral.,' 30:10) applies the Vulgate rendering to antichrist, "For he in truth will be lifted up on high, when he will feign that he is God. But he will appear a fool when lifted up on high, because he will fail in his very loftiness through the coming of the true Judge. But if he had understood this, he would have laid his hand on his mouth; that is, if he had foreseen his punishment, when he began to be proud, having been once fashioned aright, he would not have been raised up to the boastfulness of such great pride" (Oxford transl.). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/30.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Another proverb with the cipher 4, its first line terminating in &#1488;&#1512;&#1509;:<p>24 Four are the little things of the earth,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And yet they are quick of wit - wise:<p>25 The ants - a people not strong,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And yet they prepare in summer their food;<p>26 Conies - a people not mighty,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And yet set their dwelling on the rocks;<p>27 No king have the locusts,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And yet they go forth in rank and file, all of them together;<p>28 The lizard thou canst catch with the hands,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And yet it is in the king's palaces.<p>By the disjunctive accent, &#1488;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492;, in spite of the following word toned on the beginning, retains its ultima-toning, 18a; but here, by the conjunctive accent, the tone retrogrades to the penult., which does not elsewhere occur with this word.

The ants are called &#1506;&#1501;, and they deserve this name, for they truly form communities with well-ordered economy; but, besides, the ancients took delight in speaking of the various classes of animals as peoples and states.<p>(Note: Vid., Walter von der Vogelweide, edited by Lachmann, p. 8f.)<p>That which is said, 25b, as also <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/6-8.htm">Proverbs 6:8</a>, is not to be understood of stores laid up for the winter.
