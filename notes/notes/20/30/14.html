In every age there are monsters of ingratitude who ill-treat their parents. Many persuade themselves they are holy persons, whose hearts are full of sin, and who practise secret wickedness. There are others whose lofty pride is manifest. There have also been cruel monsters in every age. 15-17. Cruelty and covetousness are two daughters of the horseleech, that still cry, Give, give, and they are continually uneasy to themselves. Four things never are satisfied, to which these devourers are compared. Those are never rich that are always coveting. And many who have come to a bad end, have owned that their wicked courses began by despising their parents' authority. 18-20. Four things cannot be fully known. The kingdom of nature is full of marvels. The fourth is a mystery of iniquity; the cursed arts by which a vile seducer gains the affections of a female; and the arts which a vile woman uses to conceal her wickedness. 21-23 Four sorts of persons are very troublesome. Men of low origin and base spirit, who, getting authority, become tyrants. Foolish and violent men indulging in excesses. A woman of a contentious spirit and vicious habits. A servant who has obtained undue influence. Let those whom Providence has advanced from low beginnings, carefully watch against that sin which most easily besets them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Pharisee temper (compare the marginal reference). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/30.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11-14.

There follows a prayer to be kept in the truth, and to be preserved in the middle state, between poverty and riches. It is a Mashal-ode, vid., vol. i. p. 12. By the first prayer, "vanity and lies keep far from me," it is connected with the warning of <a href="/proverbs/30-6.htm">Proverbs 30:6</a>.<p>7 Two things I entreat from Thee,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Refuse them not to me before Idie.<p>8 Vanity and lies keep far away from me<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Poverty and riches give me not:<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Cause me to eat the bread which is allotted to me,<p>9 Lest in satiety Ideny,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; And say: Who is Jahve?<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; And lest, in becoming poor, Isteal,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; And profane the name of my God.<p>We begin with the settlement and explanation of the traditional punctuation. A monosyllable like &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1488; receives, if Legarmeh, always Mehuppach Legarmeh, while, on the contrary, the poly-syllable &#1488;&#1513;&#1474;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506; has Asla Legarmeh. &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1514;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503;&#1470;&#1500;&#1497;, with double Makkeph and with Gaja in the third syllable before the tone (after the Metheg-Setzung, 28), is Ben-Asher's; whereas Ben-Naphtali prefers the punctuation &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1514;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503; &#1500;&#1497; (vid., Baer's Genesis, p. 79, note 3). Also &#1508;&#1468;&#1503;&#1470;&#1488;&#1513;&#1474;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506; has (cf. &#1508;&#1468;&#1503;&#1470;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;, <a href="/proverbs/31-5.htm">Proverbs 31:5</a>) Makkeph, and on the antepenultima Gaja (vid., Thorath Emeth, p. 32). The perf. consec. &#1493;&#1499;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; has on the ult. the disjunctive Zinnor (Sarka), which always stands over the final letter; but that the ult. is also to be accented, is shown by the counter-tone Metheg, which is to be given to the first syllable. Also &#1493;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; has in correct Codd., e.g., Cod. 1294, the correct ultima toning of a perf. consec.; Kimchi in the Michlol 6b, as well as Aben Ezra in both of his Grammars, quotes only &#1493;&#1490;&#1504;&#1489;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; &#1493;&#1514;&#1508;&#1513;&#1474;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; as toned on the penult. That &#1493;&#1490;&#1504;&#1489;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; cannot be otherwise toned on account of the pausal accent, has been already remarked under 6b; the word, besides, belongs to the &#1505;&#1507;''&#1508;&#1514;&#1514;&#1497;&#1503; &#1489;&#1488;, i.e., to those which preserve their Pathach unlengthened by one of the greater disjunctives; the Athnach has certainly in the three so-called metrical books only the disjunctive form of the Zakeph of the prose books. So much as to the form of the text.<p>continued...</body></html>
