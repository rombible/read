In every age there are monsters of ingratitude who ill-treat their parents. Many persuade themselves they are holy persons, whose hearts are full of sin, and who practise secret wickedness. There are others whose lofty pride is manifest. There have also been cruel monsters in every age. 15-17. Cruelty and covetousness are two daughters of the horseleech, that still cry, Give, give, and they are continually uneasy to themselves. Four things never are satisfied, to which these devourers are compared. Those are never rich that are always coveting. And many who have come to a bad end, have owned that their wicked courses began by despising their parents' authority. 18-20. Four things cannot be fully known. The kingdom of nature is full of marvels. The fourth is a mystery of iniquity; the cursed arts by which a vile seducer gains the affections of a female; and the arts which a vile woman uses to conceal her wickedness. 21-23 Four sorts of persons are very troublesome. Men of low origin and base spirit, who, getting authority, become tyrants. Foolish and violent men indulging in excesses. A woman of a contentious spirit and vicious habits. A servant who has obtained undue influence. Let those whom Providence has advanced from low beginnings, carefully watch against that sin which most easily besets them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Odious woman - One in whom there is nothing loveable.

The sentence does not refer to an unbeloved wife, a Leah, becoming the favourite, a Rachel; the expression, "when she is married," can hardly have this sense; but the gnome speaks of a woman who has passed much of her life without love, having nothing about her attractive either in looks, attainments, or manner, and is consequently soured and ill-tempered.

The LXX. transposes the last two members of the comparison, placing the unloved woman in the fourth place as the most intolerable of all: "And if a maidservant should cast out (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;</span>, <a href="/genesis/21-10.htm">Genesis 21:10</a>) her own mistress, and a hateful woman should obtain a good husband." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/30.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The proverb of the &#8219;Alu&#770;ka is the first of the proverbs founded on the figure of an animal among the "words" of Agur. It is now followed by another of a similar character:<p>17 An eye that mocketh at his father,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And despiseth obedience to his mother:<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ravens of the brook shall pluck it out,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the young eagles shall eat it.<p>If "an eye," and not "eyes," are spoken of here, this is accounted for by the consideration that the duality of the organ falls back against the unity of the mental activity and mental expression which it serves (cf. Psychol. p. 234). As haughtiness reveals itself (<a href="/proverbs/30-13.htm">Proverbs 30:13</a>) in the action of the eyes, so is the eye also the mirror of humble subordination, and also of malicious scorn which refuses reverence and subjection to father and mother. As in German the verbs [verspotten, spotten, hhnen, hohnsprechen signifying to mock at or scorn may be used with the accus., genit., or dat., so also &#1500;&#1506;&#1490; [to deride] and &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494; [to despise] may be connected at pleasure with either an accusative object or a dative object.

The punctuation of &#1500;&#1497;&#1511;&#1492;&#1514; is more fluctuating. The word &#1500;&#1511;&#1492;&#1514; (e.g., Cod. Jaman.) may remain out of view, for the Dag. dirimens in &#1511; stands here as firmly as at <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>, cf. <a href="/psalms/45-10.htm">Psalm 45:10</a>. But it is a question whether one has to write &#1500;&#1497;&#1511;&#1468;&#1492;&#1514; with Yod quiesc.

Comm. of Jekuthil ha-Nakdans, under <a href="/genesis/47-17.htm">Genesis 47:17</a>; <a href="/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>), as it is found in Kimchi, Michlol 45a, and under &#1497;&#1511;&#1492;, and as also Norzi requires, or &#1500;&#1497;&#1511;&#1468;&#1492;&#1514; (as e.g., Cod.

Thus, regarding &#1493;&#1497;&#1500;&#1500;&#1514;, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-36.htm">Jeremiah 25:36</a>, in Michlol 87b, and under &#1497;&#1500;&#1500;.

Lwenstein translates, "the weakness of the mother." Thus after Rashi, who refers the word to &#1511;&#1492;&#1492;, to draw together, and explains it, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>, "collection;" but in the passage before us, understands it of the wrinkles on the countenance of the aged mother. Nachmani (Ramban) goes still further, giving to the word, at <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>, everywhere the meaning of weakness and frailty. Aben Ezra also, and Gersuni (Ralbag), do not go beyond the meaning of a drawing together; and the lxx, with the Aram., who all translate the word by senectus, have also &#1511;&#1492;&#1492; in the sense of to become dull, infirm (certainly not the Aethiopic lehek&#803;a, to become old, weak through old age). But Kimchi, whom the Venet. and Luther<p>(Note: Jerome translates, et qui despicit partum matris suae. To partus there separates itself to him here the signification expectatio, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>, resting on a false combination with &#1511;&#1493;&#1492;. To think of pareo, parui, paritum (Mhlau), was not yet granted to him.)<p>follow, is informed by Abulwald, skilled in the Arab., of a better: &#1497;&#1511;&#1492;&#1492; (or &#1497;&#1511;&#1468;&#1492;&#1492;, cf. &#1504;&#1510;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492;, <a href="/psalms/141-3.htm">Psalm 141:3</a>) is the Arab. wakhat, obedience (vid., above &#1497;&#1511;&#1492; under 1a). If now it is said of such a haughty, insolent eye, that the ravens of the brook (cf. <a href="/1_kings/17-4.htm">1 Kings 17:4</a>) will pluck it out, and the &#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1470;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; eat it, they, the eagle's children, the unchildlike human eye: it is only the description of the fate that is before such an one, to die a violent death, and to become a prey to the fowls of heaven (cf. e.g., <a href="/jeremiah/16-3.htm">Jeremiah 16:3</a>., and Passow's Lex. under &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3be;); and if this threatening is not always thus literally fulfilled, yet one has not on that account to render the future optatively, with Hitzig; this is a false conclusion, from a too literal interpretation, for the threatening is only to be understood after its spirit, viz., that a fearful and a dishonourable end will come to such an one. Instead of &#1497;&#1511;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492;, as Mhlau reads from the Leipzig Cod., &#1497;&#1511;&#1512;&#1493;&#1492;, with Mercha (Athias and Nissel have it with Tarcha), is to be read, for a word between Olewejored and Athnach must always contain a conjunctive accent (Thorath Emeth, p. 51; Accentuationssystem, xviii. 9). &#1506;&#1512;&#1489;&#1497;&#1470;&#1504;&#1495;&#1500; is also irregular, and instead of it &#1506;&#1512;&#1489;&#1497;&#1470;&#1504;&#1495;&#1500; is to be written, for the reason given above under <a href="/proverbs/30-16.htm">Proverbs 30:16</a> (&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;). </body></html>
