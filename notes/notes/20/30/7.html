There is a remarkable similarity between this prayer and several clauses of the Lord's prayer. If we are removed from vanity and lies; if we are interested in the pardoning love of Christ, and have him for our portion; if we walk with God, then we shall have all we can ask or think, as to spiritual things. When we consider how those who have abundance are prone to abuse the gift, and what it is to suffer want, Agur's prayer will ever be found a wise one, though seldom offered. Food convenient; what is so for one, may not be so for another; but we may be sure that our heavenly Father will supply all our need, and not suffer us to want anything good for us; and why should we wish for more?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Two things - The limitation of man's desires follows naturally upon his consciousness of the limits of his knowledge. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/30.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7-9.

The old synagogue tradition which, on the ground of the general title <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/1-1.htm">Proverbs 1:1</a>, regarded the whole Book of Proverbs as the work of Solomon, interpreted the words, "Agur the son of Jakeh," as an allegorical designation of Solomon, who appropriated the words of the To&#770;ra to the king, <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-17.htm">Deuteronomy 17:17</a>, and again rejected them, for he said: God is with me, and I shall not do it (viz., take many wives, without thereby suffering injury), Schemth rabba, c. 6. The translation of Jerome: Verba congregantis filii Vomentis, is the echo of this Jewish interpretation. One would suppose that if "Agur" were Solomon's name, "Jakeh" must be that of David; but another interpretation in Midrash Mishle renders &#1489;&#1503; ("son") as the designation of the bearer of a quality, and sees in "Agur" one who girded (&#1488;&#1490;&#1512;  equals  &#1495;&#1490;&#1512;) his loins for wisdom; and in "son of Jakeh" one free from sin (&#1495;&#1496;&#1488; &#1493;&#1506;&#1493;&#1503; &#1504;&#1511;&#1497; &#1502;&#1499;&#1500;). In the Middle Ages this mode of interpretation, which is historically and linguistically absurd, first began to prevail; for then the view was expressed by several (Aben Ezra, and Meri the Spaniard) that Agur ben Jakeh was a wise man of the time of Solomon. That of Solomon's time, they thence conclude (blind to <a href="/proverbs/25-1.htm">Proverbs 25:1</a>) that Solomon collected together these proverbs of the otherwise unknown wise man. In truth, the age of the man must remain undecided; and at all events, the time of Hezekiah is the fixed period from which, where possible, it is to be sought. The name "Agur" means the gathered (<a href="/proverbs/6-8.htm">Proverbs 6:8</a>; <a href="/proverbs/10-5.htm">Proverbs 10:5</a>), or, after the predominant meaning of the Arab. a&#770;jar, the bribed, mercede conductum; also the collector (cf. &#1497;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;, fowler); or the word might mean, perhaps, industrious in collecting (cf. 'alwak&#803;, attached to, and other examples in Mhlau, p. 36). Regarding &#1489;&#1468;&#1503;  equals  binj (usual in &#1489;&#1468;&#1503;&#1470;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;), and its relation to the Arab. ibn, vid., Genesis, p. 555. The name Jakeh is more transparent. The noun &#1497;&#1511;&#1492;&#1492;, <a href="/proverbs/30-17.htm">Proverbs 30:17</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>, means the obedient, from the verb &#1497;&#1511;&#1492;&#1468;; but, formed from this verbal stem, the form of the word would be &#1497;&#1511;&#1492;&#1468; (not &#1497;&#1511;&#1492;). The form &#1497;&#1511;&#1492; is the participial adj. from &#1497;&#1511;&#1492;, like &#1497;&#1508;&#1492; from &#1497;&#1508;&#1492;; and the Arab. wak&#803;ay, corresponding to this &#1497;&#1511;&#1492;, viii. ittak&#803;ay, to be on one's guard, particularly before God; the usual word fore piety regarded as &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;. Mhlau (p. 37) rightly sees in the proper names Eltekeh [<a href="/joshua/19-44.htm">Joshua 19:44</a>] and Eltekon [<a href="/joshua/15-59.htm">Joshua 15:59</a>] the secondary verbal stem &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1492;, which, like e.g., &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1492; (&#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1492;), &#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1489;, &#1506;&#1514;&#1491;, has originated from the reflexive, which in these proper names, supposing that &#1488;&#1500; is subj., means to take under protection; not: to give heed  equals  cavere. All these meanings are closely connected. In all these three forms - &#1497;&#1511;&#1492;&#1468;, &#1497;&#1511;&#1492;, &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1492; - the verb is a synonym of &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;; so that &#1497;&#1511;&#1492; denotes<p>(Note: According to the Lex. 'Gezer (from the Mesopotamian town of 'Geziret ibn 'Amr), the word wakihon is, in the Mesopotamian language, "the overseer of the house in which is the cross of the Christians;" and accordingly, in Muhammed's letter to the Christians of Negran, after they became subject to him, "a monk shall not be removed from his monastery, nor a presbyter from his presbyterate, (wak&#803;a&#770;htah) wala watah wakahyttah" (this will be the correct phrase), "nor an overseer from his office." The verbal stem wak&#803;-ah (&#1497;&#1511;&#1492;&#1468;) is, as it appears, Northern Semitic; the South Arabian lexicographer Neshwan ignores it (Wetzstein in Mhlau).)<p>the pious, either as taking care, &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c2;, or as keeping, i.e., observing, viz., that which is commanded by God.<p>In consequence of the accentuation, &#1492;&#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488; is the second designation of this string of proverbs, and is parallel with &#1491;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;. But that is absolutely impossible. &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488; (from &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;, to raise, viz., the voice, to begin to express) denotes the utterance, and according to the usage of the words before us, the divine utterance, the message of God revealed to the prophet and announced by him, for the most part, if not always (vid., at <a href="/isaiah/13-1.htm">Isaiah 13:1</a>), the message of God as the avenger. Accordingly Jewish interpreters (e.g., Meri and Arama) remark that &#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488; designates what follows, as &#1491;&#1489;&#1512; &#1504;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;, i.e., an utterance of the prophetic spirit. But, on the other hand, what follows begins with the confession of human weakness and short-sightedness; and, moreover, we read proverbs not of a divine but altogether of a human and even of a decaying spiritual stamp, besides distinguished from the Solomonic proverbs by this, that the I of the poet, which remains in the background, here comes to the front. This &#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488; of prophetic utterances does not at all harmonize with the following string of proverbs. It does not so harmonize on this account, because one theme does not run through these proverbs which the sing. &#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488; requires. It comes to this, that &#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488; never occurs by itself in the sense of a divine, a solemn utterance, without having some more clearly defining addition, though it should be only a demonstrative &#1492;&#1494;&#1468;&#1492; (<a href="/isaiah/14-28.htm">Isaiah 14:28</a>). But what author, whether poet or prophet, would give to his work the title of &#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;, which in itself means everything, and thus nothing! And now: the utterance - what can the article at all mean here? This question has remained unanswered by every interpreter. Ewald also sees himself constrained to clothe the naked word; he does it by reading together &#1492;&#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488; &#1504;&#1488;&#1501;, and translating the "sublime saying which he spoke." But apart from the consideration that <a href="/jeremiah/23-31.htm">Jeremiah 23:31</a> proves nothing for the use of this use of &#1504;&#1488;&#1501;, the form (&#1492;&#1490;&#1489;&#1512;) &#1504;&#1488;&#1501; is supported by <a href="/2_samuel/23-1.htm">2 Samuel 23:1</a> (cf. <a href="/proverbs/30-5.htm">Proverbs 30:5</a> with <a href="/2_samuel/22-31.htm">2 Samuel 22:31</a>); and besides, the omission of the &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, and in addition of the relative pronoun (&#1504;&#1488;&#1502;&#1493;), would be an inaccuracy not at all to be expected on the brow of this gnomology (vid., Hitzig). If we leave the altogether unsuspected &#1504;&#1488;&#1501; undisturbed, &#1492;&#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488; will be a nearer definition of the name of the author. The Midrash has a right suspicion, for it takes together Hamassa and Agur ben Jakeh, and explains: of Agur the son of Jakeh, who took upon himself the yoke of the most blessed. The Graecus Venetus comes nearer what is correct, for it translates: &#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; &#x391;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3c5;&#x3b9;&#788;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3c2; &#x399;&#787;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x39c;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;. We connect <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/31-1.htm">Proverbs 31:1</a>, where &#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1500; &#1502;&#1500;&#1498;, "Lemuel (the) king," is a linguistic impossibility, and thus, according to the accentuation lying before us, &#1502;&#1500;&#1498; &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488; also are to be connected together; thus it appears that &#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488; must be the name of a country and a people. It was Hitzig who first made this Columbus-egg to stand. But this is the case only so far as he recognised in &#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1488;&#1500; &#1502;&#1500;&#1498; &#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488; a Lemuel, the king of Massa, and recognised this Massa also in <a href="/proverbs/30-1.htm">Proverbs 30:1</a> (vid., his dissertation: Das Knigreich Massa [the kingdom of Massa], in Zeller's Theolog. Jahrbb. 1844, and his Comm.), viz., the Israelitish Massa named in <a href="/genesis/25-14.htm">Genesis 25:14</a> ( equals  <a href="/1_chronicles/1-30.htm">1 Chronicles 1:30</a>) along with Dumah and Tema. But he proceeds in a hair-splitting way, and with ingenious hypothesis, without any valid foundation. That this Dumah is the Dumat el-jendel (cf. under <a href="/isaiah/21-11.htm">Isaiah 21:11</a>) lying in the north of Nejed, near the southern frontiers of Syria, the name and the founding of which is referred by the Arabians to Dm the son of Ishmael, must be regarded as possible, and consequently Massa is certainly to be sought in Northern Arabia. But if, on the ground of <a href="/1_chronicles/4-42.htm">1 Chronicles 4:42</a>., he finds there a Simeonitic kingdom, and finds its origin in this, that the tribe of Simeon originally belonging to the ten tribes, and thus coming from the north settled in the south of Judah, and from thence in the days of Hezekiah, fleeing before the Assyrians, were driven farther and farther in a south-east direction towards Northern Arabia; on the contrary, it has been shown by Graf (The Tribe of Simeon, a contribution to the history of Israel, 1866) that Simeon never settled in the north of the Holy Land, and according to existing evidences extended their settlement from Negeb partly into the Idumean highlands, but not into the highlands of North Arabia. Hitzig thinks that there are found traces of the Massa of Agur and Lemuel in the Jewish town<p>(Note: Cf. Blau's Arab. im sechsten Jahrh. in the Deutsch. Morgl. Zeits. xxxiii. 590, and also p. 573 of the same, regarding a family of proselytes among the Jews in Taima.)<p>of &#1496;&#1497;&#1500;&#1502;&#1488;&#1505;, of Benjamin of Tudela, lying three days' journey from Chebar, and in the proper name (Arab.) Malsa&#772; (smooth), which is given to a rock between Tema and Wady el-Kora (vid., Kosegarten's Chestom. p. 143); but how notched his ingenuity here is need scarcely be shown. By means of more cautious combinations Mhlau has placed the residence of Agur and Lemuel in the Hauran mountain range, near which there is a Dumah, likewise a Tm; and in the name of the town Mismje, lying in the Lej, is probably found the Mishma which is named along with Massa, <a href="/genesis/25-14.htm">Genesis 25:14</a>; and from this that is related in <a href="/1_chronicles/5-9.htm">1 Chronicles 5:9</a>., <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-18.htm">1 Chronicles 5:18-22</a>, of warlike expeditions on the part of the tribes lying on the east of the Jordan against the Hagarenes and their allies Jetur, Nephish, and Nodab,<p>(Note: Mhlau combines Nodab with Nudbe to the south-east of Bosra; Blau (Deut. Morg. Zeit. xxv. 566), with the &#x39d;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; of Eupolemos named along with the &#x39d;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;. The Kams has Nadab as the name of a tribe.)<p>it is with certainty concluded that in the Hauran, and in the wilderness which stretches behind the Euphrates towards it, Israelitish tribes have had their abode, whose territory had been early seized by the trans-Jordanic tribes, and was held "until the captivity," <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-22.htm">1 Chronicles 5:22</a>, i.e., till the Assyrian deportation. This designation of time is almost as unfavourable to Mhlau's theory of a Massa in the Hauran, inhabited by Israelitish tribes from the other side, as the expression "to Mount Seir" (<a href="/1_chronicles/4-42.htm">1 Chronicles 4:42</a>) is to Hitzig's North Arabian Massa inhabited by Simeonites. We must leave it undecided whether Dumah and Tm, which the Toledoth of Ismael name in the neighbourhood of Massa, are the east Hauran districts now existing; or as Blau (Deut. Morgl. Zeit. xxv. 539), with Hitzig, supposes, North Arabian districts (cf. Genesis. p. 377, 4th ed.).<p>(Note: Dozy (Israeliten in Mecca, p. 89f.) connects Massa with Mansh, a pretended old name of Mecca.)<p>"Be it as it may, the contents and the language of this difficult piece almost necessarily point to a region bordering on the Syro-Arabian waste. Ziegler's view (Neue Uebers. der Denksprche Salomo's, 1791, p. 29), that Lemuel was probably an emir of an Arabian tribe in the east of Jordan, and that a wise Hebrew translated those proverbs of the emir into Hebrew, is certainly untenable, but does not depart so far from the end as may appear at the first glance" (Mhlau).<p>(Note: These German quotations with the name of Mhlau are taken from the additions to his book, which he placed at my disposal.)<p>If the text-punctuation lying before us rests on the false supposition that Massa, <a href="/proverbs/30-1.htm">Proverbs 30:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/31-1.htm">Proverbs 31:1</a>, is a generic name, and not a proper name, then certainly the question arises whether &#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488; should not be used instead of &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488;, much more &#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;, which is suggested as possible in the article "Sprche," in Herzog's Encycl. xiv. 694.
