There is a remarkable similarity between this prayer and several clauses of the Lord's prayer. If we are removed from vanity and lies; if we are interested in the pardoning love of Christ, and have him for our portion; if we walk with God, then we shall have all we can ask or think, as to spiritual things. When we consider how those who have abundance are prone to abuse the gift, and what it is to suffer want, Agur's prayer will ever be found a wise one, though seldom offered. Food convenient; what is so for one, may not be so for another; but we may be sure that our heavenly Father will supply all our need, and not suffer us to want anything good for us; and why should we wish for more?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The order of the two requests is significant.

This is the "first" request, to be preserved from sin, in general; which is a vain, lying, and deceitful thing; promising pleasure, profit, liberty, and impunity, which it does not give. Agur desires to have vain thoughts removed out of his mind, vain words from his mouth, and vain actions from his life and conversation; to have his eyes turned from beholding vanity, and his feet from walking in it; and his affections taken off from the vain things of the world, the lusts, pleasures, profits, and honours of it; as well as to be kept from all errors and false doctrines, which are lies in hypocrisy; with which men that lie in wait to deceive would, if it were possible, deceive the very elect: Agur conscious of his own weakness, and proneness to evil, desires the Lord would not lead him into temptation, but deliver him from all evil, doctrinal and practical. Some understand this of the forgiveness of sin; which is sometimes expressed by a putting or removing it away, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-13.htm">2 Samuel 7:13</a>, <a href="/psalms/103-12.htm">Psalm 103:12</a>; <p>give me neither poverty nor riches; this is the "second" request, not to be extremely poor nor too rich; but to be in a middle state between both, neither rich nor poor; which Horace (b) calls the golden mean, and which Agur wisely judged to be the happiest state; most free from care, least liable to temptation, and the best situation to serve the Lord in: a like wish was made by Theognis (c), I neither love to be rich, <p>"nor desire it; but to live on a little, having no evil;'' <p>so Martial (d). Both riches and poverty are of God; men are rich or poor, as the Lord pleases; he suffers poverty in some, and gives riches to others: Agur deprecates both, as having their separate, peculiar, snares and temptations; though no doubt this request was made with submission to the will of God; and not as considering either of them as evils in themselves, but as they might be attended with bad consequences, and what is next mentioned being more eligible; <p>feed me with food convenient for me; not merely what was agreeable to his palate, suitable to his constitution, and sufficient for nature; nor for him personally, but for his family also; and what was proper and suitable to the condition and circumstances in which he was, and to the rank and quality he held, whether in a more private or in a more public capacity. Some render it, "the food of my allowance" (e); what is allotted and appointed for me It seems to be the same which Job calls his "necessary food", and Christ "our daily bread": it takes in both food and raiment, which having, men should be contented with; see <a href="/job/23-12.htm">Job 23:12</a>. The allusion seems to be to the stated measure of food allowed to servants by the day, or rather by the month, called "demensum", and which was but small and scanty (f); yet with this Agur could be content. <p>(b) Camin. l. 2.

In the latter, bread for the needs of the coming day is meant; in our passage it is more indefinite, a casting one's self on the Divine love, in readiness to take what that love assigns. "Having food and covering," says St. Paul (<a href="/1_timothy/6-8.htm">1 Timothy 6:8</a>), "we shall be therewith content."

So here Agur finds the reason why in divine things he has failed to attain unto satisfying intelligence, not in the ignorance and inability common to all men - he appears to himself as not a man at all, but as an irrational beast, and he misses in himself the understanding which a man properly might have and ought to have. The &#1502;&#1503; of &#1502;&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; is not the partitive, like <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/44-11.htm">Isaiah 44:11</a>, not the usual comparative: than any one (Bttcher), which ought to be expressed by &#1502;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, but it is the negative, as <a href="/isaiah/52-14.htm">Isaiah 52:14</a>; Fleischer: rudior ego sum quam ut homo appeller, or: brutus ego, hominis non similis. Regarding &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;, vid., under <a href="/proverbs/12-1.htm">Proverbs 12:1</a>.<p>(Note: According to the Arab. &#1489;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512; is not a beast as grazing, but as dropping stercus (ba'r, camel's or sheep's droppings); to the R. &#1489;&#1512;, Mhlau rightly gives the meanings of separating, whence are derived the meanings of grazing as well as of removing (cleansing) (cf. Pers. thak karadn, to make clean  equals  to make clean house, tabula rasa).)<p><a href="/proverbs/30-3.htm">Proverbs 30:3</a> now says that he went into no school of wisdom, and for that reason in his wrestling after knowledge could attain to nothing, because the necessary conditions to this were wanting to him. But then the question arises: Why this complaint? He must first go to school in order to obtain, according to the word "To him who hath is given," that for which he strove. Thus &#1500;&#1502;&#1491;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; refers to learning in the midst of wrestling; but &#1500;&#1502;&#1491;, spiritually understood, signifies the acquiring of a kennens [knowledge] or knnens [knowledge  equals  ability]: he has not brought it out from the deep point of his condition of knowledge to make wisdom his own, so that he cannot adjudge to himself knowledge of the all-holy God (for this knowledge is the kernel and the star of true wisdom). If we read 3b &#1500;&#1488; &#1488;&#1491;&#1506;, this would be synchronistic, nesciebam, with &#1500;&#1502;&#1491;&#1514;&#1497; standing on the same line.
