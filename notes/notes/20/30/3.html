The knowledge of the all holy God was beyond his grasp (<a href="/job/11-7.htm">Job 11:7</a>, etc.). Theology is a higher science than metaphysics, and cannot be reached by that ladder.

The construction of the verse, he remarks, is not understood by any interpreter. It is not, however, so cross, - for, understood as Hitzig thinks it ought to be, the author should have expressed the subject by &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492; &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1490;&#1497;&#1491;, - but is simple as the order of the words and the verbal form require it. The oath is, after <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/5-1.htm">Leviticus 5:1</a>, that of the judge who adjures the partner of the thief by God to tell the truth; but he conceals it, and burdens his soul with a crime worthy of death, for from a concealer he becomes in addition a perjured man. </body></html>
