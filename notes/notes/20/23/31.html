Those that would be kept from sin, must keep from all the beginnings of it, and fear coming within reach of its allurements. Foresee the punishment, what it will at last end in, if repentance prevent not. It makes men quarrel. Drunkards wilfully make woe and sorrow for themselves. It makes men impure and insolent. The tongue grows unruly; the heart utters things contrary to reason, religion, and common civility. It stupifies and besots men. They are in danger of death, of damnation; as much exposed as if they slept upon the top of a mast, yet feel secure. They fear no peril when the terrors of the Lord are before them; they feel no pain when the judgments of God are actually upon them. So lost is a drunkard to virtue and honour, so wretchedly is his conscience seared, that he is not ashamed to say, I will seek it again. With good reason we were bid to stop before the beginning. Who that has common sense would contract a habit, or sell himself to a sin, which tends to such guilt and misery, and exposes a man every day to the danger of dying insensible, and awaking in hell? Wisdom seems in these chapters to take up the discourse as at the beginning of the book.

The author of this appendix may have met with <a href="/proverbs/23-23.htm">Proverbs 23:23</a> and <a href="/proverbs/23-24.htm">Proverbs 23:24</a> (although here also his style, as conformed to that of <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/1-9.htm">Proverbs 1:9</a>, is noticeable, cf. 23b with <a href="/proverbs/1-2.htm">Proverbs 1:2</a>), but <a href="/proverbs/23-22.htm">Proverbs 23:22</a> and <a href="/proverbs/23-25.htm">Proverbs 23:25</a> are the form which he has given to them.<p>Thus <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/23-22.htm">Proverbs 23:22-25</a> are a whole: - <p>22 Hearken to thy father, to him who hath begotten thee,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And despise not thy mother when she has grown old.<p>23 Buy the truth, and sell it not,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wisdom and discipline and understanding.<p>24 The father of a righteous man rejoiceth greatly;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (And) he that is the father of a wise man - he will rejoice.<p>25 Let thy father and thy mother be glad;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And her that bare thee exult.<p>The octastich begins with a call to childlike obedience, for &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; &#1500;, to listen to any one, is equivalent to, to obey him, e.g., <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/81-9.htm">Psalm 81:9</a>, <a href="/psalms/81-14.htm">Psalm 81:14</a> (cf. "hearken to his voice," <a href="/psalms/95-7.htm">Psalm 95:7</a>). &#1494;&#1492; &#1497;&#1500;&#1491;&#1498; is a relative clause (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-18.htm">Deuteronomy 32:18</a>, without &#1494;&#1492; or &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;), according to which it is rightly accentuated (cf. on the contrary, <a href="/psalms/78-54.htm">Psalm 78:54</a>). 22b, strictly taken, is not to be translated neve contemne cum senuerit matrem tuam (Fleischer), but cum senuerit mater tua, for the logical object to &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494; is attracted as subj. of &#1494;&#1511;&#1504;&#1492; (Hitzig). There now follows the exhortation comprehending all, and formed after <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/4-7.htm">Proverbs 4:7</a>, to buy wisdom, i.e., to shun no expense, no effort, no privation, in order to attain to the possession of wisdom; and not to sell it, i.e., not to place it over against any earthly possession, worldly gain, sensual enjoyment; not to let it be taken away by any intimidation, argued away by false reasoning, or prevailed against by enticements into the way of vice, and not to become unfaithful to it by swimming with the great stream (<a href="/exodus/23-2.htm">Exodus 23:2</a>); for truth, &#1488;&#1502;&#1514;, is that which endures and proves itself in all spheres, the moral as well as the intellectual. In 23b, in like manner as <a href="/proverbs/1-3.htm">Proverbs 1:3</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/22-4.htm">Proverbs 22:4</a>, a threefold object is given to &#1511;&#1504;&#1492; instead of &#1488;&#1502;&#1514;: there are three properties which are peculiar to truth, the three powers which handle it: &#1495;&#1499;&#1502;&#1492; is knowledge solid, pressing into the essence of things; &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1512; is moral culture; and &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492; the central faculty of proving and distinguishing (vid., <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/1-3.htm">Proverbs 1:3-5</a>). Now <a href="/proverbs/23-24.htm">Proverbs 23:24</a> says what consequences are for the parents when the son, according to the exhortation of <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/23-23.htm">Proverbs 23:23</a>, makes truth his aim, to which all is subordinated. Because in &#1488;&#1502;&#1514; the ideas of practical and theoretical truth are inter-connected. &#1510;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1511; and &#1495;&#1499;&#1501; are also here parallel to one another. The Cheth&#305;&#770;b of 24a is &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1500; &#1497;&#1490;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;, which Schultens finds tenable in view of (Arab.) jal, fut jaju&#770;lu (to turn round; Heb. to turn oneself for joy) but the Heb. usus loq. knows elsewhere only &#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500; &#1497;&#1490;&#1497;&#1500;, as the Ker&#305;&#770; corrects. The lxx, misled by the Cheth&#305;&#770;b, translates &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; (incorrect &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;), i.e., &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1500; &#1497;&#1490;&#1491;&#1468;&#1500;. In 24b, &#1493;&#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1495; is of the nature of a pred. of the conclusion (cf. <a href="/genesis/22-24.htm">Genesis 22:24</a>; <a href="/psalms/115-7.htm">Psalm 115:7</a>), as if the sentence were: has one begotten a wise man, then (cf. <a href="/proverbs/17-21.htm">Proverbs 17:21</a>) he has joy of him; but the Ker&#305;&#770; effaces this Vav apodosis, and assigns it to &#1497;&#1493;&#1500;&#1491; as Vav copul. - an unnecessary mingling of the syntactically possible, more emphatic expression. This proverbial whole now rounds itself off in <a href="/proverbs/23-25.htm">Proverbs 23:25</a> by a reference to <a href="/proverbs/23-22.htm">Proverbs 23:22</a> - the Optative here corresponding to the Impr. and Prohib. there: let thy father and thy mother rejoice (lxx &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;), and let her that bare thee exult (here where it is possible the Optat. form &#1493;&#1514;&#1490;&#1500;). </body></html>
