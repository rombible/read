Those that would be kept from sin, must keep from all the beginnings of it, and fear coming within reach of its allurements. Foresee the punishment, what it will at last end in, if repentance prevent not. It makes men quarrel. Drunkards wilfully make woe and sorrow for themselves. It makes men impure and insolent. The tongue grows unruly; the heart utters things contrary to reason, religion, and common civility. It stupifies and besots men. They are in danger of death, of damnation; as much exposed as if they slept upon the top of a mast, yet feel secure. They fear no peril when the terrors of the Lord are before them; they feel no pain when the judgments of God are actually upon them. So lost is a drunkard to virtue and honour, so wretchedly is his conscience seared, that he is not ashamed to say, I will seek it again. With good reason we were bid to stop before the beginning. Who that has common sense would contract a habit, or sell himself to a sin, which tends to such guilt and misery, and exposes a man every day to the danger of dying insensible, and awaking in hell? Wisdom seems in these chapters to take up the discourse as at the beginning of the book. They must be considered as the words of Christ to the sinner.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Adder - Said to be the Cerastes, or horned snake.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/23.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>33, 34.

Being inflamed with wine, shall look upon women, other men's wives, and lust after them; or harlots, whom seeking after or meeting with, when in their cups, are drawn into their embraces; excess of wine leads to whoredom (w). So Aben Ezra supplies the word "women", and Jarchi interprets it to this sense; but the Targum renders it, "strange things"; and so many others: a drunken man, through the lunges and vapours that ascend into his brain, fancies he sees strange sights; he sees things double; imagines that he sees trees walk, and many such like absurd and monstrous things; <p>and thine heart shall utter perverse things; or the mouth, from the abundance of the heart, and imagination of it, shall utter things contrary to sense and reason, contrary to truth and righteousness, contrary to chastity and good manners, contrary to their own honour and credit, contrary to God and men; the mouth then utters all that is in the heart, which it at other times conceals. It may have a particular respect to the unchaste, filthy, and obscene words, uttered to strange women, into whose company men fall when in liquor. <p>(w) "Vina parant animos Veneri", Ovid. de Arte Amandi, l. 1.<a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/23.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Thy <span class="cverse3">{o}</span> eyes shall behold strange women, and thy heart shall utter perverse things.</span><p>(o) That is, drunkenness will bring you to whoredom.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/23.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">33</span>. <span class="ital">strange</span> women] This rendering, which is retained in R.V. marg.

In this case the writer intends to denote the fantastic, often dreadful, images produced on the brain by the feverish condition of the inebriated. But the often denounced connection between drunkenness and incontinence, the constant reference to "strange women" in this book, and the general consensus of the versions, lead one to uphold the rendering of the Authorized Version. It seems, too, somewhat meagre to note these illusions as one of the terrible effects of intemperance, omitting all mention of the unbridling of lust, when the eyes look out for and rove after unchaste women. <span class="cmt_word">Thine heart shall utter perverse things</span> (comp <a href="/proverbs/15-28.htm">Proverbs 15:28</a>; <a href="/matthew/15-19.htm">Matthew 15:19</a>). The drunkard's notions are distorted, and his words partake of the same character; he confuses right and wrong; he says things which he would never speak if he were in full possession of his senses.

What, in chap. 1-9, extended discourses and representations exhibited to the youth is here repeated in miniature pictures. It is the teacher of wisdom, but by him Wisdom herself, who speaks:<p>26 Give me, my son, thine heart;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And let thine eyes delight in my ways.<p>27 For the harlot is a deep ditch,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the strange woman a narrow pit.<p>28 Yea, she lieth in wait like a robber,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And multiplieth the faithless among men<p>We have retained Luther's beautiful rendering of <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/23-26.htm">Proverbs 23:26</a>,<p>(Note: The right punctuation of 26a is &#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492;&#1470;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497; &#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1498;, as it is found in the editions: Ven. 1615; Basel 1619; and in those of Norzi and Michaelis.)<p>in which this proverb, as a warning word of heavenly wisdom and of divine love, has become dear to us. It follows, as Symmachus and the Venet., the Cheth&#305;&#770;b &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1510;&#1504;&#1492; (for &#1514;&#1512;&#1510;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492;, like <a href="/exodus/2-16.htm">Exodus 2:16</a>; <a href="/job/5-12.htm">Job 5:12</a>), the stylistic appropriateness of which proceeds from <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/16-7.htm">Proverbs 16:7</a>, as on the other hand the Ker&#305;&#770; &#1514;&#1468;&#1510;&#1468;&#1512;&#1504;&#1492; (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/14-27.htm">1 Samuel 14:27</a>) is supported by <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/22-12.htm">Proverbs 22:12</a>, cf. <a href="/proverbs/5-2.htm">Proverbs 5:2</a>. But the correction is unnecessary, and the Cheth&#305;&#770;b sounds more affectionate, hence it is with right defended by Hitzig. The ways of wisdom are ways of correction, and particularly of chastity, thus placed over against "the ways of the harlot," <a href="/proverbs/7-24.htm">Proverbs 7:24</a>. Accordingly the exhortation, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/23-26.htm">Proverbs 23:26</a>, verifies itself; warning, by <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/23-27.htm">Proverbs 23:27</a>, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/22-14.htm">Proverbs 22:14</a>, where &#1506;&#1502;&#1511;&#1468;&#1492; was written, here as at <a href="//biblehub.com/job/12-22.htm">Job 12:22</a>, with the long vowel &#1506;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511;&#1492; (&#1506;&#1502;&#1511;&#1492;). &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512; &#1510;&#1512;&#1492; interchanges with &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1492; &#1506;&#1502;&#1493;&#1511;&#1492;, and means, not the fountain of sorrow (Lwenstein), but the narrow pit. &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512; is fem. gen., <a href="/proverbs/26-21.htm">Proverbs 26:21</a>., and &#1510;&#1512; means narrow, like troit (old French, estreit), from strictus. The figure has, after <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/22-14.htm">Proverbs 22:14</a>, the mouth of the harlot in view. Whoever is enticed by her syren voice falls into a deep ditch, into a pit with a narrow mouth, into which one can more easily enter than escape from. <a href="/proverbs/23-28.htm">Proverbs 23:28</a> says that it is the artifice of the harlot which draws a man into such depth of wickedness and guilt. With &#1488;&#1507;, which, as at <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/5-29.htm">Judges 5:29</a>, belongs not to &#1492;&#1497;&#1488; but to the whole sentence, the picture of terror is completed. The verb &#1495;&#1514;&#1507; (whence Arab. h&#803;ataf, death, natural death) means to snatch away. If we take &#1495;&#1514;&#1507; as abstr.: a snatching away, then it would here stand elliptically for &#1495;&#1514;&#1507; (&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;) &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, which in itself is improbable (vid., <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/7-22.htm">Proverbs 7:22</a>, &#1506;&#1499;&#1505;) and also unnecessary, since, as &#1502;&#1500;&#1498;, &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;, &#1492;&#1500;&#1498;, etc. show, such abstracta can pass immediately into concreta, so that &#1495;&#1514;&#1507; thus means the person who snatches away, i.e., the street robber, latro (cf. &#1495;&#1496;&#1507; .fc(, Arab. khat&#803;af, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/10-9.htm">Psalm 10:9</a>, rightly explained by Kimchi as cogn.). In 28b, &#1514;&#1493;&#1505;&#1497;&#1507; cannot mean abripit (as lxx, Theodotion, and Jerome suppose), for which the word &#1514;&#1468;&#1505;&#1508;&#1468;&#1492; (&#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1505;&#1507;) would have been used.<p>(Note: The Targ. translates 28b (here free from the influence of the Peshito) in the Syro-Palestinian idiom by &#1493;&#1510;&#1488;&#1491; &#1488;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488; &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;, i.e., she seizes thoughtless sons.)<p>But this verbal idea does not harmonize with the connection; &#1514;&#1493;&#1505;&#1497;&#1507; means, as always, addit (auget), and that here in the sense of multiplicat. The same thing may be said of &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1490;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; as is said (<a href="/proverbs/11-15.htm">Proverbs 11:15</a>) of &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1511;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501;. Hitzig's objection, "&#1492;&#1493;&#1505;&#1497;&#1507;, to multiply, with the accusative of the person, is not at all used," is set aside by <a href="/proverbs/19-4.htm">Proverbs 19:4</a>. But we may translate: the faithless, or: the breach of faith she increases. Yet it always remains a question whether &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1491;&#1501; is dependent on &#1489;&#1493;&#1490;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;, as <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:9</a>, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-3.htm">2 Samuel 23:3</a>, on the verb of ruling (Hitzig), or whether, as frequently &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1491;&#1501;, e.g., <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/78-60.htm">Psalm 78:60</a>, it means inter homines (thus most interpreters). Uncleanness leads to faithlessness of manifold kinds: it makes not only the husband unfaithful to his wife, but also the son to his parents, the scholar to his teacher and pastor, the servant (cf. the case of Potiphar's wife) to his master. The adulteress, inasmuch as she entices now one and now another into her net, increases the number of those who are faithless towards men. But are they not, above all, faithless towards God? We are of opinion that not &#1489;&#1493;&#1490;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;, but &#1514;&#1493;&#1505;&#1497;&#1507;, has its complement in &#1489;&#1488;&#1491;&#1501;, and needs it: the adulteress increases the faithless among men, she makes faithlessness of manifold kinds common in human society. According to this, also, it is accentuated; &#1493;&#1489;&#1493;&#1490;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; is placed as object by Mugrasch, and &#1489;&#1488;&#1491;&#1501; is connected by Mercha with &#1514;&#1493;&#1505;&#1497;&#1507;. </body></html>
