Here we have an earnest call to young people, to attend to the advice of their godly parents. If the heart be guided, the steps will be guided. Buy the truth, and sell it not; be willing to part with any thing for it. Do not part with it for pleasures, honours, riches, or any thing in this world. The heart is what the great God requires. We must not think to divide the heart between God and the world; he will have all or none. Look to the rule of God's word, the conduct of his providence, and the good examples of his people. Particular cautions are given against sins most destructive to wisdom and grace in the soul. It is really a shame to make a god of the belly. Drunkenness stupifies men, and then all goes to ruin. Licentiousness takes away the heart that should be given to God. Take heed of any approaches toward this sin, it is very hard to retreat from it. It bewitches men to their ruin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The three forms of evil that destroy reputation and tempt to waste are brought together.<p>Drowsiness - Specially the drunken sleep, heavy and confused.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/23.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21. drowsiness&#8212;the dreamy sleep of the slothful.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/proverbs/23.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Drowsiness; </span> immoderate sleep and idleness, which is a ready a way to poverty as gluttony or drunkenness is. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/proverbs/23.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty,....

The Vulgate still harps on the same string as in the previous verse, "Those who waste time in drinking, and who give picnics (<span class="accented">dantes symbola</span>), shall be ruined, and semnolence small clothe with rags." The LXX. introduces a new idea which the Hebrew does not warrant, "For every drunkard and whoremonger shall be poor, and every sluggard shall clothe himself with tatters and rags." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/23.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The following proverb passes from the educator to the pupil:<p>15 My son, if thine heart becometh wise,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My heart also in return will rejoice;<p>16 And my reins will exult<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If thy lips speak right things.<p>Wisdom is inborn in no one. A true Arab. proverb says, "The wise knows how the fool feels, for he himself was also once a fool;"<p>(Note: The second part of the saying is, "But a fool knows not how a wise man feels, for he has never been a wise man."
