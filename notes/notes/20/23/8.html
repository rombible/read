Do not make thyself burdensome to any, especially those not sincere. When we are called by God to his feast, and to let our souls delight themselves, Isa 25:6; 55:2, we may safely partake of the Bread of life. 9. It is our duty to take all fit occasions to speak of Divine things; but if what a wise man says will not be heard, let him hold his peace. 10,11.

Some think that by the "sweet words" are meant the conversation at table with which you have endeavoured to amuse your host - the witty sayings, enigmas, and apothegms, which entered so largely into the programme of a good talker.

The fut. &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1503; clothes the admonition in the form of a wish or counsel; the infin. intens. &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503; makes it urgent: consider well him whom thou hast before thee, viz., that he is not thine equal, but one higher, who can destroy thee as well as be useful to thee. With &#1493;&#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1514;&#1468; the jussive construction begun by &#1514;&#1489;&#1497;&#1503; is continued. Zckler and Dchsel, after Ewald and Hitzig, translate incorrectly: thou puttest..., the perf. consec. after an imperf., or, which is the same thing, a fut. meant optatively (e.g., <a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a> with &#1500;&#1488;, and also <a href="/leviticus/19-34.htm">Leviticus 19:34</a> without &#1500;&#1488;) continues the exhortation; to be thus understood, the author ought to have used the expression &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503; &#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1514;&#1468; and not &#1493;&#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1514; &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1497;&#1503;. Rightly Luther: "and put a knife to thy throat," but continuing: "wilt thou preserve thy life," herein caught in the same mistake of the idea with Jerome, the Syr., and Targ., to which &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; here separates itself. &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503; (&#1505;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503;) (Arab. with the assimilated a sikk&#305;&#770;n, plur. seka&#770;k&#305;&#770;n, whence seka&#770;k&#305;&#770;ni, cutler) designates a knife (R. &#1505;&#1498; &#1513;&#1498;, to stick, vid., at <a href="/isaiah/9-10.htm">Isaiah 9:10</a>). &#1500;&#1493;&#1506;, from &#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;, to devour, is the throat; the word in Aram. signifies only the cheek, while Lagarde seeks to interpret &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1506;&#1498; infinitively in the sense of (Arab.) bwlw'ak, if thou longest for (from wl'a); but that would make 2b a tautology. The verb &#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506; (cf. Arab. l'al', to pant for) shows for the substantive the same primary meaning as glutus from glutire, which was then transferred from the inner organ of swallowing (Kimchi, &#1489;&#1497;&#1514; &#1492;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497;&#1506;&#1492;, Parchon; &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1496;, aesophagus) to the external. "Put a knife to thy throat, is a proverbial expression, like our: the knife stands at his throat; the poet means to say: restrain thy too eager desire by means of the strongest threatening of danger - threaten as it were death to it" (Fleischer). In &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;, &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; means, as at <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/13-2.htm">Proverbs 13:2</a>, desire, and that desire of eating, as at <a href="/proverbs/6-30.htm">Proverbs 6:30</a>. Rightly Rashi: if thou art greedy with hunger, if thou art a glutton; cf. Sir. 34:12 (31:12), "If thou sittest at a great table, then open not widely thy throat (&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;), and say not: There is certainly much on it!" The knife thus denotes the restraining and moderating of too good an appetite.<p>In 3a the punctuation fluctuates between &#1514;&#1514;&#1488;&#1493; (Michlol 131a) and &#1514;&#1514;&#1488;&#1493;; the latter is found in Cod. 1294, the Erfurt 2 and 3, the Cod. Jaman., and thus it is also to be written at <a href="/proverbs/23-6.htm">Proverbs 23:6</a> and <a href="/proverbs/24-1.htm">Proverbs 24:1</a>; &#1493;&#1497;&#1514;&#1488;&#1493;, <a href="/1_chronicles/11-17.htm">1 Chronicles 11:17</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/45-12.htm">Psalm 45:12</a>, Codd. and older Edd. (e.g., Complut. 1517, Ven. 1515, 1521) write with Pathach. &#1502;&#1496;&#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, from &#1496;&#1506;&#1501;, signifies savoury dishes, dainties, like (Arab.) dhwa&#770;kt, from dha&#770;k (to taste, to relish); cf. sapores, from sapere, in the proverb: the tit-bits of the king burn the lips (vid., Fleischer, Ali's Hundred Proverbs, etc., pp. 71, 104). With &#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; begins, as at <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/3-29.htm">Proverbs 3:29</a>, a conditioning clause: since it is, indeed, the bread of deceit (the connection like &#1506;&#1491;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1495;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="/proverbs/21-28.htm">Proverbs 21:28</a>), food which, as it were, deceives him who eats it, i.e., appears to secure for him the lasting favour of princes, and often enough herein deceives him; cf. the proverb by Burckhardt and Meidani: whoever eats of the sultan's soup burns his lips, even though it may be after a length of time (Fleischer). One must come near to a king, says Calovius, hitting the meaning of the proverb, as to a fire: not too near, lest he be burned; nor too remote, so that he may be warmed therewith. </body></html>
