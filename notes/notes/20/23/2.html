Refrain from too much talk at the table; give not too loose to thy tongue, but bridle it, considering in whose presence thou art; do not use too much freedom, either with the ruler or fellow guests; which, when persons have ate and drank well, they are too apt to do, and sometimes say things offensive to one or the other; it is good for a man to be upon his guard; see <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:2</a>. Or restrain thine appetite; deny thyself of some things agreeable, that would lead thee to what might be hurtful, at least if indulged to excess: put as it were a knife unto thine appetite, and mortify it; which is the same as cutting off a right hand, or plucking out a right eye <a href="/matthew/5-29.htm">Matthew 5:29</a>. Or while thou art at such a table, at such a sumptuous entertainment, consider thyself as in danger, as if thou hadst a knife at thy throat; and shouldest thou be too free with the food or liquor, it would be as it were cutting thine own throat; <p>if thou be a man given to appetite; there is then the more danger; and therefore such a person should be doubly on his guard, since he is in the way of temptation to that he is naturally inclined to. Or, "if thou art master of appetite" (r): so the Targum, <p>"if thou art master of thy soul;'' <p>if thou hast power over it, and the command of it, and canst restrain it with ease; to which agrees the Vulgate Latin version: but the former sense is more agreeable to the Hebrew idiom. <p>(r)  "dominus animae", Vatablus, Mercerus, Michaelis. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/23.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{b}</span> And put a knife to thy throat, if thou <i>art</i> a man given to appetite.</span><p>(b) Bridle your appetite, as if by force and violence.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/23.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2</span>. <span class="ital">put a knife</span>] i.e. Restrain forcibly thy appetite as with a knife held to thy throat.

Restrain thyself by the strongest measures, convince thyself that thou art in the utmost peril, if thou art a glutton or wine bibber (Ecclus. 34 [31]:12). The LXX. gives a different turn to the injunction, "And apply (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;</span>) thy hand, knowing that it behoves thee to prepare such things." This is like the warning of Siracides, in the chapter quoted above, where the disciple is admonished not to attend the banquets of rich men, lest he should be tempted to vie with them, and thus ruin himself by attempting to return their civilities in the same lavish manner. The earlier commentators have used the above verses as a lesson concerning the due and reverent partaking of the Holy Communion, thus: "When you approach the table of Christ, consider diligently what is represented by the elements before you, and have discernment and faith, lest you eat and drink unworthily; and after communicating walk warily, mortify all evil desires, live as in the presence of the Lord Jesus, the Giver of the feast." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/22.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Another tetrastich follows:<p>24 Have no intercourse with an angry man,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And with a furious man go thou not;<p>25 Lest thou adopt his ways,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And bring destruction upon thy soul.<p>The Piel &#1512;&#1506;&#1492;, <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/14-20.htm">Judges 14:20</a>, signifies to make or choose any one as a friend or companion (&#1512;&#1506;&#1492;, &#1512;&#1506;); the Hithpa. &#1492;&#1514;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492; (cf. at <a href="/proverbs/18-24.htm">Proverbs 18:24</a>), to take to oneself (for oneself) any one as a friend, or to converse with one; &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1514;&#1468;&#1514;&#1512;&#1506; sounds like &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1506;, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a>, with Pathach of the closed syllable from the apocope.

This &#1489;&#1493;&#1488; &#1488;&#1514; is not a trace of a more recent period of the language. Also &#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1500;&#1507;, discas, cannot be an equivalent for it: Heb. poetry has at all times made use of Aramaisms as elegancies. &#1488;&#1500;&#1507;, Arab. &#1488;&#1500;&#1507;, &#1497;&#1500;&#1507;, Arab. a&#770;lifa, signifies to be entrusted with anything  equals  to learn (Piel &#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1507;, to teach, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/15-15.htm">Job 15:15</a>, and in Elihu's speeches), or also to become confidential with one (whence &#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507;, companion, confidant, <a href="/proverbs/2-17.htm">Proverbs 2:17</a>); this &#1488;&#1500;&#1507; is never a Heb. prose word; the bibl. &#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507; is only used at a later period in the sense of teacher. &#1488;&#1512;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; .reh are the ways, the conduct (<a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/2-20.htm">Proverbs 2:20</a>, etc.), or manner of life (<a href="/proverbs/1-19.htm">Proverbs 1:19</a>) which any one enters upon and follows out, thus manners as well as lot, condition. In the phrase "to bring destruction," &#1500;&#1511;&#1495; is used as in our phrase Schaden nehmen [to suffer injury]; the ancient language also represented the forced entrance of one into a state as a being laid hold on, e.g., <a href="//biblehub.com/job/18-20.htm">Job 18:20</a>, cf. <a href="/isaiah/13-8.htm">Isaiah 13:8</a>; here &#1502;&#1493;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473; is not merely equivalent to danger (Ewald, falsely: that thou takest not danger for thy soul), but is equivalent to destruction, sin itself is a snare (<a href="/proverbs/29-6.htm">Proverbs 29:6</a>); to bring a snare for oneself is equivalent to suffer from being ensnared. Whosoever comes into a near relation with a passionate, furious, man, easily accommodates himself to his manners, and, hurried forward by him and like him to outbreaks of anger, which does that which is not right before God, falls into ruinous complications. </body></html>
