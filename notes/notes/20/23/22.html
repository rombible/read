Thus Solomon twice urges the same consideration, as a powerful argument to prevail with all children, that are not void of natural affection, to labour to be wise and good, that so they may rejoice the hearts of their parents, to whom they are under such high and indelible obligations.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/23.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>23:19-28 The gracious Saviour who purchased pardon and peace for his people, with all the affection of a tender parent, counsels us to hear and be wise, and is ready to guide our hearts in his way. Here we have an earnest call to young people, to attend to the advice of their godly parents. If the heart be guided, the steps will be guided. Buy the truth, and sell it not; be willing to part with any thing for it. Do not part with it for pleasures, honours, riches, or any thing in this world. The heart is what the great God requires. We must not think to divide the heart between God and the world; he will have all or none. Look to the rule of God's word, the conduct of his providence, and the good examples of his people. Particular cautions are given against sins most destructive to wisdom and grace in the soul. It is really a shame to make a god of the belly. Drunkenness stupifies men, and then all goes to ruin. Licentiousness takes away the heart that should be given to God. Take heed of any approaches toward this sin, it is very hard to retreat from it. It bewitches men to their ruin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The three forms of evil that destroy reputation and tempt to waste are brought together.<p>Drowsiness - Specially the drunken sleep, heavy and confused.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/23.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22.

A true Arab. proverb says, "The wise knows how the fool feels, for he himself was also once a fool;"<p>(Note: The second part of the saying is, "But a fool knows not how a wise man feels, for he has never been a wise man."
