The former is a sign of the latter, and commonly go together, and are both abominable to the Lord; see <a href="/psalms/101-5.htm">Psalm 101:5</a>. A man that looks above others, and with disdain upon them, shows that pride reigns in him, and swells his mind with a vain opinion of himself; this may be observed in every self-righteous man; the parable of the Pharisee and publican is a comment upon it; sometimes there may be a proud heart under a disguise of humility; but the pride of the heart is often discovered by the look of the eyes. It may be rendered, "the elevation of the eyes, and the enlargement of the heart" (p); but not to be understood in a good sense, of the lifting up of the eyes in prayer to God, with faith and fear; nor of the enlargement of the heart with solid knowledge and wisdom, such as Solomon had; but in a bad sense, of the lofty looks and haughtiness of man towards his fellow creatures, and of his unbounded desires after filthy lucre or sinful lusts: the Targum renders it, <p>"the swelling of the heart,'' <p>with pride and vanity; <p>and the ploughing of the wicked is sin; taken literally; not that it is so in itself; for it is a most useful invention, and exceeding beneficial to mankind, and is to be ascribed to God himself; and of this the Heathens are so sensible, that they have a deity to whom they attribute it, and whom they call Ceres (q), from  to plough; it only denotes that all the civil actions of a wicked man, one being put for all, are attended with sin; he sins in all he does. Or, metaphorically, for his schemes, contrivances, and projects, which are the ploughing of his mind; these are all sinful, or tend to that which is so. Some understand this particularly of his high look and proud heart, which are his ploughing and his sin; Ben Melech; and others of his ploughing, or persecuting and oppressing, the poor. The word is sometimes used for a lamp or light, and is so rendered here by some, "the light of the wicked is sin" (r); their outward happiness and prosperity leads them into sin, involves them in guilt, and so brings them to ruin and destruction: and this way go the Targum: Septuagint, Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and Arabic versions. <p>(p)    "elatio oculorum et latitudo cordis", Piscator, Michaelis, Cocceius, Schultens.

But it is best to make the whole verse one idea, as in the Authorized Version. The lifting of the eyes is a term implying pride, as shown in supercilious looks, as if other people were of inferior clay and not worthy of notice. So we have "haughty eyes" in <a href="/proverbs/6-17.htm">Proverbs 6:17</a> (where see note); and in <a href="/proverbs/30-13.htm">Proverbs 30:13</a> we read, "There is a generation, oh how lofty are their eyes! and their eyelids are lifted up." "The enlargement of the heart" is the cause of the proud look, for it signifies the evil affections and concupiscence of the will, wholly filled up with self, and controlling the actions and expression of the body. Septuagint, "A high-minded man (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b7;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) is stout-hearted in his pride." <span class="cmt_word">And the ploughing of the wicked is sin.</span> The Authorized Version takes the reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">nir</span>), which means "tillage' (<a href="/proverbs/13-23.htm">Proverbs 13:23</a>), or, as Delitzsch supposes, "land ploughed for the first time" (<span class="accented">novale</span>). The proverb, taken thus, will mean, "high look, proud heart, even all the field which the godless cultivate, all that they do, is sin." "Pride," says the Talmud, "is worse than sin." But another pointing gives a different and very appropriate (comp. <a href="/proverbs/13-9.htm">Proverbs 13:9</a>; <a href="/proverbs/24-20.htm">Proverbs 24:20</a>) meaning. <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">ner</span>) signifies "a lamp." Thus the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Lucerna impiorum peccatum</span>, "The lamp of the wicked is sin;" and the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> "Lamp" is, as often, a metaphor for prosperity and happiness (comp. <a href="/2_samuel/22-29.htm">2 Samuel 22:29</a>; <a href="/1_kings/11-36.htm">1 Kings 11:36</a>); and it is here said that the sinner's outward prosperity and joyousness, springing from no good source, being founded in self, and not resting on virtue and godliness, are in themselves sinful and displeasing to God. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/20.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>28 Love and truth guard the king;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And he supports his throne by love.<p>We have not in the German [nor in the Eng.] language a couple of words that completely cover &#1495;&#1505;&#1491; &#1493;&#1488;&#1502;&#1514;; when they are used of God, we translate them by grace and truth [Gnade u. Wahrheit], <a href="/psalms/40-12.htm">Psalm 40:12</a> (&#1497;&#1510;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;); when of men, by love and truth [Liebe u. Treue], <a href="/proverbs/16-6.htm">Proverbs 16:6</a>; and when of the two-sided divine forces, by kindness and truth, <a href="/proverbs/3-3.htm">Proverbs 3:3</a>. Love and truth are the two good spirits that guard the king. If it is elsewhere said that the king's throne is supported "with judgment and with justice," <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a> [7]; here, on the other side, we see that the exercise of government must have love as its centre; he has not only to act on the line of right, &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514; &#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503;; but, as the later proverb says, in such a way, that within this circle his conduct is determined by the central motive of love. In this sense we give the king not only the title of Grossmchtigster [most high and mighty], but also that of "Allergndigster" most gracious, for the king can and ought to exercise grace before other men; the virtue of condescension establishes his throne more than the might of greatness. </body></html>
