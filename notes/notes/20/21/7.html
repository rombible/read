Or cut them, so Ben Melech: dissect or "saw" (s) them; cut them to the heart; that is, when the sins they have been guilty of, in robbing God of his due, or doing injury to men in their properties, cheating them or stealing from them, are set home on their consciences, they are in the utmost agonies and distress; it is as if a saw was drawn to and fro over them, and will be their case for ever without true repentance: this is the worm that never dies, and the fire that is never quenched; this is everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and is very just and righteous; <p>because they refuse to do judgment; to do that which is just between man and man, to let everyone enjoy his own property: as it is true of private robbers, so of men in public offices, whose business it is to defend men in the quiet possession of property; which, if they refuse to do, as it is a refusal to do judgment, it is in effect a robbery of them; and will be charged on their consciences at one time or another. <p>(s) "dissecabit eos", Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator; "serrabit eos", Aben Ezra &amp; Kimchi in Mercer.

The reason of this fate is given in the concluding hemistich: <span class="cmt_word">Because they refuse to do judgment.</span> This is a judicial retribution on them for wilfully declining (ver. 25) to do what is right. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/21.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The group, like the preceding one, now closes with a proverb of the king.<p>A king's heart in Jahve's hand is like brooks of water;<p>He turneth it whithersoever He will.<p>Brook and canal (the Quinta: &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;) are both called &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1490;, or &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1490;, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/20-17.htm">Job 20:17</a>, Arab. falaj (from &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1490;, to divide, according to which Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion, &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;; Venet. &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;; Jerome, divisiones); Jkt has the explanation of the word: "falaj is the name given to flowing water, particularly the brook from a spring, and every canal which is led from a spring out over flat ground." Such brooks of water are the heart of a king, i.e., it is compared to such, in Jahve's hand. The second line contains the point of comparison: He inclines it, gives to it the direction (&#1492;&#1496;&#1468;&#1492;, causat. of &#1504;&#1496;&#1492;, <a href="/numbers/21-15.htm">Numbers 21:15</a>) toward whatever He will (&#1495;&#1508;&#1509; denotes willing, as a bending and inclining, viz., of the will; vid., at <a href="/proverbs/18-2.htm">Proverbs 18:2</a>). Rightly Hitzig finds it not accidental that just the expression "brooks of water" is chosen as the figure for tractableness and subjection to government. In <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/32-2.htm">Isaiah 32:2</a>, the princes of Judah are compared to "rivers of water in a dry place" with reference to the exhaustion of the land during the oppression of the Assyrian invasion; the proverb has specially in view evidences of kindness proceeding from the heart, as at <a href="/proverbs/16-15.htm">Proverbs 16:15</a> the favour of the king is compared to clouds of latter rain emptying themselves in beneficent showers, and at <a href="/proverbs/19-12.htm">Proverbs 19:12</a> to the dew refreshing the plants. But the speciality of the comparison here is, that the heart of the king, however highly exalted above his subjects, and so removed from their knowledge he may be, has yet One above it by whom it is moved by hidden influences, e.g., the prayer of the oppressed; for man is indeed free, yet he acts under the influence of divinely-directed circumstances and divine operations; and though he reject the guidance of God, yet from his conduct nothing results which the Omniscient, who is surprised by nothing, does not make subservient to His will in the world-plan of redemption. Rightly the Midrash: God gives to the world good or bad kings, according as He seeks to bless it or to visit it with punishment; all decisions that go forth from the king's mouth come &#1500;&#1499;&#1514;&#1495;&#1500;&#1492;, i.e., in their first commencement and their last reason they come from the Holy One. </body></html>
