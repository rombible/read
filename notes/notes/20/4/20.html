It is not said, Keep at a due distance, but at a great distance; never think you can get far enough from it. The way of the righteous is light; Christ is their Way, and he is the Light. The saints will not be perfect till they reach heaven, but there they shall shine as the sun in his strength. The way of sin is as darkness. The way of the wicked is dark, therefore dangerous; they fall into sin, but know not how to avoid it. They fall into trouble, but never seek to know wherefore God contends with them, nor what will be in the end of it. This is the way we are bid to shun. Attentive hearing the word of God, is a good sign of a work of grace begun in the heart, and a good means of carrying it on. There is in the word of God a proper remedy for all diseases of the soul. Keep thy heart with all diligence. We must set a strict guard upon our souls; keep our hearts from doing hurt, and getting hurt. A good reason is given; because out of it are the issues of life. Above all, we should seek from the Lord Jesus that living water, the sanctifying Spirit, issuing forth unto everlasting life. Thus we shall be enabled to put away a froward mouth and perverse lips; our eyes will be turned from beholding vanity, looking straight forward, and walking by the rule of God's word, treading in the steps of our Lord and Master. Lord, forgive the past, and enable us to follow thee more closely for the time to come.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The teacher speaks again in his own person. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20-22.

In <a href="/proverbs/4-14.htm">Proverbs 4:14</a> the godless (vid., on the root-idea of &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; under <a href="/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a>) and the habitually wicked, i.e., the vicious, stand in parallelism; &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1488; and &#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1512; are related as entering and going on, ingressus and progressus. The verb &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; signifies, like &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, to be straight, even, fortunate, whence &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;  equals  Arab. yusa&#770;r, happiness, and to step straight out, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/9-6.htm">Proverbs 9:6</a>, of which meanings &#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1512; is partly the intensive, as here, partly the causative, <a href="/proverbs/23-19.htm">Proverbs 23:19</a> (elsewhere causative of the meaning, to be happy, <a href="/genesis/30-13.htm">Genesis 30:13</a>). The meaning progredi is not mediated by a supplementary &#1510;&#1506;&#1491;&#1497;&#1493;; the derivative &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; (&#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;), a step, shows that it is derived immediately from the root-idea of a movement in a straight line. Still less justifiable is the rendering by Schultens, ne vestigia imprimas in via malorum; for the Arab. a&#770;ththr is denom. of ithr, &#1488;&#1514;&#1512;, the primitive verb roots of which, athr, &#1488;&#1514;&#1512;  equals  &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, are lost.</body></html>
