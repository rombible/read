Solomon's parents loved him, therefore taught him. Wise and godly men, in every age of the world, and rank in society, agree that true wisdom consists in obedience, and is united to happiness. Get wisdom, take pains for it. Get the rule over thy corruptions; take more pains to get this than the wealth of this world. An interest in Christ's salvation is necessary. This wisdom is the one thing needful. A soul without true wisdom and grace is a dead soul. How poor, contemptible, and wretched are those, who, with all their wealth and power, die without getting understanding, without Christ, without hope, and without God! Let us give heed to the sayings of Him who has the words of eternal life. Thus our path will be plain before us: by taking, and keeping fast hold of instruction, we shall avoid being straitened or stumbling.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Or, "The beginning of wisdom is - get wisdom."

The father recalls the instruction which he has given in times past. So Delitzsch. But Gejerus gives them the combined force of the past and future, "I have taught and I will more fully teach," and so with the other verb. The Vulgate renders, <span class="accented">monstrabo</span>, "I will show," and <span class="accented">ducam</span>, "<span class="accented">I</span> will lead." <span class="cmt_word">In the way of wisdom</span> (<span class="accented">b'derek khok'mah</span>) may mean "in the way that leads <span class="accented">to</span>, or by which you come to Wisdom; I have taught you the manner in which Wisdom may be attained;" or "the way in which Wisdom walks" (Zockler). The ways of Wisdom are described in <a href="/proverbs/3-17.htm">Proverbs 3:17</a> as "<span class="accented">ways</span> of pleasantness." The next clause seems to indicate that the latter explanation is to be preferred. The (<span class="accented">b</span>) indicates the subject in which instruction has been given. <span class="cmt_word">In right paths</span> (<span class="accented">b'ma'g'le yosher</span>); literally, <span class="accented">in the paths of rectitude</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of straightness, paths of which the characteristic is uprightness. (On "paths," as signifying a carriageway, see <a href="/proverbs/2-9.htm">Proverbs 2:9</a>.) <span class="accented">Instruction</span> and <span class="accented">direction</span> have formed the two elements in the father's teaching. These present us with a model of education. "To teach <span class="accented">duty</span> without <span class="accented">truth</span> is to teach <span class="accented">practice</span> without <span class="accented">motive</span>; to teach <span class="accented">truth</span> without <span class="accented">duty</span> is to teach motive without the practice to which it should lead" (Wardlaw). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The exhortation of the father now specializes itself:<p>5 Get wisdom, get understanding;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Forget not and turn not from the words of my mouth.<p>6 Forsake her not, so shall she preserve thee;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Love her, so shall she keep thee.<p>Wisdom and understanding are (5a) thought of as objects of merchandise (cf. <a href="/proverbs/23-23.htm">Proverbs 23:23</a>; <a href="/proverbs/3-14.htm">Proverbs 3:14</a>), like the one pearl of great price, <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/13-46.htm">Matthew 13:46</a>, and the words of fatherly instruction (5b), accordingly, as offering this precious possession, or helping to the acquisition of it. One cannot indeed say correctly &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1514;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1495; &#1502;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1470;&#1508;&#1497;, but &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1514;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1495; &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512; &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1470;&#1508;&#1497; (<a href="/psalms/102-5.htm">Psalm 102:5</a>); and in this sense &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1495; goes before, or also the accus. object, which in &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1514;&#1513;&#1499;&#1495; the author has in his mind, may, since he continues with &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1514;&#1468;&#1496;, now not any longer find expression as such. That the &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1470;&#1508;&#1497; are the means of acquiring wisdom is shown in <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/4-6.htm">Proverbs 4:6</a>, where this continues to be the primary idea. The verse, consisting of only four words, ought to be divided by Mugrash;<p>(Note: According to correct readings in codd. and older editions, &#1493;&#1514;&#1513;&#1502;&#1512;&#1498;&#1468; has also indeed Rebia Mugrash, and &#1488;&#1492;&#1489;&#1492;, Mercha (with Zinnorith); vid., Torath Emeth, p. 47, 6; Accentuationssystem, xviii. 1, 2; and regarding the Zinnorith, see Liber Psalmorum Hebraicus by S. Baer, p. xii.)<p>the Vav (&#1493;) in both halves of the verse introduces the apodosis imperativi (cf. e.g., <a href="/proverbs/3-9.htm">Proverbs 3:9</a>., and the apodosis prohibitivi, <a href="/proverbs/3-21.htm">Proverbs 3:21</a>.). The actual representation of wisdom, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/4-5.htm">Proverbs 4:5</a>, becomes in <a href="/proverbs/4-6.htm">Proverbs 4:6</a> personal. </body></html>
