Solomon's parents loved him, therefore taught him. Wise and godly men, in every age of the world, and rank in society, agree that true wisdom consists in obedience, and is united to happiness. Get wisdom, take pains for it. Get the rule over thy corruptions; take more pains to get this than the wealth of this world. An interest in Christ's salvation is necessary. This wisdom is the one thing needful. A soul without true wisdom and grace is a dead soul. How poor, contemptible, and wretched are those, who, with all their wealth and power, die without getting understanding, without Christ, without hope, and without God! Let us give heed to the sayings of Him who has the words of eternal life. Thus our path will be plain before us: by taking, and keeping fast hold of instruction, we shall avoid being straitened or stumbling.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The counsel which has come to him, in substance, from his father.

His object in doing so is to show that his own teaching was in harmony with it, and therefore worthy of attention. His precepts, admonitions, and warnings are not his only, but those of his father. Other examples of David's instructions to Solomon are found in <a href="/1_kings/2-2.htm">1 Kings 2:2</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/22-12.htm">1 Chronicles 22:12, 13</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/28-9.htm">1 Chronicles 28:9</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And he taught;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his father, for <span class="accented">vayyoreni</span> is masculine.

Vulgate, <span class="accented">et vives</span>). The meaning is, "And thou shalt enjoy a long and happy life." Temporal life alone seems to be indicated, as in ver. 10 (cf. <a href="/proverbs/3-2.htm">Proverbs 3:2</a>). The Syriac addition, "And my law as the apple of thine eye," is probably borrowed from <a href="/proverbs/7-2.htm">Proverbs 7:2</a>, where we meet with the mine admonition. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The prosperity of the godless, far from being worthy of envy, has as its reverse side the curse:<p>The curse of Jahve is in the house of the godless,<p>And the dwelling of the just He blesseth.<p>&#1502;&#1488;&#1512;&#1492; (a curse), like &#1502;&#1505;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; (a highway, from &#1505;&#1500;&#1500;), is formed from &#1488;&#1512;&#1512; (cf. Arab. harr, detestari, abhorrere, a word-imitation of an interjection used in disagreeable experiences). The curse is not merely a deprivation of external goods which render life happy, and the blessing is not merely the fulness of external possessions; the central-point of the curse lies in continuous disquiet of conscience, and that of the blessing in the happy consciousness that God is with us, in soul-rest and peace which is certain of the grace and goodness of God. The poetic &#1504;&#1493;&#1492; (from &#1504;&#1493;&#1492;  equals  Arab. nwy, tetendit aliquo) signifies the place of settlement, and may be a word borrowed from a nomad life, since it denotes specially the pasture-ground; cf. <a href="/proverbs/24-15.htm">Proverbs 24:15</a> (Fleischer). While the curse of God rests in the house of the wicked (vid., Khler on <a href="/zechariah/5-4.htm">Zechariah 5:4</a>), He blesses, on the contrary, the dwelling-place of the righteous. The lxx and Jerome read &#1497;&#1489;&#1512;&#1498;, but &#1497;&#1489;&#1512;&#1498; is more agreeable, since God continues to be the subject. </body></html>
