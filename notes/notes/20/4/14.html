It is not said, Keep at a due distance, but at a great distance; never think you can get far enough from it. The way of the righteous is light; Christ is their Way, and he is the Light. The saints will not be perfect till they reach heaven, but there they shall shine as the sun in his strength. The way of sin is as darkness. The way of the wicked is dark, therefore dangerous; they fall into sin, but know not how to avoid it. They fall into trouble, but never seek to know wherefore God contends with them, nor what will be in the end of it. This is the way we are bid to shun. Attentive hearing the word of God, is a good sign of a work of grace begun in the heart, and a good means of carrying it on. There is in the word of God a proper remedy for all diseases of the soul. Keep thy heart with all diligence. We must set a strict guard upon our souls; keep our hearts from doing hurt, and getting hurt. A good reason is given; because out of it are the issues of life. Above all, we should seek from the Lord Jesus that living water, the sanctifying Spirit, issuing forth unto everlasting life. Thus we shall be enabled to put away a froward mouth and perverse lips; our eyes will be turned from beholding vanity, looking straight forward, and walking by the rule of God's word, treading in the steps of our Lord and Master. Lord, forgive the past, and enable us to follow thee more closely for the time to come.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>She is thy life - Another parallel between personified Wisdom in this book and the Incarnate Wisdom in <a href="/john/1-4.htm">John 1:4</a>.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14.

Which leads to eternal death; join not with them in their wicked ways and practices; have no fellowship, keep no company, with them; do not set one foot in the path they tread, lest thou shouldest be tempted to proceed to more ungodliness; you do not know where and when there will be a stop, when once you begin, therefore enter not. The Vulgate Latin version is, "do not delight in the paths of the ungodly": but this supposes not only entrance, but progress and continuance in them, whereas the first is dehorted from in these words: <p>and go not in the way of evil men; if tempted and prevailed upon to take a step and make a trial, do not proceed; withdraw at once, do not go on. Some render it, seeing the word used has sometimes the signification of blessedness in it, "do not esteem the way of evil men blessed" (y); nor reckon thyself or them happy that walk in such ways; they are far from it: hence the Targum, Septuagint, and Syriac versions are, "do not envy the ways of wicked men"; their seeming pleasure will end in bitterness: the Arabic version is, "do not imitate" them; do not follow their example, and do as they do. <p>(y)   "in via malorum ne te beatum existimes", Tiguriue version; "ne beatam praedices viam malorum", Michaelis. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil men.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/4.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">14</span>.

The connection with the preceding section is obvious. There are two ways diametrically opposite - the way of wisdom and the way of evil; the one the way of life, the other fraught with death, because a way of darkness and violence. As the father has dealt with the former, so now he deals with the latter. With these warnings we may also comp. <a href="/proverbs/1-10.htm">Proverbs 1:10-15</a> and Proverbs 2:10-15, where much the same warning is given, and the way of the wicked is described in almost the same terms. The warning of the father takes a threefold form: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> enter not; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> go not; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> avoid. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In effect he says this is the only course to be adopted in order to keep a firm hold of Wisdom which he has counselled in the preceding verse (13). <span class="cmt_word">Enter not;</span> <span class="accented">al-tavo</span>, from <span class="accented">bo</span>. "to come in," "to enter," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> do not even enter. The Vulgate renders, "Delight not in," evidently from reading <span class="accented">tove</span>, which occurs in <a href="/proverbs/1-10.htm">Proverbs 1:10</a>. But our reading is to be preferred, as <span class="accented">avah</span>, "to acquiesce in," from which <span class="accented">tov'e</span>, is not used with <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;</span>, here denoting place, but with <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b4;</span>. Go not (<span class="accented">al-t'ashsher</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> do not walk in. The two verbs "to enter" (<span class="accented">bo</span>) and "to go" (<span class="accented">ishsher</span>) stand in the relation of <span class="accented">entering</span> and <span class="accented">going on</span> - <span class="accented">ingressus</span> and <span class="accented">progressus.</span> So Gejerus and Delitzsch. The piel <span class="accented">ishsher</span>, here used, is properly "to go straight on," like the kal <span class="accented">ashar</span>, of which it is an intensive (cf. <a href="/proverbs/9-6.htm">Proverbs 9:6</a>). It is the bold, presumptuous walk, the stepping straight out of the evil, which is here indicated, and against this the father warns his son. The sense is, "If you have entered the way of the wicked, do not continue or persevere in it." The other meanings of the verb <span class="accented">ashar</span>, viz. "to guide straight" (<a href="/proverbs/23-19.htm">Proverbs 23:19</a>), "to esteem happy and prosperous" (<a href="/proverbs/31-28.htm">Proverbs 31:28</a>), are not in place here, as they destroy the parallelism of thought, and on the same ground the LXX. and Syriac renderings, "envy not" and <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>, are to be rejected. <span class="cmt_word">The wicked</span> (<span class="accented">ishaim</span>)<span class="accented">, i.e.</span> the godless (cf, <a href="/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a>), is parallel with "evil men" (<span class="accented">raim</span>)<span class="accented">, i.e.</span> the habitually wicked. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The meaning of the &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;. &#1505;&#1500;&#1505;&#1500; is determined by &#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1501; in the parallel clause; &#1505;&#1500;&#1500; signifies to raise, exalt, as a way or dam by heaping up; the Pilpel, here tropical: to value or estimate highly.
