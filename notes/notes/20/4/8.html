Solomon's parents loved him, therefore taught him. Wise and godly men, in every age of the world, and rank in society, agree that true wisdom consists in obedience, and is united to happiness. Get wisdom, take pains for it. Get the rule over thy corruptions; take more pains to get this than the wealth of this world. An interest in Christ's salvation is necessary. This wisdom is the one thing needful. A soul without true wisdom and grace is a dead soul. How poor, contemptible, and wretched are those, who, with all their wealth and power, die without getting understanding, without Christ, without hope, and without God! Let us give heed to the sayings of Him who has the words of eternal life.

Christ is to be exalted in his person, by asserting his proper deity; by ascribing all divine perfections to him; by allowing him to be the author of all divine works; by giving him divine worship and homage; by owning his divine and eternal sonship, and distinct personality: he is to be exalted in all his offices of Prophet, Priest, and King, and as the only Redeemer and Saviour; by trusting in him, embracing his Gospel, and submitting to his ordinances, and such that exalt him, he will "promote" them here and hereafter; of which more in the next clause. According to the Talmudists (u), the word for "exalt" signifies a diligent search, by turning things about to find out what is sought; and so the Septuagint interpret the word in the sense of "searching", <a href="/jeremiah/50-26.htm">Jeremiah 50:26</a>; <p>she shall bring thee to honour, when thou dost embrace her: by faith: for this is an act of faith, and a very considerable one, and is expressive of great nearness to Christ, of much intimacy and familiarity with him, of strong love and affection to him, of a good degree of boldness used with him, and of joy and exaltation in him; for such an action is used by persons near akin, and are very familiar with, and have a very great affection for one another, and use much freedom with each other, and rejoice at meeting together. Now such who embrace Christ, in the arms of their faith, as their alone Saviour, such he promotes and "brings to honour"; not to honour among men, for to embrace Christ and exalt him is the way to disgrace, though the disgrace is an honour, and will be before long rolled off; but to honour hereafter. Such will be set at his right hand, and be owned by him before his Father and his angels; and they will be placed on the same throne with him, and will reign with him for ever and ever; see <a href="/1_samuel/2-30.htm">1 Samuel 2:30</a>. <p>(u) T.

It is equivalent to the kal form. The pilpel form only occurs here, but the kal participle is met with in <a href="/proverbs/15-19.htm">Proverbs 15:19</a>, where it has the meaning of "to raise up as a causeway" (see marginal reading <span class="accented">in loc.</span>). Gesenius renders, "exalt her," <span class="accented">sc.</span> with praises. The meaning of the verb, as Delitzsch says, is to be determined, by the corresponding "she shall promote thee" (<span class="accented">th'rom'mek</span>), and this verb <span class="accented">romem</span> is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to raise or make high; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> to exalt by bestowing honours upon one of low estate, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> raising them in general estimation; it is so used in <a href="/1_samuel/2-7.htm">1 Samuel 2:7</a> by Hannah, in her song of thankfulness, "He (Jehovah) bringeth low and lifteth up (<span class="accented">m'romem</span>);" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> to extol by praises, as in <a href="/psalms/30-2.htm">Psalm 30:2</a>. The radical meaning of <span class="accented">salal</span> seems to be "to heap up," as a road is prepared by embankments, and by the filling up of inequalities (cf. <a href="/isaiah/62-10.htm">Isaiah 62:10</a>). In this sense the passage before us is explained by Levi ben Gersom, "Prepare the way of Wisdom, and walk assiduously in it." But the context, wherein the idea of buying is evidently used. favours Bottcher's interpretation, "Hold it or her high in price, bid high for her as a purchaser who makes offer upon offer, to secure what he wants." So Pi, <span class="accented">in pretio habe.</span> The LXX. rendering, "Circumvallate her, enclose her with a wall or hedge," which is reproduced in the Arabic, <span class="accented">circumsepi eam</span>, "hedge her around," seems out of place with the context. The Talmudists understand the verb as signifying "to examine closely," "to scrutinize, meditate, or reflect" upon Wisdom constantly, just as the Roman, poet says, "Nocturna versate manu, versate diurna" - "We exalt Wisdom when we follow her precepts," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> when we esteem her - the idea which is presented to us in the Targum and Syriac cited above. The sentiment of the verse agrees with what Jehovah says in the message of the man of God to Eli, in <a href="/1_samuel/2-30.htm">1 Samuel 2:30</a>, "Them that honour me I will honour." <span class="cmt_word">She shall bring thee to honour, when thou dost embrace her.</span> The LXX. reverses the order of ideas, "Honour her in order that she may embrace thee." <span class="accented">Embrace her</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in a loving and affectionate manner, as a husband does his wife, or a son his mother. (For the verb <span class="accented">khavak</span>, see <a href="/proverbs/5-20.htm">Proverbs 5:20</a>: <a href="/songs/2-6.htm">Song of Solomon 2:6</a>; <a href="/songs/8-3.htm">Song of Solomon 8:3</a>.) There are only three  other instances where this verb occurs in the pilel form, <span class="accented">khibbek.</span> Esteem and honour, the confidence of others, elevation to offices of trust and consequence, are some of the rewards with which Wisdom repays those who esteem and love her.

This he does by his own example, for he relates from the history of his own youth, to the circle of disciples by whom he sees himself surrounded, what good doctrine his parents had taught him regarding the way of life:<p>1 Hear, ye sons, the instruction of a father,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; And attend that ye may gain understanding;<p>2 For I give to you good doctrine,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Forsake not my direction!<p>3 For I was a son to my father,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; A tender and only (son) in the sight of my mother.<p>4 And he instructed me, and said to me:<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let thine heart hold fast my words:<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Observe my commandments and live!"<p>That &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; in the address comes here into the place of &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;, hitherto used, externally denotes that &#1489;&#1504;&#1497; in the progress of these discourses finds another application: the poet himself is so addressed by his father. Intentionally he does not say &#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501; (cf. <a href="/proverbs/1-8.htm">Proverbs 1:8</a>): he does not mean the father of each individual among those addressed, but himself, who is a father in his relation to them as his disciples; and as he manifests towards them fatherly love, so also he can lay claim to paternal authority over them. &#1500;&#1491;&#1506;&#1514; is rightly vocalized, not &#1500;&#1491;&#1506;&#1514;. The words do not give the object of attention, but the design, the aim. The combination of ideas in &#1491;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492; (cf. <a href="/proverbs/1-2.htm">Proverbs 1:2</a>), which appears to us singular, loses its strangeness when we remember that &#1491;&#1506;&#1514; means, according to its etymon, deposition or reception into the conscience and life.
