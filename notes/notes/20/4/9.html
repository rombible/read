Solomon's parents loved him, therefore taught him. Wise and godly men, in every age of the world, and rank in society, agree that true wisdom consists in obedience, and is united to happiness. Get wisdom, take pains for it. Get the rule over thy corruptions; take more pains to get this than the wealth of this world. An interest in Christ's salvation is necessary. This wisdom is the one thing needful. A soul without true wisdom and grace is a dead soul. How poor, contemptible, and wretched are those, who, with all their wealth and power, die without getting understanding, without Christ, without hope, and without God! Let us give heed to the sayings of Him who has the words of eternal life. Thus our path will be plain before us: by taking, and keeping fast hold of instruction, we shall avoid being straitened or stumbling.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Or, "The beginning of wisdom is - get wisdom."

This, and the following clause, explain what that honour is Christ promotes and brings his followers to here and hereafter: he gives them grace and more grace; "an increase of grace", so the Vulgate Latin version renders it; and some think James refers to this passage, <a href="/proverbs/4-6.htm">Proverbs 4:6</a>. The grace that Christ gives is very ornamental to his people: justifying grace greatly beautifies and adorns them; it not only covers the nakedness of their souls, and all their spots and imperfections, and through it all their sins are caused to pass from them; but they are made exceeding beautiful, perfectly comely through this comeliness, a perfection of beauty by it; and which is often signified by that which is very ornamental, rich, and costly, as fine linen, clothing of wrought gold, raiment of needlework, a Wedding garment, stuck with jewels and precious stones: sanctifying grace, which also is Christ's gift, is very ornamental; it is called "the beauty of holiness"; it is that by which a man is made like to God, and conformed to the image of Christ; it is the curious workmanship of the Spirit of God; or what makes a man beautiful, and makes him meet for heaven and happiness: every grace is ornamental; faith, hope, love, humility, &amp;c. these are like rows of jewels, and chains of gold, about the neck. And when this ornament is said to be given "to the head", it is not to be understood of the natural head of a man, but of his whole person, it gives a comeliness to; and may denote the visibility of it, as it appears in the life and conversation; <p>a crown of glory shall she deliver to thee; by which is meant eternal glory and happiness, called a "crown", an ensign of royal dignity, which, belongs to such as are made kings and priests unto God; and is given to conquerors, even who are more than conquerors through Christ, and as a reward of diligence and faithfulness, <a href="/revelation/2-10.htm">Revelation 2:10</a>. It is sometimes called a crown of life, a crown of righteousness, an incorruptible and never-fading one, and, as here, "a crown of glory"; the saints in heaven will have a glory put upon them, both in soul and body; they will appear with Christ in glory, and be crowned with glory and honour, as he is; they will be clothed and surrounded with it: and so some render it, <p>"she will compass thee about with a crown of glory as with a shield'' (w); <p>see <a href="/psalms/5-12.htm">Psalm 5:12</a>. This Christ is said to "deliver"; it is in his hands, laid up in him, and is safe with him; he has power to dispose of it, and it may be expected from him; see <a href="/2_timothy/4-8.htm">2 Timothy 4:8</a>. <p>(w) , Sept.

That this is the meaning is clear from the corresponding "she shall give" (<span class="accented">titten</span>, but cf. <span class="accented">nathan</span>, "to give"). It is commonly found with an accusative and dative, but here takes two accusatives.

"A crown of glory," in the New Testament, is always associated with the everlasting honours of heaven, as in <a href="/hebrews/2-9.htm">Hebrews 2:9</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/4-8.htm">2 Timothy 4:8</a>; <a href="/1_peter/4-4.htm">1 Peter 4:4</a>; <a href="/revelation/2-20.htm">Revelation 2:20</a>.

This he does by his own example, for he relates from the history of his own youth, to the circle of disciples by whom he sees himself surrounded, what good doctrine his parents had taught him regarding the way of life:<p>1 Hear, ye sons, the instruction of a father,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; And attend that ye may gain understanding;<p>2 For I give to you good doctrine,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Forsake not my direction!<p>3 For I was a son to my father,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; A tender and only (son) in the sight of my mother.<p>4 And he instructed me, and said to me:<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let thine heart hold fast my words:<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Observe my commandments and live!"<p>That &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; in the address comes here into the place of &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;, hitherto used, externally denotes that &#1489;&#1504;&#1497; in the progress of these discourses finds another application: the poet himself is so addressed by his father. Intentionally he does not say &#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501; (cf. <a href="/proverbs/1-8.htm">Proverbs 1:8</a>): he does not mean the father of each individual among those addressed, but himself, who is a father in his relation to them as his disciples; and as he manifests towards them fatherly love, so also he can lay claim to paternal authority over them. &#1500;&#1491;&#1506;&#1514; is rightly vocalized, not &#1500;&#1491;&#1506;&#1514;. The words do not give the object of attention, but the design, the aim. The combination of ideas in &#1491;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492; (cf. <a href="/proverbs/1-2.htm">Proverbs 1:2</a>), which appears to us singular, loses its strangeness when we remember that &#1491;&#1506;&#1514; means, according to its etymon, deposition or reception into the conscience and life. Regarding &#1500;&#1511;&#1495;, apprehension, reception, lesson  equals  doctrine, vid., <a href="/proverbs/1-5.htm">Proverbs 1:5</a>. &#1504;&#1514;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; is the perf., which denotes as fixed and finished what is just now being done, Gesenius, 126, 4. &#1506;&#1494;&#1489; is here synonym of &#1504;&#1496;&#1513;&#1473;, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/1-8.htm">Proverbs 1:8</a>, and the contrary of &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;, <a href="/proverbs/28-4.htm">Proverbs 28:4</a>.
