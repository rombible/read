It is not said, Keep at a due distance, but at a great distance; never think you can get far enough from it. The way of the righteous is light; Christ is their Way, and he is the Light. The saints will not be perfect till they reach heaven, but there they shall shine as the sun in his strength. The way of sin is as darkness. The way of the wicked is dark, therefore dangerous; they fall into sin, but know not how to avoid it. They fall into trouble, but never seek to know wherefore God contends with them, nor what will be in the end of it. This is the way we are bid to shun. Attentive hearing the word of God, is a good sign of a work of grace begun in the heart, and a good means of carrying it on. There is in the word of God a proper remedy for all diseases of the soul. Keep thy heart with all diligence. We must set a strict guard upon our souls; keep our hearts from doing hurt, and getting hurt. A good reason is given; because out of it are the issues of life. Above all, we should seek from the Lord Jesus that living water, the sanctifying Spirit, issuing forth unto everlasting life. Thus we shall be enabled to put away a froward mouth and perverse lips; our eyes will be turned from beholding vanity, looking straight forward, and walking by the rule of God's word, treading in the steps of our Lord and Master. Lord, forgive the past, and enable us to follow thee more closely for the time to come.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>She is thy life - Another parallel between personified Wisdom in this book and the Incarnate Wisdom in <a href="/john/1-4.htm">John 1:4</a>.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14.

As dangerous and pernicious, as abominable and detestable; or, "flee from it", as the Vulgate Latin version: Jarchi and Gersom interpret it, "make it void"; cause it to cease, destroy it, do all you can to hinder the wicked from accomplishing their designs; <p>pass not by it; do not come near it; keep at a distance from it, that you may not be drawn into it; abstain from all appearance of evil, and everything that may lead to it; <p>turn from it, and pass away; the Targum adds, "from them", from wicked men.

(On the verb, see <a href="/proverbs/1-25.htm">Proverbs 1:25</a>, where it is rendered, "set at naught.") The same verb also occurs in <a href="/proverbs/8-33.htm">Proverbs 8:33</a>; <a href="/proverbs/13-18.htm">Proverbs 13:18</a>; <a href="/proverbs/15-32.htm">Proverbs 15:32</a>. <span class="accented">It</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the way.

Turn from it (<span class="accented">s'teh mealayv</span>). The original is a pregnant expression equivalent to "turn aside from it, so that you do not come to stand upon it." The word <span class="accented">mealayv</span>, equivalent to the Latin <span class="accented">desuper ea</span>, has much the same force as the French <span class="accented">de dessus</span> and the Italian <span class="accented">di sopra</span> (Delitzsch).

The injunction, so absolutely stated, to have nothing to do with sin, is required, if not indeed prompted, by the knowledge of the fact that youth, confident in its own power of resistance, frequently indulges in the fatal mistake of imagining that it can dally with sin with impunity. The only course compatible with safety is to entirely avoid it. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The meaning of the &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;. &#1505;&#1500;&#1505;&#1500; is determined by &#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1501; in the parallel clause; &#1505;&#1500;&#1500; signifies to raise, exalt, as a way or dam by heaping up; the Pilpel, here tropical: to value or estimate highly.
