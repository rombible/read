Or, "eyes elated" (d); scorning to look down upon others; or looking upon them with disdain; or reckoning them as unworthy to be looked upon, having an high opinion of their own worth and merit. Pride is the first of the hateful things mentioned; it being the first sin committed, as is probable, the sin of the angels, and of the first man; and is a predominant evil in human nature, and is directly opposite to God and to his nature, and against which he sets himself; for "he resisteth the proud", <a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>; the pride of the heart shows itself in the eyes, or by the looks of a man; Gersom says, the phrase denotes impudence and haughtiness; <p>a lying tongue; that is the second of the hateful things; a tongue speaking falsehood, knowingly and willingly, with an intention to deceive others; to hurt the character of a neighbour, or to flatter a friend, is a most detestable evil; it ought to be so to men, it must be so to God, who is a God of truth: nor is there anything in which a man more resembles the devil, who is the father of lies; <p>and hands that shed innocent blood; human blood; and that of persons who have not been guilty of any capital sin, for which they ought to die by the laws of God or men, and yet shed or poured out as common water; such hands must be defiled, and such men must be hateful to God, they destroying his image, and being like to the devil, who was a murderer from the beginning. These "three" sins are plainly to be seen in the son of Belial, antichrist, who exalts himself above all that is called God, the kings and princes of the earth; he and his followers speak lies in hypocrisy; and is the whore that is drunk with the blood of the saints, <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-4.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:4</a>. <p>(d)  "oculi clati", Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator, Michaelis. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/6.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">17</span>. <span class="ital">A proud look</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">haughty eyes,</span> A.V. margin, R.V. text.

It is not merely the look which is meant, but the temper of mind which the look expresses (Wardlaw). The lofty look is the indication of the swelling pride which fills the heart, the <span class="accented">mentis elatae tumor</span>, the supreme disdain, <span class="accented">grande supercilium</span>, for everything and everybody. Pride is put first, because it is at the bottom of all disobedience and rebellion against God's laws. It is the very opposite of humility, which the apostle, in <a href="/ephesians/4-2.htm">Ephesians 4:2</a>, mentions as the basis, as it were, of all the virtues. All pride is intended, and the face of the Lord is against this pride. He "resisteth the proud;" he "knoweth them afar off;" he "hath respect unto the lowly;" he "will bring down high looks" (<a href="/psalms/18-27.htm">Psalm 18:27</a>); he judgeth those that are high (<a href="/job/21-22.htm">Job 21:22</a>). It is against this spirit that Job prays Jehovah "to behold every one that is proud, and abase him," and "to look upon every one that is proud, and bring him low" (<a href="/job/40-11.htm">Job 40:11, 12</a>). The next thing in the enumeration is a lying tongue. Lying is hateful to God, because he is the God of truth. In a concise form the expression, "a lying tongue," represents what has been already said in vers. 12 and 13 of "the wicked man" who "walks with a froward mouth," and whose conduct is made up of deceit. Lying is the wilful perversion of truth, not only by speech, but by any means whatever whereby a false impression is conveyed to the mind. The liar "sticks not at any lies, flatteries, or calumnies" (Patrick). Lying is elsewhere denounced as the subject which excites the Divine displeasure (see <a href="/psalms/5-6.htm">Psalm 5:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/120-3.htm">Psalm 120:3, 4</a>; <a href="/hosea/4-1.htm">Hosea 4:1-3</a>; <a href="/revelation/21-8.htm">Revelation 21:8, 27</a>); and in the early Christian Church, in the case of Ananias and Sapphira, it was punished with death. On the subject of lying, see St. Augustine, 'Enchiridion,' c. 18, wherein he says, "Mihi autem videtur peccatum quidem esse omne mendacium." Every lie is a sin. The third thing is <span class="cmt_word">hands that shed innocent blood,</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a murderous and cruel disposition, which, rather than have its plans frustrated, will imbue the hands with innocent blood, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the blood of those who have done it no injury. The Divine command is, "Thou shall do no murder," and those who break it will find, even if they escape man, that the Lord is "the avenger of blood," and that he "maketh inquisition" for it (cf. ch. 1. and 2, and <a href="/isaiah/59-7.htm">Isaiah 59:7</a>, which bear a close resemblance to this passage). That the shedding of innocent blood cues for vengeance, and pulls down God's heavy judgments on the murderer, appears in the case of Cain and Abel (Muffet). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The point of comparison, 11a, is the unforeseen, as in quick march or assault (Bttcher), and 11b the hostile and irretrievable surprise; for a man in armour, as Hitzig remarks, brings no good in his armour: he assails the opponent, and he who is without defence yields to him without the possibility of withstanding him.

After <a href="/proverbs/6-11.htm">Proverbs 6:11</a> they interpose two other lines: "but if thou art assiduous, thy harvest will come to thee as a fountain, but want will go away &#x3c9;&#788;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c2;."

The four lines, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/6-10.htm">Proverbs 6:10</a>, <a href="/proverbs/6-11.htm">Proverbs 6:11</a> are repeated in the appendix of Words of the Wise, <a href="/proverbs/24-33.htm">Proverbs 24:33</a>.; and if this appendix originated in the time of Hezekiah, they may have been taken therefrom by the poet, the editor of the older Book of Proverbs. Instead of &#1499;&#1502;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1498;, &#1502;&#1514;&#1492;&#1500;&#1498; is there used (so comes forward thy poverty, i.e., again and again, but certainly moving forward); and instead of &#1502;&#1495;&#1505;&#1512;&#1498;, &#1502;&#1495;&#1505;&#1512;&#1497;&#1498; is written, as also here, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/6-6.htm">Proverbs 6:6</a>, for &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1514;&#1498; is found the variant &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1514;&#1497;&#1498; with Jod as mater lectionis of the pausal Segol. </body></html>
