Let not faithful reproofs ever make us uneasy. When we consider how much this sin abounds, how heinous adultery is in its own nature, of what evil consequence it is, and how certainly it destroys the spiritual life in the soul, we shall not wonder that the cautions against it are so often repeated. Let us notice the subjects of this chapter. Let us remember Him who willingly became our Surety, when we were strangers and enemies. And shall Christians, who have such prospects, motives, and examples, be slothful and careless? Shall we neglect what is pleasing to God, and what he will graciously reward?

The "tying about" the neck may suggest the use of amulets, an Oriental custom, to ward off evil, but it is more likely that it refers to the wearing of ornaments. <span class="cmt_word">Them</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the <span class="accented">commandment</span> and <span class="accented">law</span> of father and mother respectively, expressed in the Hebrew by the suffix -<span class="accented">em</span>, in the verb <span class="accented">kosh'rem</span>, equivalent to <span class="accented">liga ea</span>, and again in <span class="accented">ondem</span>, equivalent to <span class="accented">vinci ea.</span> (For the personal use of this figure, see <a href="/songs/8-6.htm">Song of Solomon 8:6</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">Tie them;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">ondem.</span> The verb <span class="accented">anad</span>, "to tie," only occurs twice as a verb - here and in <a href="/job/31-36.htm">Job 31:36</a>. Lee prefers "to bind;" Delitzsch, however, states that it is equivalent to the Latin <span class="accented">circumplicare</span>, "to wind about." The meaning of this and similar passages (cf. <a href="/proverbs/7-3.htm">Proverbs 7:3</a>; <a href="/exodus/13-9.htm">Exodus 13:9</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/6-8.htm">Deuteronomy 6:8</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/11-13.htm">Deuteronomy 11:13</a>) is that the commandment, precept, law, or whatever is intended, should be always present to the mind. The <span class="cmt_word">heart</span> suggests that they are to be linked to the affections, and the <span class="cmt_word">neck</span> that they will be an ornament decking the moral character. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>With the 14th verse the description terminates.

"Shall be broken to pieces" (as a brittle potter's vessel, <a href="/psalms/2-9.htm">Psalm 2:9</a>; <a href="/isaiah/30-14.htm">Isaiah 30:14</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/29-11.htm">Jeremiah 29:11</a>) is a frequent figure for the destruction (&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1512;) of an army (cf. Arab. a&#770;nksar a&#770;ljysh), of a city or a state, a man. &#1493;&#1488;&#1497;&#1503; continues the &#1497;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1489;&#1512; as <a href="/proverbs/29-1.htm">Proverbs 29:1</a> : there shall be as it were no means of recovery for his shattered members (Fl.). Without the Vav this &#1488;&#1497;&#1503; &#1502;&#1512;&#1508;&#1468;&#1488; would be a clause conceived of accusatively, and thus adverbially: without any healing. </body></html>
