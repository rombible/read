The ants are more diligent than slothful men. We may learn wisdom from the meanest insects, and be shamed by them. Habits of indolence and indulgence grow upon people. Thus life runs to waste; and poverty, though at first at a distance, gradually draws near, like a traveller; and when it arrives, is like an armed man, too strong to be resisted. All this may be applied to the concerns of our souls. How many love their sleep of sin, and their dreams of worldly happiness! Shall we not seek to awaken such?

Or this may be directed, not to the surety, but the debtor; who, through his slothfulness, has contracted debts, and uses no industry to be in a capacity to pay them. Or, it may be, this has no connection with the former; but the wise man proceeds to a new subject, and to dissuade from idleness, which brings ruin on families, and leads to all sin; and, for the instruction of idle and slothful men, proposes the example of the ant, and sends them to it to learn industry of it (h); <p>consider her ways; what diligence and industry it uses in providing its food; which, though a small, weak, feeble creature, yet will travel over flints and stones, climb trees, enter into towers, barns, cellars, places high and low, in search of food; never hinder, but help one another in carrying their burdens; prepare little cells to put their provisions in, and are so built as to secure them from rain; and if at any time their corn is wet, they bring out and dry it, and bite off the ends of it, that it may not grow.

Warning against sloth.</span> The ethical connection of this discourse with the preceding has already been pointed out. Sloth militates against prosperity; it is the prolific parent of want, and, even more surely than suretyship, leads to misfortune and ruin, The certainty with which ruin steals upon the sluggard may be the reason why the teacher closes the discourse in the way he does. In the case of suretyship such an issue is uncertain; there is the possibility of escape, the surety may prevail upon his friend to release him from his obligation, and so he may escape ruin; but with sloth no such contingency is possible, its invariable end is disaster. So far as the grammatical structure of the two discourses is concerned, they appear to be quite independent of each other, the only points of coincidence observable being the repetition of one or two words, which is purely accidental (cf. "go" in vers. 3 and 6, and "sleep" and "slumber" in vers. 4 and 10). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise.</span> The ant (Hebrew, <span class="accented">n'malah</span>) is here brought forward as supplying an example of wisdom to the sluggard. The habits of this insect, its industry and providence, have in all ages made it the symbol of these two qualities, and not only the sacred, but also profane writers have praised its foresight, and held it up for imitation. The ant is only mentioned twice in the Old Testament, and on both occasions in our book (see present passage and <a href="/proverbs/30-25.htm">Proverbs 30:25</a>). The derivation of <span class="accented">n'malah</span> is either from the root <span class="accented">nam</span>, with reference first to the silence with which it moves, and secondly to its active yet unperceived motion (Delitzsch), or from <span class="accented">namal</span>, <span class="accented">i.q.</span> <span class="accented">malal</span>, "to cut off," from its cutting off or consuming seeds (<span class="accented">ab incidendis seminibus</span>) (Buxtorf, Gesenius). The Aramaic name, <span class="accented">shum'sh'manah</span>, however, points to its activity and rapid running hither and thither (Fleischer). <span class="accented">Sluggard</span>; Hebrew, <span class="accented">atsel</span>, a verbal adjective tbund only in the Proverbs. The primary idea of the root <span class="accented">atsal</span> is that of languor and laxity. The cognate abstract nouns <span class="accented">ats'lah</span> and <span class="accented">ats'luth</span>, equivalent to "slothfulness," occur in <a href="/proverbs/19-15.htm">Proverbs 19:15</a>; <a href="/proverbs/31-27.htm">Proverbs 31:27</a>. <span class="accented">Consider her ways</span>; attentively regard them, and from them derive a lesson of wisdom. Her ways are the manner in which the ant displays her industry and foresight. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>That the intercourse of the sexes out of the married relationship is the commencement of the ruin of a fool is now proved.<p>21 For the ways of every one are before the eyes of Jahve,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And all his paths He marketh out.<p>22 His own sins lay hold of him, the evil-doer,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And in the bands of his sins is he held fast.<p>23 He dies for the want of correction,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And in the fulness of his folly he staggers to ruin.<p>It is unnecessary to interpret &#1504;&#1499;&#1495; as an adverbial accusative: straight before Jahve's eyes; it may be the nominative of the predicate; the ways of man (for &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; is here an individual, whether man or woman) are an object (properly, fixing) of the eyes of Jahve. With this the thought would suitably connect itself: et onmes orbitas ejus ad amussim examinat; but &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1505;, as the denom. of &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1505;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/58-3.htm">Psalm 58:3</a>, is not connected with all the places where the verb is united with the obj. of the way, and <a href="/psalms/78-50.htm">Psalm 78:50</a> shows that it has there the meaning to break though, to open a way (from &#1508;&#1500;, to split, cf. Talmudic &#1502;&#1508;&#1500;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;, opened, accessible, from &#1508;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;, Syriac pelaa, perfodere, fodiendo viam, aditum sibi aperire). The opening of the way is here not, as at <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/26-7.htm">Isaiah 26:7</a>, conceived of as the setting aside of the hindrances in the way of him who walks, but generally as making walking in the way possible: man can take no step in any direction without God; and that not only does not exempt him from moral responsibility, but the consciousness of this is rather for the first time rightly quickened by the consciousness of being encompassed on every side by the knowledge and the power of God. The dissuasion of <a href="/proverbs/5-20.htm">Proverbs 5:20</a> is thus in <a href="/proverbs/5-21.htm">Proverbs 5:21</a> grounded in the fact, that man at every stage and step of his journey is observed and encompassed by God: it is impossible for him to escape from the knowledge of God or from dependence on Him. Thus opening all the paths of man, He has also appointed to the way of sin the punishment with which it corrects itself: "his sins lay hold of him, the evil-doer." The suffix  &#1497;&#1493; does not refer to &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; of <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/5-21.htm">Proverbs 5:21</a>, where every one without exception and without distinction is meant, but it relates to the obj. following, the evil-doer, namely, as the explanatory permutative annexed to the "him" according to the scheme, <a href="/exodus/2-6.htm">Exodus 2:6</a>; the permutative is distinguished from the apposition by this, that the latter is a forethought explanation which heightens the understanding of the subject, while the former is an explanation afterwards brought in which guards against a misunderstanding. The same construction, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/14-13.htm">Proverbs 14:13</a>, belonging to the syntaxis ornata in the old Hebrew, has become common in the Aramaic and in the modern Hebrew. Instead of &#1497;&#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; (<a href="/proverbs/5-22.htm">Proverbs 5:22</a>), the poet uses poetically &#1497;&#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1491;&#1504;&#1493;; the interposed &#1504; may belong to the emphatic ground-form &#1497;&#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;, but is epenthetic if one compares forms such as &#1511;&#1489;&#1504;&#1493; (R. &#1511;&#1489;), <a href="/numbers/23-13.htm">Numbers 23:13</a> (cf. p. 73). The &#1495;&#1502;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514;&#1493; governed by &#1495;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497;, laquei (&#1495;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497;, tormina), is either gen. exeg.: bands which consist in his sin, or gen. subj.: bands which his sin unites, or better, gen. possess.: bands which his sin brings with it. By these bands he will be held fast, and so will die: he (&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; referring to the person described) will die in insubordination (Symm. &#x3b4;&#x3b9; &#787; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;), or better, since &#1488;&#1497;&#1503; and &#1512;&#1489; are placed in contrast: in want of correction. With the &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1490;&#1468;&#1492; (<a href="/proverbs/5-23.htm">Proverbs 5:23</a>), repeated purposely from <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/5-20.htm">Proverbs 5:20</a>, there is connected the idea of the overthrow which is certain to overtake the infatuated man. In <a href="/proverbs/5-20.htm">Proverbs 5:20</a> the sense of moral error began already to connect itself with this verb. &#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514; is the right name of unrestrained lust of the flesh. &#1488;&#1493;&#1500;&#1514; is connected with &#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;, the belly; &#1488;&#1493;&#1500;, Arab. a&#770;l, to draw together, to condense, to thicken (Isaiah, p. 424). Dummheit (stupidity) and the Old-Norse dumba, darkness, are in their roots related to each other. Also in the Semitic the words for blackness and darkness are derived from roots meaning condensation. &#1488;&#1493;&#1497;&#1500; is the mind made thick, darkened, and become like crude matter. </body></html>
