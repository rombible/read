With the recognized Hebrew form of climax (see <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/30-15.htm">Proverbs 30:15</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/30-18.htm">Proverbs 30:18</a>, <a href="/proverbs/30-24.htm">Proverbs 30:24</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/1-1.htm">Amos 1:1-15</a>; 2; <a href="/job/5-19.htm">Job 5:19</a>), the teacher here enumerates six qualities as detestable, and the seventh as worse than all (seven represents completeness), but all the seven in this instance belong to one man, the man of Belial <a href="/proverbs/6-12.htm">Proverbs 6:12</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16-19. six &#8230; seven&#8212;a mode of speaking to arrest attention (Pr 30:15, 18; Job 5:19).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/proverbs/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Hate, </span> to wit, above many other sins, which have a worse name in the world. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/proverbs/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>These six things doth the Lord hate,.... That is, the six following, which are all to be found in a man of Belial, a wicked man before described. There are other things besides these that God hates, and indeed more so; as sins against the first table, which more immediately strike at his being, horror, and glory; these being such as are against the second table, but are mentioned, as more especially appearing in the character of the above person; and must be hateful to God, as contrary to his nature, will, and law; <p>yea, seven are an abomination unto him; or, "the abomination of his soul" (c); what his soul abhors, or he abhors from his very heart: meaning not seven others, but one more along with the six, which make seven; a like way of speaking, see in <a href="/proverbs/30-15.htm">Proverbs 30:15</a>. Nor is the word "abomination" to be restrained to the "seventh", or "hatred" to the "sixth"; but they are all to be supposed to be hateful and abominable to the Lord; though some think the cardinal number is put for the ordinal, "seven" for the "seventh"; as if the seventh, which is sowing discord among brethren, was of all the most abominable, <a href="/proverbs/6-19.htm">Proverbs 6:19</a>; it being what was last mentioned in the character of the wicked man, <a href="/proverbs/6-14.htm">Proverbs 6:14</a>; and which seems to have given occasion to, and for the sake of which this enumeration is made. <p>(c)  "abominatio ejus animae", Montanus, Vatablus, Mercerus, Cocceius, Michaelis, Schultens. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">These six things doth the LORD hate: yea, seven are an abomination unto him:</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/6.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">16</span>. <span class="ital">six … seven</span>] To specify more precisely the traits that go to form the character of the man of Belial, and to lift them into the sphere of God’s judgement, that we may make a true estimate of them, they are these six, yea seven, for they are complete, and the shades of darkness, like the rays of light, are sevenfold, and Jehovah hates them, and they are the abomination of His soul.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - The whole structure and arrangement of the thoughts which occur in vers. 16-19 clearly show that this is not an independent section, but one closely allied to that which has just preceded. The object is to show that those evil qualities of deceit and malice which are disastrous to man are equally odious in the sight of Jehovah, and consequently within the scope of the Divine displeasure. <span class="cmt_word">These six things doth the Lord hate: yea, seven are an abomination unto him.</span> The use of the numerical proverb, though common to the gnomic literature of Persia and Arabia, as Umbreit shows, is by our author confined to this single instance. Other examples occur in our book in the words of Agur the son of Jakeh (see <a href="/proverbs/30-7.htm">Proverbs 30:7-9, 24-28</a>), and the midda, the name given by later Jewish writers to this form of proverb, is observable in the ape-cryphal Book of Ecclesiasticus (see <a href="/proverbs/23-16.htm">Proverbs 23:16</a>; <a href="/proverbs/20-7.htm">Proverbs 20:7</a> and Proverbs 26:5-28). When, as in the present instance, two numbers are given, the larger number corresponds with the things enumerated. So in <a href="/job/5-19.htm">Job 5:19</a>. In <a href="/amos/1.htm">Amos 1</a> and 2, however, there is an exception to this rule, where the numbers appear to be used indefinitely. As to the origin of the numerical proverb, the most probable explanation is that given by Hitzig and adopted by Zockler, namely, that it is due to the exigencies of parallelism. The author first adopts one number optionally, and then a second is employed as a parallel to it. Here, however, the number determined on in the writer's mind is the larger number seven, and the smaller number six is used as a rhetorical parallel. An examination of the following verses will show that the seven exactly measures the things which are described as odious to the Lord. The Authorized Version, so far as the numbers are concerned, exactly represents the original, which, by the use of the cardinal number "seven" (<span class="accented">sheva</span>), and not the ordinal "seventh," which would be <span class="accented">sh'vii</span>, shows that the things enumerated are equally an abomination in God's sight. The view  therefore, that the seventh vice is odious to God in an especial degree above the others, is untenable, though it has found defenders in Lowenstein, Bertheau, and von Gerlach, and is supported by the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Sex sunt quae odit Dominus, et septimum detestatur anima ejus.</span> All the seven things are execrable, all are equally objects of the Divine abhorrence. Besides, we cannot imagine that the vice of sowing discord among brethren, of ver. 19, is more odious to God than the crime of shedding innocent blood of ver. 17. <span class="accented">Unto him</span> (Hebrew, <span class="accented">naph'sho</span>); literally, <span class="accented">of his soul.</span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>After the poet has admonished the sluggard to take the ant as an example, he seeks also to rouse him out of his sleepiness and indolence:<p>9 How long, O sluggard, wilt thou lie?<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; When wilt thou rise up from thy sleep?<p>10 "A little sleep, a little slumber,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; A little folding of the hands to rest!"<p>11 So comes like a strong robber thy poverty,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; And thy want as an armed man.<p><a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/6-9.htm">Proverbs 6:9-10</a><p>The awakening cry, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/6-9.htm">Proverbs 6:9</a>, is not of the kind that Paul could have it in his mind, <a href="/ephesians/5-14.htm">Ephesians 5:14</a>. &#1506;&#1510;&#1500; has, as the vocative, Pasek after it, and is, on account of the Pasek, in correct editions accentuated not with Munach, but Mercha.
