Let not faithful reproofs ever make us uneasy. When we consider how much this sin abounds, how heinous adultery is in its own nature, of what evil consequence it is, and how certainly it destroys the spiritual life in the soul, we shall not wonder that the cautions against it are so often repeated. Let us notice the subjects of this chapter. Let us remember Him who willingly became our Surety, when we were strangers and enemies. And shall Christians, who have such prospects, motives, and examples, be slothful and careless? Shall we neglect what is pleasing to God, and what he will graciously reward? May we closely watch every sense by which poison can enter our minds or affections.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The two forms of evil bring, each of them, their own penalty. By the one a man is brought to such poverty as to beg for "a piece of bread" (compare <a href="/1_samuel/2-36.htm">1 Samuel 2:36</a>): by the other and more deadly sin he incurs a peril which may affect his life. The second clause is very abrupt and emphatic in the original; "but as for a man's wife; she hunts for the precious life." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>34, 35. nor any terms of reconciliation be admitted.<p>regard&#8212;or, "accept" any ransom.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/proverbs/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> He will accept of no other recompence for the injury beneath thy life. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/proverbs/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>He will not regard any ransom,.... So that his case is much worse than, a thief's; if he is taken, he makes restitution according to law, and he is freed, and no more is said and done to him; and, at most, it is but parting with all the goods in his house; but in this case it will not do. In the Hebrew text it is, "he will not accept the face of any ransom" (z); that is, as the Targum paraphrases it, <p>"he will not accept the face of anyone that gives a gift:'' <p>he will have no respect unto him for the sake of the gift; whatever gift is offered, be it what it will, for the ransom of his life from death, it will be disregarded; <p>neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts; increase them, and keep continually giving; nothing but the life of the adulterer will satisfy him, which he will either take away himself, or obtain it in a way of legal prosecution. How foolish therefore is the man that will expose his name and credit, his health and substance, his life in this world, and his soul in another, to utter ruin, for the sake of gratifying a sordid lust! This may be interpreted of God, who is a jealous God in matters of worship, and will not suffer idolatry to go unpunished, which is spiritual adultery. <p>(z)   "non accipiet facies", Montanus; "non acceptabit faciem ullius redemptionis", Mercerus, Gejerus; "ullius lytri", Cocceius, Michaelis, Schultens. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts.</span> No recompense or atonement, nor any gifts however great, will buy him off. These are supposed to be offered by the adulterer to the enraged husband, who, however, will never rest till he effects the utter ruin of his injurer. The literal rendering of the first hemistich is, "He will not accept the face of any ransom." The phrase <span class="accented">nasa phanim</span>, is equivalent to the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, and signifies "to give a favourable reception to the outward expression of any one." The figure is taken from lifting up the face of a suppliant, the radical meaning of the verb <span class="accented">nasa</span> being "to take up," "to lift up." The <span class="accented">ransom</span>; Hebrew, <span class="accented">kopher</span> (the word usually applied to designate the price of redemption, mulct, or line demanded for expiation of a crime; see <a href="/exodus/21-30.htm">Exodus 21:30</a>; <a href="/exodus/30-12.htm">Exodus 30:12</a>; <a href="/numbers/35-31.htm">Numbers 35:31, 32</a>); here the bribe offered by the adulterer to be let off will be altogether rejected, however alluring, the word <span class="accented">p'ney</span>, "face," carrying with it the  idea of something recommendatory. For the expression, <span class="accented">nasa phanim</span>, cf. <a href="/genesis/19-21.htm">Genesis 19:21</a>; <a href="/genesis/22-21.htm">Genesis 22:21</a>; <a href="/job/13-10.htm">Job 13:10</a>; <a href="/job/13-8.htm">Job 13:8</a>; and <a href="/malachi/1-8.htm">Malachi 1:8</a>.

(On the verb <span class="accented">avah</span>, "to consent to," or "to be willing," see <a href="/proverbs/1-10.htm">Proverbs 1:10</a>.) Many gifts, each increasing in value, may be offered, but he will not be willing to forego his right of revenge. <span class="accented">Though thou givest many gifts.</span> It is noticeable that the address, which has been adapted to the third person, here becomes personal, and so takes up the form originally employed in vers. 20-25. A hypothetical case has been imagined in vers. 26-35, but still with the thought underlying it that it applies to the person addressed. "Though <span class="accented">thou</span> givest many gifts," or more literally, "though thou multipliest the gift," brings the matter homo to the young man. <span class="accented">Gifts</span>; Hebrew, <span class="accented">shokad</span>, "the gift," is the word usually employed to designate the bribe offered to corrupt a judge (see <a href="/exodus/23-8.htm">Exodus 23:8</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/10-17.htm">Deuteronomy 10:17</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/16-19.htm">Deuteronomy 16:19</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/27-25.htm">Deuteronomy 27:25</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/8-3.htm">1 Samuel 8:3</a>). Here it refers to the money offered to free from punishment. The Vulgate gives the idea that these gifts or bribes are offered by a third party on behalf of the adulterer: <span class="accented">Nec acquiescet cujusquam precibus, nec suscipiet pro redemptione dona plurima.</span> On these two last verses Lange remarks, "Just as little as the adulterer, taken in his adultery, is left unpunished by the injured husband, so little, yea, even less, wilt the spiritual adulterer remain unpunished of the Lord (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-17.htm">1 Corinthians 3:17</a>)." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The instruction contained in these examples here follows: &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c1; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3ba;&#x3b1; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x399;&#787;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; (Pythagoras in Maximi Eclog. c. 39). &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1488; &#1488;&#1500; is here, as the second in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/51-1.htm">Psalm 51:1</a>, a euphemism, and &#1504;&#1490;&#1506; &#1489;&#1468;, to come in contact with, means, as &#1504;&#1490;&#1506; &#1488;&#1500;, to touch, <a href="/genesis/20-6.htm">Genesis 20:6</a>.
