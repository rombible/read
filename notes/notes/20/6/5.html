We are stewards of our worldly substance, and have to answer to the Lord for our disposal of it; to waste it in rash schemes, or such plans as may entangle us in difficulties and temptations, is wrong. A man ought never to be surety for more than he is able and willing to pay, and can afford to pay, without wronging his family; he ought to look upon every sum he is engaged for, as his own debt. If we must take all this care to get our debts to men forgiven, much more to obtain forgiveness with God. Humble thyself to him, make sure of Christ as thy Friend, to plead for thee; pray earnestly that thy sins may be pardoned, and that thou mayest be kept from going down to the pit.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Better, "Do this now, O my son, and free thyself when thou hast come into thy friend's house; go, how thyself down (perhaps "stamp with thy foot," or "hasten"), press hotly upon thy friend.

The variation in all the ancient versions, with the exception of the Vulgate and Venetian, which read "from the snare," suggests that the original text was <span class="accented">mippath</span> instead of <span class="accented">miyyad.</span> The Hebrew <span class="accented">yad</span>, "hand," may, however, be used by metonymy for a toil or gin; but this is improbable, as no example of this kind can be found. With regard to the addition, "of the hunter," though this does not occur in the original, the parallelism would seem to clearly require it, and Bottcher maintains, but upon insufficient evidence, and against the reading of all manuscripts, which omit it, that the word <span class="accented">tsayyad</span>, equivalent to "of the hunter," formed part of the original text, but has fallen out. The plain reading, "from the hand," may, however, be used absolutely, as in <a href="/1_kings/20-42.htm">1 Kings 20:42</a>, "Because thou hast let go out of thy hand (miyyad)," in which case the hand will not be that of the hunter, but that of the person for whom the one is surety. <span class="cmt_word">Roe</span>. There is a paronomasia in <span class="accented">ts'vi</span>, equivalent to "roe," and <span class="accented">tsiphor</span>, equivalent to "bird," of the original, which is lost in the Authorized Version. The <span class="accented">ts'vi</span> is the "roe" or "gazelle," so named from the beauty of its form (see also <a href="/songs/2-7.htm">Song of Solomon 2:7-9, 17</a>; <a href="/songs/3-5.htm">Song of Solomon 3:5</a>; <a href="/songs/8-14.htm">Song of Solomon 8:14</a>; <a href="/1_kings/5-3.htm">1 Kings 5:3</a>; <a href="/isaiah/13-14.htm">Isaiah 13:14</a>). <span class="accented">Tsippor</span> is a generic word, and represents any small bird. It is derived from the twittering or chirping noise which the bird makes, the root being <span class="accented">tsaphar</span>, "to chirp, or twitter." As to its identification with the sparrow, <span class="accented">Passer montanus</span>, or the blue thrush, <span class="accented">Petrocossyphus cyanens</span> (see 'Bible Animals,' Rev. J.G.

With this the thought would suitably connect itself: et onmes orbitas ejus ad amussim examinat; but &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1505;, as the denom. of &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1505;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/58-3.htm">Psalm 58:3</a>, is not connected with all the places where the verb is united with the obj. of the way, and <a href="/psalms/78-50.htm">Psalm 78:50</a> shows that it has there the meaning to break though, to open a way (from &#1508;&#1500;, to split, cf. Talmudic &#1502;&#1508;&#1500;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;, opened, accessible, from &#1508;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;, Syriac pelaa, perfodere, fodiendo viam, aditum sibi aperire). The opening of the way is here not, as at <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/26-7.htm">Isaiah 26:7</a>, conceived of as the setting aside of the hindrances in the way of him who walks, but generally as making walking in the way possible: man can take no step in any direction without God; and that not only does not exempt him from moral responsibility, but the consciousness of this is rather for the first time rightly quickened by the consciousness of being encompassed on every side by the knowledge and the power of God. The dissuasion of <a href="/proverbs/5-20.htm">Proverbs 5:20</a> is thus in <a href="/proverbs/5-21.htm">Proverbs 5:21</a> grounded in the fact, that man at every stage and step of his journey is observed and encompassed by God: it is impossible for him to escape from the knowledge of God or from dependence on Him. Thus opening all the paths of man, He has also appointed to the way of sin the punishment with which it corrects itself: "his sins lay hold of him, the evil-doer." The suffix  &#1497;&#1493; does not refer to &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; of <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/5-21.htm">Proverbs 5:21</a>, where every one without exception and without distinction is meant, but it relates to the obj. following, the evil-doer, namely, as the explanatory permutative annexed to the "him" according to the scheme, <a href="/exodus/2-6.htm">Exodus 2:6</a>; the permutative is distinguished from the apposition by this, that the latter is a forethought explanation which heightens the understanding of the subject, while the former is an explanation afterwards brought in which guards against a misunderstanding. The same construction, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/14-13.htm">Proverbs 14:13</a>, belonging to the syntaxis ornata in the old Hebrew, has become common in the Aramaic and in the modern Hebrew. Instead of &#1497;&#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; (<a href="/proverbs/5-22.htm">Proverbs 5:22</a>), the poet uses poetically &#1497;&#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1491;&#1504;&#1493;; the interposed &#1504; may belong to the emphatic ground-form &#1497;&#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;, but is epenthetic if one compares forms such as &#1511;&#1489;&#1504;&#1493; (R. &#1511;&#1489;), <a href="/numbers/23-13.htm">Numbers 23:13</a> (cf. p. 73). The &#1495;&#1502;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514;&#1493; governed by &#1495;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497;, laquei (&#1495;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497;, tormina), is either gen. exeg.: bands which consist in his sin, or gen. subj.: bands which his sin unites, or better, gen. possess.: bands which his sin brings with it. By these bands he will be held fast, and so will die: he (&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; referring to the person described) will die in insubordination (Symm. &#x3b4;&#x3b9; &#787; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;), or better, since &#1488;&#1497;&#1503; and &#1512;&#1489; are placed in contrast: in want of correction. With the &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1490;&#1468;&#1492; (<a href="/proverbs/5-23.htm">Proverbs 5:23</a>), repeated purposely from <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/5-20.htm">Proverbs 5:20</a>, there is connected the idea of the overthrow which is certain to overtake the infatuated man. In <a href="/proverbs/5-20.htm">Proverbs 5:20</a> the sense of moral error began already to connect itself with this verb. &#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514; is the right name of unrestrained lust of the flesh. &#1488;&#1493;&#1500;&#1514; is connected with &#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;, the belly; &#1488;&#1493;&#1500;, Arab. a&#770;l, to draw together, to condense, to thicken (Isaiah, p. 424). Dummheit (stupidity) and the Old-Norse dumba, darkness, are in their roots related to each other. Also in the Semitic the words for blackness and darkness are derived from roots meaning condensation. &#1488;&#1493;&#1497;&#1500; is the mind made thick, darkened, and become like crude matter. </body></html>
