The ants are more diligent than slothful men. We may learn wisdom from the meanest insects, and be shamed by them. Habits of indolence and indulgence grow upon people. Thus life runs to waste; and poverty, though at first at a distance, gradually draws near, like a traveller; and when it arrives, is like an armed man, too strong to be resisted. All this may be applied to the concerns of our souls. How many love their sleep of sin, and their dreams of worldly happiness! Shall we not seek to awaken such? Shall we not give diligence to secure our own salvation?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The words express the wonder with which the Hebrew observer looked on the phenomena of insect life.

Against the winter, of which it is mindful, when it never comes out of its place, having in the summer time got a sufficiency laid up in cells for its use: she toils in the heat of summer to get in her provision for the winter, being sensible that nothing is to be gotten then; she works at it night and day while the season lasts; so diligent is it in laying up its stores at the proper opportunity (l); <p>and gathereth her food in the harvest; the time when corn is ripe, and is shed on the earth; this it gathereth, and lays up in its repositories against a time of need. The seeds it gathers and lays up; it bites off the chit or bud end of them, that they may not grow, as Pliny (m) and others observe, but be a winter store; hence its name in Hebrew is "nemalah", from "namal", "to cut off"; it being done by biting. Yea, according to Aelianus (n), it seems to have some sense of futurity with respect to famine, which being near, it will work exceeding hard to lay up food, fruits, and seed; and, according to Virgil (o) and others, it seems to presage old age, and therefore provides against it. An instruction this to work, while persons are in health, and have youth on their side; that they may have not only a sufficiency for present use, but to lay up against a time of sickness and old age. The Septuagint and Arabic versions add, <p>"or go to the bee, and learn what a worker she is, and what an admirable work she performs; whose labours kings and private persons use for health: she is desirable to all, and famous; and though weak in strength, honouring wisdom is advanced.'' <p>But this is not in the Hebrew text; but perhaps being written in the margin of some copy of the Septuagint as a parallel instance, was by some unskilful copier put into the text of the Greek version, from whence the Arabic version has taken it; it crept in very early, for Clemens of Alexandria makes mention of it (p). <p>(l) "Ac veluti ingentem formicae farris acervum", &amp;c.

The LXX. addition to this verse is interesting, both as illustrating their tendency to gloss, and also because it exhibits the bee in a favourable light, as an example of industry and wisdom, whereas, unless we regard it as latent in the use of the word as a proper name (<span class="ital">Deborah</span>, <a href="/judges/4-4.htm" title="And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged Israel at that time.">Jdg 4:4</a>), that character of the insect is never referred to by the O.T. writers, who were familiar with it only in its wild state, and had no opportunity of watching its habits, but only noticed its vindictiveness in attacking men (<a href="/psalms/118-12.htm" title="They compassed me about like bees: they are quenched as the fire of thorns: for in the name of the LORD I will destroy them.">Psalm 118:12</a>; <a href="/isaiah/7-18.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall hiss for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria.">Isaiah 7:18</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Their addition is:—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Or, go to the bee, and learn what a work woman she is,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And how comely she makes her work,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Whose labours kings and common people gather to them,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And she is desired and had in honour of all men for health;<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And though she be weak in strength of body,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Yet through her honouring wisdom is she advanced.”<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Provideth her meat in the summer, and gathereth her food in the harvest.</span> It is this characteristic, combined with what has just been said, which gives point to the lesson the sluggard is to learn. The teacher, as it were, argues: If the ant, so insignificant a creature in the order of the animal kingdom, is so provident, how much more should you be - you, a man endued with superior intelligence, and with so many more resources at hand, and with greater advantages! If the ant, with none to urge, direct, or control her work, is so industrious, surely she provides an example at which you, the sluggard, should blush, since there is every external incentive to rouse you to action - your duty to the community, the urgent advice of your friends, and your dignity as a man. If she provides for the future, much more should you do so, and threw off your sloth. Objection has been taken to what is here stated of the provident habits of the ant in storing food, on the ground that it is carnivorous and passes the winter in a state of torpidity. That the ant does lay up stores for future use has, however, been the opinion of all ages. Thus Hesiod ('Days,' 14) speaks of the ant as harvesting the grain, calling it <span class="greek">&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, "the provident." Virgil says ('Georg.,' 1, 186; cf. 'AEneid,' 4:4027) - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Veluti ingentem formicae farris acervum<br />Quum populant hiemis memores, tectoque repenunt."</span> So the ants, when they plunder a tall heap of corn, mindful of the winter, store it in their cave. The language of Horace ('Sat.,' 1:50, 32) might be a comment on our passage - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Parvula (nam exemplo est) magni formica laboris sicut<br />Ore trahit quodcunque potest, atque addit acervo,<br />Quem struit, haud ignara ac non incauta futuri,<br />Quae, simul universum contristat Aquarius annum<br />Non usquam prorepit, et illis utitur ante Quaesitis sapiens."</span><br /><br /><span class="accented">"For thus the little ant (to human lore<br />No mean example) forms her frugal store,<br />Gathered, with mighty toils, on every side,<br />Nor ignorant, nor careless to provide<br />For future want; yet when the stars appear<br />That darkly sadden the declining year,<br />No more she comes abroad, but wisely lives<br />On the fair store industrious summer gives."</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">Francis' Translation.</span>) The same provident character is noted in AEsop's fable, 'The Ant and the Grasshopper;' see also Aristotle ('Hist. Nat.,' 9:6). All objections on this subject appear to be based on insufficient data, and have been conclusively answered by recent observation. Apart from the remark of Buffon, that "the ants of tropical climates <span class="accented">lay up provisions</span>, and as they probably live the whole year, they submit themselves to regulations entirely unknown among the ants of Europe." The late Professor Darwin states of the agricultural ant of Texas, which in many features resembles the ant of Palestine, that it not only <span class="accented">stores its food</span>, but prepares the soil for the crops, keeps the ground free from weeds, and finally reaps the harvest (<span class="accented">Journal of Linnaean Society</span>, vol. 1, No. 21, p. 29). Canon Tristram also observes, "The language of the wise man is not only in accordance with the universal belief of his own time, but with the accurately ascertained facts of natural history. Contrary to its habits in colder climates, the ant is not there dormant through the winter; and among the tamerisks of the Dead Sea it may be seen, in January, actively engaged in collecting the aphides and saccharine exudations, in long flies passing and repassing up and down the trunk. Two of the most common species of the Holy Land (<span class="accented">Alta barbara</span>, the black ant, and <span class="accented">Alta structor</span>, the brown ant) are strictly seed feeders, and in summer lay up large stores of grain for winter use. These species are spread along the whole of the Mediterranean coasts, but are unknown in more northern climates. Hence writers who were ignorant of ants beyond those of their own countries have been presumptuous  enough to deny the accuracy of Solomon's statement" ('Nat. Hist. of the Bible,' p. 320). The Mishna, section 'Zeraim,' also contains a curious piece of legislation which bears testimony to the storing properties of the ant. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The author warns against suretyship; or rather, he advises that if one has made himself surety, he should as quickly as possible withdraw from the snare.<p>1 My son, if thou hast become surety for thy neighbour,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Hast given thy hand for another:<p>2 Thou art entangled in the words of thy mouth,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Ensnared in the words of thy mouth.<p>3 Do this then, my son, and free thyself - <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; For thou hast come under the power of thy neighbour - <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Go, instantly entreat and importune thy neighbour.<p>4 Give no sleep to thine eyes,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; And no slumber to thine eyelids;<p>5 Tear thyself free like a gazelle from his hand,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; And as a bird from the hand of the fowler.<p>The chief question here is, whether &#1500; after &#1506;&#1512;&#1489; introduces him for whom or with whom one becomes surety. Elsewhere &#1506;&#1512;&#1489; (R. &#1512;&#1489;, whence also &#1488;&#1512;&#1489;, nectere, to twist close and compact) with the accusative of the person means to become surety for any one, to represent him as a surety, <a href="/proverbs/11-15.htm">Proverbs 11:15</a>; <a href="/proverbs/20-16.htm">Proverbs 20:16</a> (<a href="/proverbs/27-13.htm">Proverbs 27:13</a>), <a href="/genesis/43-9.htm">Genesis 43:9</a>; <a href="/genesis/44-33.htm">Genesis 44:33</a> (as with the accusative of the matter, to pledge anything, to deposit it as a pledge, <a href="/jeremiah/30-21.htm">Jeremiah 30:21</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/5-3.htm">Nehemiah 5:3</a>,  equals  &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1501;, Arab. wad&#803;'a, <a href="/job/17-3.htm">Job 17:3</a>); and to become surety with any one is expressed, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/17-18.htm">Genesis 17:18</a>, by &#1506;&#1512;&#1489; &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;. The phrase &#1506;&#1512;&#1489; &#1500; is not elsewhere met with, and is thus questionable. If we look to <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/6-3.htm">Proverbs 6:3</a>, the &#1512;&#1506; (&#1512;&#1506;&#1492;) mentioned there cannot possibly be the creditor with whom one has become surety, for so impetuous and urgent an application to him would be both purposeless and unbecoming. But if he is meant for whom one has become surety, then certainly &#1500;&#1512;&#1506;&#1498; is also to be understood of the same person, and &#1500; is thus dat. commodi; similar to this is the Targumic &#1506;&#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1488; &#1506;&#1500;, suretyship for any one, <a href="/proverbs/17-18.htm">Proverbs 17:18</a>; <a href="/proverbs/22-26.htm">Proverbs 22:26</a>. But is the &#1494;&#1512;, 1b, distinguished from &#1512;&#1506;&#1498;, the stranger with whom one has become surety? The parallels <a href="/proverbs/11-15.htm">Proverbs 11:15</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/20-16.htm">Proverbs 20:16</a>, where &#1494;&#1512; denotes the person whom one represents, show that in both lines one and the same person is meant; &#1494;&#1512; is in the Proverbs equivalent to &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;, each different from the person in the discourse, <a href="/proverbs/5-17.htm">Proverbs 5:17</a>; <a href="/proverbs/27-2.htm">Proverbs 27:2</a> - thus, like &#1512;&#1506;&#1498;, denotes not the friend, but generally him to whom one stands in any kind of relation, even a very external one, in a word, the fellow-creatures or neighbours, <a href="/proverbs/24-28.htm">Proverbs 24:28</a> (cf. the Arab. sahbk and k&#803;arynk, which are used as vaguely and superficially). It is further a question, whether we have to explain 1b: if thou hast given thine hand to another, or for another. Here also we are without evidence from the usage of the language; for the phrase &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1506; &#1499;&#1468;&#1507;, or merely &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1506;, appears to be used of striking the hand in suretyship where it elsewhere occurs without any further addition, <a href="/proverbs/17-18.htm">Proverbs 17:18</a>; <a href="/proverbs/22-26.htm">Proverbs 22:26</a>; <a href="/proverbs/11-15.htm">Proverbs 11:15</a>; however, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/17-3.htm">Job 17:3</a>, &#1504;&#1514;&#1511;&#1506; &#1500;&#1497;&#1491; appears the same: to strike into the hand of any one, i.e., to give to him the hand-stroke. From this passage Hitzig concludes that the surety gave the hand-stroke, without doubt in the presence of witnesses, first of all of the creditor, to the debtor, as a sign that he stood for him. But this idea is unnatural, and the "without doubt" melts into air. He on whose hand the stroke falls is always the person to whom one gives suretyship, and confirms it by the hand-stroke. Job also, l.c., means to say: who else but Thou, O Lord, could give to me a pledge, viz., of my innocence? If now the &#1494;&#1512;, v. 1b, is, as we have shown, not the creditor,<p>(Note: A translation by R. Joseph Joel of Fulda, 1787, whose autograph MS Baer possesses, renders the passage not badly thus: - "My son, if thou hast become surety for thy friend, and hast given the hand to another, then thou art bound by thy word, held by thy promise. Yet do what I say to thee, my son: Be at pains as soon as thou canst to get free, otherwise thou art in the power of thy friend; shun no trouble, be urgent with thy friend.")<p>continued...</body></html>
