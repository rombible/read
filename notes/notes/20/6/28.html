Let not faithful reproofs ever make us uneasy. When we consider how much this sin abounds, how heinous adultery is in its own nature, of what evil consequence it is, and how certainly it destroys the spiritual life in the soul, we shall not wonder that the cautions against it are so often repeated. Let us notice the subjects of this chapter. Let us remember Him who willingly became our Surety, when we were strangers and enemies. And shall Christians, who have such prospects, motives, and examples, be slothful and careless? Shall we neglect what is pleasing to God, and what he will graciously reward? May we closely watch every sense by which poison can enter our minds or affections.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The two forms of evil bring, each of them, their own penalty. By the one a man is brought to such poverty as to beg for "a piece of bread" (compare <a href="/1_samuel/2-36.htm">1 Samuel 2:36</a>): by the other and more deadly sin he incurs a peril which may affect his life.

The repeated question is introduced by gin, "if," here equivalent to the Latin an, used in double questions, as in <a href="/genesis/24-21.htm">Genesis 24:21</a>; <a href="/exodus/17-7.htm">Exodus 17:7</a>; <a href="/judges/9-2.htm">Judges 9:2</a>, etc. Go; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> <span class="accented">walk upon hot coals</span> (Hebrew, <span class="accented">al-haggekalim</span>); literally, <span class="accented">upon the hot coals.</span> The Hebrew <span class="accented">gakheleth</span> is coals thoroughly ignited, as in <a href="/leviticus/16-12.htm">Leviticus 16:12</a> and <a href="/proverbs/25-22.htm">Proverbs 25:22</a>; different from <span class="accented">pekham</span> of <a href="/proverbs/26-21.htm">Proverbs 26:21</a>, which is "a black coal," or, as Gesenius explains, charcoal unkindled. <span class="cmt_word">Be burned</span>; Hebrew, <span class="accented">tikkaveynah</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> be burned or scorched so as to leave a mark by burning, as in <a href="/isaiah/43-2.htm">Isaiah 43:2</a>; this being the force of the verb <span class="accented">kavah</span>. The flames of lust will certainly be visited with punishment, and with the stings of conscience. Job, speaking on this very subject, says a deviation from the paths of virtue "is a fire that consumeth to destruction." And to him who gives way to adultery it may be said, in the words of Horace, though with a different application from that in which they were used by that poet, "incedis per ignes suppositos cineri doloso."

The futures are not expressive of a wish or of an admonition, but of a promise; the form of the third clause shows this.
