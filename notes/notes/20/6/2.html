We are stewards of our worldly substance, and have to answer to the Lord for our disposal of it; to waste it in rash schemes, or such plans as may entangle us in difficulties and temptations, is wrong. A man ought never to be surety for more than he is able and willing to pay, and can afford to pay, without wronging his family; he ought to look upon every sum he is engaged for, as his own debt. If we must take all this care to get our debts to men forgiven, much more to obtain forgiveness with God. Humble thyself to him, make sure of Christ as thy Friend, to plead for thee; pray earnestly that thy sins may be pardoned, and that thou mayest be kept from going down to the pit.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Or, "If thou art snared ... if thou art taken," etc. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 6<p>Pr 6:1-35.

The Authorized Version rightly regards this as the conclusion. So the Vulgate. Others, however, carry on the hypothesis, and insert <span class="accented">im</span>, "if:" "If thou art snared," etc.; but without warrant (Zockler, Wordsworth, Plumptre). The LXX. throws the thought into the form of a proverb, as "a strong net to a man are his own words." A distinction is to be drawn between the verbs rendered "entangled" and "taken;" the former, <span class="accented">yakosh</span>, signifying to be taken unwarily, off one's guard; the latter, <span class="accented">lakad</span>, referring, as before observed (cf. <a href="/proverbs/5-22.htm">Proverbs 5:22</a>), to the being stricken with the net. They are found in the same collocation in <a href="/isaiah/8-15.htm">Isaiah 8:15</a>, "Many among them shall be <span class="accented">snared</span> and <span class="accented">taken."</span> The repetition of the phrase, "with the words of thy mouth," is not unintentional or purely rhetorical. It is made, as Delitzsch observes, to bring with greater force to the mind that the entanglements in which the surety is involved are the result of his own indiscretion. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The subject, 19a, set forth as a theme courts love for her who is to be loved, for she presents herself as lovely. &#1488;&#1497;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514; is the female of the stag, which may derive its name &#1488;&#1497;&#1468;&#1500; from the weapon-power of its horns, and &#1497;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492; (from &#1497;&#1506;&#1500;, Arab. w'al, to climb), that of the wild-goat (&#1497;&#1506;&#1500;); and thus properly, not the gazelle, which is called &#1510;&#1489;&#1497; on account of its elegance, but the chamois. These animals are commonly used in Semitic poetry as figures of female beauty on account of the delicate beauty of their limbs and their sprightly black eyes. &#1488;&#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; signifies always sensual love, and is interchanged in this erotic meaning (<a href="/proverbs/7-18.htm">Proverbs 7:18</a>) with &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;. In 19b the predicate follows the subject. The Graec. Venet. translates as if the word were &#1491;&#1493;&#1491;&#1497;&#1492;, and the Syr. as if it were &#1491;&#1512;&#1499;&#1497;&#1492;, but Aquila rightly translates &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2;. As &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; is derived (vid., Curtius, Griech. Etymologie, Nr. 307) from dha&#770;, to suck (causative, with anu, to put to sucking), so &#1491;&#1468;&#1491;, &#1513;&#1473;&#1491;, &#1514;&#1468;&#1491;, Arab. thady (commonly in dual thadjein), from &#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1492;, Arab. thdy, rigare, after which also the verb &#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498; is chosen: she may plentifully give thee to drink; figuratively equivalent to, refresh or (what the Aram. &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1497; precisely means) fascinate<p>(Note: Many editions have here &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;; but this Dagesh, which is contrary to rule, is to be effaced.)<p>thee, satisfy thee with love. &#1491;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; also is an erotic word, which besides in this place is found only in Ezekiel (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-3.htm">Ezekiel 23:3</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-8.htm">Ezekiel 23:8</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/23-21.htm">Ezekiel 23:21</a>). The lxx obliterates the strong sensual colouring of this line. In 19c it changes &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1490;&#1468;&#1492; into &#1514;&#1513;&#1474;&#1490;&#1492;, &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#837;, perhaps also because the former appeared to be too sensual. Moses ha-Darshan (in Rashi) proposes to explain it after the Arab. sjy, to cover, to cast over, to come over anything (III  equals  &#1506;&#1505;&#1511;, to employ oneself with something): engage thyself with her love, i.e., be always devoted to her in love. And Immanuel himself, the author of a Hebrew Divan expatiating with unparalleled freedom in erotic representations, remarks, while he rightly understands &#1514;&#1513;&#1473;&#1490;&#1492; of the fascination of love: &#1511;&#1493;&#1512;&#1488; &#1492;&#1514;&#1502;&#1491;&#1514; &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1493; &#1488;&#1508;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493; &#1489;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1493; &#1513;&#1473;&#1490;&#1490;&#1492;, he calls the husband's continual caressing of the wife an error. But this moral side-glance lies here at a distance from the poet. He speaks here of a morally permissible love-ecstasy, or rather, since &#1514;&#1502;&#1497;&#1491; excludes that which is extraordinary, of an intensity of love connected with the feeling of superabundant happiness. &#1513;&#1473;&#1490;&#1492; properly signifies to err from the way, therefore figuratively, with &#1489; of a matter, like delirare ea, to be wholly captivated by her, so that one is no longer in his own power, can no longer restrain himself - the usual word for the intoxication of love and of wine, <a href="/proverbs/20-1.htm">Proverbs 20:1</a> (Fl.).</body></html>
