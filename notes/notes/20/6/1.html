The only occasion for loans would be to supply the immediate necessities of the borrower, and the exaction of interest under such circumstances would be productive of great hardship, involving the loss of land and even personal freedom, as the insolvent debtor and his family became the slaves of the creditor (<a href="/context/nehemiah/5-1.htm" title="And there was a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brothers the Jews.">Nehemiah 5:1-5</a>). To prevent these evils, the lending of money on interest to any poor Israelite was strictly forbidden (<a href="/context/leviticus/25-35.htm" title="And if your brother be waxen poor, and fallen in decay with you; then you shall relieve him: yes, though he be a stranger, or a sojourner; that he may live with you.">Leviticus 25:35-37</a>); the people were enjoined to be liberal, and lend for nothing in such cases. But at the time of Solomon, when the commerce of the Israelites had enormously developed, and communications were opened with Spain and Egypt and (possibly) with India and Ceylon, while caravans penetrated beyond the Euphrates, then the lending of money on interest for employment in trade most probably became frequent, and suretyship also, the pledging of a man’s own credit to enable his friend to procure a loan. And when the wealth that accompanied this development of the national resources had brought luxury in its train, borrowing and suretyship would be employed for less worthy purposes, to supply the young nobles of Jerusalem with money for their extravagance.

We are stewards of our worldly substance, and have to answer to the Lord for our disposal of it; to waste it in rash schemes, or such plans as may entangle us in difficulties and temptations, is wrong. A man ought never to be surety for more than he is able and willing to pay, and can afford to pay, without wronging his family; he ought to look upon every sum he is engaged for, as his own debt. If we must take all this care to get our debts to men forgiven, much more to obtain forgiveness with God. Humble thyself to him, make sure of Christ as thy Friend, to plead for thee; pray earnestly that thy sins may be pardoned, and that thou mayest be kept from going down to the pit.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Surety - The "pledge," or security for payment, which, for example, David was to bring back from his brothers <a href="/1_samuel/17-18.htm">1 Samuel 17:18</a>. So the word was used in the primitive trade transactions of the early Israelites.<p>In the warnings against this suretyship, in the Book of Proverbs, we may trace the influence of contact with the Phoenicians. The merchants of Tyre and Zidon seem to have discovered the value of credit as an element of wealth. A man might obtain goods, or escape the pressure of a creditor at an inconvenient season, or obtain a loan on more favorable terms, by finding security. To give such security might be one of the kindest offices which one friend could render to another. Side by side, however, with a legitimate system of credit there sprang up, as in later times, a fraudulent counterfeit. Phoenician or Jewish money-lenders (the "stranger") were ready to make their loans to the spendthrift. He was equally ready to find a companion (the "friend") who would become his surety. It was merely a form, just writing a few words, just "a clasping of the hands" (see the marginal reference) in token that the obligation was accepted, and that was all. It would be unfriendly to refuse. And yet, as the teacher warns his hearers, there might be, in that moment of careless weakness, the first link of a long chain of ignominy, galling, fretting, wearing, depriving life of all its peace. The Jewish law of debt, hard and stern like that of most ancient nations, aright be enforced against him in all its rigour. Money and land might go, the very bed under him might be seized, and his garment torn from his back <a href="/proverbs/20-16.htm">Proverbs 20:16</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/22-27.htm">Proverbs 22:27</a>, the older and more lenient law <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/22-25.htm">Exodus 22:25-27</a> having apparently fallen into disuse. he might be brought into a life-long bondage, subject only to the possible relief of the year of jubilee, when the people were religious enough to remember and observe it.

It is a rash and inconsiderate entering into suretyship that is here cautioned against; doing it without inquiring into, and having sufficient knowledge of the person engaged for; and without considering whether able to answer the obligation, if required, without hurting a man's self and family; otherwise suretyship may lawfully be entered into, and good be done by it, and no hurt to the surety himself and family.

In earlier and simpler times it was enough for the Law to forbid usury or interest for a loan of money to be exacted by one Israelite of another; and raiment given as a pledge or security for a debt was to be returned before night-fall to be the owner’s covering in his sleep (<a href="/context/exodus/22-25.htm" title="If you lend money to any of my people that is poor by you, you shall not be to him as an usurer, neither shall you lay on him usury....">Exodus 22:25-27</a>; <a href="/context/leviticus/25-35.htm" title="And if your brother be waxen poor, and fallen in decay with you; then you shall relieve him: yes, though he be a stranger, or a sojourner; that he may live with you....">Leviticus 25:35-38</a>). With the developement, however, of commerce and the growth of luxury under Solomon, money-lending transactions, whether for speculation in trade, or for personal gratification, had come to be among the grave dangers that beset the path of youth. Accordingly, though the writer of Ecclesiasticus contents himself with laying down restrictions to the exercise of suretiship, and even goes the length of telling us that “An honest man is surety for his neighbor” (<a href="//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/8-13.htm" title="Be not surety above thy power: for if thou be surety, take care to pay it.">Sir 8:13</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/29-14.htm" title="An honest man is surety for his neighbour: but he that is impudent will forsake him....">Sir 29:14-20</a>), our writer here, with a truer insight, has no quarter for it, but condemns it unsparingly on every mention of it (<a href="/context/proverbs/6-1.htm" title="My son, if you be surety for your friend, if you have stricken your hand with a stranger,...">Proverbs 6:1-5</a>, <a href="/proverbs/11-15.htm" title="He that is surety for a stranger shall smart for it: and he that hates indebtedness is sure.">Proverbs 11:15</a>, <a href="/proverbs/17-18.htm" title="A man void of understanding strikes hands, and becomes surety in the presence of his friend.">Proverbs 17:18</a>, <a href="/proverbs/20-16.htm" title="Take his garment that is surety for a stranger: and take a pledge of him for a strange woman.">Proverbs 20:16</a>, <a href="/context/proverbs/22-26.htm" title="Be not you one of them that strike hands, or of them that are sureties for debts....">Proverbs 22:26-27</a>, <a href="/proverbs/27-13.htm" title="Take his garment that is surety for a stranger, and take a pledge of him for a strange woman.">Proverbs 27:13</a>).

The subjects treated of are <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> suretyship (vers. 1-5); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> sloth (vers. 6-11); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> malice (vers. 12-19); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> adultery (ver. 20 to the end). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The continuity of the subject treated of in the preceding chapter appears to be somewhat abruptly interrupted to make way for the insertion of three discourses on subjects which apparently have little connection with what precedes and what follows. Their unlooked for and unexpected appearance has led Hitzig to regard them as interpolations, but it has been conclusively pointed out by Delitzsch that there is sufficient internal evidence, in the grammatical construction, figures, word formations, delineations, and threatenings, to establish the position that they proceeded from the same hand that composed the rest of the book and to guarantee their genuineness. But another and not less interesting question arises as to whether any connection subsists between these discourses and the subject which they apparently interrupt. Such a connection is altogether denied by Delitzsch, Zockler, and other German commentators, who look upon them as independent discourses, and maintain that, if there is any connection, it can be only external and accidental. On the other hand, Bishops Patrick and Wordsworth discover an ethical connection which, though not clear at first sight, is not on that account less real or true. The subject treated of in the preceding chapter is the happiness of the married life, and this is imperilled by incautious undertaking of suretyship, and suretyship, it is maintained, induces sloth, while sloth leads to maliciousness After treating of suretyship, sloth, and malice in succession, the teacher recurs to the former subject of his discourse, viz. impurity of life, against which he gives impressive warnings. That such is the true view them appears little doubt. One vice is intimately connected with another, and the verdict of experience is that a life of idleness is one of the most prolific sources of a life of impurity. Hence we find Ovid saying - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Quaeritur, AEgisthus, qua re sit factus adulter?<br />In promptu causa est - desidiosus erat."</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Do you ask why AEgisthus has become an adulterer?<br />The reason is close at hand - he was full of idleness."</span> Within the sphere of these discourses them. selves the internal connection is distinctly observable, vers. 16-19 being a refrain of vers. 12-15, and the phrase, "to stir up strife," closing each enumeration (see vers. 14 and 19). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-5.</span> - 9. <span class="accented">Ninth admonitory discourse. Warning against suretyship.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - The contents of this section are  not to be taken so much as an absolute unqualified prohibition of suretyship as counsel directed against the inconsiderate and rash undertaking of such an obligation. There were some occasions on which becoming surety for another was demanded by the laws of charity and prudence, and when it was not inconsistent with the humane precepts of the Mosaic Law as enunciated in <a href="/leviticus/19-19.htm">Leviticus 19:19</a>. In other passages of our book the writer of the Proverbs lays down maxims which would clearly countenance the practice (<a href="/proverbs/14-21.htm">Proverbs 14:21</a>; <a href="/proverbs/17-17.htm">Proverbs 17:17</a>; <a href="/proverbs/18-24.htm">Proverbs 18:24</a>; <a href="/proverbs/27-10.htm">Proverbs 27:10</a>), and in the apocryphal writings the practice is encouraged, if not enjoined (Ecclus. 29:14 Ecclus. 8:13). Notwithstanding this limitation, however, it is observable that suretyship is almost invariably spoken of in terms of condemnation, and the evil consequences which it entailed on the surety may be the reason why it is so frequently alluded to. The teacher refers to the subject in the following passages: here; <a href="/proverbs/11-15.htm">Proverbs 11:15</a>: 17:18; 22:26; 20:16; 27:13. <span class="cmt_word">My son</span>. On this address, see <a href="/proverbs/2-1.htm">Proverbs 2:1</a>; <a href="/proverbs/3-1.htm">Proverbs 3:1, 17</a>. <span class="cmt_word">If thou be surety</span> (Hebrew, <span class="accented">im-aravta</span>); literally, <span class="accented">if thou hast become surety</span>; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">si spoponderis.</span> What the teacher counsels in the present instance is that, if by inadvertence a person has become surety, he should by the most strenuous endeavours prevail on his friend to free him from the bond. The Hebrew verb <span class="accented">arav</span> is properly "to mix," and then signifies "to become surety" in the sense of interchanging with another and so taking his place. The frequent mention of suretyship in the Proverbs is alluded to above. The first recorded instances are those where Judah offers to become surety for Benjamin, first to Israel (<a href="/genesis/43-9.htm">Genesis 43:9</a>), and secondly to Joseph (<a href="/genesis/44-33.htm">Genesis 44:33</a>). It is singular that it is only once alluded to in the Book of Job, where Job says, "Lay down now, put me in surety with thee; who is he that will strike hands with me?" (<a href="/job/17-3.htm">Job 17:3</a>); and once only, and that doubtfully, in the whole of the Mosaic writings, in the phrase <span class="accented">tesummat yad, i.e.</span> giving or striking the hand in the case of perjury (<a href="/leviticus/6-2.htm">Leviticus 6:2</a>). The psalmist refers to it in the words, "Be surety for thy servant for good" (<a href="/psalms/119-122.htm">Psalm 119:122</a>). It is spoken of twice in Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/38-14.htm">Isaiah 38:14</a>; <a href="/isaiah/36-8.htm">Isaiah 36:8</a>), once in Ezekiel (Ezekiel 27:27) and in Nehemiah (<a href="/nehemiah/5-3.htm">Nehemiah 5:3</a>), and the cognate noun, <span class="accented">arrabon</span>, "the pledge," security for payment, is met with in <a href="/genesis/38-17.htm">Genesis 38:17</a> and <a href="/1_samuel/17-18.htm">1 Samuel 17:18</a>. These scattered notices in the Old Testament show that the practice was always in existence, while the more frequent notices in the Proverbs refer to a condition of society where extended commercial transactions had apparently made it a thing of daily occurrence, and a source of constant danger. In the New Testament one instance of suretyship is found, when St. Paul offers to become surety to Philemon for Onesimus (<a href="/philemon/1-19.htm">Philemon 1:19</a>). But in the language of the New Testament, the purely commercial meaning of the word is transmuted into a spiritual one. The gift of the Spirit is regarded as the <span class="accented">arrabon</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;</span>, "the pledge," the earnest of the Christian believer's acceptance with God (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-22.htm">2 Corinthians 1:22</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-5.htm">2 Corinthians 5:5</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-14.htm">Ephesians 1:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For thy friend;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">l'reeka.</span> The Hebrew <span class="accented">reeh</span>, more usually <span class="accented">rea</span>, is "the companion or friend," and in this case obviously the debtor for whom one has become surety. The word reappears in ver. 3. The <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;</span> (<span class="accented">l</span>) prefixed to <span class="accented">reeh</span> is the <span class="accented">dativus commodi.</span> So Delitzsch and others. If not in the original, but rightly inserted. <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger</span> (Hebrew, <span class="accented">taka'ta lazzar kapeyka</span>); properly, <span class="accented">thou hast stricken thy hand for a stranger.</span> The analogous use of <span class="accented">l</span>' (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;</span>) in <span class="accented">lazzar</span> determines this rendering. As in the corresponding <span class="accented">l'reeyka</span>, the <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;</span> (<span class="accented">l</span>) indicates the person for whose benefit the suretyship is undertaken, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the debtor, and not the person <span class="accented">with</span> whom the symbolical act is performed, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the creditor. Compare the following passages, though the construction with <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;</span> is wanting: "He that is surety for a stranger" (<a href="/proverbs/11-15.htm">Proverbs 11:15</a>); "Take his garment that is surety for a stranger" (<a href="/proverbs/20-16.htm">Proverbs 20:16</a> and Proverbs 27:13). "The stranger," <span class="accented">zar</span>, is not an alien, or one belonging to another nationality, but simply one extraneous to one's self, and so equivalent to <span class="accented">akher</span>, "another." The meaning, therefore, seems to be, "If thou hast entered into a bond for one with whom thou art but slightly acquainted." Others (Wordsworth, Plumptre), however, take <span class="accented">zar</span> as representing the foreign money lender. The phrase, "to strike the hand," <span class="accented">taka kaph</span>, or simply "to strike," <span class="accented">taka</span>, describes the symbolical act which accompanied the contract. <span class="accented">Taka is</span> properly "to drive," like the Latin <span class="accented">defigere</span>, and hence "to strike," and indicates the sharp sound with which the hands were brought into contact. The act no doubt was accomplished before witnesses, and the hand which was stricken was that of the creditor, who thereby received assurance that the responsibility of the debtor was undertaken by the surety. The "striking of the hand" as indicating the completion of a contract is illustrated by the author of the 'Kamoos' (quoted by Lee, on <a href="/job/17-3.htm">Job 17:3</a>), who says, "He struck or clapped to him a sale...  he struck his hand in a sale, or on his hand...  he struck his ow hand upon the hand of him, and this is among the necessary (transactions) of sale." So among  Western nations the giving of the band has been always regarded as a pledge of <span class="accented">bona fides.</span> Thus Menelaus demands of Helena (Euripides, 'Hel.,' 838), <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c3;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;</span>, "Touch my right hand now on these conditions," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in attestation that you accept them. In purely verbal agreements it is the custom in the present day for the parties to clasp the hand. A further example may be found in the plighting of troth in the Marriage Service. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>With <a href="/proverbs/5-18.htm">Proverbs 5:18</a> is introduced anew the praise of conjugal love.

It is the fountain of the birth that is meant (cf. &#1502;&#1511;&#1493;&#1512; of the female &#1506;&#1512;&#1493;&#1492;, e.g., <a href="/leviticus/20-18.htm">Leviticus 20:18</a>), not the procreation (lxx, &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3c6;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c8;, viz., &#x3c6;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#768;&#x3c8; &#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;); the blessing wished for by him is the blessing of children, which &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498; so much the more distinctly denotes if &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498;, Arab. barak, means to spread out, and &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; thus to cause a spreading out. The &#1502;&#1503;, 18b, explains itself from the idea of drawing (water), given with the figure of a fountain; the word &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514; found in certain codices is, on the contrary, prosaic (Fl.). Whilst &#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1495; &#1502;&#1503; is found elsewhere (<a href="/ecclesiastes/2-20.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:20</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/20-27.htm">2 Chronicles 20:27</a>) as meaning almost the same as &#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1495; &#1489;&#1468;; the former means rejoicing from some place, the latter in something. In the genitive connection, "wife of thy youth" (cf. <a href="/proverbs/2-17.htm">Proverbs 2:17</a>), both of these significations lie: thy youthful wife, and she who was chosen by thee in thy youth, according as we refer the suffix to the whole idea or only to the second member of the chain of words.</body></html>
