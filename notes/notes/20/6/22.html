Let not faithful reproofs ever make us uneasy. When we consider how much this sin abounds, how heinous adultery is in its own nature, of what evil consequence it is, and how certainly it destroys the spiritual life in the soul, we shall not wonder that the cautions against it are so often repeated. Let us notice the subjects of this chapter. Let us remember Him who willingly became our Surety, when we were strangers and enemies. And shall Christians, who have such prospects, motives, and examples, be slothful and careless? Shall we neglect what is pleasing to God, and what he will graciously reward?

Though only specifying three conditions, they refer to the whole conduct of life, and hence the verse promises direction, guardianship, and converse of wisdom, which will undoubtedly attend life where the precepts of parents are lovingly treasured and obediently observed. The Authorized Version conveys the impression that it is "the keeping" of the parents' precepts, etc., which is to bear such results; but it is better to  understand "it" as signifying the whole teaching or doctrine of wisdom, as Delitzsch. Wisdom becomes personified in the representation, and identified with her teaching. <span class="cmt_word">It shall</span> <span class="cmt_word">lead thee.</span> The Hebrew verb <span class="accented">nakhah</span>, "to lead," in the sense of "to direct," like the Latin <span class="accented">dirigere</span> (Delitzsch), and as it is used in Exodus and Numbers, <span class="accented">passim.</span> In the Psalms (<a href="/psalms/5-9.htm">Psalm 5:9</a>; <a href="/psalms/27-11.htm">Psalm 27:11</a>; <a href="/psalms/31-4.htm">Psalm 31:4</a>, etc.) it is employed of God as governing men. Hence, in the affairs of life, Wisdom will so guide and control us that we shall act uprightly. There is the further notion imported into the word of preservation from evil (cf. <a href="/proverbs/3-23.htm">Proverbs 3:23</a>, "Thou shalt walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not stumble"). <span class="cmt_word">When thou</span> <span class="cmt_word">sleepest;</span> or, <span class="accented">when thou liest down</span>, as in <a href="/proverbs/3-25.htm">Proverbs 3:25</a>, where the same verb occurs. <span class="cmt_word">It shall keep thee;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> watch over, keep safe, or preserve; as in the Vulgate, <span class="accented">custodire</span>, and the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>.

The hiph. form, <span class="accented">hekitz</span>, is intransitive, "to be aroused" (cf. the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x1ff3;</span>)<span class="accented">. <span class="cmt_word"></span>It shall talk with thee;</span> rather, <span class="accented">she.</span> Bertheau renders, "She will make thee thoughtful;" and Dathe, "Let them be thy meditation;" but the accusative suffix designates the person who is the object of the action of the verb, as in <a href="/psalms/5-5.htm">Psalm 5:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/42-4.htm">Psalm 42:4</a>; <a href="/zechariah/7-5.htm">Zechariah 7:5</a> (Zockler) and as Delitzseh remarks, the personification requires something more than a mere meditation with one's self on the precepts of Wisdom. Wisdom herself shall hold converse with thee (cf. the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>), she shall suggest thoughts how thou art to behave thyself. The meaning of the verb, "to meditate," "to think deeply," however, need not be lost sight of. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>What now follows is not a separate section (Hitzig), but the corroborative continuation of that which precedes. The last word (&#1502;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, strife) before the threatening of punishment, 14b, is also here the last. The thought that no vice is a greater abomination to God than the (in fact satanical) striving to set men at variance who love one another, clothes itself in the form of the numerical proverb which we have already considered, pp. 12, 13. From that place we transfer the translation of this example of a Midda: - <p>16 There are six things which Jahve hateth,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And seven are an abhorrence to His soul:<p>17 Haughty eyes, a lying tongue,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And hands that shed innocent blood;<p>18 An heart that deviseth the thoughts of evil,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Feet that hastily run to wickedness,<p>19 One that uttereth lies as a false witness,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And he who soweth strife between brethren.<p>The sense is not, that the six things are hateful to God, and the seventh an abomination to Him besides (Lwenstein); the Midda-form in <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/1-3.htm">Amos 1:3-2:6</a>, and in the proverb in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/5-19.htm">Job 5:19</a>, shows that the seven are to be numbered separately, and the seventh is the non plus ultra of all that is hated by God. We are not to translate: sex haecce odit, for &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;, &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;, (&#1492;&#1501;, &#1492;&#1503;) points backwards and hitherwards, but not, as &#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;, forwards to that immediately following; in that case the words would be &#1513;&#1473;&#1513;&#1473; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;, or more correctly &#1492;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492; &#1513;&#1473;&#1513;&#1473;. But also Hitzig's explanation, "These six things (viz., <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/6-12.htm">Proverbs 6:12-15</a>) Jahve hateth," is impossible; for (which is also against that haecce) the substantive pronoun &#1492;&#1502;&#1492; nuonorp , &#1492;&#1504;&#1492; (&#1492;&#1492;&#1502;&#1492;, &#1492;&#1492;&#1504;&#1492;) is never, like the Chald. &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1503; (&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;), employed as an accus. in the sense of &#1488;&#1514;&#1492;&#1501;, &#1488;&#1514;&#1492;&#1503;, it is always (except where it is the virtual gen. connected with a preposition) only the nom., whether of the subject or of the predicate; and where it is the nom. of the predicate, as <a href="/deuteronomy/20-15.htm">Deuteronomy 20:15</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/51-19.htm">Isaiah 51:19</a>, substantival clauses precede in which &#1492;&#1504;&#1492; (&#1492;&#1502;&#1492;) represents the substantive verb, or, more correctly, in which the logical copula resulting from the connection of the clause itself remains unexpressed. Accordingly, '&#1513;&#1474;&#1504;&#1488; &#1492; is a relative clause, and is therefore so accentuated here, as at <a href="/proverbs/30-15.htm">Proverbs 30:15</a> and elsewhere: sex (sunt) ea quae Deus odit, et septem (sunt) abominatio animae ejus. Regarding the statement that the soul of God hates anything, vid., at <a href="/isaiah/1-14.htm">Isaiah 1:14</a>. &#1514;&#1493;&#1506;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;, an error in the writing occasioned by the numeral (vid., <a href="/proverbs/26-25.htm">Proverbs 26:25</a>), is properly corrected by the Ker&#305;&#770;; the poet had certainly the singular in view, as <a href="/proverbs/3-32.htm">Proverbs 3:32</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/11-1.htm">Proverbs 11:1</a>, when he wrote &#1514;&#1493;&#1506;&#1489;&#1514;. The first three characteristics are related to each other as mental, verbal, actual, denoted by the members of the body by means of which these characteristics come to light. The virtues are taken all together as a body (organism), and meekness is its head. Therefore there stands above all, as the sin of sins, the mentis elatae tumor, which expresses itself in elatum (grande) supercilium: &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; &#1512;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, the feature of the &#1512;&#1501;, haughty (cf. <a href="/psalms/18-28.htm">Psalm 18:28</a> with <a href="/2_samuel/22-28.htm">2 Samuel 22:28</a>), is the opposite of the feature of the &#1513;&#1473;&#1495; &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="/job/22-29.htm">Job 22:29</a>; &#1506;&#1497;&#1503; is in the O.T. almost always (vid., Sol 4:9) fem., and adjectives of course form no dual. The second of these characteristics is the lying tongue, and the third the murderous hands. &#1491;&#1468;&#1501;&#1470;&#1504;&#1511;&#1497; is innocent blood as distinguished from &#1491;&#1468;&#1501; &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1511;&#1497;, the blood of the innocent, <a href="/deuteronomy/19-13.htm">Deuteronomy 19:13</a>.<p>(Note: The writing &#1491;&#1468;&#1501; follows the Masoretic rule, vid., Kimchi, Michlol 205b, and Heidenheim under <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-10.htm">Deuteronomy 19:10</a>, where in printed editions of the text (also in Norzi's) the irregular form &#1491;&#1468;&#1501; &#1504;&#1511;&#1497; is found. Besides, the Metheg is to be given to &#1491;&#1468;&#1501;&#1470;, so that one may not read it dom, as e.g., &#1513;&#1473;&#1513;&#1473;&#1470;&#1502;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/7-11.htm">Genesis 7:11</a>, that one may not read it &#1513;&#1473;&#1513;&#1473;&#1470;.)</body></html>
