Some persons think that the word <span class="ital">seven-fold </span>is only used as an indefinite number, meaning he shall restore the value of that which he hath taken, and much more. Others think that, as thefts were multiplied, so the punishment of them was increased in Solomon’s time; or, at least, that it was the practice of some nations to require this seven-fold restitution. Some again have thought (which seems most probable) that he speaks not of that restitution which the law required, but of that which either the wronged person might force the thief to make, or which the thief would willingly give rather than be exposed to public shame. <span class="ital">But whoso committeth adultery lacketh understanding </span>— Shows still greater folly; for, if he is found out, he is not punished in his estate only, but with loss of life; for if a theft, occasioned by hunger, is so punished, how much more severely shall the adulterer be punished, who robs a man of what is so much more valuable and dear to him than any part of his property, even of his wife, without any such necessity. He is indeed a brutish and silly man who madly rushes upon those filthy courses without any sense or consideration of the horrid shame and certain destruction which attend upon them. <span class="ital">He that doeth it — </span>That commits such a crime; <span class="ital">destroyeth his own soul — </span>Not only his <span class="ital">life, </span>but his <span class="ital">soul: </span>he is guilty, not only of self-murder, but of soul-murder. <span class="ital">A wound and dishonour shall he get — </span>Evil or corporeal punishment from the magistrate, or rather from the woman’s husband, as it follows. <span class="ital">And his reproach shall not be wiped away — </span>Although it should be forgiven by God, yet the reproach and scandal of it will remain. <span class="ital">For jealousy is the rage of a man — </span>It inflames a man with rage and fury against the adulterer. <span class="ital">Therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance — </span>When he has an opportunity to avenge himself upon the delinquent. <span class="ital">He will not regard any ransom — </span>Though the adulterer may be willing to expiate his crime, and redeem his life at any rate, it will not be accepted: the largest gifts will be refused, and nothing will satisfy the injured husband but the death of the person who hath injured him so deeply. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:20-35 The word of God has something to say to us upon all occasions.

When we consider how much this sin abounds, how heinous adultery is in its own nature, of what evil consequence it is, and how certainly it destroys the spiritual life in the soul, we shall not wonder that the cautions against it are so often repeated. Let us notice the subjects of this chapter. Let us remember Him who willingly became our Surety, when we were strangers and enemies. And shall Christians, who have such prospects, motives, and examples, be slothful and careless? Shall we neglect what is pleasing to God, and what he will graciously reward?

They do not discommend or reproach him for it, or fix a mark of infamy upon him, or expose him to public shame by whipping him; but rather excuse him and pity him when it appears what his case is, what put him upon it, and that he had no other intention in it than to do as follows; <p>to satisfy his soul; his craving appetite for food, having nothing to eat, nor no other way of getting any: the words should be supplied thus, "for he does this to satisfy his soul"; or, as the Syriac version, "for he steals to satisfy his soul": and so they are a reason why men do not despise him, nor use him ill, because it is done with no other view; not with a wicked design to hurt his neighbour, nor with a covetous intent to increase his own substance in an unlawful way, but only to satisfy nature in distress; and another reason follows, or the former confirmed; <p>when he is hungry; or for "he is hungry" (s); pressed with famine; the temptation is great, nature urges him to it; and though it is criminal, men in such cases wilt not bear hard upon him for it. The Targum is, <p>"it is not to be wondered at in a thief that he should steal to satisfy his soul when it is hungry.'' <p>The Vulgate Latin version is, <p>"it is not a great fault when anyone steals, for he steals to fill a hungry soul;'' <p>it is a fault, but it is not a very heinous one, at least it is not so heinous as adultery, for the sake of which it is mentioned, and with which it is compared: the design of the instance is to show the adultery is far greater than that; and yet in our age we see that the one is severely punished even with death for trifling things, when the other goes unpunished. <p>(s)  "quia esurit", Cocceius, Michaelis. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><i>Men</i> do not <span class="cverse3">{o}</span> despise a thief, if he stealeth to satisfy his <span class="cverse3">{p}</span> soul when he is hungry;</span><p>(o) He does not reprove theft, showing that it is not as abominable as whoredom, for theft can be restored, but adultery is permanent, and death by the law of God.<p>(p) Meaning, for necessity.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/6.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">30</span>. <span class="ital">despise</span>] Some render, <span class="ital">make light of, let go unpunished</span> (“non impunis dimittitur fur,” Maur.). But the proper meaning of the Heb. word is to be retained with A.V. and R.V.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“The argument appears to be this: The thief, driven by hunger to steal, is regarded with pity rather than contempt, and yet is punished for the protection of society; how much more then shall the adulterer be despised as one who ‘lacketh understanding,’ and visited with a punishment for which there is no redemption.” <span class="ital">Rel.

The argument in vers. 30-33 is one <span class="accented">a fortiori</span>. If men do not overlook but severely punish a crime which has been committed under extenuating circumstances, much less will they do so where the crime is of a much graver character and has nothing to excuse it. Theft and adultery are brought into comparison. Theft under all circumstances is a lesser crime than adultery, but here it is minimized to the lowest degree. The case of a man is taken who steals to satisfy his hunger; the extent of the theft cannot be large, but yet he is punished, and called upon to make the amplest restitution. Much more, does the teacher infer, will be the punishment, and equally certain, where adultery is in question, and the crime is of the most heinous character affecting the most precious interests, and indulged in from the lowest of motives. <span class="cmt_word">Men do not despise a thief,</span> etc.; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> they do not condemn him under the circumstances, <span class="accented">non grandis est culpa</span> (Vulgate), "the fault is not a great one;" but they do despise an adulterer - him they hold in contempt as one "who lacketh understanding" and destroyeth his own soul (ver. 32). The verb <span class="accented">buz</span> has, however, been otherwise rendered as "to overlook." Zockler and Holden explain, "men do not overlook," though the former gives the literal sense as "men do not despise." Gesenius renders "despise," but explains, "<span class="accented">i.e.</span> they do not let him go unpunished." Vatablus, the Versions, Ariae, Montani, and Munsteri, Hitzig, Delitzsch, and Gesenius, Stuart, Muenscher, and Wordsworth, all agree m regarding the proper meaning of the verb to be "to despise" or "to treat scornfully." The verb <span class="accented">buz</span>, moreover, occurs in this sense in <a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>; <a href="/proverbs/11-12.htm">Proverbs 11:12</a>; <a href="/proverbs/13-13.htm">Proverbs 13:13</a>; <a href="/proverbs/14-21.htm">Proverbs 14:21</a>; <a href="/proverbs/23-9.htm">Proverbs 23:9</a>; and <a href="/songs/8-1.htm">Song of Solomon 8:1, 7</a>. Michaelis's explanation is as follows: "although a theft is deservedly regarded as infamous in the commonwealth, nevertheless, if it be compared with adultery, it is less wicked." The rendering of the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3bb;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "it is not a wonder if any thief be taken," it is difficult to reconcile with the text in the original, though it may be explained as expressing the certainty of arrest which follows theft, and thus gives colour to the secondary meaning attached to the verb, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> that of overlooking.
