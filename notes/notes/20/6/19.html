Those sins are in a special manner provoking to God, which are hurtful to the comfort of human life. These things which God hates, we must hate in ourselves; it is nothing to hate them in others.

The expression, "as a false witness," as it appears in the original, is explanatory, and indicates the particular aspect under which the speaking of lies is regarded. Lying in its more general sense has been already spoken of in ver. 17. The vice which is here noted as odious to God is expressly forbidden in the moral code, "Thou shall not bear false witness against thy neighbour" (<a href="/exodus/20-16.htm">Exodus 20:16</a>). But this, though the chief, is only one view of the case. Perjury may be employed, not only in ruining the innocent, but also in screen-tog the guilty. "Much hurt," says Muffet, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>, "doth the deceitful and lying witness, for he corrupteth the judge, oppresseth the innocent, suppresseth the truth, and in the courts of justice sinneth against his own soul and the Lord himself most grievously." "He that speaketh lies as a false witness," again, may be the vile instrument in the hands of unscrupulous and inexorable enemies, as those employed against our Lord and Stephen. Perjury, too, destroys the security of communities. The shipwreck of society which it occasions may be seen in the frightful misery which ensued when the system of <span class="accented">delatores</span> was not only countenanced, but encouraged under the Roman empire. Truly speaking, he that lies as a false witness must be hateful to God. And he that soweth discord among brethren; the seventh and last thing in the enumeration, but not, as Delitzsch holds, the <span class="accented">ne plus ultra</span> of all that is hated of God. It closes, as in ver. 14, the series, but with the addition "among brethren;" thus emphatically stigmatizing the conduct of that man as diabolical who destroys the harmony and unity of those who ought to live together in brotherly affection, and who disturbs the peace of communities. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>&#1511;&#1493;&#1512;&#1509; &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493; is translated according to the sense: who winks (nictat) with his eyes; but that is not the proper meaning of the word, for &#1511;&#1512;&#1509; is used not only of the eyes. <a href="/proverbs/10-10.htm">Proverbs 10:10</a> (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/16-30.htm">Proverbs 16:30</a>, qui oculos morsicat or connivet), <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/35-19.htm">Psalm 35:19</a>, but also of the lips, <a href="/proverbs/16-30.htm">Proverbs 16:30</a>. Thus Lwenstein's explanation: who opens up the eyes, is incorrect. The verb &#1511;&#1512;&#1509; unites in it the meanings of Arab. qrts, to pinch off with a sharp implement, and Arab. qrd, with a blunt instrument (Arab. mik&#803;rad&#803;, pincers). It means to pince, to nip, as Arab. k&#803;ars&#803;, pincer - e.g., k&#803;ars&#803; balskyn alarsasat, he cuts off with the knife the leaden seal - hence frequently, to nip together the eyes, provincially: to wink ("zwickern," frequent. of "zwicken," to nip) with the eyes - the action of the deceiver, who thereby gives the sign to others that they help or at least do not hinder him from bantering and mocking, belying and deceiving a third person (Fl.); cf. Ali's proverb, "O God, pardon to us the culpable winking with the eye (ramzat)," and Fleischer's notes thereon, the Proverbs of Ali, p. 100f.<p>That the words which follow, &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1490;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; &#1502;&#1493;&#1500;&#1500;, are meant of discourse, i.e., the giving of signs, with the feet, and, so to say, significant oratio pedestris (lxx, Aben-Ezra, Bertheau, Hitzig, and others), is very improbable, since the usage of language has set apart the Piel &#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500; for the meaning loqui, and &#1502;&#1493;&#1500;&#1500; admits another suitable signification, for &#1502;&#1493;&#1500;&#1500; means in Talmudic fricare, confricare - e.g., &#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1500;&#1500; &#1502;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514;, he who grinds the parched ears of corn (b. Beza 12b; Ma'seroth, iv. 5) - after which Syr., Targ., &#1514;&#1499;&#1505; (stamping), Aq. &#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;, Symm. &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;, Jerome, (qui) terit pede, and Rashi &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1507; (grinding, scratching); it means one who scrapes with his feet, draws them backwards and forwards on the ground in order thereby to give a sign to others; also the Arab. mll, levem et agilem esse, which as the synonym of Arab. sr is connected with Arab. f&#305;&#770; of the way, signifies properly to move the feet quickly hither and thither (Fl.).<p>(Note: The root-idea of the Arab. mall is unquietness of motion; the Arab. noun mallt signifies the glow with its flickering light and burning: glowing ashes, inner agitation, external haste; Arab. malil (&#1502;&#1500;&#1500;) is the feverish patient, but also one quickly hastening away, and generally an impatient or hasty person (vid., Wetstein in Baudissin in his Job. Tischendorfianus, vii. 6). The grinding is made by means of a quick movement hither and thither; and so also is speaking, for the instrument of speech, particularly the tongue, is set in motion. Only the meaning praecidere, circumcidere, does not connect itself with that root-idea: &#1502;&#1500; in this signification appears to be a nance of &#1502;&#1512;, stringere.)<p>&#1502;&#1512;&#1492; appears here, in accordance with its primary signification (projicere, sc. brachium or digitum  equals  monstrare), connected with &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1510;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493;; another expression for this scornful, malicious &#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd; is &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495; &#1488;&#1510;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;, <a href="/isaiah/58-9.htm">Isaiah 58:9</a>.</body></html>
