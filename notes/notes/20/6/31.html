Aben Ezra observing that double and fivefold being near together in the law, joins them, and so makes sevenfold. Some think Solomon has reference to a law in other nations, which obliged to a sevenfold restoration; or that the penalty was increased in his time, but neither appears; rather the meaning is, that a thief should make restoration according to law as often as he is found guilty, be it seven times, or seventy times seven, <a href="/matthew/18-21.htm">Matthew 18:21</a>; or the sense is, that be should make perfect restoration, full restitution as the law requires: but then this finding: him is not to be understood of finding him in the fact, stealing to satisfy hunger, for then to insist upon a legal restitution, as it is incompatible with such a man's circumstances, so would contradict what is before said, that such an one is not usually reproached and found fault with; but the sense is, if it should be found otherwise, or it should be found that he has food to satisfy his soul, as Gersom observes, and has no need to steal; or if he is found in a man's house, then he shall make restitution as the law directs, even a full one, <a href="/exodus/22-2.htm">Exodus 22:2</a>; <p>he shall give all the substance of his house: to pay the sevenfold, or to make full restitution; nay, if necessary, he himself may be sold, as the above law requires. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the substance of his house.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/6.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">31</span>. <span class="ital">sevenfold</span>] This cannot refer to the legal penalty for theft, which was in no case greater than five times the value of the thing stolen (<a href="/context/exodus/22-1.htm" title="If a man shall steal an ox, or a sheep, and kill it, or sell it; he shall restore five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep....">Exodus 22:1-4</a>.

It had been suggested that the case contemplated in the second clause of the verse is different from that in the first: here is a man, who so far from being driven by abject poverty to steal in order to satisfy his hunger, is able and will be required to pay more than the law demanded (sevenfold) in order to avoid the shame of exposure. It is better, however, to understand <span class="ital">sevenfold</span> as a general term, meaning <span class="ital">in full measure</span> (comp. <a href="/genesis/4-15.htm" title="And the LORD said to him, Therefore whoever slays Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold.

This explanation obviates the objection that if he had to steal for bread he could not pay sevenfold, because the full measure of the law was, “if he have nothing, then he shall be sold for his theft” (<a href="/exodus/22-3.htm" title="If the sun be risen on him, there shall be blood shed for him; for he should make full restitution; if he have nothing, then he shall be sold for his theft.">Exodus 22:3</a>, comp. <a href="/matthew/18-25.htm" title="But for as much as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made.">Matthew 18:25</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But if he be taken, he shill restore sevenfold.</span> Men do not despise the thief, but yet they apprehend him and insist on fullest restitution. <span class="accented">Be found</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> seized (Delitzsch), or legally convicted (Gejerus). <span class="accented">He shall restore</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he must restore (Zockler). Delitzsch, however, understands the future, <span class="accented">y'shalem</span>, as potential, "he may restore." <span class="accented">Sevenfold</span>; Hebrew, <span class="accented">siv'athayim</span>; <span class="accented">LXX.</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">septulum.</span> On this word Geier remarks, "Haec vox nullibi in sacris ponitur pio numero definito;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "It is nowhere put in Scripture for a definite number." It is therefore to be understood indefinitely of complete restitution, or, as it is expressed in the second and parallel clauses, "all the substance of his house." The word is used in this sense in <a href="/genesis/4-24.htm">Genesis 4:24</a>; <a href="/leviticus/26-28.htm">Leviticus 26:28</a>; <a href="/job/5-19.htm">Job 5:19</a> (Lapide). Theft under the Mosaic Law was punishable by a fivefold, fourfold, and twofold restitution (<a href="/exodus/22-1.htm">Exodus 22:1-4, 9</a>), and, in the event of this not forthcoming, the delinquent was to be sold into slavery (Leviticus 25:89). In <a href="/2_samuel/12-6.htm">2 Samuel 12:6</a> a fourfold restitution is mentioned, and in the New Testament Zacchaeus promises to restore fourfold if he could be convicted of fraud (<a href="/luke/19-8.htm">Luke 19:8</a>). In the attempts to reconcile the "sevenfold" of our passage with the requirements of the Mosaic Law, Aben Ezra says that the combined penalties for two cases of theft are contemplated, and others that in the time of the writer the penalties had been increased. But proof of this is wanting. Grotius's explanation is more curious than correct, viz. that if the theft be repeated seven times, and he be "taken" seven times, the thief should only be punished by being forced to make restitution with some addition. Both the Greek and Roman law demanded a twofold restitution. Selden maintains that theft would have been subjected to the usual punishment (Selden, 'De Jure Not. et Gent.,' 6, 100, 6). We may therefore come to the conclusion that "sevenfold" is used in the sense indicated above. As to any objection which may be raised on the seem of inconsistency in talking of a man malting restitution, and giving all his substance when he steals to satisfy his hunger, it may be remarked that he need not necessarily be without substance of some sort or other, and he could acquire subsequently sufficient to satisfy the demand. On the question whether a person is justified by extreme want in stealing, see Grotius, 'De Jure Belli et Pacis,' 2, 100, 2, &sect; 6; Puffendorf, 'De Jure Not. et Gent,' 2, 100, 6, &sect; 5; Blackstone, 'Commentary,' 4:2 &sect; 4. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The proaemium of these twelve proverbial discourses is now at an end.

The warning, "let her not catch thee with her eyelids," refers to her (the adulteress's) coquettish ogling and amorous winking. In the reason added, beginning with &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1489;&#1506;&#1491;&#1470; (thus it is to be punctuated), there is the appositional connection &#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1492; &#1494;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492;, Gesen. 113; the idea of &#1494;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492; goes over into 26b.

But nothing is said here of price (reward); the parallelism is synonymous, not antithetic: he is doubly threatened with loss who enters upon such a course. The adulterer squanders his means (<a href="/proverbs/29-3.htm">Proverbs 29:3</a>) to impoverishment (vid., the mention of a loaf of bread in the description of poverty <a href="/1_samuel/2-36.htm">1 Samuel 2:36</a>), and a man's wife (but at the same time seeking converse with another) makes a prey of a precious soul; for whoever consents to adulterous converse with her, loses not perhaps his means, but certainly freedom, purity, dignity of soul, yea, his own person. &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491; comprehends - as &#1510;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1503;, fisher's town [Zidon], Arab. s&#803;ya&#770;d, hunter and fisher, show - all kinds of hunting, but in Hebr. is used only of the hunting of wild beasts.
