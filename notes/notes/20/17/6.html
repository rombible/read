Ancient parents. Grandfathers with the Jews are called old men, as Buxtorf (d) observes. A numerous progeny was reckoned a great blessing to a man; to have his table surrounded with children, as olive plants; to be encircled with a large family was a crown of glory (e); and to live to see children's children, a large number of grandchildren, was still a greater glory; and especially, as Jarchi observes, when these children, or children's children, were walking in a good way, in the good ways of religion and godliness, they trained them up in. Christ is the Ancient of days, the everlasting Father; and it is his glory, as Mediator, to see his seed, to have a numerous off spring; and which will endure for ever, as the days of heaven: ministers of the Gospel are spiritual fathers; and those who have been converted under their ministry wilt be their joy and "crown of rejoicing" at the last day, <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-19.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:19</a>; <p>and the glory of children are their fathers; who are wise, as Aben Ezra observes; and righteous, as Jarchi: if they are wise and good men, it is an honour to their children that they descend from them; nor are they ashamed to own their relation to them, but glory in it, as the Jews did in Abraham, saying, "We have Abraham for our father", <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/3-9.htm">Matthew 3:9</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/3-8.htm">Luke 3:8</a>, but, on the contrary, if their fathers are foolish or wicked, their children are ashamed of them, and do not care to acknowledge their descent from them; and such parents, who are an honour to their children, their children should be careful to tread in their steps, that they reflect no dishonour on them; particularly as it is our great honour and glory to have God for our father, to be his adopted sons and daughters, we should be followers of him as dear children, and be obedient ones. <p>(d) In Lex.

Hereditary nobility, based on descent from some eminent progenitor, may be a source of not unseemly pride, and a spur to a life worthy of such excellent ancestry. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/16.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>33 One casts the lot into the lap;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But all its decision cometh from Jahve.<p>The Tra knows only in one instance an ordeal (a judgment of God) as a right means of proof, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/5-12.htm">Numbers 5:12-31</a>. The lot is nowhere ordained by it, but its use is supported by a custom running parallel with the Mosaic law; it was used not only in private life, but also in manifold ways within the domain of public justice, as well as for the detection of the guilty, <a href="/joshua/7-14.htm">Joshua 7:14</a>., <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-40.htm">1 Samuel 14:40-42</a>. So that the proverb P<a href="/romans/18-18.htm">Romans 18:18</a> says the same thing of the lot that is said in the Epistle to the Heb; <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/6-16.htm">Hebrews 6:16</a>, of the oath. The above proverb also explains the lot for an ordeal, for it is God who directs and orders it that it fall out thus and not otherwise. A particular sanction of the use of the lot does not lie in this, but it is only said, that where the lot is cast, all the decision that results from it is determined by God. That is in all cases true; but whether the challenging of the divine decision in such a way be right in this or that case is a question, and in no case would one, on the contrary, venture to make the person of the transgressor discoverable by lot, and let it decide regarding human life. But antiquity judged this matter differently, as e.g., the Book of Jonah (chap. 1) shows; it was a practice, animated by faith, in God's government of the world, which, if it did not observe the boundary between faith and superstition, yet stood high above the unbelief of the "Enlightenment." Like the Greek &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, &#1495;&#1497;&#1511; (from &#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511;, Arab. h&#803;ak&#803;, khak&#803;, to encompass, to stretch out) means, as it is commonly taken, gremium as well as sinus, but the latter meaning is the more sure; and thus also here it is not the lap as the middle of the body, so that one ought to think on him who casts the lot as seated, but also not the lap of the garment, but, like <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/6-27.htm">Proverbs 6:27</a>, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/40-11.htm">Isaiah 40:11</a>, the swelling, loose, external part of the clothing covering the bosom (the breast), where the lot covered by it is thrown by means of shaking and changing, and whence it is drawn out. The construction of the passive &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1496;&#1500; (from &#1496;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;  equals  Arab. tall, to throw along) with the object. accus. follows the old scheme, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/4-18.htm">Genesis 4:18</a>, and has its reason in this, that the Semitic passive, formed by the change of vowels, has not wholly given up the governing force of the active. &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496; signifies here decision as by the Urim and Thummim, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/27-21.htm">Numbers 27:21</a>, but which was no lot-apparatus. </body></html>
