If we would keep a clear conscience and a quiet mind, we must shun all excitements to anger. And a man who affects a style of living above his means, goes the way to ruin. 20. There is nothing got by ill designs. And many have paid dear for an unbridled tongue. 21. This speaks very plainly what many wise and good men feel very strongly, how grievous it is to have a foolish, wicked child. 22. It is great mercy that God gives us leave to be cheerful, and cause to be cheerful, if by his grace he gives us hearts to be cheerful. 23. The wicked are ready to part with their money, though loved, that they may not suffer for their crimes. 24. The prudent man keeps the word of God continually in view. But the foolish man cannot fix his thoughts, nor pursue any purpose with steadiness. 25. Wicked children despise the authority of their father, and the tenderness of their mother. 26. It is very wrong to find fault for doing what is duty. 27,28. A man may show himself to be a wise man, by the good temper of his mind, and by the good government of his tongue. He is careful when he does speak, to speak to the purpose.

Or, "he that knows knowledge" (c); one that is very knowing, has a fund of knowledge in him, "spareth his words"; is generally a man of few words, he thinks much and says little; and though he may be communicative of his knowledge to proper persons, and at proper times, yet never speaks of it in a boasting and ostentatious way: or, he "restrains his words" (d); he puts a bridle on them; and suffers not himself to speak hastily and angrily, and in a reproachful manner, when he is provoked to it; <p>and a man of understanding is of an excellent spirit; here is a various reading; the "Cetib" is  "of a cool spirit" (e); in opposition to a warm fiery spirit; such as was that of the apostles, who were for calling for fire from heaven on those that slighted their master, and, as he told them, knew not what spirits they were of; but a cool spirit is one that is not soon angry, calm, sedate, and not easily provoked to wrath: the "Keri", or marginal reading, is  "of an excellent" or "precious spirit" (f); and such an one is a right spirit; a spirit of faith and love, and of a sound mind; and of such a spirit is a man of understanding in things divine and spiritual; to have a spirit of prayer, and to be tenderhearted, and of a sympathizing and forgiving spirit, is to be of an excellent spirit. The Targum is, <p>"humble in spirit;'' <p>and a meek and quiet spirit is in the sight of God of great price; the Lord has a great regard to such who are of an humble and contrite spirit: with these he dwells, to these he gives more grace; these are like to Christ, and have the fruits of his Spirit, and are very useful and ornamental. The Septuagint, Syriac, and Arabic versions render it, "patient" or "longsuffering"; and to be of a patient spirit is to be of an excellent spirit: such bear afflictions and reproaches quietly; wait God's own time for hearing and helping them, and live in the comfortable expectation of heaven and happiness; and such show themselves to be wise and understanding men. <p>(c)  "qui scit scientiam", Pagninus, Vatablus, Mercerus.

We recognise it as striking the same keynote as <a href="/proverbs/10-1.htm">Proverbs 10:1</a>. In <a href="/proverbs/17-21.htm">Proverbs 17:21</a> it resounds once more, here commencing a part; there, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/10-1.htm">Proverbs 10:1</a>, beginning the second group of proverbs. The first closes, as it begins, with a proverb of the fool.<p>21 He that begetteth a fool, it is to his sorrow;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the father of a fool hath no joy.<p>It is admissible to supply &#1497;&#1500;&#1491;&#1493;, developing itself from &#1497;&#1500;&#1491;, before &#1500;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468;&#1490;&#1492; &#1500;&#1493; (vid., regarding this passive formation, at <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/10-1.htm">Proverbs 10:1</a>, cf. <a href="/proverbs/14-13.htm">Proverbs 14:13</a>), as at <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/66-3.htm">Isaiah 66:3</a>, &#1502;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492; (Fl.: in maerorem sibi genuit h. e. ideo videtur genuisse ut sibi maerorem crearet); but not less admissible is it to interpret &#1500;&#1514;&#1493;&#1490;&#1492; &#1500;&#1493; as a noun-clause corresponding to the &#1493;&#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1495; (thus to be written with Makkeph): it brings grief to him. According as one understands this as an expectation, or as a consequence, &#1497;&#1500;&#1491;, as at <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/23-24.htm">Proverbs 23:24</a>, is rendered either qui gignit or qui genuit.

Schultens rightly defines the latter etymologically: marcidus h. e. qui ad virtutem, pietatem, vigorem omnem vitae spiritualis medullitus emarcuit; and the former: elumbis et mollitie segnitieve fractus, the intellectually heavy and sluggish (cf. Arab. kasal, laziness; kasla&#770;n, the lazy).<p>(Note: Nldeke's assertion (Art. Orion in Schenkel's Bibel-Lexicon) that the Arab. kasal corresponds to the Hebr. &#1499;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500; proceeds from the twofold supposition, that the meaning to be lazy underlies the meaning to totter (vid., also Dietrich in Gesenius' Heb. Wrterbuch), and that the Hebr. &#1505; must correspond with the Arab. s&#780;. The former supposition is untenable, the latter is far removed (cf. e.g., &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1468;&#1488; and kurs&#305;&#770;, &#1505;&#1508;&#1512; and sifr, &#1502;&#1505;&#1499;&#1468;&#1503; and misk&#305;&#770;n). The verb &#1499;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;, Aram. &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1500;, is unknown in the Arab.) </body></html>
