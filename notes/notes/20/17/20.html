If we would keep a clear conscience and a quiet mind, we must shun all excitements to anger. And a man who affects a style of living above his means, goes the way to ruin. 20. There is nothing got by ill designs. And many have paid dear for an unbridled tongue. 21. This speaks very plainly what many wise and good men feel very strongly, how grievous it is to have a foolish, wicked child. 22. It is great mercy that God gives us leave to be cheerful, and cause to be cheerful, if by his grace he gives us hearts to be cheerful. 23. The wicked are ready to part with their money, though loved, that they may not suffer for their crimes. 24. The prudent man keeps the word of God continually in view. But the foolish man cannot fix his thoughts, nor pursue any purpose with steadiness. 25. Wicked children despise the authority of their father, and the tenderness of their mother. 26. It is very wrong to find fault for doing what is duty. 27,28. A man may show himself to be a wise man, by the good temper of his mind, and by the good government of his tongue. He is careful when he does speak, to speak to the purpose. God knows his heart, and the folly that is bound there; therefore he cannot be deceived in his judgment as men may be.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He that exalteth his gate - i. e., Builds a stately house, indulges in arrogant ostentation. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/17.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20.

The lxx, since it translates by &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;, thinks on the juristic signification, which occurs in the Chronicles: to make free, or to declare so; but here &#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1496;&#1512; &#1502;&#1497;&#1501; (vid., regarding the Metheg at <a href="/proverbs/14-31.htm">Proverbs 14:31</a>) is, as Luther translates, one who tears away the dam from the waters. And &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514; &#1502;&#1491;&#1493;&#1503; is not accus. dependent on &#1508;&#1493;&#1496;&#1512;, to be supplied (Hitzig: he unfetters water who the beginning of strife, viz., unfetters); but the part. is used as at <a href="/proverbs/10-17.htm">Proverbs 10:17</a> : one who unfetters the water is the beginning of strife, i.e., he is thus related to it as when one... This is an addition to the free use of the part. in the language of the Mishna, where one would expect the infin., e.g., &#1489;&#1468;&#1494;&#1493;&#1512;&#1506; ( equals  &#1489;&#1468;&#1494;&#1512;&#1506;), if one sows, &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1494;&#1497;&#1491; ( equals  &#1489;&#1468;&#1494;&#1491;&#1493;&#1503;), of wantonness. It is thus unnecessary, with Ewald, to interpret &#1508;&#1493;&#1496;&#1512; as neut., which lets water go  equals  a water-outbreak; &#1508;&#1493;&#1496;&#1512; is meant personally; it represents one who breaks through a water-dam, withdraws the restraint of the water, opens a sluice, and then emblematically the proverb says: thus conditioned is the beginning of a strife. Then follows the warning to let go such strife (&#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1489;, with the article used in the more elevated style, not without emphasis), to break from it, to separate it from oneself ere it reach a dangerous height. This is expressed by &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497; &#1492;&#1514;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1506;, a verb occurring only here and at <a href="/proverbs/18-1.htm">Proverbs 18:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/20-3.htm">Proverbs 20:3</a>, always in the Hithpa. The Targum (misunderstood by Gesenius after Buxtorf; vid., to the contrary, Levy, under the word &#1510;&#1491;&#1497; II) translates it at <a href="/proverbs/18-1.htm">Proverbs 18:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/20-3.htm">Proverbs 20:3</a>, as the Syr., by "to mock," also Aquila, who has at <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/20-3.htm">Proverbs 20:3</a>, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3c5;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, and the lxx at <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/18-1.htm">Proverbs 18:1</a>, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, and Jerome, who has this in all the three passages, render the Hithpa. in this sense, passively. In this passage before us, the Targ., as Hitzig gives it, translates, "before it heats itself," but that is an error occasioned by Buxtorf; vid., on the contrary, Levy, under the word &#1511;&#1512;&#1497;&#1488; (&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;); this translation, however, has a representative in Haja Gaon, who appeals for &#1490;&#1500;&#1506;, to glow, to Nidda viii. 2.<p>(Note: Vid., Simon Nascher's Der Gaon Haja u. seine giest. Thtig. p. 15.)<p>Elsewhere the lxx, at <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/20-3.htm">Proverbs 20:3</a>, &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; (where Jerome, with the amalgamation of the two significations, miscentur contumeliis); Kimchi and others gloss it by &#1492;&#1514;&#1506;&#1512;&#1489;, and, according to this, the Venet. translates, &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; (&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;); Luther, "before thou art mingled therein." But all these explanations of the word: insultare, excandescere, and commisceri, are etymologically inadmissible. Bertheau's and Zckler's "roll itself forth" is connected at least with a meaning rightly belonging to the R. &#1490;&#1500;. But the Arab. shows, that not the meaning volvere, but that of retegere is to be adopted. Aruch<p>(Note: Vid., p. 109, note.)<p>for Nidda viii. 2 refers to the Arab., where a wound is designated as &#1497;&#1499;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492; &#1500;&#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1506; &#1493;&#1500;&#1492;&#1493;&#1510;&#1497;&#1488; &#1491;&#1501;, i.e., as breaking up, as it were, when the crust of that which is nearly healed is broken off (Maimuni glosses the word by &#1500;&#1492;&#1514;&#1511;&#1500;&#1507;, were uncrusted), and blood again comes forth. The meaning retegere requires here, however, another distinction. The explanation mentioned there by Aruch: before the strife becomes public to thee, i.e., approaches thee, is not sufficient. The verbal stem &#1490;&#1500;&#1506; is the stronger power of &#1490;&#1500;&#1492;, and means laying bare; but here, not as there, in the Mishna of a wound covered with a crust. The Arab. jal' means to quarrel with another, properly to show him the teeth, the Pol or the tendency-stem from jali'a, to have the mouth standing open, so that one shows his teeth; and the Syr. glas&#803;, with its offshoots and derivatives, has also this meaning of ringi, opening the mouth to show, i.e., to make bare the teeth. Schultens has established this explanation of the words, and Gesenius further establishes it in the Thesaurus, according to which Fleischer also remarks, "&#1490;&#1500;&#1506;, of showing the teeth, the exposing of the teeth by the wide opening of the mouth, as happens in bitter quarrels." But &#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1489; does not agree with this. Hitzig's translation, "before the strife shows its teeth," is as modern as in <a href="/proverbs/17-11.htm">Proverbs 17:11</a> is the passion of the unfettered demon, and Fleischer's prius vero quam exacerbetur rixa renders the Hithpa. in a sense unnecessarily generalized for <a href="/proverbs/18-1.htm">Proverbs 18:1</a> and <a href="/proverbs/20-3.htm">Proverbs 20:3</a>. The accentuation, which separates &#1500;&#1492;&#1514;&#1490;&#1500;&#1506; from &#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1489; by Rebia Mugrash, is correct. One may translate, as Schultens, antequam dentes stringantur, or, since the Hithpa. has sometimes a reciprocal signification, e.g., <a href="/genesis/42-1.htm">Genesis 42:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/41-8.htm">Psalm 41:8</a> : ere one reciprocally shows his teeth, Hitzig unjustly takes exception to the inversion &#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1489; &#1504;&#1496;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;. Why should not the object precede, as at <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/12-1.htm">Hosea 12:1-14</a> :15, the &#1504;&#1496;&#1493;&#1513;, placed with emphasis at the end? The same inversion for a like reason occurs at <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:6</a>. </body></html>
