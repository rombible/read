If we would keep a clear conscience and a quiet mind, we must shun all excitements to anger. And a man who affects a style of living above his means, goes the way to ruin. 20. There is nothing got by ill designs. And many have paid dear for an unbridled tongue. 21. This speaks very plainly what many wise and good men feel very strongly, how grievous it is to have a foolish, wicked child. 22. It is great mercy that God gives us leave to be cheerful, and cause to be cheerful, if by his grace he gives us hearts to be cheerful. 23. The wicked are ready to part with their money, though loved, that they may not suffer for their crimes. 24. The prudent man keeps the word of God continually in view. But the foolish man cannot fix his thoughts, nor pursue any purpose with steadiness. 25. Wicked children despise the authority of their father, and the tenderness of their mother. 26. It is very wrong to find fault for doing what is duty. 27,28. A man may show himself to be a wise man, by the good temper of his mind, and by the good government of his tongue. He is careful when he does speak, to speak to the purpose. God knows his heart, and the folly that is bound there; therefore he cannot be deceived in his judgment as men may be.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Is esteemed - Or, "is" (simply).

Cato, 'Dist.,' 1:3 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Virtutem primam esse puta compescere linguam;<br />Proximus ille Deo qui scit ratione tacere."</span> Talmud, "Silence becomes the wise, much more feels." The Dutch have appropriated this maxim, "Zweigen de dwazen zij waren wijs, .... Were fools silent, they would pass for wise." "Si tacuisses, philosophus mansisses." "Silence," says the Sanskrit gnome, "is the ornament of the ignorant." "Talking comes by nature," say the Germans, "silence of understanding." The LXX. gives a different turn to the first clause: "A foolish man inquiring of wisdom will have wisdom imputed to him;" the expressed desire of knowledge will be taken as a proof of intelligence. The second clause is coordinate with the former. <span class="cmt_word">He that shutteth his lips is esteemed a man of understanding;</span> Revised Version, <span class="accented">when he shutteth his lips, he is esteemed as prudent</span>; Septuagint, "A man making himself dumb will seem to be prudent."

"Let every man," says St. James (<a href="/james/1-19.htm">James 1:19</a>), "be swift to hear, slow to speak." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/17.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>22 A joyful heart bringeth good recovery;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And a broken spirit drieth the bones.<p>The heart is the centre of the individual life, and the condition and the tone of the heart communicates itself to this life, even to its outermost circumference; the spirit is the power of self-consciousness which, according as it is lifted up or broken, also lifts up or breaks down the condition of the body (Psychol. p. 199), vid., the similar contrasted phrases &#1500;&#1489; &#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1495; and &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; &#1504;&#1499;&#1488;&#1492;, <a href="/proverbs/15-13.htm">Proverbs 15:13</a>. The &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. &#1490;&#1468;&#1492;&#1492; (here and there in Codd. incorrectly written &#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1492;&#1492;) has nothing to do with the Arab. jihat, which does not mean sight, but direction, and is formed from wjah (whence wajah, sight), like &#1506;&#1491;&#1492;, congregation, from &#1493;&#1506;&#1491; (&#1497;&#1506;&#1491;). The Syr., Targ. (perhaps also Symmachus: &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;; Jerome: aetatem floridam facit; Luther: makes the life lstig [cheerful]) translate it by body; but for this &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1492; (&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;) is used, and that is a word of an entirely different root from &#1490;&#1468;&#1492;&#1492;. To what verb this refers is shown by <a href="/hosea/5-13.htm">Hosea 5:13</a> : &#1493;&#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1497;&#1490;&#1492;&#1492; &#1502;&#1499;&#1468;&#1501; &#1502;&#1494;&#1493;&#1512;, and healed not for you her ulcerous wound. &#1502;&#1494;&#1493;&#1512; is the compress, i.e., the bandage closing up the ulcer, then also the ulcer-wound itself; and &#1490;&#1468;&#1492;&#1492; is the contrary of &#1506;&#1500;&#1492;, e.g., <a href="/jeremiah/8-22.htm">Jeremiah 8:22</a>; it means the removing of the bandage and the healing of the wound. This is confirmed by the Syr. gho, which in like manner is construed with min, and means to be delivered from something (vid., Bernstein's Lex. Syr. to Kirsch's Chrestomathie). The Aethiop. quadriliteral ga&#770;hge&#780;h, to hinder, to cause to cease, corresponds to the causative Syr. agahish. Accordingly &#1490;&#1468;&#1492;&#1492; means to be in the condition of abatement, mitigation, healing; and &#1490;&#1468;&#1492;&#1492; (as synonym of &#1499;&#1468;&#1492;&#1492;, <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-19.htm">Nehemiah 3:19</a>, with which Parchon combines it), levamen, levatio, in the sense of bodily healing (lxx &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;; Venet., after Kimchi, &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834; &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;); and &#1492;&#1497;&#1496;&#1497;&#1489; &#1490;&#1468;&#1492;&#1492; (cf. <a href="/proverbs/15-2.htm">Proverbs 15:2</a>) denotes, to bring good improvement, to advance powerfully the recovery. Schultens compares the Arab. jahy, nitescere, disserenari, as Menahem has done &#1504;&#1504;&#1492;&#1468;, but this word is one of the few words which are explained exclusively from the Syriac (and Aethiop.). &#1490;&#1468;&#1512;&#1501; (here and at <a href="/proverbs/25-15.htm">Proverbs 25:15</a>) is the word interchanging with &#1506;&#1510;&#1501;, <a href="/proverbs/15-30.htm">Proverbs 15:30</a>; <a href="/proverbs/16-24.htm">Proverbs 16:24</a>. </body></html>
