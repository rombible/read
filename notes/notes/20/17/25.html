If we would keep a clear conscience and a quiet mind, we must shun all excitements to anger. And a man who affects a style of living above his means, goes the way to ruin. 20. There is nothing got by ill designs. And many have paid dear for an unbridled tongue. 21. This speaks very plainly what many wise and good men feel very strongly, how grievous it is to have a foolish, wicked child. 22. It is great mercy that God gives us leave to be cheerful, and cause to be cheerful, if by his grace he gives us hearts to be cheerful. 23. The wicked are ready to part with their money, though loved, that they may not suffer for their crimes. 24. The prudent man keeps the word of God continually in view. But the foolish man cannot fix his thoughts, nor pursue any purpose with steadiness. 25. Wicked children despise the authority of their father, and the tenderness of their mother. 26. It is very wrong to find fault for doing what is duty. 27,28. A man may show himself to be a wise man, by the good temper of his mind, and by the good government of his tongue. He is careful when he does speak, to speak to the purpose. God knows his heart, and the folly that is bound there; therefore he cannot be deceived in his judgment as men may be.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Compare <a href="/proverbs/17-21.htm">Proverbs 17:21</a>.

Bttcher finds the reason of the pairing of these two lines in the relationship between a mouth and a door (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/7-6.htm">Micah 7:6</a>, &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1495;&#1497; &#1508;&#1497;&#1498;). Hitzig goes further, and supposes that 19b figuratively expresses what boastfulness brings upon itself. Against Geier, Schultens, and others, who understand &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1495;&#1493; directly of the mouth, he rightly remarks that &#1492;&#1490;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500; &#1508;&#1492; is not heard of, and that &#1492;&#1490;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500; &#1508;&#1492; taht dn would be used instead. But the two lines harmonize, without this interchangeable reference of os and ostium. Zanksucht [quarrelsomeness] and Prunksucht [ostentation] are related as the symptoms of selfishness. But both bear their sentence in themselves. He who has pleasure in quarrelling has pleasure in evil, for he commits himself to the way of great sinning, and draws others along with him; and he who cannot have the door of his house high enough and splendid enough, prepares thereby for himself, against his will, the destruction of his house. An old Hebrew proverb says, &#1499;&#1500; &#1492;&#1506;&#1493;&#1505;&#1511; &#1489;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1503; &#1497;&#1514;&#1502;&#1505;&#1499;&#1503;, aedificandi nimis studiosus ad mendicitatem redigitur. Both parts of this verse refer to one and the same individual, for the insanum aedificandi studium goes only too often hand in hand with unjust and heartless litigation.</body></html>
