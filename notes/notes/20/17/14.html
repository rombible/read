The way to preserve peace is to make the best of every thing; not to notice what has been said or done against ourselves. 10. A gentle reproof will enter, not only into the head, but into the heart of a wise man. 11. Satan, and the messengers of Satan, shall be let loose upon an evil man. 12. Let us watch over our own passions, and avoid the company of furious men. 13. To render evil for good is devilish. He that does so, brings a curse upon his family. 14. What danger there is in the beginning of strife! Resist its earliest display; and leave it off, if it were possible, before you begin. 15. It is an offence to God to acquit the guilty, or to condemn those who are not guilty. 16. Man's neglect of God's favour and his own interest is very absurd. 17. No change of outward circumstances should abate our affection for our friends or relatives. But no friend, except Christ, deserves unlimited confidence. In Him this text did receive, and still receives its most glorious fulfilment. 18. Let not any wrong their families.

As when a man makes a little hole in the bank of a river, or cuts a small passage in it, to let the water into an adjoining field; by the force of the water, the passage is widened, and it flows in, in great abundance, to the overflow and prejudice of the field; nor is it easily stopped: so a single word, spoken in anger, with some warmth, or in a way of contradiction, has been the beginning and occasion of great strife and contention. The words in the Hebrew text lie thus; "he that letteth out water is the beginning of strife" (o); which some understand of letting out water into another man's field, which occasions contentions, quarrels, and lawsuits; but the former sense is best: the Targum is, <p>"he that sheddeth blood as water stirreth up strifes;'' <p>therefore leave off contention, before it be meddled with; cease from it as soon as begun; leave it off before it is well entered: or "before one mixes himself" (p) with it, or is implicated with it; got so far into it, that it will be difficult to get out of it: or "before thou strivest with any openly"; which sense the word has in the Arabic language, as Schultens (q) observes; that is, before you come to open words and blows, put an end to the contention; do not suffer it to proceed so far; since it cannot be known what will be the consequence of it: or rather, leave it off, as the same learned writer in his later thoughts, in his commentary on the place, by the help of Arabism, also renders it, "before the teeth are made bare": or shown, in quarrelling, brawling, reproaching, in wrath and anger. <p>(o)    "qui aperit aquam, vel aperiens aquas (est) principium contentionis", Pagninus, Montanus.

Palestine was largely dependent upon its reservoirs for the storage of water, perennial springs being of rare occurrence. The three pools of Solomon in the neighbourhood of Bethlehem, which were connected by channels with Jerusalem, are still to be seen in all their massive grandeur; and, indeed, every town had its reservoir, or tank, as we find in India at the present time. These receptacles had to be kept in good repair, or disastrous consequences might ensue. On the tendency of a quarrel to grow to a dangerous extent, a Bengal proverb speaks of "going in a needle and coming out a ploughshare." Vulgate, <span class="accented">Qui dimittit aquam, caput est jurgiorum</span>, which seems to mean that the man who needlessly lets the water of a cistern run to waste gives occasion to quarrels. But St. Gregory ('Moral.,' 5:13), commenting on the passage, interprets differently: "It is well said by Solomon, 'He that letteth out water is a head of strife.' For the water is let out when the flowing of the tongue is let loose. And he that letteth out water is made the beginning of strife, in that, by the incontinency of the lips, the commencement of discord is afforded" (Oxford transl.). Probably, however, in the Latin, as in the Hebrew, the particle of comparison is suppressed, so that the clause means, "As he who lets out water, so is he who gives occasion to strife." <span class="cmt_word">Therefore leave off contention, before it be meddled with</span>. The last word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5ba;&#x5b7;&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span> is of doubtful interpretation. It occurs in <a href="/proverbs/18-1.htm">Proverbs 18:1</a> and Proverbs 20:3, and is variously translated, "before it rushes forward," "before it grows warm," "before a man becomes wrathful." But Hitzig, Nowaek, and others take it to signify, "before men show their teeth," like angry dogs snarling at one another. The moralist advises men to subdue angry passions at once before they become exacerbated. The Vulgate seems to have quite mistaken the clause, translating, <span class="accented">Antequam patiatur contumeliam, judicium deserit</span>, which seems to mean that a patient, peace-loving man (in contrast with the irascible) avoids lawsuits before he is involved in a lasting quarrel. Septuagint, "The beginning (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;</span>) of justice gives power to words; but discord and contention lead the way to want." The Greek commentators see here an allusion to the clepsydra, the water clock which regulated the length of the speeches in a court of law; but the reference is by no means clear. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/17.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>8 The gift of bribery appears a jewel to its receiver;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Whitherso'er he turneth himself he acteth prudently.<p>How 8b is to be understood is shown by <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-47.htm">1 Samuel 14:47</a>, cf. <a href="/joshua/1-7.htm">Joshua 1:7</a>; the quoque se vertit, prudenter rem agit, has accordingly in both sentences the person meant by &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; as subject, not the gift (Hitzig), of which &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;, "it maketh prosperous," is not said, for &#1492;&#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500; means, used only of persons, prudent, and therefore successful, fortunate conduct. Such is said of him who has to give (Luther): he presses through with it whithersoever he turns. But the making of &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497; the subj. does not accord with this: this means gift to one who has to give, appears to open doors and hearts, not merely as a golden key, it is truly such to him. Thus &#1489;&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;, as at <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/3-27.htm">Proverbs 3:27</a>, will be meant of him to whom the present is brought, or to whom a claim thereto is given. But &#1513;&#1474;&#1495;&#1491; means here not the gift of seasonable liberality (Zckler), but, as always, the gift of bribery, i.e., a gift by which one seeks to purchase for himself (<a href="/proverbs/17-23.htm">Proverbs 17:23</a>) preference on the part of a judge, or to mitigate the displeasure of a high lord (<a href="/proverbs/21-14.htm">Proverbs 21:14</a>); here (for one does not let it depend merely on the faithfulness of another to his duty) it is that by which one seeks to secure an advantage to himself. The proverb expresses a fact of experience. The gift of bribery, to which, as to a well-known approved means, &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1495;&#1491;, refers, appears to him who receives and accepts it (Targ.) as a stone of pleasantness, a charming, precious stone, a jewel (Juwl from joie  equals  gaudium); it determines and impels him to apply all his understanding, in order that he may reach the goal for which it shall be his reward. What he at first regarded as difficult, yea, impossible, that he now prudently carries out, and brings to a successful conclusion, wherever he turns himself, overcoming the seemingly insurmountable hindrances; for the enticement of the gift lifts him, as with a charm, above himself, for covetousness is a characteristic feature of human nature - pecuniae obediunt omnia (<a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-19.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:19</a>, Vulg.).</body></html>
