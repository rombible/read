Not but that silver may be desired, sought after and received, consistent with the instructions of wisdom; though an anxious, immoderate, sinful pursuit after it, hinders the reception of them; and when they are in competition, the one is to be preferred to the other: the doctrines of the Gospel are of more worth, and more to be desired, than thousands of gold and silver; and therefore the meaning is, that the instruction of wisdom should be received rather than silver; it should have the preference; so Gersom interprets it, and with which agrees the following clause: <p>and knowledge rather than choice gold; that is, the knowledge of Christ, and the knowledge of God in Christ; the knowledge of the Gospel, and the truths of it; a spiritual and experimental knowledge of these things is of more value than the finest gold, than the gold of Ophir; see <a href="/psalms/19-10.htm">Psalm 19:10</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/8.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather than choice gold.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Receive my instruction, and not silver</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> acquire wisdom rather than silver, if ever the choice is yours. <span class="cmt_word">And knowledge rather than choice gold</span> (comp. ver. 19; <a href="/proverbs/3.htm">Proverbs 3</a>:140.

Thus <a href="/hosea/6-6.htm">Hosea 6:6</a>, "I desired mercy, and not sacrifice," the second matter mentioned being, not necessarily of no importance, but always in such cases of inferior importance to the other. We may quote Horace's complaint of the worldliness of his countrymen, a marked contrast to the inspired counsel of Proverbs ('Epist.,' 1:1, 52) - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Villus argentum est auro, virtutibus aurum.<br />O cives, cives! quaerenda pecunia primum est,<br />Virtus post nummos."</span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Now begins the discourse.

But if this preamble, which reminds us of Elihu, is not according to every one's taste, yet in respect of the circle of conception and thought, as well as of the varying development of certain fundamental thoughts, it is altogether after the manner of the poet. The terminology is one that is strange to us; the translation of it is therefore difficult; that which is given above strives at least not to be so bad as to bring discredit on the poet. The tautology and flatness of <a href="/proverbs/8-4.htm">Proverbs 8:4</a> disappears when one understands &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; and &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1488;&#1491;&#1501; like the Attic &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c2; and &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;; vid., under <a href="/isaiah/2-9.htm">Isaiah 2:9</a>; <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a> (where &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;, as here and <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/141-4.htm">Psalm 141:4</a>, is equivalent to &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, <a href="/psalms/49-3.htm">Psalm 49:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/4-3.htm">Psalm 4:3</a>). Wisdom turns herself with her discourses to high and low, to persons of standing and to the proletariat. The verbal clause 4a interchanges with a noun clause 4b, as frequently a preposition with its noun (e.g., <a href="/proverbs/8-8.htm">Proverbs 8:8</a>) completes the whole predicate of a semistich (Fl.).</body></html>
