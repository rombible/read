The waste of waters which covered the face of the earth is meant - that great deep on which primeval darkness brooded (<a href="/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a>).

Regarding &#1492;&#1493;&#1503;, vid., <a href="/proverbs/1-13.htm">Proverbs 1:13</a>; instead of the adjective &#1497;&#1511;&#1512; there, we have here &#1506;&#1514;&#1511;. The verb &#1506;&#1514;&#1511; brev signifies promoveri, to move forwards, whence are derived the meanings old (cf. aetas provecta, advanced age), venerable for age, and noble, free (cf. &#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1511;, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/28-9.htm">Isaiah 28:9</a>, and Arab.

Used of clothing, &#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1511; (<a href="/isaiah/23-18.htm">Isaiah 23:18</a>) expresses the idea of venerable for age. &#1506;&#1514;&#1511; used of possessions and goods, like the Arab. 'a&#770;tak, denotes such goods as increase during long possession as an inheritance from father to son, and remain firm, and are not for the first time gained, but only need to be inherited, opes perennes et firmae (Schultens, Gesenius' Thesaur., Fleischer), although it may be also explained (which is, however, less probable with the form &#1506;&#1514;&#1511;) of the idea of the venerable from opes superbae (Jerome), splendid opulence. &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1492; is here also a good which is distributed, but properly the distributing goodness itself, as the Arab. s&#803;adak&#803;at, influenced by the later use of the Hebrew &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1492; (&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;  equals  &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;), denotes all that which God of His goodness causes to flow to men, or which men bestow upon men (Fl.). Righteousness is partly a recompensative goodness, which rewards, according to the law of requital, like with like; partly communicative, which, according to the law of love without merit, and even in opposition to it, bestows all that is good, and above all, itself; but giving itself to man, it assimilates him to itself (vid., <a href="/psalms/24-7.htm">Psalm 24:7</a>), so that he becomes &#1510;&#1491;&#1497;&#1511;, and is regarded as such before God and men, <a href="/proverbs/8-19.htm">Proverbs 8:19</a>.<p>The fruit and product of wisdom (the former a figure taken from the trees, <a href="/proverbs/3-18.htm">Proverbs 3:18</a>; the latter from the sowing of seed, <a href="/proverbs/3-9.htm">Proverbs 3:9</a>) is the gain and profit which it yields. With &#1495;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509;, <a href="/proverbs/8-10.htm">Proverbs 8:10</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/3-14.htm">Proverbs 3:14</a>, &#1508;&#1468;&#1494; is here named as the place of fine gold, briefly for &#1494;&#1492;&#1489; &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1494;, solid gold, gold separated from the place of ore which contains it, or generally separated gold, from &#1508;&#1468;&#1494;&#1494;, violently to separate metals from base mixtures; Targ. &#1491;&#1468;&#1492;&#1489;&#1488; &#1488;&#1493;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1494;&#1497;&#1503;, gold which has stood the fire-test, obrussa, of the crucible, Greek &#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, Pers. ebr&#305;&#770;z, Arab. ibr&#305;&#770;z. In the last clause of this verse, as also in 10b, &#1504;&#1489;&#1495;&#1512; is to be interpreted as pred. to &#1514;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514;&#1497;, but the balance of the meaning demands as a side-piece to the &#1502;&#1495;&#1512;&#1493;&#1509; &#1493;&#1502;&#1508;&#1494; (19a) something more than the mere &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1507;. In 20f. the reciprocal love is placed as the answer of love under the point of view of the requiting righteousness. But recompensative and communicative righteousness are here combined, where therefore the subject is the requital of worthy pure love and loving conduct, like with like. Such love requires reciprocal love, not merely cordial love, but that which expresses itself outwardly.</body></html>
