Such are the things of the Gospel; they not only excel what the light of nature dictates and directs to, but even what the law of Moses commands and requires; the doctrines of the Gospel are excellent in their author, nature, and use; particularly those which respect the love, grace, and mercy of God, the person and offices of Christ, the efficacy of his blood, righteousness, and sacrifice, and the great salvation which he has wrought out. These are the doctrines of grace which proceed out of Wisdom's mouth, and are such as never man spake the like; they are to be approved of, being what differ from others, and to be preferred unto them, <a href="/philippians/1-9.htm">Philippians 1:9</a>; or "princely things" (u), as the word may be rendered; which became him who is the Prince of the kings of the earth, and the Prince of peace to speak; and are worthy to be received by princes, though little known and valued by the princes of this world; and are embraced and, esteemed by those who are the princes of the Lord s people: or they are "principal" ones, or "leading" truths (w); of the greatest importance, interesting ones; "praiseworthy", as Aben Ezra, or "honourable", as Gersom, and to be had in the highest esteem and veneration; <p>and the opening of my lips shall be right things: agreeable to right reason, though above it; consonant to the righteous law of God, and even to the perfection of God's righteousness, which is greatly glorified by the obedience, sufferings, and death of Christ, and redemption through him; and these are the excellent and principal doctrines of the Gospel, even justification by Christ's righteousness, atonement by his sacrifice, and redemption through his blood; all which are consistent with and greatly display the justice of God: nor are any of the doctrines of the Gospel licentious ones, but on the contrary teach men to live soberly and righteously; as well as they are plain and easy to such who are conversant with them, as is often expressed, and may be the sense of the word here used also. <p>(u) "principalia, i.e. digna principibus", Mercerus, Gejerus, Michaelis; "ducalia", Gussetius, p. 485.

Hitzig and others, following the Syriac, prefer the meaning, "plain, evident truths" (comp. ver. 9); but the former interpretation is most suitable. <span class="cmt_word">The opening of my lips shall be right things.</span> That which I announce when I open my mouth is just and right (<a href="/proverbs/23-16.htm">Proverbs 23:16</a>).

It is otherwise if &#1512;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; here meant magni (thus e.g., Ralbag, and recently Bertheau), and not multi; but &#1512;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; and &#1506;&#1510;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; stand elsewhere in connection with each other in the signification many and numerous, <a href="/psalms/35-18.htm">Psalm 35:18</a>; <a href="/joel/2-2.htm">Joel 2:2</a>; <a href="/micah/4-3.htm">Micah 4:3</a>. "Her slain" are those slain by her; the part. pass. is connected with the genitive of the actor, e.g., <a href="/proverbs/9-18.htm">Proverbs 9:18</a>; cf.

Rightly Hitzig has: her house forms a multiplicity of ways to hell, in so far as adultery leads by a diversity of ways to hell.

If one is once in her house, he may go in this or in that way, but surely his path is to destruction: it consists of many steps to hell, such as lead down (&#1491;&#1512;&#1498;, fem. <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/37-34.htm">Isaiah 37:34</a>, masc. <a href="/isaiah/30-21.htm">Isaiah 30:21</a>) to the extreme depths of death (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/job/9-9.htm">Job 9:9</a>, "chambers of the south"  equals  its remotest regions veiling themselves in the invisible); for &#1495;&#1491;&#1512; (Arab. khiddr) is the part of the tent or the house removed farthest back, and the most private (Fl.).
