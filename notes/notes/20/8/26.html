That is, the Lord, who possessed Wisdom, or Christ, and by whom he was set up; he as yet had not made the earth, when this was done; this shows that the earth had a beginning, contrary to those philosophers who asserted the eternity of it; that Christ was before that was, for it was made by him; and consequently he must be eternal, and was before any man was, since the earth was made before man; and that he was not of the earth, earthy, as was the first man; <p>nor the fields; the plain parts of the earth, in opposition to the mountains and hills before mentioned; the valleys and meadows that lay between them, full of grass, flowers, and fruits; pleasant to behold, and profitable to be enjoyed; so the word is also rendered <a href="/job/5-10.htm">Job 5:10</a>; and "valleys", by the Targum here: or the "out parts" (m); the extremities of the earth, the two poles of it; the uninhabitable parts of the earth, as distinct from the habitable part of it afterwards mentioned: or all with out it; the ambient and spacious ether; <p>nor the highest part of the dust of the world: meaning, not the mountains and hills, which are before mentioned, and are the highest part of the earth; but rather "the chief of the dust of the earth" (n), as the words may be rendered; these are the metals and minerals within it; the gold, silver, and precious stones, of which we read very early, <a href="/genesis/2-12.htm">Genesis 2:12</a>; or the "beginning", the first and chief, the "prima materia", even the dusts of the world, out of which man and all the creatures were made, <a href="/genesis/2-6.htm">Genesis 2:6</a>. Dr. Lister (o) was of opinion that sand was once the most exterior and general cover of the surface of the whole earth; partly because all our northern mountains are covered with it, more or less, at this day; and partly because of its great hardness, durableness, and unalterable quality; and the higher the mountains be, he says, still the more and coarser the sand is; and if so, this might with propriety be called the highest part of the dust of the earth. But Christ was before any of them, as well as is more excellent than they. Or it may be man is designed, who was made of the dust of the earth; even the first man Adam, so Jarchi, <a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>; before whom Christ was: yea, the human nature of Christ himself may be meant, which is fairer than any of the children of men, and the chief of all the individuals of human nature; being without sin, and united to the Son of God, and also the curious workmanship of the Spirit of God. Now Christ, as the Son of God, as the only begotten of the Father, existed before his human nature did, or before he was the Son of man. <p>(m) "quae extra sunt", Tigurine version, Vatablus; "exteriora", Cocceius, Michaelis.

It is questioned <span class="accented">where</span> the mountains were supposed to be fixed, and some have thought that they are represented as fixed in the depths of the earth. But, as we learn from <a href="/genesis/1-9.htm">Genesis 1:9</a>, they are regarded as rising from the waters, their foundations are laid in the great deep. So the psalmist, speaking of the waters, says, "They went up by the mountains, they went down by the valleys, unto the place which thou hast founded for them" (<a href="/psalms/104-8.htm">Psalm 104:8</a>; comp. <a href="/psalms/24-2.htm">Psalm 24:2</a>). What is here affirmed of Wisdom is said of Jehovah in <a href="/psalms/90-2.htm">Psalm 90:2</a>, "Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting thou art God." <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The earth, nor the fields</span>. The distinction intended is land as cultivated and occupied by buildings, etc., and waste uncultivated land outside towns. Septuagint, "The Lord made countries and uninhabited places (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>);" Vulgate, <span class="accented">Adhuc terram non fecerat, et flumina.</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">chutsoth</span>; things without, abroad, hence open country. The Vulgate rendering, and that of Aquila and Symmaehus, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, are plainly erroneous, as waters have already been mentioned (ver. 24). <span class="cmt_word">The highest part of the dust of the world;</span> literally, <span class="accented">the head of the dusts of the world.</span> Some have interpreted this expression of "man," the chief of those creatures which are made of the dust of the ground (<a href="/genesis/3-19.htm">Genesis 3:19</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-20.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:20</a>). But the idea comes in awkwardly here; it is not natural to introduce man amid the inanimate works of nature, or to use such an enigmatical designation for him. St. Jerome has, <span class="accented">cardines orbis terrarum</span>, "the world's hinges;" Septuagint, "the inhabited summits of the earth beneath the heavens; according to St. Hilary ('De Trinit.,' 12), "cacumina quae habitantur sub coelo." Others take the term to signify the capes or promontories ot the world, the peaks and elevations; others, the clods of dry, amble land, in contrast to the untilled waste of waters; others, the chief elements, the matter of which the earth is composed. This last interpretation would lead us back to a period which has already been passed. Amid the many possible explanations, it is perhaps best (with Delitzsch, Nowack, etc.) to take <span class="accented">rosh</span>, "head" as equivalent to "sum," "mass," as in <a href="/psalms/139-17.htm">Psalm 139:17</a>. "How great is the sum (<span class="accented">rosh</span>) of them!" Then the expression comprehensively means all the mass of earth's dust. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In this sense, Wisdom says that she acts strictly according to justice and rectitude, and adds (21) wherein this her conduct manifests itself. The Piel &#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1498; expresses firm, constant action; and &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;&#1498; means that she turns from this line of conduct on no side. &#1500;&#1492;&#1504;&#1495;&#1497;&#1500; is distinguished from &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1504;&#1495;&#1497;&#1500;, as ut possidendam tribuam from possidendam tribuendo; the former denotes the direction of the activity, the latter its nature and manner; both combine if we translate ita ut....<p>(Note: Biesenthal combines the etymologically obscure &#1492;&#1504;&#1495;&#1497;&#1500; with &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;: to make to flow into, so that &#1504;&#1495;&#1500; denotes inheritance in contradistinction to acquisition; while &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1492;, in contradistinction to &#1497;&#1512;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1492;, denotes the inheritance rather of many than of the individual.)<p>Regarding the origin of &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, vid., at <a href="/proverbs/2-7.htm">Proverbs 2:7</a>; it denotes the being founded, thus substantia, and appears here, like the word in mediaeval Latin and Romanic (Ital. sustanza, Span. substancia), and like &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; and &#x3c5;&#788;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; (&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;) in classic Greek, to denote possessions and goods. But since this use of the word does not elsewhere occur (therefore Hitzig explains &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;  equals  &#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1500;&#1497;, I have it  equals  presto est), and here, where Wisdom speaks, &#1497;&#1513;&#1473; connects itself in thought with &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, it will at least denote real possession (as we also are wont to call not every kind of property, but only landed property, real possession), such possession as has real worth, and that not according to commercial exchange and price, but according to sound judgment, which applies a higher than the common worldly standard of worth. The Pasek between &#1488;&#1492;&#1489;&#1497; and &#1497;&#1513;&#1473; is designed to separate the two Jods from each other, and has, as a consequence, for &#1500;&#1492;&#1504;&#1495;&#1497;&#1500; &#1488;&#1492;&#1489;&#1497; the accentuation with Tarcha and Mercha (vid., Accentssystem, vi. 4; cf. Torath Emeth, p. 17, 3). The carrying forward of the inf. with the finite, 21b, is as <a href="/proverbs/1-27.htm">Proverbs 1:27</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/2-2.htm">Proverbs 2:2</a>, and quite usual. </body></html>
