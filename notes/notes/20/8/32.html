Let us all be wise, and not refuse such mercy. Blessed are those who hear the Saviour's voice, and wait on him with daily reading, meditation, and prayer. The children of the world find time for vain amusements, without neglecting what they deem the one thing needful. Does it not show contempt of Wisdom's instructions, when people professing godliness, seek excuses for neglecting the means of grace? Christ is Wisdom, and he is Life to all believers; nor can we obtain God's favour, unless we find Christ, and are found in him. Those who offend Christ deceive themselves; sin is a wrong to the soul.

Children of his and his Father, with whom his delights were; predestinated to the adoption of children; children of the covenant and promise, given to him as such in the covenant; for whom he became man, suffered and died, to gather together regenerated ones, by which they appear to be the children of God: these Wisdom here addresses in the most affectionate manner; Christ, having finished the account and description of himself, reassumes his former exhortation, <a href="/proverbs/8-5.htm">Proverbs 8:5</a>; and enforces it by the several particulars in the above description. From the consideration of his wisdom, riches, eternity, nearness to God, and his delights with men, he exhorts them to "hearken" to him, to his voice in the Gospel, and to what he says there; such who see themselves lost and perishing, the hungry and thirsty, the naked and weary, the disconsolate and afflicted, the poor and indigent; and also to his voice in his precepts and commands, to embrace his doctrines, and submit to his ordinances; <p>for blessed are they that keep my ways; it is a happiness to be in the ways of Christ, to be kept in them, and to keep them; Christ has promised and does vouchsafe his presence in them; there is a pleasure enjoyed in observing them; and though not for keeping, yet in keeping Christ's commands, there is great reward, <a href="/psalms/19-11.htm">Psalm 19:11</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/8.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Now therefore hearken unto me, O ye children: for blessed are they that keep my ways.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/8.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="ital"><a href="/context/proverbs/8-32.htm" title="Now therefore listen to me, O you children: for blessed are they that keep my ways....">Proverbs 8:32-36</a></span>.

Synonymous with &#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, as contrast to &#1495;&#1493;&#1510;&#1493;&#1514;, is &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500;, which like &#1497;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500; (produce, wealth) comes from &#1497;&#1489;&#1500;, and thus denotes the earth as fruit-bearing (as &#1488;&#1491;&#1502;&#1492; properly denotes the humus as the covering of earth). Accordingly, with Ewald, we may understand by &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; &#1506;&#1508;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, "the heaps of the many clods of the fertile arable land lying as if scattered on the plains." Hitzig also translates: "the first clods of the earth." We do not deny that &#1506;&#1508;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; may mean clods of earth, i.e., pieces of earth gathered together, as <a href="//biblehub.com/job/28-6.htm">Job 28:6</a>, &#1506;&#1508;&#1512;&#1514; &#1494;&#1492;&#1489;, gold ore, i.e., pieces of earth or ore containing gold. But for clods of earth the Heb. language has the nouns &#1512;&#1490;&#1489; and &#1502;&#1490;&#1512;&#1508;&#1492;; and if we read together &#1506;&#1508;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, plur. of the collective &#1506;&#1508;&#1512; (dust as a mass), which comes as from a n. unitatis &#1506;&#1508;&#1512;&#1492;, and &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;, which, among its meanings in poetry as well as in prose, has also that of the sum, i.e., the chief amount or the total amount (cf. the Arab. ra&#770;s a&#770;lma&#770;l, the capital, &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;), then the two words in their mutual relation yield the sense of the sum of the several parts of the dust, as of the atoms of dust (Cocceius; Schultens, summam pluverum orbis habitabilis); and Fleischer rightly remarks that other interpretations, as ab initio pulveris orbis, praecipus quaeque orbis terrarum, caput orbis terrarum (i.e., according to Rashi, the first man; according to Umbreit, man generally), leave the choice of the plur. &#1506;&#1508;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; unintelligible. Before these creatures originated, Wisdom was, as she herself says, and emphatically repeats, already born; &#1495;&#1493;&#1500;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; is the passive of the Pilel &#1495;&#1493;&#1500;&#1500;, which means to whirl, to twist oneself, to bring forth with sorrow (Aquila, Theodotion, &#x3c9;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;; Graec. Venet. 24a, &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, 25b, &#x3c9;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;), then but poet. generally to beget, to bring forth (<a href="/proverbs/25-23.htm">Proverbs 25:23</a>; <a href="/proverbs/26-10.htm">Proverbs 26:10</a>). </body></html>
