But the translation also: I was woven  equals  wrought (Hitzig, Ewald, and previously one of the Greeks, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;), does not commend itself, for &#1512;&#1511;&#1468;&#1501; (<a href="/psalms/139-15.htm">Psalm 139:15</a>), used of the embryo, lies far from the metaphorical sense in which &#1504;&#1505;&#1498;  equals  Arab. nasaj, texere, would here be translated of the origin of a person, and even of such a spiritual being as Wisdom; &#1504;&#1505;&#1491;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, as the lxx reads (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#769; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;), is not once used of such.

Literally, but unintelligibly, the Gr. Venet. &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, according to which (cf. Sir. 1:10) Bttcher: I was poured forth  equals  formed, but himself acknowledging that this figure is not suitable to personification; nor is it at all likely that the author applied the word, used in this sense of idols, to the origin of Wisdom. The fact is, that &#1504;&#1505;&#1498;, used as seldom of the anointing or consecration of kings, as &#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498;, passes over, like &#1497;&#1510;&#1511; (&#1492;&#1510;&#1468;&#1497;&#1511;), &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511; (&#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511;, a pillar), and &#1497;&#1510;&#1490; (&#1492;&#1510;&#1468;&#1497;&#1490;), from the meaning of pouring out to that of placing and appointing; the mediating idea appears to be that of the pouring forth of the metal, since &#1504;&#1505;&#1497;&#1498;, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/11-8.htm">Daniel 11:8</a>, like &#1504;&#1505;&#1498;, signifies a molten image. The Jewish interpreters quite correctly remark, in comparing it with the princely name &#1504;&#1505;&#1497;&#1498; [cf. <a href="/psalms/83-12.htm">Psalm 83:12</a>] (although without etymological insight), that a placing in princely dignity is meant. Of the three synonyms of aeternitas a parte ante, &#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501; points backwards into the infinite distance, &#1502;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; into the beginning of the world, &#1502;&#1511;&#1468;&#1491;&#1502;&#1497;&#1470;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; not into the times which precede the origin of the earth, but into the oldest times of its gradual arising; this &#1511;&#1491;&#1502;&#1497; it is impossible to render, in conformity with the Hebr. use of language: it is an extensive plur. of time, Bttcher, 697. The &#1502;&#1503; repeated does not mean that the origin and greatness of Wisdom are contemporaneous with the foundation of the world; but that when the world was founded, she was already an actual existence. </body></html>
