If one is once in her house, he may go in this or in that way, but surely his path is to destruction: it consists of many steps to hell, such as lead down (&#1491;&#1512;&#1498;, fem. <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/37-34.htm">Isaiah 37:34</a>, masc. <a href="/isaiah/30-21.htm">Isaiah 30:21</a>) to the extreme depths of death (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/job/9-9.htm">Job 9:9</a>, "chambers of the south"  equals  its remotest regions veiling themselves in the invisible); for &#1495;&#1491;&#1512; (Arab. khiddr) is the part of the tent or the house removed farthest back, and the most private (Fl.).
