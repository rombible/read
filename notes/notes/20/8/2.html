Contrasted with sensual allurements are the advantages of divine wisdom, which publicly invites men, offers the best principles of life, and the most valuable benefits resulting from receiving her counsels. Her relation to the divine plans and acts is introduced, as in Pr 3:19, 20, though more fully, to commend her desirableness for men, and the whole is closed by an assurance that those finding her find God's favor, and those neglecting ruin themselves. Many regard the passage as a description of the Son of God by the title, Wisdom, which the older Jews used (and by which He is called in Lu 11:49), as Joh 1:1, &c., describes Him by that of Logos, the Word. But the passage may be taken as a personification of wisdom: for, (1) Though described as with God, wisdom is not asserted to be God. (2) The use of personal attributes is equally consistent with a personification, as with the description of a real person. (3) The personal pronouns used accord with the gender (feminine) of wisdom constantly, and are never changed to that of the person meant, as sometimes occurs in a corresponding use of spirit, which is neuter in Greek, but to which masculine pronouns are often applied (Joh 16:14), when the acts of the Holy Spirit are described. (4) Such a personification is agreeable to the style of this book (compare Pr 1:20; 3:16, 17; 4:8; 6:20-22; 9:1-4), whereas no prophetical or other allusions to the Saviour or the new dispensation are found among the quotations of this book in the New Testament, and unless this be such, none exist. (5) Nothing is lost as to the importance of this passage, which still remains a most ornate and also solemn and impressive teaching of inspiration on the value of wisdom.<p>1-4.

For the figure of the deadly arrow connects itself neither with that of the ox which goes to the slaughter-house, nor with that of the madman who is put in chains: the former is not killed by being shot; and with the latter, the object is to render him harmless, not to put him to death. The lxx therefore converts &#1488;&#1493;&#1497;&#1500; into &#1488;&#1497;&#1500;, a stag, and connects the shooting with an arrow with this: &#x3b7;&#787;&#768; &#x3c9;&#788;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b7;&#788;&#834;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;. But we need no encroachment on the text itself, only a correct placing of its members. The three thoughts, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/7-23.htm">Proverbs 7:23</a>, reach a right conclusion and issue, if with &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492;&#1512; &#1510;&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512; &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1495; (here Mercha-mahpach) a new departure is begun with a comparison: he follows her with eager desires, like as a bird hastens to the snare (vid., regarding &#1508;&#1495;, a snare, and &#1502;&#1493;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473;, a noose, under <a href="/isaiah/8-15.htm">Isaiah 8:15</a>). What then follows is a continuation of 22a. The subject is again the youth, whose way is compared to that of an ox going to the slaughter, of a culprit in chains, and of a fool; and he knows not (non novit, as <a href="/proverbs/4-19.htm">Proverbs 4:19</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/9-18.htm">Proverbs 9:18</a>, and according to the sense, non curat, <a href="/proverbs/3-6.htm">Proverbs 3:6</a>; <a href="/proverbs/5-6.htm">Proverbs 5:6</a>) that it is done at the risk of his life (&#1489;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493; as <a href="/1_kings/2-23.htm">1 Kings 2:23</a>; <a href="/numbers/17-3.htm">Numbers 17:3</a>), that his life is the price with which this kind of love is bought (&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;, neut., as not merely <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:1</a> and the like, but also e.g., <a href="/leviticus/10-3.htm">Leviticus 10:3</a>; <a href="/esther/9-1.htm">Esther 9:1</a>) - that does not concern him till (&#1506;&#1491;  equals  &#1506;&#1491; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; or &#1506;&#1491; &#1499;&#1497;) the arrow breaks or pierces through (&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1495; as <a href="/job/16-13.htm">Job 16:13</a>) his liver, i.e., till he receives the death-wound, from which, if not immediately, yet at length he certainly dies. Elsewhere the part of the body struck with a deadly wound is called the reins or loins (Job, etc.), or the gall-bladder (<a href="/job/20-25.htm">Job 20:25</a>); here the liver, which is called &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1491;, Arab. kebid, perhaps as the organ in which sorrowful and painful affections make themselves felt (cf. Aeschylus, Agam. 801: &#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; &#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c6; &#787; &#x3b7;&#788;&#834;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;), especially the latter, because the passion of sensual love, according to the idea of the ancients, reflected itself in the liver. He who is love-sick has jecur ulcerosum (Horace, Od. i. 25. 15); he is diseased in his liver (Psychol. p. 268). But the arrow is not here the arrow of love which makes love-sick, but the arrow of death, which slays him who is ensnared in sinful love. The befooled youth continues the disreputable relation into which he has entered till it terminates in adultery and in lingering disease upon his body, remorse in his soul, and dishonour to his name, speedily ending in inevitable ruin both spiritually and temporally. </body></html>
