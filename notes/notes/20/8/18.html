All prudence and skill are from the Lord. Through the redemption of Christ's precious blood, the riches of his grace abound in all wisdom and prudence. Man found out many inventions for ruin; God found one for our recovery. He hates pride and arrogance, evil ways and froward conversation; these render men unwilling to hear his humbling, awakening, holy instructions. True religion gives men the best counsel in all difficult cases, and helps to make their way plain. His wisdom makes all truly happy who receive it in the love of Christ Jesus. Seek him early, seek him earnestly, seek him before any thing else. Christ never said, Seek in vain. Those who love Christ, are such as have seen his loveliness, and have had his love shed abroad in their hearts; therefore they are happy. They shall be happy in this world, or in that which is beyond compare better. Wealth gotten by vanity will soon be diminished, but that which is well got, will wear well; and that which is well spent upon works of piety and charity, will be lasting. If they have not riches and honour in this world, they shall have that which is infinitely better. They shall be happy in the grace of God. Christ, by his Spirit, guides believers into all truth, and so leads them in the way of righteousness; and they walk after the Spirit. Also, they shall be happy in the glory of God hereafter. In Wisdom's promises, believers have goods laid up, not for days and years, but for eternity; her fruit therefore is better than gold.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Durable riches - i. e., Treasure piled up for many years; ancient wealth. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18. durable riches &#8230; righteousness&#8212;Such are the "riches," enduring sources of happiness in moral possessions (compare Pr 3:16).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/proverbs/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Which he mentions here, either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

By "riches" are meant not the riches of Christ's person, the perfections of his nature, his works, and his vast empire over all creatures, and the revenues arising from thence, which though durable, yet not communicable; not temporal riches, which, though with him, and at his dispose, yet these, at least a large share of them, and in common, is not given to his people, nor are they durable; but the riches of grace, redeeming, justifying, pardoning, and sanctifying grace, are intended, and the riches of glory in another world: and so "honour" designs not that which he has as a divine Person, or as Mediator, which is incommunicable; much less temporal honour, for though this is with him and from him, as appears <a href="/proverbs/8-15.htm">Proverbs 8:15</a>; yet it is not usually given to his followers, who are not the great and noble, but generally reckoned the offscouring of all things; nor is such honour durable; but the honour he gives his people lies in their being espoused to him, in being the sons of God through him, in being made by him kings and priests unto God, and in reigning with him here and for ever; <p>yea, durable riches and righteousness; which last some understand as another adjunct and epithet of riches, and represent them in opposition to mammon of unrighteousness, or to riches either ill-gotten or ill-managed; and expresses another property of Christ's riches of grace and glory, as being what are come by in a way of righteousness into his hands, and are distributed faithfully by him; though rather it respects a distinct thing which is with Christ, and in his hands to give, even his justifying righteousness, consisting of his active and passive obedience, which he has wrought out, is in him, and given by him to his people; and is what is called the righteousness of God and of faith; which secures from condemnation and entitles to eternal life; and is an everlasting one, as durable as his riches are, which are his fulness that ever continues with him: pardon is "simul" and "semel" (g), and for ever; sanctifying grace, as faith, hope, and love, always abide; and about the riches of glory there can be no doubt of the permanency of them; and the same may be said of honour both here and hereafter. <p>(g) "At once" and "once for all". <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/8.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Riches and honour <i>are</i> with me; <span class="cverse3">{h}</span> durable riches and righteousness.</span><p>(h) Signifying that he chiefly means the spiritual treasures and heavenly riches.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/8.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">18</span>. <span class="ital">durable</span>] Or, <span class="ital">ancient</span>, R.V. marg.

And (2) instead of “that which is not,” “the riches which certainly make themselves wings, like an eagle that flieth towards heaven” (<a href="/proverbs/23-5.htm" title="Will you set your eyes on that which is not? for riches certainly make themselves wings; they fly away as an eagle toward heaven.">Proverbs 23:5</a>), Wisdom bestows “the true riches” (<a href="/luke/16-11.htm" title="If therefore you have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches?">Luke 16:11</a>), the wealth which is “our own” (<span class="ital">ib. <a href="/proverbs/8-12.htm" title="I wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of witty inventions.">Proverbs 8:12</a></span>), inseparable from us and a partaker of our immortality.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Riches and honour are with me</span> (see <a href="/proverbs/3-16.htm">Proverbs 3:16</a>). Wisdom has these things in her possession to bestow on whom she will, as God gave them to Solomon in reward of his petition for wisdom (<a href="/1_kings/3-13.htm">1 Kings 3:13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Durable riches and righteousness.</span> Things often regarded as incompatible. <span class="accented">Durable</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5b5;&#x5e7;</span> (<span class="accented">athek</span>), occurs only here (but see <a href="/isaiah/23-18.htm">Isaiah 23:18</a>), and means "old," "venerable," "long accumulated;" hence firm and lasting. Righteousness is the last reward that Wisdom bestows, without which, indeed, all material blessings would be nothing worth. Wealth obtained in a right way, and rightly used, is durable and stable. This was especially true under a temporal dispensation. We Christians, however, look not for reward in uncertain riches, but in God's favour here and happiness in another world. The Septuagint, "Possession of many things, and righteousness." What is denoted by "righteousness" is further explained in the following verses, 19-21. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Ver. 12 follows <a href="/proverbs/8-11.htm">Proverbs 8:11</a>  equals  <a href="/proverbs/3-15.htm">Proverbs 3:15</a> as a justification of this estimating of wisdom above all else in worth.

Wisdom inhabits prudence, has settled down, as it were, and taken up her residence in it, is at home in its whole sphere, and rules it.
