All prudence and skill are from the Lord. Through the redemption of Christ's precious blood, the riches of his grace abound in all wisdom and prudence. Man found out many inventions for ruin; God found one for our recovery. He hates pride and arrogance, evil ways and froward conversation; these render men unwilling to hear his humbling, awakening, holy instructions. True religion gives men the best counsel in all difficult cases, and helps to make their way plain. His wisdom makes all truly happy who receive it in the love of Christ Jesus. Seek him early, seek him earnestly, seek him before any thing else. Christ never said, Seek in vain. Those who love Christ, are such as have seen his loveliness, and have had his love shed abroad in their hearts; therefore they are happy. They shall be happy in this world, or in that which is beyond compare better. Wealth gotten by vanity will soon be diminished, but that which is well got, will wear well; and that which is well spent upon works of piety and charity, will be lasting. If they have not riches and honour in this world, they shall have that which is infinitely better. They shall be happy in the grace of God. Christ, by his Spirit, guides believers into all truth, and so leads them in the way of righteousness; and they walk after the Spirit. Also, they shall be happy in the glory of God hereafter. In Wisdom's promises, believers have goods laid up, not for days and years, but for eternity; her fruit therefore is better than gold.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Not only the common life of common men, but the exercise of the highest sovereignty, must have this Wisdom as its ground.

Such who govern, not in a cruel and rigorous manner, but with clemency and gentleness; who, as they are "free" and noble themselves, their subjects are a free people, and enjoy their privileges and liberties fully and quietly. And "the judges of the earth" are such, as sit on benches of justice, hear and try causes, and pass sentence on men; which requires great skill and knowledge, and much faithfulness and integrity, which all that perform their office aright have from Christ.

Thus the Book of Wisdom, which speaks of the duties of rulers, commences by addressing of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;</span>, "ye that are judges of the earth." In the East judgment of causes was an integral part of a monarch's duties. The reading of the Authorized Version is supported by the Septuagint, which gives <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>.

Nowack compares <a href="/psalms/2-10.htm">Psalm 2:10</a> and Psalms 148:11, "Kings of the earth, and all people; princes, and all judges of the earth." The Fathers have taken these verses as spoken by God, and as asserting his supremacy and the providential ordering of human government, according to St. Paul's saying, "There is no power but of God; and the powers that be are ordained of God" (<a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a>; see St. Augustine, 'De Civit.

"Such negations and prohibitions," Fleischer remarks, "are to be understood comparatively: instead of acquiring silver, rather acquire wisdom. Similar is the old Arabic 'l-na&#770;r w-l'-'l-'a&#770;r, the fire, and not the disgrace! Also among the modern Arabic proverbs collected by Burckhardt, many have this form, e.g., No. 34, alh&#803;ajamat balafas wala alh&#803;ajat alanas, Better to let oneself be cut with the axe then to beg for the favour of another" 10b is to be translated, with Jerome, Kimchi, and others: and knowledge is more precious than fine gold (&#1504;&#1489;&#1495;&#1512;, neut.: auro pretiosius); and in view of <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/16-16.htm">Proverbs 16:16</a>, this construction appears to be intended. But Fleischer has quite correctly affirmed that this assertatory clause is unsuitably placed as a parallel clause over against the preceding imperative clause, and, what is yet more important, that then <a href="/proverbs/8-11.htm">Proverbs 8:11</a> would repeat idem per idem in a tautological manner. We therefore, after the Aramaic and Greek translators, take &#1499;&#1505;&#1507; &#1504;&#1489;&#1495;&#1512; together here as well as at <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/8-19.htm">Proverbs 8:19</a>, inasmuch as we carry forward the &#1511;&#1495;&#1493;: et scientiam prae auro lectissimo, which is also according to the accentuation. Equally pregnant is the &#1502;&#1503; in &#1502;&#1495;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509; of the passage <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/3-14.htm">Proverbs 3:14-15</a>, which is here varied.</body></html>
