This is Bishop Patrick’s opinion, who says, “I take wisdom here, as it signifies in other places of this book, and hath been hitherto described; which Solomon now celebrates for her most venerable antiquity, and introduces like a most beautiful person, no less than a queen, or rather some divine being, who, having finished her own praises, concludes with an earnest invitation unto all to become acquainted with her instructions, if they mean to be happy, and to avoid the greatest miseries.

Contrasted with sensual allurements are the advantages of divine wisdom, which publicly invites men, offers the best principles of life, and the most valuable benefits resulting from receiving her counsels. Her relation to the divine plans and acts is introduced, as in Pr 3:19, 20, though more fully, to commend her desirableness for men, and the whole is closed by an assurance that those finding her find God's favor, and those neglecting ruin themselves. Many regard the passage as a description of the Son of God by the title, Wisdom, which the older Jews used (and by which He is called in Lu 11:49), as Joh 1:1, &c., describes Him by that of Logos, the Word. But the passage may be taken as a personification of wisdom: for, (1) Though described as with God, wisdom is not asserted to be God. (2) The use of personal attributes is equally consistent with a personification, as with the description of a real person. (3) The personal pronouns used accord with the gender (feminine) of wisdom constantly, and are never changed to that of the person meant, as sometimes occurs in a corresponding use of spirit, which is neuter in Greek, but to which masculine pronouns are often applied (Joh 16:14), when the acts of the Holy Spirit are described. (4) Such a personification is agreeable to the style of this book (compare Pr 1:20; 3:16, 17; 4:8; 6:20-22; 9:1-4), whereas no prophetical or other allusions to the Saviour or the new dispensation are found among the quotations of this book in the New Testament, and unless this be such, none exist. (5) Nothing is lost as to the importance of this passage, which still remains a most ornate and also solemn and impressive teaching of inspiration on the value of wisdom.<p>1-4.

Christ, who is the Wisdom of God; See Gill on <a href="/proverbs/1-20.htm">Proverbs 1:20</a>; and which clearly appears from his subsistence with the Father, his eternal existence, and from many personal properties, characters, and actions ascribed to him throughout the whole of this chapter, and in the following. "Crying" is here attributed to him, which signifies proclaiming, publishing, preaching the everlasting Gospel, which directs men in the right way of enjoying peace, comfort, honour, and eternal happiness; the allusion is to an herald that this up his voice aloud at noon day in the public streets when he proclaims; and is opposed to the whispers of a harlot, at night, in a corner; truth seeks no corner, its voice is heard at noon day, it will bear the light. Now, "does not" or "shall not Wisdom cry", or Christ preach; verily he does or will, in his word, by his prophets under the former dispensation; in his own person, and by his apostles and ministers, under the present; who then would hearken to the alluring voice of a harlot, or hear Jezebel the wicked prophetess teach, when Christ himself preaches, or however by his faithful ministers? <p>and understanding put forth her voice? the same with Wisdom, or Christ, see <a href="/proverbs/8-14.htm">Proverbs 8:14</a>; by whose voice the Gospel is meant, which is the voice of Christ, which is heard and followed by the sheep of Christ, and not the voice of a stranger; and "putting it forth", giving or uttering it, signifies the publication of it. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/8.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Doth not <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice?</span><p>(a) Solomon declares that man is the cause of his own perdition and that he cannot pretend ignorance, for God calls all men by his word and his works to follow virtue and flee from vice.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/8.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><a href="/context/proverbs/8-1.htm" title="Does not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice?..."><span class="ital">Proverbs 8:1-3</a></span>. <span class="ital">The call of Wisdom</span>.

She is contrasted with the strange woman of ch. 7, and the exceeding greatness of the blessings which she offers exhibits in the most marked manner the nothingness of the deceiver's gifts. One is reminded of the celebrated episode of the choice of Hercules, delineated by Xenophon, 'Memorab.,' 2:1. 21, etc. The chapter divides itself into four sections. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Introductory (vers. 1-3); Wisdom calls on all to listen, and gives reasons for trusting to her (vers. 4-11). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> She displays her  excellence (vers. 12-21). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> She discourses of her origin and action (vers. 22-31). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> She again inculcates the duty of hearkening to her instructions (vers. 32-36). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Doth not Wisdom cry?</span> (see on Proverbs 1:20, and Introduction). The interrogative form, which expects an affirmative answer, is a mode of asserting a truth universally allowed. Wisdom is personified, though we are not so plainly confronted by an individual, as in the preceding case of the harlot. But it must be remembered that, whatever may have been the author's exact meaning, however worldly a view the original enunciation may have afforded, we, reading these chapters by the light cast upon them by later revelation, see m the description of Wisdom no mere ideal of practical prudence and good sense, no mere poetic personification of an abstract quality, but an adumbration of him who is the Wisdom of God, the coeternal Son of the Father. The open, bold, and public utterances of Wisdom are in happy contrast to the secret and stealthy enticements of Vice. So Christ, the true Wisdom, says, "I have spoken openly to the world; I ever taught in the synagogues, and in the temple, where all the Jews come together; and in secret spake I nothing" (<a href="/john/18-20.htm">John 18:20</a>). The Septuagint changes the subject of this verse, and makes the pupil addressed: "Thou shalt proclaim (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) wisdom, that understanding (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) may obey thee;" which seems to mean that, if you wish to acquire wisdom, so that it may serve you practically, you must act as a herald or preacher, and make your desire generally known. St. Gregory has some remarks about wilful ignorance of what is right. "It is one thing," he says, "to be ignorant; another to have refused to learn. For not to know is only ignorance; to refuse to learn is pride. And they are the less able to plead ignorance in excuse, the more that knowledge is set before them, even against their will. We might, perhaps, be able to pass along the way of this present life in ignorance of this Wisdom, if she herself had not steed in the corners of the way" ('Moral.,' 25:29). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>What followed: - <p>22 So he goes after her at once<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As an ox which goeth to the slaughter-house,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And as one bereft of reason to the restraint of fetters,<p>23 As a bird hastens to the net,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without knowing that his life is at stake - <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Till the arrow pierces his liver.<p>The part. &#1492;&#1493;&#1500;&#1498; (thus to be accentuated according to the rule in Baer's Torath Emeth, p. 25, with Mercha to the tone-syllable and Mahpach to the preceding open syllable) preserves the idea of the fool's going after her. &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1488;&#1501; (suddenly) fixes the point, when he all at once resolves to betake himself to the rendezvous in the house of the adulteress, now a &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c2;, as the lxx translates, i.e., as we say, a simpleton who has gone on the lime-twig. He follows her as an ox goes to the slaughter-house, unconscious that he is going thither to be slaughtered; the lxx ungrammatically destroying the attributive clause: &#x3c9;&#788;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;. The difficulties in &#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1506;&#1499;&#1505; (thus punctuated, after Kimchi, with a double Segol, and not &#1493;&#1499;&#1506;&#1499;&#1505;, as is frequently the case) multiply, and it is not to be reconciled with the traditional text. The ox appears to require another beast as a side-piece; and accordingly the lxx, Syr., and Targ. find in &#1506;&#1499;&#1505; a dog (to which from &#1488;&#1493;&#1497;&#1500; they also pick out &#1488;&#1497;&#1468;&#1500;, a stag), Jerome a lamb (et quasi agnus &#1499;&#1489;&#1513;&#1474;), Rashi a venomous serpent (perhaps after &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;?), Lwenstein and Malbim a rattlesnake (&#1504;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473; &#1502;&#1510;&#1500;&#1510;&#1500; after &#1506;&#1499;&#1468;&#1505;); but all this is mere conjecture. Symmachus' &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;) is without support, and, like the favourite rendering of Schelling, et sicut saliens in vinculum cervus (&#1488;&#1497;&#1500;), is unsuitable on account of the unsemitic position of the words. The noun &#1506;&#1499;&#1505;, plur. &#1506;&#1499;&#1505;&#1497;&#1501;, signifies, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/3-18.htm">Isaiah 3:18</a>, an anklet as a female ornament (whence <a href="/isaiah/3-16.htm">Isaiah 3:16</a> the denom. &#1506;&#1499;&#1468;&#1505;, to make a tinkling of the anklets). In itself the word only means the fetter, compes, from &#1506;&#1499;&#1505;, Arab. 'akas, 'akash, contrahere, constringere (vid., Fleischer under <a href="/isaiah/59-5.htm">Isaiah 59:5</a>); and that it can also be used of any kind of means of checking free movement, the Arab. 'ika&#770;s, as the name of a cord with which the camel is made fast by the head and forefeet, shows. With this signification the interpretation is: et velut pedic ( equals  &#1493;&#1499;&#1489;&#1506;&#1499;&#1505;) implicatus ad castigationem stulti, he follows her as if (bound) with a fetter to the punishment of the fool, i.e., of himself (Michaelis, Fleischer, and others). Otherwise Luther, who first translated "in a fetter," but afterwards (supplying &#1500;, not &#1489;): "and as if to fetters, where one corrects fools." But the ellipsis is harsh, and the parallelism leads us to expect a living being in the place of &#1506;&#1499;&#1505;. Now since, according to Gesenius, &#1506;&#1499;&#1505;, fetter, can be equivalent to a fettered one neither at <a href="/isaiah/17-5.htm">Isaiah 17:5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/21-17.htm">Isaiah 21:17</a>, nor <a href="/proverbs/23-28.htm">Proverbs 23:28</a> (according to which &#1506;&#1499;&#1505; must at least have an active personal signification), we transpose the nouns of the clause and write &#1493;&#1499;&#1488;&#1493;&#1497;&#1500; &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1512; &#1506;&#1499;&#1505;, he follows her as a fool (Psychol. p. 292) to correction (restraint) with fetters; or if &#1488;&#1493;&#1497;&#1500; is to be understood not so much physically as morally, and refers to self-destroying conduct (<a href="/psalms/107-7.htm">Psalm 107:7</a>): as a madman, i.e., a criminal, to chains. The one figure denotes the fate into which he rushes, like a beast devoid of reason, as the loss of life; and the other denotes the fate to which he permits himself to be led by that woman, like a criminal by the officer, as the loss of freedom and of honour.</body></html>
