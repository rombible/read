All prudence and skill are from the Lord. Through the redemption of Christ's precious blood, the riches of his grace abound in all wisdom and prudence. Man found out many inventions for ruin; God found one for our recovery. He hates pride and arrogance, evil ways and froward conversation; these render men unwilling to hear his humbling, awakening, holy instructions. True religion gives men the best counsel in all difficult cases, and helps to make their way plain. His wisdom makes all truly happy who receive it in the love of Christ Jesus. Seek him early, seek him earnestly, seek him before any thing else. Christ never said, Seek in vain. Those who love Christ, are such as have seen his loveliness, and have had his love shed abroad in their hearts; therefore they are happy. They shall be happy in this world, or in that which is beyond compare better. Wealth gotten by vanity will soon be diminished, but that which is well got, will wear well; and that which is well spent upon works of piety and charity, will be lasting. If they have not riches and honour in this world, they shall have that which is infinitely better. They shall be happy in the grace of God. Christ, by his Spirit, guides believers into all truth, and so leads them in the way of righteousness; and they walk after the Spirit. Also, they shall be happy in the glory of God hereafter. In Wisdom's promises, believers have goods laid up, not for days and years, but for eternity; her fruit therefore is better than gold.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Wisdom first speaks warnings (<a href="/proverbs/1-24.htm">Proverbs 1:24</a> note), next promises (<a href="/proverbs/2-1.htm">Proverbs 2:1</a> note); but here she neither promises nor threatens, but speaks of her own excellence. "Prudence" is the "subtilty" (see the margin), the wiliness of the serpent <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/3-1.htm">Genesis 3:1</a>, in itself neutral, but capable of being turned to good as well as evil. Wisdom, occupied with things heavenly and eternal, also "dwells with" the practical tact and insight needed for the life of common men. "Witty inventions" are rather counsels.

The words and sentiments in this and the following clause are the same with those in <a href="/job/12-13.htm">Job 12:13</a>; and scent to be taken from thence, which are spoken of God; and being here applied to Wisdom, show that a divine Person is meant; and are very applicable to him who the Wisdom of God, and the power of God; and on whom rests the Spirit of wisdom and understanding, of counsel, and of might, and of the fear of the Lord, <a href="/1_corinthians/1-24.htm">1 Corinthians 1:24</a>. "Counsel" belongs to him, and is used and exercised by him, as concerned with the Father and Spirit, both in the words of nature and grace; to whom all the purposes and counsels of God are known; and who was consulted in the creation of man, and in his redemption, reconciliation, and salvation; the council of peace being between them both: and it belongs to him, and is used by him with respect to his people; he is council to them; he gives them counsel and advice, he being the wonderful Counsellor; he gave it in person when here on earth, both to sinners and to saints, and which continues on record: the Gospel is the counsel of Christ, and it is very suitable and seasonable, hearty, sincere, and faithful; is freely given, and, being taken, infallibly succeeds; see <a href="/revelation/3-18.htm">Revelation 3:18</a>. And he is council for them; he appears for them in court; introduces their persons, and presents their petitions to his Father; pleads their cause, is their advocate, answers to all charges and accusations; and calls for and requires, in point of law and justice, every blessing of goodness for them. "Sound wisdom" belongs to Christ; "wisdom", from whence he has his name in this book; "sound" wisdom, such as is solid and substantial, real and true, in opposition to the wisdom of the world, to knowledge falsely so called, to carnal, sensual, and earthly wisdom. The Gospel may be meant, which is the wisdom of God in a mystery; sound doctrine, a form of sound words, the wholesome words of our Lord Jesus: both grace and glory may be intended, which are both in the gift of Christ; grace is that "wisdom" which he makes his people to "know in the hidden part"; and glory is that "sound wisdom" laid up for the righteous, the better and more enduring substance in heaven. The word here used signifies essence or substance; and some render it, "whatsoever is" (d); whatever has a being, that is Christ's; all creatures are his, the earth and the fulness of it, and they that dwell therein; <p>I am understanding; essentially as a divine person; his understanding is infinite; there is no searching of it; it reaches to all persons and things: as Mediator, the Spirit of wisdom and understanding rests on him without measure, by which he was furnished for his prophetic office; as man, his understanding was amazing to all that knew him, and heard him. Christ not only has an understanding, but he is understanding itself; he is the fountain, author, and giver of understanding; of all the natural understanding there is in men; of the light of nature and reason, of those intellectual faculties which men are possessed of; and of all the spiritual understanding in divine things, which his people are partakers of, <a href="/1_john/5-20.htm">1 John 5:20</a>; <p>I have strength; as the mighty God; which appears in his creation of all things out of nothing, in his upholding all things by his power, and in his government of the world. As Mediator, he has the Spirit of might upon him; all power in heaven and earth is given him; his strength is manifest in the salvation of his people, when he came travelling in the greatness of it to save them; by fulfilling the law for them; by bearing their sins, and the punishment due to them; and by destroying all their enemies: and in his plucking them out of the hands of Satan, out of the burning, out of the mire and clay at conversion; in bearing and supporting them under all their burdens, afflictions, and temptations, and in preserving them safe to his kingdom and glory; and in giving them strength in the mean time to bear the cross, to withstand temptations and corruptions, to exercise the graces of the spirit, and perform the duties of religion. <p>(d) "essentia", Montanus, Tigurine version; "quicquid est", Junius &amp; Tremellius; "realitas", Michaelis; "soliditas", Schultens. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/8.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom: I am understanding; I have strength.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/8.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">14</span>. <span class="ital">sound wisdom</span>] So the same word is rendered both by A.V. and R.V. in <a href="/proverbs/2-7.htm" title="He lays up sound wisdom for the righteous: he is a buckler to them that walk uprightly.">Proverbs 2:7</a>.

The Vulgate has <span class="accented">aequitas</span>; the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>, "safety." The word occurs elsewhere in this book and in Job, but only in two other places of Scripture, viz. <a href="/isaiah/28-29.htm">Isaiah 28:29</a> and <a href="/micah/6-9.htm">Micah 6:9</a>. It means properly "elevation" or "furtherance," or, as others say, "substance;" and then that which is essentially good end useful, which may be wisdom, aid, or security (see on Proverbs 2:7). Wisdom affirms that she possesses counsel and all that can help forward righteousness; see <a href="/job/12-13.htm">Job 12:13, 16</a>, passages very similar to the present (comp. Wisd. 8:9, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">I am understanding.</span> Wisdom does not merely possess these attributes; they are her very nature, as it is said, "God is love" St. Jerome's <span class="accented">mea est prudentia</span>, and the LXX.'s <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, lose this trait. <span class="cmt_word">I have strength.</span> Wisdom directs the energies and powers of her pupils, which without her control would be spent wrongly or uselessly (comp. <a href="/ecclesiastes/7-19.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:19</a>). Wisdom, understanding, and might are named among the seven gifts of the Spirit in <a href="/isaiah/11-2.htm">Isaiah 11:2</a>; and we may see in the passage generally an adumbration of him who is called "Wonderful, Counsellor, the Mighty God" (<a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The &#1489;&#1468; of &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1491;&#1511; is that of the close connection of a quality with an action or matter, which forms with a substantive adverbia as well as virtual adjectiva, as here: cum rectitudine (conjuncta i. e. vera) sunt omnia dicta oris mei (Fl.); it is the &#1489; of the distinctive attribute (Hitzig), certainly related to the &#1489; essentiae (<a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/3-26.htm">Proverbs 3:26</a>, according to which Schultens and Bertheau explain), which is connected with the abstract conception (e.g., <a href="/psalms/33-4.htm">Psalm 33:4</a>), but also admits the article designating the gender (vid., at <a href="/psalms/29-4.htm">Psalm 29:4</a>). The opposite of &#1510;&#1491;&#1511; (here in the sense of veracitas, which it means in Arab.) is &#1504;&#1508;&#1514;&#1468;&#1500; &#1493;&#1506;&#1511;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;, dolosum ac perversum. &#1506;&#1511;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; (cf. Gesen. 84, 9) is that which is violently bent and twisted, i.e., estranged from the truth, which is, so to speak, parodied or caricatured. Related to it in meaning, but proceeding from a somewhat different idea, is &#1504;&#1508;&#1514;&#1500;. &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1500;, used primarily of threads, cords, ropes, and the like, means to twist them, to twine them over and into one another, whence &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;&#1500;, a line or string made of several intertwisted threads (cf. Arab. ft&#305;&#770;lt, a wick of a candle or lamp); Niph., to be twisted, specifically luctari, of the twisting of the limbs, and figuratively to bend and twist oneself, like the crafty (versutus) liars and deceivers, of words and thoughts which do not directly go forth, but by the crafty twistings of truth and rectitude, opp. &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, &#1504;&#1499;&#1493;&#1503; (Fl.). There is nothing of deception of error in the utterances of wisdom; much rather they are all &#1504;&#1499;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501;, straight out from her (cf. <a href="/isaiah/57-2.htm">Isaiah 57:2</a>), going directly out, and without circumlocution directed to the right end for the intelligent, the knowing (cf. <a href="/nehemiah/10-29.htm">Nehemiah 10:29</a>); and &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, straight or even, giving no occasion to stumble, removing the danger of erring for those who have obtained knowledge, i.e., of good and evil, and thus the ability of distinguishing between them (Gesen. 134, 1) - briefly, for those who know how to estimate them. </body></html>
