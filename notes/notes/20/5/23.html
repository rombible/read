This "folly" may be understood either of his fornication and adultery, which is egregious folly; or of his imagining that he should be able to repent of sin when he pleased, and free himself from the bondage of it, and escape the punishment due unto it. <p>(z)  "eo quod non audivit eruditionem", Pagninus, Mercerus, Gejerus; "propter neglectam institutionem", Piscator; "propter non admissam disciplinam", Noldius, p. 181.

The obvious meaning is, because he gave no heed to instruction. So Aben Ezra and Gersom. The Authorized Version is at least ambiguous, and seems to imply that the adulterer has been without instruction, without any to reprove or counsel him. But such is not the case. He has been admonished of the evil consequences of his sin, but to these warnings he has turned a deaf ear, and the teacher says therefore he shall die. The Vulgate supports this explanation, <span class="accented">quia non habuit disciplinam</span> "because he did not entertain or use instruction." In the LXX. the idea is enlarged, "He shall die together with these who have no instruction (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>)." The <span class="accented">b</span>' (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;</span>) in <span class="accented">b'eyn</span> is causal, and equivalent to <span class="accented">propter</span>, as in <a href="/genesis/18-28.htm">Genesis 18:28</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/17-3.htm">Jeremiah 17:3</a>. A similar statement is found in <a href="/job/4-21.htm">Job 4:21</a>, "They die even without wisdom," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> because they have disregarded the lessons of wisdom; and <a href="/job/36-12.htm">Job 36:12</a>, "They shall die without knowledge." <span class="cmt_word">And in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray;</span> better, as Delitzsch, "He shall stagger to ruin." The verb <span class="accented">shagah</span> is used as in vers. 19 and 20, but with a deeper and more dread significance. A climax is reached in the manner in which the end of the adulterer is portrayed. His end is without a gleam of hope or satisfaction. With an understanding darkened and rendered callous by unrestrained indulgence in lust, and by folly which has reached its utmost limits and cannot, as it were, be surpassed, in that it has persistently and wilfully set aside and scorned wisdom and true happiness, the adulterer, like the drunkard, who is oblivious of the danger before him, shall stagger to ruin. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>That such matters as there are thought of, is manifest from this verse. As &#1494;&#1512;&#1506; comprehends with the cause (sperma) the effect (posterity), so, in <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/5-16.htm">Proverbs 5:16</a>, with the effusio roboris virilis is connected the idea of the beginnings of life. For the subjects of <a href="/proverbs/5-17.htm">Proverbs 5:17</a> are the effusiones seminis named in <a href="/proverbs/5-16.htm">Proverbs 5:16</a>. These in their effects (<a href="/proverbs/5-17.htm">Proverbs 5:17</a>) may belong to thee alone, viz., to thee alone (&#1500;&#1489;&#1491;&#1468;&#1498;, properly in thy separateness) within thy married relation, not, as thou hast fellowship with other women, to different family circles, Aben-Ezra rightly regards as the subject, for he glosses thus: &#1492;&#1508;&#1500;&#1490;&#1497;&#1501; &#1513;&#1473;&#1492;&#1501; &#1492;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; &#1492;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, and Immanuel well explains &#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468;&#1470;&#1500;&#1498; by &#1497;&#1514;&#1497;&#1495;&#1505;&#1493; &#1500;&#1498;. The child born out of wedlock belongs not to the father alone, he knows not to whom it belongs; its father must for the sake of his honour deny it before the world. Thus, as Grotius remarks: ibi sere ubi prolem metas. In &#1493;&#1488;&#1497;&#1503; the &#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493; is continued. It is not thus used adverbially for &#1500;&#1488;, as in the old classic Arabic lyas for l' (Fl.), but it carries in it the force of a verb, so that &#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;, according to rule, in the sense of &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; &#1492;&#1497;&#1493;  equals  &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;, continues it. </body></html>
