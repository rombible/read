Some, by the adulterous woman, here understand idolatry, false doctrine, which tends to lead astray men's minds and manners; but the direct view is to warn against seventh-commandment sins. Often these have been, and still are, Satan's method of drawing men from the worship of God into false religion. Consider how fatal the consequences; how bitter the fruit! Take it any way, it wounds. It leads to the torments of hell. The direct tendency of this sin is to the destruction of body and soul. We must carefully avoid every thing which may be a step towards it. Those who would be kept from harm, must keep out of harm's way. If we thrust ourselves into temptation we mock God when we pray, Lead us not into temptation. How many mischiefs attend this sin! It blasts the reputation; it wastes time; it ruins the estate; it is destructive to health; it will fill the mind with horror. Though thou art merry now, yet sooner or later it will bring sorrow. The convinced sinner reproaches himself, and makes no excuse for his folly. By the frequent acts of sin, the habits of it become rooted and confirmed. By a miracle of mercy true repentance may prevent the dreadful consequences of such sins; but this is not often; far more die as they have lived.

To live virtuously, and avoid the adulterous woman; this he says, as wondering at his stupidity, folly, and madness, that he should hate and abhor that which was so much his interest to have observed. Gersom interprets it of the instruction of the law; but it is much better to understand it of the instruction of the Gospel; which the carnal mind of man is enmity unto, and which they are so stupid as to abhor; when it is of so much usefulness to preserve from error and heresy, superstition, will worship, and idolatry; <p>and my heart despised reproof; for following the whorish woman; and which was secretly despised in the heart, and heartily too, if not expressed with the mouth: it is one part of the Gospel ministry to reprove for false doctrine and false worship, though it generally falls under the contempt of the erroneous and idolatrous. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof;</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - Self-reproach accompanies the unavailable groaning. <span class="cmt_word">And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof!</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> how could it ever come to pass that I have acted in such a senseless and inexcusable manner, that I have hated instruction (<span class="accented">musar, disciplina</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>), the warning voice which dissuaded me from going with the harlot, and in my heart  despised, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> rejected inwardly, whatever my outward demeanour may have been, the reproof which followed after I had been with her! <span class="accented">Despised</span> (<span class="accented">naats</span>), as in <a href="/proverbs/1-30.htm">Proverbs 1:30</a>; comp. also <a href="/proverbs/15-5.htm">Proverbs 15:5</a>, "A fool despiseth his father's instructions." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>If we try to connect the clause beginning with &#1508;&#1468;&#1503; with 5b as its principal sentence: she goes straight to the abyss, so that by no means does she ever tread the way of life (thus e.g., Schultens), or better, with 6b: never more to walk in the way of life, her paths fluctuate hither and thither (as Gr. Venet. and Kamphausen in Bunsen's Bibelwerk, after Bertheau and Ewald, translate); then in the former case more than in the latter the difference of the subject opposes itself, and in the latter, in addition, the &#1500;&#1488; &#1514;&#1491;&#1506;, only disturbing in this negative clause. Also by the arrangement of the words, 6a appears as an independent thought. But with Jewish expositors (Rashi, Aben-Ezra, Ralbag, Malbim, etc.) to interpret &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1505;, after the Talmud (b. Mod katan 9a) and Midrash, as an address is impracticable; the warning: do not weigh the path of life, affords no meaning suitable to this connection - for we must, with Cartwright and J. H. Michaelis, regard 6a as the antecedent to 6b: ne forte semitam vitae ad sequendum eligas, te per varios deceptionum meandros abripit ut non noveris, ubi locorum sis; but then the continuation of the address is to be expected in 6b. No, the subject to &#1514;&#1508;&#1500;&#1501; is the adulteress, and &#1508;&#1468;&#1503; is an intensified &#1500;&#1488;. Thus the lxx, Jerome, Syr., Targ., Luther, Geier, Nolde, and among Jewish interpreters Heidenheim, who first broke with the tradition sanctioned by the Talmud and the Midrash, for he interpreted 6a as a negative clause spoken in the tone of a question. But &#1508;&#1468;&#1503; is not suitable for a question, but for a call. Accordingly, Bttcher explains: viam vitae ne illa complanare studeat! (&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1505; in the meaning complanando operam dare). But the adulteress as such, and the striving to come to the way of life, stand in contradiction: an effort to return must be meant, which, because the power of sin over her is too great, fails; but the words do not denote that, they affirm the direct contrary, viz., that it does not happen to the adulteress ever to walk in the way of life. As in the warning the independent &#1508;&#1468;&#1503; may be equivalent to cave ne (<a href="/job/32-13.htm">Job 32:13</a>), so also in the declaration it may be equivalent to absit ut, for &#1508;&#1468;&#1503; (from &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492;, after the forms &#1489;&#1468;&#1503;  equals  Arab. banj. &#1506;&#1509;  equals  Arab. 'as&#803;j) means turning away, removal. Thus: Far from taking the course of the way of life (which has life as its goal and reward) - for &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1505;, to open, to open a road (<a href="/psalms/78-50.htm">Psalm 78:50</a>), has here the meaning of the open road itself - much rather do her steps wilfully stagger (<a href="/jeremiah/14-10.htm">Jeremiah 14:10</a>) hither and thither, they go without order and without aim, at one time hither, at another time thither, without her observing it; i.e., without her being concerned at this, that she thereby runs into the danger of falling headlong into the yawning abyss. The unconsciousness which the clause &#1500;&#1488; &#1514;&#1491;&#1506; esu expresses, has as its object not the falling (<a href="/psalms/35-8.htm">Psalm 35:8</a>), of which there is here nothing directly said, but just this staggering, vacillation, the danger of which she does not watch against. &#1504;&#1506;&#1493; has Mercha under the &#1506; with Zinnorith preceding; it is Milra [an oxytone] (Michlol 111b); the punctuation varies in the accentuations of the form without evident reason: Olsh. 233, p. 285. The old Jewish interpreters (and recently also Malbim) here, as also at <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/2-16.htm">Proverbs 2:16</a>, by the &#1494;&#1512;&#1492; [strange woman] understand heresy (&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;), or the philosophy that is hostile to revelation; the ancient Christian interpreters understood by it folly (Origen), or sensuality (Procopius), or heresy (Olympiodorus), or false doctrine (Polychronios). The lxx, which translates, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/5-5.htm">Proverbs 5:5</a>, &#1512;&#1490;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492; by &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;, looks toward this allegorical interpretation. But this is unnecessary, and it is proved to be false from <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/5-15.htm">Proverbs 5:15-20</a>, where the &#1494;&#1512;&#1492; is contrasted with the married wife. </body></html>
