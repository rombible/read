The teaching assumes a higher tone, and rises from the lower law which regulates fidelity to the wife, based upon personal attractions, to the higher law, which brings the husband's  conduct into relation with the duty he owes to Jehovah. Not merely is his conduct to be regulated by love and affection alone, but it is to be fashioned by the reflection or consciousness that the Supreme Being presides over all, and takes cognizance of human action. Without losing sight that the marriage contract has its own peculiar obligations, the fact is insisted upon that all a man's ways are open to the eyes of the Lord. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And why</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> what inducement is there, what reason can be given, for conjugal infidelity, except the lewd and immoral promptings of the lower nature, except sensuality in its lowest form? <span class="cmt_word">Ravished</span>. The verb <span class="accented">shagah</span> recurs, but in a lower sense, as indicating "the foolish delirium of the libertine hastening after the harlot" (Zockler). <span class="cmt_word">With a strange woman</span> (Hebrew, <span class="accented">b'zarah</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> with a harlot. On <span class="accented">zarah</span>, see <a href="/proverbs/2-16.htm">Proverbs 2:16</a> and Proverbs 7:5.

On this verb, see <a href="/proverbs/4-8.htm">Proverbs 4:8</a>. <span class="cmt_word">The bosom of a stranger</span> (Hebrew, <span class="accented">kheh nok'riyyah</span>). A parallel expression having the same force as its counterpart. The more usual form of <span class="accented">khek</span> is <span class="accented">kheyk</span>, and means "the bosom" of a person. In <a href="/proverbs/16-33.htm">Proverbs 16:33</a> it is used of the <span class="accented">lap</span>, and in <a href="/proverbs/17-23.htm">Proverbs 17:23</a> and Proverbs 21:14 for the <span class="accented">bosom</span> or <span class="accented">folds</span> of a garment. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>&#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1506;&#1496; with the perf. following is equivalent to: it wanted but a little that this or that should happen, e.g., <a href="/genesis/26-10.htm">Genesis 26:10</a>. It is now for the most part thus explained: it wanted but a little, and led astray by that wicked companionship I would have been drawn away into crime, for which I would then have been subjected to open punishment (Fl.). Ewald understands &#1512;&#1506; directly of punishment in its extreme form, stoning; and Hitzig explains &#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1512;&#1506; by "the totality of evil," in so far as the disgraceful death of the criminal comprehends in it all other evils that are less. But &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1512;&#1506; means, either, into every evil, misfortune, or into every wickedness; and since &#1512;&#1506;, in contradistinction to &#1500;&#1489; (Hitzig compares <a href="/ezekiel/36-5.htm">Ezekiel 36:5</a>), is a conception of a species, then the meaning is equivalent to in omni genere mali. The reference to the death-punishment of the adulteress is excluded thereby, though it cannot be denied that it might be thought of at the same time, if he who too late comes to consider his ways were distinctly designated in the preceding statements as an adulterer. But it is on the whole a question whether &#1489;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1512;&#1506; is meant of the evil which follows sin as its consequence. The usage of the language permits this, cf. <a href="/2_samuel/16-8.htm">2 Samuel 16:8</a>; <a href="/exodus/5-19.htm">Exodus 5:19</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/7-23.htm">1 Chronicles 7:23</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/10-6.htm">Psalm 10:6</a>, but no less the reference to that which is morally bad, cf. <a href="/exodus/32-22.htm">Exodus 32:22</a> (where Keil rightly compares with <a href="/1_john/5-19.htm">1 John 5:19</a>); and &#1492;&#1497;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497; (for which in the first case one expected &#1504;&#1508;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, I fell into, vid., <a href="/proverbs/13-17.htm">Proverbs 13:17</a>; <a href="/proverbs/17-20.htm">Proverbs 17:20</a>; <a href="/proverbs/28-14.htm">Proverbs 28:14</a>) is even more favourable to the latter reference. Also &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;&#1498; &#1511;&#1492;&#1500; &#1493;&#1506;&#1491;&#1492; (cf. on the heaping together of synonyms under 11b), this paraphrase of the palam ac publice, with its &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;&#1498; (cf. <a href="/psalms/111-1.htm">Psalm 111:1</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/20-14.htm">2 Chronicles 20:14</a>), looks rather to a heightening of the moral self-accusation. He found himself in all wickedness, living and moving therein in the midst of the congregation, and thereby giving offence to it, for he took part in the external worship and in the practices of the congregation, branding himself thereby as a hypocrite. That by the one name the congregation is meant in its civil aspect, and by the other in its ecclesiastical aspect, is not to be supposed: in the congregation of the people of the revealed law, the political and the religious sides are not so distinguished. It is called without distinction &#1511;&#1492;&#1500; and &#1506;&#1491;&#1492; (from &#1497;&#1506;&#1491;). Rather we would say that &#1511;&#1492;&#1500; is the whole ecclesia, and &#1506;&#1491;&#1492; the whole of its representatives; but also the great general council bears sometimes the one name (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/12-3.htm">Exodus 12:3</a>, cf. 21) and sometimes the other (<a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-30.htm">Deuteronomy 31:30</a>, cf. 28) - the placing of them together serves thus only to strengthen the conception. </body></html>
