Some, by the adulterous woman, here understand idolatry, false doctrine, which tends to lead astray men's minds and manners; but the direct view is to warn against seventh-commandment sins. Often these have been, and still are, Satan's method of drawing men from the worship of God into false religion. Consider how fatal the consequences; how bitter the fruit! Take it any way, it wounds. It leads to the torments of hell. The direct tendency of this sin is to the destruction of body and soul. We must carefully avoid every thing which may be a step towards it. Those who would be kept from harm, must keep out of harm's way. If we thrust ourselves into temptation we mock God when we pray, Lead us not into temptation. How many mischiefs attend this sin! It blasts the reputation; it wastes time; it ruins the estate; it is destructive to health; it will fill the mind with horror. Though thou art merry now, yet sooner or later it will bring sorrow. The convinced sinner reproaches himself, and makes no excuse for his folly. By the frequent acts of sin, the habits of it become rooted and confirmed. By a miracle of mercy true repentance may prevent the dreadful consequences of such sins; but this is not often; far more die as they have lived.

Warning against adultery, and commendation of marriage.</span> The teacher, in this discourse, recurs to a subject which he has glanced at before in <a href="/proverbs/2-15.htm">Proverbs 2:15-19</a>, and which he again treats of in the latter part of the sixth and in the whole of the seventh chapters. This constant recurrence to the same subject, repulsive on account of its associations, shows, however, the importance which it had in the teacher's estimation as a ground of warning, and that he ranked it among the foremost of the temptations and sins which called the young off from the pursuit of Wisdom, and so led them astray from "the fear of the Lord." The vividness with which the ruin, bodily and moral, ensuing with absolute certainty on a life of vice, is described is a sufficient proof in itself that the subject before us is not brought forward from or for voluptuous motives, but for the purpose of conveying an impressive warning. Some commentators, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Delitzsch, include the first six verses in the previous discourse; but the unity of the subject requires a different treatment. Zockler's reason against this arrangement, on the ground that the previous discourse was addressed to "tender youth," and thus to youth in a state of pupilage, while the one before us refers to more advanced age - to the married man - may be true, but is not the true ground for incorporating them in the present discourse. The unity of the subject requires that they should be taken with the central and didactic part of the discourse, as being in a sense introductory to it. The discourse divides itself into three sections. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The earnest appeal to attention because of the counter-attraction in the blandishments of the harlot, which, however, in the end, are bitter as wormwood and sharp as a two-edged sword (vers. 1-6). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The main or didactic section (vers. 7-20), embracing <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> warnings against adulterous intercourse with "the strange woman" (vers. 7-14); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> the antithetical admonition to use the means of chastity by remaining faithful to, and rejoicing with, the wife of one's youth (vers 15-20). And <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the epilogue, which, in addition to the disastrous temporal consequences which follow on the violation of the sanctity of marriage, mentioned in vers. 9-14, represents the sin as one which will be examined by the universal Judge, and which brings with it its own Nemesis or retribution. All sins of impurity, all sins against <span class="accented">temperance, soberness</span>, and <span class="accented">chastity</span>, are no doubt involved in the warning, and the subject is capable of an allegorical interpretation - a mode of treatment in some instances adopted by the LXX. rendering, as that the "strange woman" stands as the representative of <span class="accented">impenitence</span> (Miller), or, according to the earlier view of Bede, as the representative of heresy and false doctrine; but the sin which is inveighed against, and which is made the subject of these repeated warnings, is not fornication simply, but <span class="accented">adultery</span> - the violation, in its most repulsive form, of the sacred obligations of marriage. The whole discourse is an impressive commentary on the seventh commandment. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - The admonitory address is very similar to that in <a href="/proverbs/4-20.htm">Proverbs 4:20</a>, except that here the teacher says," Attend to <span class="accented">my wisdom</span>, bow down thine ear to <span class="accented">my understanding</span>," instead of "Attend to <span class="accented">my words</span>, and incline thine ear unto <span class="accented">my saying</span>." It is not merely "wisdom" and "understanding" in the abstract, but wisdom which he has appropriated to himself, made his own, and which he knows by experience to be true wisdom. It may therefore have the sense of experience and observation, both of which increase with years. To "bow down the ear" is to listen attentively, and so to fix the mind intently on what is being said. Compare the similar expressions in <a href="/psalms/31-2.htm">Psalm 31:2</a> and <a href="/proverbs/2-2.htm">Proverbs 2:2</a>; <a href="/proverbs/4-20.htm">Proverbs 4:20</a>; 33:12.

This supposed causative meaning it has also here: may they  equals  may one (vid., under <a href="/proverbs/2-22.htm">Proverbs 2:22</a>) not remove them from thine eyes; the object is (<a href="/proverbs/4-20.htm">Proverbs 4:20</a>) the words of the paternal admonition. Hitzig, indeed, observes that "the accusative is not supplied;" but with greater right it is to be remarked that &#1497;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1494;&#1493;&#1468; (fut. Hiph. of &#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494;) and &#1497;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494;&#1493;&#1468; (fut. Kal of id.) are not one and the same, and the less so as &#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1494; occurs, but the masoretical and grammatical authorities (e.g., Kimchi) demand &#1497;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1494;&#1493;&#1468;. The plur. &#1500;&#1502;&#1510;&#1488;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; is continued, 22b, in the sing., for that which is said refers to each one of the many (<a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/3-18.htm">Proverbs 3:18</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/3-28.htm">Proverbs 3:28</a>, <a href="/proverbs/3-35.htm">Proverbs 3:35</a>). &#1502;&#1510;&#1488; is fundamentally an active conception, like our "finden," to find; it means to attain, to produce, to procure, etc. &#1502;&#1512;&#1508;&#1468;&#1488; means, according as the &#1502; is understood of the "that  equals  ut" of the action or of the "what" of its performance, either health or the means of health; here, like &#1512;&#1508;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/3-8.htm">Proverbs 3:8</a>, not with the underlying conception of sickness, but of the fluctuations connected with the bodily life of man, which make needful not only a continual strengthening of it, but also its being again and again restored. Nothing preserves soul and body in a healthier state than when we always keep before our eyes and carry in our hearts the good doctrines; they give to us true guidance on the way of life: "Godliness has the promise of this life, and of that which is to come." <a href="/1_timothy/4-8.htm">1 Timothy 4:8</a>. </body></html>
