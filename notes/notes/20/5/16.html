Or "shall abound", as the Targum; that is, streams of water from fountains; which Aben Ezra interprets of a multitude of children, namely, that are lawfully begotten: the "fountains" are the man and his wife in lawful marriage; the streams are their offspring lawfully procreated by them; which may be said to be "dispersed abroad", when being grown up they are disposed of in marriage in other families, and so become fountains to others, and public blessings; <p>and rivers of waters in the streets; meaning a numerous posterity as before; and such as a man is not ashamed publicly to own, whereas he is ashamed of such as are unlawfully begotten; but these are to his honour in the streets, and for public good; and particularly to those to whom they are given in marriage; see <a href="/isaiah/48-1.htm">Isaiah 48:1</a>. Jarchi interprets this of multiplying disciples, and of teaching them the law publicly, and of getting a name thereby; but it might be interpreted much better of spreading the doctrines of the Gospel, and of the public ministry and profession of that, for the good of others. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, and rivers of waters in the streets.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/5.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">16</span>. <span class="ital">Let thy fountains</span>] This rendering (retained in R.V. marg.) gives a good sense: purity of married life (<span class="ital"><a href="/proverbs/5-15.htm" title="Drink waters out of your own cistern, and running waters out of your own well.">Proverbs 5:15</a></span>) will diffuse itself abroad like streams from a fountain, in a numerous family, and in wholesome influences: but only by such purity can these advantages be secured (<span class="ital"><a href="/proverbs/5-17.htm" title="Let them be only your own, and not strangers' with you.">Proverbs 5:17</a></span>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The rendering of R.V. text, <span class="bld">Should</span> <span class="ital">thy springs</span> &c. with a note of interrogation at the end of the verse, makes however the connection of thought in <span class="ital"><a href="/context/proverbs/5-15.htm" title="Drink waters out of your own cistern, and running waters out of your own well....">Proverbs 5:15-17</a></span> more clear, and is a return to the warning of the earlier verses of the chapter.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, and rivers of waters in the streets.</span> The figurative language is still continued, and under the terms "fountains" and "rivers of waters," are to be understood children, the legitimate issue of lawful marriage. So Aben Ezra and the majority of modern commentators, Schultens, Doderlein, Holden, Muenscher, Noyes, Wardlaw, etc. The meaning appears to be, "Let thy marriage be blessed with many children, who may go forth abroad for the public good." Other interpretations have been adopted. Thus: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Delitzsch takes the words fountans and "rivers of waters" as used figuratively for the procreative power, and renders, "Shall thy streams flow abroad, and water brooks in the streets?" and interprets, "Let generative power act freely and unrestrainedly within the marriage relation." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Schultens and Dathe, followed by Holden, regard the verse as expressing a conclusion on the preceding, "Then shall thy springs be dispersed abroad, even rivers of waters in the streets." The objection to this is that it necessitates the insertion of the copulative <span class="accented">vau</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;</span>) before the verb, <span class="accented">yaphutzu</span>, "be dispersed." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Zockler and Hitzig read the verse interrogatively, "Shall thy streams flow abroad as water brooks in the streets?" on the analogy of <a href="/proverbs/6-30.htm">Proverbs 6:30</a> and <a href="/psalms/56-7.htm">Psalm 56:7</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> The reading of the LXX., adopted by Origen, Clemens Alexandrinus, places a negative before the verb, <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "Let not thy waters flow beyond thy fountain;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "confine thyself to thy wife." <span class="accented">Fountains.</span> The Hebrew <span class="accented">ma'yanim</span>, plural of <span class="accented">mayan</span>, derived from <span class="accented">ayin</span> ("a fountain") with the formative <span class="accented">men</span>, is rather a stream or rill - water flowing on the surface of the ground. It is used, however, of a fountain itself in <a href="/genesis/7-11.htm">Genesis 7:11</a>; <a href="/genesis/8-2.htm">Genesis 8:2</a>. <span class="accented">Rivers of waters</span> (Hebrew, <span class="accented">pal'gey-mayim</span>); rather, <span class="accented">water courses</span>, or <span class="accented">water brooks</span> (cf. <a href="/job/38-25.htm">Job 38:25</a>). The <span class="accented">peleg</span> represents the various streams into which the <span class="accented">mayan</span>, "fountain," divides itself at its source or in its course. We find the same expression, <span class="accented">pal'gey-mayim</span>, used of tears in <a href="/psalms/119-136.htm">Psalm 119:136</a>; <a href="/lamentations/3-48.htm">Lamentations 3:48</a>. It occurs again in our book in <a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>, "The king's heart is in the hand of the Lord as the rivers of waters (<span class="accented">pal'gey mayim</span>)." On "abroad" (Hebrew, <span class="accented">khutz</span>), and "in the streets" (<span class="accented">r'khovoth</span>), see <a href="/proverbs/1-20.htm">Proverbs 1:20</a>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>This other side of the ruin <a href="/proverbs/5-10.htm">Proverbs 5:10</a> presents as an image of terror.

This meaning is probably mediated by means of a metonymy, as <a href="/genesis/4-12.htm">Genesis 4:12</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/31-39.htm">Job 31:39</a>, where the idea of the capability of producing is passed over into that of the produce conformable to it; so here the idea of work-power passes over into that of the gain resulting therefrom. &#1493;&#1506;&#1510;&#1489;&#1497;&#1498; (and thy toils) is not, like &#1499;&#1468;&#1495;&#1498;, the accusative governed by &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;; the carrying over of this verb disturbs the parallelism, and the statement in the passage besides does not accord therewith, which, interpreted as a virtual predicate, presents 10b as an independent prohibitive clause: neve sint labores tui in domo peregrini, not peregrina; at least &#1504;&#1499;&#1512;&#1497; according to the usage of the language is always personal, so that &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; &#1504;&#1499;&#1512;&#1497; (cf. <a href="/lamentations/5-2.htm">Lamentations 5:2</a>), like &#1502;&#1500;&#1489;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473; &#1504;&#1499;&#1512;&#1497;, <a href="//biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-8.htm">Zephaniah 1:8</a>, is to be explained after &#1506;&#1497;&#1512; &#1504;&#1499;&#1512;&#1497;, <a href="/judges/19-12.htm">Judges 19:12</a>. &#1506;&#1510;&#1489; (from &#1506;&#1510;&#1489;, Arab.
