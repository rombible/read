Some, by the adulterous woman, here understand idolatry, false doctrine, which tends to lead astray men's minds and manners; but the direct view is to warn against seventh-commandment sins. Often these have been, and still are, Satan's method of drawing men from the worship of God into false religion. Consider how fatal the consequences; how bitter the fruit! Take it any way, it wounds. It leads to the torments of hell. The direct tendency of this sin is to the destruction of body and soul. We must carefully avoid every thing which may be a step towards it. Those who would be kept from harm, must keep out of harm's way. If we thrust ourselves into temptation we mock God when we pray, Lead us not into temptation. How many mischiefs attend this sin! It blasts the reputation; it wastes time; it ruins the estate; it is destructive to health; it will fill the mind with horror. Though thou art merry now, yet sooner or later it will bring sorrow. The convinced sinner reproaches himself, and makes no excuse for his folly. By the frequent acts of sin, the habits of it become rooted and confirmed. By a miracle of mercy true repentance may prevent the dreadful consequences of such sins; but this is not often; far more die as they have lived.

The poet derives the warning against intercourse with the adulteress from the preceding discourse, and grounds it on the destructive consequences.<p>7 And now, ye sons, hearken unto me,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; And depart not from the words of my mouth.<p>8 Hold thy path far from her neighbourhood,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; And come not to the door of her house!<p>9 That thou mayest not give the freshness of thy youth to another,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor thy years to the cruel one;<p>10 That strangers may not sate themselves with thy possessions,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; And the fruit of thy toils come into the house of a stranger,<p>11 And thou groanest at the end,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; When thy flesh and thy body are consumed.<p>Neither here nor in the further stages of this discourse is there any reference to the criminal punishment inflicted on the adulterer, which, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/20-10.htm">Leviticus 20:10</a>, consisted in death, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-40.htm">Ezekiel 16:40</a>, cf. John. P<a href="//biblehub.com/romans/8-5.htm">Romans 8:5</a>, in stoning, and according to a later traditional law, in strangulation (&#1495;&#1504;&#1511;). Ewald finds in <a href="/proverbs/5-14.htm">Proverbs 5:14</a> a play on this punishment of adultery prescribed by law, and reads from <a href="/proverbs/5-9.htm">Proverbs 5:9</a>. that the adulterer who is caught by the injured husband was reduced to the state of a slave, and was usually deprived of his manhood. But that any one should find pleasure in making the destroyer of his wife his slave is a far-fetched idea, and neither the law nor the history of Israel contains any evidence for this punishment by slavery or the mutilation of the adulterer, for which Ewald refers to Grimm's Deutsche Rechtsaltertmer. The figure which is here sketched by the poet is very different. He who goes into the net of the wanton woman loses his health and his goods. She stands not alone, but has her party with her, who wholly plunder the simpleton who goes into her trap. Nowhere is there any reference to the husband of the adulteress. The poet does not at all think on a married woman. And the word chosen directs our attention rather to a foreigner than to an Israelitish woman, although the author may look upon harlotry as such as heathenish rather than Israelitish, and designate it accordingly. The party of those who make prostitutes of themselves consists of their relations and their older favourites, the companions of their gain, who being in league with her exhaust the life-strength and the resources of the befooled youth (Fl.). This discourse begins with &#1493;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;, for it is connected by this concluding application (cf. <a href="/proverbs/7-24.htm">Proverbs 7:24</a>) with the preceding.</body></html>
