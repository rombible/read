But we are not properly united, except as we attend to God's word, seeking his direction and blessing, and acting with affection. Ever remember, that though secret sins may escape the eyes of our fellow-creatures, yet a man's ways are before the eyes of the Lord, who not only sees, but ponders all his goings.

Promiscuous and unlawful intercourse throws doubt upon the paternity of children. Thy children may be thine, they may belong to another. The natural pride which is felt in a legitimate offspring is the motive put forward to commend the husband to confine himself exclusively to his wife. Grotius on this verse remarks, "Ibi sere ubi prolem metas" - "Sow there where you may reap an offspring." <span class="accented">Them</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the children referred to figuratively in the preceding verse, from which the subject of this verse is supplied. The repetition of the pronoun which occurs in the original, "let them belong to thee, to thee," is emphatic, and exclusive of others. The latter clause of the verse, "and not strangers' with thee," covers the whole ground. The idea of their being strangers' is repulsive, and so gives further point to the exhortation. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The fut. &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468; and the &#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468; needed to complete 10b are continued in <a href="/proverbs/5-11.htm">Proverbs 5:11</a> in the consec. perf. &#1504;&#1492;&#1501;, elsewhere of the hollow roaring of the sea, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/5-30.htm">Isaiah 5:30</a>, the growling of the lion, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/28-15.htm">Proverbs 28:15</a>, here, as also <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-23.htm">Ezekiel 24:23</a>, of the hollow groaning of men; a word which echoes the natural sound, like &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;, &#1492;&#1502;&#1492;.

That wherein the end consists to which the deluded youth is brought, and the sorrowful sound of despair extorted from him, is stated in 11b: his flesh is consumed away, for sensuality and vexation have worked together to undermine his health. The author here connects together two synonyms to strengthen the conception, as if one said: All thy tears and thy weeping help thee nothing (Fl.); he loves this heaping together of synonyms, as we have shown at p. 33.
