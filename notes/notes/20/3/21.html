Meaning not the things done by Wisdom; though it is good to contemplate his works of creation and providence, which serve to set forth the glory of Christ, and lead into adoring and admiring views of him, and to thankfulness to him; but wisdom, understanding, and knowledge, whereby these things are done, which are but so many names of Christ: we should always set him before us, keep him always in view, be ever looking to him by faith, and never suffer him to depart from our eyes; we should always have in sight his divine Person for our acceptance with God, the greatness and glory of it to encourage our faith and hope in him; we should keep in view his righteousness for our justification, and which we should ever make mention of at the throne of grace, and hold it forth in the hand of faith against all charges and accusations of law and justice, Satan, or our own hearts; we should be continually looking to his blood for peace and pardon, healing and cleansing; and our eyes should be at all times on his fulness, for fresh supplies of grace, for spiritual food, or the daily bread of our souls, and for spiritual strength and comfort; we should always consider him as the Saviour, and be exercising faith on him as such, for there is no other; and should always look upon him as the Mediator between God and man, and make use of him; and he should be ever before us as our example, both in the exercise of grace and performance of duty, to copy after; and we should always keep sight of him while running our Christian race, as the forerunner for us entered, and as the mark for the prize of the high calling of God. And not only Wisdom, or Christ, but all the things that are said of him in the context, we should never lose sight of; the exceeding great gain got by him, the superlative preciousness of him, the fulness of blessings in both his hands, the pleasantness and peaceableness of his ways, the usefulness of him as a tree of life to those that lay hold upon him and retain him, and the works of nature and providence done by him, <a href="/proverbs/3-14.htm">Proverbs 3:14</a>. Moreover, this may include all the truths and doctrines of Wisdom, or Christ; for, if the law and its precepts were to be upon the hands and as frontlets between the eyes of the Israelites, and so be ever in sight, then much more the doctrines of the Gospel, <a href="/deuteronomy/6-8.htm">Deuteronomy 6:8</a>. It is observable that the Septuagint here makes use of the same word the apostle does in <a href="/hebrews/2-1.htm">Hebrews 2:1</a>; speaking of Gospel truths; See Gill on <a href="/hebrews/2-1.htm">Hebrews 2:1</a>; these are meant in the next clause; and some by a transposition place them thus, "let not sound wisdom and discretion depart from thine eyes, keep" them; for by <p>sound wisdom is meant sound doctrine, the wholesome words of Christ, the solid and substantial truths of the Gospel. The Vulgate Latin version renders it, "keep the law"; but the Syriac version, much better, "keep my doctrine", the doctrine of the Gospel; which also is meant by <p>discretion, or "counsel" (d), as some render the word, and as the Gospel is called, <a href="/acts/20-27.htm">Acts 20:27</a>; this should be kept; the doctrines of it should be held fast and not let go, or be departed from; and the ordinances of it should be observed and kept, as they were delivered, from a principle of love, and a view to the glory of Christ; the advantages arising from them follow. <p>(d)   Sept.

The reading of the LXX., <span class="greekheb">μὴ παραρυῇς</span>, is interesting in connection with <span class="greekheb">παραρυῶμεν</span>, <a href="/hebrews/2-1.htm" title="Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip.">Hebrews 2:1</a>, where see notes in this Series and in Dean Vaughan’s Commentary.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My son, let not them depart from thine eyes.</span> After the description of the power of Wisdom exhibited in creating and sustaining the earth, the exhortation to keep Wisdom steadily before the eyes, and the promises of Divine protection, appropriately follow. Since Wisdom is so powerful, then, the teacher argues, she is worthy of being retained and guarded, and able to protect. <span class="accented">Let them not depart</span> (<span class="accented">al-yaluzu</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "let them not escape or slip aside from your mind (cf. Vulgate, <span class="accented">ne</span> <span class="accented">effluant haec ab oculis ruts</span>). They are to be as frontiers between your eyes, as a ring upon your finger. <span class="accented">Yaluzu</span>, from <span class="accented">luz</span>, "to bend aside," <span class="accented">defiectere, a via declinare</span>, which see in <a href="/proverbs/2-15.htm">Proverbs 2:15</a>, ought probably to be written <span class="accented">yellezu</span>, on the analogy of the corresponding passage in <a href="/proverbs/4-21.htm">Proverbs 4:21</a>. The LXX. renders absolutely <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x1f7b;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, "do not thou pass by," from <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;</span>, "to flow by," "to pass by, recede" (cf. <a href="/hebrews/2-1.htm">Hebrews 2:1</a>, "Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to these things, lest at any time we should let them slip (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x3c5;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>)," quoted probably from the LXX. of this passage). The Targum Jonathan reads <span class="accented">ne vilescat</span>, "let it," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> wisdom, "not become worthless." <span class="accented">Them</span>, included in the verb <span class="accented">yaluzu</span> of which it is subject in the original, is to be referred either to "sound wisdom and discretion" of ver. 21b - so Gejerus, Cartwright, Geier, Umbreit, Hitzig, Zockter, Plumptre (a similar trajection occurs in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-5.htm">Deuteronomy 32:5</a>, and is used, as here, to give vividness to the description): or to "wisdom, understanding, knowledge," of the preceding verses - so Delitzsch and Holden. The first view in every way seems preferable, and it is no objection to it that "sound wisdom" (<span class="accented">tushiyyah</span>) and "discretion" (<span class="accented">m'yimmah</span>) are feminine, while the verb "depart" (<span class="accented">yaluzu</span>) is masculine (see Gesenius, *Gram.,' &sect; 147). The Syriac reads, "Let it not become worthless (<span class="accented">ne vile fit</span>) in thine eyes to keep my doctrine and my counsels." <span class="cmt_word">Keep sound wisdom and discretion.</span> <span class="accented">Keep</span>; <span class="accented">n'zor</span>, kal imperative of <span class="accented">natsar</span>, "to watch, guard." For "sound wisdom" (<span class="accented">tushiyyah</span>), see <a href="/proverbs/2-7.htm">Proverbs 2:7</a>. Here used for "wisdom" (<span class="accented">kokhmah</span>), as "discretion" (<span class="accented">m'zimmah</span>) for "understanding" (<span class="accented">t'vunah</span>), to contrast the absolute wisdom and insight of God with the corresponding attributes in man (see Zockler, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>). They belong to God, but are conferred on those who seek after Wisdom, and are then to be guarded as priceless treasures. The Vulgate reads, <span class="accented">custodi legem et consilium</span>; and the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, "<span class="accented">g</span>uard my counsel and thought." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>As regards &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, for which the Kethb has &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, the following things are in favour of the fundamental meaning "corals," viz.: (1.) The name itself, which corresponds with the Arab. fann; this word, proceeding from the root-idea of shooting forth, particularly after the manner of plants, means the branch and all that raises or multiplies itself branch-like or twig-like (Fleischer). (2.) The redness attributed to the &#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/4-7.htm">Lamentations 4:7</a>, in contradistinction to the pure whiteness attributed to snow and milk (vid., at <a href="/job/28-18.htm">Job 28:18</a>). The meaning of the word may, however, have become generalized in practice (lxx in loc. &#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;, Graec. Venet. &#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;); the meaning "pearls," given to it in the Job-Targum by Rashi, and particularly by Bochart, lay so much the nearer as one may have wrought also corals and precious stones, such as the carbuncle, sardius, and sapphire, into the form of pearls. &#1497;&#1511;&#1512;&#1492;, in consequence of the retrogression of the tone, has Munach on the penult., and that as an exception, as has been remarked by the Masora, since in substantives and proper names terminating in  &#1492; the &#1504;&#1505;&#1493;&#1490; &#1488;&#1495;&#1493;&#1512;, i.e., the receding of the tone, does not elsewhere appear, e.g., &#1497;&#1508;&#1492; &#1492;&#1497;&#1488;, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/12-14.htm">Genesis 12:14</a>, &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492; &#1492;&#1497;&#1488;, Sol 6:9, &#1510;&#1512;&#1492; &#1492;&#1497;&#1488;, <a href="/jeremiah/30-7.htm">Jeremiah 30:7</a>. &#1495;&#1508;&#1509; is first abstr., a being inclined to something, lust, will, pleasure in anything, then also concr., anything in which one has pleasure, what is beautiful, precious; cf. Arab. nf&#305;&#770;s, _hyy, hence hja&#770;rt nf&#305;&#770;st, precious stones" (Fleischer). &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1492; with &#1489; means to be an equivalent (purchase-price, exchange) for anything; the most natural construction in Arab. as well as in Hebr. is that with &#1500;, to be the equivalent of a thing (vid., at <a href="/job/33-27.htm">Job 33:27</a>); the &#1489; is the Beth pretii, as if one said in Arab.: biabi anta thou art in the estimate of my father, I give it for thee. One distinctly perceives in <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/3-14.htm">Proverbs 3:14</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/3-15.htm">Proverbs 3:15</a>, the echo of <a href="//biblehub.com/job/28.htm">Job 28</a>. This tetrastich occurs again with a slight variation at <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/8-10.htm">Proverbs 8:10-11</a>. The Talmud and the Midrash accent it so, that in the former the expression is &#1493;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1495;&#1508;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501;, and in the latter &#1493;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1495;&#1508;&#1510;&#1497;&#1498;, and they explain the latter of precious stones and pearls (&#1488;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; &#1496;&#1493;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; &#1493;&#1502;&#1512;&#1490;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514;). </body></html>
