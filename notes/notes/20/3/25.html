The latter is probably the right interpretation, and agrees with the threatening language of Wisdom against her despisers, in <a href="/proverbs/1-27.htm">Proverbs 1:27</a>, where <span class="accented">shdath</span> also occurs. Iu the desolation which shall overwhelm the wicked he who has made Wisdom his guide shall be undismayed, for the Lord is his confidence.

Lee, <span class="accented">in loc. cit.</span>, says the places are almost innumerable where this sentiment occurs.

The parallel Pil. of &#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503; (Arab. ka&#770;n, cogn. &#1499;&#1492;&#1503;, see on Isaiah, p. 691) signifies to set up, to restore; here equivalent to, to give existence.</body></html>
