The wise are the same with the just and lowly before mentioned, to whom God gives grace, and to these he gives glory. The "wise" are such who are so, not in a natural, civil, or notional sense, or that are wise in the things of nature, in civil affairs and in speculative matters of religion; but in a spiritual sense, who are wise unto salvation; who know themselves, the sinfulness of their nature, their inability to do that which is good, and their want of righteousness to justify them before God; who are sensible of the sickness and diseases of their souls, their spiritual poverty, and their great folly and ignorance with respect to things of a spiritual nature; who know Christ, and him crucified, the way of peace, pardon, righteousness, and salvation by him; that know him, not only notionally, but so as to apply unto him, and rest on him for salvation; who build it on him the foundation, on him only, and give him all the glory of it; and who have also a competent knowledge of the Gospel, and a comfortable experience of the truths of it; and who take up a profession of religion upon such an experience, and hold it fast without depending on it, and have a conversation becoming it, walking circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise. Now these shall "inherit glory"; not the glory of this world, or honour among men in it; but the glory of another, of which the glory of this world, and of, he most excellent things in it, is but a faint resemblance: it is unseen, inconceivable, and incomparable; it is an eternal glory which Christ is entered into, and the same the Father has given him; and will lie in the vision of God, and communion with him; in beholding the glory of Christ, and in having a glory put upon them both in soul and body: and this they shall enjoy as an inheritance; not by purchase or acquisition, but by free gift; as a bequest of their Father; which comes to them as children, through the death of Christ the testator, and will be possessed for ever, as inheritances run; <p>but shame shall be the promotion of fools; not fools in a natural, but in a religious sense; such who know not themselves, nor the way of salvation; who mock at sin, and scoff at religion: these and everyone of these "shall take" or "lift up shame" (m), as their part and portion, alluding to the heave offering under the law, in opposition to the glory the wise shall inherit and possess. Or, "shame shall lift up fools" (n); hold them forth, and make them manifest and conspicuous: all the promotion they shall be raised unto will be only shame and confusion, if not in this world, yet in that to come; for, when they shall rise from the dead, it will be "to shame and everlasting contempt", <a href="/daniel/12-2.htm">Daniel 12:2</a>.

They "glory in their shame" (<a href="/philippians/2-19.htm">Philippians 2:19</a>); or shame renders them conspicuous as warning examples (Ewald); or, as Dathe explains it, "Stulti infamia sunt famosi," "Fools become famous by infamy;" or as Rabbi Levi, "Shame exalts them as into the air, and makes them vanish away." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The LXX. renders, <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f55;&#x3c8;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "Fools exalt shame, prize what others despise" (Plumptre). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Umbreit, Bertheau, Zockler, render, "Shame sweeps fools away," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> lifts them up in order to sweep away and destroy them (cf. <a href="/isaiah/57-14.htm">Isaiah 57:14</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> The true rendering seems to be given by Michaelis, "Fools carry away shame" as their portion. So the Targum, Delitzsch, Hitzig, Wordsworth. They look for "promotion." They attain such as it is, but the end of their attainments is "shame and everlasting contempt."

But the word means as commonly to plough, i.e., to cut with the plough, and &#1495;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; is used also of a ploughman, and, without any addition to it, it always has this meaning. It is then a question whether the metaphorical phrase &#1512;&#1506;&#1492; &#1495;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; signifies to fabricate evil, cf. dolorum faber, mendacia procudere, &#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;, and the Homeric &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; (Fleischer and most others), or to plough evil (Rashi, Ewald, etc.). The Targ., Syriac, and Jerome translate &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;, without deciding the point, by moliri; but the lxx and Graecus Venet. by &#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;. The correctness of these renderings is not supported by <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-36.htm">Ezekiel 21:36</a>, where &#1495;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1497;&#1514; are not such as fabricate destruction, but smiths who cause destruction; also &#1502;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-9.htm">1 Samuel 23:9</a>, proves nothing, and probably does not at all appertain to &#1495;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; incidere (Keil), but to &#1495;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; silere, in the sense of dolose moliri. On the one hand, it is to be observed from <a href="/job/4-8.htm">Job 4:8</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/10-13.htm">Hosea 10:13</a>, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/129-3.htm">Psalm 129:3</a>, that the meaning arare malum might connect itself with &#1495;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; &#1512;&#1506;&#1492;; and the proverb of Sirach 7:12, &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; &#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0; &#787; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#837;&#834; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;, places this beyond a doubt. Therefore in this phrase, if one keeps before him a clear perception of the figure, at one time the idea of fabricating, at another that of ploughing, is presented before us. The usage of the language in the case before us is more in favour of the latter than of the former. Whether &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; &#1488;&#1514; means to dwell together with, or as Bttcher, to sit together with, after <a href="/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/26-4.htm">Psalm 26:4</a>., need not be a matter of dispute. It means in general a continued being together, whether as sitting, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/2-13.htm">Job 2:13</a>, or as dwelling, <a href="/judges/17-11.htm">Judges 17:11</a>.<p>(Note: Accentuate &#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1488;&#1470;&#1497;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; &#1500;&#1489;&#1496;&#1495;. It is thus in correct texts.
