He who keeps "sound wisdom and discretion" shall enjoy the greatest sense of security in all situations of life. <span class="accented">Safely</span> (<span class="accented">lavetakh</span>); either in confidence, as Vulgate <span class="accented">fiducialiter, i.e.</span> confidently, because of the sense of security (cf. LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x1f7c;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x1fc3;</span>, and ver. 26); or in security: the adverb <span class="accented">lavetakh</span> is equivalent to <span class="accented">betakh</span> in <a href="/proverbs/1-30.htm">Proverbs 1:30</a> and Proverbs 10:9. The allusion is obvious. As he who is accompanied by an escort proceeds on his way in safety, so you protected by God will pass your life in security; or, as Trapp, "Thou shalt ever go under a double guard, 'the peace of God' within thee (<a href="/philippians/4-7.htm">Philippians 4:7</a>), and the 'power of God' without thee (<a href="/1_peter/1-5.htm">1 Peter 1:5</a>)." <span class="cmt_word">And thy foot shall not stumble;</span> literally, <span class="accented">and thou shall not strike thy foot. Stumble</span> in the original is <span class="accented">thiggoph</span>, 2 singular kal future of <span class="accented">nagaph</span>, "to smite, .... strike against with the foot." So in <a href="/psalms/91-12.htm">Psalm 91:12</a>. The Authorized Version, however, correctly gives the sense. The LXX., like the Authorized Version, makes "foot" the subject, <span class="greek">&#x1f49;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f7a;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c8;&#x1fc3;</span>, "(That) thy foot may not stumble." For a similar assurance, see <a href="/proverbs/4-12.htm">Proverbs 4:12</a>. The meaning is: You will not stumble, because you will be walking in the way of wisdom, which is free from stumbling blocks (Lapide). You will not fall into sin. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>&#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1499;&#1497;&#1470;&#1504;&#1506;&#1501; are ways on which one obtains what is agreeable to the inner and the outer man, and which it does good to enjoy. The parallel &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501; is not a genitive to &#1504;&#1514;&#1497;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; to be supplied; that paths of Wisdom are themselves &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501;, for she brings well-being on all sides and deep inwards satisfaction (peace). In regard to &#1504;&#1514;&#1497;&#1489;&#1492;, via eminens, elata, Schultens is right (vid., under <a href="/proverbs/1-15.htm">Proverbs 1:15</a>);<p>(Note: The root is not &#1514;&#1489;, to grope, but &#1504;&#1514;; whence Arab. natt, to bubble up, nata&#770;, to raise oneself, to swell up, etc.)<p>&#1504;&#1514;&#1497;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1492; has Munach, and instead of the Metheg, Tarcha, vid., under <a href="/proverbs/1-31.htm">Proverbs 1:31</a>. The figure of the tree of life the fruit of which brings immortality, is, as <a href="/proverbs/11-30.htm">Proverbs 11:30</a>; <a href="/proverbs/15-4.htm">Proverbs 15:4</a> (cf. <a href="/proverbs/13-12.htm">Proverbs 13:12</a>), <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/2-7.htm">Revelation 2:7</a>, taken from the history of paradise in the Book of Genesis. The old ecclesiastical saying, Lignum vitae crux Christi, accommodates itself in a certain measure, through <a href="/matthew/11-19.htm">Matthew 11:19</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/11-49.htm">Luke 11:49</a>, with this passage of the Book of Proverbs. &#1492;&#1495;&#1494;&#1497;&#1511; &#1489; means to fasten upon anything, more fully expressed in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/21-18.htm">Genesis 21:18</a>, to bind the hand firm with anything, to seize it firmly. They who give themselves to Wisdom, come to experience that she is a tree of life whose fruit contains and communicates strength of life, and whoever always keeps fast hold of Wisdom is blessed, i.e., to be pronounced happy (<a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/41-3.htm">Psalm 41:3</a>, vid., under <a href="/psalms/137-8.htm">Psalm 137:8</a>). The predicate &#1502;&#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1512;, blessed, refers to each one of the &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1499;&#1497;&#1492;, those who hold her, cf. <a href="/proverbs/27-16.htm">Proverbs 27:16</a>; <a href="/numbers/24-9.htm">Numbers 24:9</a>. It is the so-called distributive singular of the predicate, which is freely used particularly in those cases where the plur. of the subject is a participle (vid., under <a href="/proverbs/3-35.htm">Proverbs 3:35</a>). </body></html>
