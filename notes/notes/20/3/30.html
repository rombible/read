We are nat to strive or quarrel with a man unless he has first given us offence. So Le Clerc, "Nisi injuria prior lacessiverit." The admonition is directed against those who, from spite, jealousy, or other reasons, "stir up strife all the day long" with those who are quiet and peaceable. Strive. The Keri here reads <span class="accented">tariv</span> for the Khetib <span class="accented">taruv</span>, but without any change of meaning. The verb <span class="accented">ruv</span>, from which <span class="accented">taruv</span>, is "to strive or contend with the hand and with blows," as in <a href="/deuteronomy/33-7.htm">Deuteronomy 33:7</a>; or with words, as in <a href="/psalms/103-9.htm">Psalm 103:9</a> (cf. the Vulgate, <span class="accented">ne contendas</span>; and the LXX, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, "Do not exercise enmity," from the unusual <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;</span>. <span class="accented">Ruv</span> is here followed by <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">im</span>), as in <a href="/job/9-3.htm">Job 9:3</a>; <a href="/job/40-2.htm">Job 40:2</a>; and <a href="/genesis/26-30.htm">Genesis 26:30</a> Its forensic sense, "to contend with in law," does not strictly apply here, though the precept may be taken as discouraging litigation (Lapide). <span class="cmt_word">Without cause</span> (<span class="accented">khinnam</span>); LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>, equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;</span>, in <a href="/john/15-25.htm">John 15:25</a>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">frustra</span>; further explained in the concluding clause (see on Proverbs 1:17). <span class="cmt_word">If he have done thee no harm.</span> The phrase, <span class="accented">gumal raah</span>, is to bring evil upon any one (Schultens). The verb <span class="accented">gamal</span> signifies "to do, to give, to show to any one." Holdea renders, "Surely he will return thee evil," in the sense that unprovoked attack ensures retaliation.]gut this is to ignore the negative force of <span class="accented">im-lo</span>, "if not." The verb sometimes means "requiting," but not in the passage before us, nor in <a href="/proverbs/11-17.htm">Proverbs 11:17</a>; <a href="/proverbs/31-12.htm">Proverbs 31:12</a>. The Vulgate renders as the Authorized Version, <span class="accented">Cum ipse tibi nihil mali fecerit.</span> It is to be remarked that this precept falls below the moral standard of the New Testament teaching (see <a href="/matthew/5-39.htm">Matthew 5:39-41</a>; <a href="/romans/12-17.htm">Romans 12:17-21</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/6-6.htm">1 Corinthians 6:6-8</a>), and of the example of our Lord, of whom it was predicted that "When he was reviled, be reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not" (see <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>But more than this, wisdom makes its possessor in all situations of life confident in God:<p>23 Then shalt thou go thy way with confidence,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And thy foot shall not stumble.<p>24 When thou liest down, thou are not afraid,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But thou layest thyself down and hast sweet sleep.<p>25 Thou needest not be afraid of sudden alarm,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor for the storm of the wicked when it breaketh forth.<p>26 For Jahve will be thy confidence<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And keep thy foot from the snare.<p>The &#1500;&#1489;&#1496;&#1495; (cf. our "bei guter Laune"  equals  in good cheer), with &#1500; of the condition, is of the same meaning as the conditional adverbial accusative &#1489;&#1468;&#1496;&#1495;, <a href="/proverbs/10-9.htm">Proverbs 10:9</a>; <a href="/proverbs/1-33.htm">Proverbs 1:33</a>. <a href="/proverbs/3-23.htm">Proverbs 3:23</a> the lxx translate &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787; &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c8;&#x3b7;&#837;, while, on the contrary, at <a href="/psalms/91-12.htm">Psalm 91:12</a> they make the person the subject (&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b5; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c8;&#x3b7;&#837;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;.&#x3c4;.&#x3bb;.); here also we retain more surely the subject from 23a, especially since for the intrans. of &#1504;&#1490;&#1507; (to smite, to push) a Hithpa. &#1492;&#1514;&#1504;&#1490;&#1468;&#1507; is used <a href="/jeremiah/13-16.htm">Jeremiah 13:16</a>. In <a href="/proverbs/3-24.htm">Proverbs 3:24</a> there is the echo of <a href="//biblehub.com/job/11-18.htm">Job 11:18</a>, and in <a href="/proverbs/3-25.htm">Proverbs 3:25</a> of <a href="/job/5-21.htm">Job 5:21</a>. <a href="/proverbs/3-24.htm">Proverbs 3:24</a> is altogether the same as <a href="/job/5-24.htm">Job 5:24</a> : et decumbes et suavis erit somnus tuus  equals  si decubueris, suavis erit. The hypothetic perf., according to the sense, is both there and at <a href="/job/11-18.htm">Job 11:18</a> (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/20-9.htm">Jeremiah 20:9</a>) oxytoned as perf. consec. Similar examples are <a href="/proverbs/6-22.htm">Proverbs 6:22</a>; <a href="/genesis/33-13.htm">Genesis 33:13</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-31.htm">1 Samuel 25:31</a>, cf. Ewald, 357a. &#1506;&#1512;&#1489;&#1492; (of sleep as <a href="/jeremiah/31-26.htm">Jeremiah 31:26</a>) is from &#1506;&#1512;&#1489;, which in Hebr. is used of pleasing impressions, as the Arab. &#8219;ariba of a lively, free disposition. &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492;, somnus (nom. actionis from &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1503;, with the ground-form sina preserved in the Arab. lidat, vid., Job, p. 284, note), agrees in inflexion with &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492;, annus. &#1488;&#1500;, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/3-25.htm">Proverbs 3:25</a>, denies, like <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/121-3.htm">Psalm 121:3</a>, with emphasis: be afraid only not  equals  thou hast altogether nothing to fear. Schultens rightly says: Subest species prohibitionis et tanquam abominationis, ne tale quicquam vel in suspicionem veniat in mentemve cogitando admittatur. &#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1491; here means terror, as <a href="/proverbs/1-26.htm">Proverbs 1:26</a>., the terrific object; &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1488;&#1501; (with the accus. om) is the virtual genitive, as <a href="/proverbs/26-2.htm">Proverbs 26:2</a> &#1495;&#1504;&#1468;&#1501; (with accus. am). Regarding &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1492;, see under <a href="/proverbs/1-27.htm">Proverbs 1:27</a>. The genitive &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; may be, after <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/37-18.htm">Psalm 37:18</a>, the genit. subjecti, but still it lies nearer to say that he who chooses the wisdom of God as his guiding star has no ground to fear punishment as transgressors have reason to fear it; the &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1492; is meant which wisdom threatens against transgressors, <a href="/proverbs/1-27.htm">Proverbs 1:27</a>. He needs have no fear of it, for wisdom is a gift of God, and binds him who receives it to the giver: Jahve becomes and is henceforth his confidence. Regarding &#1489; essentiae, which expresses the closest connection of the subject with the predicate which it introduces, see under <a href="/psalms/35-2.htm">Psalm 35:2</a>. As here, so also at <a href="/exodus/18-4.htm">Exodus 18:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/118-7.htm">Psalm 118:7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/146-6.htm">Psalm 146:6</a>, the predicate is a noun with a pronominal suffix. &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1500; is, as at <a href="/psalms/78-7.htm">Psalm 78:7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/31-24.htm">Job 31:24</a>, cognate to &#1502;&#1489;&#1496;&#1492; and &#1502;&#1511;&#1493;&#1492;,<p>(Note: According to Malbim, &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1493;&#1492; is the expectation of good, and &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1500;, confidence in the presence of evil.)<p>the object and ground of confidence. That the word in other connections may mean also fool-hardiness, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/49-14.htm">Psalm 49:14</a>, and folly, <a href="/ecclesiastes/7-25.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:25</a> (cf. regarding &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1497;&#1500;, which in Arab. as bel&#305;&#770;d denotes the dull, in Hebr. fools, see under <a href="/proverbs/1-22.htm">Proverbs 1:22</a>), it follows that it proceeds from the fundamental conception of fulness of flesh and of fat, whence arise the conceptions of dulness and slothfulness, as well as of confidence, whether confidence in self or in God (see Schultens l.c., and Wnsche's Hosea, p. 207f.). &#1500;&#1499;&#1491; is taking, catching, as in a net or trap or pit, from &#1500;&#1499;&#1491;, to catch (cf. Arab. lakida, to fasten, III, IV to hold fast); another root-meaning, in which Arab. lak connects itself with nak, nk, to strike, to assail (whence al-lakdat, the assault against the enemy, Deutsch. Morgenl. Zeitsch. xxii. 140), is foreign to the Hebr. Regarding the &#1502;&#1503; of &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1491;, Fleischer remarks: "The &#1502;&#1503; after the verbs of guarding, preserving, like &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512; and &#1504;&#1510;&#1512;, properly expresses that one by those means holds or seeks to hold a person or thing back from something, like the Lat. defendere, tueri aliquem ab hostibus, a perculo."<p>(Note: Hitzig rejects <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/3-22.htm">Proverbs 3:22-26</a> as a later interpolation. And why? Because chap. 3, which he regards as a complete discourse, consists of twice ten verses beginning with &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;. In addition to this symmetry other reasons easily reveal themselves to his penetration. But the discourses contained in chap. 1-9 do not all begin with &#1489;&#1504;&#1497; (vid., <a href="/proverbs/1-20.htm">Proverbs 1:20</a>); and when it stands in the beginning of the discourse, it is not always the first word (vid., <a href="/proverbs/1-8.htm">Proverbs 1:8</a>); and when it occurs as the first word or in the first line, it does not always commence a new discourse (vid., <a href="/proverbs/1-15.htm">Proverbs 1:15</a> in the middle of the first, <a href="/proverbs/3-11.htm">Proverbs 3:11</a> in the middle of the fourth); and, moreover, the Hebr. poetry and oratory does not reckon according to verses terminated by Soph Pasuk, which are always accented distichs, but they in reality frequently consist of three or more lines. The rejected verses are in nothing unlike those that remain, and which are undisputed; they show the same structure of stichs, consisting for the most part of three, but sometimes also only of two words (cf. <a href="/proverbs/3-22.htm">Proverbs 3:22</a> with <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/1-9.htm">Proverbs 1:9</a>, <a href="/proverbs/1-10.htm">Proverbs 1:10</a>), the same breadth in the course of the thoughts, and the same accord with Job and Deuteronomy.) </body></html>
