Let not mercy and truth forsake thee; God's mercy in promising, and his truth in performing: live up to them, keep up thine interest in them, and take the comfort of them. We must trust in the Lord with all our hearts, believing he is able and wise to do what is best. Those who know themselves, find their own understandings a broken reed, which, if they lean upon, will fail. Do not design any thing but what is lawful, and beg God to direct thee in every case, though it may seem quite plain. In all our ways that prove pleasant, in which we gain our point, we must acknowledge God with thankfulness. In all our ways that prove uncomfortable, and that are hedged up with thorns, we must acknowledge him with submission.

Not in a creature, the best, the holiest, and the highest; not in any creature enjoyment, as riches, strength, and wisdom; nor in any outward privilege, arising from natural descent and education; not in a man's self, in his own heart, which is deceitful; nor in any works of righteousness done by him; not in a profession of religion, or the duties of it, ever so well performed; not in frames, nor in graces, and the exercise of them; no, not in faith or trust itself: but in the Lord, the object of all grace, and in him only; in Jehovah the Father, as the God of nature and providence, for all temporal blessings; and as the God of all grace, for all spiritual blessings, and all the needful supplies of grace; and for eternal happiness, which he has provided, promised, and freely gives. Trust in him at all times; in times of affliction, temptation, and darkness: there is a great deal of reason for it; all power and strength are in him to help; his love, grace, and mercy, move him to it, and are always the same: the consideration of what he has done for others that have trusted in him, and for ourselves in times past, should induce and encourage to it; as also the happiness of those that trust in him, who enjoy peace and safety; and his displeasure at those that show any diffidence of him, or distrust him. Trust in Jehovah the Son; in his person for acceptance; in his righteousness for justification; in his blood for pardon; in his fulness for supply; in his power for protection and preservation; and in him alone for salvation and eternal life. Trust in Jehovah the Spirit, to carry on and finish the work of grace upon the heart; of which a saint may be confident that where it is begun it will be completed. And this trust in Father, Son, and Spirit, should be "with all the heart", cordial and sincere. The phrase denotes not so much the strength of faith as the sincerity of it; it signifies a faith unfeigned; it is not saying, or professing, that a man believes and trusts in the Lord; but it is with the heart, and with his whole heart, that he believes unto righteousness, if he believes aright; see <a href="/romans/10-10.htm">Romans 10:10</a>; <p>and lean not unto thine own understanding; or trust not to that; for it stands opposed to trusting in the Lord. Men should not depend upon their own wisdom and understanding, in the conduct of civil life, but should seek the direction and blessing of Providence, or otherwise will meet with disappointment; and, when they succeed, should ascribe it not to their own prudence and wisdom, but to the goodness of God; for "bread" is not always "to the wise, nor riches to men of understanding", <a href="/ecclesiastes/9-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:11</a>; and much less should men lean to their own understanding in matters of religion; a natural man has no understanding of spiritual things, of the things of the Gospel, nor indeed any practical understanding of things moral, <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/3-11.htm">Romans 3:11</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/4-22.htm">Jeremiah 4:22</a>. The understanding of man is darkened by sin; yea, is darkness itself; it is like the first earth, covered with darkness, till light is let into it, and therefore not to be leaned unto and depended on, <a href="/ephesians/4-18.htm">Ephesians 4:18</a>. There is a necessity of a new heart and spirit, of an understanding to be given, in order to understand spiritual and divine things, <a href="/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26</a>; for though these are not contrary to the reason and understanding of men; yet they are above them, and cannot be discovered, reached, comprehended, and accounted for by them, <a href="/matthew/16-17.htm">Matthew 16:17</a>. Nay, there are some things in the Gospel, which, though plain to an enlightened understanding by the word of God, yet the manner how they are cannot be apprehended: as the doctrines of a trinity of Persons; of the generation of the Son of God; the procession of the Spirit; the union of the two natures in Christ; the resurrection of the dead, &amp;c. In short, not our reason and understanding at best, and much less as carnal and unsanctified, but the word of God only is our rule of judgment, and the standard of our faith and practice; and to that we should have recourse and be directed by it, and not lean to our own understandings. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5</span>. <span class="ital">unto</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">upon</span>, R.V. The confidence is to be complete both in degree and in extent: “with <span class="ital">all</span> thy heart,” “in <span class="ital">all</span> thy ways.” This teaching of trust in God, “anticipates,” as the <span class="ital">Speaker’s Commentary</span> points out, the doctrine of faith. <span class="ital">Fides est fiducia</span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Trust in the Lord</span> (<span class="accented">b'takh el y'hovah</span>); literally, <span class="accented">trust in Jehovah.</span> Entire reliance upon Jehovah, implied in the words, "with all thine heart," is here appropriately placed at the head of a series of admonitions which especially have God and man's relations with him in view, inasmuch as such confidence or trust, with its corresponding idea of the renunciation of reliance on self, is, as Zockler truly remarks, a "fundamental principle of all religion." It is the first lesson to be learnt by all, and no less necessary for the Jew than for the Christian. Without this reliance on or confidence in God, it is impossible to carry out any of the precepts of religion. <span class="accented">Batakh</span> is, properly, "to cling to," and so passes to the meaning of "to confide in," "to set one's hope and confidence upon." The preposition <span class="accented">el</span> with <span class="accented">Jehovah</span> indicates the direction which the confidence is to take (cf. <a href="/psalms/37-3.htm">Psalm 37:3, 5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Lean</span> (<span class="accented">tishshaen</span>); Vulgate, <span class="accented">innitaris</span>; followed by <span class="accented">el</span>, like <span class="accented">b'takh</span>, with which it is very similar in meaning. <span class="accented">Shaan</span>, not used in kal, in hiph. signifies "to lean upon, rest upon," just as man rests upon a spear for support. Its metaphorical use, <span class="accented">to repose confidence in</span>, is derived from the practice of kings who were accustomed to appear in public leaning on their friends and ministers; cf. <a href="/2_kings/5-18.htm">2 Kings 5:18</a>; <a href="/2_kings/7-2.htm">2 Kings 7:2, 17</a> (Gesenius). The admonition does not mean that we are not to <span class="accented">use</span> our own understanding (<span class="accented">binab</span>), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> form plans with discretion, and employ legitimate means in the pursuit of our ends; but that, when we use it, we are to depend upon God and his directing and overruling providence (Wardlaw); cf. <a href="/jeremiah/9-23.htm">Jeremiah 9:23, 24</a>.

To the two negative designations of design there follows, as the third and last, a positive one. &#1496;&#1493;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; (contrast to &#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="/proverbs/14-19.htm">Proverbs 14:19</a>) is here used in a general ethical sense: the good (Guten, not Gtigen, the kind). &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;, with the object of the way, may in another connection also mean to keep oneself from, cavere ab (<a href="/psalms/17-4.htm">Psalm 17:4</a>); here it means: carefully to keep in it. The promise of <a href="/proverbs/2-21.htm">Proverbs 2:21</a> is the same as in the Mashal <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/37-9.htm">Psalm 37:9</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/37-11.htm">Psalm 37:11</a>, <a href="/psalms/37-22.htm">Psalm 37:22</a>; cf. <a href="/proverbs/10-30.htm">Proverbs 10:30</a>. &#1488;&#1512;&#1509; is Canaan, or the land which God promised to the patriarchs, and in which He planted Israel, whom He had brought out of Egypt; not the earth, as <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/5-5.htm">Matthew 5:5</a>, according to the extended, unlimited N.T. circle of vision. &#1497;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; (Milel) is erroneously explained by Schultens: funiculis bene firmis irroborabunt in terra. The verb &#1497;&#1514;&#1512;, Arab. watar, signifies to yoke (whence &#1497;&#1514;&#1512;, a cord, rope), then intrans. to be stretched out in length, to be hanging over (vid., Fleischer on <a href="/job/30-11.htm">Job 30:11</a>); whence &#1497;&#1514;&#1512;, residue, <a href="//biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-9.htm">Zephaniah 2:9</a>, and after which the lxx here renders &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, and Jerome permanebunt.

Niph. &#1497;&#1505;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468; is, as at <a href="/proverbs/15-25.htm">Proverbs 15:25</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/52-7.htm">Psalm 52:7</a>, active: evellant; and this, with the subj. remaining indefinite (for which J.

This indefinite "they" or "one" ("man"), Fleischer remarks, can even be used of God, as here and <a href="/job/7-3.htm">Job 7:3</a> - a thing which is common in Persian, where e.g., the expression rendered hominem ex pulvere fecerunt is used instead of the fuller form, which would be rendered homo a Deo ex pulvere factus est. &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1490;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; bears (as &#1489;&#1468;&#1490;&#1491; proves) the primary meaning of concealed, i.e., malicious (treacherous and rapacious, <a href="/isaiah/33-1.htm">Isaiah 33:1</a>), and then faithless men.<p>(Note: Similar is the relation in Arab. of labbasa to liba&#770;s (&#1500;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;); it means to make a thing unknown by covering it; whence telb&#305;&#770;s, deceit, mulebbis, a falsifier.) </body></html>
