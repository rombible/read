The prudence and sobriety which religion teaches, tend not only to the health of the soul, but to the health of the body. Worldly wealth is but poor substance, yet, such as it is, we must honour God with it; and those that do good with what they have, shall have more to do more good with. Should the Lord visit us with trials and sickness, let us not forget that the exhortation speaks to us as to children, for our good. We must not faint under an affliction, be it ever so heavy and long, not be driven to despair, or use wrong means for relief. The father corrects the son whom he loves, because he loves him, and desires that he may be wise and good. Afflictions are so far from doing God's children any hurt, that, by the grace of God, they promote their holiness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Navel - The central region of the body is taken as the representative of all the vital organs.

The sense of the verse is, This wisdom or fear of God is not only useful to the salvation of the soul, but also to the health and welfare of the body, both as it prevents those diseases and distempers which are oft procured by sinful lusts and passions, and as it giveth us an interest in all God’s promises, and putteth us under the care of his special providence. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/proverbs/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>It shall be health to thy navel,.... That part of the body which is the knot of the intestines; and may be put for the bowels and inward parts, which being sound, the body is in health; and these may be put for the whole body: and so the Septuagint version renders it, "to thy body"; and this may be put for the whole person. And the sense is, either wisdom, as Jarchi; the doctrine of wisdom, the Gospel; which teaches men to trust in the Lord, and not in themselves, to apply to him for wisdom, and not lean to their own understanding; this contributes much to a man's spiritual health and welfare: or else the fear of the Lord is of this use to men, both in soul and body; since by it they depart from those sins which bring diseases upon the body; and are influenced by it to the exercise of such graces, and the discharge of such duties, as are the means of keeping the soul in good plight; <p>and marrow to thy bones; or, "watering" (m) to them: that which irrigates and moistens them, and makes and keeps them strong and solid: see <a href="/job/21-24.htm">Job 21:24</a>.

The Targum Jonathan has <span class="accented">medicina</span>, "medicine," as the margin. The root <span class="accented">rapha</span> is properly "to sew together," and the secondary meaning, "to heal," is taken from the healing of a wound by sewing it up. Delitzsch, however, thinks <span class="accented">riph'uth</span> is not to be taken as a restoration from sickness, but as a raising up from enfeebled health, or a confirming of the strength which already exists. There shall be a continuance of health. Gesenius translates "refreshment." <span class="accented">To thy navel</span> (<span class="accented">l'shor'rekha</span>); Vulgate, <span class="accented">umbilico tuo</span>; so Targum Jonathan. <span class="accented">Shor</span> is "the navel," here used synecdochically for the whole body, just as "head" is put for the whole man (<a href="/judges/5-30.htm">Judges 5:30</a>), "mouth" for the whole person speaking (<a href="/proverbs/8-13.htm">Proverbs 8:13</a>), and "slow bellies" for depraved gluttons (<a href="/titus/1-12.htm">Titus 1:12</a>) (Gejerus, Umbreit). The idea is expressed in the LXX., Syriac, and Arabic by "to thy body" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>; <span class="accented">corpori tuo</span>). The navel is here regarded as the centre of vital strength. For the word, see <a href="/songs/7-2.htm">Song of Solomon 7:2</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/16-4.htm">Ezekiel 16:4</a>. This is the only place in the Proverbs where this word is found. Gesenius, however, takes <span class="accented">shor, or l'shor'rekha</span>, as standing col. lectively for the nerves, in which, he says, is the seat of strength, and translates accordingly, "Health (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> refreshment) shall it be to thy nerves." <span class="accented">Marrow</span> (<span class="accented">shik'kuy</span>); literally, <span class="accented">watering</span> or <span class="accented">moistening</span>, as in the margin; Vulgate, <span class="accented">irrigatio.</span> Moistening is imparted to the bones by the marrow, and  thus they are strengthened: "His bones are moistened with marrow" (<a href="/job/21-24.htm">Job 21:24</a>). Where there is an absence of marrow the drying up of the bones ensues, and hence their strength is impaired, and a general debility of the system sets in - they "wax old" (<a href="/psalms/32-3.htm">Psalm 32:3</a>). The effect of a broken spirit is thus described: "A broken spirit drieth up the bones" (<a href="/proverbs/17-22.htm">Proverbs 17:22</a>). The physiological fact here brought forward is borne witness to by Cicero, 'In Tusc.:' "In visceribus atque medullis omne bonum condidisse naturam" (cf. Plato). The meaning of the passage is that, as health to the navel and marrow to the bones stand as representatives of physical strength, so the fear of the Lord, etc., is the spiritual strength of God's children. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>With &#1500;&#1502;&#1506;&#1503; there commences a new section, coordinating itself with the &#1500;&#1492;&#1510;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;&#1498; ("to deliver thee") of <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/2-12.htm">Proverbs 2:12</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/2-16.htm">Proverbs 2:16</a>, unfolding that which wisdom accomplishes as a preserver and guide:<p>20 So that thou walkest in the good way,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And keepest the right paths.<p>21 For the upright shall inhabit the land,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the innocent shall remain in it.<p>22 But the godless are cut off out the land,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the faithless are rooted out of it.<p>Wisdom - thus the connection - will keep thee, so that thou shalt not fall under the seductions of man or of woman; keep, in order that thou... &#1500;&#1502;&#1506;&#1503; (from &#1502;&#1506;&#1503;  equals  &#1502;&#1506;&#1504;&#1492;, tendency, purpose) refers to the intention and object of the protecting wisdom.
