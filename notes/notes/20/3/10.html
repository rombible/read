The prudence and sobriety which religion teaches, tend not only to the health of the soul, but to the health of the body. Worldly wealth is but poor substance, yet, such as it is, we must honour God with it; and those that do good with what they have, shall have more to do more good with. Should the Lord visit us with trials and sickness, let us not forget that the exhortation speaks to us as to children, for our good. We must not faint under an affliction, be it ever so heavy and long, not be driven to despair, or use wrong means for relief. The father corrects the son whom he loves, because he loves him, and desires that he may be wise and good. Afflictions are so far from doing God's children any hurt, that, by the grace of God, they promote their holiness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Compare the marginal reference.

Few persons find it easy to realize that giving away will increase their store (Wardlaw). The teacher is warranted in bringing forward this promise by the language of Moses in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-1.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-8</a>, whine, among other things, he promises that Jehovah will command a blessing upon the "storehouses" and industry of those who honour God. The principle is otherwise expressed in <a href="/proverbs/11-25.htm">Proverbs 11:25</a>, "The liberal soul shall be made fat, and he that watereth shall be also watered himself;" and it is exemplified in <a href="/haggai/1-3.htm">Haggai 1:3-11</a>; <a href="/haggai/2-15.htm">Haggai 2:15, 19</a>; <a href="/malachi/3-10.htm">Malachi 3:10-12</a>, and in the New Testament in <a href="/philippians/4-14.htm">Philippians 4:14-19</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/9-6.htm">2 Corinthians 9:6-8</a>. <span class="accented">Thy barns</span>; <span class="accented">asameykha</span>, the only form in which <span class="accented">asam</span>, "a storehouse," "barn," or "granary," occurs.

The word here translated "presses" is, strictly speaking," vats" or "reservoirs," into which the must from the wine press flowed.

He obtains favour in the eyes of God and man, to whom favour on both sides is shown; he obtains refined prudence, to whom it is on both sides adjudicated. It is unnecessary, with Ewald and Hitzig, to assign the two objects to God and men. In the eyes of both at the same time, he who carries love and faithfulness in his heart appears as one to whom &#1495;&#1503; and &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1500; &#1496;&#1493;&#1489; must be adjudicated. </body></html>
