Vulgate, <span class="accented">si dormieris</span>; cf. <a href="/proverbs/6-22.htm">Proverbs 6:22</a>, "when thou sleepest" <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5da;</span>, <span class="accented">b'shok'b'ka</span>).

The parallel &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501; is not a genitive to &#1504;&#1514;&#1497;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; to be supplied; that paths of Wisdom are themselves &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501;, for she brings well-being on all sides and deep inwards satisfaction (peace). In regard to &#1504;&#1514;&#1497;&#1489;&#1492;, via eminens, elata, Schultens is right (vid., under <a href="/proverbs/1-15.htm">Proverbs 1:15</a>);<p>(Note: The root is not &#1514;&#1489;, to grope, but &#1504;&#1514;; whence Arab. natt, to bubble up, nata&#770;, to raise oneself, to swell up, etc.)<p>&#1504;&#1514;&#1497;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1492; has Munach, and instead of the Metheg, Tarcha, vid., under <a href="/proverbs/1-31.htm">Proverbs 1:31</a>. The figure of the tree of life the fruit of which brings immortality, is, as <a href="/proverbs/11-30.htm">Proverbs 11:30</a>; <a href="/proverbs/15-4.htm">Proverbs 15:4</a> (cf. <a href="/proverbs/13-12.htm">Proverbs 13:12</a>), <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/2-7.htm">Revelation 2:7</a>, taken from the history of paradise in the Book of Genesis. The old ecclesiastical saying, Lignum vitae crux Christi, accommodates itself in a certain measure, through <a href="/matthew/11-19.htm">Matthew 11:19</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/11-49.htm">Luke 11:49</a>, with this passage of the Book of Proverbs. &#1492;&#1495;&#1494;&#1497;&#1511; &#1489; means to fasten upon anything, more fully expressed in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/21-18.htm">Genesis 21:18</a>, to bind the hand firm with anything, to seize it firmly. They who give themselves to Wisdom, come to experience that she is a tree of life whose fruit contains and communicates strength of life, and whoever always keeps fast hold of Wisdom is blessed, i.e., to be pronounced happy (<a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/41-3.htm">Psalm 41:3</a>, vid., under <a href="/psalms/137-8.htm">Psalm 137:8</a>). The predicate &#1502;&#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1512;, blessed, refers to each one of the &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1499;&#1497;&#1492;, those who hold her, cf. <a href="/proverbs/27-16.htm">Proverbs 27:16</a>; <a href="/numbers/24-9.htm">Numbers 24:9</a>. It is the so-called distributive singular of the predicate, which is freely used particularly in those cases where the plur. of the subject is a participle (vid., under <a href="/proverbs/3-35.htm">Proverbs 3:35</a>). </body></html>
