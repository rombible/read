Let not mercy and truth forsake thee; God's mercy in promising, and his truth in performing: live up to them, keep up thine interest in them, and take the comfort of them. We must trust in the Lord with all our hearts, believing he is able and wise to do what is best. Those who know themselves, find their own understandings a broken reed, which, if they lean upon, will fail. Do not design any thing but what is lawful, and beg God to direct thee in every case, though it may seem quite plain. In all our ways that prove pleasant, in which we gain our point, we must acknowledge God with thankfulness. In all our ways that prove uncomfortable, and that are hedged up with thorns, we must acknowledge him with submission.

This construction, where two imperatives are joined, the former containing an exhortation or admonition, the second a promise made on the condition implied in the first, and the second imperative being used as a future, occurs again in <a href="/proverbs/4-4.htm">Proverbs 4:4</a>; <a href="/proverbs/7-2.htm">Proverbs 7:2</a>, "Keep my commandments, and live;" 9:6, "Forsake the foolish, and live;" 20:13, "Open thine eyes, and thou shalt be satisfied with bread" (cf. <a href="/genesis/42-18.htm">Genesis 42:18</a>; <a href="/psalms/37-27.htm">Psalm 37:27</a>; <a href="/job/22-21.htm">Job 22:21</a>; <a href="/isaiah/36-16.htm">Isaiah 36:16</a>; <a href="/hosea/10-12.htm">Hosea 10:12</a>; <a href="/amos/5-4.htm">Amos 5:4-6</a>; Gesenius, &sect; 130, 2). Delitzsch calls this "an admonitory imperative;" Bottcher, "the desponsive imperative."

For the expression, "to find favour" (<span class="accented">matsa khen</span>), see <a href="/genesis/6-8.htm">Genesis 6:8</a>; <a href="/exodus/33-12.htm">Exodus 33:12</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/31-2.htm">Jeremiah 31:2</a>; comp. <a href="/luke/1-30.htm">Luke 1:30</a>, <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1fe6;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1ff7;</span>."

So Delitzsch, Bertheau, Kamph. A true sagacity, prudence, or penetrating judgment will be adjudicated by God and man to him who possesses the internal excellence of love and truth. The Hebrew <span class="accented">sekel is</span> derived from <span class="accented">sakal</span>, "to act wisely or prudently," and has this intellectual meaning in <a href="/proverbs/13-15.htm">Proverbs 13:15</a>; <a href="/psalms/111-10.htm">Psalm 111:10</a> (see also <a href="/1_samuel/25-3.htm">1 Samuel 25:3</a> and <a href="/2_chronicles/30-22.htm">2 Chronicles 30:22</a>). The Targum Jonathan reads, <span class="accented">intellectus et benignitas</span>, thus throwing the adjective into a substantival form; the Syriac, <span class="accented">intellectus</span> simply. Ewald, Hitzig, Zockler, and others, on the other hand, understand <span class="accented">sekel</span> as referring to the judgment formed of any one, the favourable opinion or view which is entertained of hint by others, and hence take it as <span class="accented">reputation</span>, or estimation. The man who has love and truth will be held in high esteem by God and man. Our objection to this rendering is that it does not seem to advance the meaning of the passage beyond that of "favour." Another, mentioned by Delitzsch, is that <span class="accented">sekel</span> is never used in any other sense than that of <span class="accented">intellectus</span> in the Mishle. The marginal reading, "good success," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> prosperity, seems inadmissible here, as the hiph. <span class="accented">has'kil</span>, "to cause to prosper," as in <a href="/proverbs/17-8.htm">Proverbs 17:8</a>; <a href="/joshua/1-7.htm">Joshua 1:7</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/29-9.htm">Deuteronomy 29:9</a>, does not apply in this instance any more than in <a href="/psalms/111-10.htm">Psalm 111:10</a>, margin. <span class="cmt_word">In the sight of God and man</span> (<span class="accented">b'eyney elohim v'adam</span>); literally, <span class="accented">in the eyes of Elohim and man</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> according to the judgment of God and man (Zockler); Vulgate<span class="accented">, coram Deo et hominibus.</span> A simpler form of this phrase is found in <a href="/1_samuel/2-26.htm">1 Samuel 2:26</a>, where Samuel is said to have found favour with the Lord, and also with men. So in <a href="/luke/2-52.htm">Luke 2:52</a> Jesus found favour "with God and man (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>)" (comp. <a href="/genesis/10-9.htm">Genesis 10:9</a>; <a href="/acts/2-47.htm">Acts 2:47</a>, <a href="/romans/14-18.htm">Romans 14:18</a>). The two conditions of favor and sagacity, or prudence, are not to be assigned respectively to God and man (as Ewald and Hitzig), or that finding favour has reference more to God, and being deemed prudent refers more to man. The statement is universal. Both these conditions will be adjudged to the man who has mercy and truth by God in heaven and man on earth at the same time (see Delitszch). The LXX., "after favour," instead of the text, reads, "and provide good things in the sight of the Lord and men," quoted by St. Paul (<a href="/2_corinthians/8-21.htm">2 Corinthians 8:21</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>With &#1500;&#1502;&#1506;&#1503; there commences a new section, coordinating itself with the &#1500;&#1492;&#1510;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;&#1498; ("to deliver thee") of <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/2-12.htm">Proverbs 2:12</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/2-16.htm">Proverbs 2:16</a>, unfolding that which wisdom accomplishes as a preserver and guide:<p>20 So that thou walkest in the good way,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And keepest the right paths.<p>21 For the upright shall inhabit the land,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the innocent shall remain in it.<p>22 But the godless are cut off out the land,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the faithless are rooted out of it.<p>Wisdom - thus the connection - will keep thee, so that thou shalt not fall under the seductions of man or of woman; keep, in order that thou... &#1500;&#1502;&#1506;&#1503; (from &#1502;&#1506;&#1503;  equals  &#1502;&#1506;&#1504;&#1492;, tendency, purpose) refers to the intention and object of the protecting wisdom.
