We must make wisdom our business; we must venture all in it, and be willing to part with all for it. This Wisdom is the Lord Jesus Christ and his salvation, sought and obtained by faith and prayer. Were it not for unbelief, remaining sinfulness, and carelessness, we should find all our ways pleasantness, and our paths peace, for his are so; but we too often step aside from them, to our own hurt and grief. Christ is that Wisdom, by whom the worlds were made, and still are in being; happy are those to whom he is made of God wisdom.

Wisdom, the creative power of God, exhibited as the protection of those who fear God</span>. The teacher in this discourse presents Wisdom under a new aspect. Wisdom is the Divine power of God, by which he created the world, and by which he sustains the work of his hands and regulates the operations of nature. This eminence of Wisdom, in her intimate association with Jehovah, is made the basis of a renewed exhortation to keep Wisdom steadily in view. The elevated thought that Wisdom has her source in Jehovah might seem in itself an adequate and sufficient reason for the exhortation. But another motive is adduced intimately bound up with this view of Wisdom. Jehovah becomes the ground of confidence and the protection in all conditions of life of those who keep Wisdom. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord by wisdom hath founded the earth.</span> The emphatic position of the word <span class="accented">Jehovah</span>, "the Lord," at the beginning of the sentence (cf. <a href="/psalms/27.htm">Psalm 27</a>; <a href="/psalms/97.htm">Psalm 97</a>; <a href="/psalms/99.htm">Psalm 99</a>), as well as the nature of the discourse, indicates a new paragraph. The description of the creative Wisdom of Jehovah may have been suggested to the mind of the teacher by the mention of the tree of life, in ver. 18 (Zockler); but the connection between this and the preceding passage has to be sought for in something deeper. The scope of the teacher is to exhibit, and so to recommend, Wisdom in every respect, and after showing her excellence in man, he now  brings her forward as the medium of creation, and hence in her relation to God. <span class="accented">By wisdom</span> (<span class="accented">b'kokhmah</span>); Vulgate, <span class="accented">sapientia</span>; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span>. It is evident that Wisdom is here something more than an attribute of Jehovah. "By Wisdom" means "by, or through, the instrumentality of Wisdom." While the corresponding and parallel expressions, "understanding," "knowledge," militate against the idea of an hypostatizing of Wisdom, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> assigning to Wisdom a concrete and objective personality, yet the language is sufficiently strong, when we connect this passage with ch. 1. and 8, to warrant our regarding Wisdom as something apart from yet intimately connected with Jehovah, as an active agency employed by him, and hence this description may. be looked upon as an anticipation of that which is more fully developed in ch. 8, where the characteristics which are wanting here are there worked out at length. The rabbins evidently connected the passage before us, as well as ch. 1 and 8, with <a href="/genesis/1-1.htm">Genesis 1:1</a>, by rendering <span class="accented">b'reshith</span>, "in the beginning." by <span class="accented">b'kokhmah</span>, "by Wisdom." Our Lord identifies himself with the Divine Sophia, or Wisdom (<a href="/luke/11-49.htm">Luke 11:49</a>). And the language of St. John, "All things were made by him, and without him was not anything made that was made" (<a href="/john/1-3.htm">John 1:3</a>), which assigns to the Logos, or Word of God, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Christ, the act of creation (cf. <a href="/john/1-10.htm">John 1:10</a>, and especially the language of St. Paul, in <a href="/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16</a>), argues in favour of the view of some commentators who understand Wisdom to refer to the Second Person of the Trinity. The Logos was understood by Alexandrian Judaism to express the <span class="accented">manifestation</span> of the unseen God, the Absolute Being, in the creation and government of the world; and the Christian teachers, when they adopted this term, assigned to it a concrete meaning as indicating the Incarnate Word (see Bishop Lightfoot, in <a href="/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a>). For the passage, see <a href="/psalms/33-6.htm">Psalm 33:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/104-24.htm">Psalm 104:24</a>; <a href="/psalms/136-5.htm">Psalm 136:5</a>; and especially <a href="/jeremiah/10-12.htm">Jeremiah 10:12</a>, "He hath established the world by his wisdom," etc.; Jeremiah 51:55; Ecclus. 24:2, <span class="accented">seq.

While the primary meaning of <span class="accented">yasad</span> is "to give fixity to," "to lay fast," that of <span class="accented">konen</span>, rendered "he hath established," is "to set up," "to erect," and so "to <span class="accented">found</span>," from <span class="accented">kun</span>, or referring to the Arabic and Ethiopic cognate root, "to exist," "to give existence to." The marginal reading, "prepared," corresponds with the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>. The Vulgate is <span class="accented">stabilivit</span>, "he hath established." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Such submission to God, the All-wise, the All-directing, who loves us with fatherly affection, is wisdom, and such wisdom is above all treasures.<p>13 Blessed is the man who has found wisdom,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the man who has gained understanding;<p>14 For better is her acquisition than the acquisition of silver,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And her gain than fine gold.<p>15 More precious is she than corals;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And all thy jewels do not equal her value.<p>The imperfect &#1497;&#1508;&#1497;&#1511;, which as the Hiph. of &#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511;, exire, has the general meaning educere, interchanges with the perfect &#1502;&#1510;&#1488;. This bringing forth is either a delivering up, i.e., giving out or presenting, <a href="/isaiah/58-10.htm">Isaiah 58:10</a>; <a href="/psalms/140-9.htm">Psalm 140:9</a>; <a href="/psalms/144-13.htm">Psalm 144:13</a> (cf. &#1504;&#1508;&#1511;, Arab. nafak&#803;, to give out, to pay out), or a fetching out, getting out, receiving, <a href="/proverbs/8-35.htm">Proverbs 8:35</a>; <a href="/proverbs/12-2.htm">Proverbs 12:2</a>; <a href="/proverbs/18-22.htm">Proverbs 18:22</a>. Thus 13a reminds one of the parable of the treasure in the field, and 13b of that of the goodly pearl for which the &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; who sought the pearl parted with all that he had. Here also is declared the promise of him who trades with a merchant for the possession of wisdom; for &#1505;&#1495;&#1512;&#1492;&#1468; and &#1505;&#1495;&#1512; (both, as <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/23-3.htm">Isaiah 23:3</a>, <a href="/isaiah/23-18.htm">Isaiah 23:18</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/45-15.htm">Isaiah 45:15</a>, from &#1505;&#1495;&#1512;, the latter after the forms &#1494;&#1512;&#1506;, &#1504;&#1496;&#1506;, without our needing to assume a second primary form, &#1505;&#1495;&#1512;) go back to the root-word &#1505;&#1495;&#1512;, to trade, go about as a trader, with the fundamental meaning &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; (lxx); and also the mention of the pearls is not wanting here, for at all events the meaning "pearls" has blended itself with &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, which is a favourite word in the Mashal poetry, though it be not the original meaning of the word. In 14b &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1507; is surpassed by &#1495;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509; (besides in the Proverbs, found only in this meaning in <a href="/psalms/68-14.htm">Psalm 68:14</a>), which properly means ore found in a mine, from &#1495;&#1512;&#1509;, to cut in, to dig up, and hence the poetic name of gold, perhaps of gold dug out as distinguished from molten gold. Hitzig regards &#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; as identical with it; but this word (Sanskr. without the ending hir, Zench. zar) is derived from ghar, to glitter (vid., Curtius). &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514;&#1492;&#1468; we have translated "gain," for it does not mean the profit which wisdom brings, the tribute which it yields, but the gain, the possession of wisdom herself.</body></html>
