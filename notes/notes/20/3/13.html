We must make wisdom our business; we must venture all in it, and be willing to part with all for it. This Wisdom is the Lord Jesus Christ and his salvation, sought and obtained by faith and prayer. Were it not for unbelief, remaining sinfulness, and carelessness, we should find all our ways pleasantness, and our paths peace, for his are so; but we too often step aside from them, to our own hurt and grief. Christ is that Wisdom, by whom the worlds were made, and still are in being; happy are those to whom he is made of God wisdom.

Some connect these words with the preceding; as if the sense was, a good man, though he is chastened by the Lord, yet is a happy man; not only because his chastenings are in love and for good, but because he improves in spiritual knowledge and understanding by them; see <a href="/psalms/94-12.htm">Psalm 94:12</a>. Aben Ezra connects them with the former, but in a different manner, thus; "happy is the man that findeth wisdom", for by it he keeps from sinning, that chastisements may not come upon him. But rather the argument in praise of wisdom, and the advantages of it, insisted on in the preceding chapter, is resumed here and enlarged upon; and by wisdom is meant Christ, and a saving knowledge of him by means of his Gospel; and "finding" him supposes seeking him; which does not arise from nature, but the grace of God, and follows upon the sight of the need and worth of Christ; and is done in the use of means, as reading, praying, and attendance on the word and ordinances: and finding him is no other than an enjoyment of him by faith; which is a seeing him, a taking hold on him, and possessing him; who is to be found in the covenant of grace, being the Mediator, surety, and messenger of it; in the Gospel, which is full of him; in the promises of it, which hold him forth, and the blessings of his grace; in the ordinances, which direct unto him, and where he shows himself: for he is not to be found by the light of nature, nor by carnal reason, nor by the law of Moses; but by means of the Gospel, attended with the Spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him; and a happy finding this, which fills the possessor with inexpressible joy! see <a href="/john/1-41.htm">John 1:41</a>; <p>and the man that getteth understanding; Christ, and a spiritual understanding of him: this is not a proper acquisition of a man's own; an interest in Christ is not gotten by anything of man's; not by his good works, which are the fruits of grace; nor by faith and repentance, which are gifts of grace themselves; but it is given unto a man: and "getting" here signifies, as before, possession and enjoyment of Christ, as God's pure gift; as a man that is said to obtain the favour of God, when he enjoys it, and the effects of it, in consequence of finding Christ, <a href="/proverbs/8-35.htm">Proverbs 8:35</a>; where the same word is used as here. The word signifies to "draw out" (t); as metals are drawn out of the earth by searching and digging for, or as water out of a well; thus Christ, and the knowledge of him, are drawn out of the mines and fountains of the Scriptures, by such that seek after him aright. Aben Ezra interprets it, that draws or brings it out from another, and learns it; the true believer in Christ hears and learns of the Father, and so comes to Christ, and enjoys him, <a href="/john/6-45.htm">John 6:45</a>. The Targum is, <p>"who causes understanding to spring up;'' <p>as water out of a well or fountain; out of his heart, as Gersom; or, as Jarchi, who has learned wisdom, that it is ready to break out, at his mouth; out of the abundance of it in his heart, his mouth speaketh; as such that know Christ cannot but speak to others of the things they have heard and seen, <a href="/matthew/12-34.htm">Matthew 12:34</a>. <p>(t) "educet", Montanus; "eruit", Tigurine version, Vatablus. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth understanding.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">13</span>. <span class="ital">getteth</span>] Lit. <span class="bld">draweth forth</span>, or <span class="bld">out</span>, R.V. and A.V. marg.

In doing so, he reverts to his main subject, which is Wisdom, or the fear of the Lord (see ver. 7 and <a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>), and pronounces a panegyric upon her, comparing her, as in <a href="/job/28.htm">Job 28</a>, with treasures whose value she exceeds, and showing wherein that value consists, viz. in the gifts which she confers on man. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Happy is the man</span> (<span class="accented">ash'rey adam</span>); literally, <span class="accented">blessings of the man.</span> The plural of "excellence" used here, as in <a href="/job/5-17.htm">Job 5:17</a>, to raise the sense. The man who has found Wisdom is supremely blessed. Beds connects this blessedness immediately with God's chastisements in the preceding verse. So Delitzsch. <span class="cmt_word">That findeth</span> (<span class="accented">matsa</span>); properly, <span class="accented">hath found.</span> "The perfect expresses permanent possession, just as the imperfect, <span class="accented">yaphik</span>, denotes a continually renewed and repeated attaining" (Zockler). The Vulgate also uses the perfect, <span class="accented">invenit</span>, "hath found;" LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3cb;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;</span>, "who found" - the aorist. <span class="cmt_word">The man that getteth understanding</span> (<span class="accented">adam yaphik t'vunah</span>); literally, <span class="accented">the man that draweth out understanding</span>, as in the margin. <span class="accented">Yaphik</span> is the hiph. future or imperfect of <span class="accented">puk</span>, the primary meaning of which is <span class="accented">educere</span>, "to draw out," "to bring forth." This verb is used in two widely different senses. In the first place, it is equivalent to "bring forth" or "draw out" in the sense of <span class="accented">imparting</span>, as in <a href="/isaiah/58-10.htm">Isaiah 58:10</a>, "If thou <span class="accented">draw out</span> thy soul to the hungry," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> impart benefits to them; and <a href="/psalms/145-13.htm">Psalm 145:13</a>, "That our garners may be full, <span class="accented">affording</span> all manner of store," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> yielding, giving out, presenting for our benefit. Its second sense is that of attaining, drawing out from another for one's own use. In this sense it occurs in <a href="/proverbs/8-35.htm">Proverbs 8:35</a>; <a href="/proverbs/12-2.htm">Proverbs 12:2</a>; <a href="/proverbs/18-22.htm">Proverbs 18:22</a>, where it is rendered "obtain." The latter sense is the one that suits the present passage, and best agrees with the corresponding <span class="accented">matsa.</span> The man is blessed who draws forth, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> obtains, understanding from God for himself. The Vulgate renders, <span class="accented">qui affluit prudentia</span>, "who overflows with understanding," or, has understanding in abundance; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;</span>, equivalent to "who saw." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Were "kindness and truth" (<a href="/proverbs/3-3.htm">Proverbs 3:3</a>) understood only in relation to men, then the following admonition would not be interposed, since it proceeds from that going before, if there the quality of kindness and truth, not only towards man, but also towards God, is commended:<p>5 Trust in Jahve with thy whole heart,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; And lean not on thine own understanding.<p>6 In all thy ways acknowledge Him,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; And He will make plain thy paths.<p>7 Be not wise in thine own eyes;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Fear Jahve, and depart from evil.<p>8 Health will then come to thy navel,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; And refreshing to thy bones.<p>From God alone comes true prosperity, true help. He knows the right way to the right ends. He knows what benefits us. He is able to free us from that which does us harm: therefore it is our duty and our safety to place our confidence wholly in Him, and to trust not to our own judgment. The verb &#1489;&#1468;&#1496;&#1495;, Arab. bat&#803;h&#803;, has the root-meaning expandere, whence perhaps, by a more direct way than that noted under <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/4-6.htm">Psalm 4:6</a>, it acquires the meaning confidere, to lean with the whole body on something, in order to rest upon it, strengthened by &#1506;&#1500;, if one lean wholly - Fr. se reposer sur quelqu'un; Ital. riposarsi sopra alcuno, - like &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1506;&#1503; with &#1488;&#1500;, to lean on anything, so as to be supported by it; with &#1506;&#1500;, to support oneself on anything (Fl.). &#1491;&#1506;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; (the same in form as &#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;, <a href="/numbers/11-12.htm">Numbers 11:12</a>) is not fully represented by "acknowledge Him;" as in <a href="/1_chronicles/28-9.htm">1 Chronicles 28:9</a> it is not a mere theoretic acknowledgment that is meant, but earnest penetrating cognizance, engaging the whole man. The practico-mystical &#1491;&#1506;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;, in and of itself full of significance, according to O. and N.T. usage, is yet strengthened by toto corde. The heart is the central seat of all spiritual soul-strength; to love God with the whole heart is to concentrate the whole inner life on the active contemplation of God, and the ready observance of His will. God requites such as show regard to Him, by making plain their path before them, i.e., by leading them directly to the right end, removing all hindrances out of their way. &#1488;&#1512;&#1495;&#1514;&#1497;&#1498; has Cholem in the first syllable (vid., Kimchi's Lex.).<p>(Note: In the st. constr. <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/2-19.htm">Proverbs 2:19</a>, and with the grave suff. <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/2-15.htm">Proverbs 2:15</a>, o&#780; instead of o&#772; is in order; but Ben-Asher's &#1488;&#1512;&#1495;&#1514;&#1497;, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/13-27.htm">Job 13:27</a>, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/job/33-11.htm">Job 33:11</a>, is an inconsistency.)<p>"Be not wise in thine own eyes" is equivalent to ne tibi sapiens videare; for, as J. H. Michaelis remarks, confidere Deo est sapere, sibi vero ac suae sapientiae, desipere. "Fear God and depart from evil" is the twofold representation of the &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;, or practical piety, in the Chokma writings: <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/16-6.htm">Proverbs 16:6</a>, the Mashal <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/34-10.htm">Psalm 34:10</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/34-15.htm">Psalm 34:15</a>, and <a href="/job/28-28.htm">Job 28:28</a> cf. <a href="/proverbs/1-2.htm">Proverbs 1:2</a>. For &#1505;&#1512; &#1502;&#1512;&#1506;, the post-biblical expression is &#1497;&#1512;&#1488; &#1495;&#1496;&#1488;.</body></html>
