A good man is not liable to uneasiness in contriving what he shall do, or in reflecting on what he has done, as those who walk in deceit. And his family fare better for his sake. 8. If great men are good men, they may do much good, and prevent very much evil. 9. Some can say, Through grace, we are cleaner than we have been; but it was the work of the Holy Spirit. 10. See the various deceits men use, of which the love of money is the root. The Lord will not bless what is thus gotten. 11. Parents should observe their children, that they may manage them accordingly. 12. All our powers and faculties are from God, and are to be employed for him. 13. Those that indulge themselves, may expect to want necessaries, which should have been gotten by honest labour. 14. Men use arts to get a good bargain, and to buy cheap; whereas a man ought to be ashamed of a fraud and a lie. 15. He that prefers true knowledge to riches, follows the ways of religion and happiness. If we really believed this truth, the word of God would be valued as it deserves, and the world would lose its tempting influence. 16. Those ruin themselves who entangle themselves in rash suretiship. Also those who are in league with abandoned women. Place no confidence in either. 17. Wealth gotten by fraud may be sweet, for the carnal mind takes pleasure in the success of wicked devices; but it will be bitter in the reflection. 18. Especially we need advice in spiritual warfare. The word and Spirit of God are the best counsellors in every point. 19. Those dearly buy their own praise, who put confidence in a man because he speaks fairly. 20. An undutiful child will become very miserable. Never let him expect any peace or comfort. 21. An estate suddenly raised, is often as suddenly ruined. 22. Wait on the Lord, attend his pleasure, and he will protect thee.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Not only do we owe the gifts of sight and hearing to Yahweh, but He, being the giver, will also call us to account for them (compare <a href="/psalms/94-9.htm">Psalm 94:9</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/20.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12.

He names <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">the eye</span> and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">ear, </span> because these are the two senses by which instructions are conveyed to <span class="ital">the mind</span>; but under them he seems to comprehend all other senses and powers of soul or body, by a synecdoche. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/proverbs/20.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>The hearing ear, and the seeing eye,.... There may be an ear that hears not, and an eye that seeth not, and which men may make; the painter can paint an ear and an eye, and a carver can carve both; but they are ears that hear not, and eyes that see not, <a href="/psalms/115-5.htm">Psalm 115:5</a>; but such as can hear and see are of the Lord's own make; <p>the Lord hath made even both of them; they are the effects of his wisdom, power, and goodness; see <a href="/exodus/4-11.htm">Exodus 4:11</a>; they are both senses of excellent use and service; great mercies and blessings of life, for which men should be abundantly thankful, and pray for the continuance of, and make use of to the best purposes; they are means of conveying much knowledge to the mind, and by which it may be cultivated and improved in it. The words may be considered in a figurative as well as a literal sense. Some by "the seeing eye" understand the civil magistrate, who is that to the body politic as the eyes are to the natural body, eminent in it, overlook it, watch and provide for its good, and against its hurt; see <a href="/numbers/10-31.htm">Numbers 10:31</a>; and by "the hearing ear" the obedient subject, that hearkens to the laws and directions of his governors, and cheerfully obeys them, and both these are of the Lord's making; civil magistracy is his ordinance, and civil magistrates are ordained by him; and from him they have their qualifications fitting them for their office; and it is owing to the overruling providence of God on the hearts of men that they are inclined to yield subjection to them. Others think that by the "seeing eye" are meant the ministers of the word, who are set in the highest place in the church; whose business it is to inspect, take the oversight of, and watch the souls of men; to pry and search into the truths of the Gospel, and show them to others: and by the "hearing ear" the hearers of the word, that receive it readily in the love of it, and heartily obey it. I am rather of opinion that one and the same sort of persons are intended; converted ones, who have the "hearing ear", who try what they hear by the word of God; understand what they hear, know it experimentally; can distinguish truth from error, approve and love the Gospel, receive it with all gladness and readiness, with eagerness and pleasure; keep it when they have it, and practise what they hear, and bring forth fruit to the glory of God: this they have not of themselves, being naturally averse to and dull of hearing, and even stop their ears to the truth; but it comes by the word, and is the Lord's work, and owing to his mighty power, who opens their ears, gives them new ears, which they have in regeneration; when they hear spiritually, profitably, pleasantly, comfortably, and to their great astonishment: these also have the "seeing eye", a sight of themselves, their sinful and lost estate; of the plague of their own hearts, their want of righteousness, and impotence to do anything that is good; a sight of Christ, of the loveliness of his person, of the fulness of his grace, of their need of him, and of his suitableness as a Saviour and Redeemer; and this is not of themselves, who are dark and darkness itself, but they are made light in the Lord; he opens their eyes by his spirit and by means of his word, which is a work of almighty power. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/20.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, the LORD hath made even both of them.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/20.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">12</span>. <span class="ital">The hearing ear</span>] or, <span class="ital">The ear heareth, and the eye seeth</span>. <span class="greekheb">Οὖς ἀκούει καὶ ὀφθαλμὸς ὁρᾷ</span>, LXX.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The proverb is designed to be a seed of thought and to suggest many inferences, such as: How great must the Maker of such organs be (<a href="/psalms/139-14.htm" title="I will praise you; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: marvelous are your works; and that my soul knows right well.">Psalm 139:14</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/13-5.htm" title="For by the greatness and beauty of the creatures proportionably the maker of them is seen.">Wis 13:5</a>); how exactly must their Maker take account of their use (<a href="/psalms/94-9.htm" title="He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? he that formed the eye, shall he not see?">Psalm 94:9</a>); how entirely dependent are we upon Him for their employment (<a href="/exodus/4-11.htm" title="And the LORD said to him, Who has made man's mouth? or who makes the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? have not I the LORD?">Exodus 4:11</a>) or restoration (<a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm" title="Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped.">Isaiah 35:5</a>), whether literally or spiritually.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, the Lord hath made even both of them.</span> This apothegm, which seems to be nothing but a trite truism, brings to notice many important consequences. First, there is the result noted in <a href="/psalms/94-9.htm">Psalm 94:9</a>, "He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? He that formed the eye, shall he not see?" Hence we learn the sleepless providence of God. So 'Pirke Aboth,' "Know that which is above thee, an eye that seeth all, an ear that heareth all." We learn also that all things are directed and overruled by God (comp. <a href="/proverbs/15-3.htm">Proverbs 15:3</a>; <a href="/proverbs/16-4.htm">Proverbs 16:4</a>). Then there is the thought that these powers of ours, being the gift of God, should be used piously and in God's service. "Mine ears hast thou opened...  Lo, I come...  I delight to do thy will, O my God" (<a href="/psalms/40-6.htm">Psalm 40:6</a>, etc.). The eye should be blind, the ear deaf, to all that might defile or excite to evil (see <a href="/isaiah/33-15.htm">Isaiah 33:15</a>). But it is the Lord alone that enables the spiritual organs to receive the wondrous things of God's Law; they must be educated by grace to enable them to perform their proper functions. "God hath given us eyes," says St. Chrysostom ('Hom. 22 in 1 Corinthians'), "not that we may look wantonly, but that, admiring his handiwork, we may worship the Creator. And that this is the use of our eyes is evident from the things which are seen. For the lustre of the sun and of the sky we see from an immeasurable distances, but a woman's beauty one cannot discern so far off. Seest thou that for this end our eye was chiefly given? Again, he made the ear, that we should entertain not blasphemous words, but saving doctrines. Wherefore you see, when it receives anything dissonant, both our soul shudders and our very body also. And if we hear anything cruel or merciless, again our flesh creeps; but if anything decorous and kind, we even exult and rejoice." "He that hath ears to hear, let him hear." Septuagint, "The ear heareth and the eye sooth, and both are the works of the Lord." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/20.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>6 Almost every one meeteth a man who is gracious to him;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; But a man who standeth the test, who findeth such a one?<p>As &#1510;&#1497;&#1512; &#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/13-17.htm">Proverbs 13:17</a>, signifies a messenger in whom there is confidence, and &#1506;&#1491; &#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/14-5.htm">Proverbs 14:5</a>, a witness who is altogether truthful, so &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; is a man who remains true to himself, and maintains fidelity toward others. Such an one it is not easy to find; but patrons who make promises and awaken expectations, finally to leave in the lurch him who depends on them - of such there are many. This contrast would proceed from 6a also, if we took &#1511;&#1512;&#1488; in the sense of to call, to call or cry out with ostentation: multi homines sunt quorum suam quisque humanitatem proclamat (Schelling, Fleischer, Ewald, Zckler, and also, e.g., Meri). But &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1495;&#1505;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493; is certainly to be interpreted after <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/11-17.htm">Proverbs 11:17</a>, <a href="/isaiah/57-1.htm">Isaiah 57:1</a>. Recognising this, Hitzig translates: many a man one names his dear friend; but in point of style this would be as unsuitable as possible. Must &#1497;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488; then mean vocat? A more appropriate parallel word to &#1502;&#1510;&#1488; is &#1511;&#1512;&#1488;  equals  &#1511;&#1512;&#1492;, according to which, with Oetinger, Heidenheim, Euchel, and Lwenstein, we explain: the greater part of men meet one who shows himself to them (to this or that man) as &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1495;&#1505;&#1491;, a man well-affectioned and benevolent; but it is rare to find one who in his affection and its fruits proves himself to be true, and actually performs that which was hoped for from him. Luther translates, with the Syr. and Targ. after Jerome: Viel Menschen werden From gerhmbt [many men are reputed pious]; but if &#1497;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488; were equivalent to &#1497;&#1511;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;, then &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1495;&#1505;&#1491; ought to have been used instead of &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1495;&#1505;&#1491;&#1493;. The lxx read &#1512;&#1489; &#1488;&#1491;&#1501; &#1497;&#1511;&#1512; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1495;&#1505;&#1491;, man is something great, and a compassionate man is something precious; but it costs trouble to find out a true man. The fundamental thought remains almost the same in all these interpretations and readings: love is plentiful; fidelity, rare; therefore &#1495;&#1505;&#1491;, of the right kind, after the image of God, is joined to &#1488;&#1502;&#1514;. </body></html>
