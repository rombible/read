Rubs it off and scours it away, as the word (m) signifies, or is a clearing and rubbing it off; some men must be beaten black and blue, or must have very sore correction, before they can be reclaimed and reformed from their evil ways; so some interpret it of the evil man (n): sanctified afflictions to God's people are the means of purging away their iniquities, their dross, and their sin; but there is nothing so effectually cleanses from sin as the blood of Jesus, or heals or cures of it as his blue wounds and stripes; see <a href="/isaiah/27-9.htm">Isaiah 27:9</a>; <p>so do stripes the inward part of the belly; or heart and conscience; by means of corrections and chastisement men are brought to an inward sense of sin; they are shown their transgressions wherein they have exceeded, and are commanded to return from iniquity, <a href="/job/36-9.htm">Job 36:9</a>; they lament and mourn over sin, confess it and forsake it; and then may the inwards of the heart, the mind and conscience, defiled with them, be said to be cleansed from them; especially when led by these stripes and corrections to the stripes, wounds, and blood of Christ which, being applied, cleanse from all, sin inwardly and outwardly. <p>(m) "abstesio", Piscator, Mercerus, Cocceius; "detersio", Montanus, Michaelis; "effricatio", Schultens.

Aben Ezra connects this verse with the preceding thus: as strength gives a glory to young men, and hoar hairs adorn an old man, so wounds and bruises, so to speak, ornament the sinner, mark him out, and at the same time heal and amend him. It may also be connected with ver. 27. If a man will not use the lamp which God has given him for illumination and correction, he must expect severe chastisement and sternest discipline. Septuagint, "Bruises (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>) and contusions befall bad men, and plagues that reach to the chambers of the belly." St. Gregory, 'Moral.,' 23:40, "By the blueness of a wound he implies the discipline of blows on the body. But blows in the secret parts of the belly are the wounds of the mind within, which are inflicted by compunction. For as the belly is distended when filled with food, so is the mind puffed up when swollen with wicked thoughts. The blueness, then, of a wound, and blows in the secret parts of the belly, cleanse away evil, because both outward discipline does away with faults, and compunction pierces the distended mind with the punishment of penance. But they differ from each other in this respect, that the wounds of blows give us pain, the sorrows of compunction have good savour. The one afflict and torture, the others restore when they afflict us. Through the one there is sorrow in affliction, through the other there is joy in grief" (Oxford transl.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/20.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>24 The steps of a man depend on Jahve;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And a man - how can he understand his way?<p>Line first is from <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/37-23.htm">Psalm 37:23</a>, but there, where the clause has the verbal predicate &#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1504;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, the meaning is that it is the gracious assistance of God, by virtue of which a man takes certain steps with his feet, while here we have before us a variation of the proverb "der Mensch denkt, Gott lenkt"  equals  man proposes, God disposes, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/16-9.htm">Proverbs 16:9</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/10-23.htm">Jeremiah 10:23</a>; for &#1502;&#1503;, as at <a href="/2_samuel/3-37.htm">2 Samuel 3:37</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/118-23.htm">Psalm 118:23</a>, denotes God in general as conditioning, as the ultimate cause. Man is indeed free to turn himself hither or thither, to decide on this course of conduct or on that, and is therefore responsible for it; but the relations co-operating in all his steps as the possible and defining conditions are God's contrivance and guidance, and the consequences which are connected with his steps and flow therefrom, lie beyond the power of man - every one of his steps is a link of a chain, neither the beginning nor the end of which he can see; while, on the other hand, God's knowledge comprehends the beginning, middle, and end, and the wisdom of God ruling in the sphere of history, makes all human activity, the free action of man, subservient to his world-plan. The question, which has a negative answer, is applicable to man: what, i.e., how shall he understand his way? &#1502;&#1492; is like, e.g., <a href="/exodus/10-26.htm">Exodus 10:26</a>; <a href="/job/9-2.htm">Job 9:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/19-28.htm">Job 19:28</a>, accus., and fluctuates between the functions of a governed accusative: What does he understand... (<a href="/job/11-8.htm">Job 11:8</a>) and an adv.: how, i.e., how so little, how even not, for it is the &#1502;&#1492; of the negative question which has become in (Arab.) ma&#770; a word of negation. The way of a man is his life's-course. This he understands in the present life only relatively, the true unravelling of it remains for the future. </body></html>
