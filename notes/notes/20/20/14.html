A good man is not liable to uneasiness in contriving what he shall do, or in reflecting on what he has done, as those who walk in deceit. And his family fare better for his sake. 8. If great men are good men, they may do much good, and prevent very much evil. 9. Some can say, Through grace, we are cleaner than we have been; but it was the work of the Holy Spirit. 10. See the various deceits men use, of which the love of money is the root. The Lord will not bless what is thus gotten. 11. Parents should observe their children, that they may manage them accordingly. 12. All our powers and faculties are from God, and are to be employed for him. 13. Those that indulge themselves, may expect to want necessaries, which should have been gotten by honest labour. 14. Men use arts to get a good bargain, and to buy cheap; whereas a man ought to be ashamed of a fraud and a lie. 15. He that prefers true knowledge to riches, follows the ways of religion and happiness. If we really believed this truth, the word of God would be valued as it deserves, and the world would lose its tempting influence. 16. Those ruin themselves who entangle themselves in rash suretiship. Also those who are in league with abandoned women. Place no confidence in either. 17. Wealth gotten by fraud may be sweet, for the carnal mind takes pleasure in the success of wicked devices; but it will be bitter in the reflection. 18. Especially we need advice in spiritual warfare. The word and Spirit of God are the best counsellors in every point. 19. Those dearly buy their own praise, who put confidence in a man because he speaks fairly. 20. An undutiful child will become very miserable. Never let him expect any peace or comfort. 21. An estate suddenly raised, is often as suddenly ruined. 22. Wait on the Lord, attend his pleasure, and he will protect thee.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Naught - Bad, worthless <a href="/2_kings/2-19.htm">2 Kings 2:19</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/20.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. when &#8230; his way&#8212;implying that he goes about boasting of his bargains.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/proverbs/20.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">It is naught; </span> the commodity is but of little worth.

Two proverbs, of the seeing eye and the necessary opening of the eyes, close it.<p>8 A king sitting on the seat of justice,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Scattereth asunder all evil with his eyes.<p>Excellently the Venet. &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;, for &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1468;&#1488;&#1470;&#1491;&#1497;&#1503; is the name of the seat of rectitude (the tribunal), as the "throne of grace," <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/4-17.htm">Hebrews 4:17</a>, is the name of the capporeth as the seat of mercy; the seat of the judge is merely called &#1499;&#1505;&#1488;; on the other hand, &#1499;&#1505;&#1488;&#1470;&#1491;&#1497;&#1503; is the contrast of &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1468;&#1488; &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; fo, <a href="/psalms/94-20.htm">Psalm 94:20</a> : the seat from which the decision that is in conformity with what is right (cf. e.g., <a href="/jeremiah/5-28.htm">Jeremiah 5:28</a>) goes forth, and where it is sought. As little here as at <a href="/proverbs/20-26.htm">Proverbs 20:26</a> is there need for a characterizing adj. to melek; but the lxx hits the meaning for it, understands such to &#1491;&#1497;&#1503;: &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#837; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;. By the "eyes" are we then to understand those of the mind: he sifts, dignoscit, with the eyes of the mind all that is evil, i.e., distinguishes it subjectively from that which is not evil? Thus Hitzig by a comparison of <a href="/psalms/11-4.htm">Psalm 11:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/139-3.htm">Psalm 139:3</a> (where Jerome has eventilasti, the Vulg. investigasti). Scarcely correctly, for it lies nearer to think on the eyes in the king's head (vid., <a href="/proverbs/16-15.htm">Proverbs 16:15</a>); in that case: to winnow (to sift) means to separate the good and the bad, but first mediately: to exclude the bad; finally, <a href="/proverbs/20-26.htm">Proverbs 20:26</a> leads to the conclusion that &#1502;&#1494;&#1512;&#1492; is to be understood, not of a subjective, but of an actual scattering, or separating, or driving away. Thus the penetrating, fear-inspiring eyes of the king are meant, as Immanuel explains: &#1489;&#1512;&#1488;&#1497;&#1497;&#1514; &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493; &#1502;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1495;&#1501; &#1502;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493; &#1493;&#1502;&#1508;&#1494;&#1512; &#1488;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501; &#1489;&#1499;&#1500; &#1508;&#1497;&#1488;&#1492;. But in this explanation the personal rendering of &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1512;&#1506; is incorrect; for mezareh, meant of the driving asunder of persons, requires as its object a plur. (cf. 26a). Col-ra is understood as neut. like <a href="/proverbs/5-14.htm">Proverbs 5:14</a>. Before the look of a king to whom it belongs to execute righteousness and justice (<a href="/isaiah/16-5.htm">Isaiah 16:5</a>), nothing evil stands; criminal acts and devices seen through, and so also judged by these eyes, are broken up and scattered to all the winds, along with the danger that thereby threatened the community. It is the command: "put away the evil" (<a href="/deuteronomy/13-6.htm">Deuteronomy 13:6</a> [5]), which the king carries into effect by the powerful influence of his look. With col-ra there is connected the thought that in the presence of the heavenly King no one is wholly free from sin. </body></html>
