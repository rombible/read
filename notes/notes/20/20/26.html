The verb is <span class="accented">zarah</span>, which means "to winnow, or sift." The king separates the wicked and the good, as the winnowing fan or shovel divides the chaff from the wheat. The same metaphor is used of Christ (<a href="/matthew/3-12.htm">Matthew 3:12</a>), "Whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire" (comp. <a href="/jeremiah/15-7.htm">Jeremiah 15:7</a>). Septuagint, "A winnower (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;</span>) of the ungodly is a wise king." <span class="cmt_word">And bringeth the wheel over them.</span> The threshing wheel is meant (see <a href="/isaiah/28-27.htm">Isaiah 28:27</a>; <a href="/amos/1-3.htm">Amos 1:3</a>). This was a wooden frame with three or four rollers under it armed with iron teeth. It was drawn by two oxen, and, aided by the weight of the driver, who had his seat upon it, it crushed out the grain, and cut up the straw into fodder. Another machine much used in Palestine was made of two thick planks fastened together side by side, and having sharp stones fixed in rows on the lower surface. It is not implied that the king employed the corn drag as an instrument of punishment, which was sometimes so used in war, as possibly may be inferred from <a href="/2_samuel/12-31.htm">2 Samuel 12:31</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/20-3.htm">1 Chronicles 20:3</a>; and <a href="/amos/1-3.htm">Amos 1:3</a>. The idea of threshing is carried on, and the notion is rather of separation than of punishment, though the latter is not wholly excluded. The wise ruler will not only distinguish between the godless and the good, but will show his discrimination by visiting the evil with condign puuishment. Septuagint, "He will bring the wheel upon them;" the Vulgate has curiously, <span class="accented">Incurvat super eos fornicem</span>, "He bends an arch over them," which Latin commentators explain as a triumphal arch, meaning that the king conquers and subdues the wicked, and celebrates his victory over them. A patent anachronism which needs no comment! <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/20.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The following group begins, for once more the aim of this older Book of Proverbs becomes prominent, with an inculcation of the fourth<p>(Note: i.e., The fifth according to the arrangement of the Westminster Confession.)<p>commandment.<p>20 He that curseth his father and his mother,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His light is extinguished in midnight darkness.<p>The divine law, <a href="/exodus/21-17.htm">Exodus 21:17</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/20-9.htm">Leviticus 20:9</a>, condemns such an one to death. But the proverb does not mean this sentence against the criminal, which may only seldom be carried into execution, but the fearful end which, because of the righteousness of God ruling in history, terminates the life of such an unnatural son (<a href="/proverbs/30-17.htm">Proverbs 30:17</a>). Of the godless, it has already been said that their light is extinguished, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/13-9.htm">Proverbs 13:9</a>, there is suddenly an end to all that brightened, i.e., made happy and embellished their life; but he who acts wickedly (&#1511;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500;, R. &#1511;&#1500;, levem esse, synon. &#1492;&#1511;&#1500;&#1492;, <a href="/deuteronomy/27-16.htm">Deuteronomy 27:16</a>), even to the cursing of his father and mother, will see himself surrounded by midnight darkness (Symmachus, &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#837;, moonless night), not: he will see himself in the greatest need, forsaken by divine protection (Fleischer), for Jansen rightly: Lux et lucerna in scripturis et vitae claritatem et posteritatem et prosperitatem significat. The apple of the eye, &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503;, of darkness (vid., <a href="/proverbs/7-9.htm">Proverbs 7:9</a>), is that which forms the centre of centralization of darkness. The Syr. renders it correctly by bobtho, pupil of the eye, but the Targ. retains the &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503; of the Ker&#305;&#770;, and renders it in Aram. by &#1488;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;, which Rashi regards as an infin., Parchon as a particip. after the form &#1506;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498;; but it may be also an infin. substantive after the form &#1506;&#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494;, and is certainly nothing else than the abbreviated and vocally obscured &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503;. For the Talm. &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1503;, to be hard, furnishes no suitable idea; and the same holds true of &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;, times, <a href="/leviticus/15-25.htm">Leviticus 15:25</a> of the Jerusalem Targ.; while the same abbreviation and the same passing over of o into u represents this as the inflected &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503; ( equals  &#1506;&#1514;). There is also no evidence for a verb &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1503;, to be black, dark; the author of Aruch interprets &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1504;&#1488;, Bereschith Rabba, c. 33, with reference to the passage before us, of a dark bathing apartment, but only tentatively, and &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503; is there quoted as the Targ. of &#1510;&#1500;, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/19-8.htm">Genesis 19:8</a>, which the text lying before us does not ratify. Ishon means the little man (in the eye), and neither the blackness (Buxtorf and others) nor the point of strength, the central point (Levy) of the eye.<p>(Note: Vid., Fleischer in Levy's Chald.
