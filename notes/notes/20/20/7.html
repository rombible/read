A good man is not liable to uneasiness in contriving what he shall do, or in reflecting on what he has done, as those who walk in deceit. And his family fare better for his sake. 8. If great men are good men, they may do much good, and prevent very much evil. 9. Some can say, Through grace, we are cleaner than we have been; but it was the work of the Holy Spirit. 10. See the various deceits men use, of which the love of money is the root. The Lord will not bless what is thus gotten. 11. Parents should observe their children, that they may manage them accordingly. 12. All our powers and faculties are from God, and are to be employed for him. 13. Those that indulge themselves, may expect to want necessaries, which should have been gotten by honest labour. 14. Men use arts to get a good bargain, and to buy cheap; whereas a man ought to be ashamed of a fraud and a lie. 15. He that prefers true knowledge to riches, follows the ways of religion and happiness. If we really believed this truth, the word of God would be valued as it deserves, and the world would lose its tempting influence. 16. Those ruin themselves who entangle themselves in rash suretiship. Also those who are in league with abandoned women. Place no confidence in either. 17. Wealth gotten by fraud may be sweet, for the carnal mind takes pleasure in the success of wicked devices; but it will be bitter in the reflection. 18. Especially we need advice in spiritual warfare. The word and Spirit of God are the best counsellors in every point. 19. Those dearly buy their own praise, who put confidence in a man because he speaks fairly. 20. An undutiful child will become very miserable. Never let him expect any peace or comfort. 21. An estate suddenly raised, is often as suddenly ruined. 22. Wait on the Lord, attend his pleasure, and he will protect thee.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Goodness - With the special sense of bounty, beneficence.

So the Septuagint and Vulgate. The man of pure life, who religiously performs his duty towards God and man, shall bring a blessing on his children who follow his good example, both during his life and after his death. The temporal promise is seen in <a href="/exodus/20-6.htm">Exodus 20:6</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/4-40.htm">Deuteronomy 4:40</a>; <a href="/psalms/112-2.htm">Psalm 112:2</a>, etc. Some see here an instance of utilitarianism; but it cannot be supposed that the writer inculcates virtue for the sake of the worldly advantages connected with it; rather he speaks from experience, and from a faithful dependence on Providence, of the happy results of a holy life. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/20.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>This proverb warns against the debauchery with which free-thinking is intimately associated.<p>Wine is a mocker, mead boisterous;<p>And no one who is overtaken thereby is wise.<p>The article stands with &#1497;&#1497;&#1503;. Ewald maintains that in 10:1-22:6 the article occurs only here and at <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/21-31.htm">Proverbs 21:31</a>, and that it is here, as the lxx shows, not original. Both statements are incorrect. The article is found, e.g., at <a href="/proverbs/19-6.htm">Proverbs 19:6</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/18-18.htm">Proverbs 18:18</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/18-17.htm">Proverbs 18:17</a>, and here the personification of "wine" requires it; but that it is wanting to &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1512; shows how little poetry delights in it; it stands once for twice. The effects of wine and mead (&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1512; from &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1512;, to stop, obstruct, become stupid) are attributed to these liquors themselves as their property. Wine is a mocker, because he who is intoxicated with it readily scoffs at that which is holy; mead is boisterous (cf. &#1492;&#1493;&#1502;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, <a href="/proverbs/7-11.htm">Proverbs 7:11</a>), because he who is inebriated in his dissolute madness breaks through the limits of morality and propriety. He is unwise who, through wine and the like, i.e., overpowered by it (cf. <a href="/2_samuel/13-28.htm">2 Samuel 13:28</a>), staggers, i.e., he gives himself up to wine to such a degree that he is no longer master of himself. At <a href="/proverbs/5-19.htm">Proverbs 5:19</a> we read, &#1513;&#1473;&#1490;&#1492; &#1489;, of the intoxication of love; here, as at <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/28-7.htm">Isaiah 28:7</a>, of the intoxication of wine, i.e., of the passionate slavish desire of wine or for wine. The word "Erpicht" [avidissimus], i.e., being indissolubly bound to a thing, corresponds at least in some degree to the idea. Fleischer compares the French: tre fou de quelque chose. <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/28-7.htm">Isaiah 28:7</a>, however, shows that one has to think on actual staggering, being overtaken in wine. </body></html>
