The terror which a king causes when his anger is rising is like the roar of a lion, which betokens danger. Septuagint, "The threat of a king differeth not from the wrath of a lion." Whoso provoketh him to anger sinneth against his own soul; imperils his life, which he has no right wilfully to jeopard. Septuagint, "He who enrageth him (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>)."

The meaning of the proverb has a complete commentary at <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/21-11.htm">Proverbs 21:11</a>, where its two parts are otherwise expressed with perfect identity of thought. In regard to the &#1500;&#1509;, with whom denunciation and threatening bear no fruit (<a href="/proverbs/13-1.htm">Proverbs 13:1</a>; <a href="/proverbs/15-12.htm">Proverbs 15:12</a>), and perhaps even produce the contrary effect to that intended (<a href="/proverbs/9-7.htm">Proverbs 9:7</a>), there remains nothing else than to vindicate the injured truths by means of the private justice of corporal punishment. Such words, if spoken to the right man, in the right spirit, at the right time, may affect him with wholesome terrors; but even though he is not made better thereby, yet the simple, who listens to the mockeries of such not without injury, will thereby become prudent (gain &#1492;&#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;  equals  &#1506;&#1512;&#1502;&#1492;, prudence, as at <a href="/proverbs/15-5.htm">Proverbs 15:5</a>), i.e., either arrive at the knowledge that the mockery of religion is wicked, or guard himself against incurring the same repressive measures.

That which the deterring lesson of exemplary punishment approximately effects with the wavering, is, in the case of the man of understanding, perfectly attained by an instructive word.<p>We have now reached the close of the third chief section of the older Book of Proverbs. All the three sections begin with &#1489;&#1468;&#1503; &#1495;&#1499;&#1501;, <a href="/proverbs/10-1.htm">Proverbs 10:1</a>; <a href="/proverbs/13-1.htm">Proverbs 13:1</a>; <a href="/proverbs/15-20.htm">Proverbs 15:20</a>. The Introduction, chap. 1-9, dedicates this collection of Solomonic proverbs to youth, and the three beginnings accordingly relate to the relative duties of a son to his father and mother. We are now no longer far from the end, for <a href="/proverbs/22-17.htm">Proverbs 22:17</a> resumes the tone of the Introduction. The third principal part would be disproportionately large if it extended from <a href="/proverbs/15-1.htm">Proverbs 15:1</a> to <a href="/proverbs/22-15.htm">Proverbs 22:15</a>. But there does not again occur a proverb beginning with the words "son of man." We can therefore scarcely go wrong if we take <a href="/proverbs/19-26.htm">Proverbs 19:26</a> as the commencement of a fourth principal part. The Masora divides the whole Mishle into eight sedarim, which exhibit so little knowledge of the true division, that the parashas (sections) <a href="/proverbs/10-1.htm">Proverbs 10:1</a>; <a href="/proverbs/22-17.htm">Proverbs 22:17</a> do not at all find their right place.<p>(Note: The 915 verses of the Mishle, according to the Masora, fall into eight sedarim, beginning as follows: <a href="/proverbs/1-1.htm">Proverbs 1:1</a>; <a href="/proverbs/5-18.htm">Proverbs 5:18</a>; <a href="/proverbs/9-12.htm">Proverbs 9:12</a>; <a href="/proverbs/14-4.htm">Proverbs 14:4</a>; <a href="/proverbs/18-10.htm">Proverbs 18:10</a>; <a href="/proverbs/22-22.htm">Proverbs 22:22</a>; <a href="/proverbs/25-13.htm">Proverbs 25:13</a>; <a href="/proverbs/28-16.htm">Proverbs 28:16</a>.)<p>The MSS, however, contain evidences that this Hagiograph was also anciently divided into parashas, which were designated partly by spaces between the lines (sethumoth) and partly by breaks in the lines (phethucoth). In Baer's Cod. Jamanensis,<p>(Note: Vid., the Prefatio to the Masoretico-Critical Edition of Isaiah by Baer and myself; Leipzig, 1872.)<p>after <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/6-19.htm">Proverbs 6:19</a>, there is the letter &#1508; written on the margin as the mark of such a break.

In the MS of the Graecus Venetus, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/19-11.htm">Proverbs 19:11</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/19-16.htm">Proverbs 19:16</a>, and <a href="/proverbs/19-19.htm">Proverbs 19:19</a> have their initial letters coloured red; but why only these verses, is not manifest. A comparison of the series of proverbs distinguished by such initials with the Cod. Jaman. and Cod. II of the Leipzig City Library, makes it more than probable that it gives a traditional division of the Mishle, which may perhaps yet be discovered by a comparison of MSS.<p>(Note: Vid., Gebhardt's Prolegomena to his new edition of the Versio Veneta.)<p>But this much is clear, that a historico-literary reconstruction of the Mishle, and of its several parts, can derive no help from this comparison. </body></html>
