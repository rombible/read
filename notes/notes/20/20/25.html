The Vulgate has, <span class="accented">Ruina est homini devorare sanctos</span>, which is explained to mean that it is destruction for a man to persecute the saints of God. But the word <span class="accented">devorare</span> is not certain, as the manuscripts vary between this and four other readings, viz. <span class="accented">devotares, denotare, devovere</span>, and <span class="accented">devocare.</span> The Authorized Version signifies that it is a sin to take for one's own consumption things dedicated to God, as firstfruits, the priests' portions, etc.: or a man's snare, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his covetousness (<a href="/1_timothy/6-9.htm">1 Timothy 6:9</a>), leads him to commit sacrilege.

The clause will then run, "It is a snare to a man rashly to cry, Holiness!" equivalent to "It is holy!" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to use the formula for consecrating something to holy purposes.
