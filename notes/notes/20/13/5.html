The Revised Version margin, "causeth shame and bringeth reproach." Delitzsch, "brings into bad odour (<a href="/genesis/34-30.htm">Genesis 34:30</a>) and causes shame." Hitzig, "behaveth injuriously and shamefully." The antithesis is best brought out by the rendering that marks the effect of the wicked man's "lying;" "He brings disgrace upon others (who have trusted him or have been associated with him) and causes shame." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>27 The slothful pursues not his prey;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But a precious possession of a man is diligence.<p>The lxx, Syr., Targ., and Jerome render &#1497;&#1495;&#1512;&#1498; in the sense of obtaining or catching, but the verbal stem &#1495;&#1512;&#1498; nowhere has this meaning. When Fleischer remarks, &#1495;&#1512;&#1498;, &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;., probably like &#1500;&#1499;&#1491;, properly to entangle in a noose, a net, he supports his opinion by reference to &#1495;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, which signifies lattice-windows, properly, woven or knitted like a net. But &#1495;&#1512;&#1498;, whence this &#1495;&#1512;&#1499;&#1497;&#1501;, appears to be equivalent to the Arab. khark&#803;, fissura, so that the plur. gives the idea of a manifoldly divided (lattice-like, trellis-formed) window. The Jewish lexicographers (Menahem, Abulwald, Parchon, also Juda b. Koreish) all aim at that which is in accord with the meaning of the Aram. &#1495;&#1512;&#1498;, to singe, to roast ( equals  Arab. h&#803;ark): the slothful roasteth not his prey, whether (as Frst presents it) because he is too lazy to hunt for it (Berth.), or because when he has it he prepares it not for enjoyment (Ewald). But to roast is &#1510;&#1500;&#1492;, not &#1491;&#1512;&#1498;, which is used only of singeing, e.g., the hair, and roasting, e.g., ears of corn, but not of the roasting of flesh, for which reason Joseph Kimchi (vid., Kimchi's Lex.) understands &#1510;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493; of wild fowls, and &#1497;&#1495;&#1512;&#1498; of the singeing of the tips of the wings, so that they cannot fly away, according to which the Venet. translates &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834; ... &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;. Thus the Arab. must often help to a right interpretation of the &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;.. Schultens is right: Verbum h&#803;arak, &#1495;&#1512;&#1498;, apud Arabes est movere, ciere, excitare, &#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd; generatim, et speciatim excitare praedam e cubili, &#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd; &#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;. The Lat. agitare, used of the frightening up and driving forth of wild beasts, corresponds with the idea here, as e.g., used by Ovid, Metam. x. 538, of Diana:<p>Aut pronos lepores aue celsum in cornua cervum<p>Aut agitat damas.<p>Thus &#1497;&#1495;&#1512;&#1498; together with &#1510;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493; gains the meaning of hunting, and generally of catching the prey. &#1512;&#1502;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; is here incarnate slothfulness, and thus without ellipse equivalent to &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1512;&#1502;&#1497;&#1492;. That in the contrasted clause &#1495;&#1512;&#1493;&#1509; does not mean &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;, decreed (Lwenstein), nor gold (Targ., Jerome, Venet.), nor that which is excellent (Syr.), is manifest from this contrast as well as from <a href="/proverbs/10-4.htm">Proverbs 10:4</a>; <a href="/proverbs/12-24.htm">Proverbs 12:24</a>. The clause has from its sequence of words something striking about it. The lxx placed the words in a difference order: &#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3c1; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; (&#1495;&#1500;&#1493;&#1509; in the sense of Arab. kha&#770;las&#803;). But besides this transposition, two others have been tried: &#1492;&#1493;&#1503; &#1488;&#1491;&#1501; &#1495;&#1512;&#1493;&#1509; &#1497;&#1511;&#1512;, the possession of an industrious man is precious, and &#1492;&#1493;&#1503; &#1497;&#1511;&#1512; &#1488;&#1491;&#1501; &#1495;&#1512;&#1493;&#1509;, a precious possession is that (supply &#1492;&#1493;&#1503;) of an industrious man. But the traditional arrangement of the words gives a better meaning than these modifications. It is not, however, to be explained, with Ewald and Bertheau: a precious treasure of a man is one who is industrious, for why should the industrious man be thought of as a worker for another and not for himself? Another explanation advanced by Kimchi: a valuable possession to men is industry, has the twofold advantage that it is according to the existing sequence of the words, and presents a more intelligible thought. But can &#1495;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509; have the meaning of &#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; (the being industrious)? Hitzig reads &#1495;&#1512;&#1493;&#1509;, to make haste (to be industrious). This is unnecessary, for we have here a case similar to <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/10-17.htm">Proverbs 10:17</a>, where &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512; for &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1502;&#1512; is to be expected: a precious possession of a man is it that, or when, he is industrious, &#1495;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509; briefly for &#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514;&#1493; &#1495;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509; rof yl. The accentuation fluctuates between &#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1503;&#1470;&#1488;&#1491;&#1501; &#1497;&#1511;&#1512; (so e.g., Cod. 1294), according to which the Targum translates, and &#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1503;&#1470;&#1488;&#1491;&#1501; &#1497;&#1511;&#1512;, which, according to our explanation, is to be preferred. </body></html>
