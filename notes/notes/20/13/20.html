The rule by which the wise regulate their conduct, is a fountain yielding life and happiness. 15. The way of sinners is hard upon others, and hard to the sinner himself. The service of sin is slavery; the road to hell is strewed with the thorns and thistles that followed the curse. 16. It is folly to talk of things of which we know nothing, and to undertake what we are no way fit for. 17. Those that are wicked, and false to Christ and to the souls of men, do mischief, and fall into mischief; but those that are faithful, find sound words healing to others and to themselves. 18. He that scorns to be taught, will certainly be brought down. 19. There are in man strong desires after happiness; but never let those expect any thing truly sweet to their souls, who will not be persuaded to leave their sins. 20. Multitudes are brought to ruin by bad company. And all that make themselves wicked will be destroyed. 21. When God pursues sinners he is sure to overtake them; and he will reward the righteous. 22. The servant of God who is not anxious about riches, takes the best method of providing for his children. 23. The poor, yet industrious, thrive, though in a homely manner, while those who have great riches are often brought to poverty for want of judgment. 24. He acts as if he hated his child, who, by false indulgence, permits sinful habits to gather strength, which will bring sorrow here, and misery hereafter. 25. It is the misery of the wicked, that even their sensual appetites are always craving. The righteous feeds on the word and ordinances, to the satisfying of his soul with the promises of the gospel, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who is the Bread of life.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The connection is somewhat obscure. Either, "Satisfied desire is pleasant, therefore it is an abomination to fools to depart from the evil on which their minds are set;" or, "Sweet is the satisfaction of desire, yet the wicked will not depart from the evil which makes that satisfaction impossible." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20.

Who is a companion of them that fear the Lord; converses frequently with them in private about spiritual and experimental things, and walks with them in public in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord; he by those means grows wiser and wiser, gains a large stock of spiritual knowledge and experience; for this holds good both in natural and spiritual wisdom, a man of any capacity at all will improve by keeping wise company; <p>but a companion of fools shall be destroyed; the Vulgate Latin version renders it, "shall become like them"; be a fool as they are, and grow still more and more foolish. The Septuagint version is, "shall be known"; known by the company he keeps to be a fool also: or rather, "shall be broken" (t); ruined and destroyed, "evil communications corrupt good manners", <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-33.htm">1 Corinthians 15:33</a>, and so bring to ruin and destruction. <p>(t) "conteretur", Pagninus, Montanus, Piscator, Mercerus, Gejerus; "conquassabitur", Cocceius; "fragetur", Michaelis; "infringetur", Schultens, so Ben Melech. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/13.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">He that walketh with wise <i>men</i> shall be wise: but a companion of fools shall be <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> destroyed.</span><p>(i) As he is partaker of their wickedness, and bears with their vices, so will he be punished alike as they are.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/13.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">20</span>. <span class="ital">He that walketh</span>] Or (with a change of Heb. vowel points), <span class="ital">Walk with wise men and be wise</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">destroyed</span>] Lit. <span class="bld">be broken</span>.

But the antithesis is not well brought out by this rendering: and as the word may bear the sense of "doing ill" as well as of "suffering ill," the interpretation of the Vulgat. intimates the correct idea of the clause: "The friend of fools shall turn out the same;" "He who associates with fools shall do evil." Septuagint, "He who roams about with fools shall be known." "Tell me your companions, and I will tell you what you are." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Talis quis esse putatur qualis ei est sodalitas."</span> A Dutch proverb says, "He that lives with cripples learns to limp;" and the Spanish, "He that goes with wolves learns to howl." We have a homely English proverb, "He that lies down with dogs shall rise up with fleas;" so the Orientals say," He that takes the raven for his guide shall light upon carrion." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/13.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>14 The doctrine of the wise man is a fountain of life,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To escape the snares of death.<p>An integral distich, vid., p. 8 of the Introduction. Essentially like 14a, <a href="/proverbs/10-11.htm">Proverbs 10:11</a> says, "a fountain of life is the mouth of the righteous." The figure of the fountain of life with the teleological '&#1500;&#1505;&#1493;&#1512; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; (the &#1500; of the end and consequence of the action) is repeated <a href="/proverbs/14-27.htm">Proverbs 14:27</a>. The common non-biblical figure of the laquei mortis leads also to the idea of death as &#1497;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; a fowler, <a href="/psalms/91-3.htm">Psalm 91:3</a>. If it is not here a mere formula for the dangers of death (Hitzig), then the proverb is designed to state that the life which springs from the doctrine of the wise man as from a fountain of health, for the disciple who will receive it, communicates to him knowledge and strength, to know where the snares of destruction lie, and to hasten with vigorous steps away when they threaten to entangle him. </body></html>
