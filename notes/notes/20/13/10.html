An honest desire to do right, preserves a man from fatal mistakes, better than a thousand fine-drawn distinctions. 7. Some who are really poor, trade and spend as if they were rich: this is sin, and will be shame, and it will end accordingly. Some that are really rich, would be thought to be poor: in this there is want of gratitude to God, want of justice and charity to others. There are many hypocrites, empty of grace, who will not be convinced of their poverty. There are many fearing Christians, who are spiritually rich, yet think themselves poor; by their doubts, and complaints, and griefs, they make themselves poor. 8. Great riches often tempt to violence against those that possess them; but the poor are free from such perils. 9. The light of the righteous is as that of the sun, which may be eclipsed and clouded, but will continue: the Spirit is their Light, he gives a fulness of joy: that of the wicked is as a lamp of their own kindling, easily put out. 10. All contentions, whether between private persons, families, churches, or nations, are begun and carried forward by pride. Disputes would be easily prevented or ended, if it were not for pride. 11. Wealth gotten by dishonesty or vice, has a secret curse, which will speedily waste it. 12. The delay of what is anxiously hoped for, is very painful to the mind; obtaining it is very pleasant.

Though it comes by other things, yet by this chiefly, and there are no contentions without it: or "truly", "verily", "certainly (d), by pride", &amp;c. Unless the words may be better rendered, "an empty man through pride will give contention" (e), or make it; such as are empty of knowledge and wisdom; and such are generally the most proud, and are very apt to raise contentions, and foment divisions: contentions in families, in neighbourhoods, in towns, cities, and countries, and in churches, are generally owing to pride; what contentions and confusions has the pride of the pope of Rome brought into kingdoms and states, into councils, and into the church of God! <p>but with the well advised is wisdom: such who are humble and modest will seek counsel of God; will consult the sacred oracles, and ask advice of those who are superior to them in knowledge and understanding; and so will neither raise contentions themselves, nor join with those that make them, but do all they can to lay them; these show that true wisdom is with them. <p>(d) "certe", Vatablus; "vere", Pagninus, Montanus, Merecrus.

Others rightly translate, "By pride cometh only, nothing but, contention." Vulgate, "Between the proud disputes are always rife."

As the Vulgate puts it, "They who do all things with counsel are directed by wisdom."

One might, it is true, add &#1492; to the following word here, as at <a href="/proverbs/14-13.htm">Proverbs 14:13</a>; but the similar expression appertaining to the syntax ornata occurs also <a href="/2_samuel/22-33.htm">2 Samuel 22:33</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/71-7.htm">Psalm 71:7</a>, and elsewhere, where this is impracticable.

With reference to the &#1493;&#1488;&#1497;&#1503; here violently (cf. <a href="/proverbs/28-1.htm">Proverbs 28:1</a>) introduced, Bttcher rightly remarks, that it is an adverb altogether like necquidquam, <a href="/proverbs/14-6.htm">Proverbs 14:6</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/20-4.htm">Proverbs 20:4</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/68-21.htm">Psalm 68:21</a>, etc., thus: appetit necquidquam anima ejus, scilicet pigri. 4b shows the meaning of the desire that has not, for there &#1514;&#1491;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1503; occurs, a favourite strong Mishle word (<a href="/proverbs/11-25.htm">Proverbs 11:25</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/28-25.htm">Proverbs 28:25</a>, etc.) for abundant satisfaction (the lxx here, as at 28:25, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#837;, sc. &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, instead of which, Montfaucon supposed &#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#837;, which is, however, a word not authenticated). The slothful wishes and dreams of prosperity and abundance (cf. <a href="/proverbs/21-25.htm">Proverbs 21:25</a>., a parallel which the Syr. has here in view), but his desire remains unsatisfied, since the object is not gained but only lost by doing nothing; the industrious gain, and that richly, what the slothful wishes for, but in vain. </body></html>
