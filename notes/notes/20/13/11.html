An honest desire to do right, preserves a man from fatal mistakes, better than a thousand fine-drawn distinctions. 7. Some who are really poor, trade and spend as if they were rich: this is sin, and will be shame, and it will end accordingly. Some that are really rich, would be thought to be poor: in this there is want of gratitude to God, want of justice and charity to others. There are many hypocrites, empty of grace, who will not be convinced of their poverty. There are many fearing Christians, who are spiritually rich, yet think themselves poor; by their doubts, and complaints, and griefs, they make themselves poor. 8. Great riches often tempt to violence against those that possess them; but the poor are free from such perils. 9. The light of the righteous is as that of the sun, which may be eclipsed and clouded, but will continue: the Spirit is their Light, he gives a fulness of joy: that of the wicked is as a lamp of their own kindling, easily put out. 10. All contentions, whether between private persons, families, churches, or nations, are begun and carried forward by pride. Disputes would be easily prevented or ended, if it were not for pride. 11. Wealth gotten by dishonesty or vice, has a secret curse, which will speedily waste it. 12. The delay of what is anxiously hoped for, is very painful to the mind; obtaining it is very pleasant. But spiritual blessings are chiefly intended.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>By vanity - literally, "by a breath," i. e., by a windfall, or sudden stroke of fortune, not by honest labor.

The righteous hateth all that bears in it the character of a falsehood (punctuate &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1512; with Gaja, cf. <a href="/proverbs/12-19.htm">Proverbs 12:19</a>), but the godless ... Should we now, with Bertheau, Hitzig, and others, translate "acteth basely and shamefully"? It is true that both Hiphs. may be regarded as transitive, but this expression gives not right contrast to 5a, and is pointless. We have seen at <a href="/proverbs/10-5.htm">Proverbs 10:5</a> that &#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, like &#1492;&#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;, has also a causative signification: to put to shame, i.e., bring shame upon others, and that <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/19-26.htm">Proverbs 19:26</a>, where &#1502;&#1489;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1495;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512; are connected, this causative signification lies nearer than the intrinsically transitive. Thus it will also here be meant, that while the righteous hateth all that is false or that is tainted by falsehood, the godless on the contrary loves to disgrace and to put to shame. But it is a question whether &#1497;&#1489;&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; is to be derived from &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;  equals  &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;, and thus is of the same meaning as &#1497;&#1489;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;; &#1492;&#1489;&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/30-5.htm">Isaiah 30:5</a>, which there signifies pudefactum esse, is pointed &#1492;&#1489;&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, and is thus derived from a &#1497;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473;  equals  &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;, vid., <a href="/2_samuel/19-6.htm">2 Samuel 19:6</a>. But &#1492;&#1489;&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; occurs also as Hiph. of &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;, and means transitively to make of an evil savour, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/34-30.htm">Genesis 34:30</a>, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/5-21.htm">Exodus 5:21</a>, as well as intransitively to come into evil savour, <a href="/1_samuel/27-12.htm">1 Samuel 27:12</a>. In this sense of putidum faciens, bringing into evil savour, &#1497;&#1489;&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; occurs here as at <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/19-26.htm">Proverbs 19:26</a>, suitably along with &#1497;&#1495;&#1508;&#1497;&#1512;; <a href="/proverbs/19-26.htm">Proverbs 19:26</a> is the putidum facere by evil report (slander), into which the foolish son brings his parents, here by his own evil report, thus to be thought of as brought about by means of slander. The old translators here fall into error; Luther renders both Hiphils reflexively; only the Venet. (after Kimchi) is right: &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; (from an &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd; as trans. to &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;) &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;, he makes to be of ill odour and dishonours. </body></html>
