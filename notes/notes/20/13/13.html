The word of God. Either Christ, the essential Word; which must be a great evil, considering the dignity of his person; great ingratitude, considering the grace of his office; very dangerous, considering what a quick, sharp, and powerful Word he is: and such may be said to despise him who despise his ministers, and the Gospel preached by them; and which may be meant by the word, that being the word of God and of truth, the word of righteousness, peace, life, and salvation; and is to them that perish foolishness; and to whom it is so, they shall perish, and be punished with everlasting destruction, for their contempt of it, and disobedience to it. Or the written word may be meant, the Scriptures, which are given by inspiration of God, and therefore ought to be had in the greatest reverence; and yet are greatly slighted and despised by the man of sin and his followers; who set up and prefer their unwritten traditions to them, and so make them of none effect: such are all false teachers, that despise or abuse them, they bring destruction to themselves; for so the words may be rendered, "shall bring destruction to himself", or shall receive detriment from it: so the Targum, from the word itself; the Syriac version, "by it"; and the Arabic version, "by the commandment itself"; by the threatenings in it, and according to them: or, "because of it"; because of the contempt of it; <p>but he that feareth the commandment; receives the word with reverence, trembles at it; fears God, and keeps his commandments, and fears to break them: he <p>shall be rewarded; with good, as the Targum adds; for in keeping the commandments of God there is great reward: or, "shall enjoy peace", or "be in safety" (k); for great peace have they which love the law of God, and serve it: or, "shall be sound, and in health" (l); when those that despise it "shall be corrupted" (m); as the word in the preceding clause may be rendered. <p>(k) "in pace versabitur", V.

With this agrees <span class="greekheb">ὄς καταφρονεῖ πράγματος</span>, LXX.

He who despises and neglects this word "brings on himself destruction." Many good authorities take the latter verb in another sense, "is pledged by it;" as Revised Version in margin, "maketh himself a debtor thereto," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> is still bound to fulfil his obligations to it; he cannot escape duty by ignoring or despising it, but is pledged to do it, and will suffer for its neglect. Hence Christ's injunction to agree with our adversary quickly while we are in the way with him (<a href="/matthew/5-25.htm">Matthew 5:25</a>). Vulgate, "He who disparages (<span class="accented">detrahit</span>) anything binds himself for the future." Septuagint, "He who despises a thing (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, 'a command') shall be despised by it." <span class="accented">Virtus se contemnentem contemnit. <span class="cmt_word"></span>He that feareth the commandment shall be rewarded</span> (<a href="/proverbs/11-31.htm">Proverbs 11:31</a>). The Vulgate rendering, "shall live in peace," and that of the Septuagint, "shall be healthful," are not so suitable. The "fearing the commandment" implies obedience to it; and reward is considered as fully pledged to obedience as punishment is to neglect. The Septuagint here adds a distich which Ewald regards as genuine, "Unto a crafty son there shall be nothing good; but to a wise servant all actions shall prosper, and his way shall be guided aright." This is also found in the Vulgate of <a href="/proverbs/14-15.htm">Proverbs 14:15</a>. The Vulgate here inserts the paragraph found in the Septuagint at ver. 9 (<span class="accented">q.v</span>.), <span class="accented">Animae dolosae errant in peccatis</span>; <span class="accented">justi autem misericordes sunt et miserantur.</span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/13.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Two proverbs of riches and poverty: - <p>There is one who maketh himself rich and hath nothing;<p>There is another who representeth himself poor amid great riches.<p>A sentence which includes in itself the judgment which <a href="/proverbs/12-9.htm">Proverbs 12:9</a> expresses.
