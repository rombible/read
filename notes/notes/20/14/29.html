Sin is the shame of sinners; but wisdom is the honour of the wise. 19. Even bad men acknowledge the excellency of God's people. 20. Friendship in the world is governed by self-interest. It is good to have God our Friend; he will not desert us. 21. To despise a man for his employment or appearance is a sin. 22. How wisely those consult their own interest, who not only do good, but devise it! 23. Labour of the head, or of the hand, will turn to some good account. But if men's religion runs all out in talk and noise, they will come to nothing. 24. The riches of men of wisdom and piety enlarge their usefulness. 25. An upright man will venture the displeasure of the greatest, to bring truth to light. 26,27. Those who fear the Lord so as to obey and serve him, have a strong ground of confidence, and will be preserved. Let us seek to this Fountain of life, that we may escape the snares of death. 28. Let all that wish well to the kingdom of Christ, do what they can, that many may be added to his church. 29. A mild, patient man is one that learns of Christ, who is Wisdom itself. Unbridled passion is folly made known. 30. An upright, contented, and benevolent mind, tends to health. 31. To oppress the poor is to reproach our Creator. 32. The wicked man has his soul forced from him; he dies in his sins, under the guilt and power of them. But godly men, though they have pain and some dread of death, have the blessed hope, which God, who cannot lie, has given them. 33. Wisdom possesses the heart, and thus regulates the affections and tempers. 34. Piety and holiness always promote industry, sobriety, and honesty. 35. The great King who reigns over heaven and earth, will reward faithful servants who honour his gospel by the proper discharge of the duties of their stations: he despises not the services of the lowest.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Exalteth folly - Lifts it up, as it were, on high, and exposes it to the gaze of all men. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>29. slow &#8230; understanding&#8212;(Compare Pr 14:17).<p>hasty&#8212;(Compare Pr 14:17).<p>exalteth folly&#8212;makes it conspicuous, as if delighting to honor it.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/proverbs/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Is of great understanding; </span> showeth great and true wisdom in conquering his sinful and shameful passions. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Exalteth, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">lifteth up</span>, like a banner; makes it known and visible to all men. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/proverbs/14.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>He that is slow to wrath is of great understanding,....

That organ, into which was breathed the breath of life (<a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>), is taken as the seat of the inward spirit, and as showing by exterior signs the dominant feeling. The original is very terse, "long in nostrils, great in understanding." A man's prudence and wisdom are displayed by his being slow to take offence and being patient under injury. <span class="cmt_word">He that is hasty of spirit exalteth folly;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> flaunts it in the eyes of all men, makes plain exposure of it. Septuagint, "He who is short in temper is a mighty fool." "Passion," says an old saw, "makes fools of the wise. and shows the folly of the foolish" (comp. <a href="/proverbs/12-23.htm">Proverbs 12:23</a>; <a href="/proverbs/13-16.htm">Proverbs 13:16</a>). The word rendered "exalteth," <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5bc;&#x5e6;&#x5bc;&#x5e6;&#x5bc;</span> (<span class="accented">marim</span>), occurs in <a href="/proverbs/3-35.htm">Proverbs 3:35</a>, and is taken by Delitzsch and Nowack in the sense of "carries away" as the assured result. "By anger," says St. Gregory ('Moral.,' 5:78), "wisdom is parted with, so that we are left wholly in ignorance what to do, and in what order to do it.... Anger withdraws the light of understanding, while by agitating it troubles the mind." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/14.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>There now follows a considerable series of proverbs (<a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/14-23.htm">Proverbs 14:23-31</a>) which, with a single exception (<a href="/proverbs/14-24.htm">Proverbs 14:24</a>), have all this in common, that one or two key-words in them begin with &#1502;.<p>23 In all labour there is gain,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But idle talk leadeth only to loss.<p>Here the key-words are &#1502;&#1493;&#1514;&#1512; and &#1502;&#1495;&#1505;&#1493;&#1512; (parallel <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/21-5.htm">Proverbs 21:5</a>, cf. with <a href="/proverbs/11-24.htm">Proverbs 11:24</a>), which begin with &#1502;. &#1506;&#1510;&#1489; is labour, and that earnest and unwearied, as at <a href="/proverbs/10-22.htm">Proverbs 10:22</a>. If one toils on honestly, then there always results from it something which stands forth above the endeavour as its result and product, vid., at <a href="//biblehub.com/job/30-11.htm">Job 30:11</a>, where it is shown how &#1497;&#1514;&#1512;, from the primary meaning to be stretched out long, acquires the meaning of that which hangs over, shoots over, copiousness, and gain. By the word of the lips, on the contrary, i.e., purposeless and inoperative talk (&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; &#1513;&#1474;&#1508;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501; as <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/36-5.htm">Isaiah 36:5</a>, cf. <a href="/job/11-2.htm">Job 11:2</a>), nothing is gained, but on the contrary there is only loss, for by it one only robs both himself and others of time, and wastes strength, which might have been turned to better purpose, to say nothing of the injury that is thereby done to his soul; perhaps also he morally injures, or at least discomposes and wearies others. </body></html>
