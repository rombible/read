Sin is the shame of sinners; but wisdom is the honour of the wise. 19. Even bad men acknowledge the excellency of God's people. 20. Friendship in the world is governed by self-interest. It is good to have God our Friend; he will not desert us. 21. To despise a man for his employment or appearance is a sin. 22. How wisely those consult their own interest, who not only do good, but devise it! 23. Labour of the head, or of the hand, will turn to some good account. But if men's religion runs all out in talk and noise, they will come to nothing. 24. The riches of men of wisdom and piety enlarge their usefulness. 25. An upright man will venture the displeasure of the greatest, to bring truth to light. 26,27. Those who fear the Lord so as to obey and serve him, have a strong ground of confidence, and will be preserved. Let us seek to this Fountain of life, that we may escape the snares of death. 28. Let all that wish well to the kingdom of Christ, do what they can, that many may be added to his church. 29. A mild, patient man is one that learns of Christ, who is Wisdom itself. Unbridled passion is folly made known. 30. An upright, contented, and benevolent mind, tends to health. 31. To oppress the poor is to reproach our Creator. 32. The wicked man has his soul forced from him; he dies in his sins, under the guilt and power of them. But godly men, though they have pain and some dread of death, have the blessed hope, which God, who cannot lie, has given them. 33. Wisdom possesses the heart, and thus regulates the affections and tempers. 34. Piety and holiness always promote industry, sobriety, and honesty. 35. The great King who reigns over heaven and earth, will reward faithful servants who honour his gospel by the proper discharge of the duties of their stations: he despises not the services of the lowest.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>His children - Probably, the children whom the Lord adopts, and who are true to their adoption. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>26.

St. Gregory ('Moral.,' 5:33), "As in the way of the world fear gives rise to weakness, so in the way of God fear produces strength. In truth, our mind so much the more valorously sets at naught all the terrors of temporal vicissitudes, the more thoroughly that it submits itself in fear to the Author of those same temporal things. And being stablished in the fear of the Lord, it encounters nothing without it to fill it with alarm, in that whereas it is united to the Creator of all things by a righteous fear, it is by a certain powerful influence raised high above them all." Comp. <a href="/psalms/27-1.htm">Psalm 27:1</a> and St. Paul's words, "If God be for us, who can be against us?" (<a href="/romans/8-31.htm">Romans 8:31</a>). Septuagint, "In the fear of the Lord is hope of strength." <span class="cmt_word">And his children shall have a place of refuge</span> (<a href="/psalms/46-1.htm">Psalm 46:1</a>). There is an ambiguity as to whose children are meant. The LXX. renders, "And to his children he will leave a support." Thus many refer the pronoun to the Lord named in the first clause - God's children, those who love and trust him, and look up to him as a Father, an expression used more specially in the New Testament than in the Old. But see <a href="/psalms/73-15.htm">Psalm 73:15</a>, and passages (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="/hosea/11-1.htm">Hosea 11:1</a>) where God calls Israel his son, a type of all who are brought unto him by adoption and grace. Others, again, refer the pronoun to "the fear of the Lord," "its children," which would be quite in conformity with Hebrew idiom; as we have "sons of wisdom," "children of obedience," equivalent to "wise," "obedient," etc. But most modern commentators explain it of the children of the God-fearing man, comparing <a href="/exodus/20-6.htm">Exodus 20:6</a> and <a href="/psalms/103-17.htm">Psalm 103:17</a>. Such a one shall confer lasting benefits upon his posterity (ch. 13:22; 20:7). So God blessed the descendants of Abraham and David; so he shows mercy unto thousands  <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the thousandth generation of them that love him and keep his commandments (see <a href="/genesis/17-7.htm">Genesis 17:7</a>, etc.; <a href="/exodus/34-7.htm">Exodus 34:7</a>; <a href="/1_kings/11-12.htm">1 Kings 11:12</a>, etc.; <a href="/jeremiah/33-20.htm">Jeremiah 33:20</a>, etc.). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/14.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Three proverbs on the hatred of men:<p>20 The poor is hated even by his neighbour;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But of those who love the rich there are many.<p>This is the old history daily repeating itself. Among all people is the saying and the complaint:<p>Donec eris felix multos numerabis amicos,<p>Tempora si fuerint nubilia solus eris.<p>(Note: Ovid, Trist. i.8.)<p>The Book of Proverbs also speaks of this lamentable phenomenon. It is a part of the dark side of human nature, and one should take notice of it, so that when it goes well with him, he may not regard his many friends as all genuine, and when he becomes poor, he may not be surprised by the dissolution of earlier friendship, but may value so much the higher exceptions to the rule. The connection of the passive with &#1500; of the subject (cf. <a href="/proverbs/13-13.htm">Proverbs 13:13</a>), as in the Greek with the dative, is pure Semitic; sometimes it stands with &#1502;&#1503;, but in the sense of &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;, Sol 3:10, before the influence of the West led to its being used in the sense of &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769; (Ges. 143, 2); &#1497;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1504;&#1488;, is hated (Cod. 1294: &#1497;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1504;&#1488;, connects with the hatred which is directed against the poor also the indifference which makes him without sympathy, for one feels himself troubled by him and ashamed. </body></html>
