Sin is the shame of sinners; but wisdom is the honour of the wise. 19. Even bad men acknowledge the excellency of God's people. 20. Friendship in the world is governed by self-interest. It is good to have God our Friend; he will not desert us. 21. To despise a man for his employment or appearance is a sin. 22. How wisely those consult their own interest, who not only do good, but devise it! 23. Labour of the head, or of the hand, will turn to some good account. But if men's religion runs all out in talk and noise, they will come to nothing. 24. The riches of men of wisdom and piety enlarge their usefulness. 25. An upright man will venture the displeasure of the greatest, to bring truth to light. 26,27. Those who fear the Lord so as to obey and serve him, have a strong ground of confidence, and will be preserved. Let us seek to this Fountain of life, that we may escape the snares of death. 28. Let all that wish well to the kingdom of Christ, do what they can, that many may be added to his church. 29. A mild, patient man is one that learns of Christ, who is Wisdom itself. Unbridled passion is folly made known. 30. An upright, contented, and benevolent mind, tends to health. 31. To oppress the poor is to reproach our Creator. 32. The wicked man has his soul forced from him; he dies in his sins, under the guilt and power of them. But godly men, though they have pain and some dread of death, have the blessed hope, which God, who cannot lie, has given them. 33. Wisdom possesses the heart, and thus regulates the affections and tempers. 34. Piety and holiness always promote industry, sobriety, and honesty. 35. The great King who reigns over heaven and earth, will reward faithful servants who honour his gospel by the proper discharge of the duties of their stations: he despises not the services of the lowest.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>"The crown," i. e., the glory of the wise man constitutes his wealth.

It is at once an ornament and a thing of price; whereas the folly of fools is, and always remains (only) folly. It is possible, however, to render, with R.V. marg., <span class="ital">Their riches is a crown unto the wise</span>, gracing and graced by the wearer; but the folly of fools no wealth can ennoble; it is still only folly.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The crown of the wise is their riches.</span> This is taken by some ('Speaker's Commentary') to mean the glory of the wise man, the fame and splendour which surround him, constitute his wealth; but it is better to interpret it thus: Riches are an ornament to a wise man; they enhance and set off his wisdom in the eyes of others, enable him to use it to advantage, and are not the snare which they might be because they are employed religiously and profitably for the good of others. <a href="/ecclesiastes/7-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:11</a>, "Wisdom is good together with an inheritance, and profitable to them that see the sun." The Septuagint has, "The crown of the wise is the clever man (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>)," for which has been substituted by some editors, in agreement with the present Hebrew text, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, " their wealth." The Greek translators, according to their reading, denote that one eminently clever man is a glory to the whole body of wise men. <span class="cmt_word">But the folly of fools is only folly;</span> that is, even though it were accompanied with riches. Decorate folly as you may, trick it out in gaud and ornament, it is still nothing but folly, and is discerned as such, and <span class="accented">that</span> all the more for being made conspicuous. Schultens, followed by Wordsworth, finds a play of words here. The words rendered "fool" and "folly" imply "fatness," like the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span> and the Latin <span class="accented">crassus</span>, which have also this double meaning. So the sentence reads, "Riches are a crown to the wise; but the abundant fatness of fools is only fatness." The last clause is translated by the LXX., "But the fools' way of life (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x1f74;</span>) is evil." St. Gregory ('Moral.,' 22:8) comments on this verse thus: "It was these riches of wisdom that Solomon having before his eyes, saith, 'The crown of the wise is their riches.' Which same person, because it is not metals of earth, but understanding, that he calls by the name of riches, thereupon adds by way of a contrary, 'But the foolishness of fools is imprudence.' For if he called earthly riches the crown of the wise. surely he would own the senselessness of fools to be poverty rather than imprudence. But whereas he added, 'the foolishness of fools is imprudence,' he made it plain that he called prudence 'the riches of the wise'" (Oxford tran cf.). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/14.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>18 The simple have obtained folly as an inheritance;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the prudent put on knowledge as a crown.<p>As a parallel word to &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;, &#1497;&#1499;&#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; (after the Masora defective), also in the sense of Arab. a&#770;kthar, multiplicare, abundare (from Arab. kathura, to be much, perhaps<p>(Note: According to rule the Hebr. &#1513; becomes in Arab. t&#817;, as in Aram. &#1514;; but kthar might be from ktar, an old verb rarely found, which derivata with the idea of encircling (wall) and of rounding (bunch) point to.)<p>properly comprehensive, encompassing), would be appropriate, but it is a word properly Arabic. On the other hand, inappropriate is the meaning of the Heb.-Aram. &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1512;, to wait (properly waiting to surround, to go round any one, cf. manere aliquem or aliquod), according to which Aquila, &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, and Jerome, expectabunt. Also &#1492;&#1499;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;, to encompass in the sense of to embrace (lxx &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;), does not suffice, since in the relation to &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1493; one expects an idea surpassing this. Certainly there is a heightening of the idea in this, that the Hiph. in contradistinction to &#1504;&#1495;&#1500; would denote an object of desire spontaneously sought for. But far stronger and more pointed is the heightening of the idea when we take &#1497;&#1499;&#1514;&#1512;&#1493; as the denom. of &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514; (Gr. &#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, &#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, Babyl. &#1499;&#1491;&#1512;, cudur, cf. &#1499;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, a rounding, sphaera).

The bibl. language has also (<a href="/psalms/142-8.htm">Psalm 142:8</a>) &#1492;&#1499;&#1514;&#1497;&#1512; in the denom. signification of to place a crown, and that on oneself; the non-bibl. has &#1502;&#1499;&#1514;&#1497;&#1512; (like the bibl. &#1502;&#1506;&#1496;&#1497;&#1512;) in the sense of distributor of crowns,<p>(Note: Vid., Wissenschaft, Kunst, Judenthum (1838), p. 240.)<p>and is fond of the metaphor &#1499;&#1514;&#1512; &#1492;&#1491;&#1506;&#1514;, crown of knowledge. With those not self-dependent (vid., regarding the plur. form of &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;, p. 56), who are swayed by the first influence, the issue is, without their willing it, that they become habitual fools: folly is their possession, i.e., their property. The prudent, on the contrary, as <a href="/proverbs/14-15.htm">Proverbs 14:15</a> designates them, have thoughtfully to ponder their step to gain knowledge as a crown (cf. &#1492;&#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1512;, to gain riches, &#1492;&#1508;&#1512;&#1497;&#1495;, 11b, to gain flowers, Gesen. 53, 2). Knowledge is to them not merely an inheritance, but a possession won, and as such remains with them a high and as it were a kingly ornament. </body></html>
