Sin is the shame of sinners; but wisdom is the honour of the wise. 19. Even bad men acknowledge the excellency of God's people. 20. Friendship in the world is governed by self-interest. It is good to have God our Friend; he will not desert us. 21. To despise a man for his employment or appearance is a sin. 22. How wisely those consult their own interest, who not only do good, but devise it! 23. Labour of the head, or of the hand, will turn to some good account. But if men's religion runs all out in talk and noise, they will come to nothing. 24. The riches of men of wisdom and piety enlarge their usefulness. 25. An upright man will venture the displeasure of the greatest, to bring truth to light. 26,27. Those who fear the Lord so as to obey and serve him, have a strong ground of confidence, and will be preserved. Let us seek to this Fountain of life, that we may escape the snares of death. 28. Let all that wish well to the kingdom of Christ, do what they can, that many may be added to his church. 29. A mild, patient man is one that learns of Christ, who is Wisdom itself. Unbridled passion is folly made known. 30. An upright, contented, and benevolent mind, tends to health. 31. To oppress the poor is to reproach our Creator. 32. The wicked man has his soul forced from him; he dies in his sins, under the guilt and power of them. But godly men, though they have pain and some dread of death, have the blessed hope, which God, who cannot lie, has given them. 33. Wisdom possesses the heart, and thus regulates the affections and tempers. 34. Piety and holiness always promote industry, sobriety, and honesty. 35. The great King who reigns over heaven and earth, will reward faithful servants who honour his gospel by the proper discharge of the duties of their stations: he despises not the services of the lowest.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Reproach - The word so rendered has this sense in the Targum of <a href="/leviticus/20-17.htm">Leviticus 20:17</a>.

Then is added, before the first verse of the next chapter, a paragraph which looks like an explanation of the present clause, or an introduction to ver. 1 of ch. 15.: "Anger destroyeth even the prudent." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/14.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>29 He that is slow to anger is rich in understanding; <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But he that is easily excited carries off folly.<p>&#1488;&#1512;&#1498; &#1488;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; (constr. of &#1488;&#1512;&#1498;) is he who puts off anger long, viz., the outbreak of anger, &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1498;, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/19-11.htm">Proverbs 19:11</a>, i.e., lets it not come in, but shuts it out long (&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  equals  &#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;, <a href="/james/1-19.htm">James 1:19</a>); and &#1511;&#1510;&#1512;&#1470;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;, he who in his spirit and temper, viz., as regards anger (for &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; denotes also the breathing out and snorting, <a href="/isaiah/25-4.htm">Isaiah 25:4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/33-11.htm">Isaiah 33:11</a>), is short, i.e., (since shortness of time is meant) is rash and suddenly (cf. quick to anger, praeceps in iram, 17a) breaks out with it, not &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; (but here &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;), as the lxx translate 17a. The former, who knows how to control his affections, shows himself herein as "great in understanding" (cf. <a href="/2_samuel/23-20.htm">2 Samuel 23:20</a>), or as a "man of great understanding" (Lat. multus prudenti); the contrary is he who suffers himself to be impelled by his affections into hasty, inconsiderate action, which is here expressed more actively by &#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;. Does this mean that he bears folly to the view (Luther, Umbreit, Bertheau, Elster, and others)? But for that idea the Mishle style has other expressions, <a href="/proverbs/12-23.htm">Proverbs 12:23</a>; <a href="/proverbs/13-16.htm">Proverbs 13:16</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/15-2.htm">Proverbs 15:2</a>, cf. <a href="/proverbs/14-17.htm">Proverbs 14:17</a>. Or does it mean that he makes folly high, i.e., shows himself highly foolish (lxx, Syr., Targum, Fleischer, and others)? But that would be expressed rather by &#1492;&#1490;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500; or &#1492;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492;. Or is it he heightens folly (Lwenstein, Hitzig)? But the remark that the angry ebullition is itself a gradual heightening of the foolish nature of such an one is not suitable, for the choleric man, who lets the evenness of his disposition be interrupted by a breaking forth of anger, is by no means also in himself a fool. Rashi is right when he says, &#1502;&#1508;&#1512;&#1497;&#1513;&#1492; &#1500;&#1495;&#1500;&#1511;&#1493;, i.e., (to which also Fleischer gives the preference) aufert pro portione sua stultitiam. The only appropriate parallel according to which it is to be explained, is <a href="/proverbs/3-35.htm">Proverbs 3:35</a>. But not as Ewald: he lifts up folly, which lies as it were before his feet on his life's path; but: he takes off folly, in the sense of <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/6-8.htm">Leviticus 6:8</a>, i.e., he carries off folly, receives a portion of folly; for as to others, so also to himself, when he returns to calm blood, that which he did in his rage must appear as folly and madness. </body></html>
