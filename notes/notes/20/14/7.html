Here are grace and sin in their true colours. Those that despise God's precepts and promises, despise God and all his power and mercy. 3. Pride grows from that root of bitterness which is in the heart. The root must be plucked up, or we cannot conquer this branch. The prudent words of wise men get them out of difficulties. 4. There can be no advantage without something which, though of little moment, will affright the indolent. 5. A conscientious witness will not dare to represent anything otherwise than according to his knowledge. 6. A scorner treats Divine things with contempt. He that feels his ignorance and unworthiness will search the Scriptures in a humble spirit. 7. We discover a wicked man if there is no savour of piety in his discourse. 8. We are travellers, whose concern is, not to spy out wonders, but to get to their journey's end; to understand the rules we are to walk by, also the ends we are to walk toward. The bad man cheats himself, and goes on in his mistake. 9. Foolish and profane men consider sin a mere trifle, to be made light of rather than mourned over. Fools mock at the sin-offering; but those that make light of sin, make light of Christ. 10. We do not know what stings of conscience, or consuming passions, torment the prosperous sinner. Nor does the world know the peace of mind a serious Christian enjoys, even in poverty and sickness. 11. Sin ruins many great families; whilst righteousness often raises and strengthens even mean families. 12. The ways of carelessness, of worldliness, and of sensuality, seem right to those that walk in them; but self-deceivers prove self-destroyers. See the vanity of carnal mirth. 14. Of all sinners backsliders will have the most terror when they reflect on their own ways. 15. Eager readiness to believe what others say, has ever proved mischievous. The whole world was thus ruined at first. The man who is spiritually wise, depends on the Saviour alone for acceptance. He is watchful against the enemies of his salvation, by taking heed to God's word. 16. Holy fear guards against every thing unholy. 17. An angry man is to be pitied as well as blamed; but the revengeful is more hateful.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Findeth it not - literally, there is none.

The Vulgate gives, <span class="accented">vade contra stultum</span>, which is probably to be taken in the sense of the Authorized Version. The Revised Version has, "Go into the presence of a foolish man." The Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e0;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5d2;&#x5b6;&#x5d3;</span> (<span class="accented">minneged</span>) may mean "from before," "over against," "in the presence of." Hence arises an ambiguity. The Authorized Version considers the sentence to be an injunction to turn away from a stupid man when you perceive that you can do him no good. The Revised Version is equivalent to "if you go into the presence," etc. <span class="cmt_word">When thou perceivest not in him the lips of knowledge;</span> Revised Version, <span class="accented">and thou shalt not perceive in him</span>, etc., which embodies a truism with no special point. The whole sentence is better translated, <span class="accented">Go forth from the presence of a foolish man, and thou hast not known the lips of knowledge</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, as Nowack explains, "Leave the presence of a fool, and you carry nothing away with you; after all your intercourse with him, you quit his presence without having gained any advance in true knowledge" (see on Proverbs 20:15). The LXX. presents a very different version: "All things are adverse to a foolish man; but wise lips are the arms of knowledge (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>)." A foolish man, by his inconsiderate, slanderous, or bitter words, makes every one his enemy; a wise man uses his knowledge to good purposes; his words are the instruments by which he shows what he is. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/14.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>1 The wisdom of the woman buildeth her house,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; And folly teareth it down with its own hands.<p>Were it &#1495;&#1499;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;, after <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/5-29.htm">Judges 5:29</a>, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/19-11.htm">Isaiah 19:11</a>, then the meaning would be: the wise among women, each of them buildeth her house. But why then not just &#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1492; &#1495;&#1499;&#1502;&#1492;, as <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-2.htm">2 Samuel 14:2</a>, cf. <a href="/exodus/35-25.htm">Exodus 35:25</a>? The Syr., Targum, and Jerome write sapiens mulier. And if the whole class must be spoken of, why again immediately the individualizing in &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1514;&#1492;? The lxx obliterates that by its &#x3c9;&#787;&#837;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;. And does not &#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514; [folly] in the contrasted proverb (1b) lead us to conclude on a similar abstract in 1a? The translators conceal this, for they translate &#1488;&#1493;&#1500;&#1514; personally. Thus also the Venet. and Luther; &#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514; is, says Kimchi, an adj. like &#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;, caeca. But the linguistic usage does not point &#1488;&#1493;&#1497;&#1500; with &#1488;&#1493;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497; to any &#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;. It is true that a fem. of &#1488;&#1493;&#1497;&#1500; does not occur; there is, however, also no place in which &#1488;&#1493;&#1500;&#1514; may certainly present itself as such. Thus also &#1495;&#1499;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; must be an abstr.; we have shown at <a href="/proverbs/1-20.htm">Proverbs 1:20</a> how &#1495;&#1499;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, as neut. plur., might have an abstr. meaning. But since it is not to be perceived why the poet should express himself so singularly, the punctuation &#1495;&#1499;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; is to be understood as proceeding from a false supposition, and is to be read &#1495;&#1499;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, as at <a href="/proverbs/9-1.htm">Proverbs 9:1</a> (especially since this passage rests on the one before us). Fleischer says: "to build the house is figuratively equivalent to, to regulate well the affairs of a house, and to keep them in a good condition; the contrary, to tear down the house, is the same contrast as the Arab. 'ama&#770;rat a&#770;lbyt and kharab albyt. Thus e.g., in Burckhardt's Sprchw. 217, harrt s&#803;abrt bytha&#770; 'ama&#770;rat, a good woman (ein braves Weib) has patience (with her husband), and thereby she builds up her house (at the same time an example of the use of the preterite in like general sentences for individualizing); also No. 430 of the same work: 'ama&#770;rat a&#770;lbyt wla khara&#770;bt, it is becoming to build the house, not to destroy it; cf. in the Thousand and One Nights, where a woman who had compelled her husband to separate from her says: a&#770;na a&#770;lty 'amalt hadha&#770; barwh&#803;y wa&#770;khrnt byty bnfsy. Burckhardt there makes the remark: 'ama&#770;rat a&#770;lbyt denotes the family placed in good circumstances - father, mother, and children all living together happily and peacefully." This conditional relation of the wife to the house expresses itself in her being named as house-wife (cf. Hausehre [ equals  honour of a house] used by Luther, <a href="/psalms/68-13.htm">Psalm 68:13</a>), to which the Talmudic &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497; ( equals  uxor mea) answers; the wife is noted for this, and hence is called &#1506;&#1497;&#1511;&#1512; &#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1514;, the root and foundation of the house; vid., Buxtorf's Lex. col. 301. In truth, the oneness of the house is more dependent on the mother than on the father. A wise mother can, if her husband be dead or neglectful of his duty, always keep the house together; but if the house-wife has neither understanding nor good-will for her calling, then the best will of the house-father cannot hinder the dissolution of the house, prudence and patience only conceal and mitigate the process of dissolution - folly, viz., of the house-wife, always becomes more and more, according to the degree in which this is a caricature of her calling, the ruin of the house. </body></html>
