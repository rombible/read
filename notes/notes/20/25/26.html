We take a wrong course if we think to relieve those in sorrow by endeavouring to make them merry. 21,22. The precept to love even our enemies is an Old Testament commandment. Our Saviour has shown his own great example in loving us when we were enemies. 23. Slanders would not be so readily spoken, if they were not readily heard. Sin, if it receives any check, becomes cowardly. 24. It is better to be alone, than to be joined to one who is a hinderance to the comfort of life. 25. Heaven is a country afar off; how refreshing is good news from thence, in the everlasting gospel, which signifies glad tidings, and in the witness of the Spirit with our spirits that we are God's children! 26. When the righteous are led into sin, it is as hurtful as if the public fountains were poisoned. 27. We must be, through grace, dead to the pleasures of sense, and also to the praises of men. 28. The man who has no command over his anger, is easily robbed of peace.

The mouth of the righteous should be "a well of life" (<a href="/proverbs/10-11.htm">Proverbs 10:11</a>), wholesome, refreshing, helpful; his conduct should be consistent and straightforward, fearless in upholding the right (<a href="/isaiah/51-12.htm">Isaiah 51:12</a>, etc.), uncompromising in opposing sin. When such a man, for fear, or favour, or weakness, or weariness, yields to the wicked, compromises principle, no longer makes a stand for truth and purity and virtue, he loses his high character, brings a scandal on religion, and lowers his own spiritual nature. It is this moral cowardice which Christ so sternly rebukes (<a href="/matthew/10-33.htm">Matthew 10:33</a>), "Whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven." Some have assumed that the gnome is concerned with a good man's fall into misfortune owing to the machinations of sinners; but in this case the comparison loses its force; such persecution would not disturb the purity or lower the character of the righteous man; it would rather enhance his good qualities, give occasion for their exercise and development, and therefore could not be described as fouling a pure spring. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/25.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The above proverb, which connects itself with <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/25-18.htm">Proverbs 25:18</a>, not only by the sound &#1512;&#1506;, but also by &#1513;&#1473;&#1503;, which is assonant with &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1493;&#1503;, is followed by another with the catchword &#1512;&#1506;:<p>20 He that layeth aside his coat on a day of frost, vinegar on nitre,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And he who welcomes with songs a dejected heart.<p>Is not this intelligible, sensible, ingenious? All these three things are wrong. The first is as wrong as the second, and the third, which the proverb has in view, is morally wrong, for one ought to weep with those that weep, <a href="/romans/12-15.htm">Romans 12:15</a>; he, on the contrary, who laughs among those who weep, is, on the most favourable judgment, a fool. That which is wrong in 20a, according to Bttcher in the Aehrenlese, 1849, consists in this, that one in severe cold puts on a fine garment. As if there were not garments which are at the same time beautiful, and keep warm? In the new Aehrenlese he prefers the reading &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;: if one changes his coat. But that surely he might well enough do, if the one were warmer than the other! Is it then impossible that &#1502;&#1506;&#1491;&#1492;, in the connection, means transire faciens  equals  removens? The Kal &#1506;&#1491;&#1492;, tarnsiit, occurs at <a href="/job/28-8.htm">Job 28:8</a>. So also, in the poetic style. &#1492;&#1506;&#1491;&#1492; might be used in the sense of the Aram. &#1488;&#1506;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;. Rightly Aquila, Symmachus, &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;; the Venet. better, &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; (Mid.). &#1489;&#1468;&#1490;&#1491; is an overcoat or mantle, so called from covering, as &#1500;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; (R. &#1500;&#1489;, to fasten, fix), the garment lying next the body, vid., at <a href="/psalms/22-19.htm">Psalm 22:19</a>. Thus, as it is foolish to lay off upper clothing on a frosty day, so it is foolish also to pour vinegar on nitre; carbonic acid nitre, whether it be mineral (which may be here thought of) or vegetable, is dissolved in water, and serves diverse purposes (vid., under <a href="/isaiah/1-25.htm">Isaiah 1:25</a>); but if one pours vinegar on it, it is destroyed. &#1500;&#1489;&#1470;&#1512;&#1506;<p>(Note: The writing wavers between &#1506;&#1500; &#1500;&#1489;&#1470;&#1512;&#1506; (cf. &#1506;&#1500; &#1506;&#1501;&#1470;&#1491;&#1468;&#1500;) and &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1489;&#1500; &#1512;&#1506; dna )&#1506;&#1500; &#1506;.)<p>is, at <a href="/proverbs/26-23.htm">Proverbs 26:23</a> and elsewhere, a heart morally bad, here a heart badly disposed, one inclined to that which is evil; for &#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1512; is the contrast of &#1511;&#1493;&#1504;&#1503; &#1511;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492;, and always the consequence of a disposition joyfully excited; the inconsistency lies in this, that one thinks to cheer a sorrowful heart by merry singing, if the singing has an object, and is not much more the reckless expression of an animated pleasure in view of the sad condition of another. &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1512; &#1506;&#1500; .rehtona  signifies, as at <a href="//biblehub.com/job/33-27.htm">Job 33:27</a>, to sing to any one, to address him in singing; cf. &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; &#1506;&#1500;, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-10.htm">Jeremiah 6:10</a>, and particularly &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1500;&#1489;, <a href="/hosea/2-16.htm">Hosea 2:16</a>; <a href="/isaiah/40-2.htm">Isaiah 40:2</a>. The &#1489; of &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; is neither the partitive, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/9-5.htm">Proverbs 9:5</a>, nor the transitive, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/20-30.htm">Proverbs 20:30</a>, but the instrumental; for, as e.g., at <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/7-20.htm">Exodus 7:20</a>, the obj. of the action is thought of as its means (Gesen. 138, Anm. 3*); one sings "with songs," for definite songs underlie his singing. The lxx, which the Syr., Targ., and Jerome more or less follow, has formed from this proverb one quite different: "As vinegar is hurtful to a wound, so an injury to the body makes the heart sorrowful; as the moth in clothes, and the worm in wood, so the sorrow of a man injures his heart." The wisdom of this pair of proverbs is not worth much, and after all inquiry little or nothing comes of it. The Targ. at least preserves the figure 20b: as he who pours vinegar (Syr. chalo) on nitre; the Peshito, however, and here and there also the Targum, has jathro (arrow-string) instead of methro (nitre). Hitzig adopts this, and changes the tristich into the distich:<p>He that meeteth archers with arrow on the string,<p>Is like him who singeth songs with a sad heart.<p>The Hebrew of this proverb of Hitzig's (&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1511;&#1512;&#1492; &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1497;&#1514;&#1512;) is unhebraic, the meaning dark as an oracle, and its moral contents nil.</body></html>
