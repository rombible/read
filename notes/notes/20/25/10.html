But it is the honour of rulers to search out matters, to bring to light hidden works of darkness. 4,5. For a prince to suppress vice, and reform his people, is the best way to support his government. 6,7. Religion teaches us humility and self-denial. He who has seen the glory of the Lord in Christ Jesus, will feel his own unworthiness. 8-10. To be hasty in beginning strife, will bring into difficulties. War must at length end, and might better be prevented. It is so in private quarrels; do all thou canst to settle the matter. 11,12. A word of counsel, or reproof, rightly spoken, is especially beautiful, as fine fruit becomes still more beautiful in silver baskets. 13. See what ought to be the aim of him that is trusted with any business; to be faithful. A faithful minister, Christ's messenger, should be thus acceptable to us. 14. He who pretends to have received or given that which he never had, is like the morning cloud, that disappoints those who look for rain. 15. Be patient to bear a present hurt. Be mild to speak without passion; for persuasive language is the most effectual to prevail over the hardened mind. 16. God has given us leave to use grateful things, but we are cautioned against excess.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>An anticipation of the highest standard of ethical refinement <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/18-15.htm">Matthew 18:15</a>, but with a difference.

Thus Siracides: "Whoso discovereth secrets loseth his credit; and shall never find friend to his mind. Love thy friend, and be faithful unto him: but if thou bewrayest his secrets, follow no more after him. For as a man hath destroyed his enemy; so hast thou lost the love of thy neighbour" (Ecclus. 27:16, etc.; comp. also 22:22). The motive presented in our text is not the highest, being grounded on the fear of shame and disgrace in men's eyes; but it is a very potent incentive to right action, and the moralist has good reason for employing it. That it does not reach to the height of Christian morality is obvious. The gnome is thus given in the Greek: "When thy friend shall reproach thee, retreat backward, despise him not, lest thy friend reproach thee still; and so thy quarrel and enmity shall not pass away, but shall be to thee like death." Then the LXX. adds a paragraph, reproduced partly by St. Jerome, "Kindness and friendship set a man free (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;</span>); preserve thou these, that thou become not liable to reproach (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">exprobabilis</span>); but guard thy ways in a conciliating spirit (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>)." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/25.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>There now follows an emblematic (vid., vol. i. p. 10) tetrastich:<p>4 Take away the dross from silver,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; So there is ready a vessel for the goldsmith;<p>5 Take away the wicked from the king,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; And his throne is established by righteousness.<p>The form &#1492;&#1490;&#1493; (cf. the inf. Poal &#1492;&#1490;&#1493;, <a href="/isaiah/59-13.htm">Isaiah 59:13</a>) is regarded by Schultens as showing a ground-form &#1492;&#1490;&#1493;; but there is also found e.g., &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;, whose ground-form is &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;; the verb &#1492;&#1490;&#1492;, R. &#1492;&#1490; (whence Arab. hajr, discedere), cf. &#1497;&#1490;&#1492; (whence &#1492;&#1490;&#1492;, semovit, <a href="/2_samuel/20-13.htm">2 Samuel 20:13</a>  equals  Syr. a&#770;wagy, cf. Arab. a&#770;wjay, to withhold, to abstain from), signifies to separate, withdraw; here, of the separation of the &#1505;&#1497;&#1490;&#1497;&#1501;, the refuse, i.e., the dross (vid., regarding the plena scriptio, Baer's krit. Ausg. des Jesaia, under <a href="/proverbs/1-22.htm">Proverbs 1:22</a>); the goldsmith is designated by the word &#1510;&#1512;&#1507;, from &#1510;&#1512;&#1507; morf, to turn, change, as he who changes the as yet drossy metal by means of smelting, or by purification in water, into that which is pure. In 5a &#1492;&#1490;&#1492; is, as at <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/27-8.htm">Isaiah 27:8</a>, transferred to a process of moral purification; what kind of persons are to be removed from the neighbourhood of the king is shown by <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/1-22.htm">Isaiah 1:22-23</a>. Here also (as at Isa. l.c.) the emblem or figure of <a href="/proverbs/25-4.htm">Proverbs 25:4</a> is followed in <a href="/proverbs/25-5.htm">Proverbs 25:5</a> by its moral antitype aimed at. The punctuation of both verses is wonderfully fine and excellent. In <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/25-4.htm">Proverbs 25:4</a>, &#1493;&#1497;&#1510;&#1488; is not pointed &#1493;&#1497;&#1510;&#1488;, but as the consecutive modus &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1510;&#1488;; this first part of the proverb refers to a well-known process of art: the dross is separated from the silver (inf. absol., as <a href="/proverbs/12-7.htm">Proverbs 12:7</a>; <a href="/proverbs/15-22.htm">Proverbs 15:22</a>), and so a vessel (utensil) proceeds from the goldsmith, for he manufactures pure silver; the &#1500; is here similarly used as the designation of the subject in the passive, <a href="/proverbs/13-13.htm">Proverbs 13:13</a>; <a href="/proverbs/14-20.htm">Proverbs 14:20</a>. In <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/25-5.htm">Proverbs 25:5</a>, on the contrary, &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1503; (&#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1503;) is not the punctuation used, but the word is pointed indicatively &#1493;&#1497;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1503;; this second part of the proverb expresses a moral demand (inf. absol. in the sense of the imperative, Gesen. 131, 4b like <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/17-12.htm">Proverbs 17:12</a>, or an optative or concessive conjunction): let the godless be removed, &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497; &#1502;&#1500;&#1498;, i.e., not from the neighbourhood of the king, for which the words are &#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497; &#1502;&#1500;&#1498;; also not those standing before the king, i.e., in his closest neighbourhood (Ewald, Bertheau); but since, in the absolute, &#1492;&#1490;&#1492;, not an act of another in the interest of the king, but of the king himself, is thought of: let the godless be removed from before the king, i.e., because he administers justice (Hitzig), or more generally: because after that Psalm (101), which is the "mirror of princes," he does not suffer him to come into his presence. Accordingly, the punctuation is &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1468;&#1491;&#1511;, not &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1491;&#1511; (<a href="/proverbs/16-12.htm">Proverbs 16:12</a>); because such righteousness is meant as separates the &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; from it and itself from him, as <a href="/isaiah/16-5.htm">Isaiah 16:5</a> (vid., Hitzig), where the punctuation of &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1505;&#1491; denotes that favour towards Moab seeking protection. </body></html>
