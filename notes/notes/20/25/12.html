But it is the honour of rulers to search out matters, to bring to light hidden works of darkness. 4,5. For a prince to suppress vice, and reform his people, is the best way to support his government. 6,7. Religion teaches us humility and self-denial. He who has seen the glory of the Lord in Christ Jesus, will feel his own unworthiness. 8-10. To be hasty in beginning strife, will bring into difficulties. War must at length end, and might better be prevented. It is so in private quarrels; do all thou canst to settle the matter. 11,12. A word of counsel, or reproof, rightly spoken, is especially beautiful, as fine fruit becomes still more beautiful in silver baskets. 13. See what ought to be the aim of him that is trusted with any business; to be faithful. A faithful minister, Christ's messenger, should be thus acceptable to us. 14. He who pretends to have received or given that which he never had, is like the morning cloud, that disappoints those who look for rain. 15. Be patient to bear a present hurt. Be mild to speak without passion; for persuasive language is the most effectual to prevail over the hardened mind. 16.

As a golden earring, when first put on, gives pain and uneasiness; but, being well hung and fixed, is very ornamental, being of fine gold, and especially when any jewels are upon it; which may be meant by the ornament, as the word is rendered, Sol 7:1; <p>so is a wise reprover upon an obedient ear; such is the reproof of a wise man, which is seasonably given, in a fit and proper manner; and which appears to proceed from love, and is designed for good, and done in great affection and faithfulness: this, though it may be a little grating to the ear at first, yet, when well considered and received, instead of leaving any infamy or reproach on the person reproved, it is an ornament to him, as well as reflects honour upon the reprover. It may be rendered, "so is he that reproveth a wise man, upon" or "with an obedient ear" (g); a wise man that has an obedient or hearing ear, who is so wise as to altered to reproofs given him, and which he takes kindly, and receives profit and advantage from them; see <a href="/proverbs/9-8.htm">Proverbs 9:8</a>. <p>(g)  "qui arguit sapientem", V.

Vulgate, <span class="accented">Inauris aurea et margaritum fulgens</span>, "A golden earring and a brilliant pearl." Septuagint, "A golden earring a precious sardius also is set." So is a wise reprover upon an obedient ear. The obedient ear receives the precepts of the wise reprover, and wears them as a valued ornament. In <a href="/proverbs/1-9.htm">Proverbs 1:9</a> the instruction of parents is compared to a chaplet on the head and a fair chain on the neck.

The Hithpa. &#1492;&#1514;&#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1512; is like the reflex forms <a href="/proverbs/12-9.htm">Proverbs 12:9</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/13-7.htm">Proverbs 13:7</a>, for it signifies to conduct oneself as &#1492;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; or &#1504;&#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1512; (vid., <a href="/proverbs/20-29.htm">Proverbs 20:29</a>), to play the part of one highly distinguished. &#1506;&#1502;&#1491; has, 6b, its nearest signification: it denotes, not like &#1504;&#1510;&#1468;&#1489;, standing still, but approaching to, e.g., <a href="/jeremiah/7-2.htm">Jeremiah 7:2</a>. The reason given in <a href="/proverbs/25-7.htm">Proverbs 25:7</a> harmonizes with the rule of wisdom, <a href="/luke/14-10.htm">Luke 14:10</a>.: better is the saying to thee, i.e., that one say to thee (Ewald, 304b), &#1506;&#1500;&#1492; &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; (so the Olewejored is to be placed), &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b9; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; (thus in Luke), than that one humble thee &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497; &#1504;&#1491;&#1497;&#1489;, not: because of a prince (Hitzig), for &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497; nowhere means either pro (<a href="/proverbs/17-18.htm">Proverbs 17:18</a>) or propter, but before a prince, so that thou must yield to him (cf. <a href="/proverbs/14-19.htm">Proverbs 14:19</a>), before him whom thine eyes had seen, so that thou art not excused if thou takest up the place appropriate to him. Most interpreters are at a loss to explain this relative. Luther: "which thine eyes must see," and Schultens: ut videant oculi tui. Michaelis, syntactically admissible: quem videre gestiverunt oculi tui, viz., to come near to him, according to Bertheau, with the request that he receives some high office. Otherwise Fleischer: before the king by whom thou and thine are seen, so much the more felt is the humiliation when it comes upon one after he has pressed so far forward that he can be perceived by the king. But &#1504;&#1491;&#1497;&#1489; is not specially the king, but any distinguished personage whose place he who has pressed forward has taken up, and from which he must now withdraw when the right possessor of it comes and lays claim to his place. &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; is never used in poetry without emphasis. Elsewhere it is equivalent to &#1504;&#1514;&#1504;&#1513;, quippe quem, here equivalent to &#1512;&#1508;&#1504;&#1513;, quem quidem. Thine eyes have seen him in the company, and thou canst say to thyself, this place belongs to him, according to his rank, and not to thee - the humiliation which thou endurest is thus well deserved, because, with eyes to see, thou wert so blind. The lxx, Syr., Symmachus (who reads 8a, &#1500;&#1512;&#1489;, &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;), and Jerome, refer the words "whom thine eyes had seen" to the proverb following; but &#1488;&#1513;&#1512; does not appropriately belong to the beginning of a proverb, and on the supposition that the word &#1500;&#1512;&#1489; is generally adopted, except by Symmachus, they are also heterogeneous to the following proverb: </body></html>
