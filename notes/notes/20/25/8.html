But it is the honour of rulers to search out matters, to bring to light hidden works of darkness. 4,5. For a prince to suppress vice, and reform his people, is the best way to support his government. 6,7. Religion teaches us humility and self-denial. He who has seen the glory of the Lord in Christ Jesus, will feel his own unworthiness. 8-10. To be hasty in beginning strife, will bring into difficulties. War must at length end, and might better be prevented. It is so in private quarrels; do all thou canst to settle the matter. 11,12. A word of counsel, or reproof, rightly spoken, is especially beautiful, as fine fruit becomes still more beautiful in silver baskets. 13. See what ought to be the aim of him that is trusted with any business; to be faithful. A faithful minister, Christ's messenger, should be thus acceptable to us. 14. He who pretends to have received or given that which he never had, is like the morning cloud, that disappoints those who look for rain. 15. Be patient to bear a present hurt. Be mild to speak without passion; for persuasive language is the most effectual to prevail over the hardened mind. 16. God has given us leave to use grateful things, but we are cautioned against excess.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The general meaning is: It is dangerous to plunge into litigation.

The Heb. as it stands is forcible in its abruptness: <span class="bld">Lest—what wilt thou do in the end thereof?</span> &c.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">8–10</span>. The admonition in these verses is general: Be not of a contentious spirit; plunge not hastily into quarrels (comp. the use of the same word “strive,” <a href="/genesis/26-20.htm" title="And the herdsmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac's herdsmen, saying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well Esek; because they strove with him.">Genesis 26:20</a>; <a href="/exodus/21-18.htm" title="And if men strive together, and one smite another with a stone, or with his fist, and he die not, but keeps his bed:">Exodus 21:18</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/33-8.htm" title="And of Levi he said, Let your Thummim and your Urim be with your holy one, whom you did prove at Massah, and with whom you did strive at the waters of Meribah;">Deuteronomy 33:8</a>). But there is a special and perhaps primary reference to <span class="ital">going to law</span> (obs. <span class="ital">thy cause, <a href="/proverbs/25-9.htm" title="Debate your cause with your neighbor himself; and discover not a secret to another:">Proverbs 25:9</a></span>, the same Heb. word as in <a href="/context/exodus/23-2.htm" title="You shall not follow a multitude to do evil; neither shall you speak in a cause to decline after many to wrest judgment:...">Exodus 23:2-3</a>). The passage will then nearly resemble our Lord’s teaching: so far from “going forth hastily to strive,” “agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him”; show a placable disposition, and instead of seeking the publicity of the law-court, “debate thy cause with thy neighbour himself.” And do this from a consideration of what litigation persisted in may involve: lest thou know not what to do,” &c.; “lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge,” &c. <a href="/context/matthew/5-25.htm" title="Agree with your adversary quickly, whiles you are in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and you be cast into prison....">Matthew 5:25-26</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - A tristich with no parallelism. <span class="cmt_word">Go not forth hastily to strive.</span> The idea is either of one entering into litigation with undue haste, or of one hurrying to meet an adversary. St. Jerome, taking in the final words of the previous verse, renders, <span class="accented">Quae viderunt oculi tui</span>, <span class="accented">ne proferas in jurgio cito</span>, "What thine eyes have seen reveal not hastily in a quarrel." This is like Ver. 9 below, and Christ's injunction, "If thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone" (<a href="/matthew/18-15.htm">Matthew 18:15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Lest thou know not what to do in the end thereof.</span> The Hebrew is elliptical, "Lest by chance (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b6;&#x5df;</span>) thou do something (bad, humiliating) in the end thereof." But Delitzsch, Nowack, and others consider the sentence as interrogative (as <a href="/1_samuel/20-19.htm">1 Samuel 20:19</a>), and translate, "That it may not be said in the end thereof, What wilt thou do?" Either way, the warning comes to this - Do not enter hastily upon strife of any kind, lest thou be utterly at a loss what to do. When thy neighbour hath put thee to shame, by putting thee in the wrong, gaining his cause, or getting the victory over thee in some way. Septuagint, "Fall not quickly into a contest, lest thou repent at the last." There is an English proverb, "Anger begins with folly and ends with repentance;" and "Haste is the beginning of wrath, its end is repentance." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/25.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>It is characteristic of the purpose of the book that it begins with proverbs of the king:<p>It is the glory of God to conceal a thing;<p>And the glory of the king to search out a matter.<p>That which is the glory of God and the glory of the king in itself, and that by which they acquire glory, stand here contrasted. The glory of God consists in this, to conceal a matter, i.e., to place before men mystery upon mystery, in which they become conscious of the limitation and insufficiency of their knowledge, so that they are constrained to acknowledge, <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-28.htm">Deuteronomy 29:28</a>, that "secret things belong unto the Lord our God." There are many things that are hidden and are known only to God, and we must be contented with that which He sees it good to make known to us.<p>(Note: Cf. von Lasaulx, Philosophie der Geschichte, p. 128f.: "God and Nature love to conceal the beginning of things.")<p>The honour of kings, on the contrary, who as pilots have to steer the ship of the state (<a href="/proverbs/11-14.htm">Proverbs 11:14</a>), and as supreme judges to administer justice (<a href="/1_kings/3-9.htm">1 Kings 3:9</a>), consists in this, to search out a matter, i.e., to place in the light things that are problematical and subjects of controversy, in conformity with their high position, with surpassing intelligence, and, in conformity with their responsibility, with conscientious zeal. The thought that it is the glory of God to veil Himself in secrecy (<a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/55-1.htm">Isaiah 55:1-13</a> :15; cf. <a href="/1_kings/8-12.htm">1 Kings 8:12</a>), and of the king, on the contrary, not to surround himself with an impenetrable nimbus, and to withdraw into inaccessible remoteness - this thought does not, immediately at least, lie in the proverb, which refers that which is concealed, and its contrary, not to the person, but to a matter. Also that God, by the concealment of certain things, seeks to excite to activity human research, is not said in this proverb; for 2b does not speak of the honour of wise men, but of kings; the searching out, 2b, thus does not refer to that which is veiled by God. But since the honour of God at the same time as the welfare of men, and the honour of the king as well as the welfare of his people, is to be thought of, the proverb states that God and the king promote human welfare in very different ways - God, by concealing that which sets limits to the knowledge of man, that he may not be uplifted; and the king, by research, which brings out the true state of the matter, and thereby guards the political and social condition against threatening danger, secret injuries, and the ban of offences unatoned for. This proverb, regarding the difference between that which constitutes the honour of God and of the king, is followed by one which refers to that in which the honour of both is alike. </body></html>
