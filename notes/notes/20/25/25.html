Confidence in an unfaithful man is painful and vexatious; when we put any stress on him, he not only fails, but makes us feel for it. 20. We take a wrong course if we think to relieve those in sorrow by endeavouring to make them merry. 21,22. The precept to love even our enemies is an Old Testament commandment. Our Saviour has shown his own great example in loving us when we were enemies. 23. Slanders would not be so readily spoken, if they were not readily heard. Sin, if it receives any check, becomes cowardly. 24. It is better to be alone, than to be joined to one who is a hinderance to the comfort of life. 25. Heaven is a country afar off; how refreshing is good news from thence, in the everlasting gospel, which signifies glad tidings, and in the witness of the Spirit with our spirits that we are God's children! 26. When the righteous are led into sin, it is as hurtful as if the public fountains were poisoned. 27. We must be, through grace, dead to the pleasures of sense, and also to the praises of men. 28. The man who has no command over his anger, is easily robbed of peace.

Water is naturally cold; and is by classic writers expressed by "cold" itself (c), and is very refreshing to one athirst through heat: or, "to a weary soul" (d); to one wearied with labour; or to a traveller weary with travelling, especially in hot countries, as in the deserts of Arabia, or in places where it is rare to meet with a brook, stream, or fountain of water; which, when he does, it is exceeding pleasant and agreeable to him; <p>so is good news from a far country; so acceptable is it to hear from a friend in a distant part of the world, and particularly to hear good news of him. Such is the Gospel; it is good news, and glad tidings of good things; it brings the good news of the grace, and favour, and good will of God to men; of his appointment and provision of a Saviour for them; of the incarnation of Christ; of salvation being wrought out by him for the chief of sinners, which is free, full, and for ever; and of peace, pardon, righteousness, and eternal life, through him, And this comes "from a far country"; from heaven, the better country than Canaan, which was a type of it, or any country in this world, and which is afar from hence; the Gospel comes from God in heaven, and it is a report concerning that; it is good news to saints, of an estate they have there, an inheritance, a house, a city and kingdom prepared for them there: this news is brought by the prophets of the Old Testament, who diligently inquired of salvation by Christ; by the angels at Christ's incarnation; by John the Baptist, the forerunner of Christ; by Christ himself, who was anointed to preach good tidings to the meek; and by his apostles, and all the faithful ministers of the word: and the message they bring is good news; not to carnal and self-righteous persons, but to sensible sinners; and to them it is as cold waters to a weary or thirsty soul; it assuages the heat of the law, and the wrath that works in the conscience; it quenches the thirst of carnal things, and after a man's own righteousness; it revives and refreshes his weary drooping spirits, and fills him with a joy unspeakable and full of glory; as Jacob's spirits were revived on hearing the good news of Joseph, <a href="/genesis/45-26.htm">Genesis 45:26</a>. <p>(c) "Perfundit gelida", Horat.

The relief to the latter, when they receive good news of the wanderer, is as refreshing as a draught of cool water to a fainting, weary man. We do not know that the Hebrews were great travellers in those days; but any communication from a distant country would be very uncertain in arriving at its destination, and would at any rate take a long time in transmission, in most cases there would be nothing to rest upon but vague report, or a message carried by some travelling merchant. There is a somewhat similar proverb found at Ver. 13 and <a href="/proverbs/15-30.htm">Proverbs 15:30</a>. The ancient commentators have seen in this news from a distant country the announcement of Christ's birth by the angels at Bethlehem, or the preaching of the gospel that tells of the joys of heaven, the land that is very far off (<a href="/isaiah/33-17.htm">Isaiah 33:17</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/25.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>19 A worthless tooth and an unsteady foot - <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trust in a faithless man in the day of need.<p>The form &#1512;&#1506;&#1492; (with Mercha on the antepenult), <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/29-19.htm">Isaiah 29:19</a>, takes the place of an inf. absol.; &#1512;&#1506;&#1492; here (about the tone syllable of which Dech does not decide, thus without doubt Milra) is certainly not a subst.: tooth of breaking (Gesen.); for how strange such a designation of a worthless tooth! &#1513;&#1473;&#1503; is indeed mas. in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-5.htm">1 Samuel 14:5</a>, but it can also be used as fem., as &#1512;&#1490;&#1500;, which is for the most part fem., also occurs as mas., Gttche. 650. Bttcher, in the new Aehrenlese, and in the Lehrbuch, takes &#1512;&#1506;&#1492; as fem. of an adj. &#1512;&#1506;, after the form &#1495;&#1500;; but &#1495;&#1500; is not an adj., and does not form a fem., although it means not merely profanity, but that which is profane; this is true also of the Aram. &#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;; for &#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1488;, <a href="//biblehub.com/esther/2-9.htm">Esther 2:9</a>, Targ., is a female name mistaken by Buxtorf. Are we then to read &#1512;&#1506;&#1492;, with Hitzig, after the lxx? - an unimportant change. We interpret the traditional &#1512;&#1506;&#1492;, with Fleischer, as derived from &#1512;&#1493;&#1506;&#1506;&#1492;, from &#1512;&#1493;&#1506;&#1506;, breaking to pieces (crumbling), in an intransitive sense. The form &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1491;&#1514; is also difficult. Bttcher regards it as also, e.g., Aben Ezra after the example of Gecatilia as part. Kal.  equals  &#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491;&#1514;, "only on account of the pausal tone and the combination of the two letters &#1502;&#1506; with  instead of ." But this vocal change, with its reasons, is merely imaginary. &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1491;&#1514; is the part. Pual, with the preformative &#1502; struck out, Ewald 169d. The objection that the part. Pual should be &#1502;&#1502;&#1506;&#1491;, after the form &#1502;&#1489;&#1506;&#1512;, does not prove anything to the contrary; for &#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491;&#1514; cannot be the fem. so as not to coincide with the fem. of the part. Kal, cf. besides to the long  the form without the Dagesh &#1497;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="/ecclesiastes/9-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:12</a>  equals  &#1502;&#1497;&#1511;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; (Arnheim, Gramm. p. 139). &#1512;&#1490;&#1500; &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1491;&#1514; is a leg that has become tottering, trembling. He who in a time of need makes a faithless man his ground of confidence, is like one who seeks to bite with a broken tooth, and which he finally crushes, and one who supports himself on a shaking leg, and thus stumbles and falls. The gen. connection &#1502;&#1489;&#1496;&#1495; &#1489;&#1493;&#1490;&#1491; signifies either the ground of confidence consisting in a faithless man, or the confidence placed in one who is faithless. But, after the Masora, we are to read here, as at <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/65-6.htm">Psalm 65:6</a>, &#1502;&#1489;&#1496;&#1495;, which Michlol 184a also confirms, and as it is also found in the Venice 1525, Basel 1619, and in Norzi. This &#1502;&#1489;&#1496;&#1492; is constr. according to Kimchi, notwithstanding the Kametz; as also &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1500;, <a href="/ezra/8-30.htm">Ezra 8:30</a> (after Abulwald, Kimchi, and Norzi). In this passage before us, &#1502;&#1489;&#1496;&#1495; &#1489;&#1493;&#1490;&#1491; may signify a deceitful ground of confidence (cf. <a href="/habakkuk/2-5.htm">Habakkuk 2:5</a>), but the two other passages present a genit. connection of the words. We must thus suppose that the a&#772; of &#1502;&#1489;&#1496;&#1495; and &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1500;, in these three passages, is regarded as fixed, like the  of the form (Arab.) mif'a&#770;l.</body></html>
