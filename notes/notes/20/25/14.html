But it is the honour of rulers to search out matters, to bring to light hidden works of darkness. 4,5. For a prince to suppress vice, and reform his people, is the best way to support his government. 6,7. Religion teaches us humility and self-denial. He who has seen the glory of the Lord in Christ Jesus, will feel his own unworthiness. 8-10. To be hasty in beginning strife, will bring into difficulties. War must at length end, and might better be prevented. It is so in private quarrels; do all thou canst to settle the matter. 11,12. A word of counsel, or reproof, rightly spoken, is especially beautiful, as fine fruit becomes still more beautiful in silver baskets. 13. See what ought to be the aim of him that is trusted with any business; to be faithful. A faithful minister, Christ's messenger, should be thus acceptable to us. 14. He who pretends to have received or given that which he never had, is like the morning cloud, that disappoints those who look for rain. 15. Be patient to bear a present hurt. Be mild to speak without passion; for persuasive language is the most effectual to prevail over the hardened mind. 16.

It may very well be applied to false teachers, who boast of their gifts and spiritual knowledge, when they have none; speaking great swelling words of vanity, when they are empty of all that is good, and are as follow: <p>is like like clouds and wind without rain; which make a show and appearance of rain, promise much, but produce none; see <a href="//biblehub.com/2_peter/2-17.htm">2 Peter 2:17</a>, Jde 1:12. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/25.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Whoever boasteth himself of a false gift <i>is like</i> <span class="cverse3">{k}</span> clouds and wind without rain.</span><p>(k) Which have an outward appearance, and are nothing within.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/25.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">14</span>.

The proverb is concerned with promises disappointed. Clouds and wind are generally in the East the precursors of heavy rain, as we read in <a href="/1_kings/18-45.htm">1 Kings 18:45</a>, "In a little while the heaven was black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain." After  such phenomena, which, according to current meteorological observation, gave every hope of a refreshing shower in the time of summer drought, to see the clouds pass away without affording a single drop of rain is a grievous disappointment. The metaphor is found in the New Testament. St. Jude (Ver. 12) calls false teachers "clouds without water, carried along by winds." "A gift of falsehood," equivalent to "a false gift," one that deceives, because it is only promised and never given. A man makes a great parade of going to bestow a handsome present, and then sneaks out of it, and gives nothing. Such a one is, as St. Jerome renders, <span class="accented">Vir gloriosus</span>, <span class="accented">et promissa non complens</span>. The old commentators quote Ovid, 'Heroid.,' 6:509 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Mobilis AEsonide, vernaque incertior aura,<br />Cur tua pollicito pondere verba carent?"</span> Deeds are fruits, says the proverb, "words are but leaves;" and "Vainglory blossoms, but never bears fruit." Concerning the folly of making stupid boasts, the Bengalee proverb speaks of a pedlar in ginger getting tidings of his ship. The Septuagint is incorrect, "As winds, and clouds, and rains are most evident (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>), so is he who boasts of a false gift." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/25.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>8 Go not forth hastily to strife,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; That it may not be said, "What wilt thou do in the end thereof,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; When now thy neighbour bringeth disgrace upon thee?"<p>9 Art thou striving with thy neighbour? strive with him,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; But disclose not the secret of another;<p>10 That he who heareth it may not despise thee,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; And thine evil name depart no more.<p>Whether &#1512;&#1497;&#1489; in &#1500;&#1512;&#1497;&#1489; is infin., as at <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/21-22.htm">Judges 21:22</a>, or subst., as at <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/19-8.htm">2 Chronicles 19:8</a>, is not decided: ad litigandum and ad litem harmonize. As little may it be said whether in &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1514;&#1468;&#1510;&#1488; [go not forth], a going out to the gate (court of justice), or to the place where he is to be met who is to be called to account, is to be thought of; in no respect is the sense metaphorical: let not thyself transgress the bounds of moderation, ne te laisse pas emporter; &#1497;&#1510;&#1488; &#1500;&#1512;&#1489; is correlate to &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1488; &#1500;&#1512;&#1493;&#1489;, <a href="/judges/21-22.htm">Judges 21:22</a>. The use of &#1508;&#1468;&#1503; in 8b is unprecedented. Euchel and Lwenstein regard it as an imper.: reflect upon it (test it); but &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; does not signify this, and the interjectional &#1492;&#1505; does not show the possibility of an imper. Kal &#1508;&#1468;&#1503;, and certainly not &#1508;&#1468;&#1503; (&#1508;&#1468;&#1503;). The conj. &#1508;&#1468;&#1503; is the connecting form of an original subst. ( equals  panj), which signifies a turning away. It is mostly connected with the future, according to which Nolde, Oetinger, Ewald, and Bertheau explain &#1502;&#1492; indefinite, something, viz., unbecoming. In itself, it may, perhaps, be possible that &#1508;&#1503; &#1502;&#1492; was used in the sense of ne quid (Venet. &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769; &#x3c4;&#x3b9;); but "to do something," for "to commit something bad," is improbable; also in that case we would expect the words to be thus: &#1508;&#1503; &#1514;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1502;&#1492;. Thus &#1502;&#1492; will be an interrogative, as at <a href="/1_samuel/20-10.htm">1 Samuel 20:10</a> (vid., Keil), and the expression is brachyogical: that thou comest not into the situation not to know what thou oughtest to do (Rashi: &#1508;&#1503; &#1514;&#1489;&#1488; &#1500;&#1497;&#1491;&#1497; &#1500;&#1488; &#1514;&#1491;&#1506; &#1492;&#1501; &#1500;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1514;), or much rather anakoluth.; for instead of saying &#1508;&#1468;&#1503;&#1470;&#1500;&#1488; &#1514;&#1491;&#1506; &#1502;&#1492;&#1470;&#1500;&#1468;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1514;, the poet, shunning this unusual &#1508;&#1503; &#1500;&#1488;, adopts at once the interrogative form: that it may not be said at the end thereof (viz., of the strife); what wilt thou do? (Umbreit, Stier, Elster, Hitzig, and Zckler). This extreme perplexity would occur if thy neighbour (with whom thou disputest so eagerly and unjustly) put thee to shame, so that thou standest confounded (&#1499;&#1500;&#1501;, properly to hurt, French blesser). If now the summons 9a follows this warning against going out for the purpose of strife: fight out thy conflict with thy neighbour, then &#1512;&#1497;&#1489;&#1498;, set forth with emphasis, denotes not such a strife as one is surprised into, but that into which one is drawn, and the tuam in causam tuam is accented in so far as 9b localizes the strife to the personal relation of the two, and warns against the drawing in of an &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;, i.e., in this case, of a third person: and expose not the secret of another &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1514;&#1468;&#1490;&#1500; (after Michlol 130a, and Ben-Bileam, who places the word under the '&#1508;'&#1508;&#1514;&#1495;&#1497;&#1503; &#1489;&#1505;, is vocalized with Pathach on &#1490;, as is Cod. 1294, and elsewhere in correct texts). One ought not to bring forward in a dispute, as material of proof and means of acquittal, secrets entrusted to him by another, or secrets which one knows regarding the position and conduct of another; for such faithlessness and gossiping affix a stigma on him who avails himself of them, in the public estimation, <a href="/proverbs/25-10.htm">Proverbs 25:10</a>; that he who hears it may not blame thee (&#1495;&#1505;&#1468;&#1491;  equals  Aram. &#1495;&#1505;&#1468;&#1491;, vid., under <a href="/proverbs/14-34.htm">Proverbs 14:34</a>), and the evil report concerning thee continue without recall. Fleischer: ne infamia tua non recedat i.e., nunquam desinat per ora hominum propagari, with the remark, "in &#1491;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492;, which properly means in stealthy creeping on of the rumour, and in &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; lies a (Arab.) tarshyh&#803;," i.e., the two ideas stand in an interchangeable relation with a play upon the words: the evil rumour, once put in circulation, will not again retrace its steps; but, on the contrary, as Virgil says:<p>Mobilitate viget viresque acquirit eundo.<p>In fact, every other can sooner rehabilitate himself in the public estimation that he who is regarded as a prattler, who can keep no secret, or as one so devoid of character that he makes public what he ought to keep silent, if he can make any use of it in his own interest. In regard to such an one, the words are continually applicable, hic niger est, hunc tu, Romane, caveto, <a href="/proverbs/20-19.htm">Proverbs 20:19</a>. The lxx has, instead of &#1493;&#1491;&#1489;&#1514;&#1498; 10b, read &#1493;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1489;&#1514;&#1498;, and translated it with the addition of a long appendix: "They quarrel, and hostilities will not cease, but will be to thee like death. Kindness and friendship deliver, let these preserve thee, that thou mayest not become one meriting reproaches (Jerome: ne exprobrabilis fias), but guard thy ways, &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;." </body></html>
