We take a wrong course if we think to relieve those in sorrow by endeavouring to make them merry. 21,22. The precept to love even our enemies is an Old Testament commandment. Our Saviour has shown his own great example in loving us when we were enemies. 23. Slanders would not be so readily spoken, if they were not readily heard. Sin, if it receives any check, becomes cowardly. 24. It is better to be alone, than to be joined to one who is a hinderance to the comfort of life. 25. Heaven is a country afar off; how refreshing is good news from thence, in the everlasting gospel, which signifies glad tidings, and in the witness of the Spirit with our spirits that we are God's children! 26.

To which sense agrees the Vulgate Latin version, <p>"so he who is the searcher of majesty shall be oppressed by glory;'' <p>he shall be bore down by it, and not able to bear the glory of it: and the Targum is, <p>"to eat much honey is not good, nor to search glorious words.'' <p>Jarchi takes the words in this sense; and illustrates them by the work of creation, Ezekiel's vision of the wheels, the decrees of God, and the reasons of them. <p>(e) Suidas in voce  (f) "Vitiosum est ubique quod nimium est", Seneca de Tranquilitate, c. 9.

The ill effects of a surfeit of honey have been already mentioned (Ver. 16); but here the application is different, and occasions some difficulty. The Authorized Version, in order to clear up the obscurity of the text, inserts a negative, <span class="cmt_word">So for men to search their own glory is not glory,</span> which seems to be a warning against conceit and self-adulation. This is hardly warranted by the present Hebrew text, which is literally, as Venetian renders, <span class="greek">&#x1f1c;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;</span>, "The search of their glory [is] glory." But who are meant by "their"? No persons are mentioned in the verse to whom the suffix in <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> can be referred, and it is not improbable that some words have dropped out of the text. At the same time, we might naturally in thought supply "for men" after "it is not good," such omissions being not uncommon in proverbial sayings; the suffix then would refer to them. Commentators have endeavoured to amend the text by alterations which do not commend themselves. Schultens supposes that the suffix had reference to the Divine law and revelations, and, as <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5d1;&#x5d3;</span> may mean both "glory" and "weight," translates, "Vestigatio gravitatis eorum, gravitas." Bertheau takes <span class="accented">kabod</span> in two different senses, "The searching out of their glory is a burden." So Delitzsch, by little manipulation of the pointing (<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span>) obtains the rendering, "But to search out hard things is an honour." Taken thus, the maxim says that bodily pleasures sicken and cloy, but diligent study brings honour. This, however, is not satisfactory; it gives a word two different senses in the same clause, and it affords a very feeble contrast. One would naturally expect the proverb to say that the excess, which was deprecated in the first hemistich as regards one department, must be equally rejected in another sphere. This is somewhat the idea given by Jerome, <span class="accented">Sic qui scrutator est majestatis opprimetur a gloria</span>. The truth here stated will be explained by translating our text, "The investigation of weighty matters is a weight." Thus the clauses are shown to be well poised. Honey is good, study is good; but both may be used so as to be prejudicial. Eating may be carried to excess; study may attempt to investigate things too hard or too high. That this is a real danger we know well from the controversies about  predestination and elation in time past, and those concerning spiritualism and theurgy in our own day (see Jeremy Taylor, 'Certainty of Salvation,' 3:176, edit. Hebrews; and 'Holy Living,' ch. 3, &sect; 5). This is the view taken of the passage by St. Gregory ('Moral,' 14:32), 'If the sweetness of honey be taken in greater measure than there is occasion for, from the same source whence the palate is gratified, the life of the eater is destroyed.' The "searching into majesty" is also sweet; but he that seeks to dive into it deeper than the cognizance of human nature admits, finds the mere gloriousness thereof by itself oppresses him, in that, like honey taken in excess, it bursts the sense of the searcher which is not capable of holding it." And again (ibid., 20:18), "For the glory of the invisible Creator, which when searched into with moderation lifts us up, being dived into beyond our powers bears us down" (Oxford transl.). (Comp. <a href="/deuteronomy/29-29.htm">Deuteronomy 29:29</a>; Ecclus. 3:21, etc.) Septuagint, "To eat much honey is not good, but it behoves us to honor glorious sayings." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/25.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>21 If thine enemy hunger, feed him with bread;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And if he thirst, give him water to drink.<p>22 For thereby thou heapest burning coals on his head,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Jahve will recompense it to thee.<p>The translation of this proverb by the lxx is without fault; Paul cites therefrom <a href="/romans/12-20.htm">Romans 12:20</a>. The participial construction of 22a, the lxx, rightly estimating it, thus renders: for, doing this, thou shalt heap coals on his head. The expression, "thou shalt heap" (&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;), is also appropriate; for &#1495;&#1514;&#1492; certainly means first only to fetch or bring fire (vid., <a href="/proverbs/6-27.htm">Proverbs 6:27</a>); but here, by virtue of the constructio praegnans with &#1506;&#1500;, to fetch, and hence to heap up - to pile upon. Burning pain, as commonly observed, is the figure of burning shame, on account of undeserved kindness shown by an enemy (Fleischer). But how burning coals heaped on the head can denote burning shame, is not to be perceived, for the latter is a burning on the cheeks; wherefore Hitzig and Rosenmller explain: thou wilt thus bring on him the greatest pain, and appease thy vengeance, while at the same time Jahve will reward thy generosity. Now we say, indeed, that he who rewards evil with good takes the noblest revenge; but if this doing of good proceed from a revengeful aim, and is intended sensibly to humble an adversary, then it loses all its moral worth, and is changed into selfish, malicious wickedness. Must the proverb then be understood in this ignoble sense? The Scriptures elsewhere say that guilt and punishment are laid on the head of any one when he is made to experience and to bear them. Chrysostom and others therefore explain after <a href="/psalms/140-10.htm">Psalm 140:10</a> and similar passages, but thereby the proverb is morally falsified, and <a href="/proverbs/25-22.htm">Proverbs 25:22</a> accords with <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/25-21.htm">Proverbs 25:21</a>, which counsels not to the avenging of oneself, but to the requital of evil with good. The burning of coals laid on the head must be a painful but wholesome consequence; it is a figure of self-accusing repentance (Augustine, Zckler), for the producing of which the showing of good to an enemy is a noble motive. That God rewards such magnanimity may not be the special motive; but this view might contribute to it, for otherwise such promises of God as <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/58-8.htm">Isaiah 58:8-12</a> were without moral right. The proverb also requires one to show himself gentle and liberal toward a needy enemy, and present a twofold reason for this: first, that thereby his injustice is brought home to his conscience; and, secondly, that thus God is well-pleased in such practical love toward an enemy, and will reward it; - by such conduct, apart from the performance of a law grounded in our moral nature, one advances the happiness of his neighbour and his own. </body></html>
