Christ himself is Wisdom, is Wisdoms. Three sorts of persons are here called by Him: 1. Simple ones. Sinners are fond of their simple notions of good and evil, their simple prejudices against the ways of God, and flatter themselves in their wickedness. 2. Scorners. Proud, jovial people, that make a jest of every thing. Scoffers at religion, that run down every thing sacred and serious. 3. Fools. Those are the worst of fools that hate to be taught, and have a rooted dislike to serious godliness. The precept is plain; Turn you at my reproof. We do not make a right use of reproofs, if we do not turn from evil to that which is good. The promises are very encouraging. Men cannot turn by any power of their own; but God answers, Behold, I will pour out my Spirit unto you. Special grace is needful to sincere conversion. But that grace shall never be denied to any who seek it. The love of Christ, and the promises mingled with his reproofs, surely should have the attention of every one. It may well be asked, how long men mean to proceed in such a perilous path, when the uncertainty of life and the consequences of dying without Christ are considered? Now sinners live at ease, and set sorrow at defiance; but their calamity will come. Now God is ready to hear their prayers; but then they shall cry in vain. Are we yet despisers of wisdom? Let us hearken diligently, and obey the Lord Jesus, that we may enjoy peace of conscience and confidence in God; be free from evil, in life, in death, and for ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This is no arbitrary sentence.

This sentiment of retributive punishment also found expression in Terence, "Tute hoc intristi, tibi omne est edendum" ('Phorm.,' 2. 1. 4). When we are punished, the blameworthiness lies not with God, but with us sinners (Wardlaw). <span class="cmt_word">They shall be filled;</span> rather, <span class="accented">satiated</span>, or <span class="accented">surfeited</span>; <span class="accented">saturabuntur</span> (Vulgate).

Gesenius has inaccurately interpreted the phrase &#1508;&#1512;&#1506; &#1512;&#1488;&#1513; of the shaving off of the hair, instead of the letting it fly loose. &#1508;&#1512;&#1506; means to loosen ( equals  to lift up, syn. &#1492;&#1495;&#1500;), to release, to set free; it combines the meanings of loosening and making empty, or at liberty, which is conveyed in Arab. by fr' and frg. The latter means, intrans., to be set free, therefore to be or to become free from occupation or business; with mn of an object, to be free from it, i.e., to have accomplished it, to have done with it (Fl.). Thus: since ye have dismissed (missum fecistis) all my counsel (&#1506;&#1510;&#1492; as &#1500;&#1491;&#1492;, from &#1497;&#1506;&#1509;, Arabic w'd), i.e., what I always would advise to set you right. &#1488;&#1489;&#1492; combines in itself the meanings of consent, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/1-10.htm">Proverbs 1:10</a>, and compliance, <a href="/proverbs/1-30.htm">Proverbs 1:30</a> (with &#1500;), and, as here, of acceptance.
