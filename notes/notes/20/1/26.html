Christ himself is Wisdom, is Wisdoms. Three sorts of persons are here called by Him: 1. Simple ones. Sinners are fond of their simple notions of good and evil, their simple prejudices against the ways of God, and flatter themselves in their wickedness. 2. Scorners. Proud, jovial people, that make a jest of every thing. Scoffers at religion, that run down every thing sacred and serious. 3. Fools. Those are the worst of fools that hate to be taught, and have a rooted dislike to serious godliness. The precept is plain; Turn you at my reproof. We do not make a right use of reproofs, if we do not turn from evil to that which is good. The promises are very encouraging. Men cannot turn by any power of their own; but God answers, Behold, I will pour out my Spirit unto you. Special grace is needful to sincere conversion. But that grace shall never be denied to any who seek it. The love of Christ, and the promises mingled with his reproofs, surely should have the attention of every one. It may well be asked, how long men mean to proceed in such a perilous path, when the uncertainty of life and the consequences of dying without Christ are considered? Now sinners live at ease, and set sorrow at defiance; but their calamity will come. Now God is ready to hear their prayers; but then they shall cry in vain. Are we yet despisers of wisdom? Let us hearken diligently, and obey the Lord Jesus, that we may enjoy peace of conscience and confidence in God; be free from evil, in life, in death, and for ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Compare the marginal reference. The scorn and derision with which men look on pride and malice, baffled and put to shame, has something that answers to it in the Divine Judgment. It is, however, significant that in the fuller revelation of the mind and will of the Father in the person of the Son no such language meets us.

The terrific nature of the punishment of the wicked is marked by a succession of terms all of terrible import - calamity, fear, desolation, destruction, distress, and anguish (vers. 26, 27). When these come upon them, then Wisdom will laugh and have them in derision. The verbs "laugh" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;</span>, <span class="accented">sakhak</span>) and "mock" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5d0;&#x5d0;&#x5dc;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5d2;</span>) are the same as in <a href="/psalms/2-4.htm">Psalm 2:4</a>, where they are rendered "to mock" and "have in derision." <span class="cmt_word">When your fear cometh;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> has actually arrived. <span class="accented">Fear</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span> <span class="accented">pakhad</span>); here used metonymically for that which causes the fear or terror (<span class="accented">id, quod timebatis</span>, Vulgate).

The termination u&#770;th is here, by the passing over of the u into the less obscure but more intensive o (cf. &#1497;&#1492;&#1493; in the beginning and middle of the word, and &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493; at the end of the word), raised to o&#770;th, and thereby is brought near to the fem. plur. (cf. &#1495;&#1499;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/14-1.htm">Proverbs 14:1</a>, sapientia, as our plur. of the neut. sapiens, &#1495;&#1499;&#1502;&#1492;), approaching to the abstract. On the other hand, that &#1495;&#1499;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; is sing. of abstract signification, is not decisively denoted by its being joined to the plur. of the predicate (for &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; here, as at <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/8-3.htm">Proverbs 8:3</a>, is scarcely plur.; and if &#1512;&#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/24-7.htm">Proverbs 24:7</a>, is plur., &#1495;&#1499;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; as the numerical plur. may refer to the different sciences or departments of knowledge); but perhaps by this, that it interchanges with &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/49-4.htm">Psalm 49:4</a>, cf. <a href="/proverbs/11-12.htm">Proverbs 11:12</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/28-16.htm">Proverbs 28:16</a>, and that an abstract formation from &#1495;&#1499;&#1502;&#1492; (fem. of &#1495;&#1499;&#1501;, &#1495;&#1499;&#1501;), which besides is not concrete, was unnecessary. Still less is &#1495;&#1499;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;  equals  &#1495;&#1499;&#1502;&#1514; a singular, which has it in view to change &#1495;&#1499;&#1502;&#1492; into a proper name, for proof of which Hitzig refers to &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, <a href="/psalms/78-15.htm">Psalm 78:15</a>; the singular ending o&#770;th without an abstract signification does not exist. After that Dietrich, in his Abhandl. 1846, has shown that the origin of the plur. proceeds not from separate calculation, but from comprehension,<p>(Note: In the Indo-Germanic languages the s of the plur. also probably proceeds from the prep. sa (sam)  equals  &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;. See Schleicher, Compend. der vergl. Gram. 247.)<p>and that particularly also names denoting intellectual strength are frequently plur., which multiply the conception not externally but internally, there is no longer any justifiable doubt that &#1495;&#1499;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; signifies the all-comprehending, absolute, or, as Bttcher, 689, expresses it, the full personal wisdom. Since such intensive plurals are sometimes united with the plur. of the predicate, as e.g., the monotheistically interpreted Elohim, <a href="/genesis/35-7.htm">Genesis 35:7</a> (see l.c.), so &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; may be plur. On the other hand, the idea that it is a forma mixta of &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1503; (from &#1512;&#1504;&#1503;) and &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1504;&#1492; (<a href="/job/39-23.htm">Job 39:23</a>) or &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;, the final sound in ah opposes. It may, however, be the emphatic form of the 3rd fem. sing. of &#1512;&#1504;&#1503;; for, that the Hebr. has such an emphatic form, corresponding to the Arab. taktubanna, is shown by these three examples (keeping out of view the suspicion of a corruption of the text, Olsh. p. 452), <a href="/judges/5-26.htm">Judges 5:26</a>; <a href="/job/17-16.htm">Job 17:16</a>; <a href="/isaiah/28-3.htm">Isaiah 28:3</a>; cf. &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495;&#1504;&#1492;, <a href="/obadiah/1-13.htm">Obadiah 1:13</a> (see Caspari, l.c.), an example of the 2nd masc. sing. of this formation. &#1512;&#1504;&#1503; (with &#1512;&#1504;&#1492;) is a word imitative of sound (Schallwort), used to denote "a clear-sounding, shrill voice (thence the Arab. rannan, of a speaker who has a clear, piercing voice); then the clear shrill sound of a string or chord of a bow, or the clear tinkle of the arrow in the quiver, and of the metal that has been struck" (Fl.). The meaning of &#1512;&#1495;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; is covered by plateae (<a href="/luke/14-21.htm">Luke 14:21</a>), wide places; and &#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509;, which elsewhere may mean that which is without, before the gates of the city and courts, here means the "open air," in contradistinction to the inside of the houses. </body></html>
