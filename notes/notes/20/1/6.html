The end of the wise and intelligent man's increase in learning and prudence is that he may be thus enabled to understand other proverbs. Schultens, followed by Holden, takes the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">l'havin</span>) as a gerund, <span class="accented">intelligendo sententias.</span> This rendering does not represent the end, but points to the proverbs, etc., as means by which the wise generally attain to learning and prudence. <span class="cmt_word">And the interpretation;</span> Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">m'litsah</span>). It is difficult to determine the exact meaning of this word. By Gesenius it is rendered "enigma, riddle;" by Bertheau and Hitzig, "discourse requiring  interpretation:" by Delitzsch, "symbol; by Havernick and Keil, "brilliant and pleasing discourse;" and by Fuerst, "figurative and involved discourse." By comparing it with the corresponding words, "dark sayings," it may be regarded as designating that which is obscure and involved in meaning; compare <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (LXX.). It only occurs here and in <a href="/habakkuk/2-6.htm">Habakkuk 2:6</a>, where it is rendered "taunting proverb." The marginal reading is "an eloquent speech," equivalent to <span class="accented">facundia</span>, "eloquence." Vatablus says that the Hebrews understood it as "mensuram et pondus verbi." <span class="cmt_word">The words of the wise;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the utterances of the <span class="accented">khakhamim</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>). This expression occurs again in <a href="/proverbs/22-17.htm">Proverbs 22:17</a>, and also in <a href="/ecclesiastes/9.htm">Ecclesiastes 9</a>:19 and Ecclesiastes 12:11. In the latter they are described as "goads and as nails fastened by the ministers of assemblies" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> "authors of compilations," as Mendelssohn), because they cannot fail to make an impression on everybody good or bad. The expression, as used in <a href="/proverbs/22-17.htm">Proverbs 22:17</a>, implies that other than Solomonic proverbs are included in this collection. <span class="cmt_word">And their dark sayings;</span> Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;&#x5b9;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">v'khidotham</span>). The Hebrew <span class="accented">khidah</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>), as <span class="accented">m'litsah</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>)# its parallel in the preceding hemistich, designates obscure, involved utterances. It plainly has the sense of "enigma" (Fleischer, apud Delitzsch). Compare <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> (LXX.), and <span class="accented">aenigmata</span> (Vulgate), which latter is followed by the Chaldea Paraphrase and Syriac (see also <a href="/psalms/78-2.htm">Psalm 78:2</a>, "I will open my mouth in parables, I will utter <span class="accented">dark sayings</span> of old"). Gesenius derives it from the root <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d3;</span> (<span class="accented">khud</span>), "to tie knots," and hence arrives at its meaning as an involved or twisted sententious expression, an <span class="accented">enigma.</span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/150.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The call to praise has thus far been addressed to persons not mentioned by name, but, as the names of instruments thus heaped up show, to Israel especially. It is now generalized to "the totality of breath," i.e., all the beings who are endowed by God with the breath of lie (Heb.: &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1514; &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;), i.e., to all mankind.<p>With this full-toned Finale the Psalter closes. Having risen as it were by five steps, in this closing Psalm it hovers over the blissful summit of the end, where, as Gregory of Nyssa says, all creatures, after the disunion and disorder caused by sin have been removed, are harmoniously united for one choral dance (&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;), and the chorus of mankind concerting with the angel chorus are become one cymbal of divine praise, and the final song of victory shall salute God, the triumphant Conqueror (&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#837;), with shouts of joy. There is now no need for any special closing beracha. This whole closing Psalm is such. Nor is there any need even of an Amen (<a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/106-48.htm">Psalm 106:48</a>, cf. <a href="/1_chronicles/16-36.htm">1 Chronicles 16:36</a>). The Hallelujah includes it within itself and exceeds it. </body></html>
