Christ himself is Wisdom, is Wisdoms. Three sorts of persons are here called by Him: 1. Simple ones. Sinners are fond of their simple notions of good and evil, their simple prejudices against the ways of God, and flatter themselves in their wickedness. 2. Scorners. Proud, jovial people, that make a jest of every thing. Scoffers at religion, that run down every thing sacred and serious. 3. Fools. Those are the worst of fools that hate to be taught, and have a rooted dislike to serious godliness. The precept is plain; Turn you at my reproof. We do not make a right use of reproofs, if we do not turn from evil to that which is good. The promises are very encouraging. Men cannot turn by any power of their own; but God answers, Behold, I will pour out my Spirit unto you. Special grace is needful to sincere conversion. But that grace shall never be denied to any who seek it. The love of Christ, and the promises mingled with his reproofs, surely should have the attention of every one. It may well be asked, how long men mean to proceed in such a perilous path, when the uncertainty of life and the consequences of dying without Christ are considered? Now sinners live at ease, and set sorrow at defiance; but their calamity will come. Now God is ready to hear their prayers; but then they shall cry in vain. Are we yet despisers of wisdom? Let us hearken diligently, and obey the Lord Jesus, that we may enjoy peace of conscience and confidence in God; be free from evil, in life, in death, and for ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Turning - Wisdom had called the simple to "turn," and they had turned, but it was "away" from her.

Some render it, as Aben Ezra, "the rest" or "quietness of the simple" (k), &amp;c. taking up their rest in themselves, and in their observance of ceremonies and traditions; and crying Peace, peace, when sudden destruction was at hand: or a stubborn hardened rest in sin, a seared conscience; having no sense of guilt, nor fear of punishment; living in carnal security till death should seize upon them; <p>and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them; that is, the abuse of it; leading them to commit sins, which bring destruction upon them; or, seeing sinners live with impunity, and prosper in the world, take encouragement from thence to indulge themselves in sin, which is their ruin; or, being in prosperity, think it will always be well with them, and therefore put away the evil day far from them, which comes upon them at an unawares; which was the case of the Jews. <p>(k) "requies", Vatablus, Baynus, Mercerus, Gejerus; "quies", Junius &amp; Tremellius; so some in Ben Melech. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.</span><p>(a) That is, the prosperity and sensuality in which they delight.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">32</span>. <span class="ital">turning away</span>] Lit. <span class="bld">turning</span>.

Abea Ezra understands it to signify "ease," as in the marginal reading; but there seems no warrant for taking the word in that sense. The LXX. renders the passage quite differently, <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x20;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f20;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span> "For because they wronged the young, they shall be slain;" so also the Arabic.

So Dathe translates, "Incuria ignavorum eos perdit." The Chaldee Paraphrase and Syriac Versions read "error." It occurs in a good sense as "tranquillity," "security," in <a href="/proverbs/17-1.htm">Proverbs 17:1</a> and <a href="/psalms/122-7.htm">Psalm 122:7</a>. The derivation of the word is  from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">shalah</span>). "to be tranquil, to be safe, secure." Marines remarks that it is more difficult to bear prosperity than adversity, because we endure adversity, we are corrupted by prosperity, and prosperity or ease makes fools mad. The false security of the prosperous is illustrated by our Lord in his parable of the rich fool (<a href="/luke/12-16.htm">Luke 12:16-21</a>). The LXX. differs again from the Hebrew in the second clause of this verse, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the carefully considered judgment of God concerning them shall destroy them.

Regarding &#1488;&#1497;&#1491;, calamitas opprimens, obruens (from &#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;  equals  Arabic a&#770;da, to burden, to oppress), see at <a href="/psalms/31-12.htm">Psalm 31:12</a>. &#1489;&#1488; is related to &#1497;&#1488;&#1514;&#1492; as arriving to approaching; &#1508;&#1495;&#1491;&#1468;&#1499;&#1501; is not that for which they are in terror - for those who are addressed are in the condition of carnal security - but that which, in the midst of this, will frighten and alarm them. The Cheth&#305;&#770;b &#1513;&#1488;&#1493;&#1492; is pointed thus, &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1492; (from &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;  equals  &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1492;, as &#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1492;, &#1494;&#1506;&#1493;&#1492; after the form &#1488;&#1492;&#1489;&#1492;, &#1491;&#1468;&#1488;&#1489;&#1492;); the Ker&#305;&#770; substitutes for this infinitive name the usual particip. &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1492; (where then the Vav is &#1497;&#1514;&#1497;&#1512;, "superfluous"), crashing (fem. of &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1492;), then a crash and an overthrow with a crash; regarding its root-meaning (to be waste, and then to sound hollow), see under <a href="/psalms/35-8.htm">Psalm 35:8</a>. &#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1492; (from &#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507;  equals  &#1505;&#1508;&#1492;), sweeping forth as a (see <a href="/proverbs/10-25.htm">Proverbs 10:25</a>) whirlwind. The infinitive construction of 27a is continued in 27b in the finite. "This syntactical and logical attraction, by virtue of which a modus or tempus passes by &#1493; or by the mere parallel arrangement (as <a href="/proverbs/2-2.htm">Proverbs 2:2</a>) from one to another, attracted into the signification and nature of the latter, is peculiar to the Hebr. If there follows a new clause or section of a clause where the discourse takes, as it were, a new departure, that attraction ceases, and the original form of expression is resumed; cf. 1:22, where after the accent Athnach the future is returned to, as here in 27c the infinitive construction is restored" (Fl.). The alliterating words &#1510;&#1512;&#1492; &#1493;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511;&#1492;, cf. <a href="/isaiah/30-6.htm">Isaiah 30:6</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-15.htm">Zephaniah 1:15</a>, are related to each other as narrowness and distress (Hitzig); the Mashal is fond of the stave-rhyme.<p>(Note: Jul. Ley, in his work on the Metrical Forms of Hebrew Poetry, 1866, has taken too little notice of these frequently occurring alliteration staves; Lagarde communicated to me (8th Sept. 1846) his view of the stave-rhyme in the Book of Proverbs, with the remark, "Only the Hebr. technical poetry is preserved to us in the O.T. records; but in such traces as are found of the stave-rhyme, there are seen the echoes of the poetry of the people, or notes passing over from it.") </body></html>
