Christ himself is Wisdom, is Wisdoms. Three sorts of persons are here called by Him: 1. Simple ones. Sinners are fond of their simple notions of good and evil, their simple prejudices against the ways of God, and flatter themselves in their wickedness. 2. Scorners. Proud, jovial people, that make a jest of every thing. Scoffers at religion, that run down every thing sacred and serious. 3. Fools. Those are the worst of fools that hate to be taught, and have a rooted dislike to serious godliness. The precept is plain; Turn you at my reproof. We do not make a right use of reproofs, if we do not turn from evil to that which is good. The promises are very encouraging. Men cannot turn by any power of their own; but God answers, Behold, I will pour out my Spirit unto you. Special grace is needful to sincere conversion. But that grace shall never be denied to any who seek it. The love of Christ, and the promises mingled with his reproofs, surely should have the attention of every one. It may well be asked, how long men mean to proceed in such a perilous path, when the uncertainty of life and the consequences of dying without Christ are considered? Now sinners live at ease, and set sorrow at defiance; but their calamity will come. Now God is ready to hear their prayers; but then they shall cry in vain. Are we yet despisers of wisdom? Let us hearken diligently, and obey the Lord Jesus, that we may enjoy peace of conscience and confidence in God; be free from evil, in life, in death, and for ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This is no arbitrary sentence.

Between <a href="/proverbs/1-23.htm">Proverbs 1:23</a> and <a href="/proverbs/1-24.htm">Proverbs 1:24</a> there is a pause, as between <a href="/isaiah/1-20.htm">Isaiah 1:20</a> and <a href="/isaiah/1-21.htm">Isaiah 1:21</a>. In vain Wisdom expects that her complaints and enticements will be heard. Therefore she turns her call to repentance into a discourse announcing judgment.<p>24 Because I have called, and ye refused;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stretched out my hand, and no man regarded;<p>25 And ye have rejected all my counsel<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And to my reproof have not yielded:<p>26 Therefore will I also laugh at your calamity,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will mock when your terror cometh;<p>27 When like a storm your terror cometh,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And your destruction swept on like a whirlwind;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When distress and anguish cometh upon you.<p>Commencing with &#1497;&#1506;&#1503; (which, like &#1502;&#1506;&#1503;, from &#1506;&#1504;&#1492;, to oppose, denotes the intention, but more the fundamental reason or the cause than, as &#1500;&#1502;&#1506;&#1503;, the motive or object), the clause, connected with &#1490;&#1468;&#1501;&#1470;&#1488;&#1504;&#1497;, ego vicissim, turns to the conclusion. As here &#1497;&#1506;&#1503; &#1511;&#1512;&#1488;&#1514;&#1497; (as the word of Jahve) are connected by &#1490;&#1468;&#1501;&#1470;&#1488;&#1504;&#1497; to the expression of the talio in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/66-4.htm">Isaiah 66:4</a>, so also &#1502;&#1488;&#1501;, with its contrast &#1488;&#1489;&#1492;, <a href="/isaiah/1-19.htm">Isaiah 1:19</a>. The construction quoniam vocavi et renuistis for quoniam quum vocarem renuistis (cf. <a href="/isaiah/12-1.htm">Isaiah 12:1</a>) is the common diffuse (zerstreute) Semitic, the paratactic instead of the periodizing style. The stretching out of the hand is, like the "spreading out" in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/65-2.htm">Isaiah 65:2</a>, significant of striving to beckon to the wandering, and to bring them near. Regarding &#1492;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489;, viz., &#1488;&#1494;&#1504;&#1493;, to make the ear still (R. &#1511;&#1513;), arrigere, incorrectly explained by Schultens, after the Arab k&#803;ashab, polire, by aurem purgare, vid., Isaiah, p. 257, note.</body></html>
