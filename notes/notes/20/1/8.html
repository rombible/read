In <a href="/psalms/111-10.htm">Psalm 111:10</a> it comes as the choral close of a temple hymn. Here it is the watchword of a true ethical education.

The form of appeal, <span class="ital">My son</span>, which is continually repeated throughout these opening chapters, strikes the key-note of the strain in which all the succeeding exhortations and counsels are cast. It indicates not only the fatherly relation which the Teacher assumes towards the young and inexperienced whom he has undertaken to instruct, but also the true source and authority of the teaching he will give them. The Law, though not clothed, as we have seen (<span class="ital">Introd</span>. pp. 12, 13) in this Book in its Jewish garb, is recognised in its eternal principles. “The instruction of the father,” and “the law of the mother” are to be accepted with childlike submission and unquestioning obedience, and will lend grace and dignity to the life and character, because and in so far as they are the instruction and the law of God Himself, the Universal Father, and because parents are His vicegerents in the education of their children (comp. <a href="/context/proverbs/6-20.htm" title="My son, keep your father's commandment, and forsake not the law of your mother:...">Proverbs 6:20-21</a>). And every true teacher is, in measure and degree, His and their deputy and representative. (See <a href="/deuteronomy/4-9.htm" title="Only take heed to yourself, and keep your soul diligently, lest you forget the things which your eyes have seen, and lest they depart from your heart all the days of your life: but teach them your sons, and your sons' sons;">Deuteronomy 4:9</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/6-7.htm" title="And you shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise up.">Deuteronomy 6:7</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/11-19.htm" title="And you shall teach them your children, speaking of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, when you lie down, and when you rise up.">Deuteronomy 11:19</a>; and compare the place of the 5th commandment in the Decalogue, as the link or hinge between the 1st and 2nd tables of the Law, and the extended obligation of that commandment to “governors, teachers, spiritual pastors and masters.”)<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8-19.</span> - 1. <span class="accented">First admonitory discourse. Warning against enticements to robbery and bloodshed.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My son, hear the instruction of thy father</span>. The transition in this verse from what may be regarded as filial obedience towards God to filial obedience towards parents is suggestive of the moral Law. The same admonition, in a slightly altered form, occurs again in ch. 6, "My son, keep thy father's commandment, and forsake not the law of thy mother" (cf. also <a href="/proverbs/4-1.htm">Proverbs 4:1</a>). <span class="accented">My son</span>; <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5d9;</span> (<span class="accented">b'ni</span>) from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">ben</span>), "a son." The form of address here adopted was that in common use by teachers towards their pupils, and marks that superintending, loving, and fatherly care and interest which the former felt in and towards the latter. It occurs frequently in the introductory section (<a href="/proverbs/2-1.htm">Proverbs 2:1</a>; <a href="/proverbs/3-1.htm">Proverbs 3:1, 21</a>; <a href="/proverbs/4-10.htm">Proverbs 4:10, 20</a>; <a href="/proverbs/5-1.htm">Proverbs 5:1</a>; <a href="/proverbs/6-1.htm">Proverbs 6:1</a>; <a href="/proverbs/7-1.htm">Proverbs 7:1</a>), and reappears again towards the close (<a href="/proverbs/23-15.htm">Proverbs 23:15, 19, 26</a>; <a href="/proverbs/24-13.htm">Proverbs 24:13, 21</a>; <a href="/proverbs/27-11.htm">Proverbs 27:11</a>) in the teacher's address. The mother of Lemuel uses it (<a href="/proverbs/31-2.htm">Proverbs 31:2</a>) in the strictly parental sense. In other passages of the Old Testament the teacher, on the other hand, is represented as a "father" (<a href="/judges/17-10.htm">Judges 17:10</a> <a href="/isaiah/10-12.htm">Isaiah 10:12</a>; <a href="/2_kings/2-21.htm">2 Kings 2:21</a>). We find the same relation assumed in the New Testament, both by St. Paul (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-15.htm">1 Corinthians 4:15</a>; <a href="/philemon/1-10.htm">Philemon 1:10</a>; <a href="/galatians/4-19.htm">Galatians 4:19</a>) and by St. John (<a href="/1_john/2-1.htm">1 John 2:1</a>; <a href="/1_john/5-2.htm">1 John 5:2</a>); but under the economy of the gospel it has a deeper significance than here, as pointing to the "new birth," which, being a later revelation, lies outside the scope of the moral teaching of the Old Testament dispensation. <span class="accented">The instruction</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b6;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e1;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> <span class="accented">musar</span>); as carrying with it the sense of disciplinary education (cf. LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">disciplina</span>; see also ver. 2), and of the correction with which it may be enforced (cf. <a href="/proverbs/13-24.htm">Proverbs 13:24</a>; <a href="/proverbs/22-15.htm">Proverbs 22:15</a>; <a href="/proverbs/23-13.htm">Proverbs 23:13, 14</a>), the writer attributes appropriately to the father, while the milder <span class="accented">torah</span>, "law," he uses of the mother (Delitzsch). <span class="accented">Father</span>. The nature of the exhortation conveyed in this verse requires that we should understand the terms "father" and "mother" in their natural sense as designating the parents of the persons addressed,  though a symbolical meaning has Been attached to them by the rabbis (see Rabbi Salomon, <span class="accented">in loc</span>.), "father" being understood as representing God, and "mother," the people. But the terms are more than merely figurative expressions (Stuart). Those who look upon the Proverbs as the address of Solomon to his son Rehoboam naturally take "father" as standing for the former. Naamah, in this case must be the mother (<a href="/1_kings/14-31.htm">1 Kings 14:31</a>). It is almost unnecessary to state that pious parents are presupposed, and that only that instruction and law can be meant which is not inconsistent with the higher and more perfect Law of God (Gejerus, Wardlaw). <span class="cmt_word">And forsake not the law of thy mother.</span> <span class="accented">Forsake.</span> The radical meaning of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d8;&#x5bc;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> (<span class="accented">tittosh</span>) is that of "spreading," then of "scattering" (Aiken), and so the word comes to mean "forsake, reject, or neglect." The LXX. reads <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;</span>, from <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;</span>, <span class="accented">abjicere</span>, "to push away, reject." Cf. <span class="accented">abjicias</span> (Arabic). The Vulgate has <span class="accented">dimittas, i.e.</span> "abandon," and the Syriac, <span class="accented">obliviscaris, i.e.</span> "forget." <span class="accented">The law</span>; <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span> (<span class="accented">torath</span>), construct case of <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">torah</span>), from the root <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">yarah</span>), "to teach," hence here equivalent to "a law" in the sense of that which teaches - a precept (<span class="accented">doctrina</span>, Jun. et Tremell., Piscat., Castal., Versions). With one exception (<a href="/proverbs/8-10.htm">Proverbs 8:10</a>), it is the term which always expresses the instruction given by Wisdom (Delitzsch). The law (<span class="accented">torah</span>) of the mother is that preceptive teaching which she imparts orally to her son, but <span class="accented">torah</span> is also used in a technical sense as <span class="accented">lex</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, that which is laid down and established, a <span class="accented">decretum</span> or <span class="accented">institutum</span>, and designates some distinct provision or ordinance, as the law of sacrifice (<a href="/leviticus/6-7.htm">Leviticus 6:7</a>). In <a href="/joshua/1-8.htm">Joshua 1:8</a> we find it employed to signify the whole body of the Mosaic Law (<span class="accented">sepher hatorah</span>)<span class="accented">. Mother.</span> Not inserted here as a natural expansion of the idea of the figure required by the laws of poetic parallelism (as Zockler), since this weakens the force of the passage. Mothers are mentioned because of their sedulousness in imparting instruction (Bayne). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Now follows the statement of the object which these proverbs subserve; and first, in general,<p>To become acquainted with wisdom and instruction,<p>To understand intelligent discourses.<p>They seek on the one side to initiate the reader in wisdom and instruction, and on the other to guide him to the understanding of intelligent discourses, for they themselves contain such discourses in which there is a deep penetrating judgment, and they sharpen the understanding of him who engages his attention with them.<p>(Note: &#1500;&#1491;&#1506;&#1514; is rightly pointed by Lwenstein with Dech after Cod. 1294; vide the rule by which the verse is divided, Torath Emeth, p. 51, 12.)<p>As Schultens has already rightly determined the fundamental meaning of &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;, frequently compared with the Sanskr. vid, to know (whence by gunating,<p>(Note: Guna  equals  a rule in Sanskrit grammar regulating the modification of vowels.)<p>vda, knowledge), after the Arab. wad'a, as deponere, penes se condere, so he also rightly explains &#1495;&#1499;&#1502;&#1492; by soliditas; it means properly (from &#1495;&#1499;&#1501;, Arab. hakm, R. hk, vide under <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/10-8.htm">Psalm 10:8</a>, to be firm, closed) compactness, and then, like &#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;, ability, worldly wisdom, prudence, and in the higher general sense, the knowledge of things in the essence of their being and in the reality of their existence.
