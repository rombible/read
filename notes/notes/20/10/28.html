That wealth which is truly desirable, has no vexation of spirit in the enjoyment; no grief for the loss; no guilt by the abuse of it. What comes from the love of God, has the grace of God for its companion. 23. Only foolish and wicked men divert themselves with doing harm to others, or tempting to sin. 24. The largest desire of eternal blessings the righteous can form, will be granted. 25. The course of prosperous sinners is like a whirlwind, which soon spends itself, and is gone. 26. As vinegar sets the teeth on edge, and as the smoke causes the eyes to smart, so the sluggard vexes his employer. 27,28. What man is he that loves life?

Here is the first half of the ora et labora. The proverb is a compendium of <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/127-1.htm">Psalm 127:1-2</a>. 22b is to be understood, according to <a href="/psalms/127-2.htm">Psalm 127:2</a> of this Solomonic psalm, not that God adds to His blessing no sorrow, much rather with the possession grants at the same time a joyful, peaceful mind (lxx, Targ., Syriac, Jerome, Aben-Ezra, Michaelis, and others), which would require the word &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;; but that trouble, labour, i.e., strenuous self-endeavours, add not (anything) to it, i.e., that it does not associate itself with the blessing (which, as the Jewish interpreters rightly remark, is, according to its nature, &#1514;&#1493;&#1505;&#1508;&#1514;, as the curse is &#1495;&#1505;&#1512;&#1493;&#1503;) as the causa efficiens, or if we supply quidquam, as the complement to &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468; along with it: nothing is added thereto, which goes along with that which the blessing of God grants, and completes it.

Older editions, as Venice 1525, 1615, Basel 1618, have &#1493;&#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1497;&#1493;&#1505;&#1507; &#1506;&#1510;&#1489; &#1506;&#1502;&#1492;, the transformation of &#1493;&#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1497;&#1493;&#1505;&#1507; &#1506;&#1510;&#1489;.
