They may be removed from place to place in this world, through the persecutions of their enemies, or through one providence or another, as they often are; they may be removed from a state of outward prosperity to a state of adversity, as Job was; they may be removed from spiritual and comfortable frames of soul to carnal or uncomfortable ones; for good frames are very precarious and uncertain things; and they will be removed out of this world into another; here they have no continuing city: but they shall never be removed from the love of God, nothing can separate them from that; they are set as a seal on his heart, and are engraven on the palms of his hands, and there is no removing them from thence; they may be waiver about their interest in the love of God; they may be without the manifestations and discoveries of it to their souls; they may be under the hidings of God's face; they may be at a distance from his house and ordinances, or may not enjoy the presence of God in them for a time; yet not separated from his affections; they shall never be removed out of the hands of Christ, into which they are put for security, and out of which none can pluck them, men or devils; how should they, since they are in those hands that made the heavens and the earth, support all in being, and hold the reins of government? Was it possible they could be removed from hence, it would impeach the wisdom of God, who has put them there; argue weakness in Christ, and suppose danger to them. Nor can they be removed out of the family of God; sons of God abide in his house for ever; they are no more foreigners and strangers; once children, no more servants; they may be corrected and chastised, yet be children; they may judge themselves unworthy of the relation, and be ready to conclude that their spots are not the spots of God's children, and fear they are none of them, and yet the relation continues: nor will they ever be removed from their state of justification, by which they are denominated righteous, into a state of condemnation; for full satisfaction is given to law and justice for them; their justification is complete, it is from all sin; the righteousness by which they are justified is everlasting, and even their faith which receives it shall never fail; to which may be added, that they are secured from wrath to come, and entitled to eternal life. In a word, they are on the sure foundation of electing grace; they are in the immovable covenant of grace; they are on the Rock of ages, Christ Jesus; all the divine Persons and perfections are on their side; they are kept by the power of God, through faith, unto salvation; see <a href="/psalms/55-22.htm">Psalm 55:22</a>; <p>but the wicked shall not inhabit the earth; but a very little while, as Gersom observes; and the time of their abode on earth is so short, as scarce to be called an inhabitation of it.

In 24b Ewald renders &#1497;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503; as adj. from &#1497;&#1514;&#1503; (whence &#1488;&#1497;&#1514;&#1503; ecne), after the form &#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1495;, and translates: yet to the righteous desire is always green. But whether &#1497;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503; is probably formed from &#1497;&#1514;&#1503;, and not from &#1504;&#1514;&#1503;, is a question in <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/12-12.htm">Proverbs 12:12</a>, but not here, where wishing and giving (fulfilling) are naturally correlata. Hitzig corrects &#1497;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503;, and certainly the supplying of '&#1492; is as little appropriate here as at <a href="/proverbs/13-21.htm">Proverbs 13:21</a>. Also a "one gives" is scarcely intended (according to which the Targ., Syr., and Jerome translate passively), in which case the Jewish interpreters are wont to explain &#1497;&#1514;&#1503;, scil. &#1492;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;&#1503;; for if the poet thought of &#1497;&#1514;&#1503; fo with a personal subject, why did he not rescue it from the dimness of such vague generality? Thus, then, &#1497;&#1514;&#1503; is, with Bttcher, to be interpreted as impersonal, like <a href="/proverbs/13-10.htm">Proverbs 13:10</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/37-10.htm">Job 37:10</a>, and perhaps also <a href="/genesis/38-28.htm">Genesis 38:28</a> (Ewald, 295a): what the righteous wish, that there is, i.e., it becomes actual, is fulfilled. In this we have not directly and exclusively to think of the destiny at which the godless are afraid (<a href="/hebrews/10-27.htm">Hebrews 10:27</a>), and toward which the desire of the righteous goes forth; but the clause has also truth which is realized in this world: just that which they greatly fear, e.g., sickness, bankruptcy, the loss of reputation, comes upon the godless; on the contrary that which the righteous wish realizes itself, because their wish, in its intention, and kind, and content, stands in harmony with the order of the moral world. </body></html>
