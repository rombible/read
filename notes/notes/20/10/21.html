Both the just and the wicked must die; but between their souls there is a vast difference. 8. The wise in heart puts his knowledge in practice. 9. Dissemblers, after all their shuffling, will be exposed. 10. Trick and artifice will be no excuse for iniquity. 11. The good man's mouth is always open to teach, comfort, and correct others. 12. Where there is hatred, every thing stirs up strife. By bearing with each other, peace and harmony are preserved. 13. Those that foolishly go on in wicked ways, prepare rods for themselves. 14. Whatever knowledge may be useful, we must lay it up, that it may not be to seek when we want it. The wise gain this wisdom by reading, by hearing the word, by meditation, by prayer, by faith in Christ, who is made of God unto us wisdom. 15. This refers to the common mistakes both of rich and poor, as to their outward condition. Rich people's wealth exposes them to many dangers; while a poor man may live comfortably, if he is content, keeps a good conscience, and lives by faith. 16. Perhaps a righteous man has no more than what he works hard for, but that labour tends to life. 17. The traveller that has missed his way, and cannot bear to be told of it, and to be shown the right way, must err still. 18. He is especially a fool who thinks to hide anything from God; and malice is no better. 19. Those that speak much, speak much amiss. He that checks himself is a wise man, and therein consults his own peace. 20,21. The tongue of the just is sincere, freed from the dross of guile and evil design. Pious discourse is spiritual food to the needy. Fools die for want of a heart, so the word is; for want of thought.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Feed - The Hebrew word, like &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;  poimainein, includes the idea of guiding as well as nourishing; doing a shepherd's work in both.<p>For want of wisdom - Some prefer, through him who wanteth understanding, referring to a person.

Not their bodies; words are but wind, and will not feed; it is not enough to say to the distressed, "be ye warmed and filled", and give nothing; unless this can be understood of obtaining food for others by their prayers, as Jarchi interprets it: but the souls of many; these the righteous feed, by communicating the spiritual knowledge and understanding of divine things they are partakers of; by setting before them the bread of life, the honey and milk of the Gospel, they have under their tongue; and by the good counsel and advice, comforts and admonitions, they give them; see <a href="/jeremiah/3-15.htm">Jeremiah 3:15</a>; <p>but fools die for want of wisdom: not a corporeal death, which is common to men of every rank and quality; wise men die even as fools; but they continue under the power of a spiritual death, for want of enlightening and quickening grace, and so die an eternal death: not for want of natural wisdom, which they may have a greater share of than those who live spiritually and eternally; but for want of spiritual wisdom and knowledge; the knowledge of Christ, and the way of life and salvation by him, and the knowledge of God in Christ; and not always for the want of the means of such wisdom and knowledge; as the Scriptures, which are able to make a man wise unto salvation; and the Gospel, which is the wisdom of God in a mystery; but through the neglect and contempt of them: though sometimes men perish through want of the means of knowledge, and the neglect of those who should instruct them, <a href="/hosea/4-6.htm">Hosea 4:6</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/10.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The lips of the righteous <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> feed many: but fools die for lack of wisdom.</span><p>(i) For they speak truth and edify many by exhortations, admonition and counsel.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/10.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">21</span>. <span class="ital">feed</span>] In the wider sense perhaps which the word commonly has, <span class="ital">supply the wants of, as a shepherd does</span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Feed many.</span> The righteous by wise counsel teach, support, and guide others (<a href="/ecclesiastes/12-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:11</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/3-15.htm">Jeremiah 3:15</a>). So the clergy are the shepherds of their flocks  (<a href="/john/21-15.htm">John 21:15</a>; <a href="/acts/20-28.htm">Acts 20:28</a>; <a href="/1_peter/5-2.htm">1 Peter 5:2</a>). The LXX. has a different reading, "know high things." <span class="cmt_word">Fools die for want of wisdom.</span> Far from "feeding" others, they bring ruin on themselves (<a href="/proverbs/5-23.htm">Proverbs 5:23</a>). Others translate, "die through one who wanteth understanding;" but if the Hebrew will bear this rendering, it is obvious that fools need no guide to their fall; their fate is a natural result. In this case the meaning must be that the foolish man involves others in destruction. But it is best to translate as the Authorized Version. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>A pair of proverbs regarding possession and gain.<p>Regarding possession:<p>The rich man's wealth is his strong city;<p>The destruction of the poor is their poverty.<p>The first line  equals  <a href="/proverbs/18-11.htm">Proverbs 18:11</a>. One may render the idea according to that which is internal, and according to that which is external; and the proverb remains in both cases true. As &#1506;&#1494; may mean, of itself alone, power, as means of protection, or a bulwark (<a href="/psalms/8-3.htm">Psalm 8:3</a>), or the consciousness of power, high feeling, pride (<a href="/judges/5-21.htm">Judges 5:21</a>); so &#1511;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; &#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1493; may be rendered as an object of self-confidence, and &#1502;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;, on the contrary, as an object of terror (<a href="/jeremiah/48-39.htm">Jeremiah 48:39</a>): the rich man, to whom his estate (vid., on &#1492;&#1493;&#1503;, p. 63) affords a sure reserve and an abundant source of help, can appear confident and go forth energetically; on the contrary, the poor man is timid and bashful, and is easily dejected and discouraged. Thus e.g., Oetinger and Hitzig. But the objective interpretation is allowable, and lies also much nearer: the rich man stands thus independent, changes and adversities cannot so easily overthrow him, he is also raised above many hazards and temptations; on the contrary, the poor man is overthrown by little misfortunes, and his despairing endeavours to save himself, when they fail, ruin him completely, and perhaps make him at the same time a moral outlaw. It is quite an experienced fact which this proverb expresses, but one from which the double doctrine is easily derived: (1) That it is not only advised, but also commanded, that man make the firm establishing of his external life-position the aim of his endeavour; (2) That one ought to treat with forbearance the humble man; and if he always sinks deeper and deeper, one ought not to judge him with unmerciful harshness and in proud self-exaltation. </body></html>
