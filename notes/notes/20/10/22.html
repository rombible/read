In the diligent use of means; see <a href="/proverbs/10-4.htm">Proverbs 10:4</a>; riches are from the Lord, and should be acknowledged as such, and not attributed to the industry, diligence, sagacity, and merit of men; but should be looked upon as had through the blessing of the Lord upon the labours of men; and when they come this way they come as a blessing, and with one: it may be understood of being made rich in a spiritual sense; it is the blessing, good will, and favour of God, that makes men rich in Christ; that bestows upon them his unsearchable riches; that enriches them with all spiritual blessings in him; that makes them rich in faith and in good works, and with the riches of grace and of glory; <p>and he addeth no sorrow with it; no sorrow goes along with the blessing, but what is a blessing itself, as one observes; riches enjoyed through the blessing of God are not attended with that sorrow in getting, keeping, and losing them, as the riches of wicked men unlawfully gotten are; see <a href="/1_timothy/6-9.htm">1 Timothy 6:9</a>; for as the good man comes by them easily, without any anxious care and sinful solicitude, he seeking the kingdom of God and his righteousness, all these things are added to him, over and above, without much thought about them, or expectation of them, <a href="/matthew/6-33.htm">Matthew 6:33</a>; so it is with great delight, pleasure, and cheerfulness, he enjoys them, and readily communicates them to others; while the wicked man is full of anxiety, distress, and sorrow; see <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:12</a>. This is eminently true of spiritual riches; there is no sorrow attending them; the fruit and effect of them are peace, joy, and comfort. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/10.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The blessing of the LORD, it maketh rich, and he addeth <span class="cverse3">{k}</span> no sorrow with it.</span><p>(k) Meaning that all worldly things bring care and sorrow, where as they who feel the blessings of God have none.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/10.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">22</span>. <span class="ital">addeth no sorrow</span>] It is without alloy, free from the drawbacks and anxieties which attach to earthly riches.

The Septuagint adds, "upon the head of the righteous," as in Ver. 6. Not chance and luck, not even industry and labour, but God giveth the increase (<a href="/ecclesiastes/5-18.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:18, 19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He addeth no sorrow with it;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> with the Blessing. In acquiring and in using wealth thus blessed, the good man is contented and happy, while unsanctified fiches bring only trouble and vexation. But this seems rather feeble, and it is better to render, "And a man's own labor addeth nothing thereto." A man's own work must not be regarded as an equal cause of prosperity with the favour of God. This sentiment is in accordance with <a href="/psalms/127-1.htm">Psalm 127:1, 2</a>, "Except the Lord build the house, their labour is but lost that build it so he giveth unto his beloved in sleep" - what others vainly labour for God giveth to the righteous without toil. The rendering of the clause, "Trouble is of no avail without it," is scarcely warranted by the wording of the text. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Regarding gain:<p>The gain of the righteous tendeth to life;<p>The income of the godless to sin.<p>Intentionally, that which the righteous received is called &#1508;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; (as <a href="/leviticus/19-13.htm">Leviticus 19:13</a>), as a reward of his labour; that which the godless receives is called &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1492;, as income which does not need to be the reward of labour, and especially of his own immediate labour.

The reward of his labour serves to the righteous to establish his life, i.e., to make sure his life-position, and to elevate his life-happiness. On the contrary, the income of the godless serves only to ruin his life; for, made thereby full and confident, he adds sin to sin, whose wages is death. Hitzig translates: for expiation, i.e., to lose it again as atonement for past sins; but if &#1495;&#1497;&#1497;&#1501; and &#1495;&#1496;&#1488;&#1514; are contrasted with each other, then &#1495;&#1496;&#1488;&#1514; is death-bringing sin (<a href="/proverbs/8-35.htm">Proverbs 8:35</a>.). </body></html>
