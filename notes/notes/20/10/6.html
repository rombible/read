Blessings&#8212;literally, "Praises." The last clause is better: "The mouth of the wicked covereth (or concealeth) violence (or mischievous devices)" to be executed in due time (Ps 5:9; 10:7; Ro 3:14), and hence has no praises (compare Pr 10:11).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/proverbs/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Blessings are upon the head of the just; </span> all sorts of blessings are wished to them by men, and conferred upon them by God.

Violence, or the violent, and injurious, and mischievous practices of others against them, deserved by their own violence committed against others, and inflicted upon them by the curse and righteous judgment of God) shall cover the mouth of the wicked, i.e. shall fall upon them. This phrase of covering their mouth is used, either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. With allusion to the ancient custom of covering the mouths and faces of condemned malefactors; of which see <span class="bld"><a href="/esther/7-8.htm" title="Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine; and Haman was fallen on the bed where on Esther was. Then said the king, Will he force the queen also before me in the house? As the word went out of king's mouth, they covered Haman's face.">Esther 7:8</a> <a href="/job/9-24.htm" title="The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covers the faces of the judges thereof; if not, where, and who is he?">Job 9:24</a></span>. Or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. To signify that the curse and judgment of God upon them should be so manifestly just, that their mouths should be stopped, and they not be able to speak a word against God, or for themselves. Or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. To intimate that God’s judgment upon them should be public and evident to all that behold them, as any covering put upon a man’s mouth or face is, as for the same reason the blessings of the just were said to be upon their heads. And <span class="ital">the mouth</span> may be put for the <span class="ital">face</span> or <span class="ital">countenance</span>, by a synecdoche. But this clause is otherwise rendered by divers learned interpreters, <span class="ital">the mouth of the wicked covereth</span> (i.e. concealeth or smothereth within itself, and doth not utter that) <span class="ital">violence</span> or <span class="ital">injury</span>, which he meditateth in his heart, and designeth to do to others, and therefore shall be accursed and miserable. But this suits not so well with the former clause, wherein <span class="ital">the blessings of the just</span> are not meant actively, of those blessings which they wish or give to others, but passively, of those blessings which others wish or give to them; and consequently this violence is not understood of that which they do to others, but of that which is done to them by others. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/proverbs/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Blessings are upon the head of the just,.... That seeks for righteousness, not by the works of the law, but by faith; that lives by faith upon the righteousness of Christ, and is justified by it, made, accounted, and reckoned just through it; and, in consequence of his faith, does justly, and lives soberly, righteously, and godly: upon his "head", who is Christ, blessings are; for he is "the head of every such man", <a href="/1_corinthians/11-3.htm">1 Corinthians 11:3</a>; not the pope of Rome, but Christ, is head of the church; he is the representative and federal head of all the elect, both in eternity and time; he is a political head to them, as a king is to his subjects; an economical one, as the husband is the head of the wife, a father the head of his family, and a master the head of his servants; and he is in such sense a head to them as a natural head is to its body; he is of the same nature with them, superior to them, a perfect, only, everliving, and everlasting head. Upon him all the blessings of grace and goodness are; his people are blessed with them in him, their head, <a href="/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3</a>; and from him they descend to them, the members of his body, just as the oil on Aaron's head ran down his beard to the skirts of his garments. So in an ancient writing of the Jews (y), this passage being mentioned, it is asked, Who is the head of the righteous? The answer is, the middle pillar; by whom they seem to mean a middle person, the Mediator, the Messiah. Or else, a part being put for the whole, the meaning is, that blessings are upon the persons of righteous ones, as the word is used in <a href="/proverbs/11-26.htm">Proverbs 11:26</a>; the Targum renders it, <p>"the heads of the righteous.'' <p>All covenant blessings, spiritual ones, such as are blessings indeed, solid and substantial, irreversible, and for ever; particularly a justifying righteousness, from whence they are denominated just; pardon of sin, peace of soul, every sanctifying grace, the blessing of adoption, and a right to eternal life: these being said to be on the "head" of them, may denote that they come from above, and descend in a way of grace upon them; that they are visible and manifest; that they reside, continue, and remain upon them; that they are as an ornament and crown unto them; and that they are a security of them that no wrath and vengeance can fall upon them. The Septuagint, Vulgate Latin, and Arabic versions, read, "the blessing of the Lord is upon the head of the just"; and such are all the blessings before mentioned; <p>but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked; that is, either his violent dealings are open and manifest, and are a scandal to him, as well as entail a curse on him; or rather the fruit and effect of his violence and oppression, the punishment due thereunto, is so righteously inflicted on him, that his mouth is stopped, and he has not one word to say against the just judgments of God upon him, for his violent usage of men, whether here or hereafter; see <a href="/psalms/107-42.htm">Psalm 107:42</a>. Some render the words, "the mouth of the wicked covereth violence" (z); palliates and excuses it, and calls it by another name; or hides and conceals that which is in the heart, and does not utter it; see <a href="/proverbs/10-18.htm">Proverbs 10:18</a>. The Targum is, <p>"in the mouth of the wicked rapine is covered;'' <p>as a sweet morsel under their tongue, though in the end bitterness. <p>(y) Tikkune Zohar.

To this, however, it is objected that the Heb. word always connotes <span class="ital">wrongful</span> treatment.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The idea of covering the mouth as a sign of condemnation is farfetched, and it is not borne out by the passages cited in support of it (<a href="/esther/7-8.htm" title="Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine; and Haman was fallen on the bed where on Esther was.

This is usually explained to mean either that the consciousness of his own iniquity silences the sinner when he would speak against the righteous, or his violence and injustice, returning on his own head, are like a bandage over his mouth (<a href="/leviticus/13-45.htm">Leviticus 13:45</a>; <a href="/micah/3-7.htm">Micah 3:7</a>), reducing him to shame and silence. Others, again, consider the signification to be - in default of the good, honest words which should proceed from a man's mouth, the sinner pours forth injustice and wickedness. But it is best (as in Ver. 14) to take "mouth" as the subject: "The mouth of the wicked concealeth violence," that he may wait for the opportunity of practising it. The contrast is between the manifest blessedness of the righteous and the secret sinister proceedings of the evil. The Vulgate and Septuagint give, "the blessing of the Lord." For "violence" the Septuagint has <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "untimely grief;" the Hebrew word <span class="accented">chamas</span> bearing also the sense of "misery." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>He goes within:<p>18 And he knows not that the dead are there;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the depths of Hades, her guests.<p>How near to one another the house of the adulteress and Hades are, so that a man passes through the one into the other, is already stated in <a href="/proverbs/2-18.htm">Proverbs 2:18</a>; <a href="/proverbs/7-27.htm">Proverbs 7:27</a>.
