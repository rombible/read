This abstract &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;, derived from &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;, must be vocalized as &#1488;&#1499;&#1494;&#1512;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;; Hitzig thinks it is written with a on account of the following u sound, but this formation always ends in ijju&#770;th, not ajju&#770;th. But as from &#1495;&#1494;&#1492; as well &#1495;&#1494;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503;  equals  &#1495;&#1494;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503; as &#1495;&#1494;&#1493;&#1503; is formed, so from &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1492; as well &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; like &#1495;&#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; or &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; like &#1500;&#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;, &#1512;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;, as &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; (instead of which &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; is preferred) can be formed; Kimchi rightly (Michlol 181a) presents the word under the form &#1508;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;. With &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500; (<a href="/proverbs/14-7.htm">Proverbs 14:7</a>) poetic, and stronger than &#1500;&#1488;&#1493;, the designation of the subject is continued; the words &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500;&#1470;&#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1492; &#1502;&#1468;&#1492; (thus with Mercha and without Makkeph following, &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1492; is to be written, after Codd. and old editions) have the value of an adjective: and not knowing anything at all (&#1502;&#1492;  equals  &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#768;, as <a href="/numbers/23-3.htm">Numbers 23:3</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/13-13.htm">Job 13:13</a>, and here in the negative clause, as in prose &#1502;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492;), i.e., devoid of all knowledge. The Targ. translates explanatorily: not recognising &#1496;&#1489;&#1514;&#1468;&#1488;, the good; and the lxx substitutes: she knows not shame, which, according to Hitzig, supposes the word &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;, approved of by him; but &#1499;&#1500;&#1502;&#1492; means always pudefactio, not pudor. To know no &#1499;&#1500;&#1502;&#1492; would be equivalent to, to let no shaming from without influence one; for shamelessness the poet would have made use of the expression &#1493;&#1489;&#1500;&#1470;&#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;. In &#1493;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1492; the declaration regarding the subject beginning with &#1492;&#1493;&#1502;&#1497;&#1492; is continued: Folly also has a house in which works of folly are carried one, and has set herself down by the door (&#1500;&#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1495; as &#1500;&#1508;&#1497;, <a href="/proverbs/8-3.htm">Proverbs 8:3</a>) of this house; she sits there &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1468;&#1488;. Most interpreters here think on a throne (lxx &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;, used especially of the sella curulis); and Zckler, as Umbreit, Hitzig, and others, connecting genitiv. therewith &#1502;&#1512;&#1502;&#1497; &#1511;&#1512;&#1514;, changes in 14b the scene, for he removes the "high throne of the city" from the door of the house to some place elsewhere. But the sitting is in contrast to the standing and going on the part of Wisdom on the streets preaching (Evagrius well renders: in molli ignavaque sella); and if &#1499;&#1505;&#1488; and house-door are named along with each other, the former is a seat before the latter, and the accentuation rightly separates by Mugrash &#1499;&#1505;&#1488; from &#1502;&#1512;&#1502;&#1497; &#1511;&#1512;&#1514;. "According to the accents and the meaning, &#1502;&#1512;&#1502;&#1497; &#1511;&#1512;&#1514; is the acc. loci: on the high places of the city, as <a href="/proverbs/8-2.htm">Proverbs 8:2</a>."

She sits before her door to call &#1500;&#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497; &#1491;&#1512;&#1498; (with Munach, as in Cod. 1294 and old editions, without the Makkeph), those who go along the way (genitive connection with the supposition of the accusative construction, transire viam, as <a href="/proverbs/2-7.htm">Proverbs 2:7</a>), to call (invite) &#1492;&#1502;&#1497;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; (to be pointed with &#1502; raphatum and Gaja going before, according to Ben-Asher's rule; vid., Methegsetz. 20), those who make straight their path, i.e., who go straight on, directly before them (cf. <a href="/isaiah/57-2.htm">Isaiah 57:2</a>). The participial construction (the schemes amans Dei and amans Deum), as well as that of the verb &#1511;&#1512;&#1488; (first with the dat. and then with the accus.), interchange. </body></html>
