Although I cannot affirm, says Bishop Patrick, “that there is an order observed in all these proverbs, yet this first sentence seems not to have been casually, but designedly, set in the front of the rest; because nothing contributes so much, every way, to the happiness of mankind, as a religious care about the education of children, which parents are here admonished to attend to if they desire their children should not prove a grief and shame to them: and children are put in mind of the obedience they owe to their instructions, that they may be a joy to them.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:1 The comfort of parents much depends on their children; and this suggests to both, motives to their duties. 2,3.

Here begins the second part of the book, Pr 10:1-22:16, which, with the third, Pr 22:16-25:28, contains series of proverbs whose sense is complete in one or two verses, and which, having no logical connection, admit of no analysis. The parallelisms of Pr 10:1-15:33 are mostly antithetic; and those of Pr 16:1-22:16, synthetic. The evidences of art in the structure are very clear, and indicate, probably, a purpose of facilitating the labor of memorizing.<p>1. wise [and] foolish&#8212;as they follow or reject the precepts of wisdom.<p>maketh &#8230; father&#8212;or, "gladdens a father."<p>heaviness&#8212;or, "grief."From this chapter to the five and twentieth, are sundry observations of moral virtues, and their contrary vices, with excellent rules for the government of our conversation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="bld">The proverbs of Solomon, </span> properly so called; for the foregoing chapters, though they had this title in the beginning of them, yet in truth were only a preface or preparation to them, containing a general exhortation to the study and exercise of wisdom, to stir up the minds of men to the greater attention and regard to all its precepts, whereof some here follow; of which in general these things are fit to be observed, to help us in the understanding of them: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. That these sentences are generally distinct and independent, having no coherence one with another, as many other parts of Scripture have. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. That such sentences being very short, as their nature requires, more is understood in them than is expressed, and the causes are commonly to be gathered from the effects, and the effects from the causes, and one opposite from another, as we shall see. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. That they are delivered by way of comparison and opposition, which for the most part is between virtue and vice, but sometimes is between two virtues, or two vices. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">A wise son, </span> i.e. prudent, and especially virtuous and godly, as this word is commonly meant in this book, and in many other scriptures. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">A glad father; </span> and a glad mother too; for both parents are to be understood in both branches, as is evident from the nature of the thing, which affects both of them, and from parallel places, as <span class="bld"><a href="/proverbs/17-25.htm" title="A foolish son is a grief to his father, and bitterness to her that bore him.">Proverbs 17:25</a> 30:17</span>, although one only be expressed in each branch, for the greater elegancy. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The heaviness of his mother; </span> the occasion of her great sorrow, which is decently ascribed to the mothers rather than to the fathers, because their passions are most vehement, and make deepest impression in them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/proverbs/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>The proverbs of Solomon,.... This title is repeated from <a href="/proverbs/1-1.htm">Proverbs 1:1</a>; and very properly stands here; since here begin those pithy sentences of Solomon, which bear the name of proverbs; the preceding chapters being a sort of preface or introduction to them; in which Solomon recommends the study of wisdom, shows the profit and advantage of it, gives directions about it, and prepares for the reception of those wise sayings that follow; which are for the most part independent of each other, and consist generally of clauses set in a contrast to one another, and often expressed by similes and metaphors; <p>a wise son maketh a glad father; as Solomon made glad his father David: for no doubt there were appearances of his wisdom before he came to the throne, though greater afterwards; which made David rejoice that he was placed on the throne before his death, to whom he had committed the charge of building the house of the Lord; <p>but a foolish son is the heaviness of his mother; brings grief and trouble to her, as perhaps Rehoboam did to his mother: though all this is to be understood conjunctly of both parents, and not separately of each; not as if a wise son only was matter of joy to his father, who may be thought to be a better judge of his wisdom, and more abroad to hear the fame of it, and to observe the effects of it; or as if a foolish son only caused grief to his mother, because more at home, and more privy to his foolish behaviour; but as being equally joyous or afflicting to both parents. Nor is this to be understood of such who are wise and foolish as to their natural capacities only; but who are so in a moral sense, either virtuous or vicious, good or wicked. Wherefore parents should be concerned for the education of their children, whose behaviour much depends upon it; and children for their conduct towards their parents and in the world, since their joy and grief are influenced by it. Some interpret the words mystically, the "father", of God; the "mother", of the church; and, the "sons", of the children of them both: and so may fitly describe the different followers of Christ and antichrist; the one being wise, the other foolish; the one acceptable to God, the other not. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/10.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The proverbs of Solomon.

The sections are noted by their commencing usually with the words, "a wise son." <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The proverbs of Solomon.</span> This is the title of the new part of the book; it is omitted in the Septuagint. There is some kind of loose connection in the grouping of these proverbs, but it is difficult to follow. "Ordo frustra quaeritur ubi nullus fuit observatus," says Mart. Geier. Wordsworth considers the present chapter to contain exemplifications of the principles and results of the two ways of life displayed in the preceding nine chapters. The antithetical character of the sentences is most marked and well sustained. As the book is specially designed for the edification of youth, it begins with an appropriate saying. <span class="cmt_word">A wise son maketh a glad father.</span> As wisdom comprises all moral excellence, and folly is vice and perversity, the opposite characters attributed to the son are obvious. The mother is introduced for the sake of parallelism; though some commentators suggest that as the father would be naturally elated by his son's virtues, which would conduce to honour and high estate, so the mother would be grieved at vices which her training had not subdued, and her indulgence had fostered. If this seems somewhat far-fetched, we may consider that the father in the maxim includes the mother, and the mother the father, the two being separated for the purpose of contrast (see on Proverbs 26:3). The word for heaviness occurs in <a href="/proverbs/14-13.htm">Proverbs 14:13</a> and Proverbs 17:21. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The poet now brings before us another figure, for he personifies Folly working in opposition to Wisdom, and gives her a feminine name, as the contrast to Wisdom required, and thereby to indicate that the seduction, as the 13th proverbial discourse (chap. 7) has shown, appears especially in the form of degraded womanhood:<p>13 The woman Folly [Frau Thorheit] conducts herself boisterously,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wantonness, and not knowing anything at all;<p>14 And hath seated herself at the door of her house,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On a seat high up in the city,<p>15 To call to those who walk in the way,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who go straight on their path.<p>The connection of &#1488;&#1513;&#1514; &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; is genitival, and the genitive is not, as in &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514; &#1512;&#1506;, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/6-24.htm">Proverbs 6:24</a>, specifying, but appositional, as in &#1489;&#1514;&#1470;&#1510;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503; (vid., under <a href="/isaiah/1-8.htm">Isaiah 1:8</a>). &#1492;&#1493;&#1502;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; [boisterous] is pred., as <a href="/proverbs/7-11.htm">Proverbs 7:11</a> : her object is sensual, and therefore her appearance excites passionately, overcoming the resistance of the mind by boisterousness. In 13b it is further said who and how she is. &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; she is called as wantonness personified. This abstract &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;, derived from &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;, must be vocalized as &#1488;&#1499;&#1494;&#1512;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;; Hitzig thinks it is written with a on account of the following u sound, but this formation always ends in ijju&#770;th, not ajju&#770;th. But as from &#1495;&#1494;&#1492; as well &#1495;&#1494;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503;  equals  &#1495;&#1494;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503; as &#1495;&#1494;&#1493;&#1503; is formed, so from &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1492; as well &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; like &#1495;&#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; or &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; like &#1500;&#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;, &#1512;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;, as &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; (instead of which &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; is preferred) can be formed; Kimchi rightly (Michlol 181a) presents the word under the form &#1508;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;. With &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500; (<a href="/proverbs/14-7.htm">Proverbs 14:7</a>) poetic, and stronger than &#1500;&#1488;&#1493;, the designation of the subject is continued; the words &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500;&#1470;&#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1492; &#1502;&#1468;&#1492; (thus with Mercha and without Makkeph following, &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1492; is to be written, after Codd. and old editions) have the value of an adjective: and not knowing anything at all (&#1502;&#1492;  equals  &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#768;, as <a href="/numbers/23-3.htm">Numbers 23:3</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/13-13.htm">Job 13:13</a>, and here in the negative clause, as in prose &#1502;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492;), i.e., devoid of all knowledge. The Targ. translates explanatorily: not recognising &#1496;&#1489;&#1514;&#1468;&#1488;, the good; and the lxx substitutes: she knows not shame, which, according to Hitzig, supposes the word &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;, approved of by him; but &#1499;&#1500;&#1502;&#1492; means always pudefactio, not pudor. To know no &#1499;&#1500;&#1502;&#1492; would be equivalent to, to let no shaming from without influence one; for shamelessness the poet would have made use of the expression &#1493;&#1489;&#1500;&#1470;&#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;. In &#1493;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1492; the declaration regarding the subject beginning with &#1492;&#1493;&#1502;&#1497;&#1492; is continued: Folly also has a house in which works of folly are carried one, and has set herself down by the door (&#1500;&#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1495; as &#1500;&#1508;&#1497;, <a href="/proverbs/8-3.htm">Proverbs 8:3</a>) of this house; she sits there &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1468;&#1488;. Most interpreters here think on a throne (lxx &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;, used especially of the sella curulis); and Zckler, as Umbreit, Hitzig, and others, connecting genitiv. therewith &#1502;&#1512;&#1502;&#1497; &#1511;&#1512;&#1514;, changes in 14b the scene, for he removes the "high throne of the city" from the door of the house to some place elsewhere. But the sitting is in contrast to the standing and going on the part of Wisdom on the streets preaching (Evagrius well renders: in molli ignavaque sella); and if &#1499;&#1505;&#1488; and house-door are named along with each other, the former is a seat before the latter, and the accentuation rightly separates by Mugrash &#1499;&#1505;&#1488; from &#1502;&#1512;&#1502;&#1497; &#1511;&#1512;&#1514;. "According to the accents and the meaning, &#1502;&#1512;&#1502;&#1497; &#1511;&#1512;&#1514; is the acc. loci: on the high places of the city, as <a href="/proverbs/8-2.htm">Proverbs 8:2</a>." (Fl.). They are the high points of the city, to which, as Wisdom, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/9-3.htm">Proverbs 9:3</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/8-2.htm">Proverbs 8:2</a>, so also Folly, her rival (wherefore <a href="/ecclesiastes/10-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:6</a> does not appertain to this place), invites followers to herself. She sits before her door to call &#1500;&#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497; &#1491;&#1512;&#1498; (with Munach, as in Cod. 1294 and old editions, without the Makkeph), those who go along the way (genitive connection with the supposition of the accusative construction, transire viam, as <a href="/proverbs/2-7.htm">Proverbs 2:7</a>), to call (invite) &#1492;&#1502;&#1497;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; (to be pointed with &#1502; raphatum and Gaja going before, according to Ben-Asher's rule; vid., Methegsetz. 20), those who make straight their path, i.e., who go straight on, directly before them (cf. <a href="/isaiah/57-2.htm">Isaiah 57:2</a>). The participial construction (the schemes amans Dei and amans Deum), as well as that of the verb &#1511;&#1512;&#1488; (first with the dat. and then with the accus.), interchange. </body></html>
