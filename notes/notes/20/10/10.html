Both the just and the wicked must die; but between their souls there is a vast difference. 8. The wise in heart puts his knowledge in practice. 9. Dissemblers, after all their shuffling, will be exposed. 10. Trick and artifice will be no excuse for iniquity. 11. The good man's mouth is always open to teach, comfort, and correct others. 12. Where there is hatred, every thing stirs up strife. By bearing with each other, peace and harmony are preserved. 13. Those that foolishly go on in wicked ways, prepare rods for themselves. 14. Whatever knowledge may be useful, we must lay it up, that it may not be to seek when we want it. The wise gain this wisdom by reading, by hearing the word, by meditation, by prayer, by faith in Christ, who is made of God unto us wisdom. 15. This refers to the common mistakes both of rich and poor, as to their outward condition. Rich people's wealth exposes them to many dangers; while a poor man may live comfortably, if he is content, keeps a good conscience, and lives by faith. 16. Perhaps a righteous man has no more than what he works hard for, but that labour tends to life. 17. The traveller that has missed his way, and cannot bear to be told of it, and to be shown the right way, must err still. 18. He is especially a fool who thinks to hide anything from God; and malice is no better. 19. Those that speak much, speak much amiss. He that checks himself is a wise man, and therein consults his own peace. 20,21. The tongue of the just is sincere, freed from the dross of guile and evil design. Pious discourse is spiritual food to the needy. Fools die for want of a heart, so the word is; for want of thought.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In <a href="/proverbs/10-8.htm">Proverbs 10:8</a> the relation between the two clauses was one of contrast, here of resemblance.

The Syriac and Arabic versions add, "with fraud". A descriptive character of a wicked man, <a href="/proverbs/6-13.htm">Proverbs 6:13</a>; who so does, either to draw and allure persons to go along with him, and join him in his evil practices; or by way of scorn and contempt of others; or as a token to another of its being the proper time to circumvent his neighbour, or do him an injury.

In <span class="ital"><a href="/proverbs/10-8.htm" title="The wise in heart will receive commandments: but a prating fool shall fall.">Proverbs 10:8</a></span> the contrast is between a wise heart and an unbridled tongue, in its consequences to its possessor. Here it is between crafty reticence which injures others, and foolish loquacity which injures oneself.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“The Sept. and Syr. read, <span class="ital">But he that rebuketh openly maketh peace</span>,” R.V. marg.; but nothing is gained by the change.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that winketh with the</span> <span class="cmt_word">eye</span> (<a href="/proverbs/6-13.htm">Proverbs 6:13</a>). This is a sign of craft, malice, and complicity with other wicked comrades. Ecclus. 27:22, "He that winketh with the eyes worketh evil." <span class="cmt_word">Causeth sorrow</span> (<a href="/proverbs/15-13.htm">Proverbs 15:13</a>). He causes trouble and vexation by his cunning and secrecy. <span class="cmt_word">A prating fool</span> (as Ver. 8). The two clauses are intended to teach that the garrulous fool is even more certain to bring ruin on himself and others than the crafty plotter. The Septuagint and Syriac have changed the latter clause into a sentence supposed to be more forcibly antithetical, "He who reproveth with boldness maketh peace." But there are sentences not strictly antithetical in this chapter, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> vers. 18, 22 (comp. <a href="/proverbs/11-10.htm">Proverbs 11:10</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>There follow two proverbs which say how one man fails and another succeeds:<p>He becomes poor who bears a sluggish hand;<p>But the hand of the diligent maketh rich.<p>These three proverbs, <a href="/proverbs/19-15.htm">Proverbs 19:15</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/12-24.htm">Proverbs 12:24</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/12-27.htm">Proverbs 12:27</a>, are similar. From the last two it is seen that &#1512;&#1502;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; is a subst., as also from <a href="/psalms/120-2.htm">Psalm 120:2</a>. (&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503; &#1512;&#1502;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, from a crafty tongue) that it is an adject., and from <a href="/leviticus/14-15.htm">Leviticus 14:15</a>. (where &#1499;&#1468;&#1507; is fem.) that it may be at the same time an adject. here also. The masc. is &#1512;&#1502;&#1497;, like &#1496;&#1512;&#1497; to &#1496;&#1512;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; ot , but neither of these occur; "the fundamental idea is that of throwing oneself down lazily, when one with unbent muscles holds himself no longer erect and stretched, Arab. taramy" (Fl.). The translation: deceitful balances (Lwenstein after Rashi), is contrary to biblical usage, which knows nothing of &#1499;&#1507; in this Mishnic meaning. But if &#1499;&#1507; is here regarded as fem., then it cannot be the subject (Jerome, egestatem operata est manus remissa), since we read &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;, not &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;. But &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; also is not suitable as the subject (lxx, Syr., Targ.), for poverty is called &#1512;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, &#1512;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;; on the contrary, &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;, plur. &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; or &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;, is used adjectively. Since now the adject. &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-14.htm">1 Samuel 12:14</a>, is also written &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;, it may be translated: Poor is he who... (Bertheau); but we much rather expect the statement of that which happens to such an one, thus: Poor will he be... &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;, 3 praet.  equals  &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/34-11.htm">Psalm 34:11</a>, with the same (grammatically incorrect) full writing as &#1511;&#1488;&#1501;, <a href="/hosea/10-14.htm">Hosea 10:14</a>. In the conception of the subject, &#1499;&#1507;&#1470;&#1512;&#1502;&#1497;&#1492;, after <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-10.htm">Jeremiah 48:10</a>, is interpreted as the accus. of the manner (Berth.: whoever works with sluggish hand); but since &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1512;&#1502;&#1497;&#1492; (in another sense indeed: to practise cunning) is a common phrase, <a href="/psalms/52-4.htm">Psalm 52:4</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/101-7.htm">Psalm 101:7</a>, so also will &#1499;&#1507;&#1470;&#1512;&#1502;&#1497;&#1492; be regarded as the object: qui agit manum remissam, whoever carries or moves such a hand (Hitzig). In 4b working is placed opposite to bearing: the diligent hand makes rich, ditat or divitias parit; but not for itself (Gesen. and others: becomes rich), but for him who bears it. The diligent man is called &#1495;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509;, from &#1495;&#1512;&#1509;, to sharpen, for, as in &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c2;, acer, sharpness is transferred to energy; the form is the same as &#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511;, smooth (for the a&#772; is unchangeable, because recompensative), a kindred form to &#1511;&#1496;&#1493;&#1500; like &#1495;&#1502;&#1493;&#1509;, and Arab. fa&#770;'u&#770;l as fashawsh, a boaster, wind-bag, either of active (as &#1495;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;) or (as &#1495;&#1500;&#1493;&#1511;, &#1495;&#1512;&#1493;&#1509;, &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;, &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;) of passive signification. </body></html>
