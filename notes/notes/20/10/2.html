But a “righteous” man in Hebrew is one who “renders to all their due,” whether to God, as Noah, who was “just and perfect” before Him (<a href="/genesis/6-9.htm" title="These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.">Genesis 6:9</a>; <a href="/genesis/7-1.htm" title="And the LORD said to Noah, Come you and all your house into the ark; for you have I seen righteous before me in this generation.">Genesis 7:1</a>; comp. <a href="/ecclesiastes/7-20.htm" title="For there is not a just man on earth, that does good, and sins not.">Ecclesiastes 7:20</a>), or to man. To his fellow-men his “justice” will show itself in liberality (<a href="/psalms/37-21.htm" title="The wicked borrows, and pays not again: but the righteous shows mercy, and gives.">Psalm 37:21</a>), mercy (<a href="/proverbs/12-10.htm" title="A righteous man regards the life of his beast: but the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel.">Proverbs 12:10</a>), carefulness of speech (<a href="/proverbs/15-28.htm" title="The heart of the righteous studies to answer: but the mouth of the wicked pours out evil things.">Proverbs 15:28</a>), truthfulness (<a href="/proverbs/13-5.htm" title="A righteous man hates lying: but a wicked man is loathsome, and comes to shame.">Proverbs 13:5</a>), and wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/9-9.htm" title="Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser: teach a just man, and he will increase in learning.">Proverbs 9:9</a>). He is considerate to animals also (<a href="/proverbs/12-10.htm" title="A righteous man regards the life of his beast: but the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel.">Proverbs 12:10</a>). So in the sermon on the Mount our Lord (<a href="/matthew/6-1.htm" title="Take heed that you do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise you have no reward of your Father which is in heaven.">Matthew 6:1</a>) says, “Take heed that ye do not your ‘righteousness’ [so the best MSS. read] before men;” and then specifies it under the heads of almsgiving, prayer, and fasting. In this passage it forms a contrast to riches gained by wrong, and therefore would seem particularly to signify “almsgiving,” as its Greek equivalent does in <a href="/2_corinthians/9-10.htm" title="Now he that ministers seed to the sower both minister bread for your food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;)">2Corinthians 9:10</a>. It is often: rendered so by the LXX., and it is the most usual sense of the word in late Hebrew. It is so interpreted also in <a href="//apocrypha.org/tobit/4-10.htm" title="Because that alms do deliver from death, and suffereth not to come into darkness.">Tobit 4:10</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/tobit/12-9.htm" title="For alms doth deliver from death, and shall purge away all sin.

Nor can anyone by his riches either redeem himself or his brother from destruction, or give to God a ransom for him; nor can he by them save himself from a corporeal death one year, one month, one day, one hour, one moment; nor will they be of any service to him in the day of judgment, when wrath comes forth against him; <p>but righteousness delivereth from death; either that which is righteously got, though it be ever so little, is a means of preserving life, and keeps their souls from famishing, <a href="/proverbs/10-3.htm">Proverbs 10:3</a>; or else what is liberally dispensed, for alms are called "righteousness", <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/112-9.htm">Psalm 112:9</a>, <a href="/daniel/4-27.htm">Daniel 4:27</a>.

Moreover, righteousness may be considered as legal and evangelical; a legal righteousness, or the righteousness of men in obedience to the law, cannot deliver from the sentence of death the law has passed; it is not properly a righteousness; it is imperfect, cannot justify, save, or bring to heaven, or entitle to life; notwithstanding this a man must die: but there is an evangelical righteousness; and this is either imparted and implanted in men, is the new man, which is created in righteousness and holiness; and this delivers from a moral or spiritual death, a death in trespasses and sins men are in; for by it they are quickened, live a life of faith on Christ, and have communion with God; have his image stamped on them, and live to him, and to Christ, and to righteousness, being freed from the servitude and dominion of sin; living in which is no other than death: or this righteousness is imputed, which is the righteousness of Christ; wrought out for them, reckoned to them, received by them, and by which they are justified; this delivers them, though not from a corporeal death, yet from the sting and curse of it, and from it as a penal evil, or as a punishment for sin: and it delivers from a legal death, or from the sentence and condemnation of the law, and from the second and eternal death, and entities them to life everlasting. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/10.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Treasures of <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> wickedness profit nothing: but righteousness delivereth from death.</span><p>(a) That is, wickedly gotten.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/10.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2</span>. <span class="ital">Treasures of wickedness … righteousness</span>] The contrast would seem to be between “wickedness” in its highest prosperity and success, when it has amassed “treasures,” when it has “found all precious substance and filled the house with spoil” (<a href="/proverbs/1-13.htm" title="We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil:">Proverbs 1:13</a>), and “righteousness,” in itself considered, independently of the consequences which may attach to it.

To know no &#1499;&#1500;&#1502;&#1492; would be equivalent to, to let no shaming from without influence one; for shamelessness the poet would have made use of the expression &#1493;&#1489;&#1500;&#1470;&#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;. In &#1493;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1492; the declaration regarding the subject beginning with &#1492;&#1493;&#1502;&#1497;&#1492; is continued: Folly also has a house in which works of folly are carried one, and has set herself down by the door (&#1500;&#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1495; as &#1500;&#1508;&#1497;, <a href="/proverbs/8-3.htm">Proverbs 8:3</a>) of this house; she sits there &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1468;&#1488;. Most interpreters here think on a throne (lxx &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;, used especially of the sella curulis); and Zckler, as Umbreit, Hitzig, and others, connecting genitiv. therewith &#1502;&#1512;&#1502;&#1497; &#1511;&#1512;&#1514;, changes in 14b the scene, for he removes the "high throne of the city" from the door of the house to some place elsewhere. But the sitting is in contrast to the standing and going on the part of Wisdom on the streets preaching (Evagrius well renders: in molli ignavaque sella); and if &#1499;&#1505;&#1488; and house-door are named along with each other, the former is a seat before the latter, and the accentuation rightly separates by Mugrash &#1499;&#1505;&#1488; from &#1502;&#1512;&#1502;&#1497; &#1511;&#1512;&#1514;. "According to the accents and the meaning, &#1502;&#1512;&#1502;&#1497; &#1511;&#1512;&#1514; is the acc. loci: on the high places of the city, as <a href="/proverbs/8-2.htm">Proverbs 8:2</a>." (Fl.). They are the high points of the city, to which, as Wisdom, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/9-3.htm">Proverbs 9:3</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/8-2.htm">Proverbs 8:2</a>, so also Folly, her rival (wherefore <a href="/ecclesiastes/10-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:6</a> does not appertain to this place), invites followers to herself. She sits before her door to call &#1500;&#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497; &#1491;&#1512;&#1498; (with Munach, as in Cod. 1294 and old editions, without the Makkeph), those who go along the way (genitive connection with the supposition of the accusative construction, transire viam, as <a href="/proverbs/2-7.htm">Proverbs 2:7</a>), to call (invite) &#1492;&#1502;&#1497;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; (to be pointed with &#1502; raphatum and Gaja going before, according to Ben-Asher's rule; vid., Methegsetz. 20), those who make straight their path, i.e., who go straight on, directly before them (cf. <a href="/isaiah/57-2.htm">Isaiah 57:2</a>). The participial construction (the schemes amans Dei and amans Deum), as well as that of the verb &#1511;&#1512;&#1488; (first with the dat. and then with the accus.), interchange. </body></html>
