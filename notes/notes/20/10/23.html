That wealth which is truly desirable, has no vexation of spirit in the enjoyment; no grief for the loss; no guilt by the abuse of it. What comes from the love of God, has the grace of God for its companion. 23. Only foolish and wicked men divert themselves with doing harm to others, or tempting to sin. 24. The largest desire of eternal blessings the righteous can form, will be granted. 25. The course of prosperous sinners is like a whirlwind, which soon spends itself, and is gone. 26. As vinegar sets the teeth on edge, and as the smoke causes the eyes to smart, so the sluggard vexes his employer. 27,28. What man is he that loves life?

To do any injury to the persons and properties of men; which shows a most wicked and malicious spirit, a very depraved nature indeed: or rather "to commit sin" (o) of any sort, which he has devised in his own heart; it is as a "laughing" (p), as the words may be rendered; it is a laughing matter to him, he commits sin, and, when he has done it, laughs at it; instead of being ashamed of it, and humbled for it, he makes a mock at it, and a jest of it, as well as of all religion, and of the reproofs and admonitions of good men. Sin is pastime, he takes as much delight and pleasure in it as men do in their sports, and commits it as openly and freely; yea, not only takes pleasure in doing it himself, but in them that do it; see <a href="/proverbs/14-9.htm">Proverbs 14:9</a>; <p>but a man of understanding hath wisdom; to avoid sin, and not to do it, which is true wisdom, <a href="/job/28-28.htm">Job 28:28</a>; for he has, as it may be rendered, from the use of the word in the Arabic language (q), a "bridle" or "restraint" upon him, that he cannot do mischief and delight in it, as the fool does: or "so is wisdom to a man of understanding" (r); that is, to do it; as it is a pleasure to a feel to commit sin, so it is a delight to an understanding man to do that which is wise and good; it is "meat and drink" to do the will of God, see <a href="/john/4-34.htm">John 4:34</a>; he takes as much pleasure in it as men can do in their sports and pastimes; he has a truer pleasure and a better relish than they have; he delights in the law of God after the inward man; and Wisdom's ways, or the ways of Christ, are pleasantness to him; he runs the ways of his commandments with great alacrity and cheerfulness. <p>(o)  "facere scelus", Montanus, Baynus, Junius &amp; Tremellius, Cocceius, Michaelis; "perpetrare scelus", Piscator; "patrare facinus", Schultens.

The wisdom intended is practical religion, the fear of God directing and showing itself in daily action.

The seventeenth verse introduces the transition:<p>17 There is a way to life when one gives heed to correction;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And whoever disregards instruction runs into error.<p>Instead of &#1488;&#1512;&#1495; &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; (<a href="/proverbs/5-6.htm">Proverbs 5:6</a>), there is here &#1488;&#1512;&#1495; &#1500;&#1495;&#1497;&#1497;&#1501;; and then this proverb falls into rank with <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/10-16.htm">Proverbs 10:16</a>, which contains the same word &#1500;&#1495;&#1497;&#1497;&#1501;. The accentuation denotes &#1488;&#1512;&#1495; as subst.; for &#1488;&#1512;&#1495; way, road  equals  &#1488;&#1512;&#1495; [a wayfarer, part. of &#1488;&#1512;&#1495;] would, as &#1513;&#1473;&#1505;&#1506;, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/11-7.htm">Leviticus 11:7</a>, &#1504;&#1496;&#1506;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/94-9.htm">Psalm 94:9</a>, have the tone on the ultima. It is necessary neither to change the tone, nor, with Ewald, to interpret &#1488;&#1512;&#1495; as abstr. pro concreto, like &#1492;&#1500;&#1498;, for the expression "wanderer to life" has no support in the Mishle. Michaelis has given the right interpretation: via ad vitam est si quis custodiat disciplinam. The syntactical contents, however, are different, as e.g., <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-13.htm">1 Samuel 2:13</a>, where the participle has the force of a hypothetical clause; for the expression: "a way to life is he who observes correction," is equivalent to: he is on the way to life who...; a variety of the manner of expression: "the porch was twenty cubits," <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/3-4.htm">2 Chronicles 3:4</a>, particularly adapted to the figurative language of proverbial poetry, as if the poet said: See there one observant of correction - that (viz., the &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512; [&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;, to watch] representing itself in this &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;) is the way to life. &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1512; and &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1499;&#1495;&#1514; are related to each other as &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; and &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;; &#1506;&#1494;&#1489; [&#1506;&#1494;&#1489;, to leave, forsake] is equivalent to &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;. &#1502;&#1514;&#1506;&#1492; would be unsuitable as a contrast in the causative sense: who guides wrong, according to which Bertheau understands 17a, that only he who observes correction can guide others to life. We expect to hear what injuries he who thinks to raise himself above all reproach brings on himself. Hitzig, in his Commentary (1858), for this reason places the Hithpa. &#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492; (rather write &#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492;) in the place of the Hiph.; but in the Comm. on Jeremiah (1866), 42:20, he rightly remarks: "To err, not as an involuntary condition, but as an arbitrary proceeding, is suitably expressed by the Hiph." In like manner &#1492;&#1493;&#1505;&#1497;&#1507;, &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1506; (to touch), &#1492;&#1512;&#1495;&#1497;&#1511; (to go to a distance), denote the active conduct of a being endowed with reason; Ewald, 122, c. Jewish interpreters gloss &#1502;&#1514;&#1506;&#1492; by supplying &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;; but it signifies only as inwardly transitive, to accomplish the action of the &#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514;. </body></html>
