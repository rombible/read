The mothers of kings especially were treated with marked respect, receiving the title of “queen-mother.” (Comp. <a href="/1_kings/2-19.htm" title="Bathsheba therefore went to king Solomon, to speak to him for Adonijah.

It must be acknowledged, some have doubted whether Lemuel was not a different person; but, according to Dr. Delaney and many others, without sufficient reason. “I know,” says that judicious divine: “that some modern critics, contrary to the unanimous judgment and tradition of all antiquity, have raised some scruples upon this head, as if Lemuel were not Solomon, but some other king, they know not who. I have examined them with all the care and candour I am capable of, and conclude, upon the whole, that their objections are such as my readers, of best understandings, would be little obliged to me either for retailing or refuting.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/31.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>31:1-9 When children are under the mother's eye, she has an opportunity of fashioning their minds aright. Those who are grown up, should often call to mind the good teaching they received when children. The many awful instances of promising characters who have been ruined by vile women, and love of wine, should warn every one to avoid these evils. Wine is to be used for want or medicine. Every creature of God is good, and wine, though abused, has its use. By the same rule, due praise and consolation should be used as cordials to the dejected and tempted, not administered to the confident and self-sufficient. All in authority should be more carefully temperate even than other men; and should be protectors of those who are unable or afraid to plead their own cause. Our blessed Lord did not decline the bitterest dregs of the cup of sorrow put into his hands; but he puts the cup of consolation into the hands of his people, and causes those to rejoice who are in the deepest distress.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/31.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That his mother taught him - Compare <a href="/proverbs/1-8.htm">Proverbs 1:8</a>; <a href="/proverbs/6-20.htm">Proverbs 6:20</a>.

Not what were spoken by him, but what were spoken to him; or declaring what his mother said, as what follows shows; of this king we have no account elsewhere under this name. Grotius thinks that King Hezekiah, whose mother Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah, whom he supposes to be a wise man, from whom she had learned much, instructed her son in the following manner; but gives no other reason for this conjecture but that this chapter follows the collection of proverbs made by the men of Hezekiah; but they are expressly said to be Solomon's, and the words of Agur more immediately follow them; and besides Hezekiah does not appear ever to be addicted to the vices this prince was; much more probable is the conjecture of Bishop Patrick, that he was a prince of another country, perhaps in Chaldea, since a Chaldee word is three times used in his mother's address to him, and another word in a Chaldee termination; and he supposes his mother to be a Jewish lady, that taught her son the lessons herein contained. But the general sense of Jewish and Christian writers is, that Solomon himself is meant; whose name Lemuel is either a corruption of his name Solomon, a fond pretty name his mother Bathsheba gave him when young, and he thought fit to write it just as his mother spoke it; as mothers often do give such broken names to their children in fond affection to them: or it was another name of his, as it appears he had more than one; it signifies "to God", one that was devoted to him, as he was by his parents and by himself; or one that belonged to God, was his, as Solomon was; he was beloved of God, and therefore called Jedidiah, <a href="/2_samuel/12-24.htm">2 Samuel 12:24</a>; one to whom God was a father, and he a son to him; and he was chosen and appointed by him to succeed his father David in the kingdom, <a href="/2_samuel/7-13.htm">2 Samuel 7:13</a>. Hillerus (a) makes the word to signify "over against God", or "before the face of the first", or of God and was a type of the "angel of faces", or of God's presence, <a href="/isaiah/63-9.htm">Isaiah 63:9</a>; <p>the prophecy that his mother taught him; either in his youth, or when he was come to the throne; to whom she had access, and with whom she used freedom; and particularly when she saw he was inclined unto, or going into, the vices she cautions him against. Her instruction is called a "prophecy", because she delivered it on a foresight of the sins her son would be tempted with, and liable to fall into; and this foresight was either through her natural sagacity, or under a spirit of prophecy; or rather it is so called, because any wise saying, or doctrine of moment and importance, and especially if it was by divine inspiration, was so called; see <a href="/proverbs/30-1.htm">Proverbs 30:1</a>; as Solomon tells us what his father David taught him, so here what his mother Bathsheba instructed him in; and it would have been well if he had taken the advice she gave him, and he gave to his son; see <a href="/proverbs/4-3.htm">Proverbs 4:3</a>. <p>(a) Onomastic.

On the other hand it indicates that the language spoken in Massa was not very dissimilar from that spoken in Palestine.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>VII. The Words of King Lemuel.

SECOND APPENDIX TO THE SECOND COLLECTION, containing "the words of Lemuel" on the subjects of impurity and intemperance. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">superscription. <span class="cmt_word"></span>The words of King Lemuel, the prophecy which his mother taught him.</span> Who is intended by "Lemuel king" is much disputed. Those who connect the following word <span class="accented">massa</span> ("oracle") with the preceding <span class="accented">melek</span> ("king"), translate "King of Massa," as <a href="/proverbs/30-1.htm">Proverbs 30:1</a> (where see note). Of the country, or the king, or his mother, we have absolutely no information. The name Lemuel, or Lemoel (ver. 4), means "unto God," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> dedicated to God, like Lael (<a href="/numbers/3-24.htm">Numbers 3:24</a>); hence it is regarded by many authorities, ancient and modern, as an appellation of Solomon, one from infancy dedicated to God and celled by him Jedidiah, "beloved of the Lord" (<a href="/2_samuel/12-25.htm">2 Samuel 12:25</a>). But there is nothing in the contents of this section to confirm this idea; indeed, there are expressions which militate against it. Possibly Hezekiah may be meant, and his remarkable piety somewhat confirms the opinion; yet we see no reason why he should be here addressed under a pseudonym, especially if we consider that he himself was concerned in making this collection. On the whole, it seems best to take Lemuel as a symbolical name, designating an ideal king, to whom an ideal mother addressed the exhortation which follows. Solomon's own proverbs contain many warnings against the very sins of which this mother speaks, so that the section is conceived in the spirit of the earlier portion of the book, though it is assigned to a different author and another age. <span class="accented">The prophecy</span> (<span class="accented">massa</span>); the inspired utterance (see on ch. 30:1). This maternal counsel forms one compact exhortation, which might with more propriety be so termed than the words of Agur. <span class="accented">His mother.</span> The mother of a reigning king was always regarded with the utmost respect, taking precedence of the king's wife. Hence we so often find the names of kings' mothers in the sacred record; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="/1_kings/2-19.htm">1 Kings 2:19</a>; <a href="/1_kings/14-21.htm">1 Kings 14:21</a>; <a href="/1_kings/15-2.htm">1 Kings 15:2</a>; <a href="/2_kings/12-1.htm">2 Kings 12:1</a>. It is difficult to say what reading was seen by the LXX., who render, "My words have been spoken by God, the oracle of a king whom his mother instructed." There are many wise women mentioned in Scripture; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Miriam, Deborah, the Queen of Sheba, Huldah, etc., so there is nothing incongruous in Lemuel being instructed by his mother in wisdom. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/30.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In this verse the expression wavers in a way that is with difficulty determinable between &#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1502;&#1497;&#1514; and &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1502;&#1497;&#1514;. The Edd. of Opitz Jablonski and Van der Hooght have '&#1513;&#1474;&#1501;, but the most, from the Venetian 1521 to Nissel, have '&#1513;&#1473;&#1501; (vid., Mhlau, p. 69). The Codd. also differ as to the reading of the word; thus the Codd. Erfurt 2 and 3 have '&#1513;&#1474;&#1501;, but Cod. 1294 has '&#1513;&#1473;&#1501;. Isaak Tschelebi and Moses Algazi, in their writings regarding words with &#1513;&#1473; and &#1513;&#1474; (Constant. 1723 and 1799), prefer '&#1513;&#1474;&#1501;, and so also do Mordecai Nathan in his Concordance (1563-4), David de Pomis (1587), and Norzi. An important evidence is the writing &#1505;&#1502;&#1502;&#1497;&#1514;, Schabbath 77b, but it is as little decisive as &#1505;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503; [coat of mail], used by <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-4.htm">Jeremiah 44:4</a>, is decisive against the older expression &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503;. But what kind of a beast is meant here is a question. The swallow is at once to be set aside, as the Venet. translates (&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bd;) after Kimchi, who explains after Abulwald, but not without including himself, that the Heb. word for (Arab.) khuttaf (which is still the name given to the swallow from its quickness of motion), according to Haja's testimony, is much rather &#1505;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514;, a name for the swallow; which also the Arab. (Freytag, ii. p. 368) and the modern Syriac confirm; besides, in old Heb. it has the name of &#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505; or &#1505;&#1497;&#1505; (from Arab. shash, to fly confusedly hither and thither). In like manner the ape (Aben Ezra, Meri, Immanuel) is to be set aside, for this is called &#1511;&#1493;&#1507; (Indian kapi, kap, kamp, to move inconstantly and quickly up and down),<p>(Note: Vid., A Weber's Indische Studien, i. pp. 217, 343.)<p>and appears here admissible only on the ground that from &#1489;&#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; &#1514;&#1514;&#1508;&#1513;&#1474; they read that the beast had a resemblance to man. There remains now only the lizard (lxx, Jerome) and the spider (Luther) to be considered. The Talmud, Schabbath 77b, reckons five instances in which fear of the weaker pursues the stronger: one of these instances is &#1488;&#1497;&#1502;&#1514; &#1505;&#1504;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514;&#1506;&#1500; &#1492;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, another &#1488;&#1497;&#1502;&#1514; &#1505;&#1502;&#1502;&#1497;&#1514; &#1506;&#1500; &#1492;&#1506;&#1511;&#1512;&#1489;. The swallow, thus Rashi explains, creeps under the wings of the eagle and hinders it from spreading them out in its flight; and the spider (araigne) creeps into the ear of the scorpion; or also: a bruised spider applied heals the scorpion's sting. A second time the word occurs, Sanhedrin 103b, where it is said of King Amon that he burnt the To&#770;ra, and that over the altar came a &#1513;&#1502;&#1502;&#1497;&#1514; (here with &#1513;), which Rashi explains of the spider (a spider's web). But Aruch testifies that in these two places of the Talmud the explanation is divided between ragnatelo (spider) and (Ital.) lucrta (lizard). For the latter, he refers to <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/11-30.htm">Leviticus 11:30</a>, where &#1500;&#1496;&#1488;&#1492; (also explained by Rashi by lzard) in the Jerus. Targ. is rendered<p>(Note: The Samaritan has, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/11-30.htm">Leviticus 11:30</a>, &#1513;&#1502;&#1502;&#1497;&#1514; for &#1488;&#1504;&#1511;&#1492;, and the Syr. translates the latter word by &#1488;&#1502;&#1511;&#1514;&#1488;, which is used in the passage before us (cf. Geiger's Urschrift, p. 68f.) for &#1513;&#1502;&#1502;&#1497;&#1514;; omakto (Targ. akmetha) appears there to mean, not a spider, but a lizard.)<p>by &#1513;&#1502;&#1502;&#1497;&#1514;&#1488; (the writing here also varies between &#1513;&#1473; and &#1513;&#1474; or &#1505;). Accordingly, and after the lxx and Jerome, it may be regarded as a confirmed tradition that &#1513;&#1502;&#1502;&#1497;&#1514; means not the spider, for which the name &#1506;&#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; is coined, but the lizard, and particularly the stellion (spotted lizard). Thus the later language used it as a word still living (plur. &#1505;&#1502;&#1502;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, Sifre, under <a href="/deuteronomy/33-19.htm">Deuteronomy 33:19</a>). The Arab. also confirms this name as applicable to the lizard.<p>(Note: Perhaps also the modern Greek, &#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; (&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, &#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;), which Grotius compares.)<p>"To this day in Syria and in the Desert it is called samawiyyat, probably not from poison, but from samawah  equals  &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1502;&#1492;, the wilderness, because the beast is found only in the stony heaps of the Kharab" (Mhlau after Wetzstein). If this derivation is correct, then &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1502;&#1497;&#1514; is to be regarded as an original Heb. expression; but the lizard's name, samm, which, without doubt, designates the animal as poisonous (cf. &#1505;&#1501;, samam, samm, vapour, poisonous breath, poison), favours Schultens' view: &#1513;&#1502;&#1502;&#1497;&#1514;  equals  (Arab.) samamyyat, afflatu interficiens, or generally venenosa. In the expression &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; &#1514;&#1468;&#1514;&#1508;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;, Schultens, Gesenius, Ewald, Hitzig, Geier, and others, understand &#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; of the two fore-feet of the lizard: "the lizard feels (or: seizes) with its two hands;" but granting that &#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; is used of the fifteen feet of the stellio, or of the climbing feet of any other animal (lxx &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;  equals  &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;), yet it is opposed by this explanation, that in line first of this fourth distich an expression regarding the smallness of the weakness of the beast is to be expected, as at 25a, 26a, and 27a. And since, besides, &#1514;&#1508;&#1513;&#1474; with &#1489;&#1497;&#1491; or &#1489;&#1499;&#1507; always means "to catch" or "seize" (<a href="/ezekiel/21-16.htm">Ezekiel 21:16</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/29-7.htm">Ezekiel 29:7</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/38-23.htm">Jeremiah 38:23</a>), so the sense according to that explanation is: the lizard thou canst catch with the hand, and yet it is in kings' palaces, i.e., it is a little beast, which one can grasp with his hand, and yet it knows how to gain an entrance into palaces, by which in its nimbleness and cunning this is to be thought of, that it can scale the walls even to the summit (Aristoph. Nubes 170). To read &#1514;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1513;&#1474; with Mhlau, after Bttcher, recommends itself by this, that in &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474; one misses the suff. pointing back (&#1514;&#1468;&#1514;&#1508;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;); also why the intensive of &#1514;&#1508;&#1513;&#1474; is used, is not rightly comprehended. Besides, the address makes the expression more animated; cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/7-25.htm">Isaiah 7:25</a>, &#1514;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488;. In the lxx as it lies before us, the two explanations spoken of are mingled together: &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; ( equals  &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;) &#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c9;&#787;&#768;&#x3bd;... This &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c9;&#787;&#768;&#x3bd; (Symmachus, &#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;) hits the sense of 28a. In &#1492;&#1497;&#1499;&#1500;&#1497; &#1502;&#1500;&#1498;, &#1502;&#1500;&#1498; is not the genit. of possession, as at <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/45-9.htm">Psalm 45:9</a>, but of description (Hitzig), as at <a href="/amos/7-13.htm">Amos 7:13</a>. </body></html>
