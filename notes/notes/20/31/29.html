She is very careful to recommend herself to her husband's esteem and affection, to know his mind, and is willing that he rule over her. 1. She can be trusted, and he will leave such a wife to manage for him. He is happy in her. And she makes it her constant business to do him good. 2. She is one that takes pains in her duties, and takes pleasure in them. She is careful to fill up time, that none be lost. She rises early. She applies herself to the business proper for her, to women's business. She does what she does, with all her power, and trifles not. 3. She makes what she does turn to good account by prudent management. Many undo themselves by buying, without considering whether they can afford it. She provides well for her house. She lays up for hereafter. 4. She looks well to the ways of her household, that she may oblige all to do their duty to God and one another, as well as to her. 5. She is intent upon giving as upon getting, and does it freely and cheerfully. 6. She is discreet and obliging; every word she says, shows she governs herself by the rules of wisdom. She not only takes prudent measures herself, but gives prudent advice to others. The law of love and kindness is written in the heart, and shows itself in the tongue. Her heart is full of another world, even when her hands are most busy about this world. 7. Above all, she fears the Lord. Beauty recommends none to God, nor is it any proof of wisdom and goodness, but it has deceived many a man who made his choice of a wife by it. But the fear of God reigning in the heart, is the beauty of the soul; it lasts for ever. 8. She has firmness to bear up under crosses and disappointments. She shall reflect with comfort when she comes to be old, that she was not idle or useless when young. She shall rejoice in a world to come. She is a great blessing to her relations. If the fruit be good, the tree must have our good word. But she leaves it to her own works to praise her. Every one ought to desire this honour that cometh from God; and according to this standard we all ought to regulate our judgments. This description let all women daily study, who desire to be truly beloved and respected, useful and honourable. This passage is to be applied to individuals, but may it not also be applied to the church of God, which is described as a virtuous spouse? God by his grace has formed from among sinful men a church of true believers, to possess all the excellences here described.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/31.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The words of praise which the husband <a href="/proverbs/31-28.htm">Proverbs 31:28</a> is supposed to have addressed to the ideal wife.<p>Virtuously - The Hebrew word has primarily (like "virtus") the idea of "strength," but is used with various shades of meaning. Here (as in <a href="/proverbs/12-4.htm">Proverbs 12:4</a>; <a href="/ruth/3-11.htm">Ruth 3:11</a>) the strength is that of character stedfast in goodness. In other passages (e. g., <a href="/genesis/34-29.htm">Genesis 34:29</a>; <a href="/psalms/49-10.htm">Psalm 49:10</a>) it has the sense of "riches," and is so taken here by the Septuagint and Vulgate, see also the marginal rendering. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/31.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>29.

This, according to Aben Ezra and Gersom, is what was said by her husband and children, and which seems to be right; especially they may be thought to be the words of her husband. By these "daughters" may be meant false churches, such as the church of Rome and her daughters, who is the mother of harlots, <a href="/revelation/17-17.htm">Revelation 17:17</a>. These are "many", when the true church of Christ is but one, to whom she is opposed, Sol 6:8. These may do many virtuous things externally; may make a great show of religion and devotion; may have a form of godliness, without the power of it; and a name to live, and be dead. The Vulgate Latin version renders it, "many daughters have gathered riches"; or "have possessed riches", as the Septuagint, Syriac, and Arabic versions, and so the Targum; and in this sense the phrase is sometimes used for getting riches and wealth; see <a href="/deuteronomy/8-17.htm">Deuteronomy 8:17</a>; and may well be applied to the false churches, the church of Rome and her daughters, who possess great riches and large emoluments, which yet in a short time will come to nothing, <a href="/revelation/18-17.htm">Revelation 18:17</a>; <p>but thou excellest them all; in real beauty, in true riches, in purity of doctrine, in simplicity of worship, in holiness of life and conversation, in undefiled religion, in doing good works, properly so called. Christ's church is "the fairest among women", Sol 1:8. So Ambrose interprets the daughters of heresies and heretics. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/31.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them all.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/31.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">29</span>. <span class="ital">done virtuously</span>] This rendering, which recalls the same word in <span class="ital"><a href="/proverbs/31-10.htm" title="Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price is far above rubies.">Proverbs 31:10</a></span> (“a woman of <span class="ital">virtue</span>,” “have done <span class="ital">virtue</span>”), is much to be preferred to the rendering of LXX. and Vulg. and A.V. marg., <span class="ital">gotten riches</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">excellest them all</span>] Regarded as the commendation of her husband and children, this is true to nature, and it accords better with their partial, or at any rate limited view, than with the wider range of the author himself. “With him <span class="ital">every</span> virtuous woman would merit such meed of praise.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">29–31</span>. This concluding paragraph may be regarded either as the comment of the author himself upon the picture he has just drawn, or as being the actual words of the “praise” bestowed by her husband and her children upon the “virtuous woman.” The latter view is taken by R.V., which introduces the paragraph by the word <span class="ital">saying</span>, at the end of the preceding verse.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - RESH. <span class="cmt_word">Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them all</span>. The versions and some commentators take the encomium in the mean and restricted sense of praise for the acquisition of riches.  Thus the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Multae filiae congregaverunt divitias</span>; Septuagint, "Many daughters have obtained wealth." But it adds another rendering, "Many have wrought power (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>)," which is nearer the meaning in this place. <span class="accented">Chayil</span> (as we have seen, ver. 10) means "force," <span class="accented">virtus</span>, "strength of character" shown in various ways (comp. <a href="/numbers/24-18.htm">Numbers 24:18</a>; <a href="/psalms/60-12.htm">Psalm 60:12</a>). "Daughters," equivalent to "women," as <a href="/genesis/30-13.htm">Genesis 30:13</a>; <a href="/songs/6-9.htm">Song of Solomon 6:9</a>. Roman Catholic commentators have, with much ingenuity, applied the whole description of the virtuous woman, and especially the present verse, to the Virgin Mary. We may regard it as a representation of the truly Christian matron, who loves husband and children, guides the house, is discreet, chaste, good, a teacher of good things (<a href="/1_timothy/5-14.htm">1 Timothy 5:14</a>; <a href="/titus/2-3.htm">Titus 2:3</a>, etc.). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/31.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Now, first, the description turns back to the husband, of the woman who is commended, mentioned in the introduction:<p>23 &#1504; 32 Well known in the gates is her husband,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where he sitteth among the elders of the land.<p>Such a wife is, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/12-4.htm">Proverbs 12:4</a>, &#1506;&#1496;&#1512;&#1514; &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468;, - she advances the estimation and the respect in which her husband is held. He has, in the gates where the affairs of the city are deliberated upon, a well-known, reputable name; for there he sits, along with the elders of the land, who are chosen into the council of the city as the chief place of the land, and has a weighty voice among them. The phrase wavers between &#1504;&#1493;&#1491;&#1506; (lxx &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;; Venet. &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;) and &#1504;&#1493;&#1491;&#1506;.
