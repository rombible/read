She is very careful to recommend herself to her husband's esteem and affection, to know his mind, and is willing that he rule over her. 1. She can be trusted, and he will leave such a wife to manage for him. He is happy in her. And she makes it her constant business to do him good. 2. She is one that takes pains in her duties, and takes pleasure in them. She is careful to fill up time, that none be lost. She rises early. She applies herself to the business proper for her, to women's business. She does what she does, with all her power, and trifles not. 3. She makes what she does turn to good account by prudent management. Many undo themselves by buying, without considering whether they can afford it. She provides well for her house. She lays up for hereafter. 4. She looks well to the ways of her household, that she may oblige all to do their duty to God and one another, as well as to her. 5. She is intent upon giving as upon getting, and does it freely and cheerfully. 6. She is discreet and obliging; every word she says, shows she governs herself by the rules of wisdom. She not only takes prudent measures herself, but gives prudent advice to others. The law of love and kindness is written in the heart, and shows itself in the tongue. Her heart is full of another world, even when her hands are most busy about this world. 7. Above all, she fears the Lord. Beauty recommends none to God, nor is it any proof of wisdom and goodness, but it has deceived many a man who made his choice of a wife by it. But the fear of God reigning in the heart, is the beauty of the soul; it lasts for ever. 8. She has firmness to bear up under crosses and disappointments. She shall reflect with comfort when she comes to be old, that she was not idle or useless when young. She shall rejoice in a world to come. She is a great blessing to her relations. If the fruit be good, the tree must have our good word. But she leaves it to her own works to praise her. Every one ought to desire this honour that cometh from God; and according to this standard we all ought to regulate our judgments. This description let all women daily study, who desire to be truly beloved and respected, useful and honourable. This passage is to be applied to individuals, but may it not also be applied to the church of God, which is described as a virtuous spouse? God by his grace has formed from among sinful men a church of true believers, to possess all the excellences here described.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/31.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The verse points to a large sphere of feminine activity, strikingly in contrast with the degradation to which woman in the East has now fallen. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/31.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17, 18.

Showing her readiness to every good work; and with what cheerfulness, spirit, and resolution, she set about it, and with what dispatch and expedition she performed it: the allusion is to the girding and tucking up of long garments, wore in the eastern countries, when any work was set about in earnest, which required dispatch; see <a href="/luke/17-8.htm">Luke 17:8</a>; the strength of creatures being in their loins, <a href="/job/40-16.htm">Job 40:16</a>; the loins are sometimes put for strength, as in Plautus (r); and the sense is much the same with what follows; <p>and strengtheneth her arms; does all she finds to do with all her might and main, as the church does; not in her own strength, but in the strength of Christ; to whom she seeks for it, and in whose strength she goes forth about her business; by whom the arms of her hands are made strong, even by the mighty God of Jacob; and because she thus applies to him for it, she is said to do it herself, <a href="/genesis/49-24.htm">Genesis 49:24</a>; here she plays the man, and acts the manly part, <a href="/1_corinthians/16-13.htm">1 Corinthians 16:13</a>. <p>(r) "Lumbos defractos velim", Stichus, <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/2.htm">Acts 2</a>.

This seems at first sight a strange assertion to make concerning one of the weaker sex; but the phrase is metaphorically expressive of the energy and force with which she prepares herself for her work. Strength and vigour are, as it were, the girdle which she binds round her waist to enable her to conduct her operations with case and freedom. So we have a similar metaphor boldly applied to God (<a href="/psalms/93-1.htm">Psalm 93:1</a>): "The Lord reigneth, he is apparelled with majesty; the Lord is  apparelled, he hath girded himself with strength" (cf. <a href="/job/38-3.htm">Job 38:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Strengtheneth her arms</span>.

Rdiger in Gesenius' Thes.). Thus also in our "kriegen"  equals  to come into possession, the reference to war disappears. Hitzig understands by &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1500;, the continual prosperity of the man on account of his fortunate possession of such a wife; but in that case the poet should have said &#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1495;&#1514; &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1500;; for &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1500; is gain, not the feeling that is therewith connected. There is here meant the gain, profit, which the housewife is the means of bringing in (cf. <a href="/psalms/78-13.htm">Psalm 78:13</a>). The heart of her husband (&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468;) can be at rest, it can rest on her whom it loves - he goes after his calling, perhaps a calling which, though weighty and honourable, brings in little or nothing; but the wife keeps the family possessions scrupulously together, and increases them by her laborious and prudent management, so that there is not wanting to him gain, which he properly did not acquire, but which the confidence he is justified in reposing in his wife alone brings to him. She is to him a perpetual spring of nothing but good. </body></html>
