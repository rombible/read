She is very careful to recommend herself to her husband's esteem and affection, to know his mind, and is willing that he rule over her. 1. She can be trusted, and he will leave such a wife to manage for him. He is happy in her. And she makes it her constant business to do him good. 2. She is one that takes pains in her duties, and takes pleasure in them. She is careful to fill up time, that none be lost. She rises early. She applies herself to the business proper for her, to women's business. She does what she does, with all her power, and trifles not. 3. She makes what she does turn to good account by prudent management. Many undo themselves by buying, without considering whether they can afford it. She provides well for her house. She lays up for hereafter. 4. She looks well to the ways of her household, that she may oblige all to do their duty to God and one another, as well as to her. 5. She is intent upon giving as upon getting, and does it freely and cheerfully. 6. She is discreet and obliging; every word she says, shows she governs herself by the rules of wisdom. She not only takes prudent measures herself, but gives prudent advice to others. The law of love and kindness is written in the heart, and shows itself in the tongue. Her heart is full of another world, even when her hands are most busy about this world. 7. Above all, she fears the Lord. Beauty recommends none to God, nor is it any proof of wisdom and goodness, but it has deceived many a man who made his choice of a wife by it. But the fear of God reigning in the heart, is the beauty of the soul; it lasts for ever. 8. She has firmness to bear up under crosses and disappointments. She shall reflect with comfort when she comes to be old, that she was not idle or useless when young. She shall rejoice in a world to come. She is a great blessing to her relations. If the fruit be good, the tree must have our good word. But she leaves it to her own works to praise her. Every one ought to desire this honour that cometh from God; and according to this standard we all ought to regulate our judgments. This description let all women daily study, who desire to be truly beloved and respected, useful and honourable. This passage is to be applied to individuals, but may it not also be applied to the church of God, which is described as a virtuous spouse? God by his grace has formed from among sinful men a church of true believers, to possess all the excellences here described.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/31.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Scarlet - Probably some well-known articles of dress, at once conspicuous for their color, or, as some think, for their double texture and warmth. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/31.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21. scarlet&#8212;or, "purple," by reason of the dyes used, the best fabrics; as a matter of taste also; the color suits cold.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/proverbs/31.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">She is not afraid of the snow, </span> or of any injuries of the weather. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">All her household are clothed with scarlet; </span> she hath provided enough, not only for their necessity and defence against cold and other inconveniences, which is here supposed, but also for their delight and ornament; so that not only herself, and husband, and children, but some of the better rank of her servants, wear scarlet; which was more cheap and familiar in those times and countries than now it is with us. Or, as it is rendered in our margin, and by divers others, <span class="ital">are clothed with double garments</span>, which is necessary and customary in cold seasons. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/proverbs/31.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>She is not afraid of the snow for her household,.... That her family should suffer through the rigour of a cold season, when it is frost and snow; <p>for all her household are clothed with scarlet: the Vulgate Latin version renders it, "with double" (u), that is, with double garments; and so the Septuagint and Arabic versions, joining the words to a following verse; and this, by some, is thought to be the better rendering of the words; since the scarlet colour is no fence against cold, no more than any other, whereas double garments are; and which may be applied to the garment of justification, or the robe of Christ's righteousness, as one; and to the garment of sanctification, internal and external, as the other; the one, even the righteousness of Christ, or Christ the Lord our righteousness, is an hiding place from the wind, and a covert from the storm; a sufficient shelter from the cold of snow, and all inclemencies of the weather; by which the vindictive wrath and justice of God may be signified: and the other is a screen from the malicious insinuations and reproaches of men. But had the word been designed to signify "double", it would have been in the "dual" number; as it is not, and is always used in this form for "scarlet"; and so the Targum, Jarchi, and Aben Ezra interpret it; which colour is an emblem of the blood of Christ, by which the church is justified, <a href="/romans/5-9.htm">Romans 5:9</a>; and all the household of faith, the whole family of Christ and household of God, are all justified by the same righteousness of Christ, consisting of his active and passive obedience, for the whole of which his crimson blood is put; it is a garment down to the feet, which covers all his people; they are all made righteous by the one obedience of Christ; they are all clothed in scarlet alike, all kings and priests unto God, all alike justified, and shall be glorified alike. The literal sense is, that if her household are clothed in scarlet in common; much more may it be thought that coarse and suitable garments would be provided for them, to protect them from the cold in winter (w). <p>(u) "indigitat vestem duplo crassiorem, Stockius, p. 1122.

There is no reason, however, to alter the word.

That its texture does not belie its appearance goes without saying.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - LAMED. <span class="cmt_word">She is not afraid of the snow for her household.</span> "Show," says Dr. Geikie ('Holy Land,' 2:58), "covers the streets of Jerusalem two winters in three, but it generally comes in small quantities, and soon disappears. Yet there are sometimes very snowy winters. That of 1879, for example, left behind it seventeen inches of snow, even where there was no  drift, and the strange spectacle of snow lying unmelted for two or three weeks was seen in the hollows on the hillsides. Thousands of years have wrought no change in this aspect of the winter months, for Bennaiah, one of David's mighty men, 'slew a lion in the midst of a pit in the time of snow' (<a href="/2_samuel/23-20.htm">2 Samuel 23:20</a>)." She has no fears concerning the comfort and health of her family even in the severest winter. <span class="cmt_word">For all her household are clothed with scarlet;</span> with warm garments. The word used is <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">shanim</span>), derived from a verb meaning "to shine," and denoting a crimson or deep scarlet colour. This colour was supposed, and rightly, to absorb and retain heat, as white to repel it; being made of wool, the garments would be warm as well as stately in appearance. St. Jerome has <span class="accented">duplicibus</span> (<span class="accented">shenaim</span>), "with double garments," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> with one over the other. Warm garments were the more necessary as the only means of heating rooms was the introduction of portable chafing dishes containing bunting charcoal (see <a href="/jeremiah/36-22.htm">Jeremiah 36:22</a>, etc). The Septuagint has taken liberties with the text, "Her husband is not anxious concerning domestic matters when he tarries anywhere [<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b7;</span> for which Delitzsch suggests <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;</span>], for all her household are well clothed." Spiritually, the Church fears not the severity of temptation or the chill of unbelief, when her children take refuge in the blood of Christ. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/31.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>With this diligence in her duties she is not a long sleeper, who is not awakened till the sun is up; but<p>15 &#1493; She riseth up while it is yet night,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And giveth food to her house,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the fixed portion to her maidens.<p>The fut. consec. express, if not a logical sequence of connection, yet a close inner binding together of the separate features of the character here described. Early, ere the morning dawns, such a housewife rises up, because she places care for her house above her own comfort; or rather, because this care is to her a satisfaction and a joy. Since now the poet means without doubt to say that she is up before the other inmates of the house, especially before the children, though not before the maids: we have not, in &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503;, to think that the inmates of the house, all in the morning night-watch, stand round about her, and that each receives from her a portion for the approaching day; but that she herself, early, whilst yet the most are asleep, gives out or prepares the necessary portions of food for the day (cf. &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503;, <a href="/isaiah/53-9.htm">Isaiah 53:9</a>). Regarding &#1496;&#1512;&#1507;, food, from &#1496;&#1512;&#1507; (to tear in pieces, viz., with the teeth), and regarding &#1495;&#1511;, a portion decreed, vid., at <a href="/proverbs/30-8.htm">Proverbs 30:8</a>. It is true that &#1495;&#1511; also means the appointed labour (pensum), and thus the day's work (&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; &#1497;&#1493;&#1501;); but the parallelism brings it nearer to explain after <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/30-8.htm">Proverbs 30:8</a>, as is done by Gesenius and Hitzig after <a href="/exodus/5-14.htm">Exodus 5:14</a>. </body></html>
