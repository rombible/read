Not only, Keep them, and you shall live; but, Keep them as those that cannot live without them. Those that blame strict and careful walking as needless and too precise, consider not that the law is to be kept as the apple of the eye; indeed the law in the heart is the eye of the soul. Let the word of God dwell in us, and so be written where it will be always at hand to be read. Thus we shall be kept from the fatal effects of our own passions, and the snares of Satan.

Ewald remarks: &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494; &#1500; stands here in its nearest signification of overlooking, whence first follows that of contemning. But this "nearest" signification is devised wholly in favour of this passage; - the interpretation, "they do not thus let the thief pass," is set aside by Sol 8:1, Sol 8:7; for by 31b, cf. Sol 8:7, and 34a, cf. Sol 8:6, it is proved that from <a href="/proverbs/6-30.htm">Proverbs 6:30</a> on, reminiscences from the Canticles, which belong to the literature of the Chokma, find their way into the Mashal language of the author. Hitzig's correct supposition, that &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494; &#1500; always signifies positive contemning, does not necessitate the interrogative interpretation: "Does not one despise the thief if...?" Thus to be understood, the author ought to have written &#1488;&#1507; &#1499;&#1497; or &#1490;&#1501; &#1499;&#1497;. Michaelis rightly: furtum licet merito pro infami in republica habetur, tamen si cum adulterio comparatur, minus probrosum est. Regarding &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; in the sense of appetite, and even throat and stomach, vid., Psychologie, p. 204. A second is, that the thief, if he is seized (but we regard &#1493;&#1504;&#1502;&#1510;&#1488; not as the hypoth. perf., but as the part. deprehensus), may make compensation for this crime. The fut. &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1501; thus to be understood as the potential lies near from this, that a sevenfold compensation of the thing stolen is unheard of in the Israelitish law; it knows only of a twofold, fourfold, fivefold restoration, <a href="/exodus/21-37.htm">Exodus 21:37</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/22-1.htm">Exodus 22:1-3</a>, <a href="/exodus/22-8.htm">Exodus 22:8</a> (cf. Saalschtz, Mos. Recht, p. 554ff.). This excess over that which the law rendered necessary leads into the region of free-will: he (the thief, by which we are now only to think of him whom bitter necessity has made such) may make compensation sevenfold, i.e., superabundantly; he may give up the whole possessions (vid., on &#1492;&#1493;&#1503; at <a href="/proverbs/1-13.htm">Proverbs 1:13</a>) of his house, so as not merely to satisfy the law, but to appease him against whom he has done wrong, and again to gain for himself an honoured name. What is said in <a href="/proverbs/6-30.htm">Proverbs 6:30</a> and <a href="/proverbs/6-31.htm">Proverbs 6:31</a> is perfectly just. One does not contemn a man who is a thief through poverty, he is pitied; while the adulterer goes to ruin under all circumstances of contempt and scorn. And: theft may be made good, and that abundantly; but adultery and its consequences are irreparable. </body></html>
