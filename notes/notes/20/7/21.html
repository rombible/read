<span class="ital">or as a fool to the correction of the stocks — </span>Or, which is more agreeable to the order of the words in the Hebrew text, as one in <span class="ital">fetters, </span>that is, bound with fetters, <span class="ital">to the correction of a fool, </span>namely, to receive such correction, or punishment, as belongs to fools. Which may imply, either, 1st, That he hath no more sense of the shame and mischief which he is bringing upon himself than a fool; or, 2d, That he can no more resist the temptation, or avoid the danger, than a man fast tied with chains and fetters can free himself, although his impotency be merely of a moral nature, and therefore voluntary. <span class="ital">Till a dart strike through his liver — </span>That is, his vital parts, whereof the liver is one.

Dr. Grey, making a slight alteration in the text, renders these verses thus: “He goeth straightway, as an ox goeth to the slaughter, as a dog to the chain, and as a deer, till a dart strike through his liver: as a bird hasteth,” &c. “He considers the passage as including four similes, the ox, the dog, the deer, the bird; each of them filly resembling the case of a youth, reduced by an adulterous woman, and hastening to ruin without fear or thought. The circumstance of the <span class="ital">dart, </span>as applied to the deer, is beautiful and proper, which otherwise we are at a loss to dispose of. The LXX. and Syriac read, <span class="ital">as a dog to the chains, or as a stag pierced through his liver with a dart.”</span><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:6-27 Here is an affecting example of the danger of youthful lusts. It is a history or a parable of the most instructive kind. Will any one dare to venture on temptations that lead to impurity, after Solomon has set before his eyes in so lively and plain a manner, the danger of even going near them? Then is he as the man who would dance on the edge of a lofty rock, when he has just seen another fall headlong from the same place. The misery of self-ruined sinners began in disregard to God's blessed commands. We ought daily to pray that we may be kept from running into temptation, else we invite the enemies of our souls to spread snares for us. Ever avoid the neighbourhood of vice. Beware of sins which are said to be pleasant sins. They are the more dangerous, because they most easily gain the heart, and close it against repentance. Do nothing till thou hast well considered the end of it. Were a man to live as long as Methuselah, and to spend all his days in the highest delights sin can offer, one hour of the anguish and tribulation that must follow, would far outweigh them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Fair speech - The Hebrew word is usually translated "doctrine," or "learning" <a href="/proverbs/1-5.htm">Proverbs 1:5</a>; <a href="/proverbs/4-2.htm">Proverbs 4:2</a>; <a href="/proverbs/9-9.htm">Proverbs 9:9</a>; possibly it is used here in keen irony. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21. caused &#8230; yield&#8212;or, "inclines."<p>flattering&#8212;(Compare Pr 5:3).<p>forced him&#8212;by persuasion overcoming his scruples.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/proverbs/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">With her much fair speech; </span> which implies that her alluring words were more effectual with him than her impudent kisses, which possibly had a little alienated his mind from her. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">She caused him to yield; </span> whereby he signifies that no provocation to sin is a sufficient excuse for sin. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">She forced him; </span> she prevailed over him; which argues that there was some reluctancy in his judgment or conscience against it. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/proverbs/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>With her much fair speech she caused him to yield,.... Or, "to decline" from the right way: or, "inclined him" (d); his ear to listen to her, and his heart to go after her and along with her. This she did, by using a great many words, by her prolixity, and by some taking and striking expressions; lewd women are generally very talkative (e). It may be rendered, "by her much doctrine" (f), as the word is in <a href="/proverbs/4-2.htm">Proverbs 4:2</a>; so Jezebel calls herself a prophetess, and sets up for a teacher of men; and, by her false doctrine, deceives some that are called the servants of Christ to commit fornication, and eat things sacrificed to idols, <a href="/revelation/2-20.htm">Revelation 2:20</a>; <p>with the flattering of her lips she forced him; to go along with her, not against his will, but with it: though at first there was some reluctance, conscience rose up and opposed; but her words, which were smoother than oil, found a way into his heart, and prevailed upon him to yield to her entreaties; he could no longer withstand her attacks, but surrendered to her; her charming voice, and flattering lips, had more effect upon him than her kisses; notwithstanding these he was reluctant, but could stand it out no longer against her alluring words and soothing language.

The Hebrew word means "doctrine, or learning" - devil's pleading (<a href="/proverbs/1-5.htm">Proverbs 1:5</a>; <a href="/proverbs/9-9.htm">Proverbs 9:9</a>). St. Jerome has <span class="accented">irretivit</span>, "she netted him;" Septuagint, "She caused him to go astray (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>) by much converse."

Then <span class="cmt_word">with the flattering of her lips she forced him;</span> <span class="accented">drew him away.</span> His body followed the lead of his blinded mind; he acceded to her solicitations.

But in view of the derivatives &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1502;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; and &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;, it is perhaps more appropriate to combine &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1501; with &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1501;, to discharge perfectly, and to translate it thank-payment-offering, or with v. Hofmann, a due-offering, where not directly thank-offering; for the proper eucharistic offering, which is the expression of thanks on a particular occasion, is removed from the species of the Shelamim by the addition of the words &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1491;&#1492; (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/7-12.htm">Leviticus 7:12-25</a>). The characteristic of the Shelamim is the division of the flesh of the sacrifice between Jahve and His priests on the one side, and the person (or persons) bringing it on the other side: only one part of the flesh of the sacrifice was Jahve's, consumed by fire (<a href="/leviticus/3-16.htm">Leviticus 3:16</a>); the priests received one part; those who brought the offering received back another part as it were from the altar of God, that they might eat it with holy joy along with their household. So here the adulteress says that there was binding upon her, in consequence of a vow she had taken, the duty of presenting peace-offerings, or offerings that were due; to-day (she reckons the day in the sense of the dies civilis from night to night) she has performed her duties, and the &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1502;&#1497; &#1504;&#1491;&#1512; have yielded much to her that she might therewith regale him, her true lover; for with &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1503; she means to say that even the prospect of the gay festival which she can prepare for him moved her thus to meet him. This address of the woman affords us a glimpse into the history of the customs of those times. The Shelamim meals degenerated in the same manner as our Kirmsen.<p>(Note: Kirmse  equals  anniversary of the dedication of a church, village fte.)<p>Secularization lies doubly near to merrymaking when the law sanctions this, and it can conceal itself behind the mask of piety. Regarding &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1512;, a more exact word for &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;, vid., at <a href="/proverbs/1-28.htm">Proverbs 1:28</a>. To seek the countenance of one is equivalent to to seek his person, himself, but yet not without reference to the wished-for look [aspectus] of the person. </body></html>
