It is a history or a parable of the most instructive kind. Will any one dare to venture on temptations that lead to impurity, after Solomon has set before his eyes in so lively and plain a manner, the danger of even going near them? Then is he as the man who would dance on the edge of a lofty rock, when he has just seen another fall headlong from the same place. The misery of self-ruined sinners began in disregard to God's blessed commands. We ought daily to pray that we may be kept from running into temptation, else we invite the enemies of our souls to spread snares for us. Ever avoid the neighbourhood of vice. Beware of sins which are said to be pleasant sins. They are the more dangerous, because they most easily gain the heart, and close it against repentance. Do nothing till thou hast well considered the end of it. Were a man to live as long as Methuselah, and to spend all his days in the highest delights sin can offer, one hour of the anguish and tribulation that must follow, would far outweigh them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Loud and stubborn - Both words describe the half-animal signs of a vicious nature.

The connection with <a href="/proverbs/7-5.htm">Proverbs 7:5</a> would be closer if instead of the extended Semitic construction it were said: nam quum ...prospicerem vidi, etc. &#1495;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1503; (from &#1495;&#1500;&#1500;, to bore through) is properly a place where the wall is bored through. &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1489; .hguor (from &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1489;  equals  Arab. shaniba, to be agreeable, cool, fresh) is the window-lattice or lattice-window, i.e., lattice for drawing down and raising up, which keeps off the rays of the sun. &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1507; signifies primarily to make oneself long in order to see, to stretch up or out the neck and the head, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;, Arab. atall, atal'a, and tatall'a of things, imminere, to overtop, to project, to jut in; cf. Arab. askaf of the ostrich, long and bent, with respect to the neck stretching it up, sakaf, abstr. crooked length. And &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1491; is thus used, as in Arab. duna, but not b'ad, is used: so placed, that one in relation to the other obstructs the avenue to another person or thing: "I looked forth from behind the lattice-window, i.e., with respect to the persons or things in the room, standing before the lattice-window, and thus looking out into the open air" (Fleischer). That it was far in the night, as we learn at <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/7-9.htm">Proverbs 7:9</a>, does not contradict this looking out; for apart from the moon, and especially the lighting of the streets, there were star-lit nights, and to see what the narrator saw there was no night of Egyptian darkness. But because it was night 6a is not to be translated: I looked about among those devoid of experience (thus e.g., Lwenstein); but he saw among these, observed among the youths, who thus late amused themselves without, a young man whose want of understanding was manifest from what further happened. Bertheau: that I might see, is syntactically impossible. The meaning of &#1493;&#1488;&#1512;&#1488; is not determined by the &#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492; following, but conversely &#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492; stands under the operation of &#1493; ( equals  &#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492;, <a href="/nehemiah/13-7.htm">Nehemiah 13:7</a>), characterizing the historic aorist.
