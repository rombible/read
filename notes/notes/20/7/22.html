It is a history or a parable of the most instructive kind. Will any one dare to venture on temptations that lead to impurity, after Solomon has set before his eyes in so lively and plain a manner, the danger of even going near them? Then is he as the man who would dance on the edge of a lofty rock, when he has just seen another fall headlong from the same place. The misery of self-ruined sinners began in disregard to God's blessed commands. We ought daily to pray that we may be kept from running into temptation, else we invite the enemies of our souls to spread snares for us. Ever avoid the neighbourhood of vice. Beware of sins which are said to be pleasant sins. They are the more dangerous, because they most easily gain the heart, and close it against repentance. Do nothing till thou hast well considered the end of it. Were a man to live as long as Methuselah, and to spend all his days in the highest delights sin can offer, one hour of the anguish and tribulation that must follow, would far outweigh them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>As a fool ... - literally, "As a fetter to the correction of a fool," the order of which is inverted in the King James Version The Septuagint, followed by the Syriac Version, has another reading, and interprets the clause: "As a dog, enticed by food, goes to the chain that is to bind him, so does the youth go to the temptress."

So such persons as are ensnared by harlots; they follow them in a view of pleasure, but it ends in ruin; if not in the loss of bodily life, by the revengeful husband or civil magistrate; yet in the destruction of their immortal souls; <p>or as a fool to the correction of the stocks; a drunken besotted fool, who, while he is leading to the stocks, is insensible whither he is going; but when he has been there awhile, and is come out of his drunken fit, then he is sensible of his punishment and his shame. Or, "as the stocks are for the correction of a fool" (h): or, as a man goes to "the stocks, to the correction of a fool" (i); so the young man went after the harlot: or, as "one fettered" (k), goes thither, bound hand and foot; he cannot help himself, nor avoid the shame. It denotes both the power of sin, there is no withstanding its allurements and blandishments, when once given way to, and the shame that attends or follows it.

The rendering of R.V. text, <span class="ital">as fetters to the correction of the fool</span>, is literal, and is taken to mean, as senselessly and as certainly as the dumb instruments of his punishment dog the steps of the fool. The alternative of R.V. marg., <span class="ital">as one in fetters</span>, is admissible in grammar, but loses the point of comparison, viz. his entire oblivion of consequences. The reading of the LXX., <span class="greekheb">ὥσπερ κύων ἐπὶ δεσμούς</span>, “as a dog to his chain,” keeps all three comparisons to animals, and at the same time favours the suggestion that the text is corrupt.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He teeth after her straightway;</span> <span class="accented">suddenly</span>, as though, casting aside all scruples, he gave himself up to the temptation, and with no further delay accompanied her to the house. Septuagint, "He followed, being cajoled (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span>), ensnared like a silly bird" (see the article on <span class="accented">Cepphus Larus</span>, in Erasmus's 'Adag ,' <span class="accented">s.v.</span> "Garrulitas"). As an ox goeth to the slaughter. He no more realizes the serious issue of his action than an irrational beast which, without prevision of the future, walks contentedly to the slaughter house, and is stupidly placid in the face of death. Or as a fool to the correction of the stocks. There is some  difficulty in the translation of this clause. The Authorized Version, with which Delitzsch virtually agrees, is obtained by transposition of the nouns, the natural rendering of the Hebrew being "as fetters to the correction of a fool." The sense thus obtained is obvious: the youth follows the woman, as a fool or a criminal is led unresisting to confinement and degradation. Doubtless there is some error in the text, as may be seen by comparison of the versions. Septuagint (with which the Syriac agrees), "As a dog to chains, or as a hart struck to the liver with an arrow;" Vulgate, "As a frisking lamb, and not knowing that as a fool he is being dragged to bondage." The commentators are much divided. Fleischer, "As if in fetters to the punishment of the fool," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of himself; Ewald, "As when a steel trap (springs up) for the correction of a fool," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> when a hidden trap suddenly catches an incautious person wandering where he has no business. The direct interpretation, that the youth follows the harlot, as fetters the proper punishment of fools, is unsatisfactory, because the parallelism leads us to expect a living being instead of "fetters." We are constrained to fall back on the Authorized Version as exhibiting the best mode of reconstructing a corrupt text. The youth, with his insensate passion, is compared to the madman or idiot who is taken away, unconscious of his fate, to a shameful deprivation of liberty. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Thus she found him, and described to him the enjoyment which awaited him in eating and drinking, then in the pleasures of love.<p>16 "My bed have I spread with cushions,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Variegated coverlets, Egyptian linen;<p>17 I have sprinkled my couch<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.<p>18 Come then, we will intoxicate ourselves with love till the morning,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And will satisfy ourselves in love."<p>The noun &#1506;&#1512;&#1513;&#1474;, from &#1506;&#1512;&#1513;&#1474;,  equals  Arab. 'arash, aedificare, fabricari, signifies generally the wooden frame; thus not so much the bed within as the erected bed-place (cf. Arab. 'arsh, throne, and 'arysh, arbour). This bedstead she had richly and beautifully cushioned, that it might be soft and agreeable. &#1512;&#1489;&#1491;, from &#1512;&#1489;, signifies to lay on or apply closely, thus either vincire (whence the name of the necklace, <a href="/genesis/41-42.htm">Genesis 41:42</a>) or sternere (different from &#1512;&#1508;&#1491;, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/17-13.htm">Job 17:13</a>, which acquires the meaning sternere from the root-meaning to raise up from under, sublevare), whence &#1502;&#1512;&#1489;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, cushions, pillows, stragulae. Bttcher punctuates &#1502;&#1512;&#1489;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; incorrectly; the &#1489; remains aspirated, and the connection of the syllables is looser than in &#1502;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492;, Ewald, 88d. The &#1510;&#1496;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; beginning the second half-verse is in no case an adjective to &#1502;&#1512;&#1489;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;, in every case only appos., probably an independent conception; not derived from &#1495;&#1496;&#1489; (cogn. &#1495;&#1510;&#1489;), to hew wood (whence Arab. h&#803;at&#803;ab, fire-wood), according to which Kimchi, and with him the Graec. Venet. (&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3be;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;), understands it of the carefully polished bed-poles or bed-boards, but from &#1495;&#1496;&#1489;  equals  Arab. khat&#803;eba, to be streaked, of diverse colours (vid., under <a href="/psalms/144-12.htm">Psalm 144:12</a>), whence the Syriac macht&#803;abto, a figured (striped, checkered) garment. Hitzig finds the idea of coloured or variegated here unsuitable, but without justice; for the pleasantness of a bed is augmented not only by its softness, but also by the impression which its costliness makes on the eye. The following &#1488;&#1496;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503; &#1502;&#1510;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; stands in an appositional relation to &#1495;&#1496;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;, as when one says in Arabic taub-un d&#305;&#770;ba&#770;g'-un, a garment brocade  equals  of brocade. &#1488;&#1496;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503; (after the Syr. for &#1488;&#1496;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;, as &#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;) signifies in the Targum the cord (e.g., <a href="/jeremiah/38-6.htm">Jeremiah 38:6</a>), like the Arab. t&#803;unub, Syr. (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/54-2.htm">Isaiah 54:2</a>) tu&#770;nob; the root is &#1496;&#1503;, not in the sense of to bind, to wind (Deitr.), but in the sense of to stretch; the thread or cord is named from the extension in regard to length, and &#1488;&#1496;&#1493;&#1503; is thus thread-work, whether in weaving or spinning.<p>(Note: Hence perhaps the Greek &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;, which Fick in his Vergl. Wrterbuch connects with the Arab. verb-root vadh, to bind, wind, clothe, but not without making thereto interrogation marks.)<p>The fame of Egyptian manufactures is still expressed in the Spanish aclabtea, fine linen cloth, which is equivalent to the modern Arabic el-k&#803;obt&#803;&#305;&#770;je (k&#803;ibt&#803;ije); they had there particularly also an intimate acquaintance with the dye stuffs found in the plants and fossils of the country (Klemm's Culturgeschichte, v. 308-310).</body></html>
