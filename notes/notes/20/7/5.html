Those that blame strict and careful walking as needless and too precise, consider not that the law is to be kept as the apple of the eye; indeed the law in the heart is the eye of the soul. Let the word of God dwell in us, and so be written where it will be always at hand to be read. Thus we shall be kept from the fatal effects of our own passions, and the snares of Satan.

When the heart is filled with the love of what is good, it is armed against the seductions of evil pleasure or whatever may entice the soul from God and duty.

Jealousy is not usually &#1495;&#1502;&#1492;, the glow of anger (from &#1497;&#1495;&#1501;, as &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492; from &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1503;), but &#1495;&#1502;&#1514;&#1470;&#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; (constr. as &#1513;&#1474;&#1504;&#1514;), the glow of a man's anger, who with the putting forth of all his manly strength will seek satisfaction to his wounded honour. &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;, here significant for &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, with the fundamental idea of strength, firmness; cf. Arab. jabr, to make fast, to put right again something broken in pieces, particularly a broken vessel, hence Algebra, properly the operation by which an incomplete magnitude is completed (Fl.). The following &#1493;&#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1497;&#1495;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500; (with the orthophonic Dagesh, as <a href="/proverbs/6-25.htm">Proverbs 6:25</a> &#1497;&#1495;&#1502;&#1468;&#1491;, and with Makkeph) is connected with &#1490;&#1489;&#1512;, with definite reference to the man whom the faithless guest has made a cuckold. When the day comes in which the adultery brought to light demands and admits of vengeance, then, wounded in his right and in his honour, he knows no mercy; he pays no regard to any atonement or recompense by which the adulterer seeks to appease him and induce him not to inflict the punishment that is due: he does not consent, even though thou makest ever so great the gift whereby thou thinkest to gain him.
