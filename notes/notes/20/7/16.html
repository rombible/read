It is a history or a parable of the most instructive kind. Will any one dare to venture on temptations that lead to impurity, after Solomon has set before his eyes in so lively and plain a manner, the danger of even going near them? Then is he as the man who would dance on the edge of a lofty rock, when he has just seen another fall headlong from the same place. The misery of self-ruined sinners began in disregard to God's blessed commands. We ought daily to pray that we may be kept from running into temptation, else we invite the enemies of our souls to spread snares for us. Ever avoid the neighbourhood of vice. Beware of sins which are said to be pleasant sins. They are the more dangerous, because they most easily gain the heart, and close it against repentance. Do nothing till thou hast well considered the end of it. Were a man to live as long as Methuselah, and to spend all his days in the highest delights sin can offer, one hour of the anguish and tribulation that must follow, would far outweigh them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The words point to the art and commerce which flourished under Solomon.<p>Carved works - Most commentators take the original as meaning "striped coverlets of linen of Egypt." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16, 17. my bed&#8212;or, "couch," adorned in the costliest manner.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/proverbs/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> She designs to inflame his lust by the mention of the bed, and by its ornaments and perfumes. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/proverbs/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry,.... Made use of by the ancients (o) for bed clothes: beautiful ornaments, as Gersom; and precious garments, as Jarchi. She had adorned her bed with curtains and clothes, very delightful to the eye, and inviting; and had well corded it, as some interpret it, with cords of fine linen, and all to allure her lovers; she soon discovered her lustful inclinations, what her heart was upon, and says this, and more, to fire the young man's lust, and cause him to follow her: so the church of Rome adorns her places of worship in the most pompous manner; which are the beds in which she commits adultery, <a href="/revelation/2-22.htm">Revelation 2:22</a>; and also her images to strike the minds of people, and draw them into her idolatrous worship; <p>with carved works; perhaps the bed's head, tester, and posts, were all carved, and cut out of cedar wood and others, as Gersom observes; though some think: this refers to the variety of work in tapestry, which look like incisions and carvings, or the network, and agnet holes made therein: this may be very well applied to the carved work, and carved images, set up in the Romish churches; <p>with fine linen of Egypt; the sheets, pillows, and bolsters, made thereof, and so soft to lie upon; which was reckoned the best and finest, though not the strongest. Pliny says (p), of the linen of Egypt, that it had less strength and firmness in it (it being so fine); but bore the best price, and was the most gainful and profitable. The word used is not what is elsewhere met with, even when the linen of Egypt is mentioned, and indeed is nowhere else used: the Targum renders it, an Egyptian covering; and so most of the Oriental versions interpret it of bed coverings of tapestry painted, brought out of Egypt. The word is used in the Chaldee language for cords; and may here signify threads of linen twisted together, or linen cords, with which the harlot's bed was corded, and looked beautiful. Pliny (q) says, there were four sorts of linen in Egypt; Tanitic, Pelusiac, Butic, and Tenterytic; so called from the names and provinces where they were cultivated; and perhaps the Etun of Egypt may be the Tanitic: the fine linen, called "byssus", was brought out of India into Egypt; and is said to grow upon a tree as high as the poplar, and its leaves like a willow (r). Egypt is very properly made mention of in this account; it being one of the names of the city of Rome, of the great city, which is spiritually called Sodom and Egypt, and equal to both for lust and luxury, <a href="/revelation/11-8.htm">Revelation 11:8</a>. <p>(o) Vid.

The expression occurs again in <a href="/proverbs/31-22.htm">Proverbs 31:22</a>. It is derived from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span> "to spread," and means cushions spread out ready for use. The Septuagint has <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">funibus</span>, "cords." These versions seem to regard the word as denoting a kind of delicate sacking on which the coverlets were laid. <span class="cmt_word">Carved works, with fine linen of Egypt;</span> literally, <span class="accented">striped, or variegated, coverings, Egyptian linen.</span> The words are in  apposition, but the latter point to the material used, which is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5d8;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5df;</span>, <span class="accented">etun</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>), "linen yarn or thread," hence equivalent to "coverlets of Egyptian thread." This was of extreme fineness, costly, and much prized. By "carved works" (Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5d8;&#x5bb;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> <span class="accented">chatuboth</span>) the Authorized Version must refer to bed poles or bed boards elaborately carved and polished; but the word is better taken of coverlets striped in different colours, which give the idea of richness and luxury.

The mention of these articles denotes the foreign commerce of the Hebrews, and their appreciation of artistic work (comp. <a href="/isaiah/19-9.htm">Isaiah 19:9</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/27-7.htm">Ezekiel 27:7</a>).

But she who is spoken of is not such an one; lurking is not applicable to her (cf. <a href="/job/31-9.htm">Job 31:9</a>), and, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/7-11.htm">Proverbs 7:11</a>, it is not meant that she is thus inclined." But Hitzig's rendering of <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/7-11.htm">Proverbs 7:11</a>, "she was boisterous ... in her house her feet had no rest," is inaccurate, since neither &#1492;&#1497;&#1488;&#1493; nor &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; is used. Thus in <a href="/proverbs/7-11.htm">Proverbs 7:11</a> and <a href="/proverbs/7-12.htm">Proverbs 7:12</a> the poet gives a characteristic of the woman, introduced by &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493; into the frame of his picture, which goes beyond that which then presented itself to his eyes. We must with <a href="/proverbs/7-12.htm">Proverbs 7:12</a> reject also <a href="/proverbs/7-11.htm">Proverbs 7:11</a>; and even that would not be a radical improvement, since that characteristic lying behind the evident, that which was then evident begins with &#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1510;&#1512;&#1514; &#1500;&#1489; (and subtle in heart). We must thus suppose that the woman was not unknown to the observer here describing her. He describes her first as she then appeared. &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514; Hitzig regards as equivalent to &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1497;&#1514;, similitude (from &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1492;), and why? Because &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514; does not mean "to lay against," but "to place." But <a href="/exodus/33-4.htm">Exodus 33:4</a> shows the contrary, and justifies the meaning attire, which the word also has in <a href="/psalms/73-6.htm">Psalm 73:6</a>. Meri less suitably compares <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/9-30.htm">2 Kings 9:30</a>, but rightly explains &#1514;&#1511;&#1493;&#1503; (dressing, ornament), and remarks that &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514; elliptical is equivalent to &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514;. It is not the nominative (Bertheau), but the accusative, as &#1514;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/144-12.htm">Psalm 144:12</a>, Ewald, 279d. How Hitzig reaches the translation of &#1493;&#1504;&#1510;&#1512;&#1514; &#1500;&#1489; by "and an arrow in her heart" (et saucia corde)<p>(Note: Virgil's Aeneid, iv. 1.)<p>one can only understand by reading his commentary. The usage of the language, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/4-23.htm">Proverbs 4:23</a>, he remarks, among other things, would stamp her as a virtuous person. As if a phrase like &#1504;&#1510;&#1512; &#1500;&#1489; could be used both sensu bono and sensu malo! One can guard his heart when he protects it carefully against moral danger, or also when he purposely conceals that which is in it. The part. &#1504;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; signifies, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/1-8.htm">Isaiah 1:8</a>, besieged (blockaded), <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-12.htm">Ezekiel 16:12</a>, protected, guarded, and <a href="/isaiah/48-6.htm">Isaiah 48:6</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/65-4.htm">Isaiah 65:4</a>, concealed, hidden. Ewald, 187b, refers these three significations in the two passages in Isaiah and in the passage before us to &#1510;&#1512;&#1512;, Niph. &#1504;&#1510;&#1512; (as &#1504;&#1490;&#1500;); but (1) one would then more surely take &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; (cf. &#1504;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1500;, &#1504;&#1489;&#1499;&#1497;&#1501;) as the verbal stem; (2) one reaches the idea of the concealed (the hidden) easier from that of the preserved than from that of the confined. As one says in Lat. homo occultus, tectus, abstrusus, in the sense of &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c8;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;, so it is said of that woman &#1504;&#1510;&#1512;&#1514; &#1500;&#1489;, not so much in the sense of retenta cor, h.e. quae quod in corde haberet non pandebat, Fr. retenue (Cocc.), as in the sense of custodita cor, quae intentionem cordis mentemque suam callide novit premere (Mich.): she is of a hidden mind, of a concealed nature; for she feigns fidelity to her husband and flatters her paramours as her only beloved, while in truth she loves none, and each of them is to her only a means to an end, viz., to the indulgence of her worldly sensual desire. For, as the author further describes here, she is &#1492;&#1502;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; (fem. of &#1492;&#1502;&#1492;  equals  &#1492;&#1502;&#1497;, as <a href="/proverbs/1-21.htm">Proverbs 1:21</a>; <a href="/isaiah/22-2.htm">Isaiah 22:2</a>), tumultuosa, externally as internally impetuous, because full of intermingling lust and deceit (opp. &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, <a href="/1_peter/3-4.htm">1 Peter 3:4</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/2-11.htm">1 Timothy 2:11</a>), and &#1505;&#1512;&#1512;&#1514;, self-willed, not minding the law of duty, of discretion, or of modesty (from &#1505;&#1512;&#1512;, Arab. sharr, pervicacem, malum esse).
