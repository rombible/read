The peace-, or thank-offering as it is also rendered, was purely voluntary, in token of thanksgiving for some mercy. The breast and right shoulder of the victim were given to the priest, and the rest belonged to the offerer, who was thus admitted, as it were, to feast with God (Leviticus 3, 7), profanation of this privilege being punished with death. Peace-offerings were accordingly offered on occasions of national rejoicing, as at the inauguration of the covenant (<a href="/exodus/24-5.htm" title="And he sent young men of the children of Israel, which offered burnt offerings, and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen to the LORD.">Exodus 24:5</a>), at the accession of Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/11-15.htm" title="And all the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king before the LORD in Gilgal; and there they sacrificed sacrifices of peace offerings before the LORD; and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.">1Samuel 11:15</a>), and at the bringing up of the ark to Zion (<a href="/2_samuel/6-17.htm" title="And they brought in the ark of the LORD, and set it in his place, in the middle of the tabernacle that David had pitched for it: and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.">2Samuel 6:17</a>), &c. This turning of what should have been a religious festival for the family into an occasion for license, is paralleled by the desecration of the Agapæ at Corinth (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-20.htm" title="When you come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lord's supper.">1Corinthians 11:20</a> <span class= "ital">sqq.</span>) and the history of Church-feasts among ourselves. (For the spiritual interpretation of this passage as symbolising false doctrine, see Bishop Wordsworth; and also Notes on <a href="/context/proverbs/2-16.htm" title="To deliver you from the strange woman, even from the stranger which flatters with her words;">Proverbs 2:16-19</a> above.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/proverbs/7.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/proverbs/7-14.htm" title="I have peace offerings with me; this day have I paid my vows.">Proverbs 7:14</a></span>. <span class="ital">I have peace-offerings with me — </span>“I am a woman happy in many blessings, which God hath bestowed upon me, and for which I have given him solemn thanks this very day; and, as religion and custom bind me, I have provided as good a feast as those sacrifices, which I formerly vowed, and have now paid, would afford, having no want of any thing, but of some good company at home to rejoice with me.” This woman’s conduct was the more abominable, as she covered her lewdness with the mask of piety and devotion. There were three sorts of peace-offerings, as appears by <a href="/context/leviticus/7-11.htm" title="And this is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which he shall offer to the LORD....">Leviticus 7:11-16</a>; and Bishop Patrick is of opinion that those here mentioned were offerings of thanksgiving for blessings already obtained, and not of prayer for blessings not yet received, because the woman was so solicitous to have company at her feast upon this very day. It is well known that such sacrifices were to be of the best, either of bullocks, or sheep, or goats, (<a href="/leviticus/3-1.htm" title="And if his oblation be a sacrifice of peace offering, if he offer it of the herd; whether it be a male or female, he shall offer it without blemish before the LORD.">Leviticus 3:1</a>; <a href="/leviticus/3-6.htm" title="And if his offering for a sacrifice of peace offering to the LORD be of the flock; male or female, he shall offer it without blemish.">Leviticus 3:6</a>; <a href="/leviticus/3-12.htm" title="And if his offering be a goat, then he shall offer it before the LORD.">Leviticus 3:12</a>,) and that the greatest part of them fell to the share of the person who offered them that he might feast with God. “It will not appear wonderful,” says Mr. Scott, “that these sacred ordinances should give occasion to carnal feasts attended with every vice, when we reflect how all kinds of sensuality are indulged in,” among professing Christians in our day, “under pretence of commemorating the nativity of Christ, who was <span class="ital">manifested to destroy the works of the devil.”</span><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:6-27 Here is an affecting example of the danger of youthful lusts. It is a history or a parable of the most instructive kind. Will any one dare to venture on temptations that lead to impurity, after Solomon has set before his eyes in so lively and plain a manner, the danger of even going near them? Then is he as the man who would dance on the edge of a lofty rock, when he has just seen another fall headlong from the same place. The misery of self-ruined sinners began in disregard to God's blessed commands. We ought daily to pray that we may be kept from running into temptation, else we invite the enemies of our souls to spread snares for us. Ever avoid the neighbourhood of vice. Beware of sins which are said to be pleasant sins. They are the more dangerous, because they most easily gain the heart, and close it against repentance. Do nothing till thou hast well considered the end of it. Were a man to live as long as Methuselah, and to spend all his days in the highest delights sin can offer, one hour of the anguish and tribulation that must follow, would far outweigh them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This pretence of a religious feast gives us an insight into some strange features of popular religion under the monarchy of Judah. The harlot uses the technical word <a href="/leviticus/3-1.htm">Leviticus 3:1</a> for the "peace-offerings," and makes them the starting-point for her sin. They have to be eaten on the same day that they are offered <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/7-15.htm">Leviticus 7:15-16</a>, and she invites her victim to the feast. She who speaks is a "foreigner" who, under a show of conformity to the religion of Israel, still retains her old notions (see <a href="/proverbs/2-16.htm">Proverbs 2:16</a> note), and a feast-day to her is nothing but a time of self-indulgence, which she may invite another to share with her. If we assume, as probable, that these harlots of Jerusalem were mainly of Phoenician origin, the connection of their worship with their sin would be but the continuation of their original "cultus." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13-15.

Meaning at her house. These peace offerings were of the eucharistic kind; they were offered by way of thanksgiving for favours received; the greatest part of which, all excepting the fat on the kidneys, the rump of the sheep, the breast and right shoulder, which were the priest's, were returned to the offerers to feast upon with their friends, and were to be eaten the same day, <a href="/leviticus/7-11.htm">Leviticus 7:11</a>. This she said to show that she was no common strumpet, or that prostituted herself for gain; that she was a sufficient housewife, had a considerable affluence of life, her substance greatly increased, for which she had made her thank offering that day; that she wanted nothing of him but his company, and the enjoyment of him; and that she had good cheer to regale him with. She was properly  "a holy" religious harlot, as the word sometimes signifies; and such is the church of Rome, which makes great pretensions to devotion and religion, yet is the mother of harlots, and abominations of the earth, <a href="/revelation/17-5.htm">Revelation 17:5</a>; <p>this day have I paid my vows; not on account of the young man, and for his health, and for meeting with him; for those vows were not now made to be paid, but were made and paid already: but her vows of peace offerings and thanksgivings, which, as she had promised, she had performed.

The religious nature of the feast is utterly ignored or forgotten. The shameless woman uses the opportunity simply as a convenience for her sin. If, as is probable, the "strange woman" is a foreigner, she is one who only outwardly conforms to the Mosaic Law, but in her heart cleaves to the impure worship of her heathen hems And doubtless, in lax times, these religious festivals, even in the case of worshippers who were not influenced by idolatrous proclivities, degenerated into self-indulgence and excess. The early Christian agapae were thus misused (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-20.htm">1 Corinthians 11:20</a>, etc.); and in modern times religious anniversaries have too often become occasions of licence and debauchery, their solemn origin and pious uses being entirely thrust aside. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Now follows, whither he saw the young fop [Laffen] then go in the darkness.<p>8 Going up and down the street near her corner,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; And he walked along the way to her house,<p>9 In the twilight, when the day declined,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; In the midst of the night and deep darkness.<p>We may interpret &#1506;&#1489;&#1512; as appos.: juvenem amentem, ambulantem, or as the predicate accus.: vidi juvenem ... ambulantem; for that one may so express himself in Hebrew (cf. e.g., <a href="/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1</a>; <a href="/daniel/8-7.htm">Daniel 8:7</a>), Hitzig unwarrantably denies.
