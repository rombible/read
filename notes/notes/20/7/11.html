It is a history or a parable of the most instructive kind. Will any one dare to venture on temptations that lead to impurity, after Solomon has set before his eyes in so lively and plain a manner, the danger of even going near them? Then is he as the man who would dance on the edge of a lofty rock, when he has just seen another fall headlong from the same place. The misery of self-ruined sinners began in disregard to God's blessed commands. We ought daily to pray that we may be kept from running into temptation, else we invite the enemies of our souls to spread snares for us. Ever avoid the neighbourhood of vice. Beware of sins which are said to be pleasant sins. They are the more dangerous, because they most easily gain the heart, and close it against repentance. Do nothing till thou hast well considered the end of it. Were a man to live as long as Methuselah, and to spend all his days in the highest delights sin can offer, one hour of the anguish and tribulation that must follow, would far outweigh them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Loud and stubborn - Both words describe the half-animal signs of a vicious nature.

If in Arabic the poor is called the brother of poverty, the trustworthy the brother of trustworthiness, and abu, um (&#1488;&#1501;), achu, ucht, are used in manifold ways as the expression for the interchangeable relation between two ideas; so (as also, notwithstanding Ewald, 273b, in many Hebr. proper names) that has there become national, which here, as at <a href="/job/17-14.htm">Job 17:14</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/30-29.htm">Job 30:29</a>, mediated by the connection of the thoughts, only first appears as a poetic venture. The figurative words of <a href="/proverbs/7-4.htm">Proverbs 7:4</a> not merely lead us to think of wisdom as a personal existence of a higher order, but by this representation it is itself brought so near, that &#1488;&#1501; easily substitutes itself, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/2-3.htm">Proverbs 2:3</a>, in the place of &#1488;&#1501;. &#1488;&#1495;&#1514;&#1497; of Solomon's address to the bride brought home is in its connection compared with Book of Wisdom 8:2. While the o&#770;th of &#1488;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; by no means arises from abstr. u&#770;th, but acho&#770;th is derived from achajath, &#1502;&#1493;&#1491;&#1506; (as <a href="//biblehub.com/ruth/2-1.htm">Ruth 2:1</a>, cf. &#1502;&#1493;&#1491;&#1506;&#1514;, <a href="/proverbs/3-2.htm">Proverbs 3:2</a>), here by Mugrash &#1502;&#1493;&#1491;&#1506;, properly means acquaintance, and then the person known, but not in the superficial sense in which this word and the Arab. ma'arfat are used (e.g., in the Arabic phrase quoted by Fleischer, kanna as&#803;h&#803;aab s&#803;arna m'aaraf - nous tions amis, nous en sommes plus que de simples connaissances), but in the sense of familiar, confidential alliance. The infin. &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1498; does not need for its explanation some intermediate thought to be introduced: quod eo conducet tibi ut (Mich.), but connects itself immediately as the purpose: bind wisdom to thyself and thyself to wisdom thus closely that thou mayest therewith guard thyself. As for the rest, vid., <a href="/proverbs/2-16.htm">Proverbs 2:16</a>; this verse repeats itself here with the variation of one word. </body></html>
