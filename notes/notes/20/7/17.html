It is a history or a parable of the most instructive kind. Will any one dare to venture on temptations that lead to impurity, after Solomon has set before his eyes in so lively and plain a manner, the danger of even going near them? Then is he as the man who would dance on the edge of a lofty rock, when he has just seen another fall headlong from the same place. The misery of self-ruined sinners began in disregard to God's blessed commands. We ought daily to pray that we may be kept from running into temptation, else we invite the enemies of our souls to spread snares for us. Ever avoid the neighbourhood of vice. Beware of sins which are said to be pleasant sins. They are the more dangerous, because they most easily gain the heart, and close it against repentance. Do nothing till thou hast well considered the end of it. Were a man to live as long as Methuselah, and to spend all his days in the highest delights sin can offer, one hour of the anguish and tribulation that must follow, would far outweigh them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The love of perfumes is here, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/3-24.htm">Isaiah 3:24</a>, a sign of luxurious vice.<p>Cinnamon - The Hebrew word is identical with the English.

The love of such things is reckoned as a sign of luxury and vice (<a href="/isaiah/3-20.htm">Isaiah 3:20</a>, etc.). The three perfumes are mentioned together in <a href="/songs/4-14.htm">Song of Solomon 4:14</a>; "myrrh, aloes, and cassia," in <a href="/psalms/45-8.htm">Psalm 45:8</a>. Septuagint, "I have sprinkled my couch with saffron, and my house with cinnamon." Myrrh is nowadays imported chiefly from Bombay, but it seems to be found in Arabia and on the coasts of the Red Sea and Persian Gulf. It is a gummy substance exuding from the bark of the balsamodendron when wounded, and possessing an aromatic odour not particularly agreeable to modern tastes. It was one of the ingredients of the holy oil (<a href="/exodus/30-28.htm">Exodus 30:28</a>), and was used in the purification of women (<a href="/esther/2-12.htm">Esther 2:12</a>), as well as in perfuming persons and things, and, mixed with aloes, in embalming dead bodies (<a href="/john/19-39.htm">John 19:39</a>). Aloes is the inspissated juice of the leaves of the aloe, a leguminous plant growing in India, Cochin China, Abyssinia, and Socotra. The ancients used the dried root for aromatic purposes. It is mentioned by Balaam (<a href="/numbers/24-6.htm">Numbers 24:6</a>). Cinnamon, which is the same word in Hebrew and Greek, is the fragrant bark of a tree growing in Ceylon and India and the east coast of <span class="accented">Africa.</span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Finally, the young man devoid of understanding sees his waiting rewarded: like meets like.<p>10 And, lo, a woman coming to meet him,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the attire of an harlot and of subtle heart.<p>11 Boisterous is she, and ungovernable;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her feet have no rest in her own house.<p>12 At one time before her door, at another in the street,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And again at every corner she places herself on the watch.<p>"Pro 7:12 (Hitzig) expresses what is wont to be, instead of a single event, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/7-11.htm">Proverbs 7:11</a>, viz., the custom of a street harlot. But she who is spoken of is not such an one; lurking is not applicable to her (cf. <a href="/job/31-9.htm">Job 31:9</a>), and, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/7-11.htm">Proverbs 7:11</a>, it is not meant that she is thus inclined." But Hitzig's rendering of <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/7-11.htm">Proverbs 7:11</a>, "she was boisterous ... in her house her feet had no rest," is inaccurate, since neither &#1492;&#1497;&#1488;&#1493; nor &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; is used. Thus in <a href="/proverbs/7-11.htm">Proverbs 7:11</a> and <a href="/proverbs/7-12.htm">Proverbs 7:12</a> the poet gives a characteristic of the woman, introduced by &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493; into the frame of his picture, which goes beyond that which then presented itself to his eyes. We must with <a href="/proverbs/7-12.htm">Proverbs 7:12</a> reject also <a href="/proverbs/7-11.htm">Proverbs 7:11</a>; and even that would not be a radical improvement, since that characteristic lying behind the evident, that which was then evident begins with &#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1510;&#1512;&#1514; &#1500;&#1489; (and subtle in heart). We must thus suppose that the woman was not unknown to the observer here describing her. He describes her first as she then appeared. &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514; Hitzig regards as equivalent to &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1497;&#1514;, similitude (from &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1492;), and why? Because &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514; does not mean "to lay against," but "to place." But <a href="/exodus/33-4.htm">Exodus 33:4</a> shows the contrary, and justifies the meaning attire, which the word also has in <a href="/psalms/73-6.htm">Psalm 73:6</a>. Meri less suitably compares <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/9-30.htm">2 Kings 9:30</a>, but rightly explains &#1514;&#1511;&#1493;&#1503; (dressing, ornament), and remarks that &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514; elliptical is equivalent to &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514;. It is not the nominative (Bertheau), but the accusative, as &#1514;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/144-12.htm">Psalm 144:12</a>, Ewald, 279d. How Hitzig reaches the translation of &#1493;&#1504;&#1510;&#1512;&#1514; &#1500;&#1489; by "and an arrow in her heart" (et saucia corde)<p>(Note: Virgil's Aeneid, iv. 1.)<p>one can only understand by reading his commentary. The usage of the language, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/4-23.htm">Proverbs 4:23</a>, he remarks, among other things, would stamp her as a virtuous person. As if a phrase like &#1504;&#1510;&#1512; &#1500;&#1489; could be used both sensu bono and sensu malo! One can guard his heart when he protects it carefully against moral danger, or also when he purposely conceals that which is in it. The part. &#1504;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; signifies, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/1-8.htm">Isaiah 1:8</a>, besieged (blockaded), <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-12.htm">Ezekiel 16:12</a>, protected, guarded, and <a href="/isaiah/48-6.htm">Isaiah 48:6</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/65-4.htm">Isaiah 65:4</a>, concealed, hidden. Ewald, 187b, refers these three significations in the two passages in Isaiah and in the passage before us to &#1510;&#1512;&#1512;, Niph. &#1504;&#1510;&#1512; (as &#1504;&#1490;&#1500;); but (1) one would then more surely take &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; (cf. &#1504;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1500;, &#1504;&#1489;&#1499;&#1497;&#1501;) as the verbal stem; (2) one reaches the idea of the concealed (the hidden) easier from that of the preserved than from that of the confined. As one says in Lat. homo occultus, tectus, abstrusus, in the sense of &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c8;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;, so it is said of that woman &#1504;&#1510;&#1512;&#1514; &#1500;&#1489;, not so much in the sense of retenta cor, h.e. quae quod in corde haberet non pandebat, Fr. retenue (Cocc.), as in the sense of custodita cor, quae intentionem cordis mentemque suam callide novit premere (Mich.): she is of a hidden mind, of a concealed nature; for she feigns fidelity to her husband and flatters her paramours as her only beloved, while in truth she loves none, and each of them is to her only a means to an end, viz., to the indulgence of her worldly sensual desire. For, as the author further describes here, she is &#1492;&#1502;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; (fem. of &#1492;&#1502;&#1492;  equals  &#1492;&#1502;&#1497;, as <a href="/proverbs/1-21.htm">Proverbs 1:21</a>; <a href="/isaiah/22-2.htm">Isaiah 22:2</a>), tumultuosa, externally as internally impetuous, because full of intermingling lust and deceit (opp. &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, <a href="/1_peter/3-4.htm">1 Peter 3:4</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/2-11.htm">1 Timothy 2:11</a>), and &#1505;&#1512;&#1512;&#1514;, self-willed, not minding the law of duty, of discretion, or of modesty (from &#1505;&#1512;&#1512;, Arab. sharr, pervicacem, malum esse). She is the very opposite of the noiseless activity and the gentle modesty of a true house-wife, rude, stubborn, and also vagrant like a beast in its season (<a href="/hosea/4-14.htm">Hosea 4:14</a>): in domo ipsius residere nequeunt pedes ejus; thus not &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; or &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; (<a href="/titus/2-5.htm">Titus 2:5</a>), far removed from the genuine woman - like &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c9; &#x3b7;&#788;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;<p>(Note: Eurip.
