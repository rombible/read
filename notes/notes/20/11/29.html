Even the righteous, when they offend on earth, shall meet with sharp corrections; much more will the wicked meet the due reward of their sins.

So the Son of Sirach writes (Ecclus. 4:30), "Be not as a lion in thy house, nor frantic (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, 'suspicious') among thy servants."

It is implied that the troubler of his own house shall be reduced to such extremity as to have to apply for relief to the wise of heart. The other side of the question is given by the Son of Sirach: "Unto the servant that is wise shall they that are free do service" (Ecclus. 10:25). The prodigal in the parable prayed his father to make him one of his hired servants (<a href="/luke/15-19.htm">Luke 15:19</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>23 The desire of the righteous is nothing but good,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The expectation of the godless is presumption.<p>This is usually explained with Fleischer: If the righteous wish for anything, their wish reaches to no other than a fortunate issue; but if the godless hope for anything, then there is to them in the end as their portion, not the good they hoped for, but wrath (<a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/10-28.htm">Proverbs 10:28</a>, cf. <a href="/proverbs/11-4.htm">Proverbs 11:4</a>). However, that &#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1492; is at once to be understood thus, as in &#1497;&#1493;&#1501; &#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1492;, and that the phrase is to be rendered: the hope of the godless is God's wrath, is doubtful. But &#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1492; denotes also want of moderation, and particularly in the form of presumption, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/21-24.htm">Proverbs 21:24</a>, <a href="/isaiah/16-6.htm">Isaiah 16:6</a>; and thus we gain the thought that the desire of the righteous is directed only to that which is good, and thus to an object that is attainable because well-pleasing to God, while on the contrary the hope of the godless consists only in the suggestions of their presumption, and thus is vain self-deceit. The punctuation &#1514;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; &#1510;&#1491;&#1497;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501; is contrary to rule; correct texts have &#1514;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; &#1510;&#1491;&#1497;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501;, for Dech stands before Athnach only if the Athnach-word has two syllables (Torath Emeth, p. 43; Accentssystem, xviii. 4). </body></html>
