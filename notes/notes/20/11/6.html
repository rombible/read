Considering how safe, and quiet, and easy the humble are, we see that with the lowly is wisdom. 3. An honest man's principles are fixed, therefore his way is plain. 4. Riches will stand men in no stead in the day of death. 5,6. The ways of wickedness are dangerous. And sin will be its own punishment. 7. When a godly man dies, all his fears vanish; but when a wicked man dies, his hopes vanish. 8. The righteous are often wonderfully kept from going into dangerous situations, and the ungodly go in their stead. 9. Hypocrites delude men into error and sin by artful objections against the truths of God's word. 10,11. Nations prosper when wicked men are cast down. 12. A man of understanding does not judge of others by their success. 13. A faithful man will not disclose what he is trusted with, unless the honour of God and the real good of society require it. 14. We shall often find it to our advantage to advise with others. 15. The welfare of our families, our own peace, and our ability to pay just debts, must not be brought into danger. But here especially let us consider the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ in becoming Surety even for enemies. 16. A pious and discreet woman will keep esteem and respect, as strong men keep possession of wealth. 17. A cruel, froward, ill-natured man, is vexatious to those that are, and should be to him as his own flesh, and punishes himself. 18. He that makes it his business to do good, shall have a reward, as sure to him as eternal truth can make it. 19. True holiness is true happiness. The more violent a man is in sinful pursuits, the more he hastens his own destruction. 20. Nothing is more hateful to God, than hypocrisy and double dealing, which are here signified. God delights in such as aim and act with uprightness. 21. Joining together in sin shall not protect the sinners. 22. Beauty is abused by those who have not discretion or modesty with it. This is true of all bodily endowments. 23. The wicked desire mischief to others, but it shall return upon themselves. 24. A man may grow poor by not paying just debts, not relieving the poor, not allowing needful expenses. Let men be ever so saving of what they have, if God appoints, it comes to nothing. 25. Both in temporal and spiritual things, God commonly deals with his people according to the measure by which they deal with their brethren. 26. We must not hoard up the gifts of God's bounty, merely for our own advantage. 27. Seeking mischief is here set against seeking good; for those that are not doing good are doing hurt, even to themselves.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The day of wrath - Words true in their highest sense of the great "diesirae" of the future, but spoken in the first instance (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-15.htm">Zephaniah 1:15-18</a>) of any "day of the Lord," any time of judgment, when men or nations receive the chastisement of their sins.

Venet., which translates &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;, makes use of a MS which it sometimes misreads. The text does not stand in need of any emendations, but rather of a corrected relation between the clauses, for the relation of 31a with 32b, and of 32a with 31b, strongly commends itself (Hitzig); in that case the explanation lies near: the lips of the righteous find what is acceptable, viz., to God. But this thought in the Mashal language is otherwise expressed (<a href="/proverbs/12-2.htm">Proverbs 12:2</a> and paral.); and also 32a and 32b fit each other as contrasts, if by &#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1503;, as <a href="/proverbs/11-27.htm">Proverbs 11:27</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/14-9.htm">Proverbs 14:9</a>, is to be understood that which is acceptable in its widest generality, equally then in relation to God and man. It is a question whether &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1493;&#1503; means that they have knowledge of it (as one e.g., says &#1497;&#1491;&#1506; &#1505;&#1508;&#1512;, to understand writing, i.e., the reading of it), or that they think thereupon (cf. <a href="/proverbs/27-23.htm">Proverbs 27:23</a>). Fundamentally the two ideas, according to the Hebrew conception of the words, lie in each other; for the central conception, perceiving, is biblically equivalent to a delighted searching into or going towards the object. Thus: the lips of the righteous think of that which is acceptable (&#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1503;, cogn. to &#1495;&#1503;, gracefulness; &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, <a href="/colossians/4-6.htm">Colossians 4:6</a>); while the mouth of the godless is mere falsehood, which God (the wisdom of God) hates, and from which discord on all sides arises. We might transfer &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1493;&#1503; to 32b; but this line, interpreted as a clause by itself, is stronger and more pointed (Fl.). </body></html>
