Which Aben Ezra understands of the recompence of their good works. There is a reward for the righteous, and which they have now in keeping, though not "for" keeping, the commandments of God; they have the promise of this life, as well as of that which is to come, and which is made good to them; they have every good thing now which is proper and convenient for them; and they shall be recompensed in the new earth, in which only righteous persons will dwell. But it seems better, with Jarchi, to interpret it of the recompence of their sins and transgressions; that is, of their chastisements and afflictions, with which they are chastised by their heavenly Father, when they sin against him; which are all in love and for their good; and which they have only here on earth, while they are in this world; they will be all over in another, when there will be no more sin, and no more chastisement for it, much less condemnation; see <a href="/1_corinthians/11-32.htm">1 Corinthians 11:32</a>; <p>much more the wicked and the sinner; who shall not only be punished on earth as they often are, but in hell to all eternity. The Septuagint, Syriac, and Arabic versions, render the whole thus; "if the righteous be scarcely saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?" Which words are used by the Apostle Peter, to show, that if judgment or chastisement begin at the house of God, or with the righteous, that the end of the wicked must be very bad; which entirely agrees with the sense of this passage; see <a href="/1_peter/4-17.htm">1 Peter 4:17</a>; a "behold" is prefixed to the whole, as a note, either of admiration, or rather of attention to what is sure and certain, and worthy of regard and consideration. The Targum is, <p>"behold, the righteous are strengthened in the earth; but the wicked and the sinners shall be consumed out of the earth;'' <p>which seems to agree with Aben Ezra's sense of the words; see <a href="/psalms/104-35.htm">Psalm 104:35</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/11.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Behold, the righteous shall be <span class="cverse3">{t}</span> recompensed upon the earth: much more the wicked and the sinner.</span><p>(t) Will be punished as he deserves, 1Pe 4:18.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/11.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">31</span>. <span class="ital">shall be recompensed</span>] This might mean, shall receive, in each case, the return due to him; the righteous shall be <span class="ital">rewarded</span> (as the same Heb. word is rendered in <a href="/proverbs/13-13.htm" title="Whoever despises the word shall be destroyed: but he that fears the commandment shall be rewarded.">Proverbs 13:13</a>) and the wicked <span class="ital">punished</span> (comp. <span class="ital">recompense evil</span>, the Heb. word being again the same, <a href="/jeremiah/18-20.htm" title="Shall evil be recompensed for good? for they have dig a pit for my soul. Remember that I stood before you to speak good for them, and to turn away your wrath from them.">Jeremiah 18:20</a>). But then it is difficult to understand why the law of retribution should obtain “<span class="ital">much more</span>” in the second case than in the first. “Recompensed” has therefore been understood to mean “punished” in both cases: The righteous shall be punished for his sins (“for there is no man that sinneth not,” <a href="/1_kings/8-46.htm" title="If they sin against you, (for there is no man that sins not,) and you be angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captives to the land of the enemy, far or near;">1 Kings 8:46</a>); how much more, &c. The LXX. paraphrase of this latter interpretation is adopted by St Peter: “If the righteous is scarcely saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?” <a href="/1_peter/4-18.htm" title="And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?">1 Peter 4:18</a>, R.V.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The righteous shall be recompensed in the earth.</span> Them are two ways of understanding this verse. The word rendered "recompensed," <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5b7;</span>(<span class="accented">shalam</span>), is a <span class="accented">vox media</span>, and can be taken either in a good or bad sense. So the meaning will be, "The righteous meets with his reward upon earth, much more the sinner," the "reward" of the latter being, of course, punishment. But the versions lead to another interpretation, by which "recompensed" is rendered "chastised;" and the meaning is - if even the righteous shall be punished for their trespasses, as Moses, David, etc., how much more the wicked! The Septuagint, quoted exactly by St. Peter (<a href="/1_peter/4-18.htm">1 Peter 4:18</a>) has, "If the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>25 A liberal soul [soul of blessing] is made fat,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And he that watereth others is also watered.<p>A synonymous distich (vid., p. 7). A soul of blessing is one from whom blessings go out to others, who is even a blessing to all with whom he comes into fellowship; &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1510;&#1492; denotes also particularly the gifts of love, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-27.htm">1 Samuel 25:27</a>, &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; denotes, if the Arab. is right, which derives it from the fundamental idea "to spread out:" to cause to increase and prosper by means of word and deed. The blessing which goes out from such a soul comes back again to itself: &#1514;&#1491;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1503; (as <a href="/proverbs/13-4.htm">Proverbs 13:4</a>; <a href="/proverbs/28-25.htm">Proverbs 28:25</a>), it is made fat, gains thereby sap and strength in fulness; the Pual refers to the ordinance of God; <a href="/proverbs/22-9.htm">Proverbs 22:9</a> is kindred in meaning to this anima benefica pinguefiet. In 25b &#1497;&#1493;&#1512;&#1488; is the Aramaic form of writing, but without the Aramaic vocalization (cf. <a href="/proverbs/1-10.htm">Proverbs 1:10</a>. &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1488;, <a href="/isaiah/21-12.htm">Isaiah 21:12</a> &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1514;&#1488;). Perhaps the &#1488; makes it noticeable that here a different word from &#1497;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492;, morning rain, is used; however, Symm. translates &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3b9;&#836;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;, and the Graec. Venet. (Kimchi following it) &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;. As a rule, we do not derive &#1497;&#1493;&#1512;&#1488; from &#1497;&#1512;&#1492;, of which it would be the Hophal ( equals  &#1497;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492;, as &#1492;&#1493;&#1491;&#1506;, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/4-23.htm">Leviticus 4:23</a>,  equals  &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1506;) (Ewald, 131f.); for the idea conspergitur, which the Ho. of the Hiph. &#1497;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492;, <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/6-3.htm">Hosea 6:3</a>, expresses, is, as correlate to &#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1492;, as a parallel word to &#1514;&#1491;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1503;, one not of equal force. Jerome was guided by correct feeling, for he translates: et qui inebriat ipse quoque inebriabitur. The stem-word is certainly &#1512;&#1493;&#1492;, whether it is with Hitzig to be punctuated &#1497;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;  equals  &#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1492;, or with Fleischer we are to regard &#1497;&#1493;&#1512;&#1488; as derived per metathesin from &#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1492;, as for Arab. a&#770;ra&#770;y (to cause to see) is used<p>(Note: Hitzig's comparison of rawaa&#770;, finem respicere, as transposed from waray is incorrect; the former verb, which signifies to consider, thus appears to be original.)<p>the vulgar Arab. a&#770;rway (in the Syr. Arab.) and a&#770;wray (in the Egypt. Arab.). We prefer the latter, for the passing of &#1497;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492; (from &#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1492;) into &#1497;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492; is according to rule, vid., at <a href="/proverbs/23-21.htm">Proverbs 23:21</a>. </body></html>
