Considering how safe, and quiet, and easy the humble are, we see that with the lowly is wisdom. 3. An honest man's principles are fixed, therefore his way is plain. 4. Riches will stand men in no stead in the day of death. 5,6. The ways of wickedness are dangerous. And sin will be its own punishment. 7. When a godly man dies, all his fears vanish; but when a wicked man dies, his hopes vanish. 8. The righteous are often wonderfully kept from going into dangerous situations, and the ungodly go in their stead. 9. Hypocrites delude men into error and sin by artful objections against the truths of God's word. 10,11. Nations prosper when wicked men are cast down. 12. A man of understanding does not judge of others by their success. 13. A faithful man will not disclose what he is trusted with, unless the honour of God and the real good of society require it. 14. We shall often find it to our advantage to advise with others. 15. The welfare of our families, our own peace, and our ability to pay just debts, must not be brought into danger. But here especially let us consider the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ in becoming Surety even for enemies. 16. A pious and discreet woman will keep esteem and respect, as strong men keep possession of wealth. 17. A cruel, froward, ill-natured man, is vexatious to those that are, and should be to him as his own flesh, and punishes himself. 18. He that makes it his business to do good, shall have a reward, as sure to him as eternal truth can make it. 19. True holiness is true happiness. The more violent a man is in sinful pursuits, the more he hastens his own destruction. 20. Nothing is more hateful to God, than hypocrisy and double dealing, which are here signified. God delights in such as aim and act with uprightness. 21. Joining together in sin shall not protect the sinners. 22. Beauty is abused by those who have not discretion or modesty with it. This is true of all bodily endowments. 23. The wicked desire mischief to others, but it shall return upon themselves. 24. A man may grow poor by not paying just debts, not relieving the poor, not allowing needful expenses. Let men be ever so saving of what they have, if God appoints, it comes to nothing. 25. Both in temporal and spiritual things, God commonly deals with his people according to the measure by which they deal with their brethren. 26. We must not hoard up the gifts of God's bounty, merely for our own advantage. 27. Seeking mischief is here set against seeking good; for those that are not doing good are doing hurt, even to themselves.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Through knowledge - Better, By the knowledge of the just, shall they (i. e., the neighbors) be delivered. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9.

And the contrast of &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;, integrity  equals  unreserved loving submission, is &#1505;&#1500;&#1507;, a word peculiar to the Solomonic Mashal, with its verb &#1505;&#1500;&#1468;&#1507; (vid., p. 32). Hitzig explains it by the Arab. saraf, to step out, to tread over; and Ewald by lafat, to turn, to turn about ("treacherous, false step"), both of which are improbable. Schultens compares salaf in the meaning to smear (R. &#1500;&#1507;, &#1500;&#1489;, &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;; cf. regarding such secondary formations with &#1513; preceding, Hupfeld on <a href="/psalms/5-7.htm">Psalm 5:7</a>), and translates here, lubricitas. But this rendering is scarcely admissible. It has against it lexical tradition (Menahem: &#1502;&#1493;&#1496;&#1492;, wavering; Perchon: &#1494;&#1497;&#1493;&#1507;, falsifying; Kimchi: &#1506;&#1493;&#1493;&#1514;, misrepresentation, according to which the Graec. Venet. &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;), as well as the methodical comparison of the words. The Syriac has not this verbal stem, but the Targum has &#1505;&#1500;&#1507; in the meaning to distort, to turn the wrong way (&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd;, &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd;), <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/10-10.htm">Proverbs 10:10</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/esther/6-10.htm">Esther 6:10</a>, where, in the second Targum, &#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492;&#1468; &#1488;&#1505;&#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1507; means "his mouth was crooked." With justice, therefore, Gesenius in his Thesaurus has decided in favour of the fundamental idea pervertere, from which also the Peshito and Saadia proceed; for in <a href="/exodus/23-8.htm">Exodus 23:8</a> they translate (Syr.) mhape&#770;k (it, the gift of bribery, perverts) and (Arab.) tazyf ( equals  &#1514;&#1468;&#1494;&#1497;&#1468;&#1507;, it falsifies). Fl. also, who at <a href="/proverbs/15-4.htm">Proverbs 15:4</a> remarks, "&#1505;&#1500;&#1507;, from &#1505;&#1500;&#1507;, to stir up, to turn over, so that the lowermost becomes the uppermost," gives the preference to this primary idea, in view of the Arab. salaf, invertere terram conserendi causa. It is moreover confirmed by salaf, praecedere, which is pervertere modified to praevertere. But how does &#1505;&#1500;&#1507; mean perversio (Theod. &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;), in the sense of the overthrow prepared for thy neighbour? The parallels demand the sense of a condition peculiar to the word and conduct of the godless (treacherous), <a href="/proverbs/22-12.htm">Proverbs 22:12</a> (cf. <a href="/exodus/23-8.htm">Exodus 23:8</a>), <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/19-3.htm">Proverbs 19:3</a>, thus perversitas, perversity; but this as contrary to truth and rectitude (opp. &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;), "perverseness," as we have translated it, for we understand by it want of rectitude (dishonesty) and untruthfulness. While the sincerity of the upright conducts them, and, so to say, forms their salvus conductus, which guards them against the danger of erring and of hostile assault, the perverseness of the treacherous destroys them; for the disfiguring of truth avenges itself against them, and they experience the reverse of the proverb, "das Ehrlich whrt am lngsten" (honesty endures the longest).
