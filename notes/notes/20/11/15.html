Considering how safe, and quiet, and easy the humble are, we see that with the lowly is wisdom. 3. An honest man's principles are fixed, therefore his way is plain. 4. Riches will stand men in no stead in the day of death. 5,6. The ways of wickedness are dangerous. And sin will be its own punishment. 7. When a godly man dies, all his fears vanish; but when a wicked man dies, his hopes vanish. 8. The righteous are often wonderfully kept from going into dangerous situations, and the ungodly go in their stead. 9. Hypocrites delude men into error and sin by artful objections against the truths of God's word. 10,11. Nations prosper when wicked men are cast down. 12. A man of understanding does not judge of others by their success. 13. A faithful man will not disclose what he is trusted with, unless the honour of God and the real good of society require it. 14. We shall often find it to our advantage to advise with others. 15. The welfare of our families, our own peace, and our ability to pay just debts, must not be brought into danger. But here especially let us consider the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ in becoming Surety even for enemies. 16. A pious and discreet woman will keep esteem and respect, as strong men keep possession of wealth. 17. A cruel, froward, ill-natured man, is vexatious to those that are, and should be to him as his own flesh, and punishes himself. 18. He that makes it his business to do good, shall have a reward, as sure to him as eternal truth can make it. 19. True holiness is true happiness. The more violent a man is in sinful pursuits, the more he hastens his own destruction. 20. Nothing is more hateful to God, than hypocrisy and double dealing, which are here signified. God delights in such as aim and act with uprightness. 21. Joining together in sin shall not protect the sinners. 22. Beauty is abused by those who have not discretion or modesty with it. This is true of all bodily endowments. 23. The wicked desire mischief to others, but it shall return upon themselves. 24. A man may grow poor by not paying just debts, not relieving the poor, not allowing needful expenses. Let men be ever so saving of what they have, if God appoints, it comes to nothing. 25. Both in temporal and spiritual things, God commonly deals with his people according to the measure by which they deal with their brethren. 26. We must not hoard up the gifts of God's bounty, merely for our own advantage. 27. Seeking mischief is here set against seeking good; for those that are not doing good are doing hurt, even to themselves.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the marginal reference.

Or in "breaking shall be broken" (q), ruined and undone; he engaging or becoming a bondsman for one whose circumstances he knew not; and these being bad bring a load upon him, such an heavy debt as crushes him to pieces. Mr. Henry observes that our Lord Jesus Christ became a surety for us when we were strangers, and he smarted for it, he was bruised and wounded for our sins; but then he knew our circumstances, and what the consequence would be, and became a surety on purpose to pay the whole debt and set us free; which he was capable of doing: without being broken or becoming a bankrupt himself; for he was not broken, nor did he fail, <a href="/isaiah/42-4.htm">Isaiah 42:4</a>. Jarchi's note is, <p>"the wicked shall be broken, to whose heart idolatry is sweet;'' <p>and he that hateth suretyship is sure; or those "that strike" (r), that is, with the hand, used in suretyship; see <a href="/proverbs/6-1.htm">Proverbs 6:1</a>; such an one is safe from coming into trouble by such means.

Vulgate, "who is cautious of snares," especially of the insidious dangers that lurk in suretyship. <span class="cmt_word">Is sure;</span> is at rest and has nothing to fear. There is no paronomasia in the Hebrew. The play on "suretyship" and "sure" in the Authorized Version is either accidental or was introduced with the idea of giving point to the sentence. The Septuagint translates differently, "A wicked man doeth evil when he mixes with the righteous; he hateth the sound of safety (<span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>)." This perhaps means that the fraudulent creditor deceives the good man who has stood security for him; and henceforward the good man cannot bear to hear immunity and safety spoken of (see note on Proverbs 20:16). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>9 The wicked with his mouth prepareth destruction for his neighbour;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; But by knowledge the righteous are delivered from it.<p>The lxx translate, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#768;&#x3c2; (&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;?) &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, (&#1497;&#1510;&#1500;&#1495;&#1493;). There is no reason for changing (with Hitzig and Ewald) the text, which in the form in which it is here translated was before all other translators (Aq., Symmachus, Theodotion, Syr., Targ., Jerome). The accentuation, which separates the two instrumental statements by greater disjunctives from that which follows, is correct. The "three" Greek versions viz. of Aquila, Theodotion, and Symmachus translate &#1495;&#1504;&#1507; by &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c2;, which it means in the modern idiom; but in the ancient Hebr. it signifies, him who is resolved upon evil, as in Arab. h&#803;anyf, him who is resolved upon that which is right: he who turns aside to evil enters on a path far removed from that which is right. In &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1497;&#1514; one is reminded (without any etymological reason) of &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1514; (pit), and so in &#1497;&#1495;&#1500;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468; of &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1495;&#1497;&#1514;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501; (<a href="/psalms/107-20.htm">Psalm 107:20</a>) or a similar word; but &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514; contains the reference, in this connection not easy to be mistaken, to the hostile purposes of the wicked masked by the words of the mouth, which are seen through by the righteous by virtue of knowledge which makes them acquainted with men. This penetrating look is their means of deliverance. </body></html>
