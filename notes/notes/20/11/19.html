Considering how safe, and quiet, and easy the humble are, we see that with the lowly is wisdom. 3. An honest man's principles are fixed, therefore his way is plain. 4. Riches will stand men in no stead in the day of death. 5,6. The ways of wickedness are dangerous. And sin will be its own punishment. 7. When a godly man dies, all his fears vanish; but when a wicked man dies, his hopes vanish. 8. The righteous are often wonderfully kept from going into dangerous situations, and the ungodly go in their stead. 9. Hypocrites delude men into error and sin by artful objections against the truths of God's word. 10,11. Nations prosper when wicked men are cast down. 12. A man of understanding does not judge of others by their success. 13. A faithful man will not disclose what he is trusted with, unless the honour of God and the real good of society require it. 14. We shall often find it to our advantage to advise with others. 15. The welfare of our families, our own peace, and our ability to pay just debts, must not be brought into danger. But here especially let us consider the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ in becoming Surety even for enemies. 16. A pious and discreet woman will keep esteem and respect, as strong men keep possession of wealth. 17. A cruel, froward, ill-natured man, is vexatious to those that are, and should be to him as his own flesh, and punishes himself. 18. He that makes it his business to do good, shall have a reward, as sure to him as eternal truth can make it. 19. True holiness is true happiness. The more violent a man is in sinful pursuits, the more he hastens his own destruction. 20. Nothing is more hateful to God, than hypocrisy and double dealing, which are here signified. God delights in such as aim and act with uprightness. 21. Joining together in sin shall not protect the sinners. 22. Beauty is abused by those who have not discretion or modesty with it. This is true of all bodily endowments. 23. The wicked desire mischief to others, but it shall return upon themselves. 24. A man may grow poor by not paying just debts, not relieving the poor, not allowing needful expenses. Let men be ever so saving of what they have, if God appoints, it comes to nothing. 25. Both in temporal and spiritual things, God commonly deals with his people according to the measure by which they deal with their brethren. 26. We must not hoard up the gifts of God's bounty, merely for our own advantage. 27. Seeking mischief is here set against seeking good; for those that are not doing good are doing hurt, even to themselves.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Deceitful work - Work which deceives and disappoints the worker; in contrast with the "sure reward" of the second clause.<p>Omit "shall be" and render, "but he that soweth righteousness worketh a sure reward." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19.

Or, is unto life: not mere outward acts of moral righteousness; these may be done where there is no principle of spiritual life, and are no other than dead works, and will never bring to everlasting life; indeed the best righteousness of man's is no justification of life, nor can it entitle to it, nor is meritorious of it. Godliness, or true holiness, has the promise of this life and that to come, <a href="/1_timothy/4-8.htm">1 Timothy 4:8</a>; and so here in the Hebrew text it is, "unto lives" (x), in the plural number. Internal grace, or powerful godliness, which is the new man that is created in righteousness, gives a meetness for everlasting life, and issues in it; particularly the righteousness of Christ, as that is a perfectly justifying one; it makes a man alive in a law sense, and gives a title and claim to eternal life; <p>so he that pursueth evil pursueth it to his own death; or, it is "to his own death"; it issues in that: not he that is overtaken in a fault, or falls into sin through the infirmity of the flesh and the force of temptation, but such who eagerly follow after it and overtake it; who give up themselves unto it, weary themselves in committing it, draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as it were with a cart rope; these often by their sins bring diseases upon them, which end in a corporeal death; or by means of which they come into the hand of the civil magistrate, and are capitally punished; and, however, die the second death, or an eternal one, the just wages of sin, <a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>. <p>(x) "ad vitas", Montanus. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/11.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">As righteousness tendeth to life: so he that pursueth evil pursueth it to his own death.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/11.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">19</span>. <span class="ital">As</span>] The Heb. word means <span class="ital">so</span>, but has also the sense of <span class="ital">firm, stedfast</span>, and is so used of character, <a href="/genesis/42-11.htm" title="We are all one man's sons; we are true men, your servants are no spies.">Genesis 42:11</a>; <a href="/genesis/42-19.htm" title="If you be true men, let one of your brothers be bound in the house of your prison: go you, carry corn for the famine of your houses:">Genesis 42:19</a>; <a href="/genesis/42-31.htm" title="And we said to him, We are true men; we are no spies:">Genesis 42:31</a>; <a href="/context/genesis/42-33.htm" title="And the man, the lord of the country, said to us, Hereby shall I know that you are true men; leave one of your brothers here with me, and take food for the famine of your households, and be gone:...">Genesis 42:33-34</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Render:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">He that is stedfast in righteousness</span> <span class="ital">is so</span> <span class="bld">unto life</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And he that pursueth evil</span> <span class="ital">doeth so</span> <span class="bld">unto his own death</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The rendering of R.V. marg., <span class="ital">So</span> (in like manner), connecting this proverb with that of the preceding verse, is less forcible and less in accordance with the style of this Book.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - This verse is not to be connected with the preceding, as in the margin of the Revised Version, "so righteousness," etc., each couplet in these chapters being independent, the connection, such as it is, being maintained by the use of catchwords, such as "righteous," "wicked," "upright," etc. <span class="cmt_word">As righteousness tendeth to life.</span> The various uses of the first word <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">ken</span>) have led to different renderings. The Authorized Version takes it for "as;" the Revised Version as an adjective: <span class="accented">He that is steadfast</span> <span class="accented">in righteousness.</span> It is, perhaps, better, with Nowack, to regard it as an adverb: "He who is honestly, strictly, of righteousness, is to life." The meaning is plain: real, genuine righteousness hath the promise of this life and of that which is to come (<a href="/1_timothy/4-8.htm">1 Timothy 4:8</a>). The LXX., reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">ben</span>), translate, "A righteous son is born for life." <span class="cmt_word">He that pursueth evil</span> (<a href="/proverbs/13-21.htm">Proverbs 13:21</a>); Septuagint, "the persecution of the impious," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> that which an impious man inflicts. But the Authorized Version is correct, and the clause means that he who practises evil brings ruin eventually on himself - a warning trite, but unheeded (comp. <a href="/proverbs/1-18.htm">Proverbs 1:18</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>13 He who goeth about tattling revealeth secrets;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But he who is of a faithful spirit concealeth a matter.<p>The tattler is called &#1512;&#1499;&#1497;&#1500; (intensive form of &#1512;&#1499;&#1500;), from his going hither and thither. &#1488;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; &#1512;&#1499;&#1497;&#1500;, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-9.htm">Ezekiel 22:9</a>, are men given to tattling, backbiters; &#1492;&#1493;&#1500;&#1498; &#1512;&#1499;&#1497;&#1500; (cf. <a href="/leviticus/19-16.htm">Leviticus 19:16</a>), one of the tattlers or backbiters goes, a divulger of the matter, a tell-tale. It is of such an one that the proverb speaks, that he reveals the secret (&#1505;&#1493;&#1491;, properly the being close together for the purpose of private intercourse, then that intercourse itself, vid., at <a href="/psalms/25-14.htm">Psalm 25:14</a>); one has thus to be on his guard against confiding in him. On the contrary, a &#1504;&#1488;&#1502;&#1503;&#1470;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;, firmus (fidus) spiritu, properly one who is established, or reflexively one who proves himself firm and true (vid., at <a href="/genesis/15-6.htm">Genesis 15:6</a>), conceals a matter, keeps it back from the knowledge and power of another. Zckler rightly concludes, in opposition to Hitzig, from the parallelism that the &#1492;&#1493;&#1500;&#1498; &#1512;&#1499;&#1497;&#1500; is subject; the arrangement going before also shows that this is the "ground-word" (Ewald); in <a href="/proverbs/20-19.htm">Proverbs 20:19</a> the relation is reversed: the revealer of secrets is rightly named (cf. Sir. 27:16, &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;, &#x3ba;.&#x3c4;.&#x3bb;.). </body></html>
