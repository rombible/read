Or, "the ancient border" or "boundary" (n); by which lands, estates, and inheritances, were marked, bounded, and distinguished; set by ancestors in agreement with their neighbours; which to remove was contrary to a law, and a curse is denounced upon those that did it, <a href="/deuteronomy/19-14.htm">Deuteronomy 19:14</a>; and was always reckoned a very heinous crime in early times; See Gill on <a href="/job/24-2.htm">Job 24:2</a>. This was so sacred a thing among the Romans, that they had a deity which presided over those bounds, and had its name from them. Some apply this, in a political sense, to laws of long standing, and customs of long prescription; and others interpret it, in a theological sense, of doctrines and practices settled by the fathers of the church; which, if understood of Christ and his apostles only, will be allowed; but if of the ancient fathers of the church that followed them, it should not be received; since they were but fallible men, and guilty of many errors and mistakes, both in doctrine and practice. <p>(n)  "terminum antiquum", Pagninus, Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator, Michaelis, Schultens. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/22.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Remove not the ancient landmark, which thy fathers have set.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/22.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">28</span>.

A tetrastich which, in its contents, connects itself with the last proverb of the Solomonic collection, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/22-16.htm">Proverbs 22:16</a>, forms the commencement of this collection:<p>22 Rob not the lowly because he is lowly;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And oppress not the humble in the gate.<p>23 For Jahve will conduct their cause,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And rob their spoilers of life.<p>Though it may bring gain, as said <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/22-16.htm">Proverbs 22:16</a>, to oppress the &#1491;&#1468;&#1500;, the lowly or humble, yet at last the oppressor comes to ruin. The poet here warns against robbing the lowly because he is lowly, and thus without power of defence, and not to be feared; and against doing injustice to the &#1506;&#1504;&#1497;, the bowed down, and therefore incapable of resisting in the gate, i.e., in the court of justice. These poor men have not indeed high human patrons, but One in heaven to undertake their cause: Jahve will conduct their cause (&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1489; &#1512;&#1497;&#1489;&#1501;, as at <a href="/proverbs/23-10.htm">Proverbs 23:10</a>), i.e., will undertake their vindication, and be their avenger. &#1491;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1488; (&#1491;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;), Aram. and Arab. dak&#803;k&#803; (cf. &#1491;&#1468;&#1511;&#1511;, Arab. dak&#803;k&#803;), signifies to crush anything so that it becomes broad and flat, figuratively to oppress, synon. &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511; (Fleischer). The verb &#1511;&#1489;&#1506; has, in Chald. and Syr., the signification to stick, to fix (according to which Aquila here translates &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd;, to nail; Jerome, configere); and as root-word to &#1511;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514;, the signification to be arched, like (Arab.) k&#803;ab', to be humpbacked; both significations are here unsuitable. The connection here requires the meaning to rob; and for <a href="/malachi/3-8.htm">Malachi 3:8</a> also, this same meaning is to be adopted, robbery and taking from one by force (Parchon, Kimchi), not: to deceive (Khler, Keil), although it might have the sense of robbing by withholding or refraining from doing that which is due, thus of a sacrilege committed by omission or deception. The Talm. does not know the verb &#1511;&#1489;&#1506; in this meaning; but it is variously found as a dialectic word for &#1490;&#1494;&#1500;.<p>(Note: Thus Rosch ha-schana 26b: Levi came once to N.N. There a man came to meet him, and cried out &#1511;&#1489;&#1506;&#1503; &#1508;&#1500;&#1504;&#1497;&#1488;. Levi knew not what he would say, and went into the Madrash-house to ask. One answered him: He is a robber (&#1490;&#1494;&#1500;&#1503;) said that one to thee; for it is said in the Scriptures (<a href="/malachi/3-8.htm">Malachi 3:8</a>), "Will a man rob God?" etc. (vid., Wissenschaft Kunst Judenthum, p. 243). In the Midrash, &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1495;&#1512; &#1496;&#1493;&#1489;, to <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/57-1.htm">Psalm 57:1-11</a>, R. Levi says that &#1488;&#1514;&#1492; &#1511;&#1497;&#1489;&#1506; &#1500;&#1497; is used in the sense of &#1488;&#1514;&#1492; &#1490;&#1493;&#1494;&#1500; &#1500;&#1497;. And in the Midrash Tanchuma, P. &#1514;&#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1492;, R. Levi answers the question, "What is the meaning of &#1511;&#1489;&#1506;, <a href="/malachi/3-8.htm">Malachi 3:8</a>?" - It is an Arabic expression. An Arabian, when he wishes to say to another &#1502;&#1492; &#1488;&#1514;&#1492; &#1490;&#1493;&#1494;&#1500;&#1504;&#1497;, says instead of it, &#1502;&#1492; &#1488;&#1514;&#1492; &#1511;&#1493;&#1489;&#1506;&#1504;&#1497;. Perhaps &#1511;&#1489;&#1506; is cogn. to &#1511;&#1489;&#1509;; the R. &#1511;&#1489; coincides in several groups of languages (also the Turkish k&#803;b) with the Lat. capere.)<p>Schultens' etymological explanation, capitium injicere (after Arab. k&#803;ab', to draw back and conceal the head), is not satisfactory. The construction, with the double accus., follows the analogy of &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; and the like, Gesen. 139. 2. Regarding the sing. &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;, even where several are spoken of, vid., under <a href="/proverbs/1-19.htm">Proverbs 1:19</a>. </body></html>
