Divine Providence has so ordered it, that some are rich, and others poor, but all are guilty before God; and at the throne of God's grace the poor are as welcome as the rich. 3. Faith foresees the evil coming upon sinners, and looks to Jesus Christ as the sure refuge from the storm. 4. Where the fear of God is, there will be humility. And much is to be enjoyed by it; spiritual riches, and eternal life at last. 5. The way of sin is vexatious and dangerous. But the way of duty is safe and easy. 6. Train children, not in the way they would go, that of their corrupt hearts, but in the way they should go; in which, if you love them, you would have them go. As soon as possible every child should be led to the knowledge of the Saviour. 7. This shows how important it is for every man to keep out of debt. As to the things of this life, there is a difference between the rich and the poor; but let the poor remember, it is the Lord that made the difference. 8. The power which many abuse, will soon fail them. 9. He that seeks to relieve the wants and miseries of others shall be blessed. 10. Profane scoffers and revilers disturb the peace. 11. God will be the Friend of a man in whose spirit there is no guile; this honour have all the saints. 12. God turns the counsels and designs of treacherous men to their own confusion. 13. The slothful man talks of a lion without, but considers not his real danger from the devil, that roaring lion within, and from his own slothfulness, which kills him. 14. The vile sin of licentiousness commonly besots the mind beyond recovery. 15. Sin is foolishness, it is in the heart, there is an inward inclination to sin: children bring it into the world with them; and it cleaves close to the soul. We all need to be corrected by our heavenly Father. 16. We are but stewards, and must distribute what God intrusts to our care, according to his will.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Train - Initiate, and so, educate.<p>The way he should go - Or, according to the tenor of his way, i. e., the path especially belonging to, especially fitted for, the individual's character.

This is the way  of the world (<a href="/proverbs/18-23.htm">Proverbs 18:23</a>). Aben Ezra explains the gnome as showing the advantage of wealth and the inconvenience of poverty; the former bringing power and pre-eminence, the latter trouble and servitude; and hence the moralist implies that every one should strive and labour to obtain a competency, and thus avoid the evils of impecuniosity. The borrower is servant to the lender. (For the relation between borrower and louder, or debtor and creditor, see on Proverbs 20:16; and comp. <a href="/matthew/18-25.htm">Matthew 18:25, 34</a>.) Delitzsch cites the German saying, "Borghart (borrower) is Lehnhart's (leader's) servant." We have the proverb, "He that goes a-borrowing goes a-sorrowing." The Septuagint departs from the other versions and our Hebrew text, translating, "The rich will role over the poor, and household servants will lend to their own masters" - a reading on which some of the Fathers have commented. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/21.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>31 The horse is harnessed for the day of battle;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But with Jahve is the victory,<p>i.e., it remains with Him to give the victory or not, for the horse is a vain means of victory, <a href="/isaiah/33-17.htm">Isaiah 33:17</a>; the battle is the Lord's, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-47.htm">1 Samuel 17:47</a>, i.e., it depends on Him how the battle shall issue; and king and people who have taken up arms in defence of their rights have thus to trust nothing in the multitude of their war-horses (&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;, horses, including their riders), and generally in their preparations for the battle, but in the Lord (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/20-8.htm">Psalm 20:8</a>, and, on the contrary, <a href="/isaiah/31-1.htm">Isaiah 31:1</a>).

Heb. has no word more fully covering this idea than &#1514;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1506;&#1492; (&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1506;&#1492;).<p>(Note: In the old High German, the word for war is urlag (urlac), fate, because the issue is the divine determination, and nt (as in "der Nibelunge Not"), as binding, confining, restraint; this nt is the correlate to &#1514;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1506;&#1492;, victory; &#1502;&#1500;&#1495;&#1502;&#1492; corresponds most to the French guerre, which is not of Romanic, but of German origin: the Werre, i.e., the Gewirre [complication, confusion], for &#1504;&#1500;&#1495;&#1501; signifies to press against one another, to be engaged in close conflict; cf. the Homeric &#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; of the turmoil of battle.) </body></html>
