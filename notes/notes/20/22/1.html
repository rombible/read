Divine Providence has so ordered it, that some are rich, and others poor, but all are guilty before God; and at the throne of God's grace the poor are as welcome as the rich. 3. Faith foresees the evil coming upon sinners, and looks to Jesus Christ as the sure refuge from the storm. 4. Where the fear of God is, there will be humility. And much is to be enjoyed by it; spiritual riches, and eternal life at last. 5. The way of sin is vexatious and dangerous. But the way of duty is safe and easy. 6. Train children, not in the way they would go, that of their corrupt hearts, but in the way they should go; in which, if you love them, you would have them go. As soon as possible every child should be led to the knowledge of the Saviour. 7. This shows how important it is for every man to keep out of debt. As to the things of this life, there is a difference between the rich and the poor; but let the poor remember, it is the Lord that made the difference. 8. The power which many abuse, will soon fail them. 9. He that seeks to relieve the wants and miseries of others shall be blessed. 10. Profane scoffers and revilers disturb the peace. 11. God will be the Friend of a man in whose spirit there is no guile; this honour have all the saints. 12. God turns the counsels and designs of treacherous men to their own confusion. 13. The slothful man talks of a lion without, but considers not his real danger from the devil, that roaring lion within, and from his own slothfulness, which kills him. 14. The vile sin of licentiousness commonly besots the mind beyond recovery. 15. Sin is foolishness, it is in the heart, there is an inward inclination to sin: children bring it into the world with them; and it cleaves close to the soul. We all need to be corrected by our heavenly Father. 16. We are but stewards, and must distribute what God intrusts to our care, according to his will.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Omit "good." The word is an insertion. To the Hebrew, "name" by itself conveyed the idea of good repute, just as "men without a name" (compare <a href="/job/30-8.htm">Job 30:8</a> margin) are those sunk in ignominy.

The word "good" is not in the text, but is rightly supplied, as it is by the Targum, Septuagint, and Vulgate Latin versions; for it is not any name that is more eligible than riches; nor is it a need name among any sort of persons; for to have a good name with some turns to a man's reproach rather than to his credit; but a good name among good men, a name in the house of God, which is better than sons and daughters; a new name, the name of the children of God, which no man knoweth but he that receiveth it; this is to be preferred to a multitude of riches: it is not to be procured by them, and is where they are not, or are lost, but this continues; see <a href="/ecclesiastes/7-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:1</a>; <p>and loving favour rather them silver and gold; favour with God and man, especially with God, whose loving kindness is better than life, and all the enjoyments of it: or, as it may be rendered, "grace is better than silver and gold" (p); the grace of God through Christ, the grace of Christ, in whom all fulness of it dwells, the grace of the Spirit of Christ; faith is more precious than gold that perisheth; and if a man would give all the substance of his house for love it would be contemned; the Spirit and his grace are not to be purchased for money. <p>(p)  "gratia melior", Munster, Tigurine version, Junius &amp; Tremellius, Michaelis; so Schultens. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/22.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">A <i>good</i> name <i>is</i> rather to be chosen than great riches, <i>and</i> <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> loving favour rather than silver and gold.</span><p>(a) Which comes by well doing.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/22.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">1</span>. <span class="ital">A</span> good <span class="ital">name</span>] Heb. <span class="bld">a name</span>, as in <a href="/ecclesiastes/7-1.htm" title="A good name is better than precious ointment; and the day of death than the day of one's birth.">Ecclesiastes 7:1</a>.

But this word carried with it the notion of good repute, as in <a href="/ecclesiastes/7-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:1</a>; for being well known implied honour and reputation, while being nameless (<a href="/job/30-8.htm">Job 30:8</a>) signified not only obscurity, but ignominy and discredit.

Grace (<span class="accented">chen</span>) is the manner and demeanour which win love, as well as the favour and affection gained thereby; taken as parallel to "name," in the former hemistich, it means here "favour," the regard conceived by others for a worthy object. Publ. Syr., "Bona opinio hominum tutier pecunia est." The French have a proverb, "Bonne renommee vaut mieux que ceinture doree." The latter hemistich gives the reason for the assertion in the former - a good name is so valuable because it wins affection and friendship, which are far preferable to material riches, <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/21.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>26 One always desireth eagerly;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the righteous giveth and holdeth not back.<p>Otherwise Fleischer: per totum diem avet avidus, i.e., avarus; but that in &#1492;&#1514;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492; &#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1492; the verb is connected with its inner obj. is manifest from <a href="/numbers/11-4.htm">Numbers 11:4</a>; it is the mode of expression which is called in the Greek syntax schema etymologicum, and which is also possible without an adj. joined to the obj., as in the &#x3c5;&#788;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3b8; &#787; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; (Eurip.
