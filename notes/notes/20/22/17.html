B. Michaelis, Fleischer), for between heart-purity and graciousness of speech there exists a moral relation, but yet no necessary connection of sequence; also not: he who loves purity of heart, and grace on his lips (Aben Ezra, Schelling, Bertheau), for "to love the grace of one's own lips" is an awkward expression, which sounds more like reprehensible self-complacency than a praiseworthy endeavour after gracious speech. Excellently Luther:<p>"He who has a true heart and amiable speech,<p>The king is his friend."<p>&#1496;&#1492;&#1493;&#1512;&#1470;&#1500;&#1489; is not adjectival, but substantival; &#1496;&#1492;&#1512;&#1470; is thus not the constr. of the mas. &#1496;&#1492;&#1493;&#1512;, as <a href="//biblehub.com/job/17-10.htm">Job 17:10</a>, but of the segolate &#1496;&#1492;&#1512;, or (since the ground-form of &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1492;&#1468;, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>, may be &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1492;&#1468; as well as &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1492;&#1468;) of the neut. &#1496;&#1492;&#1493;&#1512;, like &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;, <a href="/psalms/46-5.htm">Psalm 46:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/65-5.htm">Psalm 65:5</a> : that which is pure, the being pure  equals  purity (Schultens). &#1492;&#1503; &#1513;&#1474;&#1508;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493; (gracefulness of his lips) is the second subject with the force of a relative clause, although not exactly thus thought of, but: one loving heart-purity, gracefulness on his lips - the king is his friend. Ewald otherwise: "he will be the king's friend," after the scheme <a href="/proverbs/13-4.htm">Proverbs 13:4</a>; but here unnecessarily refined. A counsellor and associate who is governed by a pure intention, and connects therewith a gentle and amiable manner of speech and conversation, attaches the king to himself; the king is the &#1512;&#1506;&#1492; (&#1512;&#1506;), the friend of such an one, and he also is "the friend of the king," <a href="/1_kings/4-5.htm">1 Kings 4:5</a>. It is a Solomonic proverb, the same in idea as <a href="/proverbs/16-13.htm">Proverbs 16:13</a>. The lxx, Syr., and Targ. introduce after &#1488;&#1492;&#1489; the name of God; but 11b does not syntactically admit of this addition. But it is worth while to take notice of an interpretation which is proposed by Jewish interpreters: the friend of such an one is a king, i.e., he can royally rejoice in him and boast of him. The thought is beautiful; but, as the comparison of other proverbs speaking of the king shows, is not intended. </body></html>
