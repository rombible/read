God will punish him with poverty for his double and heinous sin. This exposition is given on the ground of our translation. But the vulgar Latin, which Luther and some others follow, evidently gives a more exact and literal interpretation of the Hebrew text, thus: <span class="ital">He that oppresseth the poor that he may increase his riches, gives to the rich only for poverty, </span>or, <span class="ital">to empoverish himself. </span>According to this; says Bishop Patrick, the paraphrase should be, “Such is the just providence of Almighty God, that he who, to enlarge his own estate or power, oppresses the poor by violence or deceit, shall meet with the like extortion from others more powerful than himself; and thereby be reduced to as poor a condition as those whom he oppressed.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/22.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>22:1 We should be more careful to do that by which we may get and keep a good name, than to raise or add unto a great estate. 2. Divine Providence has so ordered it, that some are rich, and others poor, but all are guilty before God; and at the throne of God's grace the poor are as welcome as the rich. 3. Faith foresees the evil coming upon sinners, and looks to Jesus Christ as the sure refuge from the storm. 4. Where the fear of God is, there will be humility. And much is to be enjoyed by it; spiritual riches, and eternal life at last. 5. The way of sin is vexatious and dangerous. But the way of duty is safe and easy. 6. Train children, not in the way they would go, that of their corrupt hearts, but in the way they should go; in which, if you love them, you would have them go. As soon as possible every child should be led to the knowledge of the Saviour. 7. This shows how important it is for every man to keep out of debt. As to the things of this life, there is a difference between the rich and the poor; but let the poor remember, it is the Lord that made the difference. 8. The power which many abuse, will soon fail them. 9. He that seeks to relieve the wants and miseries of others shall be blessed. 10. Profane scoffers and revilers disturb the peace. 11. God will be the Friend of a man in whose spirit there is no guile; this honour have all the saints. 12. God turns the counsels and designs of treacherous men to their own confusion. 13. The slothful man talks of a lion without, but considers not his real danger from the devil, that roaring lion within, and from his own slothfulness, which kills him. 14. The vile sin of licentiousness commonly besots the mind beyond recovery. 15. Sin is foolishness, it is in the heart, there is an inward inclination to sin: children bring it into the world with them; and it cleaves close to the soul. We all need to be corrected by our heavenly Father. 16. We are but stewards, and must distribute what God intrusts to our care, according to his will.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Better, He who oppresses the poor for his own profit gives.

But this is far-fetched, and the suggestion that by oppressing your neighbour you may after all prove to be his benefactor is out of harmony with the moral tone of this Book.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that oppresseth the poor to increase his riches</span> (so the Vulgate), <span class="cmt_word">and he that giveth to the rich, shall surely come to want.</span> There are various renderings and explanations of this verse. The Authorized Version says that he who oppresseth the poor to enrich himself, and he who wastes his means by giving to those who do not need it, will come to poverty. But the antithesis of this distich is thus lost. The Hebrew literally rendered brings out the contrast, <span class="accented">Whosoever oppresseth the poor, it is for his gain</span>; <span class="accented">whosoever giveth to the rich, it is for his loss.</span> Delitzsch explains the sentence thus: "He who enriches himself by extortion from the poor, at any rate gains what he desires; but he who gives to the rich impoverishes himself in vain, has no thanks, reaps only disappointment." One cannot but feel that the maxim thus interpreted is poor and unsatisfactory. The interpretation in the 'Speaker's Commentary' is more plausible: The oppressor of the poor will himself suffer in a similar mode, and will have to surrender his ill-gotten gains to some equally unscrupulous rich man. But the terse antithesis of the original is wholly obscured by this view of the distich. It is far better, with Hitzig, Ewald, and others, to take the gain in the first hemistich as that of the poor man, equivalent to "doth but bring him gain;" though the sentence is not necessarily to be explained as suggesting that the injustice which the poor man suffers at the hand of his wealthy neighbour is a stimulus to him to exert himself in order to better his position, and thus indirectly tends to his enrichment. The maxim is really conceived in the religious style of so many of these apparently worldly pronouncements, and states a truth in the moral government of God intimated elsewhere, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="/proverbs/13-22.htm">Proverbs 13:22</a>; <a href="/proverbs/28-8.htm">Proverbs 28:8</a>; and that truth is that the riches extorted from the poor man will in the end redound to his benefit, that by God's providential control the oppression and injustice from which he has suffered shall work to his good. In the second hemistich the loss is that of the rich man. By adding to the wealth of the rich the donor increases his indolence, encourages his luxury, vice, and extravagance, and thus leads to his ruin - "bringeth only to want. Septuagint, "He that calumniates (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>) the poor increaseth his own substance, but giveth to the rich at a loss (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;</span>)" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> so as to lessen his substance. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/22.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>10 Chase away the scorner, and contention goeth out,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And strife and reproach rest.<p>If in a company, a circle of friends, a society (lxx &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;), a wicked man is found who (vid., the definition of &#1500;&#1509;, <a href="/proverbs/21-24.htm">Proverbs 21:24</a>) treats religious questions without respect, moral questions in a frivolous way, serious things jestingly, and in his scornful spirit, his passion for witticism, his love of anecdote, places himself above the duty of showing reverence, veneration, and respect, there will arise ceaseless contentions and conflicts. Such a man one ought to chase away; then there will immediately go forth along with him dispeace (&#1502;&#1491;&#1493;&#1503;), there will then be rest from strife and disgrace, viz., of the strife which such a one draws forth, and the disgrace which it brings on the society, and continually prepares for it. &#1511;&#1500;&#1493;&#1503; is commonly understood of the injury, abuse, which others have to suffer from the scoffer, or also (thus Fleischer, Hitzig) of the opprobria of the contentious against one another.
