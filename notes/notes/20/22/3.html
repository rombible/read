But in foreseeing temporal calamities, and discerning the methods by which we may escape them, as Mr. Scott justly observes, we can seldom proceed beyond probability, in either respect; but, in the concerns of the soul, faith foresees the evil coming upon sinners in the eternal state, and discerns Jesus Christ, as the refuge from this impending storm, and the penitent and believing soul flees to him, hides himself in him, and is safe, as Noah in the ark. But the careless and unbelieving go on, without concern, till they lift up their eyes in hell, being in torments.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/22.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>22:1 We should be more careful to do that by which we may get and keep a good name, than to raise or add unto a great estate. 2. Divine Providence has so ordered it, that some are rich, and others poor, but all are guilty before God; and at the throne of God's grace the poor are as welcome as the rich. 3. Faith foresees the evil coming upon sinners, and looks to Jesus Christ as the sure refuge from the storm. 4. Where the fear of God is, there will be humility. And much is to be enjoyed by it; spiritual riches, and eternal life at last. 5. The way of sin is vexatious and dangerous. But the way of duty is safe and easy. 6. Train children, not in the way they would go, that of their corrupt hearts, but in the way they should go; in which, if you love them, you would have them go. As soon as possible every child should be led to the knowledge of the Saviour. 7. This shows how important it is for every man to keep out of debt. As to the things of this life, there is a difference between the rich and the poor; but let the poor remember, it is the Lord that made the difference. 8. The power which many abuse, will soon fail them. 9. He that seeks to relieve the wants and miseries of others shall be blessed. 10. Profane scoffers and revilers disturb the peace. 11. God will be the Friend of a man in whose spirit there is no guile; this honour have all the saints. 12. God turns the counsels and designs of treacherous men to their own confusion. 13. The slothful man talks of a lion without, but considers not his real danger from the devil, that roaring lion within, and from his own slothfulness, which kills him. 14. The vile sin of licentiousness commonly besots the mind beyond recovery. 15. Sin is foolishness, it is in the heart, there is an inward inclination to sin: children bring it into the world with them; and it cleaves close to the soul. We all need to be corrected by our heavenly Father. 16. We are but stewards, and must distribute what God intrusts to our care, according to his will.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Compare the margin reference.

St. Jerome has <span class="accented">callidus</span>, and the LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> the translation of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">arum</span>); but it must be taken in a good sense, as cautions, farseeing, prudent (see note on Proverbs 1:4) Such a man looks around, takes warning from little circumstances which might escape the observation of careless persons, and provides for his safety in good time. Thus the Christians at the siege of Jerusalem, believing Christ's warnings, retired to Pella, and wine saved. A Spanish proverb runs, "That which the fool does in the end, the wise man does at the beginning." <span class="cmt_word">The simple pass on, and are punished.</span> The subject of the former hemistich is in the singular number, for a really prudent man is a comparatively rare bring; the second clause is plural, teaching us, as Hitzig observes, that many simple ones are found for one prudent. These silly persons, blundering blindly on their way, without circumspection or forethought, meet with immediate punishment, incur dangers, suffer less. A Cornish proverb runs, "He who will not be ruled by the rudder must be ruled by the rock." Septuagint, "An intelligent man (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) seeing a wicked man punished is himself forcibly instructed; but fools pass by, and are punished" (comp. <a href="/proverbs/21-11.htm">Proverbs 21:11</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/21.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>28 A false witness shall perish;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But he who heareth shall always speak truth.<p>The lxx translate 28b by &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3c1; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;. Cappellus supposes that they read &#1500;&#1504;&#1510;&#1512; for &#1500;&#1504;&#1510;&#1492;, which, however, cannot mean "taking care." Hitzig further imagines &#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1495; for &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;, and brings out the meaning: "the man that rejoiceth to deliver shall speak." But where in all the world does &#1504;&#1510;&#1512; mean "to deliver"? It means, "to guard, preserve;" and to reach the meaning of "to deliver," a clause must be added with &#1502;&#1503;, as &#1502;&#1512;&#1506;. When one who speaks lies (&#1506;&#1491; &#1499;&#1468;&#1494;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501;), and a man who hears (&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1493;&#1502;&#1506;, plene, and with the orthophonic Dagesh), are contrasted, the former is one who fancifully or malevolently falsifies the fact, and the latter is one who before he speaks hears in order that he may say nothing that he has not surely heard. As &#1500;&#1489; &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/3-9.htm">1 Kings 3:9</a>, means an obedient heart, so here &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1493;&#1502;&#1506; means a man who attentively hears, carefully proves. Such an one will speak &#1500;&#1504;&#1510;&#1495;, i.e., not: according to the truth, and not: for victory (Aquila, Symmachus, Theodotion, &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;), i.e., so that accomplishes it (Oetinger); for the Heb. &#1504;&#1510;&#1495; has neither that Arab. nor this Aram. signification; but, with the transference of the root meaning of radiating or streaming over, to time, continuous existence (vid., Orelli, Synonyma der Zeit und Ewigkeit, pp. 96-97), thus: he will speak for continuance, i.e., either: without ever requiring to be silent, or, which we prefer: so that what he says stands; on the contrary, he who testifies mere fictions, i.e., avers that they are truth, is destroyed (28a  equals  <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/19-9.htm">Proverbs 19:9</a>, cf. 5): he himself comes to nothing, since his testimonies are referred to their groundlessness and falsity; for &#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1512; &#1488;&#1497;&#1503; &#1500;&#1493; &#1512;&#1490;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, the lie has no feet on which it can stand, it comes to nothing sooner or later. </body></html>
