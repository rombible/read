Divine Providence has so ordered it, that some are rich, and others poor, but all are guilty before God; and at the throne of God's grace the poor are as welcome as the rich. 3. Faith foresees the evil coming upon sinners, and looks to Jesus Christ as the sure refuge from the storm. 4. Where the fear of God is, there will be humility. And much is to be enjoyed by it; spiritual riches, and eternal life at last. 5. The way of sin is vexatious and dangerous. But the way of duty is safe and easy. 6. Train children, not in the way they would go, that of their corrupt hearts, but in the way they should go; in which, if you love them, you would have them go. As soon as possible every child should be led to the knowledge of the Saviour. 7. This shows how important it is for every man to keep out of debt. As to the things of this life, there is a difference between the rich and the poor; but let the poor remember, it is the Lord that made the difference. 8. The power which many abuse, will soon fail them. 9. He that seeks to relieve the wants and miseries of others shall be blessed. 10. Profane scoffers and revilers disturb the peace. 11. God will be the Friend of a man in whose spirit there is no guile; this honour have all the saints. 12. God turns the counsels and designs of treacherous men to their own confusion. 13. The slothful man talks of a lion without, but considers not his real danger from the devil, that roaring lion within, and from his own slothfulness, which kills him. 14. The vile sin of licentiousness commonly besots the mind beyond recovery. 15. Sin is foolishness, it is in the heart, there is an inward inclination to sin: children bring it into the world with them; and it cleaves close to the soul. We all need to be corrected by our heavenly Father. 16. We are but stewards, and must distribute what God intrusts to our care, according to his will.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>More literally, "He that loveth pureness of heart, his lips are gracious, the king is his friend." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. preserve&#8212;or guard.<p>knowledge&#8212;its principles and possessors.<p>overthroweth&#8212;utterly confounds and destroys the wicked.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/proverbs/22.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The eyes of the Lord preserve, </span> God by the watchful eye of his providence maintains and defends, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">knowledge, </span> to wit, men of knowledge; the abstract being put for the concrete, as <span class="ital">pride</span> is put for <span class="ital">a proud man</span>, <span class="bld"><a href="/psalms/36-11.htm" title="Let not the foot of pride come against me, and let not the hand of the wicked remove me.">Psalm 36:11</a></span>, <span class="ital">deceit</span> for <span class="ital">the deceitful</span>, as <span class="bld"><a href="/proverbs/12-17.htm" title="He that speaks truth shows forth righteousness: but a false witness deceit.">Proverbs 12:17</a></span>: so here <span class="ital">knowledge</span> for knowing and good men, such as the last verse spoke of, whose hearts are pure, and speeches gracious; not only the king shall be their friend, as he said there, but God also, which he adds here, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The words; </span> their false and flattering speeches, whereby they designed and expected to gain the favour and friendship of great men, which are opposed to the sincere and gracious speeches of good men, implied in the first cause of this verse, and expressed in the foregoing verse; or, as others render it, and the word is very commonly used, the matters; all his counsels, hopes, enterprises, and concerns. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/proverbs/22.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>The eyes of the Lord preserve knowledge,.... That is, the providence of God, whose eyes run to and fro throughout the whole earth; these preserve the knowledge of himself, even among the Heathens in some measure; for what may be known of God is manifest in them, and showed to them: more particularly his providence has preserved the Scriptures, the means of knowledge, which men would have destroyed; and preserves men of knowledge, as Aben Ezra interprets it, the ministers of the word, the stars he holds in his right hand; and he preserves spiritual and experimental knowledge in the hearts of his people, and causes it to increase; and continues his Gospel and a Gospel ministry in the world, till they all come to the unity of the faith, and the knowledge of the Son of God. Or his eyes observe, look unto with delight and pleasure, knowledge and men of knowledge, that know him, and do his will; <p>and he overthroweth the words of the transgressor; the perfidious, treacherous man; the false teacher, that corrupts the word of God, and handles it deceitfully: the doctrines of such he overthrows, and confutes, and brings to nothing, by his Spirit in his faithful ministers; and causes truth to prevail, and all iniquity to stop its mouth: particularly the words and doctrines of the great transgressor, the lawless and wicked one, the man of sin, antichrist; these have been exposed and overthrown already, and will be more and more so in God's due time. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/22.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The eyes of the LORD preserve <span class="cverse3">{h}</span> knowledge, and he overthroweth the words of the transgressor.</span><p>(h) Favour them that love knowledge.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/22.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">12</span>. <span class="ital">knowledge</span>] R.V. rightly inserts <span class="ital">him that hath</span>, before <span class="ital">knowledge</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">transgressor</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">treacherous man</span>, R.V.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The eyes of the Lord preserve knowledge</span>. The expression, "preserve knowledge," is found at Proverbs 5:2 (where see note) in the sense of "keep," "retain," and, taken by itself, it might here signify that the Lord alone possesses knowledge, and alone imparts it to his servants (<a href="/1_samuel/2-3.htm">1 Samuel 2:3</a>); but as in the following clause a person, the transgressor, is spoken of, it is natural to expect a similar expression in the former. The Revised Version is correct in rendering the abstract "knowledge" by the concrete "him that hath knowledge;" so that the clause says that God watches over and protects the man who knows him and walks in his ways, and uses his means and abilities for the good of others (see <a href="/proverbs/11-9.htm">Proverbs 11:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">But he</span> (the Lord) <span class="cmt_word">overthroweth</span> <span class="cmt_word">the words of the transgressor</span>. The transgressor here is the false, treacherous, perfidious man; and the gnome asserts that God frustrates by turning in another direction the outspoken intentions of this man, which he had planned against the righteous (comp. <a href="/proverbs/13-6.htm">Proverbs 13:6</a>; <a href="/proverbs/21-12.htm">Proverbs 21:12</a>).

The instruction of youth, the education of youth, ought to be conformed to the nature of youth; the matter of instruction, the manner of instruction, ought to regulate itself according to the stage of life, and its peculiarities; the method ought to be arranged according to the degree of development which the mental and bodily life of the youth has arrived at. The verb &#1495;&#1504;&#1498; is a denominative like &#1506;&#1511;&#1489;, <a href="/proverbs/22-4.htm">Proverbs 22:4</a>; it signifies to affect the taste, &#1495;&#1498; ( equals  &#1495;&#1504;&#1498;), in the Arab. to put date syrup into the mouth of the suckling; so that we may compare with it the saying of Horace, Ep. i. 2, 69: Quo semel est imbuta recens servabit odorem Testa diu. In the post-bibl. Heb. &#1495;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498; denotes that which in the language of the Church is called catechizatio; &#1495;&#1504;&#1493;&#1498; (&#1500;&#1504;&#1506;&#1512;) &#1505;&#1508;&#1512; is the usual title of the catechisms. It is the fundamental and first requisite of all educational instruction which the proverb formulates, a suitable motto for the lesson-books of pedagogues and catechists. &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; [from it] refers to that training of youth, in conformity with his nature, which becomes a second nature, that which is imprinted, inbred, becomes accustomed. <a href="/proverbs/22-6.htm">Proverbs 22:6</a> is wanting in the lxx; where it exists in MSS of the lxx, it is supplied from Theodotion; the Complut. translates independently from the Heb. text. </body></html>
