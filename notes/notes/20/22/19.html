By means of the words of the wise, or doctrines of the Gospel, faith in Christ is first had; men are directed and encouraged hereby to believe in him; and by the same means faith is increased, confirmed, and established. This is the end of penning the Scriptures, and of the Gospel ministry, as follows: <p>I have made known to thee this day, even to thee; the said words and doctrines in the ministry of the word, by the Spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of them; giving not only a notional, but a spiritual and experimental knowledge of them. The Lord has particular persons to whom he will make known these things in a saving way; it is "to thee, even to thee"; and to everyone whom God has chosen, and Christ has redeemed: and he has particular times and seasons for it, "this day"; which is a time of life and love; when darkness is removed, and the light of grace shines, and makes it day; and may respect the whole Gospel dispensation, which is the accepted time and day of salvation. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/22.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">That thy trust may be in <span class="cverse3">{m}</span> the LORD, I have made known to thee this day, even to thee.</span><p>(m) He shows what the end of wisdom is: that is, to direct us to the Lord.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/22.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">19</span>. <span class="ital">made known</span>] The R.V. <span class="ital">made</span> them <span class="ital">known</span>, makes the sense a little clearer.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That thy trust may be in the Lord.</span> The Greek and Latin versions make this clause depend on the preceding verse. It is better to consider it as dependent on the second hemistich, the fact of instruction being placed after the statement of its object. All the instruction herein afforded is meant to teach that entire confidence in the Lord which, as soon as his will is known and understood, leads a man to do it at any cost or pains, leaving the result in God's hands. <span class="cmt_word">I have made them known to thee this day, even to thee.</span> The repetition of the personal pronoun brings home the teaching to the disciple, and shows that it is addressed, not merely to the mass of men, but to each individual among them, who thus becomes responsible for the use which he makes of it (comp. <a href="/proverbs/23-15.htm">Proverbs 23:15</a>). The expression, "this day," further emphasizes the exhortation. The learner is not to remember vaguely that some time or other he received this instruction, but that on this particular  day the warning was given. So in <a href="/hebrews/3-7.htm">Hebrews 3:7, 13</a> we read, "As the Holy Ghost saith, Today if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.... Exhort one another daily, so long as it is called Today, lest any of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin." Septuagint, "That thy hope may be in the Lord, and he may make thy way known unto thee." Cheyne ('Job and Solomon') quotes Biekell's correction of this verse, "That thy confidence may be in Jehovah, to make known unto thee thy ways;" but the alteration seems arbitrary and unnecessary. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/22.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>13 The sluggard saith, "A lion is without,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I shall be slain in the midst of the streets."<p>Otherwise rendered, <a href="/proverbs/26-13.htm">Proverbs 26:13</a>. There, as here, the perf. &#1488;&#1502;&#1512; has the meaning of an abstract present, Gesen. 126. 3. The activity of the industrious has its nearest sphere at home; but here a work is supposed which requires him to go forth (<a href="/psalms/104-3.htm">Psalm 104:3</a>) into the field (<a href="/proverbs/24-27.htm">Proverbs 24:27</a>). Therefore &#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509; stands first, a word of wide signification, which here denotes the open country outside the city, where the sluggard fears to meet a lion, as in the streets, i.e., the rows of houses forming them, to meet a &#1512;&#1510;&#1495; (&#1502;&#1512;&#1510;&#1468;&#1495;), i.e., a murder from motives of robbery of revenge. This strong word, properly to destroy, crush, Arab. rad&#803;kh, is intentionally chosen: there is designed to be set forth the ridiculous hyperbolical pretence which the sluggard seeks for his slothfulness (Fleischer). Luther right well: "I might be murdered on the streets." But there is intentionally the absence of &#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497; [perhaps] and of &#1508;&#1468;&#1503; [lest]. Meri here quotes a passage of the moralists: &#1502;&#1502;&#1493;&#1508;&#1514;&#1497; &#1492;&#1506;&#1510;&#1500; &#1492;&#1504;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488;&#1492; (prophesying) belongs to the evidences of the sluggard; and Euchel, the proverb &#1492;&#1506;&#1510;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; &#1502;&#1514;&#1504;&#1489;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; (the sluggard's prophecy), i.e., the sluggard acts like a prophet, that he may palliate his slothfulness. </body></html>
