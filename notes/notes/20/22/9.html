Divine Providence has so ordered it, that some are rich, and others poor, but all are guilty before God; and at the throne of God's grace the poor are as welcome as the rich. 3. Faith foresees the evil coming upon sinners, and looks to Jesus Christ as the sure refuge from the storm. 4. Where the fear of God is, there will be humility. And much is to be enjoyed by it; spiritual riches, and eternal life at last. 5. The way of sin is vexatious and dangerous. But the way of duty is safe and easy. 6. Train children, not in the way they would go, that of their corrupt hearts, but in the way they should go; in which, if you love them, you would have them go. As soon as possible every child should be led to the knowledge of the Saviour. 7. This shows how important it is for every man to keep out of debt. As to the things of this life, there is a difference between the rich and the poor; but let the poor remember, it is the Lord that made the difference. 8. The power which many abuse, will soon fail them. 9. He that seeks to relieve the wants and miseries of others shall be blessed. 10. Profane scoffers and revilers disturb the peace. 11. God will be the Friend of a man in whose spirit there is no guile; this honour have all the saints. 12. God turns the counsels and designs of treacherous men to their own confusion. 13. The slothful man talks of a lion without, but considers not his real danger from the devil, that roaring lion within, and from his own slothfulness, which kills him. 14. The vile sin of licentiousness commonly besots the mind beyond recovery. 15. Sin is foolishness, it is in the heart, there is an inward inclination to sin: children bring it into the world with them; and it cleaves close to the soul. We all need to be corrected by our heavenly Father. 16. We are but stewards, and must distribute what God intrusts to our care, according to his will.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He that hath a bountiful eye - literally, as in the margin, contrasted with the "evil eye" of <a href="/proverbs/28-22.htm">Proverbs 28:22</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. a bountiful eye&#8212;that is, a beneficent disposition.<p>for he giveth &#8230; poor&#8212;His acts prove it.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/proverbs/22.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">He that hath a bountiful eye, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">a good eye</span>, he who looks upon the wants and miseries of others with compassion and kindness, as this phrase is used, <span class="bld"><a href="/matthew/20-15.htm" title="Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with my own?

The "good of eye" is the kindly looking, the benevolent man, in contrast to him of the evil eye, the envious, the unfriendly and niggardly man (<a href="/proverbs/23-6.htm">Proverbs 23:6</a>; <a href="/proverbs/28-22.htm">Proverbs 28:22</a>). St. Jerome renders, <span class="accented">Qui pronus est ad misericordiam.</span> Such a one is blessed by God in this world and the next, in time and in eternity, according to the sentiment of <a href="/proverbs/11-25.htm">Proverbs 11:25</a>. Thus in the temporal sense (Ecclus. 34 (31):23). "Him that is liberal in food lips shall bless, and the testimony of his liberality will be believed." Septuagint, "He that hath pity upon the poor shall himself be continually sustained (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>)." The reason is added, For he giveth of his brans to the poor. The blessing is the consequence of his charity and liberality. <a href="/2_corinthians/9-6.htm">2 Corinthians 9:6</a>, "He that soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>)." The Vulgate and Septuagint add a distich not in the Hebrew, <span class="accented">Victoriam et honorem acquiret qui dat munera</span>; <span class="accented">animam autem aufert accipientium</span>; <span class="greek">&#x39d;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1ff6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span>, "Victory and honour he obtaineth who giveth gifts; but he takes away the life of the possessors." The first hemistich appears to be a variant of <a href="/proverbs/19-6.htm">Proverbs 19:6</a><span class="accented">b</span>, the second to be derived from <a href="/proverbs/1-19.htm">Proverbs 1:19</a><span class="accented">b</span>. The second portion of the Latin addition may mean that the liberal man wins and carries away with him the souls of the recipients of his bounty. But this, though Ewald would fain have it so, cannot be the signification of the corresponding Greek, which seems to mean that the man who is so liberal in distributing gifts obtains the power to do so by oppressing and wronging others. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/22.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The group of proverbs beginning here terminates at <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/22-7.htm">Proverbs 22:7</a>, where, like the preceding, it closes with a proverb of the rich and the poor.<p>3 The prudent seeth the evil, and hideth himself;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; But the simple go forward, and suffer injury.<p>This proverb repeats itself with insignificant variations, <a href="/proverbs/27-12.htm">Proverbs 27:12</a>. The Ker&#305;&#770; &#1493;&#1504;&#1505;&#1514;&#1468;&#1512; makes it more conformable to the words there used. The Cheth&#305;&#770;b is not to be read &#1493;&#1497;&#1505;&#1514;&#1468;&#1512;, for this Kal is inusit., but &#1493;&#1497;&#1505;&#1468;&#1514;&#1512;, or much rather &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1505;&#1468;&#1514;&#1512;, since it is intended to be said what immediate consequence on the part of a prudent man arises from his perceiving an evil standing before him; he sees, e.g., the approaching overthrow of a decaying house, or in a sudden storm the fearful flood, and betimes betakes himself to a place of safety; the simple, on the contrary, go blindly forward into the threatening danger, and must bear the punishment of their carelessness. The fut. consec. 3a denotes the hiding of oneself as that which immediately follows from the being observant; the two perf. 3b, on the other hand, with or without &#1493;, denote the going forward and meeting with punishment as occurring contemporaneously (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/48-6.htm">Psalm 48:6</a>, and regarding these diverse forms of construction, at <a href="/habakkuk/3-10.htm">Habakkuk 3:10</a>). "The interchange of the sing. and plur. gives us to understand that several or many simple ones are found for one prudent man" (Hitzig). The Niph. of &#1506;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473; signifies properly to be punished by pecuniary fine (<a href="/exodus/21-22.htm">Exodus 21:22</a>) (cf. the post-bibl. &#1511;&#1504;&#1505;, &#1511;&#1504;&#1505;, to threaten punishment, which appears to have arisen from censere, to estimate, to lay on taxes); here it has the general meaning of being punished, viz., of the self-punishment of want of foresight. </body></html>
