Those employed for God may be driven from their work by a storm, yet they must go back to it. They did not say that they would not build a temple, but, Not yet. Thus men do not say they will never repent and reform, and be religious, but, Not yet. And so the great business we were sent into the world to do, is not done. There is a proneness in us to think wrongly of discouragements in our duty, as if they were a discharge from our duty, when they are only for the trial of our courage and faith. They neglected the building of God's house, that they might have more time and money for worldly affairs. That the punishment might answer to the sin, the poverty they thought to prevent by not building the temple, God brought upon them for not building it. Many good works have been intended, but not done, because men supposed the proper time was not come. Thus believers let slip opportunities of usefulness, and sinners delay the concerns of their souls, till too late. If we labour only for the meat that perishes, as the Jews here, we are in danger of losing our labour; but we are sure it shall not be in vain in the Lord, if we labour for the meat which lasts to eternal life. If we would have the comfort and continuance of temporal enjoyments, we must have God as our Friend. See also Lu 12:33. When God crosses our temporal affairs, and we meet with trouble and disappointment, we shall find the cause is, that the work we have to do for God and our own souls is left undone, and we seek our own things more than the things of Christ. How many, who plead that they cannot afford to give to pious or charitable designs, often lavish ten times as much in needless expenses on their houses and themselves! But those are strangers to their own interests, who are full of care to adorn and enrich their own houses, while God's temple in their hearts lies waste. It is the great concern of every one, to apply to the necessary duty of self-examination and communion with our own hearts concerning our spiritual state. Sin is what we must answer for; duty is what we must do. But many are quick-sighted to pry into other people's ways, who are careless of their own. If any duty has been neglected, that is no reason why it should still be so. Whatever God will take pleasure in when done, we ought to take pleasure in doing. Let those who have put off their return to God, return with all their heart, while there is time.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/haggai/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Ye have sown much - The prophet expresses the habitualness of these visitations by a vivid present. He marks no time and so expresses the more vividly that it was at all times. It is one continually present evil. "Ye have sown much and there is a bringing in little; there is eating and not to satisfy; there is drinking and not to exhilarate; there is clothing and not to be warm  It is not for the one or the other years, as, since the first year of Darius Hystaspis; it is one continued visitation, coordinate with one continued negligence. As long as the sin lasted, so long the punishment. The visitation itself was twofold; impoverished harvests, so as to supply less sustenance; and various indisposition of the frame, so that what would, by God's appointment in nature, satisfy, gladden, warm, failed of its effect. "And he that laboreth for hire, gaineth himself hire into a bag full of holes" (literally "perforated.") The labor pictured is not only fruitless, but wearisome and vexing. There is a seeming result of all the labor, something to allure hopes; but immediately it is gone. The pagan assigned a like baffling of hope as one of the punishments of hell , "Better and wiser to seek to be blessed by God, Who bestoweth on us all things. And this will readily come to those who choose to be of the same mind with Him and prefer what is for His glory to their own. For so saith the Saviour Himself to us <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/6-33.htm">Matthew 6:33</a>, Seek ye first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you."<p> "He loses good deeds by evil acts, who takes account of his good works, which he hits before his eyes, and forgets the faults which creep in between; or who, after what is good, returns to what is vain and evil" . "Money is seen in the pierced bag, when it is cast in, but when it is lost, it is not seen. They then who look how much they give, but do not weigh how much they gain wrongly, cast their rewards into a pierced bag. Looking to the Hope of their confidence they bring them together; not looking, they lose them."<p> "They lose the fruit of their labor, by not persevering to the end, or by seeking human praise, or by vain glory within, not keeping spiritual riches under the guardianship of humility. Such are vain and unprofitable men, of whom the Saviour saith, <a href="/matthew/6-2.htm">Matthew 6:2</a>. 'Verily I say unto you, they have their reward.

Nothing has prospered with you while you neglected your duty to God. The punishment corresponds to the sin. They thought to escape poverty by not building, but keeping their money to themselves; God brought it on them for not building (Pr 13:7; 11:24; Mt 6:33). Instead of cheating God, they had been only cheating themselves.<p>ye clothe &#8230; but &#8230; none warm&#8212;through insufficiency of clothing; as ye are unable through poverty from failure of your crops to purchase sufficient clothing. The verbs are infinitive, implying a continued state: "Ye have sown, and been bringing in but little; ye have been eating, but not to being satisfied; ye have been drinking, but not to being filled; ye have been putting on clothes, but not to being warmed" [Moore]. Careful consideration of God's dealings with us will indicate God's will regarding us. The events of life are the hieroglyphics in which God records His feelings towards us, the key to which is found in the Bible [Moore].<p>wages &#8230; put &#8230; into a bag with holes&#8212;proverbial for labor and money spent profitlessly (Zec 8:10; compare Isa 55:2; Jer 2:13). Contrast, spiritually, the "bags that wax not old, the treasure in heaven that faileth not" (Lu 12:33). Through the high cost of necessaries, those who wrought for a day's wages parted with them at once, as if they had put them into a bag with holes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/haggai/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> See <span class="bld"><a href="/haggai/1-5.htm" title="Now therefore thus said the LORD of hosts; Consider your ways.">Haggai 1:5</a></span>.

"Thus saith Jehovah, Though they be unconsumed, and therefore numerous, yet are they thus mowed down, and have passed away. I have bowed thee down, I will bow thee down no more. <a href="/nahum/1-13.htm">Nahum 1:13</a>. And now shall I break his yoke from off thee, and break thy fetters in pieces. <a href="/nahum/1-14.htm">Nahum 1:14</a>. And Jehovah hath given commandment concerning thee, no more of thy name will be sown: from the house of thy God I cut off graven image and molten work: I prepare thy grave; for thou art found light." To confirm the threat expressed in <a href="//biblehub.com/nahum/1-8.htm">Nahum 1:8-11</a>, Nahum explains the divine purpose more fully. Jehovah hath spoken: the completeness and strength of her army will be of no help to Nineveh. It is mowed down, because Judah is to be delivered from its oppressor. The words &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; to &#1493;&#1506;&#1489;&#1512; refer to the enemy, the warlike hosts of Nineveh, which are to be destroyed notwithstanding their great and full number. Sha&#770;le&#772;m, integer, with strength undiminished, both outwardly and inwardly, i.e., both numerous and strong. &#1493;&#1499;&#1503; &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, and so, i.e., of such a nature, just because they are of full number, or numerous. &#1493;&#1499;&#1503; &#1504;&#1490;&#1493;&#1494;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, and so, i.e., although of such a nature, they will nevertheless be mowed down. &#1490;&#1468;&#1494;&#1494;, taken from the mowing of the meadows, is a figure denoting complete destruction. &#1493;&#1506;&#1489;&#1512; is not impersonal, actum est, sc. de iis, but signifies it is away, or has vanished. The singular is used with special emphasis, the numerous army being all embraced in the unity of one man: "he paints the whole people as vanishing away, just as if one little man were carried off" (Strauss). With &#1493;&#1506;&#1504;&#1468;&#1514;&#1498; the address turns to Judah. The words are not applicable to the Assyrians, to whom Abarbanel, Grotius, Ewald, and Hitzig refer this clause; for Asshur is not only bowed down or chastened, but utterly destroyed. &#1506;&#1504;&#1468;&#1514;&#1498; refers to the oppression which Judah had suffered from the Assyrians in the time of Ahaz and Hezekiah. This shall not be repeated, as has already been promised in <a href="/nahum/1-9.htm">Nahum 1:9</a>. For now will the Lord break the yoke which this enemy has laid upon Judah. &#1493;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;, but now, is attached adversatively to &#1506;&#1504;&#1468;&#1514;&#1498;. The suffix to &#1502;&#1496;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; refers to the enemy, which has its seat in Nineveh. For the figure of the yoke, cf. <a href="/leviticus/26-13.htm">Leviticus 26:13</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/27-2.htm">Jeremiah 27:2</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/28-10.htm">Jeremiah 28:10</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-27.htm">Ezekiel 34:27</a>, etc.; and for the fact itself, <a href="/isaiah/10-27.htm">Isaiah 10:27</a>. The words do not refer to the people of the ten tribes, who were pining like slaves in exile (Hitzig); for Nahum makes no allusion to them at all, but to Judah (cf. <a href="/nahum/1-15.htm">Nahum 1:15</a>), upon whom the Assyrians had laid the yoke of tribute from the time of Ahaz. This was first of all shaken off in the reign of Hezekiah, through the overthrow of Sennacherib; but it was not yet completely broken, so long as there was a possibility that Assyria might rise again with new power, as in fact it did in the reign of Manasseh, when Assyrian generals invaded Judah and carried off this king to Babylon (<a href="/2_chronicles/33-11.htm">2 Chronicles 33:11</a>). It was only broken when the Assyrian power was overthrown through the conquest and destruction of Nineveh. This view, which is required by the futures 'eshbo&#772;r and 'a&#774;natte&#772;q, is confirmed by <a href="//biblehub.com/nahum/1-14.htm">Nahum 1:14</a>, for there the utter extermination of Assyria is clearly expressed. Vetsivva&#770;h is not a perfect with Vav rel.; but the Vav is a simple copula: "and ( equals  for) Jehovah has commanded." The perfect refers to the divine purpose, which has already been formed, even though its execution is still in the future. This purpose runs thus: "Of thy seed shall no more be sown, i.e., thou wilt have no more descendants" ("the people and name are to become extinct," Strauss; cf. <a href="/isaiah/14-20.htm">Isaiah 14:20</a>). It is not the king of Assyria who is here addressed, but the Assyrian power personified as a single man, as we may see from what follows, according to which the idols are to be rooted out along with the seed from the house of God, i.e., out of the idol temples (cf. <a href="/isaiah/37-38.htm">Isaiah 37:38</a>; <a href="/isaiah/44-13.htm">Isaiah 44:13</a>). Pesel and masse&#772;kha&#770;h are combined, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-15.htm">Deuteronomy 27:15</a>, to denote every kind of idolatrous image. For the idolatry of Assyria, see Layard's Nineveh and its Remains, ii. p. 439ff. &#1488;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1501; &#1511;&#1489;&#1512;&#1498; cannot mean, "I make the temple of thy god into a grave," although this meaning has already been expressed in the Chaldee and Syriac; and the Masoretic accentuation, which connects the words with what precedes, is also founded upon this view. If an object had to be supplied to &#1488;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1501; from the context, it must be pesel u&#772;masse&#772;kha&#770;h; but there would be no sense in "I make thine idol into a grave." There is no other course left, therefore, than to take &#1511;&#1489;&#1512;&#1498; as the nearest and only object to &#1488;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1501;, "I lay, i.e., prepare thy grave," &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1511;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, because, when weighed according to thy moral worth (<a href="/job/31-6.htm">Job 31:6</a>), thou hast been found light (cf. <a href="/daniel/5-27.htm">Daniel 5:27</a>). Hence the widespread opinion, that the murder of Sennacherib (<a href="/isaiah/37-38.htm">Isaiah 37:38</a>; <a href="/2_kings/19-37.htm">2 Kings 19:37</a>) is predicted here, must be rejected as erroneous and irreconcilable with the words, and not even so far correct as that Nahum makes any allusion to that event. He simply announces the utter destruction of the Assyrian power, together with its idolatry, upon which that power rested. Jehovah has prepared a grave for the people and their idols, because they have been found light when weighed in the balances of righteousness. </body></html>
