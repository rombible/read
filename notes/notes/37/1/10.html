Those employed for God may be driven from their work by a storm, yet they must go back to it. They did not say that they would not build a temple, but, Not yet. Thus men do not say they will never repent and reform, and be religious, but, Not yet. And so the great business we were sent into the world to do, is not done. There is a proneness in us to think wrongly of discouragements in our duty, as if they were a discharge from our duty, when they are only for the trial of our courage and faith. They neglected the building of God's house, that they might have more time and money for worldly affairs. That the punishment might answer to the sin, the poverty they thought to prevent by not building the temple, God brought upon them for not building it. Many good works have been intended, but not done, because men supposed the proper time was not come. Thus believers let slip opportunities of usefulness, and sinners delay the concerns of their souls, till too late. If we labour only for the meat that perishes, as the Jews here, we are in danger of losing our labour; but we are sure it shall not be in vain in the Lord, if we labour for the meat which lasts to eternal life. If we would have the comfort and continuance of temporal enjoyments, we must have God as our Friend. See also Lu 12:33. When God crosses our temporal affairs, and we meet with trouble and disappointment, we shall find the cause is, that the work we have to do for God and our own souls is left undone, and we seek our own things more than the things of Christ. How many, who plead that they cannot afford to give to pious or charitable designs, often lavish ten times as much in needless expenses on their houses and themselves! But those are strangers to their own interests, who are full of care to adorn and enrich their own houses, while God's temple in their hearts lies waste. It is the great concern of every one, to apply to the necessary duty of self-examination and communion with our own hearts concerning our spiritual state. Sin is what we must answer for; duty is what we must do. But many are quick-sighted to pry into other people's ways, who are careless of their own. If any duty has been neglected, that is no reason why it should still be so. Whatever God will take pleasure in when done, we ought to take pleasure in doing. Let those who have put off their return to God, return with all their heart, while there is time.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/haggai/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Therefore, for you, - on your account; (As in <a href="/psalms/44-43.htm">Psalm 44:43</a>.) for your sins, (Jon.) He points out the moral cause of the drought, whereas men think of this or that cause of the variations of the seasons, and we, e. g., take into our mouths Scriptural words, as "murrain of cattle," and the like, and think of nothing less than why it was sent, or who sent it. Haggai directs the mind to the higher Cause, that as they withheld their service from God, so, on their account and by His will, His creatures withheld  their service from them. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/haggai/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. heaven &#8230; is stayed from dew&#8212;literally, "stays itself."

But there would be something of tautology in this, because the same thing has been said in the first word of the verse, “therefore” (on account of what has been mentioned in the preceding verses) has this judgment come upon you. It is better therefore to take it, as in A. V., and R. V. margin, “the heaven over you.” Compare the terms in which the judgment had been threatened by Moses, “thy heaven that is over thy head shall be brass,” <a href="/deuteronomy/28-23.htm" title="And your heaven that is over your head shall be brass, and the earth that is under you shall be iron.">Deuteronomy 28:23</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">from dew</span>] not rain only, but even dew had been withholden. “Coeli non solum pluviam non dederunt, sed ne rorem quidem, quo arentes agri saltem humore modico temperarentur.” Hieron. We must not forget how copious, and therefore how important to the husbandman, especially in the absence of rain, was the dew in Palestine. “In a latitude so high as ours, and which yet has a mean temperature higher than its degrees should give it, the chill of the night serves only to shed fog or mist upon the lower stratum of air; but in warmer climates—and in no country is it more so than in Syria—the vast burden of the watery element, which the fervour of day has raised aloft, becomes, quickly after sunset, a prodigious dew, breaking down upon the earth, as a mighty yet noiseless deluge.” Isaac Taylor, <span class="ital">Spirit of Heb.

On the importance of dew in the climate of Palestine, see note on Micah 5:7. The dews generally are remarkably heavy, and in the summer months take the place of rain. Dr. Thomson speaks of the dew rolling in the morning off his tent like rain ('Land and the Book,' p. 491). <span class="cmt_word">The earth is stayed from her fruit;</span> <span class="accented">hath stayed her fruit</span>; according to the threat (<a href="/deuteronomy/11-17.htm">Deuteronomy 11:17</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/nahum/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>With <a href="/nahum/2-1.htm">Nahum 2:1</a> the prophecy turns to Nineveh. <a href="/nahum/2-1.htm">Nahum 2:1</a>. "A dasher in pieces comes against thee. Keep thy fortress! Look out upon the way, fortify the loins, exert thy strength greatly! <a href="/nahum/2-2.htm">Nahum 2:2</a>. For Jehovah returneth to the eminence of Jacob as to the eminence of Israel; for plunderers have plundered them, and their vines have they thrown to the ground." &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1498; cannot be addressed to Judah, as in <a href="/nahum/1-15.htm">Nahum 1:15</a> (Chald., Rashi, etc.). It cannot indeed be objected that in <a href="/nahum/1-15.htm">Nahum 1:15</a> the destruction of Asshur has already been announced, since the prophet might nevertheless have returned to the time when Asshur had made war upon Judah, in order to depict its ruin with greater precision. But such an assumption does not agree with the second clause of the verse as compared with <a href="//biblehub.com/nahum/2-2.htm">Nahum 2:2</a>, and still less with the description of the approaching enemy which follows in <a href="//biblehub.com/nahum/2-3.htm">Nahum 2:3</a>, since this is unquestionably, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/nahum/2-5.htm">Nahum 2:5</a>, the power advancing against Nineveh, and destroying that city. We must therefore assume that we have here a sudden change in the person addressed, as in <a href="/nahum/1-11.htm">Nahum 1:11</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/nahum/1-12.htm">Nahum 1:12</a>, <a href="/nahum/1-13.htm">Nahum 1:13</a> and <a href="/nahum/1-14.htm">Nahum 1:14</a>. The enemy is called &#1502;&#1508;&#1497;&#1509;, "a dasher in pieces;" not a war-hammer (cf. <a href="/proverbs/25-18.htm">Proverbs 25:18</a>), because &#1506;&#1500;&#1492;, the standing expression for the advance of a hostile army, does not agree with this. &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1498;, against thy face, i.e., pitching his tent opposite to the city (there is no good reason for altering the suffix into &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1498;, as Ewald and Hitzig propose). Against this enemy Nineveh is to bring all possible power of resistance. This is not irony, but simply a poetical turn given to the thought, that Nineveh will not be able to repulse this enemy any more. The inf. abs. na&#770;tso&#772;r stands emphatically for the imperative, as is frequently the case, and is continued in the imperative. Metsu&#772;ra&#770;h is the enclosure of a city, hence the wall or fortification. &#1510;&#1508;&#1468;&#1492;&#1470;&#1491;&#1512;&#1498;, looking watchfully upon the way by which the enemy comes, to repulse it or prevent it from entering the city. &#1492;&#1494;&#1468;&#1511; &#1502;, make the loins strong, i.e., equip thyself with strength, the loins being the seat of strength. The last clause expresses the same thought, and is merely added to strengthen the meaning. The explanatory k&#305;&#772; in <a href="/nahum/2-2.htm">Nahum 2:2</a> (3) does not follow upon <a href="/nahum/2-1.htm">Nahum 2:1</a> in the sense of "summon up all thy strength, for it is God in whose strength the enemy fights" (Strauss), but to <a href="/nahum/2-1.htm">Nahum 2:1</a> or <a href="/nahum/1-15.htm">Nahum 1:15</a>. The train of thought is the following: Asshur will be utterly destroyed by the enemy advancing against Nineveh, for Jehovah will re-establish the glory of Israel, which Asshur has destroyed. &#1513;&#1473;&#1489; (perf. proph.) has not the force of the hiphil, reducere, restituere, either here or in <a href="/psalms/85-5.htm">Psalm 85:5</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/52-8.htm">Isaiah 52:8</a>, and other passages, where the modern lexicons give it, but means to turn round, or return to a person, and is construed with the accusative, as in <a href="/numbers/10-36.htm">Numbers 10:36</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/4-20.htm">Exodus 4:20</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/50-14.htm">Genesis 50:14</a>, although in actual fact the return of Jehovah to the eminence of Jacob involves its restoration. &#1490;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1503; &#1497;&#1506;&#1511;&#1489;, that of which Jacob is proud, i.e., the eminence and greatness or glory accruing to Israel by virtue of its election to be the nation of God, which the enemy into whose power it had been given up on account of its rebellion against God had taken away (see at <a href="/amos/6-8.htm">Amos 6:8</a>). Jacob does not stand for Judah, nor Israel for the ten tribes, for Nahum never refers to the ten tribes in distinction from Judah; and <a href="//biblehub.com/obadiah/1-18.htm">Obadiah 1:18</a>, where Jacob is distinguished from the house of Joseph, is of a totally different character. Both names stand here for the whole of Israel (of the twelve tribes), and, as Cyril has shown, the distinction is this: Jacob is the natural name which the people inherited from their forefather, and Israel the spiritual name which they had received from God. Strauss gives the meaning correctly thus: Jehovah will so return to the eminence of His people, who are named after Jacob, that this eminence shall become the eminence of Israel, i.e., of the people of God; in other words, He will exalt the nation once more to the lofty eminence of its divine calling (&#1499;&#1468; used in the same manner as in <a href="/1_samuel/25-36.htm">1 Samuel 25:36</a>). This will He do, because plunderers have plundered (ba&#770;qaq, evacuare) them (the Israelites), and destroyed their vines, cast them to the ground; that He may avenge the reproach cast upon His people. The plunderers are the heathen nations, especially the Assyrians. The vines are the Israelites; Israel as a people or kingdom is the vineyard (<a href="/isaiah/5-1.htm">Isaiah 5:1</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/12-10.htm">Jeremiah 12:10</a>; <a href="/psalms/80-9.htm">Psalm 80:9</a>.); the vines are the families, and the branches (zemo&#772;r&#305;&#772;m from zemo&#772;ra&#770;h) the members. </body></html>
