In what<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>follows, we shall find both agreeing well enough to clear the<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>unlikelihood of Darius Nothus being the king intended here.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Both accounts make the captivity to end in the seventieth year,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>according to the Scripture. But now the former account makes it one<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>hundred and nine years between Cyrus’s decree and Darius’s decree; all<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>which time the temple by this account lay desolate, without a prophet<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>to stir them up to their duty of building the temple. Now is this<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>probable? can it be reasonably supposed that the temple should so long<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>lie waste after they were sent out of Babylon purposely to build it? or<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>that they should be so long in that condition without a prophet? But<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>now the latter account reckons seventeen years between Cyrus’s and<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Darius’s decree for building the temple, a space of time easily<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>conceived likely to pass while the Jews did not build; nay, were<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>forbidden by Cambyses, (in Scripture called Artaxerxes,) viceroy to his<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>father Cyrus, (engaged in foreign wars,) all the time Cyrus lived after<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>he gave out the decree, which some make more, some less, but those who<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>make the likeliest guess, for aught I know, make it five years. Whether<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Cyrus, taken up with these wars, did know of this prohibition, or<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>thought not good to take it off till he returned conqueror, I know not;<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>but he died and left this bar on the work, which continued all<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Cambyses’s reign, and unto the second year of his successor Darius<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Hystaspes. Now if this were seventeen the most, some say but fifteen,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>others but twelve years, it is very probable, whereas one hundred and<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>nine years is utterly improbable. Besides this, let us view what age<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>those many or few were of, by these different accounts, who lived to<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>see the temple re-edified. If in Darius Nothus’s time, they could be no<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>less than one hundred and eighty-five, allowing them to be sixteen at<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>the burning of the temple, thus; sixteen when the temple was burnt,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>thence sixty to Cyrus’s decree, and thence one hundred and nine to<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Darius Nothus’s decree. But by the latter account their age amounts but<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>to ninety-five years, which appears thus; sixteen at the time the<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>temple was burnt, thence sixty to Cyrus’s decree, thence seventeen to<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Darius Hystaspes’s decree; in all ninety-five, which though a great<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>age, yet not improbable at that time, though the other (one hundred and<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>eighty-five) be improbable. Besides, how few through one hundred and<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>sixty-nine years can distinctly remember what they saw and took notice<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>of at sixteen, or could make that judgment of the disproportion between<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>the two temples! <span class="bld"><a href="/haggai/2-3.htm" title="Who is left among you that saw this house in her first glory? and how do you see it now? is it not in your eyes in comparison of it as nothing?">Haggai 2:3</a></span>.

The note of time in this verse (which obviously belongs to this chapter, and not as in some editions both of Heb. and LXX. and in some MSS. to the next) seems designed to shew how prompt the response was to the prophet’s call. Only twenty-three days, little more that is than three weeks, had sufficed to make all necessary preparations, and summon workmen from all the neighbourhood to resume the work (ch. <a href="/haggai/1-1.htm" title="In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, in the first day of the month, came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, saying,">Haggai 1:1</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/haggai/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the four and twentieth day of the sixth month.</span> The first admonition had been made on the first day of this month; the three intervening weeks had doubtless been spent in planning and preparing materials, and obtaining workmen from the neighbouring villages. The note of time is introduced to show how prompt was their obedience, and the exact time when "they came and did work in the house of the Lord" (ver. 14). Some, on insufficient grounds, consider this clause to be an interpolation from <a href="/haggai/2-10.htm">Haggai 2:10, 18</a>, with a change of "ninth" to "sixth month." In the Latin Vulgate, in Tischendorf's Septuagint, and in many editions of the Hebrew Bible, the whole of this verse is wrongly annexed to the following chapter. St. Jerome arranges it as in the Authorized Version. It is possible that, as St. Cyril takes it, the words, <span class="cmt_word">in the second year of Darius the king,</span> ought to begin ch. 2. The king's reign has been already notified in ver. 1, and it seems natural to affix the date at the commencement of the second address. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/nahum/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Assyrian tries to repel this attack, but all in vain. <a href="/nahum/2-5.htm">Nahum 2:5</a>. "He remembers his glorious ones: they stumble in their paths; they hasten to the wall of it, and the tortoise is set up. <a href="/nahum/2-6.htm">Nahum 2:6</a>. The gates are opened in the rivers, and the palace is dissolved. <a href="/nahum/2-7.htm">Nahum 2:7</a>. It is determined: she is laid bare, carried off, and her maids groan like the cry of doves, smiting on their breasts." On the approach of the war-chariots of the enemy to the attack, the Assyrian remembers his generals and warriors, who may possibly be able to defend the city and drive back the foe. That the subject changes with yizko&#772;r, is evident from the change in the number, i.e., from the singular as compared with the plurals in <a href="/nahum/2-3.htm">Nahum 2:3</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/nahum/2-4.htm">Nahum 2:4</a>, and is placed beyond the reach of doubt by the contents of <a href="/nahum/2-5.htm">Nahum 2:5</a>., which show that the reference is to the attempt to defend the city. The subject to yizko&#772;r is the Assyrian (&#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;, <a href="/nahum/2-1.htm">Nahum 2:1</a>), or the king of Asshur (<a href="/nahum/3-18.htm">Nahum 3:18</a>). He remembers his glorious ones, i.e., remembers that he has 'add&#305;&#772;r&#305;&#772;m, i.e., not merely generals (&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;, lxx), but good soldiers, including the generals (as in <a href="/nahum/3-18.htm">Nahum 3:18</a>; <a href="/judges/5-13.htm">Judges 5:13</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/3-5.htm">Nehemiah 3:5</a>). He sends for them, but they stumble in their paths. From terror at the violent assault of the foe, their knees lose their tension (the plural ha&#774;l&#305;&#772;kho&#772;th is not to be corrected into the singular according to the keri, as the word always occurs in the plural). They hasten to the wall of it (Nineveh); there is &#1492;&#1505;&#1468;&#1499;&#1498; set up: i.e., literally the covering one, not the defender, praesidium militare (Hitzig), but the tortoise, testudo.<p>(Note: Not, however, the tortoise formed by the shields of the soldiers, held close together above their heads (Liv. xxxiv. 9), since these are never found upon the Assyrian monuments (vid., Layard), but a kind of battering-ram, of which there are several different kinds, either a moveable tower, with a battering-ram, consisting of a light framework, covered with basket-work, or else a framework without any tower, either with an ornamented covering, or simply covered with skins, and moving upon four or six wheels. See the description, with illustrations, in Layard's Nineveh, ii. pp. 366-370, and Strauss's commentary on this passage.)<p>The prophet's description passes rapidly from the assault upon the city wall to the capture of the city itself (<a href="/nahum/2-6.htm">Nahum 2:6</a>). The opened or opening gates of the rivers are neither those approaches to the city which were situated on the bank of the Tigris, and were opened by the overflowing of the river, in support of which appeal has been made to the statement of Diodor. Sic. ii. 27, that the city wall was destroyed for the space of twenty stadia by the overflowing of the Tigris; for "gates of the rivers" cannot possibly stand for gates opened by rivers. Still less can it be those roads of the city which led to the gates, and which were flooded with people instead of water (Hitzig), or with enemies, who were pressing from the gates into the city like overflowing rivers (Ros.); nor even gates through which rivers flow, i.e., sluices, namely those of the concentric canals issuing from the Tigris, with which the palace could be laid under water (Vatabl., Burck, Hitzig, ed. 1); but as Luther renders it, "gates on the waters," i.e., situated on the rivers, or gates in the city wall, which were protected by the rivers; "gates most strongly fortified, both by nature and art" (Tuch, de Nino urbe, p. 67, Strauss, and others), for neha&#770;ro&#772;th must be understood as signifying the Tigris and its tributaries and canals. At any rate, there were such gates in Nineveh, since the city, which stood at the junction of the Khosr with the Tigris, in the slope of the (by no means steep) rocky bank, was to some extent so built in the alluvium, that the natural course of the Khosr had to be dammed off from the plain chosen for the city by three stone dams, remnants of which are still to be seen; and a canal was cut above this point, which conducted the water to the plain of the city, where it was turned both right and left into the city moats, but had a waste channel through the city. To the south, however, another small collection of waters helped to fill the trenches. "The wall on the side towards the river consisted of a slightly curved line, which connected together the mouths of the trenches, but on the land side it was built at a short distance from the trenches. The wall on the river side now borders upon meadows, which are only flooded at high water; but the soil has probably been greatly elevated, and at the time when the city was built this was certainly river" (see M. v. Niebuhr, Geschichte Assurs u. Babels, p. 280; and the outlines of the plan of the ground oh which Nineveh stood, p. 284). The words of the prophet are not to be understood as referring to any particular gate, say the western, either alone, or par excellence, as Tuch supposes, but apply quite generally to the gates of the city, since the rivers are only mentioned for the purpose of indicating the strength of the gates. As Luther has correctly explained it, "the gates of the rivers, however firm in other respects, and with no easy access, will now be easily occupied, yea, have been already opened." The palace melts away, not, however, from the floods of water which flow through the open gates. This literal rendering of the words is irreconcilable with the situation of the palaces in Nineveh, since they were built in the form of terraces upon the tops of hills, either natural or artificial, and could not be flooded with water. The words are figurative. mu&#772;g, to melt, dissolve, i.e., to vanish through anxiety and alarm; and &#1492;&#1497;&#1499;&#1500;, the palace, for the inhabitants of the palace. "When the gates, protected by the rivers, are broken open by the enemy, the palace, i.e., the reigning Nineveh, vanishes in terror" (Hitzig). For her sway has now come to an end.<p>&#1492;&#1510;&#1468;&#1489;: the hophal of &#1504;&#1510;&#1489;, in the hiphil, to establish, to determine (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-8.htm">Deuteronomy 32:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/74-17.htm">Psalm 74:17</a>; and Chald. <a href="/daniel/2-45.htm">Daniel 2:45</a>; <a href="/daniel/6-13.htm">Daniel 6:13</a>); hence it is established, i.e., is determined, sc. by God: she will be made bare; i.e., Nineveh, the queen, or mistress of the nations, will be covered with shame. &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1514;&#1492; is not to be taken as interchangeable with the hophal &#1492;&#1490;&#1500;&#1492;, to be carried away, but means to be uncovered, after the piel to uncover, sc. the shame or nakedness (<a href="/nahum/3-5.htm">Nahum 3:5</a>; cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/47-2.htm">Isaiah 47:2-3</a>; <a href="/hosea/2-12.htm">Hosea 2:12</a>). &#1492;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492;, for &#1492;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492; (see Ges. 63, Anm. 4), to be driven away, or led away, like the niph. in <a href="/jeremiah/37-11.htm">Jeremiah 37:11</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/2-27.htm">2 Samuel 2:27</a>.<p>(Note: Of the different explanations that have been given of this hemistich, the supposition, which dates back as far as the Chaldee, that huzzab signifies the queen, or is the name of the queen (Ewald and Rckert), is destitute of any tenable foundation, and is no better than Hitzig's fancy, that we should read &#1493;&#1492;&#1510;&#1468;&#1489;, "and the lizard is discovered, fetched up," and that this "reptile" is Nineveh. The objection offered to our explanation, viz., that it would only be admissible if it were immediately followed by the decretum divinum in its full extent, and not merely by one portion of it, rests upon a misinterpretation of the following words, which do not contain merely a portion of the purpose of God.)<p>The laying bare and carrying away denote the complete destruction of Nineveh. &#1488;&#1502;&#1492;&#1514;&#1497;&#1492;, ancillae ejus, i.e., Nini.

Tophe&#772;ph, to smite, used for the smiting of the timbrels in <a href="/psalms/68-26.htm">Psalm 68:26</a>; here, to smite upon the breast. Compare pectus pugnis caedere, or palmis infestis tundere (e.g., Juv. xiii. 167; Virg. Aen. i. 481, and other passages), as an expression of violent agony in deep mourning (cf. <a href="/luke/18-13.htm">Luke 18:13</a>; <a href="/luke/23-27.htm">Luke 23:27</a>). &#1500;&#1489;&#1489;&#1492;&#1503; for &#1500;&#1489;&#1489;&#1497;&#1492;&#1503; is the plural, although this is generally written &#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;; and as the &#1497; is frequently omitted as a sign of the plural (cf. Ewald, 258, a), there is no good ground for reading &#1500;&#1489;&#1489;&#1492;&#1503;, as Hitzig proposes. </body></html>
