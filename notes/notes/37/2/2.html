But they could not build such a temple then, as Solomon built. Though our gracious God is pleased if we do as well as we can in his service, yet our proud hearts will scarcely let us be pleased, unless we do as well as others, whose abilities are far beyond ours. Encouragement is given the Jews to go on in the work notwithstanding. They have God with them, his Spirit and his special presence. Though he chastens their transgressions, his faithfulness does not fail. The Spirit still remained among them. And they shall have the Messiah among them shortly; He that should come. Convulsions and changes would take place in the Jewish church and state, but first should come great revolutions and commotions among the nations. He shall come, as the Desire of all nations; desirable to all nations, for in him shall all the earth be blessed with the best of blessings; long expected and desired by all believers. The house they were building should be filled with glory, very far beyond Solomon's temple. This house shall be filled with glory of another nature. If we have silver and gold, we must serve and honour God with it, for the property is his. If we have not silver and gold, we must honour him with such as we have, and he will accept us. Let them be comforted that the glory of this latter house shall be greater than that of the former, in what would be beyond all the glories of the first house, the presence of the Messiah, the Son of God, the Lord of glory, personally, and in human nature. Nothing but the presence of the Son of God, in human form and nature, could fulfil this. Jesus is the Christ, is He that should come, and we are to look for no other. This prophecy alone is enough to silence the Jews, and condemn their obstinate rejection of Him, concerning whom all their prophets spake. If God be with us, peace is with us. But the Jews under the latter temple had much trouble; but this promise is fulfilled in that spiritual peace which Jesus Christ has by his blood purchased for all believers. All changes shall make way for Christ to be desired and valued by all nations. And the Jews shall have their eyes opened to behold how precious He is, whom they have hitherto rejected.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/haggai/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In the seventh month, in the one and twentieth day of the month - This was the seventh day of the feast of tabernacles, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/23-34.htm">Leviticus 23:34</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/23-36.htm">Leviticus 23:36</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/23-40.htm">Leviticus 23:40-42</a>. and its close. The eighth day was to be a sabbath, with its  "holy convocation," but the commemorative feast, the dwelling in booths, in memory of God's bringing them out of Egypt, was to last seven days. The close then of this feast could not but revive their sadness at the glories of their first deliverance by God's "mighly hand and outstretched arm," and their present fewness and poverty. This depression could not but bring with it heavy thoughts about the work, in which they were, in obedience to God, engaged; and that, all the more, since Isaiah and Ezekiel had prophesied of the glories of the Christian Church under the symbol of the temple. This despondency Haggai is sent to relieve, owning plainly the reality of its present grounds, but renewing, on God's part, the pledge of the glories of this second temple, which should be thereafter. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/haggai/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 2<p>Hag 2:1-9.

"And Nineveh like a water-pond all her days. And they flee! Stand ye, O stand! and no one turns round. <a href="/nahum/2-9.htm">Nahum 2:9</a>. Take silver as booty, take ye gold! And no end to the furnishing with immense quantity of all kinds of ornamental vessels. <a href="/nahum/2-10.htm">Nahum 2:10</a>. Emptying and devastation! and the heart has melted, and trembling of the knees, and labour pain in all loins, and the countenance of every one withdraws its ruddiness." Nineveh is compared to a pool, not merely with reference to the multitude of men who had gathered together there, but, as water is everywhere an element of life, also with reference to the wealth and prosperity which accrued to this imperial city out of the streaming together of so many men and so many different peoples. Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-13.htm">Jeremiah 51:13</a>, where Babel is addressed as "Thou that dwellest on many waters, art rich in many treasures." &#1502;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497; &#1492;&#1497;&#1488;, since the days that she exists. &#1492;&#1497;&#1488;  equals  &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1492;&#1497;&#1488;, the relation being indicated by the construct state; &#1502;&#1503; &#1492;&#1493;&#1488; in <a href="/isaiah/18-2.htm">Isaiah 18:2</a> is different. But they flee. The subject to &#1504;&#1505;&#1497;&#1501; is not the waters, although nu&#772;s is applied to water in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/104-7.htm">Psalm 104:7</a>, but, as what follows shows, the masses of men who are represented as water. These flee away without being stopped by the cry "Stand ye" (i.e., remain), or even paying any attention to it. Hiphna&#770;h, lit., "to turn the back" (&#8219;o&#772;reph, <a href="/jeremiah/48-39.htm">Jeremiah 48:39</a>), to flee, but when applied to a person already fleeing, to turn round (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/46-5.htm">Jeremiah 46:5</a>). In <a href="/nahum/2-9.htm">Nahum 2:9</a> the conquerors are summoned to plunder, not by their generals, but by God, who speaks through the prophet. The fact is hereby indicated, "that this does not happen by chance, but because God determines to avenge the injuries inflicted upon His people" (Calvin). With &#1493;&#1488;&#1497;&#1503; &#1511;&#1510;&#1492; the prophecy passes into a simple description. There is no end lattekhu&#772;na&#770;h, to the furnishing with treasures. Tekhu&#772;na&#770;h, from ku&#772;n, not from ta&#770;khan, lit., the setting up, the erection of a building (<a href="/ezekiel/43-11.htm">Ezekiel 43:11</a>); here the furnishing of Nineveh as the dwelling-place of the rulers of the world, whilst in <a href="/job/23-3.htm">Job 23:3</a> it is applied to the place where the throne of God has been established. In &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1491; the &#1500; might be thought of as still continuing in force (Ewald, Hitzig), but it answers better to the liveliness of the description to take &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1491; as beginning a fresh sentence. &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1491; written defectively, as in <a href="/genesis/31-1.htm">Genesis 31:1</a> : glory, equivalent to the great amount of the wealth, as in Genesis (l.c.). Kele&#772; chenda&#770;h, gold and silver vessels and jewels, as in <a href="/hosea/13-15.htm">Hosea 13:15</a>. That there were immense treasures of the precious metals and of costly vessels treasured up in Nineveh, may be inferred with certainty from the accounts of ancient writers, which border on the fabulous.<p>(Note: For proofs, see Layard's Nineveh, ii. 415ff., and Movers, Phnizier (iii. 1, pp. 40, 41). After quoting the statements of Ctesias, the latter observes that "these numbers are indeed fabulous; but they have their historical side, inasmuch as in the time of Ctesias the riches of Nineveh were estimated at an infinitely greater amount than the enormous treasures accumulated in the treasuries of the Persian empire. That the latter is quite in accordance with truth, may be inferred from the fact that the conquerors of Nineveh, the Medes and Chaldaeans, of whose immense booty, in the shape of gold, silver, and other treasures, even the prophet Nahum speaks, furnished Ecbatana and Babylon with gold and silver from the booty of Nineveh to an extent unparalleled in all history.")<p>Of all these treasures nothing was left but desolate emptiness. This is expressed by the combination of three synonymous words. Bu&#772;qa&#770;h and mebhu&#772;qa&#770;h are substantive formations from bu&#772;q  equals  ba&#770;qaq, to empty out, and are combined to strengthen the idea, like similar combinations in <a href="/zephaniah/1-15.htm">Zephaniah 1:15</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-29.htm">Ezekiel 33:29</a>, and <a href="/isaiah/29-2.htm">Isaiah 29:2</a>. Mebhulla&#770;qa&#770;h is a synonymous noun formed from the participle pual, and signifying devastation (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/24-1.htm">Isaiah 24:1</a>, where even ba&#770;laq is combined with ba&#770;qaq). In <a href="/nahum/2-11.htm">Nahum 2:11</a> the horror of the vanquished at the total devastation of Nineveh is described, also in short substantive clauses: "melted heart" (na&#770;me&#772;s is a participle), i.e., perfect despondency (see <a href="/isaiah/13-7.htm">Isaiah 13:7</a>; <a href="/joshua/7-5.htm">Joshua 7:5</a>); trembling of the knees, so that from terror men can hardly keep upon their feet (p&#305;&#772;q for pu&#772;q; it only occurs here). Chalcha&#770;la&#770;h formed by reduplication from ch&#305;&#772;l: spasmodic pains in all loins, like the labour pains of women in childbirth (cf. <a href="/isaiah/21-3.htm">Isaiah 21:3</a>). Lastly, the faces of all turning pale (see at <a href="/joel/2-6.htm">Joel 2:6</a>). </body></html>
