But they could not build such a temple then, as Solomon built. Though our gracious God is pleased if we do as well as we can in his service, yet our proud hearts will scarcely let us be pleased, unless we do as well as others, whose abilities are far beyond ours. Encouragement is given the Jews to go on in the work notwithstanding. They have God with them, his Spirit and his special presence. Though he chastens their transgressions, his faithfulness does not fail. The Spirit still remained among them. And they shall have the Messiah among them shortly; He that should come. Convulsions and changes would take place in the Jewish church and state, but first should come great revolutions and commotions among the nations. He shall come, as the Desire of all nations; desirable to all nations, for in him shall all the earth be blessed with the best of blessings; long expected and desired by all believers. The house they were building should be filled with glory, very far beyond Solomon's temple. This house shall be filled with glory of another nature. If we have silver and gold, we must serve and honour God with it, for the property is his. If we have not silver and gold, we must honour him with such as we have, and he will accept us. Let them be comforted that the glory of this latter house shall be greater than that of the former, in what would be beyond all the glories of the first house, the presence of the Messiah, the Son of God, the Lord of glory, personally, and in human nature. Nothing but the presence of the Son of God, in human form and nature, could fulfil this. Jesus is the Christ, is He that should come, and we are to look for no other. This prophecy alone is enough to silence the Jews, and condemn their obstinate rejection of Him, concerning whom all their prophets spake. If God be with us, peace is with us. But the Jews under the latter temple had much trouble; but this promise is fulfilled in that spiritual peace which Jesus Christ has by his blood purchased for all believers. All changes shall make way for Christ to be desired and valued by all nations. And the Jews shall have their eyes opened to behold how precious He is, whom they have hitherto rejected.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/haggai/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Yet now be strong ... and work - They are the words with which David exhorted Solomon his son to be earnest and to persevere in the building of the first temple <a href="/1_chronicles/28-10.htm">1 Chronicles 28:10</a>. "Take heed now, for the Lord hath chosen thee to build an house for the sanctuary: be strong and do" <a href="/1_chronicles/28-20.htm">1 Chronicles 28:20</a>. "Be strong and of good courage, and do." This combination of words occurs once only elsewhere <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/19-11.htm">2 Chronicles 19:11</a>, in Jehoshaphat's exhortation to "the <a href="/2_chronicles/19-8.htm">2 Chronicles 19:8</a>. Levites and priests and chiefs of the fathers of Israel," whom he had set as judges in Jerusalem. Haggai seems then to have adopted the words, with the purpose of suggesting to the down-hearted people, that there was need of the like exhortation, in view of the building of the former temple, whose relative glory so depressed them. The word "be strong" (elsewhere rendered, "be of good courage") occurs commonly in exhortations to persevere and hold fast, amid whatever obstacles. . <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/haggai/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. be strong &#8230; for I am with you&#8212;The greatest strength is to have Jehovah with us as our strength.

Aben Ezra, Jarchi, Kimchi, and Ben Melech, connect this word with the beginning of the following verse, thus, "and do the word, or thing, which I covenanted with you", &amp;c. <a href="/haggai/2-5.htm">Haggai 2:5</a>; that is, observe the law, and do the commandment then given; but very wrongly: nor is it only to be considered as directed to the people, but to the prince and priest also; for they had all work to do in the house of the Lord, as all ranks and degrees of men now have in the church of Christ; of which that house was typical: the prince or civil magistrate, not to prescribe laws and rules to be observed in it, which only belongs to Christ, who is the sole Head, King, and Lawgiver; but to attend the service of it, to protect and defend it, to promote the interest of it, and distribute cheerfully to the maintenance of its ministers, and to the necessities of the poor saints. Priests or ministers of the word are to work; they are to labour in the word and doctrine; in preaching the Gospel; administering ordinances; governing the church; comforting saints; reproving vice, and refuting error: deacons are to do their work, in taking care of the poor, and minding the secular affairs of the church: and all private Christians are to work, to labour in prayer for the good of it; to hear the word, attend on all ordinances, and hold fast the profession of their faith; all which is to be done in the strength and grace of Christ, without dependence on it, or seeking justification and salvation by it; encouraged, as the Jews are here, with the promise of the divine Presence: <p>for I am with you, saith the Lord of hosts; to help in every service, and to protect from all enemies; and this makes the work and service of the Lord's house pleasant and delightful, and secures from all doubts and fears, faintings and misgivings of heart. This is to be understood of God the Father, the Lord of armies above and below; and if he is for and with his people, they have nothing to fear from those that are against them; or to be discouraged in his service. The Targum wrongly interprets this of the Word of the Lord, since he is meant in the next verse <a href="/haggai/2-5.htm">Haggai 2:5</a>. <p>(e) "et facite", V. L.

"Where is the dwelling of the lions and the feeding-place of the young lions, where the lion walked, the lioness, the lion's whelp, and no one frightened? <a href="/nahum/2-12.htm">Nahum 2:12</a>. The lion robbing for the need of his young ones, and strangling for his lionesses, and he filled his dens with prey, and his dwelling-places with spoil. <a href="/nahum/2-13.htm">Nahum 2:13</a>. Behold, O come to thee, is the saying of Jehovah of hosts, and I cause her chariots to turn in smoke, and thy young lions the sword devours; and I cut off thy prey from the earth, and the voice of thy messengers shall be heard no more." The prophet, beholding the destruction in spirit as having already taken place, looks round for the site on which the mighty city once stood, and sees it no more. This is the meaning of the question in <a href="/nahum/2-11.htm">Nahum 2:11</a>. He describes it as the dwelling-place of lions. The point of comparison is the predatory lust of its rulers and their warriors, who crushed the nations like lions, plundering their treasures, and bringing them together in Nineveh. To fill up the picture, the epithets applied to the lions are grouped together according to the difference of sex and age. &#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492; is the full-grown male lion; &#1500;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488;, the lioness; &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1497;&#1512;, the young lion, though old enough to go in search of prey; &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; &#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492;, catulus leonis, the lion's whelp, which cannot yet seek prey for itself. &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492; &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;, lit., "and a feeding-place is it," sc. the dwelling-place (&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; pointing back to &#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1503;) in this sense: "Where is the dwelling-place which was also a feeding-place for the young lions?" By the apposition the thought is expressed, that the city of lions was not only a resting-place, but also afforded a comfortable living. &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; is to be taken in connection with the following &#1513;&#1473;&#1501;: in the very place where; and ha&#770;lakh signifies simply to walk, to walk about, not "to take exercise," in which case the kal would stand for piel. The more precise definition follows in &#1493;&#1488;&#1497;&#1503; &#1502;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1491;, without any one terrifying, hence in perfect rest and security, and undisturbed might (cf. <a href="/micah/4-4.htm">Micah 4:4</a>; <a href="/leviticus/26-6.htm">Leviticus 26:6</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-26.htm">Deuteronomy 28:26</a>, etc.). Under the same figure <a href="/nahum/2-12.htm">Nahum 2:12</a> describes the tyranny and predatory lust of the Assyrians in their wars. This description is subordinate in sense to the leading thought, or to the question contained in the previous verse. Where is the city now, into which the Assyrians swept together the booty of the peoples and kingdoms which they had destroyed? In form, however, the verse is attached poetically in loose apposition to <a href="/nahum/2-12.htm">Nahum 2:12</a>. The lion, as king of the beasts, is a very fitting emblem of the kings or rulers of Assyria. The lionesses and young lions are the citizens of Nineveh and of the province of Assyria, the tribe-land of the imperial monarchy of Assyria, and not the queens and princes, as the Chaldee explains it. Go&#772;ro&#772;th with the o-inflection for gu&#772;ro&#772;th, as in <a href="/jeremiah/51-38.htm">Jeremiah 51:38</a>. Cho&#772;r&#305;&#772;m, holes for hiding-places, or caves, not only applies to the robbers, in which character the Assyrians are exhibited through the figure of the lion (Hitzig), but also to the lions, which carry their prey into caves (cf. Bochart, Hieroz. i. 737). This destruction of Nineveh will assuredly take place; for Jehovah the Almighty God has proclaimed it, and He will fulfil His word. The word of God in <a href="/nahum/2-13.htm">Nahum 2:13</a> stamps the foregoing threat with the seal of confirmation. &#1492;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497; &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498;, behold I((will) to thee (Nineveh). We have not to supply &#1488;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488; here, but simply the verb. copul., which is always omitted in such sentences. The relation of the subject to the object is expressed by &#1488;&#1500; (cf. <a href="/nahum/3-5.htm">Nahum 3:5</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/51-25.htm">Jeremiah 51:25</a>). &#1492;&#1489;&#1506;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; &#1489;&#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1503;, I burn into smoke, i.e., so that it vanishes into smoke (cf. <a href="/psalms/37-20.htm">Psalm 37:20</a>). &#1512;&#1499;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468;, her war-chariots, stands synecdochically for the whole of the apparatus of war (Calvin). The suffix in the third person must not be altered; it may easily be explained from the poetical variation of prophetic announcement and direct address. The young lions are the warriors; the echo of the figure in the previous verse still lingers in this figure, as well as in &#1496;&#1512;&#1508;&#1468;&#1498;. The last clause expresses the complete destruction of the imperial might of Assyria. The messengers of Nineveh are partly heralds, as the carriers of the king's commands; partly halberdiers, or delegates who fulfilled the ruler's commands (cf. <a href="/1_kings/19-2.htm">1 Kings 19:2</a>; <a href="/2_kings/19-23.htm">2 Kings 19:23</a>). The suffix in &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1499;&#1499;&#1492; is in a lengthened form, on account of the tone at the end of the section, analogous to &#1488;&#1514;&#1499;&#1492; in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/29-35.htm">Exodus 29:35</a>, and is not to be regarded as an Aramaeism or a dialectical variation (Ewald, 258, a). The tsere of the last syllable is occasioned by the previous tsere. Jerome has summed up the meaning very well as follows: "Thou wilt never lay countries waste any more, nor exact tribute, nor will thy messengers be heard throughout thy provinces." (On the last clause, see <a href="/ezekiel/19-9.htm">Ezekiel 19:9</a>.)  </body></html>
