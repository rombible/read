The sum of these two rules of the law is, that sin is more easily learned from others than holiness. The impurity of their hearts and lives shall make the work of their hands, and all their offerings, unclean before God. The case is the same with us. When employed in any good work, we should watch over ourselves, lest we render it unclean by our corruptions. When we begin to make conscience of duty to God, we may expect his blessing; and whoso is wise will understand the loving-kindness of the Lord. God will curse the blessings of the wicked, and make bitter the prosperity of the careless; but he will sweeten the cup of affliction to those who diligently serve him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/haggai/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Ask now the priests concerning the law - The priests answer rightly, that, by the law, insulated unholiness spread further than insulated holiness. The flesh of the sacrifice hallowed whatever it should touch,  but not further; but the human being, who was defiled by touching a dead body, defiled all he might touch <a href="/numbers/19-22.htm">Numbers 19:22</a>. Haggai does not apply the first part; namely, that the worship on the altar which they reared, while they neglected the building of the temple, did not hallow. The possession of a truly tiring does not counterbalance disobedience. Contrariwise, one defilement defiled the whole man and all which he touched, according to that <a href="//biblehub.com/james/2-10.htm">James 2:10</a>, "whosoever shall keep the whole law and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all."<p>In the application, the two melt into one, for the holy thing, namely, the altar which they raised out of fear on their return, so far from hallowing the land or people by the sacrifices offered thereon, was itself defiled. "This people" and "this nation" (not "My people") since they in act disowned Him. "Whatever they offer there," i. e., on that altar, instead of the temple which God commanded, is unclean, offending Him who gave all. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/haggai/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11.

"Behold, I come to thee, is the saying of Jehovah of hosts; and uncover thy skirts over thy face, and let nations see they nakedness, and kingdoms thy shame. <a href="/nahum/3-6.htm">Nahum 3:6</a>. And cast horrible things upon thee, and shame thee, and make thee a gazing-stock. <a href="/nahum/3-7.htm">Nahum 3:7</a>. And it comes to pass, every one who sees thee will flee before thee, and say, Is Nineveh laid waste? Who will bewail her? whence do I seek comforters for thee?" <a href="/nahum/3-5.htm">Nahum 3:5</a>.a as in <a href="/nahum/2-13.htm">Nahum 2:13</a>. The punishment of Nineveh will correspond to her conduct. Her coquetry shall be repaid to her by the uncovering of her nakedness before the nations (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/13-26.htm">Jeremiah 13:26</a>; <a href="/isaiah/47-3.htm">Isaiah 47:3</a>; <a href="/hosea/2-5.htm">Hosea 2:5</a>). Gilla&#770;h, to uncover. Shu&#772;l&#305;&#772;m, fimbriae, the skirts, borders, or lower end of the long sweeping dress (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/28-33.htm">Exodus 28:33-34</a>; <a href="/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1</a>). &#1506;&#1500; &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1498;, over thy countenance, so that the train when lifted up is drawn over the face. &#1502;&#1506;&#1512;, a contraction of &#1502;&#1506;&#1512;&#1492;, from &#1506;&#1512;&#1492;, signifies in <a href="/1_kings/7-36.htm">1 Kings 7:36</a> an empty space, here nakedness or shame equivalent to &#1506;&#1512;&#1493;&#1492;. This thought is carried out still further in literal terms in <a href="//biblehub.com/nahum/3-6.htm">Nahum 3:6</a>, <a href="/nahum/3-7.htm">Nahum 3:7</a>. Shiqquts&#305;&#772;m, objects of abhorrence, is used most frequently of idols; but here it is used in a more general sense for unclean or repulsive things, dirt and filth. Throwing dirt upon any one is a figurative expression for the most ignominious treatment or greatest contempt. Nibbe&#772;l, to treat contemptuously, not with words, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/7-6.htm">Micah 7:6</a>, but with deeds, equivalent to insult or abuse (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/14-21.htm">Jeremiah 14:21</a>). To make it &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1497;, the object of sight, i.e., to give up to open shame, &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; (<a href="/matthew/1-19.htm">Matthew 1:19</a>). &#1512;&#1488;&#1497;, a pausal form of &#1512;&#1488;&#1497;, the seeing, here the spectacle, like &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; in <a href="/1_corinthians/4-9.htm">1 Corinthians 4:9</a>. This is evident from <a href="//biblehub.com/nahum/3-7.htm">Nahum 3:7</a>, where &#1512;&#1488;&#1497;&#1498; contains a play upon &#1512;&#1488;&#1497;. Every one who looks at her will flee from her as an object of disgust. &#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1468;&#1491;&#1492;, a rare form of the pual for &#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1468;&#1491;&#1492; (for the fact, compare <a href="/jeremiah/48-20.htm">Jeremiah 48:20</a>). The last two clauses express the thought that no one will take pity upon the devastated city, because its fate is so well deserved; compare <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/51-19.htm">Isaiah 51:19</a>, where the same words are used of Jerusalem. Nineveh will not be able to protect herself from destruction even by her great power. The prophet wrests this vain hope away from her by pointing in <a href="/isaiah/51-8.htm">Isaiah 51:8</a>. to the fall of the mighty Thebes in Egypt. </body></html>
