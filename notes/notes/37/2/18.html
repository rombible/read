The work of building had been carried on intermittently till within two years of the present time. It had then been entirely suspended, and had only been actively taken in hand after Haggai’s address in the sixth month of this year. The force of the passage is sufficiently plain if we render as above. “In order to make the blessings to be announced in <a href="/haggai/2-19.htm" title="Is the seed yet in the barn? yes, as yet the vine, and the fig tree, and the pomegranate, and the olive tree, has not brought forth: from this day will I bless you.">Haggai 2:19</a> appear in strong contrast to the distress pictured in <a href="/context/haggai/2-16.htm" title="Since those days were, when one came to an heap of twenty measures, there were but ten: when one came to the fat press for to draw out fifty vessels out of the press, there were but twenty.">Haggai 2:16-17</a>, the prophet repeats the injunction of <a href="/haggai/2-15.htm" title="And now, I pray you, consider from this day and upward, from before a stone was laid on a stone in the temple of the LORD:">Haggai 2:15</a>, but with a larger range of retrospect. The whole period back to the time when the foundation of the Temple was laid in the reign of Cyrus was more or less one of distress on account of the unfaithfulness of the people; for between that time and the present all the efforts that had been made to complete the work were spasmodic and feeble” (McCurdy).

The sum of these two rules of the law is, that sin is more easily learned from others than holiness. The impurity of their hearts and lives shall make the work of their hands, and all their offerings, unclean before God. The case is the same with us. When employed in any good work, we should watch over ourselves, lest we render it unclean by our corruptions. When we begin to make conscience of duty to God, we may expect his blessing; and whoso is wise will understand the loving-kindness of the Lord. God will curse the blessings of the wicked, and make bitter the prosperity of the careless; but he will sweeten the cup of affliction to those who diligently serve him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/haggai/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>From the day that the foundation of the Lord's house - Zechariah, in a passage corresponding to this, uses the same words <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/8-9.htm">Zechariah 8:9</a>, "the day that the foundation of the house of the Lord of hosts was laid, that the temple might be built," not of the first foundation, but of the work as resumed in obedience to the words by "the mouth of the prophets," Haggai and himself, which, Ezra also says, was <a href="/ezra/4-24.htm">Ezra 4:24</a>; <a href="/ezra/5-1.htm">Ezra 5:1</a>. "in the second year of Darius." But that work was resumed, not now at the time of this prophecy, but three months before, on the 24th of the sixth month. Since then the word translated here, from,  is in no case used of the present time, Haggai gives two dates, the resumption of the work, as marked in these words, and the, actual present. He would then say, that even in these last months, since they had begun the work, there were as yet no signs for the better. There was yet no "seed in the barn," the harvest having been blighted and the fruit-trees stripped by the hail before the close of the sixth month, when they resumed the work. Yet though there were as yet no signs of change, no earnest that the promise should be fulfilled, God pledges His word, "from this day I will bless you."<p>Thenceforth, from their obedience, God would give them those fruits of the earth, which in His Providence had been, during their negligence, withheld. "God," said Paul and Barnabas, <a href="/acts/14-17.htm">Acts 14:17</a>. "left not Himself without witness, in that He did good, and gave us rain from heaven and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness."<p>All the Old and New Testament, the Law, the prophets and the Psalms, the Apostles and our Lord Himself, bear witness to the Providence of God who makes His natural laws serve to the moral discipline of His creature, man. The physical theory, which presupposes that God so fixed the laws of His creation, as to leave no room for Himself to vary them, would, if ever so true, only come to this, that Almighty God knowing absolutely (as He must know) the actions of His creatures (in what way soever this is reconcilable with our free-agency, of which we are conscious), framed the laws of His physical creation, so that plenty or famine, healthiness of our cattle or of the fruits of the earth or their sickness, should coincide with the good or evil conduct of man, with his prayers or his neglect of prayer. The reward or chastisement alike come to man, whether they be theresult of God's will, acting apart from any system which He has created, or in it and through it.<p>It is alike His Providential agency, whether He have established any such system with all its minute variations, or whether these variations are the immediate result of His sovereign will. If He has instituted any physical system, so that the rain, hail, and its proportions, size, destructiveness, should come in a regulated irregularity, as fixed in all eternity as the revolutions of the heavenly bodies or the courses of the comets, then we come only to a more intricate perfection of His creation, that in all eternity He framed those laws in an exact conformity to the perfectly foreseen actions of men good and evil, and to their prayers also: that He, knowing certainly whether the creature, which He has framed to have its bliss in depending on Him, would or would not cry unto Him, framed those physical laws in conformity therewith; so that the supply of what is necessary for our wants or its withholding shall be in all time inworked into the system of our probation. Only, not to keep God out of His own world, we must remember that other truth, that, whether God act in any such system or no, He <a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>. "upholdeth all things by the word of His power" by an everpresent working; so that it is He who at each moment doth what is done, doth and maintains in existence all which He has created in the exact order and variations of their being. <a href="/psalms/148-8.htm">Psalm 148:8</a>. "Fire and hail, snow and vapor, stormy wind fulfilling His word," are as immediate results of His Divine Agency, in whatever way it pleaseth Him to act, and are the expression of His will. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/haggai/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18.

Or, translate, "From this day on which the temple is being begun," namely, on the foundations long ago laid [Grotius].

It is first described as, <span class="ital">from this day and upward, or backward</span>. Then each limit of the period is more clearly defined. “This day” is “the four and twentieth day of the ninth month,” on which this prophecy was uttered, ver. 10. The “upward” or “backward” extends to the other limit from which the reckoning is to be made, viz. “the day that the foundation of the Lord’s temple was laid,” i.e. the day when the actual foundation was completed in the year after their return from Babylon. This is made clearer in R. V. by the substitution of, <span class="ital">since the day</span>, for <span class="ital">even from the day</span>. This period they are again called upon to “consider,” and to note well the dark cloud of adversity that brooded over it.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/haggai/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 18, 19.</span> - &sect; 2. <span class="accented">On their obedience the blessings of nature shall again be theirs.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Consider now from this day and upward</span> (see note on ver. 15.) For "upward" Jerome has here <span class="accented">in futurum</span>, though he translated the same word <span class="accented">supra</span> in ver. 15. Such a rendering is allowable, and affords a good sense, the prophet directing the people's attention to the happy prospect in the future announced in ver. 19. But it seems, best to keep to the same interpretation in two passages so closely allied. The prophet bids the people consider the period from the present, <span class="cmt_word">the four and twentieth day of the ninth month</span>, when this prophecy was uttered (ver. 10), to the other limit explanatory of the term "upward" or "backward." <span class="cmt_word">Even from the day that the foundation,</span> etc.; rather, <span class="accented">since the day that</span>, etc. This is obviously the same period as that named in ver. 15, after the foundation was completed, but before "stone was laid upon stone" of the superstructure (comp. <a href="/zechariah/8-9.htm">Zechariah 8:9</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/nahum/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The same, or rather a worse fate than No-amon suffered, is now awaiting Nineveh. <a href="/nahum/3-11.htm">Nahum 3:11</a>.

All thy citadels are fig-trees with early figs; if they are shaken, they fall into the mouth of the eater. <a href="/nahum/3-13.htm">Nahum 3:13</a>.

"The fate of No-amon is a prophecy of thine own" (Hitzig). &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;, thou wilt be drunken, viz., from the goblet of divine wrath, as at <a href="/obadiah/1-16.htm">Obadiah 1:16</a>. &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1497; &#1504;&#1506;&#1500;&#1502;&#1492; might mean, "thou wilt be hiding thyself;" but although this might suit what follows, it does not agree with  &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497; ,  since an intoxicated person is not in the habit of hiding himself. Moreover, &#1504;&#1506;&#1500;&#1501; always means "hidden," occultus; so that Calvin's interpretation is the correct one: "Thou wilt vanish away as if thou hadst never been; the Hebrews frequently using the expression being hidden for being reduced to nothing." This is favoured by a comparison both with <a href="/nahum/1-8.htm">Nahum 1:8</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/nahum/2-12.htm">Nahum 2:12</a>, and also with the parallel passage in <a href="//biblehub.com/obadiah/1-16.htm">Obadiah 1:16</a>, "They will drink, and be as if they had not been." This is carried out still further in what follows: "Thou wilt seek refuge from the enemy," i.e., in this connection, seek it in vain, or without finding it; not, "Thou wilt surely demand salvation from the enemy by surrender" (Strauss), for &#1502;&#1488;&#1493;&#1497;&#1489; does not belong to &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;, but to &#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1494; (cf. <a href="/isaiah/25-4.htm">Isaiah 25:4</a>). All the fortifications of Nineveh are like fig-trees with early figs (&#1506;&#1501; in the sense of subordination, as in Sol 4:13), which fall into the mouth of the eater when the trees are shaken. The tertium compar. is the facility with which the castles will be taken and destroyed by the enemy assaulting them (cf. <a href="/isaiah/28-4.htm">Isaiah 28:4</a>). We must not extend the comparison so far, however, as to take the figs as representing cowardly warriors, as Hitzig does. Even in <a href="//biblehub.com/nahum/3-13.htm">Nahum 3:13</a>, where the people are compared to women, the point of comparison is not the cowardliness of the warriors, but the weakness and inability to offer any successful resistance into which the nation of the Assyrians, which was at other times so warlike, would be reduced through the force of the divine judgment inflicted upon Nineveh (compare <a href="/isaiah/19-16.htm">Isaiah 19:16</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/50-37.htm">Jeremiah 50:37</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/51-30.htm">Jeremiah 51:30</a>). &#1500;&#1488;&#1497;&#1489;&#1497;&#1498; belongs to what follows, and is placed first, and pointed with zakeph-katon for the sake of emphasis. The gates of the land are the approaches to it, the passes leading into it, which were no doubt provided with castles. Tuch (p. 35) refers to the mountains on the north, which Pliny calls impassable. The bolts of these gates are the castles, through which the approaches were closed. Jeremiah transfers to Babel what is here said of Nineveh (see <a href="/jeremiah/51-30.htm">Jeremiah 51:30</a>). </body></html>
