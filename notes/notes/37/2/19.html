The sum of these two rules of the law is, that sin is more easily learned from others than holiness. The impurity of their hearts and lives shall make the work of their hands, and all their offerings, unclean before God. The case is the same with us. When employed in any good work, we should watch over ourselves, lest we render it unclean by our corruptions. When we begin to make conscience of duty to God, we may expect his blessing; and whoso is wise will understand the loving-kindness of the Lord. God will curse the blessings of the wicked, and make bitter the prosperity of the careless; but he will sweeten the cup of affliction to those who diligently serve him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/haggai/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>From the day that the foundation of the Lord's house - Zechariah, in a passage corresponding to this, uses the same words <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/8-9.htm">Zechariah 8:9</a>, "the day that the foundation of the house of the Lord of hosts was laid, that the temple might be built," not of the first foundation, but of the work as resumed in obedience to the words by "the mouth of the prophets," Haggai and himself, which, Ezra also says, was <a href="/ezra/4-24.htm">Ezra 4:24</a>; <a href="/ezra/5-1.htm">Ezra 5:1</a>. "in the second year of Darius." But that work was resumed, not now at the time of this prophecy, but three months before, on the 24th of the sixth month. Since then the word translated here, from,  is in no case used of the present time, Haggai gives two dates, the resumption of the work, as marked in these words, and the, actual present. He would then say, that even in these last months, since they had begun the work, there were as yet no signs for the better. There was yet no "seed in the barn," the harvest having been blighted and the fruit-trees stripped by the hail before the close of the sixth month, when they resumed the work. Yet though there were as yet no signs of change, no earnest that the promise should be fulfilled, God pledges His word, "from this day I will bless you."<p>Thenceforth, from their obedience, God would give them those fruits of the earth, which in His Providence had been, during their negligence, withheld. "God," said Paul and Barnabas, <a href="/acts/14-17.htm">Acts 14:17</a>. "left not Himself without witness, in that He did good, and gave us rain from heaven and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness."<p>All the Old and New Testament, the Law, the prophets and the Psalms, the Apostles and our Lord Himself, bear witness to the Providence of God who makes His natural laws serve to the moral discipline of His creature, man. The physical theory, which presupposes that God so fixed the laws of His creation, as to leave no room for Himself to vary them, would, if ever so true, only come to this, that Almighty God knowing absolutely (as He must know) the actions of His creatures (in what way soever this is reconcilable with our free-agency, of which we are conscious), framed the laws of His physical creation, so that plenty or famine, healthiness of our cattle or of the fruits of the earth or their sickness, should coincide with the good or evil conduct of man, with his prayers or his neglect of prayer. The reward or chastisement alike come to man, whether they be theresult of God's will, acting apart from any system which He has created, or in it and through it.<p>It is alike His Providential agency, whether He have established any such system with all its minute variations, or whether these variations are the immediate result of His sovereign will. If He has instituted any physical system, so that the rain, hail, and its proportions, size, destructiveness, should come in a regulated irregularity, as fixed in all eternity as the revolutions of the heavenly bodies or the courses of the comets, then we come only to a more intricate perfection of His creation, that in all eternity He framed those laws in an exact conformity to the perfectly foreseen actions of men good and evil, and to their prayers also: that He, knowing certainly whether the creature, which He has framed to have its bliss in depending on Him, would or would not cry unto Him, framed those physical laws in conformity therewith; so that the supply of what is necessary for our wants or its withholding shall be in all time inworked into the system of our probation. Only, not to keep God out of His own world, we must remember that other truth, that, whether God act in any such system or no, He <a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>. "upholdeth all things by the word of His power" by an everpresent working; so that it is He who at each moment doth what is done, doth and maintains in existence all which He has created in the exact order and variations of their being. <a href="/psalms/148-8.htm">Psalm 148:8</a>. "Fire and hail, snow and vapor, stormy wind fulfilling His word," are as immediate results of His Divine Agency, in whatever way it pleaseth Him to act, and are the expression of His will. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/haggai/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19.

It has been already sown this month, and there are no more signs of its bearing a good crop, much less of its being safely stored in the barn, than there were in the past season, when there was such a failure; yet I promise to you from this day (emphatically marking by the repetition the connection of the blessing with the day of their obedience) a blessing in an abundant harvest. So also the vine, &c., which heretofore have borne little or nothing, shall be blessed with productiveness. Thus it will be made evident that the blessing is due to Me, not to nature.

Nor have your fruit trees yet put forth, no sign yet appears what vintage you shall have, what store of wine, oil, figs, and pomegranates, which are your choice and rich fruits; but in the word of God I tell you, you shall be blessed in them all, and have a large produce, a joyful vintage. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">From this day:</span> see <span class="bld"><a href="/haggai/2-10.htm" title="In the four and twentieth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet, saying,">Haggai 2:10</a>,15</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I will bless you, </span> in all your labour; as before you were blasted in all because you neglected, so now you shall be blessed in all because you diligently build, the temple of the Lord. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/haggai/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Is the seed yet in the barn?....

Kimchi observes, that it may be wondered at that the olive tree should be mentioned, because the time of its bearing fruit were the months of Marchesvan and Chisleu; but perhaps the time of its bearing fruit was delayed (as he says) because of the curse upon it: <p>from this day will I bless you; with plenty of all good things, in their fields and gardens, in their vineyards and olive yards; so that a difference between former and present times, and those to come, would easily be discerned, and the reasons of it. <p>(r) T.

Is it not all exhausted and used up? The meagre yield of the blighted corn was soon consumed and the granary left empty. Some have thought that by “the seed” is here meant what would be required to sow the land for another year, and that the dearth and distress are heightened by the fact that there is not even corn enough left to sow. But as the word is frequently used, not of seed corn, but of produce (e.g. <a href="/1_samuel/8-15.htm" title="And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants.">1 Samuel 8:15</a>; <a href="/isaiah/23-3.htm" title="And by great waters the seed of Sihor, the harvest of the river, is her revenue; and she is a mart of nations.">Isaiah 23:3</a>; <a href="/job/39-12.htm" title="Will you believe him, that he will bring home your seed, and gather it into your barn?">Job 39:12</a>), and as the remainder of the verse refers to produce, it is better taken in that sense here.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">yea, as yet</span>] There is no reason to depart from the usual meaning of the Hebrew word here rendered “as yet,” viz. “unto,” or “as regards,” “And unto or as regards (extending our notice from the corn to) the vine, etc. it (i.e. each one of these trees) hath not brought forth (fruit).” It would then best accord with the English idiom to leave the word untranslated, as in R. V. The rendering of A. V. is however thought by some to be supported by <a href="/job/1-18.htm" title="While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother's house:">Job 1:18</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/14-19.htm" title="And it came to pass, while Saul talked to the priest, that the noise that was in the host of the Philistines went on and increased: and Saul said to the priest, Withdraw your hand.">1 Samuel 14:19</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">from this day will I bless you</span>] It might be asked, why not from the day three months earlier than this (ch. <a href="/context/haggai/1-14.htm" title="And the LORD stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people; and they came and did work in the house of the LORD of hosts, their God,...">Haggai 1:14-15</a>), when they first resumed the building of the temple? It has been suggested in explanation that up to this time, though they had indeed begun again to build, they had been slack and remiss in their efforts, but that from this day, instigated by this fresh appeal of Haggai, they had taken a new departure of zeal and earnestness, and that consequently from this day the blessing was to begin. But there is no proof whatever that this was so, and it is therefore better to suppose that up to this day the effects of the failure of the last harvest were still apparent, and no outward change had yet taken place in their prospects. “He would then say, that even in these last months, since they had begun the work, there were as yet no signs for the better.

From this day will I bless you. "This day" is the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month (ver. 10). From now the improvement in the season should begin and make itself evident.

Moreover, &#1504;&#1506;&#1500;&#1501; always means "hidden," occultus; so that Calvin's interpretation is the correct one: "Thou wilt vanish away as if thou hadst never been; the Hebrews frequently using the expression being hidden for being reduced to nothing." This is favoured by a comparison both with <a href="/nahum/1-8.htm">Nahum 1:8</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/nahum/2-12.htm">Nahum 2:12</a>, and also with the parallel passage in <a href="//biblehub.com/obadiah/1-16.htm">Obadiah 1:16</a>, "They will drink, and be as if they had not been." This is carried out still further in what follows: "Thou wilt seek refuge from the enemy," i.e., in this connection, seek it in vain, or without finding it; not, "Thou wilt surely demand salvation from the enemy by surrender" (Strauss), for &#1502;&#1488;&#1493;&#1497;&#1489; does not belong to &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;, but to &#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1494; (cf. <a href="/isaiah/25-4.htm">Isaiah 25:4</a>). All the fortifications of Nineveh are like fig-trees with early figs (&#1506;&#1501; in the sense of subordination, as in Sol 4:13), which fall into the mouth of the eater when the trees are shaken. The tertium compar. is the facility with which the castles will be taken and destroyed by the enemy assaulting them (cf. <a href="/isaiah/28-4.htm">Isaiah 28:4</a>). We must not extend the comparison so far, however, as to take the figs as representing cowardly warriors, as Hitzig does. Even in <a href="//biblehub.com/nahum/3-13.htm">Nahum 3:13</a>, where the people are compared to women, the point of comparison is not the cowardliness of the warriors, but the weakness and inability to offer any successful resistance into which the nation of the Assyrians, which was at other times so warlike, would be reduced through the force of the divine judgment inflicted upon Nineveh (compare <a href="/isaiah/19-16.htm">Isaiah 19:16</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/50-37.htm">Jeremiah 50:37</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/51-30.htm">Jeremiah 51:30</a>). &#1500;&#1488;&#1497;&#1489;&#1497;&#1498; belongs to what follows, and is placed first, and pointed with zakeph-katon for the sake of emphasis. The gates of the land are the approaches to it, the passes leading into it, which were no doubt provided with castles. Tuch (p. 35) refers to the mountains on the north, which Pliny calls impassable. The bolts of these gates are the castles, through which the approaches were closed. Jeremiah transfers to Babel what is here said of Nineveh (see <a href="/jeremiah/51-30.htm">Jeremiah 51:30</a>). </body></html>
