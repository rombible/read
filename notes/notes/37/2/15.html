The sum of these two rules of the law is, that sin is more easily learned from others than holiness. The impurity of their hearts and lives shall make the work of their hands, and all their offerings, unclean before God. The case is the same with us. When employed in any good work, we should watch over ourselves, lest we render it unclean by our corruptions. When we begin to make conscience of duty to God, we may expect his blessing; and whoso is wise will understand the loving-kindness of the Lord.

The precise measure is not mentioned:  the force of the appeal lay in the proportion: the heap of grain which, usually, would yield twenty, (whether bushels  or seahs  or any other measure, for the heap itself being of no defined size, neither could the quantity expected from it be defined) there were ten only; "one came to the pressvat to draw out fifty" vessels out of the press, or perhaps fifty poorah, i. e., the ordinary quantity drawn out at one time from the press,  there were, or it bad become twenty, two-fifths only of what they looked for and ordinarily obtained.

The great moral lesson of the Book is again inculcated.

Let them lay to heart the fact that it had been throughout a period of distress and dearth, of gloom and darkness.

Inschr. i. p. 177). The Greeks called it &#x394;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, generally with the predicate &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b7; (Diod. Sic. i. 45), or from the profane name of the city, which was Apet according to Brugsch (possibly a throne, seat, or bank), and with the feminine article prefixed, Tapet, or Tape, or Tepe, &#x398;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;, generally used in the plural &#x398;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;. This strong royal city, which was described even by Homer (Il. ix. 383) as &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, and in which the Pharaohs of the 18th to the 20th dynasties, from Amosis to the last Rameses, resided, and created those works of architecture which were admired by Greeks and Romans, and the remains of which still fill the visitor with astonishment, was situated on both banks of the river Nile, which was 1500 feet in breadth at that point, and was built upon a broad plain formed by the falling back of the Libyan and Arabian mountain wall, over which there are now scattered nine larger or smaller fellah-villages, including upon the eastern bank Karnak and Luxor, and upon the western Gurnah and Medinet Abu, with their plantations of date-palms, sugar-canes, corn, etc. &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, who sits there, i.e., dwells quietly and securely, on the streams of the Nile. The plural &#1497;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; refers to the Nile with its canals, which surrounded the city, as we may see from what follows: "water round about her." &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1470;&#1495;&#1497;&#1500;, not which is a fortress of the sea (Hitzig), but whose bulwark is sea. &#1495;&#1497;&#1500; (for &#1495;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492;&#1468;) does not mean the fortified place (Hitzig), but the fortification, bulwark, applied primarily to the moats of a fortification, with the wall belonging to it; then, in the broader sense, the defence of a city in distinction from the actual wall (cf. <a href="/isaiah/26-1.htm">Isaiah 26:1</a>; <a href="/lamentations/2-8.htm">Lamentations 2:8</a>). &#1502;&#1497;&#1468;&#1501;, consisting of sea is its wall, i.e., its wall is formed of sea. Great rivers are frequently called ya&#770;m, sea, in rhetorical and poetical diction: for example, the Euphrates in <a href="/isaiah/27-1.htm">Isaiah 27:1</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/51-36.htm">Jeremiah 51:36</a>; and the Nile in <a href="/isaiah/18-2.htm">Isaiah 18:2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/19-5.htm">Isaiah 19:5</a>; <a href="/job/41-23.htm">Job 41:23</a>. The Nile is still called by the Beduins bahr, i.e., sea, and when it overflows it really resembles a sea.<p>To the natural strength of Thebes there was also added the strength of the warlike nations at her command. Cush, i.e., Ethiopians in the stricter sense, and Mitsraim, Egyptians, the two tribes descended from Ham, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/10-6.htm">Genesis 10:6</a>, who formed the Egyptian kingdom before the fall of Thebes, and under the 25th (Ethiopian) dynasty. &#1506;&#1510;&#1502;&#1492;, as in <a href="/isaiah/40-29.htm">Isaiah 40:29</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/47-9.htm">Isaiah 47:9</a>, for &#1506;&#1510;&#1501;, strength; it is written without any suffix, which may easily be supplied from the context. The corresponding words to &#1506;&#1510;&#1502;&#1492; in the parallel clause are &#1493;&#1488;&#1497;&#1503; &#1511;&#1510;&#1492; (with Vav cop.): Egyptians, as for them there is no number; equivalent to an innumerable multitude. To these there were to be added the auxiliary tribes: Put, i.e., the Libyans in the broader sense, who had spread themselves out over the northern part of Africa as far as Mauritania (see at <a href="/genesis/10-6.htm">Genesis 10:6</a>); and Lubim  equals  Leha&#770;bh&#305;&#772;m, the Libyans in the narrower sense, probably the Libyaegyptii of the ancients (see at <a href="/genesis/10-13.htm">Genesis 10:13</a>). &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1494;&#1512;&#1514;&#1498; (cf. <a href="/psalms/35-2.htm">Psalm 35:2</a>) Nahum addresses No-amon itself, to give greater life to the description. Notwithstanding all this might, No-amon had to wander into captivity. Laggo&#772;la&#770;h and basshebh&#305;&#772; are not tautological. Laggo&#772;la&#770;h, for emigration, is strengthened by basshebh&#305;&#772; into captivity. The perfect &#1492;&#1500;&#1499;&#1492; is obviously not to be taken prophetically. The very antithesis of &#1490;&#1468;&#1501;&#1470;&#1492;&#1497;&#1488; &#1492;&#1500;&#1499;&#1492; and &#1490;&#1468;&#1501;&#1470;&#1488;&#1514;&#1468; &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497; (<a href="/nahum/3-11.htm">Nahum 3:11</a>) shows to itself that &#1492;&#1500;&#1499;&#1492; refers to the past, as &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497; does to the future; yea, the facts themselves require that Nahum should be understood as pointing to the fate which the powerful city of Thebes had already experienced. For it must be an event that has already occurred, and not something still in the future, which he holds up before Nineveh as a mirror of the fate that is awaiting it. The clauses which follow depict the cruelties that were generally associated with the taking of an enemy's cities. For &#1506;&#1500;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; roF .se, see <a href="/hosea/14-1.htm">Hosea 14:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/13-16.htm">Isaiah 13:16</a>, and <a href="/2_kings/8-12.htm">2 Kings 8:12</a>; and for &#1497;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; &#1490;&#1493;&#1512;&#1500;, <a href="/joel/3-3.htm">Joel 3:3</a> and <a href="/obadiah/1-11.htm">Obadiah 1:11</a>.

It must be borne in mind, however, that the words only refer to cruelties connected with the conquest and carrying away of the inhabitants, and not to the destruction of No-amon.<p>We have no express historical account of this occurrence; but there is hardly any doubt that, after the conquest of Ashdod, Sargon the king of Assyria organized an expedition against Egypt and Ethiopia, conquered No-amon, the residence of the Pharaohs at that time, and, as Isaiah prophesied (<a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/20-3.htm">Isaiah 20:3-4</a>), carried the prisoners of Egypt and Ethiopia into exile. According to the Assyrian researches and their most recent results (vid., Spiegel's Nineveh and Assyria in Herzog's Cyclopaedia), the king Sargon mentioned in <a href="/isaiah/20-1.htm">Isaiah 20:1</a> is not the same person as Shalmaneser, as I assumed in my commentary on <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/17-3.htm">2 Kings 17:3</a>, but his successor, and the predecessor of Sennacherib, who ascended the throne during the siege of Samaria, and conquered that city in the first year of his reign, leading 27,280 persons into captivity, and appointing a vicegerent over the country of the ten tribes. In Assyrian Sargon is called Sar Kin, i.e., essentially a king. He was the builder of the palace at Khorsabad, which is so rich in monuments; and, according to the inscriptions, he carried on wars in Susiana, Babylon, the borders of Egypt, Melitene, Southern Armenia, Kurdistan, and Media; and in all his expeditions he resorted to the removal of the people in great numbers, as one means of securing the lasting subjugation of the lands (see Spiegel, l.c. p. 224). In the great inscription in the palace-halls of Khorsabad, Sargon boasts immediately after the conquest of Samaria of a victorious conflict with Pharaoh Sebech at Raphia, in consequence of which the latter became tributary, and also of the dethroning of the rebellious king of Ashdod; and still further, that after another king of Ashdod, who had been chosen by the people, had fled to Egypt, he besieged Ashdod with all his army, and took it. Then follows a difficult and mutilated passage, in which Rawlinson (Five Great Monarchies, ii. 416) and Oppert (Les Sargonides, pp. 22, 26, 27) find an account of the complete subjugation of Sebech (see Delitzsch on Isaiah, at <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/20-5.htm">Isaiah 20:5-6</a>). There is apparently a confirmation of this in the monuments recording the deeds of Esarhaddon's successor, whose name is read Assur-bani-pal, according to which that king carried on tedious wars in Egypt against Tirhaka, who had conquered Memphis, Thebes, and sundry other Egyptian cities during the illness of Esarhaddon, and according to his own account, succeeded at length in completely overcoming him, and returned home with rich booty, having first of all taken hostages for future good behaviour (see Spiegel, p. 225). If these inscriptions have been read correctly, it follows from them that from the reign of Sargon the Assyrians made attempts to subjugate Egypt, and were partially successful, though they could not maintain their conquests. The struggle between Assyria and Egypt for supremacy in Hither Asia may also be inferred from the brief notices in the Old Testament (<a href="/2_kings/17-4.htm">2 Kings 17:4</a>) concerning the help which the Israelitish king Hosea expected from So the king of Egypt, and also concerning the advance of Tirhaka against Sennacherib.<p>(Note: From the modern researches concerning ancient Egypt, not the smallest light can be obtained as to any of these things. "The Egyptologists (as J. Bumller observes, p. 245) have hitherto failed to fill up the gaps in the history of Egypt, and have been still less successful in restoring the chronology; for hitherto we have not met with a single well-established date, which we have obtained from a monumental inscription; nor have the monuments enabled us to assign to a single Pharaoh, from the 1st to the 21st, his proper place in the years or centuries of the historical chronology.") </body></html>
