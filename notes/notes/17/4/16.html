But when the cause of Christ and his people demand it, we must take up our cross, and follow him. When Christians are disposed to consult their own ease or safety, rather than the public good, they should be blamed. The law was express, all knew it. It is not thus in the court of the King of kings: to the footstool of his throne of grace we may always come boldly, and may be sure of an answer of peace to the prayer of faith. We are welcome, even into the holiest, through the blood of Jesus. Providence so ordered it, that, just then, the king's affections had cooled toward Esther; her faith and courage thereby were the more tried; and God's goodness in the favour she now found with the king, thereby shone the brighter. Haman no doubt did what he could to set the king against her. Mordecai suggests, that it was a cause which, one way or other, would certainly be carried, and which therefore she might safely venture in. This was the language of strong faith, which staggered not at the promise when the danger was most threatening, but against hope believed in hope. He that by sinful devices will save his life, and will not trust God with it in the way of duty, shall lose it in the way of sin. Divine Providence had regard to this matter, in bringing Esther to be queen. Therefore thou art bound in gratitude to do this service for God and his church, else thou dost not answer the end of thy being raised up. There is wise counsel and design in all the providences of God, which will prove that they are all intended for the good of the church. We should, every one, consider for what end God has put us in the place where we are, and study to answer that end: and take care that we do not let it slip. Having solemnly commended our souls and our cause to God, we may venture upon his service. All dangers are trifling compared with the danger of losing our souls. But the trembling sinner is often as much afraid of casting himself, without reserve, upon the Lord's free mercy, as Esther was of coming before the king. Let him venture, as she did, with earnest prayer and supplication, and he shall fare as well and better than she did. The cause of God must prevail: we are safe in being united to it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/esther/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Again the religious element shows itself.

Prayer and fasting went together in time of sorrow or anxiety or penitence. So David (<a href="/2_samuel/12-16.htm" title="David therefore sought God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night on the earth.">2 Samuel 12:16</a>), Ahab (<a href="/1_kings/21-27.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth on his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly.">1 Kings 21:27</a>), Daniel (<a href="/daniel/9-3.htm" title="And I set my face to the Lord God, to seek by prayer and supplications, with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes:">Daniel 9:3</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">neither eat nor drink three days, night or day</span>] This sounds a very explicit direction to abstain from all food for seventy-two hours. It is, however, possible that for the general body of the Jews here referred to it may not have really meant more than two nights and the intervening day, a part of the twenty-four hour day being for certain purposes reckoned as a whole one. Cp. <a href="/matthew/12-40.htm" title="For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.">Matthew 12:40</a> with <a href="/matthew/28-1.htm" title="In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulcher.">Matthew 28:1</a>. Nevertheless to fast for the longer period is not beyond the limits of Oriental abstemiousness.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">I also and my maidens will fast in like manner</span>] Esther herself cannot have carried out this abstinence in its most rigid form.

For form of expression cp. Jacob’s words in <a href="/genesis/43-14.htm" title="And God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may send away your other brother, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved of my children, I am bereaved.">Genesis 43:14</a>.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/esther/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When Hatach brought this information to Esther, she sent word by him to Mordochai, that she might not go in unto the king unsummoned. &#1488;&#1500; &#1502; &#1514;&#1468;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;, she ordered or commissioned him to Mordochai, viz., to tell him what follows, <a href="/esther/4-11.htm">Esther 4:11</a> : "All the king's servants and the people of the king's provinces (i.e., all the officers and subjects of the king) know, that with respect to every man or woman that shall come in unto the king, into the inner court, that is not called - one (the same) law (is) for him: to put (him) to death, except him to whom the king shall hold out the golden sceptre, that he may live." &#1500;&#1493;&#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1492; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; precede as nominativi absol.; these are followed by two relative clauses, which are succeeded by the anacoluthic predicate &#1491;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493; &#1488;&#1495;&#1514;: one and the same law is for him (&#1491;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;, the law concerning him, the unsummoned appearer, the matter of which is briefly stated by &#1500;&#1492;&#1502;&#1497;&#1514;). In the inner court dwelt the king, seated on his throne (comp. <a href="/esther/5-1.htm">Esther 5:1</a>). The law, that every one entering unbidden should be put to death, was subject to but one exception: &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1502;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1500;&#1489;&#1491;, except him to whom the king stretches out, etc. &#1492;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1496; from &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1496;, appearing only in the present book (<a href="/esther/5-2.htm">Esther 5:2</a>; <a href="/esther/8-4.htm">Esther 8:4</a>), but frequently in Chaldee and Syriac, signifies to hold out, to extend, with &#1500;&#1493;, to or towards him. &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1489;&#1497;&#1496;, the Aramaic form for &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1496;, sceptre. Access to the royal presence had been already rendered difficult by an edict issued by Dejokes the Mede, Herod. 1:9; and among the Persians, none, with the exception of a few individuals (Herod. iii. 118), were permitted to approach the king without being previously announced (Herod. iii. 140; Corn. Nepos, Conon, 3). Any one entering unannounced was punished with death, unless the king, according to this passage, gave it to be understood by stretching forth his sceptre that he was to remain unpunished. It is, however, self-evident, and the fact is confirmed by Herod. iii. 140, that any who desired audience were allowed to announce themselves. Esther might, it seems, have done this. Why, then, did she not make the attempt? The answer lies in her further message to Mordochai: "and I have not been called to come in unto the king these thirty days." From these words it appears, that formerly she had been more frequently summoned before the king. Now, however, a whole month had passed without any invitation. Hence she concluded that the king did not much wish to see her, and for this reason dared not go unto him unbidden. Evidently, too, she was unwilling to be announced, because in that case she would have been obliged immediately to make known to the king the cause of her desiring this interview. And this she would not venture to do, fearing that, considering the great favour in which Haman stood with the king, she might, if she did not provoke his displeasure against herself through her intercession for her people, at least meet with a rejection of her petition. To set aside an irrevocable decree sealed with the king's seal, must have appeared to Esther an impossible undertaking. To have asked such a thing of the king would have been indeed a bold venture. </body></html>
