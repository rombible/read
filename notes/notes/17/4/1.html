It will be noticed that the sorrow both of Mordecai and of the Jews generally (<a href="/esther/4-3.htm" title="And in every province, wherever the king's commandment and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes.">Esther 4:3</a>) is described by external manifestations solely. There is rending of garments, putting on of sackcloth and ashes, fasting and weeping and wailing: there is nothing said of prayer and entreaty to the God of Israel, and strong crying to Him who is able to save. Daniel and Ezra and Nehemiah are all Jews, who, like Mordecai and Esther, have to submit to the rule of the alien, though, unlike them, they, when the danger threatened, besought, and not in vain, the help of their God. (See <a href="/daniel/6-10.htm" title="Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house; and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem, he kneeled on his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime.">Daniel 6:10</a>; <a href="/ezra/8-23.htm" title="So we fasted and sought our God for this: and he was entreated of us.">Ezra 8:23</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/1-4.htm" title="And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned certain days, and fasted, and prayed before the God of heaven,">Nehemiah 1:4</a>, &c.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/esther/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/esther/4-1.htm" title="When Mordecai perceived all that was done, Mordecai rent his clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the middle of the city, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry;">Esther 4:1</a></span>. <span class="ital">And put on sackcloth with ashes — </span>That is, he put on a garment of sackcloth or hair, and sprinkled ashes upon his head. <span class="ital">And cried with a loud and bitter cry — </span>To express his deep sense of the mischief coming upon his people. It was bravely done thus publicly to espouse what he knew to be a righteous cause, and the cause of God, even then when it seemed to be a sinking and desperate cause. The latter Targum upon the book of Esther gives us the following account of Mordecai’s behaviour upon this sad occasion: “He made his complaints in the midst of the streets, saying, ‘What a heavy decree is this, which the king and Haman have passed, not against a part of us, but against us all, to root us out of the earth!’ Whereupon all the Jews flocked about him, and, having caused the book of the law to be brought to the gate of Shushan, he, being covered with sackcloth, read the words of <a href="/context/deuteronomy/4-30.htm" title="When you are in tribulation, and all these things are come on you, even in the latter days, if you turn to the LORD your God, and shall be obedient to his voice;...">Deuteronomy 4:30-31</a>, and then exhorted them to fasting, humiliation, and repentance, after the example of the Ninevites.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/esther/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:1-4 Mordecai avowed his relation to the Jews.

These, being attached to the religion of Zoroaster, would naturally sympathize with the Jews, and be disturbed at their threatened destruction. Even apart from this bond of union, the decree was sufficiently strange and ominous to "perplex" thoughtful citizens. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/esther/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 4<p>Es 4:1-14. Mordecai and the Jews Mourn.<p>1, 2. When Mordecai perceived all that was done&#8212;Relying on the irrevocable nature of a Persian monarch's decree (Da 6:15), Hamman made it known as soon as the royal sanction had been obtained; and Mordecai was, doubtless, among the first to hear of it. On his own account, as well as on that of his countrymen, this astounding decree must have been indescribably distressing. The acts described in this passage are, according to the Oriental fashion, expressive of the most poignant sorrow; and his approach to the gate of the palace, under the impulse of irrepressible emotions, was to make an earnest though vain appeal to the royal mercy. Access, however, to the king's presence was, to a person in his disfigured state, impossible: "for none might enter into the king's gate clothed with sackcloth." But he found means of conveying intelligence of the horrid plot to Queen Esther.The great mourning of Mordecai and the Jews, <span class="bld"><a href="/context/esther/4-1.htm" title="When Mordecai perceived all that was done, Mordecai rent his clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the middle of the city, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry;...">Esther 4:1-3</a></span>.
