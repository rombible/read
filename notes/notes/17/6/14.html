Honour is well bestowed on those that do not think themselves above their business. But Haman could not bear it. What harm had it done him? But that will break a proud man's heart, which will not break a humble man's sleep. His doom was, out of this event, read to him by his wife and his friends. They plainly confessed that the Jews, though scattered through the nations, were special objects of Divine care. Miserable comforters are they all; they did not advise Haman to repent, but foretold his fate as unavoidable.

Haman’s humiliation of the morning doubtless encourages Esther to prefer her petition without further delay.

Several clauses are inserted between, for the purpose of enumerating beforehand all that appertains to such a token of honour: a royal garment, a royal steed, a crown on the head, and one of the chief princes for the carrying out of the honour awarded. The royal garment is not only, as Bertheau justly remarks, such a one as the king is accustomed to wear, but, as is shown by the perf. &#1500;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473;, one which the king has himself already put on or worn. Hence it is not an ordinary state-robe, the so-called Median apparel which the king himself, the chief princes among the Persians, and those on whom the king bestowed such raiment were wont to appear in (Herod. 3.84, 7.116; Xenoph. Cyrop. 8.3.1, comp. with the note of Baehr on Her. 3.84), but a costly garment, the property of the sovereign himself. This was the highest mark of honour that could be shown to a subject. So too was the riding upon a horse on which the king had ridden, and whose head was adorned with a royal crown. &#1504;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503; is perf. Niph., not 1st pers. pl. imperf. Kal, as Maurer insists; and &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; refers to the head of the horse, not to the head of the man to be honoured, as Clericus, Rambach, and most ancient expositors explain the words, in opposition to the natural sense of - &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493; &#1504;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;. We do not indeed find among classical writers any testimony to such an adornment of the royal steed; but the circumstance is not at all improbable, and seems to be corroborated by ancient remains, certain Assyrian and ancient Persian sculptures, representing the horses of the king, and apparently those of princes, with ornaments on their heads terminating in three points, which may be regarded as a kind of crown. The infin. absol. &#1493;&#1504;&#1514;&#1493;&#1503; is a continuation of the preceding jussive &#1497;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;: and they shall give, let them give the garment - to the hand of a man, i.e., hand or deliver to him. The garment and horse are to be delivered to one of the noblest princes, that he may bring them to the individual to be honoured, may array him in the garment, set him on the horse, and proclaim before him as he rides through the city, etc. On &#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, comp. <a href="//biblehub.com/esther/1-4.htm">Esther 1:4</a>, and on the matter itself, <a href="/genesis/41-43.htm">Genesis 41:43</a>. &#1512;&#1495;&#1493;&#1489; is either an open square, the place of public assemblage, the forum, or a collective signifying the wide streets of the city. &#1497;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1499;&#1468;&#1499;&#1492; as in <a href="/deuteronomy/25-9.htm">Deuteronomy 25:9</a> and elsewhere.</body></html>
