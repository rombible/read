The deceitfulness of our own hearts appears in nothing more than in the conceit we have of ourselves and our own performances: against which we should constantly watch and pray. Haman thought the king loved and valued no one but himself, but he was deceived. We should suspect that the esteem which others profess for us, is not so great as it seems to be, that we may not think too well of ourselves, nor trust too much in others. How Haman is struck, when the king bids him do honour to Mordecai the Jew, the very man whom he hated above all men, whose ruin he was now designing!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/esther/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The honors here proposed by Haman were such as Persian monarchs rarely allowed to subjects.
