The deceitfulness of our own hearts appears in nothing more than in the conceit we have of ourselves and our own performances: against which we should constantly watch and pray. Haman thought the king loved and valued no one but himself, but he was deceived. We should suspect that the esteem which others profess for us, is not so great as it seems to be, that we may not think too well of ourselves, nor trust too much in others.

Early morning is a common time for the transaction of business at an Eastern court. Haman was so anxious to get the business on which he was bent despatched, that he had come perhaps even before daybreak, and was waiting in the outer court, to get, if possible, the first audience. This haste of his to effect Mordecai's destruction led to his being the person deputed to do him the highest honour. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/esther/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>He first spoke to them of his wealth and domestic happiness, of the "glory of his riches and the multitude of his children."
