The deceitfulness of our own hearts appears in nothing more than in the conceit we have of ourselves and our own performances: against which we should constantly watch and pray. Haman thought the king loved and valued no one but himself, but he was deceived. We should suspect that the esteem which others profess for us, is not so great as it seems to be, that we may not think too well of ourselves, nor trust too much in others. How Haman is struck, when the king bids him do honour to Mordecai the Jew, the very man whom he hated above all men, whose ruin he was now designing!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/esther/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>It was a settled principle of the Persian government that "Royal Benefactors" were to receive an adequate reward.

The counsellors take it for granted that the king will without hesitation agree to Haman's proposal to execute Mordochai, and therefore advise him at once to make the necessary preparations, so that the hated Jew may be hanged on the morrow before the banquet, and Haman may then go with the king to the feast prepared by the queen, free from all annoyance. &#1490;&#1489; &#1506;&#1509; &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;, to make, i.e., to erect a high tree.
