Ahasuerus Rewards Mordecai for Former Service.<p>1. the king &#8230; commanded to bring the book of records of the chronicles&#8212;In Eastern courts, there are scribes or officers whose duty it is to keep a journal of every occurrence worthy of notice. A book of this kind, abounding with anecdotes, is full of interest. It has been a custom with Eastern kings, in all ages, frequently to cause the annals of the kingdom to be read to them. It is resorted to, not merely as a pastime to while away the tedium of an hour, but as a source of instruction to the monarch, by reviewing the important incidents of his own life, as well as those of his ancestors. There was, therefore, nothing uncommon in this Persian monarch calling for the court journal. But, in his being unable to sleep at that particular juncture, in his ordering the book then to be read to him, and in his attention having been specially directed to the important and as yet unrewarded services of Mordecai, the immediate interposition of Providence is distinctly visible.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/esther/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> He hath had no recompence for this great and good service; which might happen, either through the king’s forgetfulness, or through the envy of the courtiers, or because he was a Jew, and therefore odious and contemptible. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/esther/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the king said, what honour and dignity hath been done to Mordecai for this?....

In Persia, where "royal benefactors" formed a distinct class, and had their names inscribed on a special list (Herod., 8:85), it was especially incumbent on the monarch to see that every such person received a return proportioned to the value of his service. Ahasuerus seems to have supposed that some honour or dignity must have been conferred upon Mordecai, though he could not recollect what it was; and it is difficult to understand how the omission to reward him had occurred, unless there was a prejudice against him among the high court officials, who may have known that he was a Jew, though his fellow-servants did not (<a href="/esther/3-4.htm">Esther 3:4</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/esther/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>He first spoke to them of his wealth and domestic happiness, of the "glory of his riches and the multitude of his children."
