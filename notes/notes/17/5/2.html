He that will lose his life for God, shall save it, or find it in a better life. The king encouraged her. Let us from this be encouraged to pray always to our God, and not to faint. Esther came to a proud, imperious man; but we come to the God of love and grace. She was not called, but we are; the Spirit says, Come, and the Bride says, Come. She had a law against her, we have a promise, many a promise, in favour of us; Ask, and it shall be given you. She had no friend to go with her, or to plead for her; on the contrary, he that was then the king's favourite, was her enemy; but we have an Advocate with the Father, in whom he is well pleased. Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace. God put it into Esther's heart to delay her petition a day longer; she knew not, but God did, what was to happen in that very night.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/esther/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Over against the gate - This is the usual situation of the throne in the "throne-room" of an Oriental palace.

In the bas-reliefs of Persepolis, copied by Sir Robert Ker Porter, we see King Darius enthroned in the midst of his court, and walking abroad in equal state; in either case he carries in his right hand a slender rod or wand, about equal in length to his own height, ornamented with a small knob at the summit. In the Assyrian alabasters, those found at Nimroud as well as those from Khorsabad, "the great king" is furnished with the same appendage of royalty, a slender rod, but destitute of any knob or ornament. On the Khorsabad reliefs the rod is painted red, doubtless to represent gold; proving that "the golden sceptre" was a simple wand of that precious metal, commonly held in the right hand, with one end resting on the ground, and that whether the king was sitting or walking. "The gold sceptre" has received little alteration or modification since ancient times [Goss]. It was extended to Esther as a token not only that her intrusion was pardoned, but that her visit was welcome, and a favorable reception given to the suit she had come to prefer.<p>touched the top of the sceptre&#8212;This was the usual way of acknowledging the royal condescension, and at the same time expressing reverence and submission to the august majesty of the king.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/esther/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The king held out the golden sceptre, </span> in testimony that he pardoned her presumption, and accepted her person, and was ready to grant her petition. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Esther touched the top of his sceptre, </span> in token of her thankful acceptance of the king’s great favour, and of her reverence and submission to his majesty, whereof that might possibly be a usual token, and it may be, at the king’s call and invitation to her to come near to him. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/esther/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, that she obtained favour in his sight,....

The Vulgate makes Esther kiss the sceptre (‘osculata est summitatem virgae eius’). For the Greek apocryphal Additions, presenting a detailed account of Esther’s preparations for the interview and of the interview itself, see chaps. 14, 15.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/esther/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Esther...   touched the top of the sceptre</span>. This was, no doubt, the customary act by which the king's grace was, as it were, accepted and appropriated. It is analogous to that touch of the person or of the garments which secured the suppliant mercy among the Greeks. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/esther/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When what Esther said was reported to Mordochai, he sent word back to her (&#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489;): "Think not in thy soul (with thyself) to be saved in the house of the king above all the Jews; for if thou holdest thy peace at this time, recovery and deliverance will arise from another place, but thou and thy father's house shall be destroyed. And who knows if thou hast attained to royalty for a time such as this?" By the words: "Think not that thou wilt be saved in the king's house above all the Jew," i.e., alone of all the Jews, Mordochai does not reproach Esther with being indifferent to the fate of her fellow-countrymen, but rather calls her attention to the fact that her own life is in danger. This is evident from the clause: if thou hold thy peace, will not intercede with the king for thy people, help will come from some other quarter. &#1512;&#1493;&#1495;  equals  &#1512;&#1493;&#1495;&#1492;, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/8-11.htm">Exodus 8:11</a>, &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, deliverance from oppressive restraint. &#1497;&#1506;&#1502;&#1493;&#1491;, rise up, arise, used according to later custom for &#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;, as in <a href="/1_chronicles/20-4.htm">1 Chronicles 20:4</a>. The thought is: the Jewish nation cannot perish, its continuance is guaranteed by the divine promise. If thou wilt venture nothing for its safety, God will bring deliverance, but destruction will come upon thee and thy family. Though Mordochai neither speaks of God, nor alludes directly to His assistance, he still grounds his hopes of the preservation of his people upon the word and promise of God, and Brentius pertinently remarks: habes hic excellentem ac plane heroicam Mardochaei fidem, qua in praesentissimo ac periculosissimo discrimine videt futuram liberationem. The last clause of <a href="/esther/4-14.htm">Esther 4:14</a> is by most expositors understood as saying: and who knows whether thou hast not for a time like this attained to royalty? This agrees with the sense, but cannot be verbally justified, for &#1488;&#1501; does not mean whether not. The sentence contains an aposiopesis. The clause depending on the conditional &#1488;&#1501; is unspoken, but understood. Besides, &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468; is not in the imperfect. Hence it can only be translated: Who knows, if thou hadst not attained to royalty at or for such a time? Then the clause omitted would be: what thou then wouldst have done. &#1497;&#1493;&#1491;&#1506; &#1502;&#1497; more frequently has the meaning of perhaps; and Mordochai says: perhaps thou hast attained to royalty (to the dignity of queen) for a time like this, sc. to use thy position for the deliverance of thy people. In the turn thus given to the sentence it contains the most urgent injunction to Esther to use her high position for the preservation of her fellow-countrymen. </body></html>
