He that will lose his life for God, shall save it, or find it in a better life. The king encouraged her. Let us from this be encouraged to pray always to our God, and not to faint. Esther came to a proud, imperious man; but we come to the God of love and grace. She was not called, but we are; the Spirit says, Come, and the Bride says, Come. She had a law against her, we have a promise, many a promise, in favour of us; Ask, and it shall be given you. She had no friend to go with her, or to plead for her; on the contrary, he that was then the king's favourite, was her enemy; but we have an Advocate with the Father, in whom he is well pleased. Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace. God put it into Esther's heart to delay her petition a day longer; she knew not, but God did, what was to happen in that very night.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/esther/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Esther seems to have been afraid to make her real request of Xerxes too abruptly.

That is, he ordered some of his servants to make haste and acquaint Haman with the queen's invitation, and to press him to make haste to comply with it: <p>so the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared; which was wisely done, to prepare for what she had to say to the king, when cheerful with wine, and when she had her adversary with him alone. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/esther/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then the king said, Cause Haman to make haste, that he may do as Esther hath said.

Esther returned answer to Mordochai: "Go, gather together all the Jews that are found in Susa, and fast ye for me: I also and my maidens will fast; and so will I go to the king against the law; and if I perish, I perish." Esther resolves to go to the king unsummoned, but begs Mordochai and all the Jews to unite in a three days' fast, during which she and her maidens will also fast, to seek by earnest humiliation God's gracious assistance in the step she proposes to take, for the purpose of averting the threatened destruction of her people. "Though 'God' and 'prayer' are not here mentioned, it is yet obviously assumed that it was before God that the Jews were to humble themselves, to seek His help, and to induce Him to grant it. <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/21-27.htm">1 Kings 21:27-29</a>; <a href="/joel/1-14.htm">Joel 1:14</a>; <a href="/jonah/3-5.htm">Jonah 3:5</a>." (Berth.). To designate the strictness of this fasting, the words: "neither eat nor drink," are added. The "three days, night and day," are not to be reckoned as three times twenty-four hours, but to be understood of a fast which lasts till the third day after that on which it begins; for according to <a href="//biblehub.com/esther/5-1.htm">Esther 5:1</a>, Esther goes to the king on the third day. Comp. the similar definition of time, <a href="/jonah/2-1.htm">Jonah 2:1</a>. The addition "day and night" declares that the fast was not to be intermitted. &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1499;&#1503;, and in thus, i.e., in this state of fasting. &#1499;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1514; &#1500;&#1488; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;: which is not according to law. &#1500;&#1488; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; is used, like the Aramaean form &#1500;&#1488; &#1491;&#1468;&#1497;, in the sense of without (comp. Ewald, 222, c): without according to law  equals  contrary to law. The last words: "if I perish, I perish," etc., are the expression not of despair, but of resignation, or perfect submission to the providence of God; comp. <a href="/genesis/43-14.htm">Genesis 43:14</a>. </body></html>
