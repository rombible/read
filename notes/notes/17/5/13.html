Thus though proud men have much to their mind, if they have not all, it is nothing. The thousandth part of what Haman had, would give a modest, humble man, as much happiness as he expects to receive from any thing under the sun. And Haman as passionately complains as if he was in the lowest depth of poverty.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/esther/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:9-14 This account of Haman is a comment upon Pr 21:24. Self-admirers and self-flatterers are really self-deceivers. Haman, the higher he is lifted up, the more impatient he is of contempt, and the more enraged at it. The affront from Mordecai spoiled all. A slight affront, which a humble man would scarcely notice, will torment a proud man, even to madness, and will mar all his comforts. Those disposed to be uneasy, will never want something to be uneasy at. Such are proud men; though they have much to their mind, if they have not all to their mind, it is as nothing to them. Many call the proud happy, who display pomp and make a show; but this is a mistaken thought. Many poor cottagers feel far less uneasiness than the rich, with all their fancied advantages around them. The man who knows not Christ, is poor though he be rich, because he is utterly destitute of that which alone is true riches.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/esther/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The multitude of his children - Herodotus tells us that, next to prowess in arms, it was regarded as the greatest proof of manly excellence in Persia to be the father of many sons."

Either Mordecai was come, having laid by his sackcloth for this time, that he might be in a capacity of coming thither, and so of understanding how matters proceeded. Besides, this was a private fast, and so he was not obliged always to wear his sackcloth in public, during the whole time of the fast, though he did once come abroad with it, that the cause of it might be publicly known, and so come to Esther’s ears. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/esther/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Yet all this availeth me nothing,....

The bitter drop in his cup deprived Haman's life of all sweetness. He had not learned the wisdom of setting pleasure against pain, joy against sorrow, satisfaction against annoyance. Much less had he taught himself to look upon the vexations and trials of life as blessings in disguise. His was a coarse and undisciplined nature, little better than that of a savage, albeit he was the chief minister of the first monarch in the world. So little proof is worldly greatness of either greatness or goodness of soul <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/esther/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Esther answered: "My petition and my request - if I have found favour in the sight of the king, and if it please the king to grant my petition and to do my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them, and to-morrow I will do as the king hath said," i.e., make known my request. Though the king had, in the midst of the gaiety, asked what was Esther's request, she did not esteem the time an appropriate one for expressing it. She begins: my petition and my request, - but then stops, and says only, if the king will do her the favour to come with Haman to a banquet again on the morrow, she will then bring forward her petition. Esther invited Haman with the king on both occasions, that, as Calovius remarks, eum apud regem praesentem accusaret decreti surrepti contra suos populares nomine, et in os omnes cavillandi vias ei praecluderet. </body></html>
