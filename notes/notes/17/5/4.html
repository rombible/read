She therefore temporises; she at any rate gains time, she secures a specially favourable opportunity for bringing forward the request, and the king clearly sees that she has kept her real petition in reserve by himself again raising the question. It will be noticed that so long as Esther is working her way up to the due vantage-ground, the king is addressed in the third person, let the king come,” but when she makes the decisive appeal, in the second, “in thy sight, O king.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/esther/5.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/esther/5-4.htm" title="And Esther answered, If it seem good to the king, let the king and Haman come this day to the banquet that I have prepared for him.">Esther 5:4</a></span>. <span class="ital">Let the king and Haman come this day unto the banquet — </span>She thought it prudent not to open her mind to him immediately, but first to try how he stood affected to her, and endeavour to endear herself more to him, that he might be the better disposed to grant her request.

And she, each time, invited Haman, that by showing such respect to the king’s great favourite she might insinuate herself the more into the king’s affection; and that, if she saw fit, she might then present her request to the king. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/esther/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:1-8 Esther having had power with God, and prevailing, like Jacob, had power with men too. He that will lose his life for God, shall save it, or find it in a better life. The king encouraged her. Let us from this be encouraged to pray always to our God, and not to faint. Esther came to a proud, imperious man; but we come to the God of love and grace. She was not called, but we are; the Spirit says, Come, and the Bride says, Come. She had a law against her, we have a promise, many a promise, in favour of us; Ask, and it shall be given you. She had no friend to go with her, or to plead for her; on the contrary, he that was then the king's favourite, was her enemy; but we have an Advocate with the Father, in whom he is well pleased. Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace. God put it into Esther's heart to delay her petition a day longer; she knew not, but God did, what was to happen in that very night.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/esther/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Esther seems to have been afraid to make her real request of Xerxes too abruptly.

That a subject like Haman should be admitted to make a third at the banquet to which the king was invited by his consort, seemed a specially marked instance of favour, arising from the position which the minister held in the estimation of his royal master. The higher the honour paid, the more startling and effective is the favourite’s ruin.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/esther/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let the king and Haman come this day unto the banquet that l have prepared.</span> Such an invitation as this was very unusual. Ordinarily the king and queen dined separately, each in their own apartments; family gatherings, however, not being unknown (Plut., 'Vit. Artaxerx.,' &sect; 5; Athen., 'Deipnsoph.,' 4. p. 145, A). But for the queen to invite not only the king, but also another male guest, not a relation, was a remarkable innovation, and must have seemed to the fortunate recipient of the invitation a high act of favour. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/esther/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>This pressing monition produced its result. Esther returned answer to Mordochai: "Go, gather together all the Jews that are found in Susa, and fast ye for me: I also and my maidens will fast; and so will I go to the king against the law; and if I perish, I perish." Esther resolves to go to the king unsummoned, but begs Mordochai and all the Jews to unite in a three days' fast, during which she and her maidens will also fast, to seek by earnest humiliation God's gracious assistance in the step she proposes to take, for the purpose of averting the threatened destruction of her people. "Though 'God' and 'prayer' are not here mentioned, it is yet obviously assumed that it was before God that the Jews were to humble themselves, to seek His help, and to induce Him to grant it. <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/21-27.htm">1 Kings 21:27-29</a>; <a href="/joel/1-14.htm">Joel 1:14</a>; <a href="/jonah/3-5.htm">Jonah 3:5</a>." (Berth.). To designate the strictness of this fasting, the words: "neither eat nor drink," are added. The "three days, night and day," are not to be reckoned as three times twenty-four hours, but to be understood of a fast which lasts till the third day after that on which it begins; for according to <a href="//biblehub.com/esther/5-1.htm">Esther 5:1</a>, Esther goes to the king on the third day. Comp. the similar definition of time, <a href="/jonah/2-1.htm">Jonah 2:1</a>.

Ewald, 222, c): without according to law  equals  contrary to law. The last words: "if I perish, I perish," etc., are the expression not of despair, but of resignation, or perfect submission to the providence of God; comp. <a href="/genesis/43-14.htm">Genesis 43:14</a>. </body></html>
