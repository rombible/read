These things are not worth notice, but as marks of the king's favour, and the fruit of God's favour to his church. It is well with a land, when ensigns of dignity are made the ornaments of serious piety. When the church prospers, many will join it, who will be shy of it when in trouble. When believers have rest, and walk in the fear of the Lord, and the comfort of the Holy Ghost, they will be multiplied.

"And it was written according to all that Mordochai commanded." They were sent to the Jews and to the satraps, etc., of the whole wide realm from India to Ethiopia (see <a href="/esther/1-1.htm">Esther 1:1</a>), while those of Haman had been issued only to the satraps, etc. The rest coincides with <a href="/esther/3-12.htm">Esther 3:12</a>. &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1499;&#1514;&#1468;&#1489;, and he (Mordochai) wrote.

So Haug in Ewald's bibl. Jahrb. v. p. 154. The older explanation, mules, on the other hand, is founded on the modern Persian estar, which, to judge from the Sanscrit avatara, must in ancient Persian have been apatara. &#1512;&#1502;&#1468;&#1499;&#1497;&#1501;, &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. from &#1512;&#1502;&#1468;&#1498;, answering to the Syriac remakaa', herd, especially a herd of horses, and to the Arabic ramaka, stud, is explained by Bertheau as a superlative form for the animal who excels the rest of the herd of stud in activity, perhaps the breeding stallion, while others understand it of the stud in general. The contents of the edict follow in <a href="/esther/8-11.htm">Esther 8:11</a> and <a href="/esther/8-12.htm">Esther 8:12</a> : "that the king allows the Jews in every city to assemble and to stand for their life (i.e., to fight for their lives, comp. <a href="/daniel/12-1.htm">Daniel 12:1</a>), to destroy, to slay, and to cause to perish all the power (&#1495;&#1497;&#1500;, military power) of the people and province that should assault them, children and women, and to plunder their property, upon a certain day," etc. The appointed time is thus stated as in <a href="/esther/3-13.htm">Esther 3:13</a>. The Jews were thus authorized to attack and destroy all enemies who should assault them on the day appointed for their extermination. <a href="/esther/8-13.htm">Esther 8:13</a> coincides with <a href="//biblehub.com/esther/3-14.htm">Esther 3:14</a>, with this difference, that the Jews are to be ready on this day to avenge themselves on their enemies. <a href="/esther/8-14.htm">Esther 8:14</a> also is similar to <a href="//biblehub.com/esther/3-15.htm">Esther 3:15</a>, except that the expression is strengthened by an addition to &#1492;&#1512;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501; as in <a href="//biblehub.com/esther/8-10.htm">Esther 8:10</a>, and by that of &#1491;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1497;&#1501;, urged on, to &#1502;&#1489;&#1492;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, hastened, to point out the utmost despatch possible. </body></html>
