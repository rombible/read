Esther, though safe herself, fell down and begged for the deliverance of her people. We read of no tears when she begged for her own life, but although she was sure of that, she wept for her people. Tears of pity and tenderness are the most Christ-like. According to the constitution of the Persian government, no law or decree could be repealed or recalled. This is so far from speaking to the wisdom and honour of the Medes and Persians, that it clearly shows their pride and folly. This savours of that old presumption which ruined all, We will be as gods! It is God's prerogative not to repent, or to say what can never be altered or unsaid. Yet a way was found, by another decree, to authorize the Jews to stand upon their defence. The decree was published in the languages of all the provinces. Shall all the subjects of an earthly prince have his decrees in languages they understand, and shall God's oracles and laws be locked up from any of his servants in an unknown tongue?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/esther/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Though Haman was dead, his work was not yet undone. The royal decree had gone forth, and, according to Persian notions, could not be directly recalled or reversed <a href="/esther/8-8.htm">Esther 8:8</a>. Mordecai did not dare, without express permission from the king, to take any steps even to stay execution. And Esther, being in favor, once more took the initiative. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/esther/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5, 6. reverse the letters devised by Haman &#8230; to destroy the Jews&#8212;The whole conduct of Esther in this matter is characterized by great tact, and the variety of expressions by which she describes her willing submission to her royal husband, the address with which she rolls the whole infamy of the meditated massacre on Haman, and the argument she draws from the king's sanction being surreptitiously obtained, that the decree should be immediately reversed&#8212;all indicate the queen's wisdom and skill, and she succeeded in this point also.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/esther/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> My heart will sink under it, and I shall never be able to survive it. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/esther/8.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For how can I endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people?.... I cannot bear it; it will break my heart; I shall die to see all my people massacred throughout the realm; the thought of it is shocking and shuddering; to see it, intolerable: or "how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred?" the same thing in different words, and somewhat more express and explanative. She explains the evil coming upon her people of the utter destruction of them, not barely an oppression, but an extermination of them; and she makes use of a word expressive of their relation to her, as more endearing, being her kindred; she and they being, as it were, of the same family, and with whom she could not but sympathize in distress. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/esther/8.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For how can I endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people? or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred?</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/esther/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Then said Harbonah (already mentioned <a href="/esther/1-10.htm">Esther 1:10</a>), one of the eunuchs before the king, i.e., who held office before the king: "Behold also the tree which Haman made (comp. <a href="/esther/5-14.htm">Esther 5:14</a>) stands in the house of Haman." &#1490;&#1468;&#1501; points to the fact that the other eunuchs had already brought forward various particulars concerning Haman's crime.

On this tree the king ordered that Haman should be hanged, and this sentence was executed without delay. - "And the king's wrath was pacified." With this remark the narrative of this occurrence is closed, and the history pursues its further course as follows. </body></html>
