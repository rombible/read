Esther, though safe herself, fell down and begged for the deliverance of her people. We read of no tears when she begged for her own life, but although she was sure of that, she wept for her people. Tears of pity and tenderness are the most Christ-like. According to the constitution of the Persian government, no law or decree could be repealed or recalled. This is so far from speaking to the wisdom and honour of the Medes and Persians, that it clearly shows their pride and folly. This savours of that old presumption which ruined all, We will be as gods! It is God's prerogative not to repent, or to say what can never be altered or unsaid. Yet a way was found, by another decree, to authorize the Jews to stand upon their defence. The decree was published in the languages of all the provinces. Shall all the subjects of an earthly prince have his decrees in languages they understand, and shall God's oracles and laws be locked up from any of his servants in an unknown tongue?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/esther/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Though Haman was dead, his work was not yet undone.

The infin. &#1500;&#1499;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473; after the interrogatory particle signifies: Is violence to be done, i.e., shall violence be done? as in <a href="/1_chronicles/15-2.htm">1 Chronicles 15:2</a> and elsewhere; comp. Ewald, 237, c. &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473;, to tread under foot, to subdue, used here in the more general sense, to offer violence. Without waiting for an explanation, the king, still more infuriated, passes sentence of death upon Haman. This is not given in so many words by the historian, but we are told immediately that: "as the word went out of the king's mouth, they covered Haman's face." &#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; is not the speech of the king just reported, but the judicial sentence, the death warrant, i.e., the word to punish Haman with death. This is unmistakeably shown by the further statement: they covered Haman's face. The subject is indefinite: the attendants present. To cover the face was indeed to begin to carry the sentence of death into execution. With respect to this custom, expositors appeal to Curtius, vi. 8. 22: Philetam - capite velato in regiam adducunt; and Cicero, pro C. Rabirio iv. 13: I lictor, colliga manus, caput obnubito, arbori infelici suspendito.</body></html>
