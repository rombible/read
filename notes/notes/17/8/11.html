Esther, though safe herself, fell down and begged for the deliverance of her people. We read of no tears when she begged for her own life, but although she was sure of that, she wept for her people. Tears of pity and tenderness are the most Christ-like. According to the constitution of the Persian government, no law or decree could be repealed or recalled. This is so far from speaking to the wisdom and honour of the Medes and Persians, that it clearly shows their pride and folly. This savours of that old presumption which ruined all, We will be as gods! It is God's prerogative not to repent, or to say what can never be altered or unsaid. Yet a way was found, by another decree, to authorize the Jews to stand upon their defence. The decree was published in the languages of all the provinces. Shall all the subjects of an earthly prince have his decrees in languages they understand, and shall God's oracles and laws be locked up from any of his servants in an unknown tongue?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/esther/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This fresh decree allowed the Jews to stand on their defense, and to kill all who attacked them. It has been pronounced incredible that any king would thus have sanctioned civil war in all the great cities of his empire; but some even of the more skeptical critics allow that "Xerxes" might not improbably have done so. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/esther/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11-13. the king granted the Jews &#8230; to stand for their life &#8230; to slay &#8230; all &#8230; that would assault them&#8212;The fixed and unalterable character claimed for Persian edicts often placed the king in a very awkward dilemma; for, however bitterly he might regret things done in a moment of haste and thoughtlessness, it was beyond even his power to prevent the consequences. This was the reason on account of which the king was laid under a necessity not to reverse, but to issue a contradictory edict; according to which it was enacted that if, pursuant to the first decree, the Jews were assaulted, they might, by virtue of the second, defend themselves and even slay their enemies. However strange and even ridiculous this mode of procedure may appear, it was the only one which, from the peculiarities of court etiquette in Persia, could be adopted. Instances occur in sacred (Da 6:14), no less than profane, history. Many passages of the Bible attest the truth of this, particularly the well-known incident of Daniel's being cast into the den of lions, in conformity with the rash decree of Darius, though, as it afterwards appeared, contrary to the personal desire of that monarch. That the law of Persia has undergone no change in this respect, and the power of the monarch not less immutable, appear from many anecdotes related in the books of modern travellers through that country.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/esther/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">To stand for their life; </span> to stand up and fight for the de fence of their lives against all that should seek to destroy them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">All the power of the people; </span> either governors or governed, without any exception, either of age, dignity, or sex, as it follows. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Both little ones and women; </span> which is here added, because it was put into the former decree; and to strike the greater terror into their enemies; and according to the laws and customs of this kingdom, whereby children were punished for their parents’ offences; which also in some cases was allowed and practised in sacred story.
