Esther, though safe herself, fell down and begged for the deliverance of her people. We read of no tears when she begged for her own life, but although she was sure of that, she wept for her people. Tears of pity and tenderness are the most Christ-like. According to the constitution of the Persian government, no law or decree could be repealed or recalled. This is so far from speaking to the wisdom and honour of the Medes and Persians, that it clearly shows their pride and folly. This savours of that old presumption which ruined all, We will be as gods! It is God's prerogative not to repent, or to say what can never be altered or unsaid. Yet a way was found, by another decree, to authorize the Jews to stand upon their defence. The decree was published in the languages of all the provinces.

This heap of phrases, which signify much the same thing, are used to work upon the king's affections, and to show how submissive she was to his will: <p>let it be written to reverse the letters devised by Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews which are in all the king's provinces.

The latter however points out in reply that what has received the authority of the king’s seal ‘may no man reverse.’ The most that can now be done is to address to all concerned (intended victims and governors alike) letters equally authoritative, which shall have the effect of neutralising, so far as may be possible, those which have already gone forth.

To ask the king to unsay his own words was impossible. By representing the letters as devised by Haman, and written by Haman, Esther avoids doing so. But she thereby blinks the truth. In excuse she adds the striking distich contained in the next verse - "For how could I endure to see the evil that is coming on my people? or how could I endure to see the destruction of my kindred?" <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/esther/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Then said Harbonah (already mentioned <a href="/esther/1-10.htm">Esther 1:10</a>), one of the eunuchs before the king, i.e., who held office before the king: "Behold also the tree which Haman made (comp. <a href="/esther/5-14.htm">Esther 5:14</a>) stands in the house of Haman." &#1490;&#1468;&#1501; points to the fact that the other eunuchs had already brought forward various particulars concerning Haman's crime.

On this tree the king ordered that Haman should be hanged, and this sentence was executed without delay. - "And the king's wrath was pacified."
