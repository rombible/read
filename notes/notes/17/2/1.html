Esther was preferred as queen. Those who suggest that Esther committed sin to come at this dignity, do not consider the custom of those times and countries. Every one that the king took was married to him, and was his wife, though of a lower rank. But how low is human nature sunk, when such as these are the leading pursuits and highest worldly happiness of men! Disappointment and vexation must follow; and he most wisely consults his enjoyment, even in this present life, who most exactly obeys the precepts of the Divine law. But let us turn to consider the wise and merciful providence of God, carrying on his deep but holy designs in the midst of all this.

Esther Chosen to Be Queen.<p>1-3. After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was appeased&#8212;On recovering from the violent excitement of his revelry and rage, the king was pierced with poignant regret for the unmerited treatment he had given to his beautiful and dignified queen. But, according to the law, which made the word of a Persian king irrevocable, she could not be restored. His counsellors, for their own sake, were solicitous to remove his disquietude, and hastened to recommend the adoption of all suitable means for gratifying their royal master with another consort of equal or superior attractions to those of his divorced queen. In the despotic countries of the East the custom obtains that when an order is sent to a family for a young damsel to repair to the royal palace, the parents, however unwilling, dare not refuse the honor for their daughter; and although they know that when she is once in the royal harem, they will never see her again, they are obliged to yield a silent and passive compliance. On the occasion referred to, a general search was commanded to be made for the greatest beauties throughout the empire, in the hope that, from their ranks, the disconsolate monarch might select one for the honor of succeeding to the royal honors of Vashti. The damsels, on arrival at the palace, were placed under the custody of "Hege, the king's chamberlain, keeper of the women," that is, the chief eunuch, usually a repulsive old man, on whom the court ladies are very dependent, and whose favor they are always desirous to secure.The virgins of the kingdom being gathered together, a queen is to be chosen, <span class="bld"><a href="/context/esther/2-1.htm" title="After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was appeased, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed against her....">Esther 2:1-4</a></span>.

These Versions seem to have had their origin in a religious necessity, when the use of the Hebrew language was dying out as the speech of ordinary life. But the Targums on Esther and the other Megilloth (Rolls) are thought, unlike earlier ones, not to have been intended for public use. They were composed after the need for Aramaic translations had passed away, but, inasmuch as these came to be permanently cherished, the later ones were modelled upon them, and thus present us in the main with the same features.[89]]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[89] See further in Hastings’ <span class="ital">Dict. of the Bible</span>, Art. <span class="ital">Targum</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>After these things, when he had recovered and calmed down from his excessive potations, and when the violence of king Ahasuerus’s rage had abated, he began to remember Vashti. His great men answered him and spake thus, Art thou not he that passed sentence upon her, that she should die for what she did? The king said to them, I did not command that she should be put to death, but that she should present herself before me, and when she did not present herself, I commanded that she should be deprived of her queenly rank. They said to him, It is not so, but thou didst pronounce sentence of death upon her at the instance of the seven princes. Forthwith he was violently enraged, and ordered that the seven princes should be hung upon the gibbet. And the king’s young men who ministered to him said, Let there be sought out for the king’s needs young virgins, fair to look upon, and let the king appoint officers in every province of his kingdom, and let them assemble all young virgins that are fair to look upon unto Shushan the palace to the house of the women where there are baths and washing places, and where Hegai, the king’s chief eunuch, custodian of the women, holds office, and let it be decreed that unguents for their anointing be furnished to them, and let the young woman who finds favour in the eyes of the king be raised to the rank of queen in the place of Vashti. And the thing was pleasing in the king’s sight, and he did thus.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/esther/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The counsel of the wise men. <a href="/esther/1-16.htm">Esther 1:16</a>. Memucan, who was the last mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/esther/1-14.htm">Esther 1:14</a>, comes forward as spokesman for the rest, and declares before the king and the princes, i.e., in a solemn assembly, and evidently as the result of a previous joint consultation: Vashti the queen has not done wrong to the king alone, but also to all the princes and all the people, because the example of the queen will lead all the Median and Persian wives to despise their husbands. Therefore an irrevocable edict is to be published decreeing the divorce of Queen Vashti, and this law published throughout the whole realm, that all wives may show honour to their husbands. Vashti has not transgressed against the king alone (<a href="/esther/1-16.htm">Esther 1:16</a>), but against all the princes and people in all the provinces of King Ahashverosh (<a href="/esther/1-16.htm">Esther 1:16</a>). In what respect, then, is the latter assertion true? We are told <a href="/esther/1-17.htm">Esther 1:17</a> and <a href="/esther/1-18.htm">Esther 1:18</a>. "For the deed of the queen will come abroad to (&#1506;&#1500; for &#1488;&#1500;) all women, to bring their husbands into contempt in their eyes (the infin. &#1500;&#1492;&#1489;&#1494;&#1493;&#1514; stating the result), while they will say," etc. (the suffix of &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1501; relates to the women, who will appeal to the disobedience of the queen). <a href="/esther/1-18.htm">Esther 1:18</a>. "And this day (i.e., already) the princesses of the Persians and Medians, who hear of the act of the queen (&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;, not the word, but the thing, i.e., her rejection of her husband's command), will tell it to all the princes of the king, and (there will be) enough contempt and provocation. &#1511;&#1510;&#1507; is an outburst of anger; here, therefore, a provocation to wrath. Bertheau makes the words &#1494;&#1511; &#1489;&#1494; &#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1491;&#1497; the object of &#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1504;&#1492;, which, after the long parenthesis, is united to the copula by w, and for, "to speak contempt and wrath," reads: to speak contemptuously in wrath. But this change cannot be substantiated. The expression, to speak wrath, is indeed unexampled, but that is no reason for making &#1511;&#1510;&#1507; stand for &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1510;&#1507;, the very adoption of such an ellipsis showing, that this explanation is inadmissible. The words must be taken alone, as an independent clause, which may be readily completed by &#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492;: and contempt and wrath will be according to abundance. &#1499;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497; is a litotes for: more than enough. The object of &#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1504;&#1492; must be supplied from the context: it - that is, what the queen said to her husband. In the former verse Memucan was speaking of all women; here (<a href="/esther/1-18.htm">Esther 1:18</a>) he speaks only of the princesses of the Persians and Medes, because these are staying in the neighbourhood of the court, and will immediately hear of the matter, and "after the manner of the court ladies and associates of a queen will quickly follow, and appeal to her example" (Berth.). </body></html>
