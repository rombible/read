Esther was preferred as queen. Those who suggest that Esther committed sin to come at this dignity, do not consider the custom of those times and countries. Every one that the king took was married to him, and was his wife, though of a lower rank. But how low is human nature sunk, when such as these are the leading pursuits and highest worldly happiness of men! Disappointment and vexation must follow; and he most wisely consults his enjoyment, even in this present life, who most exactly obeys the precepts of the Divine law. But let us turn to consider the wise and merciful providence of God, carrying on his deep but holy designs in the midst of all this.

There was (dwelt) in the citadel of Susa a Jew of the name of Mordochai (&#1502;&#1512;&#1491;&#1468;&#1499;&#1497;, in more correct editions &#1502;&#1512;&#1491;&#1499;&#1497;), the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite (&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; like <a href="/1_samuel/9-1.htm">1 Samuel 9:1</a>). Jair, Shimei, and Kish can hardly mean the father, grandfather, and great-grandfather of Mordochai. On the contrary, if Jair were perhaps his father, Shimei and Kish may have been the names of renowned ancestors. Shimei was probably the son of Gera, well known to us from the history of David, <a href="/2_samuel/16-5.htm">2 Samuel 16:5</a>. and <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/2-8.htm">1 Kings 2:8</a>, <a href="/1_kings/2-36.htm">1 Kings 2:36</a>., and Kish the father of Saul, <a href="/1_chronicles/8-33.htm">1 Chronicles 8:33</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/9-1.htm">1 Samuel 9:1</a>; for in genealogical series only a few noted names are generally given; comp., e.g., <a href="/1_chronicles/9-19.htm">1 Chronicles 9:19</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/6-24.htm">1 Chronicles 6:24</a>. Upon the ground of this explanation, Josephus (Ant. xi. 6) makes Esther of royal descent, viz., of the line of Saul, king of Israel; and the Targum regards Shimei as the Benjamite who cursed David. The name Mordochai occurs in <a href="/ezra/2-2.htm">Ezra 2:2</a> and <a href="/nehemiah/7-7.htm">Nehemiah 7:7</a> as that of some other individual among those who returned from captivity with Zerubbabel, but can hardly be connected with the Persian mrdky, little man. Aben Ezra, Lightfoot, and others, indeed, are of opinion that the Mordochai of the present book really came up with Zerubbabel, but subsequently returned to Babylon. Identity of name is not, however, a sufficient proof of identity of person. The chronological statement, <a href="/esther/2-6.htm">Esther 2:6</a> : who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captives who had been carried away with Jeconiah, king of Judah, etc., offers some difficulty. For from the captivity of Jeconiah in the year 599 to the beginning of the reign of Xerxes (in the year 486) is a period of 113 years; hence, if the &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; is referred to Mordochai, he would, even if carried into captivity as a child by then, have reached the age of from 120 to 130 years, and as Esther was not made queen till the seventh year of Xerxes (<a href="/esther/2-16.htm">Esther 2:16</a>), would have become prime minister of that monarch at about the age of 125. Rambach, indeed, does not find this age incredible, though we cannot regard it as probable that Mordochai should have become minister at so advanced an age.<p>(Note: Baumg. aptly remarks, l.c., p. 125: Etsi concedendum est, non esse contra naturam, si Mordechaeus ad illam aetatem pervenerit, et summa hac constitutus senectute gravissimis negotiis perficiendis par fuerit, tamen est hoc rarissimum et nisi accedit certum testimonium, difficile ad credendum.)<p>On this account Clericus, Baumgarten, and others refer the relative &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; to the last name, Kish, and understand that he was carried away with Jeconiah, while his great-grandson Mordochai was born in captivity. In this case Kish and Shimei must be regarded as the great-grandfather and grandfather of Mordochai. We grant the possibility of this view; nevertheless it is more in accordance with the Hebrew narrative style to refer &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; to the chief person of the sentence preceding it, viz., Mordochai, who also continues to be spoken of in <a href="/esther/2-7.htm">Esther 2:7</a>. Hence we prefer this reference, without, however, attributing to Mordochai more than 120 years of age. For the relative clause: who had been carried away, need not be so strictly understood as to assert that Mordochai himself was carried away; but the object being to give merely his origin and lineage, and not his history, it involves only the notion that he belonged to those Jews who were carried to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar with Jeconiah, so that he, though born in captivity, was carried to Babylon in the persons of his forefathers. This view of the passage corresponds with that formerly presented by the list of the grandchildren and great-grandchildren of Jacob who went down with him to Egypt; see the explanation of the passage in question.<p>(Note: Baumgarten also considers this view admissible, rightly remarking, p. 127: Scriptoribus sacris admodum familiare est singulos homines non per se et sepositos spectare, sed familias et gentes ut corpora quasi individua complecti, ita ut posteri majorum personis quasi contenti et inclusi, majores vero in posteris ipsi subsistere et vivere existimentur. Ex hac ratione Mordechaeus captus esse dici potest, quamvis ipse satis diu post Jechoniae tempora ex iis, qui a Nebucadnezaro abducti sunt, natus fuerit.)<p><a href="/esther/2-7.htm">Esther 2:7</a>. Mordochai was &#1488;&#1502;&#1503;, keeper, bringer up, i.e., foster-father, to Hadassh (&#1488;&#1502;&#1503; constructed as a participle with &#1488;&#1514;). &#1492;&#1491;&#1505;&#1468;&#1492; means a myrtle (&#1492;&#1491;&#1505; in the Shemitish), like the Greek name &#x39c;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;, &#x39c;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;. "That is Esther," the queen known by the name of Esther. The name &#1488;&#1505;&#1514;&#1468;&#1512; is the Old-Persian stara with &#1488; prosthetic, and corresponds with the Greek &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;, star, in modern Persian sitareh. She was &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1470;&#1491;&#1468;&#1491;&#1493;, daughter of his father's brother, and adopted by Mordochai after the death of her parents; we are told, moreover, that she had a fine figure and beautiful countenance. Her father, whose name, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/esther/2-15.htm">Esther 2:15</a>, was Abihail, was uncle to Mordochai, and hence Esther was his cousin. </body></html>
