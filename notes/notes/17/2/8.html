Esther was preferred as queen. Those who suggest that Esther committed sin to come at this dignity, do not consider the custom of those times and countries. Every one that the king took was married to him, and was his wife, though of a lower rank. But how low is human nature sunk, when such as these are the leading pursuits and highest worldly happiness of men! Disappointment and vexation must follow; and he most wisely consults his enjoyment, even in this present life, who most exactly obeys the precepts of the Divine law. But let us turn to consider the wise and merciful providence of God, carrying on his deep but holy designs in the midst of all this. And let no change in our condition be a pretext for forgetting our duties to parents, or the friends who have stood in their place.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/esther/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Hadassah, &#1492;&#1491;&#1505;&#1492;  ha&#774;dassa&#770;h from &#1492;&#1491;&#1505;  ha&#774;das ("myrtle") would seem to have been the Hebrew, and Esther the Persian, name of the damsel.

Now in Shushan the palace there was a certain Jew&#8212;Mordecai held some office about the court. But his "sitting at the king's gate" (Es 2:21) does not necessarily imply that he was in the humble condition of a porter; for, according to an institute of Cyrus, all state officers were required to wait in the outer courts till they were summoned into the presence chamber. He might, therefore, have been a person of some official dignity. This man had an orphan cousin, born during the exile, under his care, who being distinguished by great personal beauty, was one of the young damsels taken into the royal harem on this occasion. She had the good fortune at once to gain the good will of the chief eunuch [Es 2:9]. Her sweet and amiable appearance made her a favorite with all who looked upon her (Es 2:15, last clause). Her Hebrew name (Es 2:7) was Hadassah, that is, "myrtle," which, on her introduction into the royal harem, was changed to Esther, that is, the star Venus, indicating beauty and good fortune [Gesenius].<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/esther/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Esther was brought, </span> or <span class="ital">taken</span>, and that by force, as that word oft signifies.

To prevent, then, a return of affection for his rejected wife ensuing, - a circumstance which might greatly endanger all who had concurred in effecting her repudiation, - the servants of the king, i.e., the court officials who were about him, said: "Let there be young maidens, virgins fair to look on, sought for the king." &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514;, virgins, is added to &#1504;&#1506;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, the latter word signifying merely young women of marriageable age. <a href="/esther/2-3.htm">Esther 2:3</a>.

To the hand of Hega, i.e., to his care and superintendence, under which, as appears from <a href="//biblehub.com/esther/2-12.htm">Esther 2:12</a>, every maiden received into the house of the women had to pass a year before she was brought before the king. Hega (called Hegai, <a href="/esther/2-8.htm">Esther 2:8</a> and <a href="/esther/2-15.htm">Esther 2:15</a>) was an eunuch, the keeper of the women, i.e., superintendent of the royal harem. &#1493;&#1504;&#1514;&#1493;&#1503; is the infin. abs., used instead of the verb. fin. to give prominence to the matter: let them appoint. &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1512;&#1511;&#1493;&#1501;, from &#1502;&#1512;&#1511;, to rub, to polish, signifies purification and adornment with all kind of precious ointments; comp. <a href="/esther/2-12.htm">Esther 2:12</a>.
