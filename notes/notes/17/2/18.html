Esther was preferred as queen. Those who suggest that Esther committed sin to come at this dignity, do not consider the custom of those times and countries. Every one that the king took was married to him, and was his wife, though of a lower rank. But how low is human nature sunk, when such as these are the leading pursuits and highest worldly happiness of men! Disappointment and vexation must follow; and he most wisely consults his enjoyment, even in this present life, who most exactly obeys the precepts of the Divine law. But let us turn to consider the wise and merciful providence of God, carrying on his deep but holy designs in the midst of all this.

Literally, that is, "in right royal fashion" (see <a href="/esther/1-7.htm">Esther 1:7</a>). The practice of making presents, so common in the East at all times, was much in vogue among the Persians, and was practised especially by the monarchs (Herod., 1:136; 3:135; 7:26; Xen., 'Cyrop.,' 8:2, &sect; 7, <span class="accented">et seq.</span>; 'Anab.,' 1:9, &sect; 22, etc.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 2:19-23 MORDECAI'S DISCOVERY OF A PLOT AGAINST AHASUERUS' LIFE (<a href="/esther/2-19.htm">Esther 2:19-23</a>). Some time after Esther had been made queen, there was a second collection of virgins at Susa (ver. 19), under circumstances which are not related, and which were probably of small importance. <span class="accented">At this time</span> (ver. 21) Mordecai, still serving in his humble office at the palace gate, from which he had not been advanced, since Esther had told no one that he was her relation (ver. 20), happened to detect a conspiracy against the king's life, which had been formed by two of the palace eunuchs, Bigthan and Tercsh, whom Ahasuerus had somehow offended (ver. 21). Being still in the habit of holding communication with Esther, Mordecai was able to make her acquainted with the facts, of which she then informed the king, telling him how she had obtained her knowledge (ver. 22). There was nothing surprising or suspicious in a eunuch of the palace having had speech with the queen, especially when he had intelligence of such importance to impart to her. On inquiry, the king found that Mordecai's information was correct; the conspiracy was laid bare, and the conspirators put to death (ver. 23) - the facts being, as was sure to be the case, entered in the court chronicle, a daily record of the life of the court, and of the circumstances that befell the king. It was to have been expected that Mordecai would have been rewarded for his zeal; but somehow or other it happened that his services were overlooked he was neither promoted from his humble office, nor did he receive any gift (<a href="/esther/6-3.htm">Esther 6:3</a>). This was quite contrary to ordinary Persian practice; but the court generally may have disliked Mordecai because he was a Jew. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/esther/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Before relating the appearance of Esther before the king, the narrator more particularly describes in <a href="//biblehub.com/esther/2-12.htm">Esther 2:12-14</a> the preparations for this event, and how Esther behaved with respect to them.<p><a href="//biblehub.com/esther/2-12.htm">Esther 2:12-13</a><p>"When every maid's turn came (i.e., at every time that any maid's turn came) to go in to King Ahashverosh, after the time when it had been done to her twelve months according to the law of the women - for thus were the days of their purification accomplished: six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with balsam and ointments of purification for women - and the maiden came to the king, all that she desired was given her to go with her out of the women's house unto the king's house." &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;, turn in succession, used only here and <a href="/esther/2-15.htm">Esther 2:15</a>.

Either view is admissible and suits the sense, but the latter is more in harmony with the parallel passage <a href="//biblehub.com/esther/4-16.htm">Esther 4:16</a>, and therefore preferable. All that was to be given her, can only relate to ornaments and jewels, which were to be given that each might appear before the king adorned and dressed after her own taste.</body></html>
