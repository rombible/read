Esther was preferred as queen. Those who suggest that Esther committed sin to come at this dignity, do not consider the custom of those times and countries. Every one that the king took was married to him, and was his wife, though of a lower rank. But how low is human nature sunk, when such as these are the leading pursuits and highest worldly happiness of men! Disappointment and vexation must follow; and he most wisely consults his enjoyment, even in this present life, who most exactly obeys the precepts of the Divine law. But let us turn to consider the wise and merciful providence of God, carrying on his deep but holy designs in the midst of all this. And let no change in our condition be a pretext for forgetting our duties to parents, or the friends who have stood in their place.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/esther/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Mordecai, the eunuch <a href="//biblehub.com/esther/2-7.htm">Esther 2:7</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/esther/2-11.htm">Esther 2:11</a>, has been conjectured to be the same as Matacas, who, according to Ctesias, was the most powerful of the eunuchs during the latter portion of the reign of Xerxes. Mordecai's line of descent is traced from a certain Kish, carried off by Nebuchadnezzar in 598 B.C. - the year of Jeconiah's captivity - who was his great-grandfather. The four generations, Kish, Shimei, Jair, Mordecai, correspond to the known generations in other cases, for example:<p>High priests kings of Persia Royal stock of Judah  Seraiah Cambyses Jeconiah  Jozadak Cyrus Salathiel  Jeshua Darius Zerubbabel  Joiakim Xerxes Hananiah  <p>The age of Mordecai at the accession of Xerxes may probably have been about 30 or 40; that of Esther, his first cousin, about 20. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/esther/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. Now in Shushan the palace there was a certain Jew&#8212;Mordecai held some office about the court. But his "sitting at the king's gate" (Es 2:21) does not necessarily imply that he was in the humble condition of a porter; for, according to an institute of Cyrus, all state officers were required to wait in the outer courts till they were summoned into the presence chamber. He might, therefore, have been a person of some official dignity. This man had an orphan cousin, born during the exile, under his care, who being distinguished by great personal beauty, was one of the young damsels taken into the royal harem on this occasion. She had the good fortune at once to gain the good will of the chief eunuch [Es 2:9]. Her sweet and amiable appearance made her a favorite with all who looked upon her (Es 2:15, last clause). Her Hebrew name (Es 2:7) was Hadassah, that is, "myrtle," which, on her introduction into the royal harem, was changed to Esther, that is, the star Venus, indicating beauty and good fortune [Gesenius].<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/esther/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Who had been carried away:</span> this may be referred either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

If, however, he was even as a boy one of the captives in the time of Jeconiah (Jehoiachin, <a href="/2_kings/24-6.htm" title="So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers: and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead.">2 Kings 24:6</a>), b.c. 598, and if, as we have seen, Ahasuerus is to be identified with Xerxes, Mordecai’s age would be something like 120 years, while his cousin Esther must also have been much too old. To get rid of this difficulty (which would only be diminished, not removed, if we were to adopt the otherwise very improbable view that an earlier ruler than Xerxes is intended), it has been sought, in contravention of the grammatical usage of the original, to make the antecedent to be not Mordecai but Kish, taken as the name of the great-grandfather of the former, and as otherwise unknown. But the true explanation doubtless is that the chronological difficulty never occurred to the framer of the story, nor, probably, to his earliest readers, and that he simply meant to represent Mordecai as one of the Jews in exile.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">whom Nebuchadnezzar etc.</span>] See <a href="/2_kings/24-10.htm" title="At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against Jerusalem, and the city was besieged.">2 Kings 24:10</a> ff.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/esther/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who had been carried away</span>.

He sent letters into all his provinces to make known his commands, and to let all husbands know, that they were to bear rule in their own houses. "In every province according to its writing, and to every people according to their speech" (comp. <a href="/esther/8-9.htm">Esther 8:9</a>), that his will might be clearly understood by all the subjects of his wide domain, who spoke different languages and used different alphabetical characters. The contents of these letters follow in &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514;, that every man should be master in his own house. These words state only the chief matter and object of the edict; but they presuppose that the fact which gave rise to the decree, viz., the refusal of Vashti, and her consequent deposition, were also mentioned. The last words: "and that he shall speak according to the language of his people," are obscure. Older expositors understand them to mean, that every man was to speak only his native language in his house, so that in case he had a foreign wife, or several who spoke other languages, they might be obliged to learn his language, and to use that alone. Bertheau, on the other hand, objects that such a sense is but imported into the words, and in no wise harmonizes with the context. Both these assertions are, however, unfounded. In the words, the man shall speak according to the language of his people, i.e., he shall speak his native tongue in his house, it is implied that no other language was to be used in the house, and the application of this law to foreign wives is obvious from the context. The rule of the husband in the house was to be shown by the fact, that only the native tongue of the head of the house was to be used in the family. Thus in a Jewish family the Ashdodite or any other language of the wife's native land could not have been used, as we find to have been the case in Judaea (<a href="/nehemiah/13-23.htm">Nehemiah 13:23</a>). All other explanations are untenable, as has been already shown by Baumgarten, p. 20; and the conjecture set up after Hitzig by Bertheau, that instead of &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503; we should read &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1492;, every one shall speak what becomes him, gives not only a trivial, and not at all an appropriate thought, but is refuted even by the fact that not &#1506;&#1501; &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1492;, but only &#1500; &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1492; (comp. <a href="/esther/3-8.htm">Esther 3:8</a>) could bear the meaning: to be becoming to any one. Such a command may, indeed, appear strange to us; but the additional particular, that every man was to speak his native tongue, and to have it alone spoken, in his own house, is not so strange as the fact itself that an edict should be issued commanding that the husband should be master in the house, especially in the East, where the wife is so accustomed to regard the husband as lord and master. Xerxes was, however, the author of many strange facts besides this. </body></html>
