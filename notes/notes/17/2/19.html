The king “loved Esther above all the women,” but how the word “love “is degraded in this connection is seen by the fact that after she had been his wife certainly less (possibly much less) than five years, there takes place a second gathering of virgins (there is no article in the Hebrew), like the one previously mentioned (<a href="/esther/2-2.htm" title="Then said the king's servants that ministered to him, Let there be fair young virgins sought for the king:">Esther 2:2</a>).

See Le Clerc. Mordecai has been thought by some to have been one of the porters of the royal palace; but it is probable he was an officer of higher rank. Poole thinks he was one of the king’s guard, or ministers, and that he had been advanced to this place by Esther’s favour, though without any discovery of her relation to him.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/esther/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:1-20 We see to what absurd practices those came, who were destitute of Divine revelation, and what need there was of the gospel of Christ, to purify men from the lusts of the flesh, and to bring them back to the original institution of marriage. Esther was preferred as queen. Those who suggest that Esther committed sin to come at this dignity, do not consider the custom of those times and countries. Every one that the king took was married to him, and was his wife, though of a lower rank. But how low is human nature sunk, when such as these are the leading pursuits and highest worldly happiness of men! Disappointment and vexation must follow; and he most wisely consults his enjoyment, even in this present life, who most exactly obeys the precepts of the Divine law. But let us turn to consider the wise and merciful providence of God, carrying on his deep but holy designs in the midst of all this. And let no change in our condition be a pretext for forgetting our duties to parents, or the friends who have stood in their place.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/esther/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>When the virgins ... - Rather, "when virgins" etc. The words begin a new paragraph. There was a second collection of virgins (after that of <a href="/esther/2-8.htm">Esther 2:8</a>), and it was at the time of this second collection that Mordecai had the good fortune to save the king's life. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/esther/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17. the king loved Esther above all the women&#8212;The choice fell on Esther, who found favor in the eyes of Ahasuerus. He elevated her to the dignity of chief wife, or queen. The other competitors had apartments assigned them in the royal harem, and were retained in the rank of secondary wives, of whom Oriental princes have a great number.<p>he set the royal crown upon her head&#8212;This consisted only of a purple ribbon, streaked with white, bound round the forehead. The nuptials were celebrated by a magnificent entertainment, and, in honor of the auspicious occasion, "he made a release to the provinces, and gave gifts, according to the state of the king." The dotation of Persian queens consisted in consigning to them the revenue of certain cities, in various parts of the kingdom, for defraying their personal and domestic expenditure. Some of these imposts the king remitted or lessened at this time.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/esther/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The second time; </span> either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

Since Esther was declared queen; for though that point was determined, the king’s lust was not yet satisfied; and therefore being pleased with the former experiment, he desired another collection of virgins, whom he might make his concubines. And this seems best to agree with the following words. For it is not probable that Mordecai sat at the king’s gate till Esther was queen; for till then he only walked before the court of the women’s house, as is expressed, <span class="bld"><a href="/esther/2-11.htm" title="And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women's house, to know how Esther did, and what should become of her.">Esther 2:11</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Mordecai sat in the king’s gate; </span> either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

Some think this second collection is that which was made when Esther was taken and brought to the keeper of the women, called the second, in reference to a former collection of them, made when Vashti was taken and made queen; but as there is no proof of any such collection then made, rather the case was this, such was the lust of the king, though he had a queen he loved, and a multitude of concubine's, yet a second collection of virgins was made for his gratification: <p>then Mordecai sat in the king's gate; or court, being an officer in it, promoted by the interest of Esther, though not as yet known to be a relation of her's: so in Xenophon (z) is used of the court of the king of Persia, as the Ottoman or Turkish court is now called the "Porte". <p>(z) Cyropaedia, l. 8. c. 2, 5, 11, 40. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/esther/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And when the virgins were gathered together the <span class="cverse3">{m}</span> second time, then Mordecai sat in the king's gate.</span><p>(m) That is, at the marriage of Esther, which was the second marriage for the king.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/esther/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>19–23.

There is no article attached to the word ‘virgins’ in the original, and we have no means of knowing what kind of occasion is referred to here.

The clause is omitted in the LXX.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">then Mordecai sat etc.</span>] better, perhaps, <span class="ital">and when Mordecai was sitting etc.</span> In this way we have another circumstantial clause, which is added to the first, and resumed in <span class="ital"><a href="/esther/2-21.htm" title="In those days, while Mordecai sat in the king's gate, two of the king's chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those which kept the door, were wroth, and sought to lay hands on the king Ahasuerus.">Esther 2:21</a></span>. Mordecai occupied a place at the gate of the palace properly so called, or of that division of the women’s apartments which was assigned to the queen herself (see on <span class="ital"><a href="/esther/2-3.htm" title="And let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the fair young virgins to Shushan the palace, to the house of the women, to the custody of Hege the king's chamberlain, keeper of the women; and let their things for purification be given them:">Esther 2:3</a></span>), that he might utilise any opportunity which presented itself of communicating with his ward.

Then Mordecai sat, etc. The three verses, 19, 20, 21, hang together, and form a single sentence: "When virgins were gathered together a second time, and Mordecai was sitting in the king's gate - now Esther had not showed her kindred or her people, as Mordecai had charged her; for Esther did the command of Mordecai like as when she was brought up with him - in those days, while Mordecai sat in the king's gate, Bigthan and Teresh, two of the king's eunuchs, being of the number of them which kept the threshold, were wroth," etc. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/esther/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Before relating the appearance of Esther before the king, the narrator more particularly describes in <a href="//biblehub.com/esther/2-12.htm">Esther 2:12-14</a> the preparations for this event, and how Esther behaved with respect to them.<p><a href="//biblehub.com/esther/2-12.htm">Esther 2:12-13</a><p>"When every maid's turn came (i.e., at every time that any maid's turn came) to go in to King Ahashverosh, after the time when it had been done to her twelve months according to the law of the women - for thus were the days of their purification accomplished: six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with balsam and ointments of purification for women - and the maiden came to the king, all that she desired was given her to go with her out of the women's house unto the king's house." &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;, turn in succession, used only here and <a href="/esther/2-15.htm">Esther 2:15</a>.

Either view is admissible and suits the sense, but the latter is more in harmony with the parallel passage <a href="//biblehub.com/esther/4-16.htm">Esther 4:16</a>, and therefore preferable.
