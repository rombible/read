Esther was preferred as queen. Those who suggest that Esther committed sin to come at this dignity, do not consider the custom of those times and countries. Every one that the king took was married to him, and was his wife, though of a lower rank. But how low is human nature sunk, when such as these are the leading pursuits and highest worldly happiness of men! Disappointment and vexation must follow; and he most wisely consults his enjoyment, even in this present life, who most exactly obeys the precepts of the Divine law. But let us turn to consider the wise and merciful providence of God, carrying on his deep but holy designs in the midst of all this. And let no change in our condition be a pretext for forgetting our duties to parents, or the friends who have stood in their place.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/esther/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Hadassah, &#1492;&#1491;&#1505;&#1492;  ha&#774;dassa&#770;h from &#1492;&#1491;&#1505;  ha&#774;das ("myrtle") would seem to have been the Hebrew, and Esther the Persian, name of the damsel.

Now in Shushan the palace there was a certain Jew&#8212;Mordecai held some office about the court. But his "sitting at the king's gate" (Es 2:21) does not necessarily imply that he was in the humble condition of a porter; for, according to an institute of Cyrus, all state officers were required to wait in the outer courts till they were summoned into the presence chamber. He might, therefore, have been a person of some official dignity. This man had an orphan cousin, born during the exile, under his care, who being distinguished by great personal beauty, was one of the young damsels taken into the royal harem on this occasion. She had the good fortune at once to gain the good will of the chief eunuch [Es 2:9]. Her sweet and amiable appearance made her a favorite with all who looked upon her (Es 2:15, last clause). Her Hebrew name (Es 2:7) was Hadassah, that is, "myrtle," which, on her introduction into the royal harem, was changed to Esther, that is, the star Venus, indicating beauty and good fortune [Gesenius].<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/esther/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The maiden pleased him; </span> partly because she was very beautiful, and therefore he supposed she would be very acceptable to the king, which would be his advantage; and partly by the Divine Power, which moveth the hearts of men which way he pleaseth. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/esther/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the maiden pleased him,....

The reference is not to unguents of any kind, but to special food given as part of the preparation of those who were to be admitted to the king. So Nebuchadnezzar appointed for the youths who were to ‘stand before the king’ (<a href="/daniel/1-5.htm" title="And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king's meat, and of the wine which he drank: so nourishing them three years, that at the end thereof they might stand before the king.">Daniel 1:5</a>) a daily portion of the king’s dainties and of the wine which he drank.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and the seven maidens</span>] The article (wrongly omitted in the A.V.) indicates that it was the custom to assign seven attendants or maids of honour to persons in Esther’s position as candidates for the king’s favour.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">which were meet to be given her</span>] suitable to her exceptional claims on the ground of her beauty.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and he removed etc.</span>] A.V. has <span class="ital">and he preferred etc.</span> In this sense, viz. to advance, promote, the verb (occurring also in A.V. of <a href="/daniel/6-3.htm" title="Then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes, because an excellent spirit was in him; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm.">Daniel 6:3</a>; <a href="/john/1-15.htm" title="John bore witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spoke, He that comes after me is preferred before me: for he was before me.">John 1:15</a>; <a href="/john/1-27.htm" title="He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe's lace I am not worthy to unloose.">John 1:27</a>) is now but little used, although the substantive <span class="ital">preferment</span> has held its ground in common parlance.

If it be an actual Greek word, it properly means <span class="ital">graceful, delicate</span>, but in the sense in which it is here used, it may be of foreign origin. Elsewhere it is used of the attendants upon Pharaoh’s daughter (<a href="/exodus/2-5.htm" title="And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river's side; and when she saw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it.">Exodus 2:5</a>), also of Judith’s maid (<a href="/judges/8-33.htm" title="And it came to pass, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the children of Israel turned again, and went a whoring after Baalim, and made Baalberith their god.">Jdg 8:33</a>), and again in this Book (<a href="/esther/4-4.htm" title="So Esther's maids and her chamberlains came and told it her.

This is a phrase peculiar to the Book of Esther, and a favourite one with the author (see vers. 15, 17; and <a href="/esther/5-2.htm">Esther 5:2</a>).

To prevent, then, a return of affection for his rejected wife ensuing, - a circumstance which might greatly endanger all who had concurred in effecting her repudiation, - the servants of the king, i.e., the court officials who were about him, said: "Let there be young maidens, virgins fair to look on, sought for the king." &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514;, virgins, is added to &#1504;&#1506;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, the latter word signifying merely young women of marriageable age. <a href="/esther/2-3.htm">Esther 2:3</a>.

Hega (called Hegai, <a href="/esther/2-8.htm">Esther 2:8</a> and <a href="/esther/2-15.htm">Esther 2:15</a>) was an eunuch, the keeper of the women, i.e., superintendent of the royal harem. &#1493;&#1504;&#1514;&#1493;&#1503; is the infin. abs., used instead of the verb. fin. to give prominence to the matter: let them appoint. &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1512;&#1511;&#1493;&#1501;, from &#1502;&#1512;&#1511;, to rub, to polish, signifies purification and adornment with all kind of precious ointments; comp. <a href="/esther/2-12.htm">Esther 2:12</a>.
