Their sympathies, too, were clearly with the Jews and against Haman. (See <a href="/esther/8-15.htm" title="And Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and with a garment of fine linen and purple: and the city of Shushan rejoiced and was glad.">Esther 8:15</a>.)<p><span class= "bld"><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/esther/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:7-15 Without some acquaintance with the human heart, and the history of mankind, we should not think that any prince could consent to a dreadful proposal, so hurtful to himself. Let us be thankful for mild and just government. Haman inquires, according to his own superstitions, how to find a lucky day for the designed massacre! God's wisdom serves its own purposes by men's folly. Haman has appealed to the lot, and the lot, by delaying the execution, gives judgment against him. The event explains the doctrine of a particular providence over all the affairs of men, and the care of God over his church. Haman was afraid lest the king's conscience should smite him for what he had done; to prevent which, he kept him drinking. This cursed method many often take to drown convictions, and to harden their own hearts, and the hearts of others, in sin. All appeared in a favourable train to accomplish the project. But though sinners are permitted to proceed to the point they aim at, an unseen but almighty Power turns them back. How vain and contemptible are the strongest assaults against Jehovah! Had Haman obtained his wish, and the Jewish nation perished, what must have become of all the promises? How could the prophecies concerning the great Redeemer of the world have been fulfilled? Thus the everlasting covenant itself must have failed, before this diabolical project could take place.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/esther/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Shushan was perplexed - Susa was now the capital of Persia, and the main residence of the Persians of high rank. These, being attached to the religion of Zoroaster, would naturally sympathize with the Jews, and be disturbed at their threatened destruction. Even apart from this bond of union, the decree was sufficiently strange and ominous to "perplex" thoughtful citizens. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/esther/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15. the king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city Shushan was perplexed&#8212;The completeness of the word-painting in this verse is exquisite. The historian, by a simple stroke, has drawn a graphic picture of an Oriental despot, wallowing with his favorite in sensual enjoyments, while his tyrannical cruelties were rending the hearts and homes of thousands of his subjects.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/esther/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">By the king’s commandment; </span> either by this decree made in the king’s name, or by some particular and succeeding command, which Haman could easily obtain from the king. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The city Shushan was perplexed; </span> not only the Jews, but a great number of the citizens, either because they were related to them, or engaged with them in worldly concerns; or out of humanity and compassion towards so vast a number of innocent people, now appointed as sheep for the slaughter; or out of a fear either of some sedition and disturbance which might arise by this means; or of some damage which might accrue to themselves or friends, who haply under this pretence might be exposed to rapine or slaughter; or of a public judgment of God upon them all for so bloody a decree. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/esther/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>The post went out, being hastened by the king's command,....

Though there was ample time, since the remotest part of the empire could be reached in a month, or two at the most, yet the posts were "hastened," Haman being impatient, lest the king should change his mind, and decline to publish the edict. The king may himself also have wished to have the matter settled past recall<span class="cmt_word">. The king sat down with Haman to drink.</span> This touch seems intended to mark their hardness of heart. As Nero "fiddled while Rome was burning," so these two, having assigned a nation to destruction, proceeded to enjoy themselves at "a banquet of wine." <span class="cmt_word">But the city of Susa was perplexed</span>. The Jews had enemies in Susa (<a href="/esther/9-12.htm">Esther 9:12-15</a>); but the bulk of the inhabitants being Persians, and so Zoroastrians, would be likely to sympathise with them. There might also be a widespread feeling among persons of other nationalities that the precedent now set was a dangerous one. Generally the people of the capital approved and applauded what. ever the great king did. Now they misdoubted the justice, and perhaps even the prudence, of what was resolved upon. The decree threw them into perplexity. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/esther/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Haman having by means of the lot fixed upon a favourable day for the execution of the massacre, betook himself to the king to obtain a royal decree for the purpose. He represented to the monarch: "There is a people scattered abroad and dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of thy kingdom, and their laws are different from all other people (i.e., from the laws of all other people), and they keep not the laws of the king, and it is not fitting for the king to leave them alone. <a href="/esther/3-9.htm">Esther 3:9</a>. If it seem good to the king, let it be written (i.e., let a written decree be published) to destroy them; and I will weigh ten thousand talents of silver to those who do the business, that they may bring them into the treasuries of the king." This proposal was very subtilly calculated. First Haman casts suspicion on the Jews as a nation scattered abroad and dwelling apart, and therefore unsociable, - as refractory, and therefore dangerous to the state; then he promises the king that their extermination will bring into the royal treasury a very considerable sum of money, viz., the property of the slaughtered. Ten thousand talents of silver, reckoned according to the Mosaic shekel, are 3,750,000, according to the civil shekel 1,875,000; see rem. on <a href="/1_chronicles/22-14.htm">1 Chronicles 22:14</a>. &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;&#1499;&#1492; &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;, those who execute a work, builders in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/12-12.htm">2 Kings 12:12</a>, are here and <a href="/esther/9-3.htm">Esther 9:3</a> the king's men of business, who carry on the king's business with respect to receipts and disbursements, the royal financiers.</body></html>
