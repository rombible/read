Let us be thankful for mild and just government. Haman inquires, according to his own superstitions, how to find a lucky day for the designed massacre! God's wisdom serves its own purposes by men's folly. Haman has appealed to the lot, and the lot, by delaying the execution, gives judgment against him. The event explains the doctrine of a particular providence over all the affairs of men, and the care of God over his church. Haman was afraid lest the king's conscience should smite him for what he had done; to prevent which, he kept him drinking. This cursed method many often take to drown convictions, and to harden their own hearts, and the hearts of others, in sin. All appeared in a favourable train to accomplish the project. But though sinners are permitted to proceed to the point they aim at, an unseen but almighty Power turns them back. How vain and contemptible are the strongest assaults against Jehovah! Had Haman obtained his wish, and the Jewish nation perished, what must have become of all the promises? How could the prophecies concerning the great Redeemer of the world have been fulfilled? Thus the everlasting covenant itself must have failed, before this diabolical project could take place.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/esther/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>On the thirteenth day - Haman had, apparently (compare <a href="/esther/3-7.htm">Esther 3:7</a> with <a href="/esther/3-13.htm">Esther 3:13</a>), obtained by his use of the lot the 13th day of Adar as the lucky day for destroying the Jews. This may have caused him to fix on the 13th day of another month for the commencement of his enterprise. So, the Jews throughout the empire had from 9 to 11 months of warning of the peril which threatened them. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/esther/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12-15.

It was translated into the dialects of all the people throughout the vast empire, and swift messengers were sent to carry it into all the provinces. On the day appointed, all Jews were to be put to death and their property confiscated; doubtless, the means by which Haman hoped to pay his stipulated tribute into the royal treasury. To us it appears unaccountable how any sane monarch could have given his consent to the extirpation of a numerous class of his subjects. But such acts of frenzied barbarity have, alas! been not rarely authorized by careless and voluptuous despots, who have allowed their ears to be engrossed and their policy directed by haughty and selfish minions, who had their own passions to gratify, their own ends to serve.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/esther/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Then were the king’s scribes called:</span> this he did so speedily, though it was a year before the intended execution, lest the king should change his mind, either by his own clemency, or by the persuasion of others. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/esther/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then were the king's scribes called, on the thirteenth day of the first month,....
