If they had attempted nothing against the people of God, they would not themselves have suffered. The Jews, acting together, strengthened one another. Let us learn to stand fast in one spirit, and with one mind, striving together against the enemies of our souls, who endeavour to rob us of our faith, which is more precious than our lives. The Jews, to the honour of their religion, showed contempt of wordly wealth, that they might make it appear they desired nothing except their own preservation. In every case the people of God should manifest humanity and disinterestedness, frequently refusing advantages which might lawfully be obtained. The Jews celebrated their festival the day after they had finished their work. When we have received great mercies from God, we ought to be speedy in making thankful returns to him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/esther/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>All the rulers ... helped the Jews - i. e. the Persians, who formed the standing army which kept the Empire in subjection, and were at the disposal of the various governors of provinces, took the Jews' side. The enemies of the Jews (e. g. <a href="/esther/9-16.htm">Esther 9:16</a>) were almost entirely to be found among the idolatrous people of the subject nations, for whose lives neither the Persians generally, nor their monarchs, cared greatly. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/esther/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2.

"And it was written according to all that Mordochai commanded." They were sent to the Jews and to the satraps, etc., of the whole wide realm from India to Ethiopia (see <a href="/esther/1-1.htm">Esther 1:1</a>), while those of Haman had been issued only to the satraps, etc. The rest coincides with <a href="/esther/3-12.htm">Esther 3:12</a>. &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1499;&#1514;&#1468;&#1489;, and he (Mordochai) wrote. To show the speed with which the letters were despatched, (messengers) "on horseback, on coursers, government coursers, the sons of the stud," is added to &#1492;&#1512;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491;. &#1512;&#1499;&#1513;&#1473; is a collective, meaning swift horses, coursers; comp. <a href="/1_kings/5-8.htm">1 Kings 5:8</a>. &#1488;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; (<a href="/esther/8-11.htm">Esther 8:11</a> and <a href="/esther/8-14.htm">Esther 8:14</a>) answers to the Old-Persian kschatrana, from kschatra, government, king, and means government, royal, or court studs. So Haug in Ewald's bibl. Jahrb. v. p. 154. The older explanation, mules, on the other hand, is founded on the modern Persian estar, which, to judge from the Sanscrit avatara, must in ancient Persian have been apatara. &#1512;&#1502;&#1468;&#1499;&#1497;&#1501;, &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. from &#1512;&#1502;&#1468;&#1498;, answering to the Syriac remakaa', herd, especially a herd of horses, and to the Arabic ramaka, stud, is explained by Bertheau as a superlative form for the animal who excels the rest of the herd of stud in activity, perhaps the breeding stallion, while others understand it of the stud in general. The contents of the edict follow in <a href="/esther/8-11.htm">Esther 8:11</a> and <a href="/esther/8-12.htm">Esther 8:12</a> : "that the king allows the Jews in every city to assemble and to stand for their life (i.e., to fight for their lives, comp. <a href="/daniel/12-1.htm">Daniel 12:1</a>), to destroy, to slay, and to cause to perish all the power (&#1495;&#1497;&#1500;, military power) of the people and province that should assault them, children and women, and to plunder their property, upon a certain day," etc. The appointed time is thus stated as in <a href="/esther/3-13.htm">Esther 3:13</a>. The Jews were thus authorized to attack and destroy all enemies who should assault them on the day appointed for their extermination. <a href="/esther/8-13.htm">Esther 8:13</a> coincides with <a href="//biblehub.com/esther/3-14.htm">Esther 3:14</a>, with this difference, that the Jews are to be ready on this day to avenge themselves on their enemies. <a href="/esther/8-14.htm">Esther 8:14</a> also is similar to <a href="//biblehub.com/esther/3-15.htm">Esther 3:15</a>, except that the expression is strengthened by an addition to &#1492;&#1512;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501; as in <a href="//biblehub.com/esther/8-10.htm">Esther 8:10</a>, and by that of &#1491;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1497;&#1501;, urged on, to &#1502;&#1489;&#1492;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, hastened, to point out the utmost despatch possible. </body></html>
