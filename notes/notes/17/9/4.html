If they had attempted nothing against the people of God, they would not themselves have suffered. The Jews, acting together, strengthened one another. Let us learn to stand fast in one spirit, and with one mind, striving together against the enemies of our souls, who endeavour to rob us of our faith, which is more precious than our lives. The Jews, to the honour of their religion, showed contempt of wordly wealth, that they might make it appear they desired nothing except their own preservation. In every case the people of God should manifest humanity and disinterestedness, frequently refusing advantages which might lawfully be obtained. The Jews celebrated their festival the day after they had finished their work. When we have received great mercies from God, we ought to be speedy in making thankful returns to him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/esther/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>All the rulers ... helped the Jews - i. e. the Persians, who formed the standing army which kept the Empire in subjection, and were at the disposal of the various governors of provinces, took the Jews' side. The enemies of the Jews (e. g. <a href="/esther/9-16.htm">Esther 9:16</a>) were almost entirely to be found among the idolatrous people of the subject nations, for whose lives neither the Persians generally, nor their monarchs, cared greatly. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/esther/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. The Jews gathered themselves &#8230; no man could withstand them&#8212;The tables were now turned in their favor; and though their enemies made their long meditated attack, the Jews were not only at liberty to act on the defensive, but through the powerful influence enlisted on their side at court together with the blessing of God, they were everywhere victorious.<p>the fear of them fell upon all people&#8212;This impression arose not alone from the consciousness of the all-powerful vizier being their countryman, but from the hand of God appearing so visibly interposed to effect their strange and unexpected deliverance.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/esther/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Mordecai was great, </span> i.e. the greatest in place, and power, and favour with the king, both for his near relation to his beloved queen, and for his good service done to him in preserving his life and managing his affairs, and for those excellent abilities and virtues which he discovered in him, and especially by the disposition of the heart-ruling God. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/esther/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For Mordecai was great in the king's house,....

After transacting with the king this measure so favourable to the Jews, Mordochai went out from the king in a garment of deep blue and white material (comp. <a href="/esther/1-6.htm">Esther 1:6</a>), and with a great crown of gold, and a mantle of byssus and purple. &#1514;&#1468;&#1499;&#1512;&#1497;&#1498;, &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;., in the Aramaean &#1514;&#1468;&#1499;&#1512;&#1497;&#1499;&#1488;, a wide mantle or covering. The meaning is not, as Bertheau remarks, that he left the king in the garment which had been, according to <a href="/esther/6-8.htm">Esther 6:8</a>., presented to him, nor that he left him with fresh tokens of his favour, clothed in a garment, crown, and mantle just bestowed on him, but that he left him in a magnificent state garment, and otherwise festally apparelled, that he might thus show, even by his external appearance, the happiness of his heart. Of these remarks, the first and last are quite correct; the second, however, can by no means be so, because it affords no answer to the question how Mordochai had obtained crown and mantle during his stay with the king and in the royal palace. The garments in which Mordochai left the king are evidently the state garments of the first minister, which Mordochai received at his installation to his office, and, as such, no fresh token of royal favour, but only his actual induction in his new dignity, and a sign of this induction to all who saw him issue from the palace so adorned. "The city of Susa rejoiced and was glad," i.e., rejoiced for gladness. The city, i.e., its inhabitants on the whole.</body></html>
