If they had attempted nothing against the people of God, they would not themselves have suffered. The Jews, acting together, strengthened one another. Let us learn to stand fast in one spirit, and with one mind, striving together against the enemies of our souls, who endeavour to rob us of our faith, which is more precious than our lives. The Jews, to the honour of their religion, showed contempt of wordly wealth, that they might make it appear they desired nothing except their own preservation. In every case the people of God should manifest humanity and disinterestedness, frequently refusing advantages which might lawfully be obtained. The Jews celebrated their festival the day after they had finished their work.

Thus the Jews smote all their enemies&#8212;The effect of the two antagonistic decrees was, in the meantime, to raise a fierce and bloody war between the Jews and their enemies throughout the Persian empire; but through the dread of Esther and Mordecai, the provincial governors universally favored their cause, so that their enemies fell in great numbers.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/esther/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">In Shushan the palace, </span> i.e. in the city so called, as was noted before, <span class="bld"><a href="/esther/1-2.htm" title="That in those days, when the king Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom, which was in Shushan the palace,">Esther 1:2</a></span>; it not being probable either that they would make such a slaughter in the king’s palace, or that they would be suffered so to do. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Five hundred men; </span> whom by long experience they knew to be their constant and inveterate enemies, and such as would watch all opportunities to destroy them; which also they might possibly now attempt to do.

Not in the royal palace, where it cannot be thought the Jews had so many enemies, or such a bloody slaughter of them should be made there; but in the city, where the palace was: and this may seem somewhat wonderful, that there should so many rise there against the Jews, so near the court, now altogether in the interest of the Jews; but these were men no doubt of Haman's faction, and enraged at his disgrace and death, and headed by his ten sons, who took the advantage of the decree to avenge his death; the Targum says, these were princes of the house of Amalek. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/esther/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And in Shushan the palace the Jews slew and destroyed <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> five hundred men.</span><p>(d) Besides the three hundred that they slew the second day, Es 9:15.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/esther/9.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>. <span class="ital">in Shushan the palace</span>] The word seems to have a somewhat wider sense here than earlier in the Book (see note on <a href="/esther/1-2.htm" title="That in those days, when the king Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom, which was in Shushan the palace,">Esther 1:2</a>), meaning perhaps <span class="ital">royal city</span>.

This conversion of many of the heathen to Judaism must not be explained only, as by Clericus and Grotius, of a change of religion on the part of the heathen, ut sibi hoc modo securitatem et reginae favorem pararent, metuentes potentiam Mardechaei. This may have been the inducement with some of the inhabitants of Susa. But the majority certainly acted from more honourable motives, viz., a conviction, forced upon them by the unexpected turn of affairs in favour of the Jews, of the truth of the Jewish religion; and the power of that faith and trust in God manifested by the Jews, and so evidently justified by the fall of Haman and the promotion of Mordochai, contrasted with the vanity and misery of polytheism, to which even the heathen themselves were not blind. When we consider that the same motives in subsequent times, when the Jews as a nation were in a state of deepest humiliation, attracted the more earnest-minded of the heathen to the Jewish religion, and induced them to become proselytes, the fact here related will not appear surprising. </body></html>
