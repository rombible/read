If they had attempted nothing against the people of God, they would not themselves have suffered. The Jews, acting together, strengthened one another. Let us learn to stand fast in one spirit, and with one mind, striving together against the enemies of our souls, who endeavour to rob us of our faith, which is more precious than our lives. The Jews, to the honour of their religion, showed contempt of wordly wealth, that they might make it appear they desired nothing except their own preservation. In every case the people of God should manifest humanity and disinterestedness, frequently refusing advantages which might lawfully be obtained. The Jews celebrated their festival the day after they had finished their work. When we have received great mercies from God, we ought to be speedy in making thankful returns to him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/esther/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>On the spoil laid they not their hand - As they might have done (see the margin reference). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/esther/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5-16. Thus the Jews smote all their enemies&#8212;The effect of the two antagonistic decrees was, in the meantime, to raise a fierce and bloody war between the Jews and their enemies throughout the Persian empire; but through the dread of Esther and Mordecai, the provincial governors universally favored their cause, so that their enemies fell in great numbers.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/esther/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Possibly with evil design to incense thee king against the Jews. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/esther/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>On that day the number of those that were slain in Shushan the palace was brought before the king.

It was customary in all wars for the number of the slain to be carefully made out and recorded. In the Babylonian transcript of the Behistun Inscription the numbers are given with extreme exactness - e.g. 546, 2024, 4203, etc. On this occasion it would seem that only a rough calculation was made. Still the king took care to be informed on the subject, and the Jews, aware of this, were not left absolutely uncontrolled. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/esther/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Thus supported, the Jews inflicted defeat upon their enemies with the sword, and with slaughter and destruction. &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492; with &#1489;&#1468;, to deal a blow upon or against some one, to cause or bring about upon enemies a defeat; comp. e.g., <a href="/2_samuel/23-10.htm">2 Samuel 23:10</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/24-17.htm">2 Samuel 24:17</a>; <a href="/numbers/22-6.htm">Numbers 22:6</a>.
