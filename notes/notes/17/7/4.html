Happily for her, God has willed that these, perhaps at any other time untrustworthy grounds of reliance, shall suffice.

She makes use of these several words, to express the utter destruction of her and her people, without any exception; not only the more to impress the king's mind with it, but she has respect to the precise words of the decree, <a href="/esther/3-13.htm">Esther 3:13</a> as she has also to the 10,000 talents of silver Haman offered to pay the king for the grant of it, when she says, "we are sold", or delivered to be destroyed: <p>but if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen, I had held my tongue: should never have asked for deliverance from bondage, but have patiently submitted to it, however unreasonable, unjust, and afflictive it would have been; because it might have been borne, and there might be hope of deliverance from it at one time or another; though it is said, slaves with the Persians were never made free (g); but that being the case would not have been so great a loss to the king, who would have reaped some advantage by their servitude; whereas, by the death of them, he must sustain a loss which the enemy was not equal to, and which he could not compensate with all his riches; which, according to Ben Melech, is the sense of the next clause: <p>although the enemy could not countervail the king's damage; or, "for the enemy cannot", &amp;c. the 10,000 talents offered by him, and all the riches that he has, are not an equivalent to the loss the king would sustain by the death of such a multitude of people, from whom he received so large a tribute; but this the enemy regarded not; and so Jarchi interprets it, the enemy took no care of, or was concerned about the king's damage; but there is another sense, which Aben Ezra mentions, and is followed by some learned men, who take the word for "enemy" to signify "distress", trouble, and anguish, as in <a href="/psalms/4-1.htm">Psalm 4:1</a> and read the words, "for this distress would not be reckoned the king's damage" (h), or loss; though it would have been a distress to the Jews to have been sold for slaves, yet the loss to the king would not be so great as their death, since he would receive benefit by their service. <p>(g) Alex. ab.

The R.V. makes good sense, as meaning that Haman, by enslaving the Jews, would do the king an injury (by depriving him of the persons of so many of his subjects and of the revenues derived from them) for which it would be out of his power to make compensation. The fatal objection to this rendering is that it is impossible as a translation of the Heb. as it stands, inasmuch as the word rendered ‘although’ cannot have that sense, but must be rendered <span class="ital">for</span>, or <span class="ital">because</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The margin of the R.V., retaining the Heb. consonants as they stand while slightly changing a vowel[74] (<span class="ital">for our affliction is not to be compared with the king’s damage</span>), means, ‘the suffering which would be inflicted on us is a trivial matter compared with the loss to the king.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[74] Reading <span class="greekheb">הַצַּר</span> for <span class="greekheb">הַצָּר</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Other translations are (<span class="ital">a</span>) (keeping the same change of vowel in the Heb.) ‘for such oppression would not be worth troubling the king about,’ or (<span class="ital">b</span>) (without the change of vowel) ‘for the adversary (Haman) is not worth troubling the king about.’ But we are not justified in forcing the word properly translated ‘damage’ to mean ‘annoyance.[75]’ The LXX. have ‘for the adversary is not worthy of the court of the king.’[76]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[75] It may be noted that the word is a ‘loan-word’ from Aramaic, and occurs in this passage only of the Bible.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[76] <span class="greekheb">οὐ γὰρ ἅξιος ὁ διάβολος τῆς αὐλῆς</span> (apparently reading <span class="greekheb">הצר</span> over again as <span class="greekheb">חצר</span>) <span class="greekheb">τοῦ βασιλέως</span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/esther/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For we are sold, I and my people</span>. Haman has paid our price, has given ten thousand talents for us, and you, O king, have sold us to him. The reproach is covert, but clearly contained in the words; and so the king must have understood Esther. <span class="cmt_word">To be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish</span>. The use of three synonyms for one and the same thing is not mere verbiage, but very expressive. "We are sold, all of us, to be overwhelmed in one universal, promiscuous, unsparing destruction." <span class="cmt_word">Although the enemy could not countervail the king's damage</span>. "Although, even in that case, the enemy (Haman) could not (by the payment that he has made) compensate the king for the damage that he would suffer by losing so many subjects." So Gesenius, Rambach, Dathe, and others. But it is simpler, and Perhaps better, to understand the passage as Bertheau does: "for the enemy (Haman) is not worthy to vex the king," or "is not worth vexing the king about." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/esther/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>After this honour had been paid him, Mordochai returned to the king's gate; but Haman hasted to his house, "sad and with his head covered," to relate to his wife and friends all that had befallen him. A deeper mortification he could not have experienced than that of being obliged, by the king's command, publicly to show the highest honour to the very individual whose execution he was just about to propose to him. The covering of the head is a token of deep confusion and mourning; comp. <a href="/jeremiah/14-4.htm">Jeremiah 14:4</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/15-30.htm">2 Samuel 15:30</a>. Then his wise men, and Zeresh his wife, said to him: "If Mordochai, before whom thou hast begun to fall, be of the seed of the Jews, thou wilt not prevail against him, but wholly fall before him." &#1500;&#1493; &#1514;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500; &#1500;&#1488;, non praevalebis ei, comp. <a href="/genesis/32-26.htm">Genesis 32:26</a>. &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1500; &#1504;&#1508;&#1493;&#1500; with an emphatic infin. absol.: wholly fall. Instead of the &#1495;&#1499;&#1502;&#1497;&#1493; &#1488;&#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1493; are here named, or to speak more correctly the friends of Haman are here called his wise men (magi). Even in <a href="/esther/5-14.htm">Esther 5:14</a> Haman's friends figure as those with whom he takes counsel concerning Mordochai, i.e., as his counsellors or advisers; hence it is very probable that there were magi among their number, who now "come forward as a genus sapientum et doctorum (Cicero, divin. i. 23)" (Berth.), and predict his overthrow in his contest with Mordochai. The ground of this prediction is stated: "If Mordochai is of the seed of the Jews," i.e., of Jewish descent, then after this preliminary fall a total fall is inevitable. Previously (<a href="/esther/5-14.htm">Esther 5:14</a>) they had not hesitated to advise him to hang the insignificant Jew; but now that the insignificant Jew has become, as by a miracle, a man highly honoured by the king, the fact that the Jews are under the special protection of Providence is pressed upon them. Ex fato populorum, remarks Grotius, de singulorum fatis judicabant. Judaei gravissime oppressi a Cyri temporibus contra spem omnem resurgere caeperant. We cannot, however, regard as well founded the further remark: de Amalecitis audierant oraculum esse, eos Judaeorum manu perituros, which Grotius, with most older expositors, derives from the Amalekite origin of Haman. The revival of the Jewish people since the times of Cyrus was sufficient to induce, in the minds of heathen who were attentive to the signs of the times, the persuasion that this nation enjoyed divine protection. </body></html>
