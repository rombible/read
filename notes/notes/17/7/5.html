How should we pray for the salvation of our relatives, friends, and all around us! When we petition great men, we must be cautious not to give them offence; even just complaints must often be kept back. But when we approach the King of kings with reverence, we cannot ask or expect too much.

The words in the original text lie thus, "and the King Ahasuerus said, and he said to Esther the queen"; which doubling of the word does not signify, as Jarchi suggests, that before he spoke to her by a messenger, or middle person, but, now he knew she was of a royal family, he spoke to her himself; but it is expressive of the ruffle of his mind, and the wrath and fury he was in, that he said it again and again, with a stern countenance and great vehemence of speech: <p>who is he? and where is he? who is the man? and where does he live? <p>that durst presume in his heart to do so; that has boldness, impudence, and courage enough to perpetrate so vile an action: or "that has filled his heart" (i); the devil no doubt filled his heart to do it, see <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/5-3.htm">Acts 5:3</a>, but the king had either forgot the decree he had granted, and the countenance he had given him to execute it; or, if he remembered it, he was now enraged that he should be drawn in to such an action by him; and perhaps till now was ignorant of Esther's descent, and knew not that she would be involved in the decree. <p>(i)   "qui replevit cor suum", Drusius; "implevit", De Dieu. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/esther/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then the king Ahasuerus answered and said unto Esther the queen, Who is he, and where is he, that durst presume in his heart to do so?</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/esther/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who is he</span>?

A deeper mortification he could not have experienced than that of being obliged, by the king's command, publicly to show the highest honour to the very individual whose execution he was just about to propose to him. The covering of the head is a token of deep confusion and mourning; comp. <a href="/jeremiah/14-4.htm">Jeremiah 14:4</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/15-30.htm">2 Samuel 15:30</a>. Then his wise men, and Zeresh his wife, said to him: "If Mordochai, before whom thou hast begun to fall, be of the seed of the Jews, thou wilt not prevail against him, but wholly fall before him." &#1500;&#1493; &#1514;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500; &#1500;&#1488;, non praevalebis ei, comp. <a href="/genesis/32-26.htm">Genesis 32:26</a>. &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1500; &#1504;&#1508;&#1493;&#1500; with an emphatic infin. absol.: wholly fall. Instead of the &#1495;&#1499;&#1502;&#1497;&#1493; &#1488;&#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1493; are here named, or to speak more correctly the friends of Haman are here called his wise men (magi). Even in <a href="/esther/5-14.htm">Esther 5:14</a> Haman's friends figure as those with whom he takes counsel concerning Mordochai, i.e., as his counsellors or advisers; hence it is very probable that there were magi among their number, who now "come forward as a genus sapientum et doctorum (Cicero, divin. i. 23)" (Berth.), and predict his overthrow in his contest with Mordochai. The ground of this prediction is stated: "If Mordochai is of the seed of the Jews," i.e., of Jewish descent, then after this preliminary fall a total fall is inevitable. Previously (<a href="/esther/5-14.htm">Esther 5:14</a>) they had not hesitated to advise him to hang the insignificant Jew; but now that the insignificant Jew has become, as by a miracle, a man highly honoured by the king, the fact that the Jews are under the special protection of Providence is pressed upon them. Ex fato populorum, remarks Grotius, de singulorum fatis judicabant. Judaei gravissime oppressi a Cyri temporibus contra spem omnem resurgere caeperant. We cannot, however, regard as well founded the further remark: de Amalecitis audierant oraculum esse, eos Judaeorum manu perituros, which Grotius, with most older expositors, derives from the Amalekite origin of Haman. The revival of the Jewish people since the times of Cyrus was sufficient to induce, in the minds of heathen who were attentive to the signs of the times, the persuasion that this nation enjoyed divine protection. </body></html>
