The king commanded him: "Make haste, take the apparel and the horse, as thou hast said," i.e., in the manner proposed by thee, "and do even so to Mordochai the Jew, that sitteth at the king's gate; let nothing fail of all that thou hast spoken," i.e., carry out your proposal exactly. How the king knew that Mordochai was a Jew, and that he sat in the king's gate, is not indeed expressly stated, but may easily be supplied from the conversation of the king with his servants concerning Mordochai's discovery of the conspiracy, <a href="//biblehub.com/esther/6-1.htm">Esther 6:1-3</a>. On this occasion the servants of the king would certainly give him particulars concerning Mordochai, who by daily frequenting the king's gate, <a href="/esther/2-19.htm">Esther 2:19</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/esther/5-9.htm">Esther 5:9</a>, would certainly have attracted the attention of all the king's suite. Nor can doubt be case upon the historical truth of the fact related in this verse by the question: whether the king had forgotten that all Jews were doomed to destruction, and that he had delivered them up to Haman for that purpose (J. D. Mich.). Such forgetfulness in the case of such a monarch as Xerxes cannot surprise us. </body></html>
