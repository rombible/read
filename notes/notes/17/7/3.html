When we petition great men, we must be cautious not to give them offence; even just complaints must often be kept back.

Not rolling herself at the king's knees, as Severus (f) writes; but rather, as the former Targum, lifting up her eyes to heaven, and perhaps putting up a secret ejaculation for direction and success: <p>if I have found favour in thy sight, O king; as she certainly had heretofore, and even now: <p>and if it please the king, let my life be given me at my petition; not riches, nor honour, nor any place or post at court, or in any of the king's dominions for any friend of her's, was her petition; but for her own life, that that might not be taken away, which was included in the grant the king had made to Haman, though ignorantly, to slay all the Jews, she being one of them: <p>and my people at my request; that is, the lives of her people also, that was her request; her own life and her people's were all she had to ask. <p>(f) Hist.

Some rhetorical skill is shown in separating the two, so as to make them correspond to the two clauses of the king's address "What is thy petition?" and "What is thy request?" <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/esther/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>This honour, then, the haughty Haman was now compelled to pay to the hated Jew. The king commanded him: "Make haste, take the apparel and the horse, as thou hast said," i.e., in the manner proposed by thee, "and do even so to Mordochai the Jew, that sitteth at the king's gate; let nothing fail of all that thou hast spoken," i.e., carry out your proposal exactly. How the king knew that Mordochai was a Jew, and that he sat in the king's gate, is not indeed expressly stated, but may easily be supplied from the conversation of the king with his servants concerning Mordochai's discovery of the conspiracy, <a href="//biblehub.com/esther/6-1.htm">Esther 6:1-3</a>. On this occasion the servants of the king would certainly give him particulars concerning Mordochai, who by daily frequenting the king's gate, <a href="/esther/2-19.htm">Esther 2:19</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/esther/5-9.htm">Esther 5:9</a>, would certainly have attracted the attention of all the king's suite. Nor can doubt be case upon the historical truth of the fact related in this verse by the question: whether the king had forgotten that all Jews were doomed to destruction, and that he had delivered them up to Haman for that purpose (J. D. Mich.). Such forgetfulness in the case of such a monarch as Xerxes cannot surprise us. </body></html>
