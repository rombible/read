Thus not only does God vouchsafe to deliver his people, but He brings on the enemy the very destruction he had devised for his adversary: “He hath fallen himself into the pit that he digged for other.” Our Saviour has rescued us from our enemy who was too mighty for us, and has trodden down our foe, to be destroyed for ever in His own good time. So may we Christians see in the dangers threatening the Jews throughout this book a picture of our own, and in Haman’s discomfiture a type of the victory of the Lamb over sin and Satan.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/esther/7.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/esther/7-9.htm" title="And Harbonah, one of the chamberlains, said before the king, Behold also, the gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman had made for Mordecai, who spoken good for the king, stands in the house of Haman.

When angry, we should pause before we come to any resolution, and thus rule our own spirits, and show that we are governed by reason. Those that are most haughty and insolent when in power and prosperity, commonly, like Haman, are the most abject and poor-spirited when brought down. The day is coming when those that hate and persecute God's chosen ones, would gladly be beholden to them. The king returns yet more angry against Haman. Those about him were ready to put his wrath into execution. How little can proud men be sure of the interest they think they have! The enemies of God's church have often been thus taken in their own craftiness. The Lord is known by such judgments. Then was the king's wrath pacified, and not till then. And who pities Haman hanged on his own gallows? who does not rather rejoice in the Divine righteousness displayed in the destruction his own art brought upon him?

Esther then took courage to express her petition. After the usual introductory phrases (<a href="/esther/7-3.htm">Esther 7:3</a> like <a href="/esther/5-8.htm">Esther 5:8</a>), she replied: "Let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request." For, she adds as a justification and reason for such a petition, "we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. And if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen, I had been silent, for the enemy is not worth the king's damage." In this request &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497; is a short expression for: the life of my people, and the preposition &#1489;, the so-called &#1489;&#1468; pretii. The request is conceived of as the price which she offers or presents for her life and that of her people. The expression &#1504;&#1502;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, we are sold, is used by Esther with reference to the offer of Haman to pay a large sum into the royal treasury for the extermination of the Jews, <a href="/esther/3-9.htm">Esther 3:9</a>; <a href="/esther/4-7.htm">Esther 4:7</a>. &#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, contracted after Aramaean usage from &#1500;&#1493;&#1468; &#1488;&#1501;, and occurring also <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/6-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:6</a>, supposes a case, the realization of which is desired, but not to be expected, the matter being represented as already decided by the use of the perfect. The last clause, &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1492;&#1510;&#1468;&#1512; &#1488;&#1497;&#1503; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, is by most expositors understood as a reference, on the part of Esther, to the financial loss which the king would incur by the extermination of the Jews. Thus Rambach, e.g., following R. Sal. ben Melech, understands the meaning expressed to be: hostis nullo modo aequare, compensare, resarcire potest pecunia sua damnum, quod rex ex nostro excidio patitur. So also Cler. and others. The confirmatory clause would in this case refer not to &#1492;&#1495;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, but to a negative notion needing completion: but I dare not be silent; and such completion is itself open to objection. To this must be added, that &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1492; in Kal constructed with &#1489;&#1468; does not signify compensare, to equalize, to make equal, but to be equal; consequently the Piel should be found here to justify the explanation proposed. &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1492; in Kal constructed with &#1489;&#1468; signifies to be of equal worth with something, to equal another thing in value. Hence Gesenius translates: the enemy does not equal the damage of the king, i.e., is not in a condition to compensate the damage. But neither when thus viewed does the sentence give any reason for Esther's statement, that she would have been silent, if the Jews had been sold for salves. Hence we are constrained, with Bertheau, to take a different view of the words, and to give up the reference to financial loss. &#1504;&#1494;&#1511;, in the Targums, means not merely financial, but also bodily, personal damage; e.g., <a href="/psalms/91-7.htm">Psalm 91:7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/26-11.htm">Genesis 26:11</a>, to do harm, <a href="/1_chronicles/16-22.htm">1 Chronicles 16:22</a>. Hence the phrase may be understood thus: For the enemy is not equal to, is not worth, the damage of the king, i.e., not worthy that I should annoy the king with my petition. Thus Esther says, <a href="/esther/7-4.htm">Esther 7:4</a> : The enemy has determined upon the total destruction of my people. If he only intended to bring upon them grievous oppression, even that most grievous oppression of slavery, I would have been silent, for the enemy is not worthy that I should vex or annoy the king by my accusation.</body></html>
