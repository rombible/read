For the history and character of this sovereign reference must be especially made to the contemporaneous writers, Herodotus (vii., viii. 1-90), and Æschylus in his play of <span class= "ital">The Persians.</span> The spirited lines of Juvenal should also be read (<span class= "ital">Sat.</span> x. 173-187). We find that Xerxes succeeded his father, Darius Hystaspes, in the year 485 B.C. , five years after the momentous battle of Marathon. Undeterred by his father’s failure, he resolves upon a fresh attack on Greece, and sets out in 481 B.C. from Susa for the West. He winters at Sardis, leaving it in the spring of the following year. The summer sees the fight of the pass of Thermopylæ, which has covered the name of Leonidas and his three hundred, though vanquished and slain, with undying glory; in the autumn Themistocles, by his victory over the Persians at Salamis, changes the history of the world, and the beginning thus made is carried on by the victories at Platæa and Mycale in 479 B.C. From the rout at Salamis, Xerxes had fled to Sardis, which he did not leave till the spring of 478 B.C. All that we know of the further course of the reign of Xerxes is but one unbroken tale of debauchery and bloodshed, which came to an end in 464 B.C, when he was murdered by two of his officers, Mithridates and Artabanus, and Artaxerxes Longimanus, his son (see Ezra 7; Nehemiah 2), reigned in his stead.<p><span class= "bld">This is Ahasuerus.</span>—This is added to make clear which particular sovereign we are here dealing with.

There seem to have been a gradually increasing number of satrapies in the kingdom of Darius—20, 21, 23, 29 (Herod, iii. 89-94), and the nations in the empire of Xerxes are said to be sixty (<span class= "ital">ib.</span> vii. 61-95).

The satrapies of Darius Hystaspis reached 29 in number, and the nations under Xerxes were about 60.

Who he was is not easy to say; almost all the kings of Persia are so named by one or another writer. He cannot be the Ahasuerus in <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/9-1.htm">Daniel 9:1</a>, he was Astyages, the father of Cyaxares or Darius the Mede; but this must be one who had his royal palace in Shushan, which was never the royal city of the Medes, but of the Persians only; nor does he seem to be the Ahasuerus in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/4-6.htm">Ezra 4:6</a>, who is thought to be Cambyses, the son and successor of Cyrus; since, according to the canon of Ptolemy, he reigned but eight years, whereas this Ahasuerus at least reigned twelve, <a href="//biblehub.com/esther/3-7.htm">Esther 3:7</a>, though indeed some account for it by his reigning in his father's lifetime; besides, Cambyses was always an enemy to the Jews, as this was not; and yet this way go many of the Jewish writers (n) and so a very learned man, Nicolaus Abram (o); according to Bishop Usher (p), this was Darius Hystaspis, who certainly was a friend to the Jewish nation; but he is rather the Artaxerxes of Ezra and Nehemiah; and so says the Midrash (q). Dr. Prideaux (r) thinks Ahasuerus was Artaxerxes Longimanus, which is the sense of Josephus (s), and who is thought by many to be the Artaxerxes in the foresaid books. Capellus (t) is of opinion, that Darius Ochus is meant, to which Bishop Patrick inclines; but I rather think, with Vitringa (u) and others (w), that Xerxes is the Ahasuerus that was the husband of Esther here spoken of; so the Arabic writers (x); and as he was the son and successor of Darius Hystaspis, if he is meant by Artaxerxes in the preceding books, the history of which is carried to the thirty second year of his reign, <a href="/nehemiah/13-6.htm">Nehemiah 13:6</a> and who reigned but four years more; this book of Esther stands in right order of time to carry on the history of the Jewish affairs in the Persian monarchy; and Mr. Broughton (y) owns, that the name of Xerxes, in Greek, agrees with Achasuerus in Hebrew; and in <a href="/esther/10-1.htm">Esther 10:1</a> his name is Achashresh, which, with the Greeks, is Axeres or Xerxes (z): <p>this is Ahasuerus, which reigned from India even unto Ethiopia; properly so called; the Ethiopians had been subdued by Cambyses the son and successor of Cyrus (a), and the Indians by Darius Hystaspis the father of Xerxes (b); and both, with other great nations, were retained in subjection to him (c); and many of both, as well as of other nations, were with him in his expedition into Greece (d): <p>over an hundred and twenty and seven provinces; there were now seven provinces more under his jurisdiction than were in the times of Darius the Mede, <a href="/daniel/6-1.htm">Daniel 6:1</a>. <p>(n) Targum &amp; Jarchi in loc.

In the case of similar openings to other historical Books (Joshua, Judges, etc.) it implies the continuation of a former narrative. Here, on the other hand, as probably at the commencement of Ezekiel and Jonah, it only denotes a connexion in the writer’s own mind with preceding history in general or with the period of Ahasuerus in particular. It may even have become established as an opening formula, irrespective of its strict applicability.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Ahasuerus</span>] The Heb. <span class="ital">Aḥashvçrôsh</span> represents the Persian <span class="ital">Khshayarsha</span> (<span class="ital">mighty eye</span>, or, <span class="ital">mighty man</span>), whence was derived the Greek <span class="ital">Xerxes</span>, who is no doubt the monarch intended. The Ahasuerus of this Book has indeed been identified with (<span class="ital">a</span>) Cambyses (b.c. 529), father of Darius Hystaspes, on the strength of <a href="/daniel/9-1.htm" title="In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes, which was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans;">Daniel 9:1</a>, a passage, however, which in reality lends no aid to this hypothesis (see Driver in <span class="ital">Camb. Bible, ad loc.</span>), or (<span class="ital">b</span>) Artaxerxes Longimanus, the son and successor of Xerxes (b.c. 465–425), with whom the LXX., followed by Josephus, identifies him, or (<span class="ital">c</span>) Cyaxares, a Median ruler, or (<span class="ital">d</span>) ‘Darius the Mede’ of <a href="/daniel/5-31.htm" title="And Darius the Median took the kingdom, being about three score and two years old.">Daniel 5:31</a> (where see note in <span class="ital">Camb. Bible</span>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The last two identifications may be at once dismissed. Ahasuerus was evidently a king of <span class="ital">Persia</span>, as is shewn by the extent of his dominions as well as from other considerations, such as the whole atmosphere of the Book. Moreover (<span class="ital">b</span>) is precluded by the Hebrew, which uses the form <span class="ital">Artaḥshashta</span> for Artaxerxes (<a href="/ezra/4-7.htm" title="And in the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of their companions, to Artaxerxes king of Persia; and the writing of the letter was written in the Syrian tongue, and interpreted in the Syrian tongue.">Ezra 4:7</a>). Accordingly there can be little or no doubt that Xerxes (b.c. 485–465), conspicuous in history for the defeat of his gigantic armaments at Salamis (b.c. 480) and Plataea (479), is the king of whom we here read. Further, (i) the capricious and sensual character of Ahasuerus corresponds with the notices of Xerxes in Herodotus (ix. 108 ff.), (ii) the extent of his empire agrees with the account here, (iii) the gathering at Susa in the third year of his reign (<span class="ital"><a href="/esther/1-3.htm" title="In the third year of his reign, he made a feast to all his princes and his servants; the power of Persia and Media, the nobles and princes of the provinces, being before him:">Esther 1:3</a></span>) harmonises with the statement of Herodotus (vii. 8) that after Xerxes’ subjugation of Egypt there was a great assembly of satraps at Susa to make arrangements for the attack on Greece about two years later, while the interval of four years between Vashti’s disgrace and Esther’s promotion (<a href="/esther/2-16.htm" title="So Esther was taken to king Ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.">Esther 2:16</a>) leaves time for the king’s return from that ill-fated expedition to comfort himself for its ignominious ending with sensual gratifications.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">from India even unto Ethiopia</span>] The word in the original for India (<span class="ital">Hôddu</span>) appears to represent the Persian <span class="ital">Hidush</span>. Both have lost the <span class="ital">n</span> which has been retained by the Greek (LXX. <span class="greekheb">τῆς Ἰνδικῆς</span>), and so (through the Latin) by ourselves. The name was originally confined to the land watered by the seven streams of the Indus, and was later extended eastward and southward. Ethiopia, here and elsewhere, is the Heb. Cush.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">an hundred and seven and twenty provinces</span>] The satrapies into which the Persian Empire was divided were, according to Herodotus (iii. 89), at first but twenty. The Heb. word here, however, (<span class="ital">mědînâh</span>) denotes a subdivision of the satrapy, so that the large number given in the text may be quite accurate. The later Aramaic paraphrase (<span class="ital">Targum Shçnî</span>, or second Targum; see Introd. p. xxxiii) fancifully connects the number of the provinces over which Ahasuerus was permitted by God to rule with the fact that he was destined to take for his queen a descendant of Sarah who lived a hundred and twenty-seven years (see <a href="/genesis/23-1.htm" title="And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old: these were the years of the life of Sarah.">Genesis 23:1</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/esther/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the days of Ahasuerus</span>. Ahasuerus, in the original <span class="accented">Akhashverosh</span>, corresponds to <span class="accented">Khshayarsha</span> (the Persian name from which the Greeks formed their Xerxes) almost as closely as possible. The prosthelic a was a necessity of Hebrew articulation. The only unnecessary change was the substitution of <span class="accented">v</span> for <span class="accented">y</span> (<span class="accented">vau</span> for <span class="accented">yod</span>) in the penultimate syllable. But this interchange is very common in Hebrew. <span class="cmt_word">This is Ahasuerus which reigned, etc</span>. The writer is evidently acquainted with more than a single Ahasuerus. Ezra had mentioned one (<a href="/ezra/4-6.htm">Ezra 4:6</a>), and Daniel another (<a href="/daniel/9-1.htm">Daniel 9:1</a>). If he knew their works, he would necessarily know of these two. Or he may have known of them independently. The Ahasuerus of his narrative being different from either, he proceeds to distinguish him <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> from the Ahasuerus of Daniel, as a "king," and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> from the Ahasuerus of Ezra by the extent of his dominion. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Cambyses (see comment on Ezra 4:6) had not ruled over India. India is expressed by <span class="accented">Hoddu</span>, which seems formed from the Persian <span class="accented">Hidush</span> ('Nakhsh-i-Rus-tam Inser.,' par. 3, 1. 25), by the omission of the nominatival ending, and a slight modification of the vocalisation. The Sanscrit and the Zend, like the Greek, retained the <span class="accented">n</span>, which is really an essential part of the native word. <span class="cmt_word">Ethiopia</span> is expressed, as usual, by <span class="accented">Cush</span>.

The Hebrew <span class="accented">medinah</span>, "province," does not correspond to the Persian satrapy, but is applied to every tract which had its own governor.

Nehemiah did not insist on the immediate dissolution of these marriages, but caused the men to swear that they would desist from such connections, setting before them, in <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-26.htm">Nehemiah 13:26</a>, how grievous a sin they were committing. "Did not Solomon, king of Israel, sin on account of these?" (&#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; &#1506;&#1500;, on account of strange wives). And among many nations there was no king like him (comp. <a href="/1_kings/3-12.htm">1 Kings 3:12</a>., <a href="/2_chronicles/1-12.htm">2 Chronicles 1:12</a>); and he was beloved of his God (alluding to <a href="/2_samuel/12-24.htm">2 Samuel 12:24</a>), and God made him king over all Israel (<a href="/1_kings/4-1.htm">1 Kings 4:1</a>); and even him did foreign women cause to sin (comp. <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/11-1.htm">1 Kings 11:1-3</a>). "And of you is it heard to do (that ye do) all this great evil, to transgress against our God, and to marry strange wives?" Bertheau thus rightly understands the sentence: "If the powerful King Solomon was powerless to resist the influence of foreign wives, and if he, the beloved God, found in his relation to God no defence against the sin to which they seduced him, is it not unheard of for you to commit so great an evil?" He also rightly explains &#1492;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; according to <a href="/deuteronomy/9-23.htm">Deuteronomy 9:23</a>; while Gesenius in his Thes. still takes it, like Rambach, as the first person imperf.: nobisne morem geramus faciendo; or: Should we obey you to do so great an evil? (de Wette); which meaning - apart from the consideration that no obedience, but only toleration of the illegal act, is here in question - greatly weakens, if it does not quite destroy, the contrast between Solomon and &#1500;&#1499;&#1501;. </body></html>
