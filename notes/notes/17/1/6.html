Or curtains of fine linen, as the Targum, which were of these several colours; the first letter of the word for "white" is larger than usual, to denote the exceeding whiteness of them. The next word is "carpas", which Ben Melech observes is a dyed colour, said to be green. Pausanias (q) makes mention of Carpasian linen, and which may be here meant; the last word used signifies blue, sky coloured, or hyacinth: <p>fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings, and pillars of marble; these pillars are said, in the Targum, to be of divers colours, red, green, and shining yellow and white, on which the silver rings were fixed, and into them were put linen strings of purple colour, which fastened the hangings to them, and so made an enclosure, within which the guests sat at the feast: <p>the beds were of gold and silver; the couches on which they sat, or rather reclined at eating, as was the manner of the eastern nations; these, according to the Targum, were of lambs' wool, the finest, and the softest, and the posts of them were of gold, and their feet of silver. Such luxury obtained among the Romans in later times (r): <p>these were placed in a pavement of red, and blue, and white, and black, marble; which, according to some, are the porphyrite, Parian, alabaster, and marble of various colours; the marble of the Persians is of four colours, white, black, red and black, and white and black (s); but others take them to be precious stones, as Jarchi and Aben Ezra; the first is by the Targum interpreted crystal, by others the emerald, one of which Theophrastus (t) speaks of as four cubits long, and three broad, which might be laid in a pavement; the third is, by Bochart (u), supposed to be the pearl; and in the Talmud (w) it is said to be of such a nature, that if placed in the middle of a dining room, will give light in it as at noonday, which seems to be what is called lychnites; to which Lucian (x) ascribes a like property: nor need all this seem strange, since great was the luxury of the eastern nations. Philostratus (y) speaks of a temple in India paved with pearls, and which he says all the Barbarians use in their temples; particularly it is said (z), that the roofs of the palaces of Shushan and Ecbatana, the palaces of the kings of Persia, shone with gold and silver, ivory, and amber; no wonder then that their pavements were of very valuable and precious stones: and from hence it appears, that the "lithostrata", the word here used by the Septuagint, or tesserated pavements, were in use four hundred years before the times of Sylla, where the beginning of them is placed by Pliny (a); there was a "lithostraton" in the second temple at Jerusalem, by us rendered the pavement, <a href="//biblehub.com/john/19-13.htm">John 19:13</a>, perhaps the same with the room Gazith, so called from its being laid with hewn stone. Aristeas (b), who lived in the times of Ptolemy Philadelphus, testifies that the whole floor of the temple was a "lithostraton", or was paved with stone: it is most likely therefore that these had their original in the eastern country, and not in Greece, as Pliny (c) supposed. <p>(q) Attica, sive, l. 1. p. 48.

The word translated ‘green’ in the text is best rendered <span class="ital">cotton</span>, and is of Persian origin.[58] The cords, which by means of silver rings attached the hangings to the pillars, furnished a contrast of colour, viz. fine, white linen, mixed with a reddish purple.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[58] <span class="ital">Karpas</span> borrowed by the Greek in the form <span class="greekheb">κάρπασος</span> (Lat. <span class="ital">carbasus</span>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">pillars of marble</span>] The remains of the pillars found at Susa are of a dark blue limestone, which the Heb. word may very well denote.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the couches were of gold and silver</span>] i.e. with coverlets of gold and silver work, or possibly with a framework of these materials (so the Targum explains), like those which Herod.

For the ‘white and yellow’ of R.V. A.V. had ‘blue and white.’ A mosaic pavement of various costly materials is apparently meant, but the precise meaning of the terms used is uncertain. Perhaps we may take it that each is the name of a material, not a colour, and render <span class="ital">porphyry</span> (or <span class="ital">alabaster</span>), <span class="ital">marble, pearl-stone</span>, and <span class="ital">dark paving-stone</span>. We should observe, however, that the second of these is the same word as that used in the description of the pillars (see note), and that the last may mean marble with dark spots or streaks.

There is nothing in the original corresponding to "green." The "hangings," or rather awning, was of white cotton (<span class="accented">karphas</span>) and violet. Mr. Loftus supposes that it was carried across from the central pillared hall to the detached porticoes, thus shading the guests from the intense heat of the sun ('Chaldaea and Susiana,' p. 375). <span class="cmt_word">Fastened with cords of fine linen and purple</span>. Very strong cords would be needed to support the awning if it was carried across as above suggested, over a space of nearly sixty feet. <span class="cmt_word">To rings of silver</span>. The exact use of the rings is doubtful. Perhaps they were inserted into the stone work in order that the cords might be made fast to them. <span class="cmt_word">Pillars of marble</span>. The pillars at Susa are not of marble, but of a dark-blue limestone. Perhaps the Hebrew <span class="accented">shesh</span> designated this stone rather than marble. <span class="cmt_word">The beds were of gold and silver</span>. The couches on which the guests reclined are intended (comp. <a href="/esther/7-8.htm">Esther 7:8</a>). These were either covered with gold and silver cloth, or had their actual framework of the precious metals, like those which Xerxes took with him into Greece (see Herod., 9:82). <span class="cmt_word">Upon a pavement of red, and blue, and white, and black marble.</span> The four words which follow "pavement" are not adjectives denoting colours, but the names of four different materials. One is <span class="accented">shesh</span>, the material of the pillars, which accords with the fact that such pavement slabs as have been found at Susa are, like the columns, of a blue limestone. The other materials are unknown to us, and we cannot say what the exact colours were; but no doubt the general result was a mosaic pavement of four different hues. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/nehemiah/13.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Nehemiah concludes his work with a short summary of what he had effected for the community.

On the arrangements connected with these two subjects, viz., the purification from heathen practices, and the restoration of the regular performance of divine worship, was Nehemiah's whole energy concentrated, after the fortification of Jerusalem by a wall of circumvallation had been completed. He thus earned a lasting claim to the gratitude of the congregation of his fellow-countryman that returned from Babylon, and could conclude his narrative with the prayer that God would remember him for good. On this frequently-repeated supplication (comp. <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-14.htm">Nehemiah 13:14</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-22.htm">Nehemiah 13:22</a>, and <a href="/nehemiah/5-19.htm">Nehemiah 5:19</a>) Rambach justly remarks: magnam Nehemiae pietatem spirat.
