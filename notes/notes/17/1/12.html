He that had rule over 127 provinces, had no rule over his own spirit.

The refusal of Vashti to obey an order which required her to make an indecent exposure of herself before a company of drunken revellers, was becoming both the modesty of her sex and her rank as queen; for, according to Persian customs, the queen, even more than the wives of other men, was secluded from the public gaze. Had not the king's blood been heated with wine, or his reason overpowered by force of offended pride, he would have perceived that his own honor, as well as hers, was consulted by her dignified conduct.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/esther/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Vashti refused to come; </span> being favoured in this refusal by the laws and customs of Persia, which was to keep men’s wives, and especially queens, as much as might be from the view of other men. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/esther/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But the queen refused to came at the king's commandment by his chamberlains,....

This verse has been understood by most expositors as stating that the king magnificently and splendidly entertained all the grandees mentioned in <a href="/esther/1-3.htm">Esther 1:3</a> for a full half-year, and gave them a banquet which lasted 180 days. Clericus supposes proceedings to have been so arranged, that the proceres omnium provinciarum were not entertained at one and the same time, but alii post alios, because all could not be absent together per sex menses a suis provinciis. Bertheau, however, thinks that the historian did not purpose to give an exact and graphic description of the proceeding, but only to excite astonishment, and that they who are astonished will not inquire as to the manner in which all took place. The text, however, does not say, that the feast lasted 180 days, and hence offers no occasion for such a view, which is founded on a mistaken comprehension of <a href="//biblehub.com/esther/1-4.htm">Esther 1:4</a>, which combines &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1512;&#1488;&#1514;&#1493; with &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; of <a href="//biblehub.com/esther/1-3.htm">Esther 1:3</a>, while the whole of <a href="/esther/1-4.htm">Esther 1:4</a> is but a further amplification of the circumstantial clause: when the forces, etc., were before him; the description of the banquet not following till <a href="//biblehub.com/esther/1-5.htm">Esther 1:5</a>, where, however, it is joined to the concluding words of <a href="/esther/1-4.htm">Esther 1:4</a> : "when these (180) days were full, the king made a feast to all the people that were found in the citadel of Susa, from great to small, seven days, in the court of the garden of the king's house." This verse is thus explained by Bertheau: after the soldiers, nobles, and princes of the district had been entertained for six months, all the male inhabitants of Susa were also entertained in a precinct of the palace garden, the women being feasted by Vashti the queen in the palace (<a href="/esther/1-9.htm">Esther 1:9</a>), It is, however, obvious, even from <a href="//biblehub.com/esther/1-11.htm">Esther 1:11</a>, which says that on the seventh day of this banquet the king commanded the queen to appear "to show the people and the princes her beauty," that such a view of the occurrence is inadmissible. For this command presupposes, that the people and princes were assembled at the king's banquet; while, according to the view of Bertheau and older expositors, who insist on two banquets, one lasting 180 days, the other seven, the latter was given to the male inhabitants of Susa only. The princes and people of the whole kingdom did not, however, dwell in Susa. These princes and people, to whom the queen was to show her beauty, are undoubtedly the princes and servants of the king, the forces of Persia and Media, and the nobles and princes of the provinces enumerated in <a href="/esther/1-3.htm">Esther 1:3</a>. With this agrees also the description of the guests invited to the seven days feast. &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1503; &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1502;&#1510;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1506;&#1501; does not signify "all the inhabitants of Susa," but all then present, i.e., then assembled in the citadel of Susa. &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1502;&#1510;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; used of persons means, those who for some purpose are found or present in any place, in distinction from its usual inhabitants; comp. <a href="/1_chronicles/29-17.htm">1 Chronicles 29:17</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/34-32.htm">2 Chronicles 34:32</a>; <a href="/ezra/8-25.htm">Ezra 8:25</a>; and &#1492;&#1506;&#1501; does not here signify people in the sense of population, but people who are met in a certain place, and is used both here and <a href="/nehemiah/12-38.htm">Nehemiah 12:38</a> of an assembly of nobles and princes. &#1511;&#1496;&#1503; &#1493;&#1506;&#1491; &#1500;&#1502;&#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1493;&#1500;, moreover, does not mean old and young, but high and low, the greater and lesser servants (&#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;) of the king, and informs us that of those assembled at Susa, both princes and servants participated without exception in the banquet.<p>This view of <a href="//biblehub.com/esther/1-3.htm">Esther 1:3-5</a> is confirmed by the consideration, that if the seven days banquet were a different one from that mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/esther/1-3.htm">Esther 1:3</a>, there could be no reason for naming the latter, which would then be not only entirely unconnected with the narrative, but for which no object at all would be stated; for &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1512;&#1488;&#1514;&#1493; cannot be translated, as in the Vulgate, by ut ostenderet, because, as Bertheau justly remarks, &#1489; cannot indicate a purpose. From all these reasons it is obvious, that the feast of which further particulars are given in <a href="//biblehub.com/esther/1-5.htm">Esther 1:5-8</a> is the same &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; which the king, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/esther/1-3.htm">Esther 1:3</a>, gave to his &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; and &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;, and that the text, rightly understood, says nothing of two consecutive banquets. The sense of <a href="//biblehub.com/esther/1-3.htm">Esther 1:3-5</a> is accordingly as follows: King Ahasuerus gave to his nobles and princes, when he had assembled them before him, and showed them the glorious riches of his kingdom and the magnificence of his greatness for 180 days, after these 180 days, to all assembled before him in the fortress of Susa, a banquet which lasted seven days. The connection of the more particular description of this banquet, by means of the words: when these (the previously named 180) days were over, following upon the accessory clause, <a href="//biblehub.com/esther/1-4.htm">Esther 1:4</a>, is anacoluthistic, and the anacoluthon has given rise to the misconception, by which <a href="/esther/1-5.htm">Esther 1:5</a> is understood to speak of a second banquet differing from the &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; of <a href="/esther/1-3.htm">Esther 1:3</a>. The purpose for which the king assembled the grandees of his kingdom around him in Susa fore a whole half-year is not stated, because this has no connection with the special design of the present book. If, however, we compare the statement of Herod. vii. 8, that Xerxes, after the re-subjection of Egypt, summoned the chief men of his kingdom to Susa to take counsel with them concerning the campaign against Greece, it is obvious, that the assembly for 180 days in Susa, of the princes and nobles mentioned in the book of Esther, took place for the purpose of such consultation. When, too, we compare the statement of Herod. vii. 20, that Xerxes was four years preparing for this war, we receive also a corroboration of the particular mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/esther/1-3.htm">Esther 1:3</a>, that he assembled his princes and nobles in the third year of his reign. In this view "the riches of his kingdom," etc., mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/esther/1-4.htm">Esther 1:4</a>, must not be understood of the splendour and magnificence displayed in the entertainment of his guests, but referred to the greatness and resources of the realm, which Xerxes descanted on to his assembled magnates for the purpose of showing them the possibility of carrying into execution his contemplated campaign against Greece. The banquet given them after the 180 days of consultation, was held in the court of the garden of the royal palace. &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1503; is a later form of &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;, which occurs only here and <a href="//biblehub.com/esther/7-7.htm">Esther 7:7-8</a>. &#1495;&#1510;&#1512;, court, is the space in the park of the royal castle which was prepared for the banquet. The fittings and furniture of this place are described in <a href="/esther/1-6.htm">Esther 1:6</a>. "White stuff, variegated and purple hangings, fastened with cords of byssus and purple to silver rings and marble pillars; couches of gold and silver upon a pavement of malachite and marble, mother-of-pearl and tortoise-shell." The description consists of mere allusions to, or exclamations at, the splendour of the preparations. In the first half of the verse the hangings of the room, in the second, the couches for the guests, are noticed. &#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; from &#1495;&#1493;&#1512; means a white tissue of either linen or cotton. Bertheau supposes that the somewhat larger form of ch is intended to denote, even by the size of letter employed, the commencement of the description. &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1508;&#1468;&#1505;, occurring in Sanscrit, Persian, Armenian, and Arabic, in Greek &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, means originally cotton, in Greek, according to later authorities, a kind of fine flax, here undoubtedly a cotton texture of various colours. &#1514;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;&#1514;, deep blue, purple. The hangings of the space set apart were of these materials. Blue and white were, according to Curtius <a href="//biblehub.com/esther/6-6.htm">Esther 6:6</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/esther/6-4.htm">Esther 6:4</a>, the royal colours of the Persians; comp. M. Duncker, Gesch. des Alterthums, ii. pp. 891 and 951 of the third edition, in which is described also the royal table, p. 952. The hangings were fastened (&#1488;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494;) with cords of white byssus and purple to rings and pillars of white marble. &#1502;&#1496;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, couches (divans) of gold and silver, i.e., covered with cloth woven of gold and silver thread, were prepared for the guests at the feast. These couches were placed upon a tesselated, mosaic-like floor; the tesselation being composed of stones of various colours. &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1496;, in Arabic a mock stone, in lxx &#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;, a spurious emerald, i.e., a green-coloured stone resembling the emerald, probably malachite or serpentine. &#1513;&#1473;&#1513;&#1473; is white marble; &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;, Arabic darrun, darratun, pearl, lxx &#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, a pearl-like stone, perhaps mother-of-pearl. &#1505;&#1495;&#1512;&#1514;, a kind of dark-coloured stone (from &#1505;&#1495;&#1512;  equals  &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1512;, to be dark), black, black marble with shield-like spots (all three words occur only here).</body></html>
