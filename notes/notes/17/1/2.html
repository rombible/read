The city of Susa was cut in two by a wide river, anciently called the Choaspes, and now known under the name of <span class="ital">Ab-Kharkha</span>. The populous quarters on the right bank are now marked by hardly perceptible undulations of the plain; on the left, the royal city, the citadel, and the palace. “Three huge mounds, forming a rhomboidal mass, 4500 feet long from N. to S., and 3000 feet broad from E. to W., are a standing witness to the size and magnificence of the buildings which formed the ancient citadel or acropolis,” Driver in <span class="ital">Camb. Bible</span> on <a href="/daniel/8-27.htm" title="And I Daniel fainted, and was sick certain days; afterward I rose up, and did the king's business; and I was astonished at the vision, but none understood it.">Daniel 8:27</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>M. Dieulafoy, a French architect and engineer, in 1884–6 carried out important excavations at Susa, and brought to light many interesting features, recovering the plan of the citadel, and extensive remains of the buildings of which it consisted. “Artaxerxes, in an inscription found on one of the columns, says: ‘My ancestor Darius built this <span class="ital">Apadâna</span> in ancient times. In the reign of Artaxerxes, my grandfather, it was consumed by fire. By the grace of Ahuramazda, Anaïtis, and Mithras, I have restored this <span class="ital">Apadâna</span>.’ An <span class="ital">Apadâna</span> was a large hall or throne-room. The <span class="ital">Apadâna</span> of Susa stood on the N. of the Acropolis: it formed a square of about 250 feet each way. The roof (which consisted of rafters and beams of cedar, brought from Lebanon) was supported by 36 columns in rows of six; the sides and back were composed of walls of brick, each pierced by four doors; the front of the hall was open. The columns were slender shafts of limestone, delicately fluted, and topped by magnificently carved capitals. In front of the hall, on each side, was a pylon or colonnade, with a frieze at the top 12 feet high, formed of beautifully enamelled bricks, the one decorated by a procession of lions, the other by a procession of ‘Immortals,’ the armed life-guards of the Persian kings. A garden surrounded the <span class="ital">Apadâna</span>, and in front of it on the south, was a large square for military manœuvres, etc. Adjoining it, on the east, was a large block of buildings forming the royal harem (the ‘house of the women’ of <a href="/esther/2-3.htm" title="And let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the fair young virgins to Shushan the palace, to the house of the women, to the custody of Hege the king's chamberlain, keeper of the women; and let their things for purification be given them:">Esther 2:3</a>, etc.): south of this was the royal palace, with a court in the centre (<a href="/esther/4-11.htm" title="All the king's servants, and the people of the king's provinces, do know, that whoever, whether man or women, shall come to the king into the inner court, who is not called, there is one law of his to put him to death, except such to whom the king shall hold out the golden scepter, that he may live: but I have not been called to come in to the king these thirty days.">Esther 4:11</a>; <a href="/esther/5-1.htm" title="Now it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on her royal apparel, and stood in the inner court of the king's house, over against the king's house: and the king sat on his royal throne in the royal house, over against the gate of the house.">Esther 5:1</a>).

Benjamin of Tudela, a Spanish-Hebrew traveller in the East in the 12th century (ed. Asher, London and Berlin, 1840, i. 117), mentions visiting the ruins of Xerxes’ palace, adding that even at that time 7000 Jews lived at Susa.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/esther/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The throne of his kingdom, which was in Shushan</span>. Though the Persian court resided a part of the year at Ecbatana, and occasionally visited Persepolis and Babylon (Xen., 'Cyrop.,' 8:6, &sect; 2; 'Anab.,' 3:5, &sect; 15), yet Susa was decidedly the ordinary seat of government, and ranked as the capital of the empire (see Herod., 3:49; AEschyl., 'Pers.,' 11. 122, 123; Ctes., 'Exe.

"Shushan <span class="cmt_word">the palace"</span> is distinguished from Shushan the city (<a href="/esther/9-12.htm">Esther 9:12-15</a>), the one occupying a lofty but artificial eminence towards the west, while the other lay at the base of this mound, stretching out a considerable distance towards the east. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/nehemiah/13.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>With these people also Nehemiah contended (&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1489; like <a href="/nehemiah/13-11.htm">Nehemiah 13:11</a> and <a href="/nehemiah/13-17.htm">Nehemiah 13:17</a>), cursed them, smote certain of their men, and plucked off their hair (&#1502;&#1512;&#1496;, see rem. on <a href="/ezra/9-3.htm">Ezra 9:3</a>), and made them swear by God: Ye shall not give your daughters, etc.; comp. <a href="/nehemiah/10-31.htm">Nehemiah 10:31</a>. On the recurrence of such marriages after the separations effected by Ezra of those existing at his arrival at Jerusalem. Nehemiah did not insist on the immediate dissolution of these marriages, but caused the men to swear that they would desist from such connections, setting before them, in <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-26.htm">Nehemiah 13:26</a>, how grievous a sin they were committing. "Did not Solomon, king of Israel, sin on account of these?" (&#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; &#1506;&#1500;, on account of strange wives). And among many nations there was no king like him (comp. <a href="/1_kings/3-12.htm">1 Kings 3:12</a>., <a href="/2_chronicles/1-12.htm">2 Chronicles 1:12</a>); and he was beloved of his God (alluding to <a href="/2_samuel/12-24.htm">2 Samuel 12:24</a>), and God made him king over all Israel (<a href="/1_kings/4-1.htm">1 Kings 4:1</a>); and even him did foreign women cause to sin (comp. <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/11-1.htm">1 Kings 11:1-3</a>). "And of you is it heard to do (that ye do) all this great evil, to transgress against our God, and to marry strange wives?" Bertheau thus rightly understands the sentence: "If the powerful King Solomon was powerless to resist the influence of foreign wives, and if he, the beloved God, found in his relation to God no defence against the sin to which they seduced him, is it not unheard of for you to commit so great an evil?" He also rightly explains &#1492;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; according to <a href="/deuteronomy/9-23.htm">Deuteronomy 9:23</a>; while Gesenius in his Thes. still takes it, like Rambach, as the first person imperf.: nobisne morem geramus faciendo; or: Should we obey you to do so great an evil? (de Wette); which meaning - apart from the consideration that no obedience, but only toleration of the illegal act, is here in question - greatly weakens, if it does not quite destroy, the contrast between Solomon and &#1500;&#1499;&#1501;. </body></html>
