Seasons of peculiar festivity often end in vexation. Superiors should be careful not to command what may reasonably be disobeyed. But when wine is in, men's reason departs from them. He that had rule over 127 provinces, had no rule over his own spirit. But whether the passion or the policy of the king was served by this decree, God's providence made way for Esther to the crown, and defeated Haman's wicked project, even before it had entered into his heart, and he arrived at his power.

Then the king said to the wise men&#8212;These were probably the magi, without whose advice as to the proper time of doing a thing the Persian kings never did take any step whatever; and the persons named in Es 1:14 were the "seven counsellors" (compare Ezr 7:14) who formed the state ministry. The combined wisdom of all, it seems, was enlisted to consult with the king what course should be taken after so unprecedented an occurrence as Vashti's disobedience of the royal summons. It is scarcely possible for us to imagine the astonishment produced by such a refusal in a country and a court where the will of the sovereign was absolute. The assembled grandees were petrified with horror at the daring affront. Alarm for the consequences that might ensue to each of them in his own household next seized on their minds; and the sounds of bacchanalian revelry were hushed into deep and anxious consultation what punishment to inflict on the refractory queen. But a purpose was to be served by the flattery of the king and the enslavement of all women. The counsellors were too intoxicated or obsequious to oppose the courtly advice of Memucan was unanimously resolved, with a wise regard to the public interests of the nation, that the punishment of Vashti could be nothing short of degradation from her royal dignity. The doom was accordingly pronounced and made known in all parts of the empire.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/esther/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Memucan, </span> though last named, spake first, either because the king first asked him; or because he was the chief of them all, either in dignity or in reputation; or because it then was, as now it is in many places, the custom for the youngest counsellors or judges to deliver their opinion first. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">To all the people; </span> by giving them an example and encouragement to contemn and disobey their husbands.

Who was the last, and perhaps the least and the youngest of the counsellors; it being appointed by the king, according to the latter Targum that when his counsellors sat, the least should give their counsel first; just as puisne judges, and the youngest peers with us, give their opinion in a case first: <p>Vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only, but also to all the princes, and to all the people that are in all the provinces of the King Ahasuerus; he means, by setting a bad example to their wives, as after explained; it is an exaggeration of her crime, and made with a design to incense the king the more against her. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/esther/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And Memucan answered before the king and the princes, Vashti the queen hath not done <span class="cverse3">{k}</span> wrong to the king only, but also to all the princes, and to all the people that <i>are</i> in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus.</span><p>(k) By her disobedience she has given an example to all women to do the same to their husbands.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/esther/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">16</span>. <span class="ital">And Memucan answered</span>] From the terms of his answer it is evident that there was no existing law in Persia which would meet the case. Therefore, if it was to be dealt with, one must be enacted. In favour of passing such a law Memucan adduces two considerations; (<span class="ital">a</span>) that Vashti’s perversity constituted an offence against the whole of the king’s dominions, and (<span class="ital">b</span>) that it was inexpedient that such an offence should go unpunished, inasmuch as the natural consequence would be that this domestic insubordination would be widely imitated. Memucan thus shews the worst side of an Oriental courtier by the servility with which he overlooks the fact that it was the outrageous conduct of the king which brought about the difficulty, as well as by the somewhat Macchiavellian attempt to cloak the jealousy which he and his companions felt at the queen’s influence under the pretext of regard for social welfare throughout the Empire.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">peoples</span>] See note on <span class="ital"><a href="/esther/1-11.htm" title="To bring Vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal, to show the people and the princes her beauty: for she was fair to look on.">Esther 1:11</a></span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/esther/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Memucan answered</span>. We gather from Memucan's reply that the Persian law had provided no penalty for the case in hand - had, in fact, not contemplated it. He first argues the matter on general grounds of morality (ver. 16) and expediency (vers. 17, 18), and then proposes the enactment of a new law - a <span class="accented">privilegium -</span> assigning Vashti a special punishment for her contempt of the king's order. The "<span class="accented">decree"</span> (ver. 20) would not have been necessary had there already existed a law on the point. <span class="cmt_word">Vashti, the queen, hath not done wrong to the king only</span>. With the servility to be expected in an Oriental and a courtier, Memucan throws himself wholly on the king's side - insinuates no word of blame against his royal master, on whom in justice the whole blame rested; but sets himself to make the worst he can of Vashti's conduct, which (he says) was a wrong not to Ahasuerus only, but to the whole male population of the empire, the princes included, who must expect their wives to throw off all subjection, in imitation of the queen's example, if her conduct were allowed to go unpunished. As such a condition of things would be intolerable, the king is urged to disgrace her publicly. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/esther/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Vashti the queen also gave a banquet to the women in the royal house (palace) which belonged to King Ahashverosh, probably in the royal apartments of the palace, which were placed at her disposal for this great feast to be given to the women. The name Vashti may be compared with the Old-Persian vahista, i.e., optimus. In Persian s&#780;ty, means a beautiful woman. This statement serves as an introduction to the scene which follows. <a href="/esther/1-10.htm">Esther 1:10</a> and <a href="/esther/1-11.htm">Esther 1:11</a>. On the seventh, i.e., the last day of the banquet, when the king's heart was merry with wine, he commanded his seven chamberlains to bring Vashti the queen before him, with the royal crown, to show here beauty to the people and princes. &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1500;&#1489; &#1499;&#1468;&#1496;&#1493;&#1489;, when the heart of the king was merry through wine, i.e., when the wine had made him merry, comp. <a href="/2_samuel/13-28.htm">2 Samuel 13:28</a>; <a href="/judges/16-25.htm">Judges 16:25</a>. It was the office of the seven eunuchs who served before the king (&#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1514; like <a href="/1_samuel/2-18.htm">1 Samuel 2:18</a>) to be the means of communication between him and the women, and to deliver to them messages on the part of the monarch. Their number, seven, was connected with that of the Amshaspands; see rem. on <a href="/esther/1-14.htm">Esther 1:14</a>. The attempts made to explain their several names are without adequate foundation; nor would much be gained thereby, the names being of no significance with respect to the matter in question. In the lxx the names vary to some extent. The queen was to appear with the crown on her head (&#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1512;, &#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; or &#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, a high turban terminating in a point), and, as is self-evident, otherwise royally apparelled. The queen was accustomed on ordinary occasions to take her meals at the king's table; comp. Herod. ix. 110. There is, however, an absence of historical proof, that she was present at great banquets. The notice quoted from Lucian in Brissonius, de regio Pers. princ. i. c. 103, is not sufficient for the purpose. </body></html>
