Seasons of peculiar festivity often end in vexation. Superiors should be careful not to command what may reasonably be disobeyed. But when wine is in, men's reason departs from them. He that had rule over 127 provinces, had no rule over his own spirit. But whether the passion or the policy of the king was served by this decree, God's providence made way for Esther to the crown, and defeated Haman's wicked project, even before it had entered into his heart, and he arrived at his power. Let us rejoice that the Lord reigns, and will overrule the madness or folly of mankind to promote his own glory, and the safety and happiness of his people.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/esther/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Translate it: "Likewise shall the princesses of Persia and Media, which have heard of the deed of the queen, say this day unto all the king's princes." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/esther/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13-19. Then the king said to the wise men&#8212;These were probably the magi, without whose advice as to the proper time of doing a thing the Persian kings never did take any step whatever; and the persons named in Es 1:14 were the "seven counsellors" (compare Ezr 7:14) who formed the state ministry. The combined wisdom of all, it seems, was enlisted to consult with the king what course should be taken after so unprecedented an occurrence as Vashti's disobedience of the royal summons. It is scarcely possible for us to imagine the astonishment produced by such a refusal in a country and a court where the will of the sovereign was absolute. The assembled grandees were petrified with horror at the daring affront. Alarm for the consequences that might ensue to each of them in his own household next seized on their minds; and the sounds of bacchanalian revelry were hushed into deep and anxious consultation what punishment to inflict on the refractory queen. But a purpose was to be served by the flattery of the king and the enslavement of all women. The counsellors were too intoxicated or obsequious to oppose the courtly advice of Memucan was unanimously resolved, with a wise regard to the public interests of the nation, that the punishment of Vashti could be nothing short of degradation from her royal dignity. The doom was accordingly pronounced and made known in all parts of the empire.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/esther/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Contempt</span> in the wives, and thereupon wrath in the husbands; and consequently strife in families; which may produce great and general mischiefs. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/esther/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Likewise shall the ladies of Persia and Media say this day unto the king's princes, which have heard of the deed of the queen,....
