We trifle, and proceed in it with many stops and pauses; but He that has begun the good work, will see it performed. Then spirits of just men will be made perfect.

The date here given is the 3rd of Adar (the 12th month) in the 6th year of Darius (516–515). The month Adar is about equivalent to our March. The name seems to be derived from an Assyrian god ‘Adar’, which appears in such names as Adrammelech. Haggai (<a href="/haggai/1-15.htm" title="In the four and twentieth day of the sixth month, in the second year of Darius the king.">Haggai 1:15</a>) mentions that the work had been recommenced on the 24th day of the 6th month (Elul = September) in the 2nd year of Darius. It had therefore been going on for nearly 4½ years. But the foundations had been laid twenty years previously, b.c. 536 (see <a href="/ezra/3-8.htm" title="Now in the second year of their coming to the house of God at Jerusalem, in the second month, began Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the remnant of their brothers the priests and the Levites, and all they that were come out of the captivity to Jerusalem; and appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to set forward the work of the house of the LORD.">Ezra 3:8</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Another date, the 23rd of Adar, is given in <a href="//apocrypha.org/1_esdras/7-5.htm" title="And thus was the holy house finished in the three and twentieth day of the month Adar, in the sixth year of Darius king of the Persians">1Es 7:5</a>. To account for this variation, it has been suggested that the last 8 days of the year would to a scribe seem best suited for the celebration of such a festival as that of the dedication (compare the 8 days in <a href="/2_chronicles/29-17.htm" title="Now they began on the first day of the first month to sanctify, and on the eighth day of the month came they to the porch of the LORD: so they sanctified the house of the LORD in eight days; and in the sixteenth day of the first month they made an end.">2 Chronicles 29:17</a>). In order that the regular services of the Temple might seem to have been resumed with the new year, he represented this festival as commencing on the 23rd of the 12th month. This is almost too ingenious. Either the figure ‘twenty’ has accidentally been omitted in the text of our verse, or, as seems equally probable (since the LXX. supports the Hebrew text here), the composer of 1 Esdras has mistaken some letter for the symbol or contraction which represented the number.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezra/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The house was finished on the third day of the month Adar. Haggai</span> (<a href="/haggai/1-15.htm">Haggai 1:15</a>) gives the exact day of the recommencement of the work as the twenty-fourth of Elul in Darius's second year. Ezra here gives the exact day of the completion. From Zerubbabel's laying of the foundation (<a href="/ezra/3-10.htm">Ezra 3:10</a>), the time that had elapsed was twenty-one years. From the recommencement under the inspiriting influence of the two prophets, the time was only four years, five months, and ten days. DEDICATION OF THE SECOND TEMPLE (<a href="/ezra/6-16.htm">Ezra 6:16-18</a>). Following the example of Solomon, who had solemnly "dedicated" the first temple (<a href="/1_kings/8-63.htm">1 Kings 8:63</a>), and had offered on the occasion a sacrifice unexampled for its magnitude in the whole of Jewish history (<span class="accented">ibid.</span>), Zerubbabel now, under the advice of two prophets, inaugurated the new building with a similar ceremony. In "the day of small things" it was not possible for him to emulate Solomon's magnificence in respect of the number of victims. Solomon had sacrificed 22,000 oxen and 120,000 sheep. Zerubbabel's means only enabled him to make an offering of 712 animals, more than half of them lambs. He did, however, according to his ability; and God, who accepts all our endeavours according to that we have, and not according to that we have not, was content to receive graciously the humble offering made to him, and to bless the building thus inaugurated with a glory unknown to the first temple. The Lord himself, the Messenger of the covenant, so long sought by his people, suddenly came to this temple (<a href="/malachi/3-1.htm">Malachi 3:1</a>) - came to it, and frequented it, and taught in it, and gave it a dignity and a majesty far beyond the first temple, which possessed indeed the Shechinah, but was once, and once only, vouchsafed a brief manifestation of the actual Divine presence (<a href="/2_chronicles/7-1.htm">2 Chronicles 7:1</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ezra/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"And what is needful, both young bullocks and rams and lambs, for the burnt-offerings of the God of leaven, wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the word of the priests at Jerusalem (i.e., as the priests shall require for the service of God), let it be given them day by day without fail." &#1502;&#1492; is joined with the plur. fem. of the partic. &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1503;, and is defined by the enumeration which follows. &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;, properly the anointing, then oil as the means of anointing.
