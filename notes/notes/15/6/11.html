The punishment here referred to is probably that of impalement, to which allusion is frequently made in Assyrian and Persian inscriptions. It may indeed be a form of crucifixion, such as is also implied in <a href="/genesis/40-19.htm" title="Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up your head from off you, and shall hang you on a tree; and the birds shall eat your flesh from off you.">Genesis 40:19</a> and <a href="/esther/2-23.htm" title="And when inquisition was made of the matter, it was found out; therefore they were both hanged on a tree: and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king.">Esther 2:23</a>.

The Hebrew and Aramaic word for ‘lift up’ which is used in a perfectly general sense for elevation of any sort, e.g. <a href="/psalms/145-14.htm" title="The LORD upholds all that fall, and raises up all those that be bowed down.">Psalm 145:14</a>; <a href="/psalms/146-8.htm" title="The LORD opens the eyes of the blind: the LORD raises them that are bowed down: the LORD loves the righteous:">Psalm 146:8</a>, and Targum of <a href="/psalms/93-3.htm" title="The floods have lifted up, O LORD, the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods lift up their waves.">Psalm 93:3</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/3-2.htm" title="Lift up your eyes to the high places, and see where you have not been lien with.

Then was the king's wrath pacified.">Esther 7:10</a>. This double meaning of the word may illustrate the Saviour’s word ‘I, if I be lifted up from the earth’ (<a href="/john/12-32.htm" title="And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to me.">John 12:32</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and let his house be made a dunghill for this</span>] See <a href="/2_kings/10-27.htm" title="And they broke down the image of Baal, and broke down the house of Baal, and made it a draught house to this day.">2 Kings 10:27</a>; <a href="/daniel/2-5.htm" title="The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if you will not make known to me the dream, with the interpretation thereof, you shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill.">Daniel 2:5</a>; <a href="/daniel/3-29.htm" title="Therefore I make a decree, That every people, nation, and language, which speak any thing amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill: because there is no other God that can deliver after this sort.">Daniel 3:29</a>.

Rather, "this edict." To alter the terms of a royal decree would in any country be a heinous offence. In Persia, where the monarch was absolute, and where decrees were regarded as "altering not" (<a href="/daniel/6-8.htm">Daniel 6:8, 12</a>), it was a crime of the deepest dye. Hence the severity of the punishment threatened. The punishment has been explained as crucifixion, impalement, and "whipping at a post;" but there seems to be no real doubt that crucifixion is intended. Great criminals were almost always crucified by the Persians (see Brisson, 'De Regno Persarum,' 2. pp. 327-329; and comp. 'Behist. Inscr.,' col. 2. par. 14; col. 3. par. 8). <span class="cmt_word">Let his house be made a dunghill</span> Some render "<span class="accented">be</span> confiscated," but wrongly. The best Hebraists agree with our translators. The practice of concluding important documents with maledictions was common to the Persians, with the Assyrians, Babylonians, and others (see 'Records of the Past,' vol. 1. pp. 53, 105, 126; vol. 5. p. 26; vol. 7. pp. 19, 20, 56; vol. 9. pp. 35, 36, 95, 100 107, etc.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 6:13-22 <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ezra/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"And also let the vessels ... be restored, and brought again to the temple at Jerusalem, to their place, and (thou) shalt place them in the house of God." On the matter of this verse, comp. <a href="/ezra/1-7.htm">Ezra 1:7</a> and <a href="/ezra/5-14.htm">Ezra 5:14</a>.

None but Sheshbazzar can be addressed (<a href="/ezra/5-15.htm">Ezra 5:15</a>), though he is not named in <a href="/ezra/6-3.htm">Ezra 6:3</a>. The historian is evidently not giving the contents of the document word for word, but only its essential matter; hence he infers the address to Sheshbazzar from the answer of the Jewish elders (<a href="/ezra/5-15.htm">Ezra 5:15</a>). Perhaps it was also remarked in the document, that Coresh caused the sacred vessels to be delivered to Sheshbazzar (<a href="/ezra/1-8.htm">Ezra 1:8</a>).</body></html>
