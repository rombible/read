Though the temple-service could not be performed with so much pomp, and such a multitude of sacrifices, and other oblations, as formerly, because of their poverty; yet perhaps it was performed with as much purity, and close adherence to the divine institution, as ever, which was the true glory of it. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/ezra/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:13-22 The gospel church, that spiritual temple, is long in the building, but it will be finished at last, when the mystical body is completed.

We trifle, and proceed in it with many stops and pauses; but He that has begun the good work, will see it performed. Then spirits of just men will be made perfect.

According to this arrangement, the service of the Temple was distributed by periods, of a week each, among the courses and divisions of priests and Levites (see <a href="/2_kings/11-9.htm" title="And the captains over the hundreds did according to all things that Jehoiada the priest commanded: and they took every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that should go out on the sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priest.">2 Kings 11:9</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/23-4.htm" title="This is the thing that you shall do; A third part of you entering on the sabbath, of the priests and of the Levites, shall be porters of the doors;">2 Chronicles 23:4</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>On the “divisions” of the priests, see <a href="/luke/1-5.htm" title="THERE was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth.">Luke 1:5</a>; <a href="/context/luke/1-8.htm" title="And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest's office before God in the order of his course,...">Luke 1:8-9</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">for the service of God</span>] ‘Service’, the same word as that rendered ‘work’ in <a href="/ezra/4-24.htm" title="Then ceased the work of the house of God which is at Jerusalem.

But there ‘the work of the house of God’ refers to he building; here ‘the work or service of God’ refers to the worship. Compare the word ‘liturgy’ (<span class="greekheb">λειτουργία</span>) and the growth of its special application.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">as it is written in the book of Moses</span>] The reference seems to be to the Levitical arrangements generally upon which the Davidic and Solomonic organization was founded, as described in the books of Chronicles.

This arrangement was based upon the ordinances of the law with respect to the respective offices of the two orders, as given in the Book of Numbers (<a href="/numbers/3-6.htm">Numbers 3:6-10</a>; <a href="/numbers/8-6.htm">Numbers 8:6-26</a>), and, so far, was <span class="cmt_word">according to the writing of the book of Moses.</span> But the "courses" themselves were not established till David's time. CELEBRATION OF THE PASSOVER IN THE ENSUING MONTH, AND OBSERVANCE OF THE FEAST OF UNLEAVENED BREAD (<a href="/ezra/6-19.htm">Ezra 6:19-22</a>). Specially solemn passovers were celebrated on specially solemn occasions; and these received special record at the hands of the sacred writers. Of this kind are the passover celebrated By Hezekiah in the year  <span class="date">B.C. 726</span>, recorded in <a href="/2_chronicles/30.htm">2 Chronicles 30</a>, and that celebrated by Josiah in  <span class="date">B.C. 624</span>, recorded in <a href="/2_chronicles/35.htm">2 Chronicles 35</a>. Both of these followed upon a cleansing of the temple, and restoration of the temple worship after a period of suspension. Ezra seems to place the passover of  <span class="date">B.C. 516</span> in the same category. It marked the period of the full re-establishment of the regular ordinances of religion, more or less interrupted from the time of the destruction of the temple by Nebuchadnezzar. It terminated the abnormal and commenced the normal condition of things. Perhaps it is to mark this, that Ezra at this point disuses the Chaldee dialect, which he had introduced in ch. 4:8, and returns to the Hebrew, the established language of the Jewish religion. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ezra/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Finally, Darius adds the threat: "The God who has caused His name to dwell there, destroy every king and (every) people that shall stretch forth the hand to alter (this command), to destroy this house of God at Jerusalem." The expression, "the God who has caused His name to dwell there," is indeed specifically Israelitish (comp. <a href="/deuteronomy/12-11.htm">Deuteronomy 12:11</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/14-23.htm">Deuteronomy 14:23</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/7-12.htm">Jeremiah 7:12</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/1-9.htm">Nehemiah 1:9</a>), and therefore undoubtedly originated with the Jewish historian; but the matter itself, the wish that God Himself would destroy him who should injure His temple, recalls the close of the inscription of Bisitun, wherein the judgments of Ahuramazda are imprecated upon him who should dare to injure the image and inscription, and his blessing invoked upon him who should respect them (Berth.). </body></html>
