It appears from many passages of Scripture, that though Shalmaneser had carried captive the ten tribes, yet many of them had remained in their country, and were carried away by Nebuchadnezzar, together with Judah and Benjamin, with whom they returned out of Babylon, as many others of the ten tribes did, who were carried away at the taking of Samaria.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/ezra/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:13-22 The gospel church, that spiritual temple, is long in the building, but it will be finished at last, when the mystical body is completed. Every believer is a living temple, building up himself in his most holy faith: much opposition is given to this work by Satan and our own corruptions. We trifle, and proceed in it with many stops and pauses; but He that has begun the good work, will see it performed. Then spirits of just men will be made perfect. By getting their sins taken away, the Jews would free themselves from the sting of their late troubles. Their service was with joy.

So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of the LORD.">1 Kings 8:63</a>). Solomon offered then for ‘the sacrifice of peace-offerings … two and twenty thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep’. The numbers also mentioned in connexion with the dedication-festivals of Hezekiah (<a href="/2_chronicles/30-24.htm" title="For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the congregation a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep: and a great number of priests sanctified themselves.">2 Chronicles 30:24</a>) and Josiah (<a href="/2_chronicles/35-7.htm" title="And Josiah gave to the people, of the flock, lambs and kids, all for the passover offerings, for all that were present, to the number of thirty thousand, and three thousand bullocks: these were of the king's substance.">2 Chronicles 35:7</a>) very largely exceed the offerings of Zerubbabel and his companions.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The decay of material wealth and splendour must have vividly impressed itself upon the mind of many a patriot Jew, who looked only for a renewal of worldly empire. To them it must have seemed ‘a day of small things’ (<a href="/zechariah/4-10.htm" title="For who has despised the day of small things? for they shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel with those seven; they are the eyes of the LORD, which run to and fro through the whole earth.">Zechariah 4:10</a>) by the side of the recollections of the kingdom.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">a sin offering for all Israel, twelve he goats</span> &c.] Compare <a href="/numbers/7-87.htm" title="All the oxen for the burnt offering were twelve bullocks, the rams twelve, the lambs of the first year twelve, with their meat offering: and the kids of the goats for sin offering twelve.">Numbers 7:87</a>, ‘and the males of the goats for a sin-offering twelve’, at the dedication of the altar. It is noticeable that in the reign of Hezekiah, at the purification of the Temple, we are told ‘they brought seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven lambs, and seven he-goats, for a sin offering for the kingdom and for the sanctuary and for Judah’ (<a href="/2_chronicles/29-21.htm" title="And they brought seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven lambs, and seven he goats, for a sin offering for the kingdom, and for the sanctuary, and for Judah. And he commanded the priests the sons of Aaron to offer them on the altar of the LORD.">2 Chronicles 29:21</a>). The number ‘seven’ there denotes the consecration, the number ‘twelve’ here denotes the ideal unity, of the community. The sin offering ‘of twelve he-goats according to the number of the tribes of Israel’, was an incident full of deep religious pathos. The remnant who had returned make solemn confession of sin in the name of the whole scattered and dispersed race. They acknowledge the essential unity of Israel’s tribes alike in the consequences of sin, in the possibilities of restoration, and in the renewed consecration to God’s service.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The symbolical representation of a restored and ideal Israel is thus indicated by the verse (cf. <a href="/ezra/2-2.htm" title="Which came with Zerubbabel: Jeshua, Nehemiah, Seraiah, Reelaiah, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mizpar, Bigvai, Rehum, Baanah. The number of the men of the people of Israel:">Ezra 2:2</a>; <a href="/ezra/2-70.htm" title="So the priests, and the Levites, and some of the people, and the singers, and the porters, and the Nethinims, dwelled in their cities, and all Israel in their cities.">Ezra 2:70</a>, <a href="/ezra/8-35.htm" title="Also the children of those that had been carried away, which were come out of the captivity, offered burnt offerings to the God of Israel, twelve bullocks for all Israel, ninety and six rams, seventy and seven lambs, twelve he goats for a sin offering: all this was a burnt offering to the LORD.">Ezra 8:35</a>). We need not necessarily assume (as some commentators) that each tribe was literally represented upon the occasion. Compare the prophet’s picture of a reunited Israel (<a href="/context/ezekiel/37-15.htm" title="The word of the LORD came again to me, saying,...">Ezekiel 37:15-28</a>) and Elijah’s offering on Mt. Carmel, <a href="/1_kings/18-31.htm" title="And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom the word of the LORD came, saying, Israel shall be your name:">1 Kings 18:31</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezra/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And offered...  an hundred bullocks, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs.</span> A poor offering, if it be compared, not alone with Solomon's (<a href="/1_kings/8-63.htm">1 Kings 8:63</a>), but even with Hezekiah's (<a href="/2_chronicles/30-24.htm">2 Chronicles 30:24</a>), or Josiah's (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> 35:7). Hundreds now take the place of the thousands offered under the old monarchy. <span class="cmt_word">A</span> <span class="cmt_word">sin offering for all Israel.</span> See comment on ver. 16. We may assume that some of every tribe had returned with Zerubbabel, and that consequently it was possible to regard the re-established people as "Israel" (comp. <a href="/nehemiah/11-20.htm">Nehemiah 11:20</a>; <a href="/zechariah/8-13.htm">Zechariah 8:13</a>; <a href="/malachi/1-1.htm">Malachi 1:1</a>); though, since the great majority were Jews, they were more commonly spoken of as "Judah" (<a href="/ezra/4-1.htm">Ezra 4:1, 6, 23</a>; <a href="/ezra/5-1.htm">Ezra 5:1, 5</a>; <a href="/ezra/6-7.htm">Ezra 6:7, 14</a>; <a href="/zechariah/8-15.htm">Zechariah 8:15</a>, etc.). Zerubbabel, desirous of emphasising the nobler and grander view, made this solemn sin offering of twelve he-goats, one for each of the tribes. Ezra acted similarly when he brought the second colony (<span class="accented">infra</span>, <a href="/ezra/8-35.htm">Ezra 8:35</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ezra/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>To inculcate obedience to his command, Darius threatens to punish its transgression with death: "If any one alters this command, let a beam be torn from his house, and let him be fastened hanging thereon." To alter a command means to transgress or abolish it. &#1488;&#1506;, a piece of wood, a beam. &#1494;&#1511;&#1497;&#1507;, raised on high, is in Syriac the usual word for crucified, and is to be so understood here. &#1502;&#1495;&#1488;, to strike, with &#1506;&#1500;, strike upon, fasten to, nail to. This kind of capital punishment was customary among the Assyrians (Diod. Sic. ii. 1), the ancient Persians, and many other nations, but seems to have been executed in different manners among different people. Among the Assyrians it generally consisted in the impalement of the delinquent upon a sharp strong wooden post; comp. Layard, Nineveh and Babylon, p. 355, and Nineveh and its Remains, p. 379, with the illustration fig. 58. According to Herod. iii. 159, Darius impaled as many as 3000 Babylonians after the capture of their city (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;). Crucifixion proper, however, i.e., nailing to a cross, also occurred among the Persians; it was, however, practised by nailing the body of the criminal to a cross after decapitation; see the passages from Herodotus in Brissonii de regio Persarum princip. l. ii. c. 215. "And let his house be made a dunghill." See remarks on <a href="/daniel/2-5.htm">Daniel 2:5</a> and <a href="/2_kings/10-27.htm">2 Kings 10:27</a>.</body></html>
