While our thoughts are directed to this event, we are led by Zechariah to fix our regard on a nobler, a spiritual building. The Lord Jesus Christ continues to lay one stone upon another: let us assist the great design. Difficulties delay the progress of this sacred edifice. Yet let not opposition discourage us, for in due season it will be completed to his abundant praise.

Some regard it as a "course," and suppose that after every three courses of stone there followed a course of timber. Others understand three "storeys" of stone, with a fourth "storey" of woodwork on the summit (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/6-5.htm">1 Kings 6:5-6</a>).

Achmetha&#8212;long supposed to be the capital of Greater Media (the Ecbatana of classical, the Hamadan of modern times), [is] at the foot of the Elwund range of hills, where, for its coolness and salubrity, Cyrus and his successors on the Persian throne established their summer residence. There was another city, however, of this name, the Ecbatana of Atropatene, and the most ancient capital of northern Media, and recently identified by Colonel Rawlinson in the remarkable ruins of Takht-i-Soleiman. Yet as everything tends to show the attachment of Cyrus to his native city, the Atropatenian Ecbatana, rather than to the stronger capital of Greater Media, Colonel Rawlinson is inclined to think that he deposited there, in his fortress, the famous decree relating to the Jews, along with the other records and treasures of his empire [Nineveh and Persepolis].<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ezra/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">With three rows of great stones, and a row of new timber; </span> as Solomon’s temple was built, <span class="bld"><a href="/1_kings/6-36.htm" title="And he built the inner court with three rows of hewed stone, and a row of cedar beams.">1 Kings 6:36</a></span>; whereof Darius was informed by some of the Jews, who also desired that it might be done in this manner. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/ezra/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>With three rows of great stones,....

To be defrayed probably from the purse of the ‘Abhar Nahara’ satrapy. This payment had obviously ceased, or its existence would have been known to Tattenai and the other officials. During the disturbances which took place at the close of Cyrus’s reign, the officers of the provincial treasury probably found it convenient to stop this annual contribution. The voluntary subscriptions mentioned in <a href="/context/ezra/2-68.htm" title="And some of the chief of the fathers, when they came to the house of the LORD which is at Jerusalem, offered freely for the house of God to set it up in his place:...">Ezra 2:68-69</a> would therefore have been rendered necessary.

The two wings of the temple of Solomon were undoubtedly three storeys high (<a href="/1_kings/6-6.htm">1 Kings 6:6</a>). But it is perhaps doubtful whether the word <span class="accented">nidbak</span> ever means "storey." Most commentators suppose three <span class="accented">courses</span> of stone, and then a course of timber, repeated from foundation to summit; but there is no known example of such a mode of building.
