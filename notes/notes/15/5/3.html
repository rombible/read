This should keep us to our duty, and encourage us therein, when difficulties are ever so discouraging. The elders of the Jews gave the Samaritans an account of their proceedings. Let us learn hence, with meekness and fear, to give a reason of the hope that is in us; let us rightly understand, and then readily declare, what we do in God's service, and why we do it. And while in this world, we always shall have to confess, that our sins have provoked the wrath of God. All our sufferings spring from thence, and all our comforts from his unmerited mercy. However the work may seem to be hindered, yet the Lord Jesus Christ is carrying it on, his people are growing unto a holy temple in the Lord, for a habitation of God through the Spirit.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ezra/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Governor on this side the river - Compare <a href="/ezra/4-10.htm">Ezra 4:10</a> note.

At the same time came to them Tatnai, governor on this side the river&#8212;The Persian empire west of the Euphrates included at this time Syria, Arabia, Egypt, Phœnicia, and other provinces subject to Darius. The empire was divided into twenty provinces, called satrapies. Syria formed one satrapy, inclusive of Palestine, Phœnicia, and Cyprus, and furnished an annual revenue of three hundred fifty talents. It was presided over by a satrap or viceroy, who at this time resided at Damascus. Though superior to the native governors of the Jews appointed by the Persian king, he never interfered with their internal government except when there was a threatened disturbance of order and tranquillity. Tatnai, the governor (whether this was a personal name or an official title is unknown), had probably been incited by the complaints and turbulent outrages of the Samaritans against the Jews; but he suspended his judgment, and he prudently resolved to repair to Jerusalem, that he might ascertain the real state of matters by personal inspection and enquiry, in company with another dignified officer and his provincial council.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ezra/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="ital">Tatuai and Shethar-boznai</span>; not Rehum and Shimshai &c., who were either dead, or removed from their offices by the new emperor Darius, as is very usual. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/ezra/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>At the same time came to them Tatnai, governor on this side the river, and Shetharboznai, and their companions,....

The name is not found except in this connexion. He was governor (probably satrap) of the whole district of Syria and Cilicia on the west of the Euphrates. There were twenty satrapies in the Persian kingdom (Herod. III. 89). Tattenai was therefore a man of the greatest eminence in Syria, next to the king himself. The expression ‘governor beyond the river’ is not due to the writer living on the eastern or Babylonian side of the river. It was the technical title of the governor of that satrapy. It appears on the coins of the Persian empire. Thus upon one coin appears the inscription “Maydi who is over the ‘Abhar Nahara’ (country beyond the River) and Cilicia”.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Tattenai was the superior official, to whom Zerubbabel, the pekhah or governor of the small district of Jerusalem and its neighbourhood, would have to give account upon any report being made of treacherous action.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Shethar-boznai</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">Shethar-bozenai.</span> <a href="//apocrypha.org/1_esdras/6-3.htm" title="At the same time came unto them Sisinnes the governor of Syria and Phenice, with Sathrabuzanes and his companions, and said unto them,">1Es 6:3</a>, ‘Sathrabuzanes’, LXX. <span class="greekheb">Σαθαρβουζαναί</span>, has been conjectured to be the Persian ‘Chitrabarschana’ (cf. a Persian name, ‘Satibarzanes’, in Arrian).

Seventeen or eighteen years had elapsed since Cyrus issued his decree. Two other kings had succeeded him. The third, Darius, was only just assuring his position upon the throne after two years of incessant warring.

The etymology is uncertain, but seems not to be Semitic (see Pusey's 'Daniel,' pp. 570-572). The respective rank of Tatnai and Zerub-babel is indicated, not by this term, but by what follows it. Tatnai was <span class="accented">pechah</span> "<span class="accented">be</span>yond the river," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> governor of the whole tract west of the Euphrates; Zerubbabel was <span class="accented">pechah</span> of Judah only.
