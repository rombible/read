Perhaps the latter view is the more probable; and we may suppose Tatnai not to have been aware that from the second year of Cyrus to the commencement of the reign of Smerdis, and again during the latter part of this reign and the first eighteen months of the reign of Darius, the work had been suspended. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ezra/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Hereupon the royal officials asked the elders of the Jews who had commanded them to build, and inquired concerning their names, that they might write to the king the names of the leading men (see the remark on 3 and 41). &#1489;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;&#1501; &#1491;&#1468;&#1497; does not mean, who are at the head of them: but, who act in the capacity of heads. </body></html>
