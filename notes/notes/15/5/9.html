This should keep us to our duty, and encourage us therein, when difficulties are ever so discouraging. The elders of the Jews gave the Samaritans an account of their proceedings. Let us learn hence, with meekness and fear, to give a reason of the hope that is in us; let us rightly understand, and then readily declare, what we do in God's service, and why we do it. And while in this world, we always shall have to confess, that our sins have provoked the wrath of God. All our sufferings spring from thence, and all our comforts from his unmerited mercy. However the work may seem to be hindered, yet the Lord Jesus Christ is carrying it on, his people are growing unto a holy temple in the Lord, for a habitation of God through the Spirit.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ezra/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Great stones - literally, as in the margin; i. e., stones so large that they were rolled along, not carried.

Tatnai (lxx &#x398;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#836;&#769;) was &#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1492;, viceroy, in the provinces west of Euphrates, i.e., as correctly expanded in 1 Esdras, of Syria and Phoenicia, to which Judaea with its Pecha Zerubbabel was subordinate. With him came Shethar-Boznai, perhaps his secretary, and their companions, their subordinates. The royal officials inquired: "Who has commanded you to build this house, and to finish this wall?" The form &#1500;&#1489;&#1504;&#1488; here and <a href="/ezra/5-13.htm">Ezra 5:13</a> is remarkable, the infinitive in Chaldee being not &#1489;&#1504;&#1488;, but&#1502;&#1489;&#1504;&#1488;; compare <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/5-2.htm">Ezra 5:2</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/5-17.htm">Ezra 5:17</a>, and <a href="/ezra/6-8.htm">Ezra 6:8</a>.

The Vulgate, the Syriac, and also the Rabbins, translate: these walls. This meaning best answers to the context, and is also linguistically the most correct. It can hardly, however, be derived (Gesenius) from &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, but rather from &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1503;, in Chaldee &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;, firm, strong-walls as the strength or firmness of the building. The form &#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1512;&#1504;&#1488; has arisen from &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1468;&#1488;, and is analogous to the form &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492;.<p>(Note: The interpretations of the lxx, &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;, meaning these building materials, and of 1 Esdr. 6:4, &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;, this roof and all besides, for which Bertheau decides, without considering that &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1500;&#1500; may mean to complete, and not to prepare for anything, are but conjectures.)</body></html>
