This should keep us to our duty, and encourage us therein, when difficulties are ever so discouraging. The elders of the Jews gave the Samaritans an account of their proceedings. Let us learn hence, with meekness and fear, to give a reason of the hope that is in us; let us rightly understand, and then readily declare, what we do in God's service, and why we do it. And while in this world, we always shall have to confess, that our sins have provoked the wrath of God. All our sufferings spring from thence, and all our comforts from his unmerited mercy. However the work may seem to be hindered, yet the Lord Jesus Christ is carrying it on, his people are growing unto a holy temple in the Lord, for a habitation of God through the Spirit.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ezra/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Great stones - literally, as in the margin; i. e., stones so large that they were rolled along, not carried.

From &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1504;&#1488;, we said, it is obvious that the author of this account was an eye-witness of, and sharer in, the work of building. These is not a shadow of reason for altering &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1504;&#1488; into &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;, or into the participle &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1503; (Ew., Berth., and others); the &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; of the lxx being no critical authority for so doing. The answer in <a href="/ezra/5-4.htm">Ezra 5:4</a> seems not to correspond with the question in <a href="/ezra/5-3.htm">Ezra 5:3</a>. The royal officials asked, Who had commanded them to build? The Jews told them the names of those who had undertaken and were conducting the building. But this incongruity between the question and answer is merely caused by the fact that the discussion is reported only by a short extract restricted to the principal subjects. We learn that this is the case from the contents of the letter sent by the officials to the king. According to these, the royal functionary inquired not merely concerning the author of the command to build, but asked also the names of those who were undertaking the work (comp. <a href="/ezra/5-9.htm">Ezra 5:9</a> and <a href="/ezra/5-10.htm">Ezra 5:10</a>); while the rulers of the Jews gave a circumstantial answer to both questions (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/5-11.htm">Ezra 5:11-15</a>).</body></html>
