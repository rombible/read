The temptation was to some to stay in Babylon; but some feared not to return, and they were those whose spirits God raised, by his Spirit and grace. Whatever good we do, is owing to the grace of God. Our spirits naturally bow down to this earth and the things of it; if they move upward in any good affections or good actions, it is God who raises them. The calls and offers of the gospel are like the proclamation of Cyrus. Those bound under the power of sin, may be made free by Jesus Christ. Whosoever will, by repentance and faith, return to God, Jesus Christ has opened the way for him, and raises him out of the slavery of sin into the glorious liberty of the children of God. Many that hear this joyful sound, choose to sit still in Babylon, are in love with their sins, and will not venture upon a holy life; but some break through all discouragements, whatever it cost them; they are those whose spirit God has raised above the world and the flesh, whom he has made willing. Thus will the heavenly Canaan be filled, though many perish in Babylon; and the gospel offer will not have been made in vain. The bringing back the Jews from captivity, represents the redemption of sinners by Jesus Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ezra/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Only a portion of the Israelites took advantage of the permission of Cyrus.

Then rose up the chief of the fathers, &c.&#8212;The paternal and ecclesiastical chiefs of the later captivity, those of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, with some also from other tribes (1Ch 9:3), who retained their attachment to the pure worship of God, naturally took the lead in this movement. Their example was followed by all whose piety and patriotism were strong enough to brave the various discouragements attending the enterprise. They were liberally assisted by multitudes of their captive countrymen, who, born in Babylonia or comfortably established in it by family connections or the possession of property, chose to remain. It seems that their Assyrian friends and neighbors, too, either from a favorable disposition toward the Jewish faith, or from imitation of the court policy, displayed hearty good will and great liberality in aiding and promoting the views of the emigrants.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ezra/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Strengthened their hands; </span> either because they had embraced, or at least favoured the Jewish religion, concerning which they were instructed by the Israelites that had now for a long time dwelt among them; or rather, that they might hereby gratify the king’s humour, and purchase his favour; for they perceived him to be hearty and forward in the work. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/ezra/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And all they that were about them,....

And they said, Let us rise up and build. So they strengthened their hands for this good work.">Nehemiah 2:18</a>, ‘So they strengthened their hands for the good work’; <a href="/jeremiah/23-14.htm" title="I have seen also in the prophets of Jerusalem an horrible thing: they commit adultery, and walk in lies: they strengthen also the hands of evildoers, that none does return from his wickedness; they are all of them to me as Sodom, and the inhabitants thereof as Gomorrah.">Jeremiah 23:14</a>, ‘they strengthen the hands of evil doers’. In those passages the idea is simply that of ‘invigorating’ and ‘adding strength’. Here the employment of a preposition introduces a shade of variety into the metaphor. The idea is that of ‘grasping’, ‘laying firm hold on the hand with the view of strengthening or supporting’. The Jews who sought to return were like a convalescent essaying to walk and needing assistance. Cf. <a href="/isaiah/51-18.htm" title="There is none to guide her among all the sons whom she has brought forth; neither is there any that takes her by the hand of all the sons that she has brought up.">Isaiah 51:18</a>, ‘There is none that taketh her by the hand of all the sons that she hath brought up’.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">vessels of silver, with gold</span>] we should expect ‘with vessels of gold’, cf. <a href="/ezra/1-9.htm" title="And this is the number of them: thirty chargers of gold, a thousand chargers of silver, nine and twenty knives,">Ezra 1:9</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">with goods</span>] see <a href="/ezra/1-4.htm" title="And whoever remains in any place where he sojournes, let the men of his place help him with silver, and with gold, and with goods, and with beasts, beside the freewill offering for the house of God that is in Jerusalem.">Ezra 1:4</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and with precious things</span>] A rare word in the original, ‘migdânoth’. It occurs in <a href="/2_chronicles/21-3.htm" title="And their father gave them great gifts of silver, and of gold, and of precious things, with fenced cities in Judah: but the kingdom gave he to Jehoram; because he was the firstborn.">2 Chronicles 21:3</a> = A.V. and R.V. <span class="ital">precious things</span>, <a href="/2_chronicles/32-23.htm" title="And many brought gifts to the LORD to Jerusalem, and presents to Hezekiah king of Judah: so that he was magnified in the sight of all nations from thereafter.">2 Chronicles 32:23</a> = A.V. <span class="ital">presents</span>, R.V. <span class="ital">precious things</span>. And in a well-known passage, <a href="/genesis/24-53.htm" title="And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah: he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things.">Genesis 24:53</a> = A.V. and R.V. <span class="ital">precious things</span>. The Latin here ‘in supellectili’ is a mere guess. The LXX. rendering ‘<span class="greekheb">ἐν ξενίοις</span>’ = with gifts agrees with their rendering <span class="greekheb">δῶρα</span> in Gen., and <span class="greekheb">δόματα</span> in 2 Chronicles 32. In <a href="/2_chronicles/21-3.htm" title="And their father gave them great gifts of silver, and of gold, and of precious things, with fenced cities in Judah: but the kingdom gave he to Jehoram; because he was the firstborn.">2 Chronicles 21:3</a> they render by <span class="greekheb">ὅπλα</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">beside all</span> that <span class="ital">was willingly offered</span>] i.e. these gifts were over and above the free-will offerings. The clause in the original is peculiar, ‘beside over and above all <span class="ital">one</span> willingly offered’. The relative is omitted as in <a href="/ezra/1-4.htm" title="And whoever remains in any place where he sojournes, let the men of his place help him with silver, and with gold, and with goods, and with beasts, beside the freewill offering for the house of God that is in Jerusalem.">Ezra 1:4</a>, but is implied in ‘all’. The verb is active in meaning (cf. <a href="/ezra/2-68.htm" title="And some of the chief of the fathers, when they came to the house of the LORD which is at Jerusalem, offered freely for the house of God to set it up in his place:">Ezra 2:68</a>, <a href="/ezra/3-5.htm" title="And afterward offered the continual burnt offering, both of the new moons, and of all the set feasts of the LORD that were consecrated, and of every one that willingly offered a freewill offering to the LORD.">Ezra 3:5</a>) and is here used impersonally.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezra/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All they that were about them.</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> all their neighbours. <span class="cmt_word">Strengthened their hands. </span>This is the literal rendering.

The gold, silver, precious things, etc. previously mentioned were free gifts to individual Jews, and were additional to certain offerings which were intrusted to them for conveyance to Jerusalem. On the value attached by the Persians to offerings made in Jerusalem to Jehovah, see below, <a href="/ezra/6-10.htm">Ezra 6:10</a>, and Ezra 7:17. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_chronicles/36.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>To point out still further how exactly God had fulfilled His word by the mouth of the prophet Jeremiah, it is in conclusion briefly mentioned that God, in the first year of Coresh king of Persia, stirred up the spirit of this king to cause a command to go forth in all his kingdom, that Jahve, the God of heaven, who had given him all the kingdoms of the earth, had commanded him to build again His temple in Jerusalem, and that whoever belonged to the people of God might go up to Jerusalem. With this comforting prospect for the future, the author of the Chronicle closes his consideration of the prae-exilic history of the people of God without completely communicating the contents of the royal edict of Cyrus, since he purposed to narrate the history of the restoration of Judah to their own land in a separate work. This we have in the book of Ezra, which commences by giving us the whole of the edict of Cyrus the king of the Persians (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/1-1.htm">Ezra 1:1-3</a>), and then narrates the return of a great part of the people to Jerusalem and Judah, the rebuilding of the temple, and the re-settlement in the land of their fathers of those who had returned. </body></html>
