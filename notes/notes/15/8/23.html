Those who seek God, are safe under the shadow of his wings, even in their greatest dangers; but those who forsake him, are always exposed. When entering upon any new state of life, our care should be, to bring none of the guilt of the sins of our former condition into it. When we are in any peril, let us be at peace with God, and then nothing can do us any real hurt. All our concerns about ourselves, our families, and our estates, it is our wisdom and duty, by prayer to commit to God, and to leave the care of them with him. And, on some occasions, we should decline advantages which are within our reach, lest we should cause others to stumble, and so our God be dishonoured. Let us ask wisdom of God, that we may know how to use or to refuse lawful things. We shall be no losers by venturing, suffering, or giving up for the Lord's sake. Their prayers were answered, and the event declared it. Never have any that sought God in earnest, found that they sought him in vain.

But Ezra had spoken so much to the king of the sufficiency of the divine care of His people that he would have blushed to apply for a guard of soldiers. Therefore he resolved that his followers should, by a solemn act of fasting and prayer, commit themselves to the Keeper of Israel. Their faith, considering the many and constant perils of a journey across the Bedouin regions, must have been great, and it was rewarded by the enjoyment of perfect safety during the whole way.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ezra/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> He gave us some assurance of his gracious answer to our request. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/ezra/8.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>So we fasted, and besought our God for this,....

When the Israelites who were about to return to Jerusalem had assembled, and were ready for starting, Ezra perceived that there were no Levites among them. He then sent for certain chief men among them, and by means of the influence of Iddo, the chief at the place Casiphia, induced a number of Levites and Nethinim to determine on joining the expedition (<a href="/ezra/8-15.htm">Ezra 8:15</a>). He then proclaimed a fast at the place of meeting, for the purpose of supplicating God to grant them a prosperous journey (<a href="/ezra/8-21.htm">Ezra 8:21</a>).<p><a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/8-15.htm">Ezra 8:15-17</a><p>The travellers assembled at the river Ahava, where they encamped three days. In <a href="/ezra/8-15.htm">Ezra 8:15</a> the river is designated &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1492;&#1493;&#1488; &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1488;, i.e., either which comes (flows) towards Ahava, or flows into Ahava; in <a href="/ezra/8-21.htm">Ezra 8:21</a> it is more briefly called &#1488;&#1492;&#1493;&#1488; &#1504;&#1492;&#1512;, and in <a href="/ezra/8-31.htm">Ezra 8:31</a> &#1488;&#1492;&#1493;&#1488; &#1504;&#1492;&#1512;, which may mean the river of Ahava, of the region or district called Ahava, or, after the analogy of &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514; &#1504;&#1492;&#1512;, merely the river of the name of Ahava. It is doubtful which of these meanings is correct, the name Ahava being still unexplained. Comp. the various conjectures in A. G. F. Schirmer, observationes exeg. crit. in libr. Esdrae, Vratisl. 1820, p. 28ff. The connection points to a place or district in the neighbourhood of Babylon; hence Bertheau is inclined to regard Ahava as a tributary or canal of the Euphrates, flowing through a place, perhaps only a field or open space, of the same name, in the immediate neighbourhood of Babylon; while Ewald supposes it may be the river somewhat to the west or south of Euphrates, called by the Greeks Pallacopas, whose situation would suit the context, and whose name might arise from &#1488;&#1492;&#1493;&#1488; &#1508;&#1500;&#1490;, the river Ahwa or Aba. The lxx gives the name &#x395;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3b9;&#769;; in 1 Esdr. 8:40 and 61 we find &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;, evidently a false reading. Josephus says quite generally, &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x395;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;. - When Ezra, during the three days' encampment at this place, directed his attention to the people and the priests (&#1489; &#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1503;, to give heed, <a href="/nehemiah/13-7.htm">Nehemiah 13:7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/9-23.htm">Daniel 9:23</a>, and elsewhere), he found no Levites among those who had assembled. <a href="/ezra/8-16.htm">Ezra 8:16</a> He then sent several chief men to Iddo, the chief man in the place Casiphia, to beg him and his brethren to bring him servants for the house of God. The lxx translates &#1500; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495;&#1492;, "I sent to (or for) Eliezer," etc., which would mean to fetch them: "that I might then send them to Iddo." The Vulgate, on the other hand, and many expositors, understand &#1500; as nota accus., like <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-7.htm">2 Chronicles 17:7</a>, which is simpler. Of the nine men here designated as &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;, the names of Eliezer, Shemaiah, Jarib, Nathan, Zechariah, and Meshullam occur again in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/10-15.htm">Ezra 10:15</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/10-18.htm">Ezra 10:18-31</a>, though we cannot certainly infer the identify of those who bear them. The appellation &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; does not determine whether they belonged to the priesthood or laity. The two remaining are called &#1502;&#1489;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, teachers; comp. <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-7.htm">Nehemiah 8:7</a>, <a href="/nehemiah/8-9.htm">Nehemiah 8:9</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/15-22.htm">1 Chronicles 15:22</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/25-8.htm">1 Chronicles 25:8</a>, and elsewhere. Although this word is, in the passages cited, used of Levites, yet we cannot suppose those here named to have been teaching Levites, because, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/8-16.htm">Ezra 8:16</a>, there were as yet no Levites amongst the assemblage; hence, too, they could not be teachers properly so called, but only men of wisdom and understanding. The Chethiv &#1493;&#1488;&#1493;&#1510;&#1488;&#1492; must be read &#1493;&#1488;&#1493;&#1510;&#1488;&#1492;: I sent them to (&#1506;&#1500;, according to later usage, for &#1488;&#1500;); the Keri is &#1493;&#1488;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492;, I despatched, sent them. Both readings suit the sense. The place Casiphia is entirely unknown, but cannot have been far from the river Ahava. Caspia, the region of the Caspian Sea, is out of the question, being far too remote. "I put words in their mouth to speak to Iddo," i.e., I told them exactly what they should say to Iddo; comp. <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-3.htm">2 Samuel 14:3</a>, <a href="/2_samuel/14-19.htm">2 Samuel 14:19</a>. The words &#1488;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493; &#1488;&#1495;&#1497;&#1493; &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; give no intelligible meaning; for &#1488;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493; we must, with the Vulgate, 1 Esdras, and others, read &#1493;&#1488;&#1495;&#1497;&#1493;: to Iddo and his brethren, the Nethinim, at the place Casiphia. This would seem to say that Iddo was one of the Nethinim. Such an inference is not, however, a necessary one; for the expression may also, like "Zadok the (high) priest and his brethren, the (ordinary) priests," <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-39.htm">1 Chronicles 16:39</a>, be understood to mean that Iddo, the chief man of that place, was a Levite, and that the Nethinim were, as a lower order of temple servants, called brethren of Iddo the Levite. The circumstance that not only Nethinim, but also Levites, were induced by Iddo to join the expedition (<a href="/ezra/8-8.htm">Ezra 8:8</a>), requires us thus to understand the words. &#1488;&#1500; &#1500;&#1489;&#1497;&#1514; &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501;, servants for the house of God, are Levites and Nethinim, the upper and lower orders of the temple ministers. From <a href="/ezra/8-17.htm">Ezra 8:17</a> it appears that both Levites and Nethinim had settled in the place Casiphia, and that Iddo, as the chief man of the place, held an influential position among them. No further inferences, however, concerning their settlement and employment can be drawn from this circumstance.</body></html>
