The A.V. combines the two readings.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The variety of reading arises from the uncertainty felt as to the true rendering of the previous verse. The rendering ‘then sent I for’ in that verse requires in this verse the reading ‘And I sent them forth’ (C’thib). The rendering ‘then sent I’ could be followed by either ‘I sent them forth’ or ‘I gave them commandment’ (K’ri), the latter being less a repetition of the previous sentence.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Supposing that “I gave them commandment” was the original reading, we can see that, when the Hebrew idiom in <a href="/ezra/8-16.htm" title="Then sent I for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for Elnathan, and for Jarib, and for Elnathan, and for Nathan, and for Zechariah, and for Meshullam, chief men; also for Joiarib, and for Elnathan, men of understanding.">Ezra 8:16</a> ‘then sent I’ (the object expressed by a preposition) dropped out of sight and the literal translation seemed to be “then sent I for”, a reason was given for the very slight alteration, by which “I gave them commandment” was altered to “I sent them forth” (LXX. <span class="greekheb">ἐξήνεγκα</span>). This accounts for the existence of the two readings, and for the prevalence of that accepted in the R.V. text. But the R.V. margin seems preferable. It gives a natural sense and agrees well with what precedes and follows. On the other hand the alternative reading “I sent them forth” represents a word of great frequency in the sense of ‘bring forth or out’ (e.g. <a href="/ezra/1-7.htm" title="Also Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of the LORD, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of Jerusalem, and had put them in the house of his gods;">Ezra 1:7</a>, <a href="/ezra/10-3.htm" title="Now therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away all the wives, and such as are born of them, according to the counsel of my lord, and of those that tremble at the commandment of our God; and let it be done according to the law.">Ezra 10:3</a>; <a href="/ezra/10-19.htm" title="And they gave their hands that they would put away their wives; and being guilty, they offered a ram of the flock for their trespass.">Ezra 10:19</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/9-7.htm" title="You are the LORD the God, who did choose Abram, and brought him forth out of Ur of the Chaldees, and gave him the name of Abraham;">Nehemiah 9:7</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/9-15.htm" title="And gave them bread from heaven for their hunger, and brought forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst, and promised them that they should go in to possess the land which you had sworn to give them.">Nehemiah 9:15</a>): it denotes ‘deliverance’, ‘dismissal’, ‘removal’, ‘utterance’: but is not at all suited to the description of the mission. It occurs very often in the O.T., but it may be questioned whether it is ever elsewhere rendered “send forth”.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">unto Iddo the chief at the place Casiphia</span>] Lit. ‘Iddo the head’. Iddo clearly exercised some position of authority over the Jews, and particularly over the Levites and Nethinim settled at Casiphia. We may conjecture that Iddo was a Levite presiding over a college of young Levites and Nethinim, and who might be ready to send young men to Ezra’s aid.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Casiphia</span>] which some of the older commentators used to identify with the ‘Caspian’, was probably some village in the neighbourhood of Babylon. The LXX. rendered the word from the similarity of the first part of the word to the Hebrew ‘ceseph’ (silver), <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἀργυρίῳ τοῦ τόπου</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and I told them what they should say</span>] Lit. ‘And I put words in their mouth to speak’. The general charge comprised verbatim instructions. On the phrase “put words … in mouth”, cf. <a href="/exodus/4-15.htm" title="And you shall speak to him, and put words in his mouth: and I will be with your mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what you shall do.">Exodus 4:15</a>; <a href="/numbers/23-16.htm" title="And the LORD met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said, Go again to Balak, and say thus.">Numbers 23:16</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/31-19.htm" title="Now therefore write you this song for you, and teach it the children of Israel: put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel.">Deuteronomy 31:19</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">unto Iddo</span>, and to <span class="ital">his brethren the Nethinims</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">unto Iddo</span> <span class="ital">and</span> <span class="bld">his brethren the Nethinim.</span> Marg. ‘The text as pointed has, <span class="ital">Iddo, his brother</span>.’ The text is here corrupt. The uncertainty as to Iddo’s position, and the unlikelihood that a man of such influence would have been one of the Nethinim, has increased the doubtfulness of the true reading, (<span class="ital">a</span>) Adopting the pointed text, and supposing the letter Vaw (=and) to be accidentally dropped after the name of Iddo which ends with that letter, we could render ‘unto Iddo <span class="ital">and his brother</span>, the Nethinim’. (<span class="ital">b</span>) Altering the vowel-points and assuming the omission of the same letter, we obtain the rendering of the A.V. and R.V. “unto Iddo <span class="ital">and his brethren</span> the Nethinim” (cf. <a href="/ezra/3-2.htm" title="Then stood up Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brothers the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and his brothers, and built the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt offerings thereon, as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God.">Ezra 3:2</a>, Jeshua and his brethren the priests). (<span class="ital">c</span>) Supposing a second similar omission to have taken place, we have “unto Iddo and his brethren (i.e. Levites) and the Nethinim”.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Of these alternative renderings (<span class="ital">c</span>) appears to be the most probable. The appeal is made to Iddo and to his brethren the Levites. As the response (18–20) comes from Levites and Nethinim, we conclude that Iddo presided over the Nethinim as well as over the Levites. Just as a High-priest himself a priest, would preside over priests and Levites, so Iddo himself a Levite would preside over Levites and Nethinim. The Nethinim may have been more numerous and influential than the Levites. At any rate it is not likely that Iddo himself belonged to this inferior class.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">ministers</span>] A very general word in the original, to include Levites and Nethinim. Cf. <a href="/1_samuel/2-11.htm" title="And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child did minister to the LORD before Eli the priest.">1 Samuel 2:11</a>. The LXX., misreading a letter, renders “singers” (<span class="greekheb">ᾄδοντας</span>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezra/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Iddo</span>, <span class="cmt_word">the chief at the place Casiphia.</span> Not "the Caspian" certainly; nor even "Casvin," which is at least 400 miles from Hit by the nearest route, but some Babylonian village in the vicinity of Ahava, not otherwise known to us. <span class="cmt_word">Unto Iddo, and to his brethren the Nethinims.</span> The "and" here is rightly supplied.

It is true that we have in the lxx &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c5;&#x3b9;&#788;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c5;&#x3b9;&#788;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3a6;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;; but in this case the &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; is certainly derived from the translator, who was thus seeking to make sense of the words. In 1 Esdr. 8 we read &#x394;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3a3;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;; and &#x394;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; corresponding with &#1495;&#1496;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;, the words &#1489;&#1504;&#1497; &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492; (or &#1489;&#1503;) are taken into the preceding verse. This treatment of the words Bertheau considers correct, because Hattush in <a href="/1_chronicles/3-22.htm">1 Chronicles 3:22</a> is reckoned among the descendants of Shecaniah. This conjecture is, however, a very doubtful one. For, first, in <a href="/1_chronicles/3-22.htm">1 Chronicles 3:22</a> Hattush is said to be of the sons of Shemaiah, and Shemaiah of the sons of Shecaniah; then we should as little expect any further statement in the case of Hattush as in the cases of Daniel and Gershom; and further, if he had been thus more precisely designated by naming his father, we should undoubtedly read &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468;&#1503;, not &#1513;&#1473; &#1502;&#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;, and thus the Masoretic text would at any rate be incorrect; and finally, 1 Esdras, where it differs from the lxx, is, generally speaking, no critical authority upon which to base safe conclusions. Under these circumstances, we must give up the hope of restoring the original text, and explaining the words &#1502;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497; &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492;. &#1492;&#1514;&#1497;&#1495;&#1513;&#1474; &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;, "and with Zechariah, his genealogy of 150 males," i.e., with him his race, consisting of 150 males, registered in the genealogy of the race. In the case of the names which follow, the number only is given after the briefer expression &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;.<p>A review, then, of the twelve races, according to the restoration of the original text in <a href="/ezra/8-5.htm">Ezra 8:5</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/8-10.htm">Ezra 8:10</a>, presents us with names already occurring in the list of the races who came from Babylon with Zerubbabel, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/2-3.htm">Ezra 2:3-15</a>, with the exception of the sons of Joab, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/8-9.htm">Ezra 8:9</a>, who are wanting in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/2.htm">Ezra 2</a>, where, on the other hand, several other races are enumerated. Bertheau seeks to identify the sons of Joab, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/8-9.htm">Ezra 8:9</a>, with the sons of Joab who in <a href="/ezra/2-6.htm">Ezra 2:6</a> are reckoned with the sons of Pahath-Moab, and to explain their special enumeration in the present list, by the conjecture that the one house subsequently separated into the two houses of Pahath-Moab and Joab, This is, indeed, possible; but it is quite a probable that only one portion or branch of the sons (descendants) of Joab was combined with the race of the sons of Pahath-Moab, and that the rest of the bne Joab formed a separate house, no family of which returned with Zerubbabel. The occurrence of the other races in both lists is to be explained by the circumstance that portions of them returned with Zerubbabel, and that the rest did not follow till Ezra's departure.</body></html>
