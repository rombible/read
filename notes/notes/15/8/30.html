This expression goes to prove that the body of men to whom Ezra entrusted the precious things consisted of two groups of twelve, the one priests the other Levites (see on <a href="/ezra/8-24.htm" title="Then I separated twelve of the chief of the priests, Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brothers with them,">Ezra 8:24</a>).<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ezra/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Then Ezra delivered the gold, the silver, and the vessels, which he had received as gifts for the temple, to twelve of the chiefs of the priests, and twelve Levites, that they might take charge of them during the journey, and bring them to Jerusalem. "I separated twelve of the chief of the priests," i.e., from the whole company of priests who were journeying with us. The following &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1489;&#1497;&#1492; does not suit the sense, whether we take the &#1500; as a sign of the dative (lxx) or of the accusative (Vulgate, and several expositors). For Sherebiah and Hashabiah were neither priests nor chiefs of priests, but Levites of the race of Merari (v. 18), and cannot therefore be reckoned among the twelve chiefs of priests. If we take &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1489;&#1497;&#1492; for a dative, and translate, "I separated twelve of the chiefs of the priests for Sherebiah and Hashabiah," this would place the priests in a servile relation to the Levites, contrary to their true position. For &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1489;&#1497;&#1492; we must read &#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1489;&#1497;&#1492;, and accept the reading of 1 Esdras, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x395;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;, as correct. Ezra separated twelve chiefs of the priests and twelve Levites, for the purpose of delivering to their custody the gifts of gold, silver, and implements for the temple. Of the chiefs of the priests no names are mentioned; of the Levites, the two names Sherebiah and Hashabiah are given as those of heads of houses, with whom ten other Levites were associated.</body></html>
