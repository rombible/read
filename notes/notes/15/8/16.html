Of these two renderings the first seems to give the better sense. It hardly seems suited to the context to mention that Ezra, who commanded the whole assembly, summoned to his presence certain leading men before sending them upon an important mission. On the other hand it was quite in keeping with Ezra’s position to despatch such men upon his errand at once; and while the first verse (<a href="/ezra/8-16.htm" title="Then sent I for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for Elnathan, and for Jarib, and for Elnathan, and for Nathan, and for Zechariah, and for Meshullam, chief men; also for Joiarib, and for Elnathan, men of understanding.">Ezra 8:16</a>) records the fact of the message and the names of the leading men, whom he sends, the second verse (<a href="/ezra/8-17.htm" title="And I sent them with commandment to Iddo the chief at the place Casiphia, and I told them what they should say to Iddo, and to his brothers the Nethinims, at the place Casiphia, that they should bring to us ministers for the house of our God.">Ezra 8:17</a>) describes the object and purpose of the mission. The peculiar usage of the preposition is quite in character with the style of the Hebrew in the books. The probability that this is the correct rendering is increased by the variation in the reading of <a href="/ezra/8-17.htm" title="And I sent them with commandment to Iddo the chief at the place Casiphia, and I told them what they should say to Iddo, and to his brothers the Nethinims, at the place Casiphia, that they should bring to us ministers for the house of our God.">Ezra 8:17</a> (see note).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">chief</span> men] Literally ‘heads’: not ‘the heads’ referred to in <a href="/ezra/8-1.htm" title="These are now the chief of their fathers, and this is the genealogy of them that went up with me from Babylon, in the reign of Artaxerxes the king.">Ezra 8:1</a>, but certain leaders.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>men <span class="ital">of understanding</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">which were teachers.</span> Marg. <span class="ital">which had understanding</span>.

For, first, there is no other instance in the whole list of the sons of two men being cited before the proper name of the house; and then, too, the absence of the &#1493; copulative before &#1502;&#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1508; is opposed to the notion that the house of Zechariah was formed by a union of the sons of Shecaniah and Parosh, since in this case the and could not be omitted. It is true that we have in the lxx &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c5;&#x3b9;&#788;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c5;&#x3b9;&#788;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3a6;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;; but in this case the &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; is certainly derived from the translator, who was thus seeking to make sense of the words. In 1 Esdr. 8 we read &#x394;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3a3;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;; and &#x394;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; corresponding with &#1495;&#1496;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;, the words &#1489;&#1504;&#1497; &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492; (or &#1489;&#1503;) are taken into the preceding verse. This treatment of the words Bertheau considers correct, because Hattush in <a href="/1_chronicles/3-22.htm">1 Chronicles 3:22</a> is reckoned among the descendants of Shecaniah. This conjecture is, however, a very doubtful one. For, first, in <a href="/1_chronicles/3-22.htm">1 Chronicles 3:22</a> Hattush is said to be of the sons of Shemaiah, and Shemaiah of the sons of Shecaniah; then we should as little expect any further statement in the case of Hattush as in the cases of Daniel and Gershom; and further, if he had been thus more precisely designated by naming his father, we should undoubtedly read &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468;&#1503;, not &#1513;&#1473; &#1502;&#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;, and thus the Masoretic text would at any rate be incorrect; and finally, 1 Esdras, where it differs from the lxx, is, generally speaking, no critical authority upon which to base safe conclusions. Under these circumstances, we must give up the hope of restoring the original text, and explaining the words &#1502;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497; &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492;. &#1492;&#1514;&#1497;&#1495;&#1513;&#1474; &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;, "and with Zechariah, his genealogy of 150 males," i.e., with him his race, consisting of 150 males, registered in the genealogy of the race. In the case of the names which follow, the number only is given after the briefer expression &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;.<p>A review, then, of the twelve races, according to the restoration of the original text in <a href="/ezra/8-5.htm">Ezra 8:5</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/8-10.htm">Ezra 8:10</a>, presents us with names already occurring in the list of the races who came from Babylon with Zerubbabel, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/2-3.htm">Ezra 2:3-15</a>, with the exception of the sons of Joab, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/8-9.htm">Ezra 8:9</a>, who are wanting in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/2.htm">Ezra 2</a>, where, on the other hand, several other races are enumerated. Bertheau seeks to identify the sons of Joab, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/8-9.htm">Ezra 8:9</a>, with the sons of Joab who in <a href="/ezra/2-6.htm">Ezra 2:6</a> are reckoned with the sons of Pahath-Moab, and to explain their special enumeration in the present list, by the conjecture that the one house subsequently separated into the two houses of Pahath-Moab and Joab, This is, indeed, possible; but it is quite a probable that only one portion or branch of the sons (descendants) of Joab was combined with the race of the sons of Pahath-Moab, and that the rest of the bne Joab formed a separate house, no family of which returned with Zerubbabel. The occurrence of the other races in both lists is to be explained by the circumstance that portions of them returned with Zerubbabel, and that the rest did not follow till Ezra's departure.</body></html>
