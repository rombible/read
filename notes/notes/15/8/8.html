Of priests, Gershom of the sons of Phinehas, and Daniel of the sons of Ithamar. Gershom and Daniel are the names of heads of priestly houses, and "sons of Phinehas and sons of Ithamar" designations of races. Phinehas was the son of the high priest Eleazar, the son of Aaron, and Ithamar a younger son of Aaron, <a href="/1_chronicles/6-4.htm">1 Chronicles 6:4</a> and <a href="/1_chronicles/6-3.htm">1 Chronicles 6:3</a>. This does not signify that only the two priests Gershom and Daniel went up with Ezra; for in <a href="/ezra/8-24.htm">Ezra 8:24</a> he chose twelve from among the chief of the priests, who went up with him, to have charge of the gifts (Bertheau). The meaning is, that Gershom and Daniel, two heads of priestly houses, went up, and that the house of Gershom belonged to the race of Phinehas, and that of Daniel to the race of Ithamar. A Daniel is named among the priests in <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/10-7.htm">Nehemiah 10:7</a>, but whether he is identical with the Daniel in question does not appear. Of the sons (descendants) of David (the king), Hattush, as head of a house. A Hattush, son of Hashabniah, occurs <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-10.htm">Nehemiah 3:10</a>, and a priest of this name <a href="/nehemiah/10-5.htm">Nehemiah 10:5</a> and <a href="/nehemiah/12-2.htm">Nehemiah 12:2</a>. Hattush also holds the first place among the sons of Shemaiah enumerated <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-22.htm">1 Chronicles 3:22</a>, who probably were among the descendants of David. It seems strange that the numbers neither of the priests nor of the sons of David who went up with Ezra should be given, since from v. 3 onwards, in the case of the houses of lay races, the numbers of those who returned to the home of their ancestors is regularly stated.</body></html>
