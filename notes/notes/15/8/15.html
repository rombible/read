By comparing of these places, it seems that Ahava was the name both of the river and of the town or place by which it ran. Either this was that river of Assyria, which other writers call Adiava, or Diava, which ran along the Adiabene, upon which Ptolemy places the city of Abane, or Aavane; or some other river which ran into the Euphrates. Here, some imagine, was the country which (<a href="/2_kings/17-24.htm" title="And the king of Assyria brought men from Babylon, and from Cuthah, and from Ava, and from Hamath, and from Sepharvaim, and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel: and they possessed Samaria, and dwelled in the cities thereof.">2 Kings 17:24</a>) is called <span class="ital">Ava, </span>from whence the king of Assyria translated the people called Avites into Palestine, and in their room settled some of the captive Israelites. It was a common thing for those who travelled from Babylon to Jerusalem, in order to avoid the scorching heat of the desert of Arabia, to shape their course northward at first, and then turning westward, to pass through Syria into Palestine. But Ezra had a further reason for his taking this route; for, as he intended to get together as many Israelites as he could, to carry along with him to Jerusalem, he took his course this way, and made a halt in the country of Ava, or Ahava, from whence he might send emissaries, to a place afterward mentioned, to invite such Jews as were there to come and join him.

But it was certainly in Babylonia on the banks of that stream; and perhaps the place appointed for general rendezvous was in the neighborhood of a town of the same name.

The Rendezvous<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">15</span>. <span class="ital">the river that runneth to Ahava</span>] ‘Ahava’ is here the name of a place, which seems to have also given its name to the river. Ewald conjectured that the river Ahava (or Peleg-Ahava) was to be identified with the Palacopas, which flowed S. of Babylon. Rawlinson identifies with the river Is mentioned by Herodotus (i. 179) flowing from the E. into the Euphrates at a point, where stood a town of the same name (the modern Hit), an eight days’ journey distant from Babylon. He points out that a well-known town upon the line of march would be a likely spot for a halting-place.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>We do not however gather from the verse that Ezra’s march had actually begun. The rendezvous at Ahava enabled Ezra to make the necessary preliminary review of his large company. It is hardly likely that this first review would be held at a great distance from Babylon, where the great majority of the Jews were settled. On the other hand it is equally unlikely that a gathering of 1500 men and of a caravan which must have comprised 7000 or 8000 souls would have met within the walls of Babylon.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The conjecture therefore that the Ahava was one of the many canals or artificial rivers in the vicinity of Babylon, appears to be the most probable. Perhaps there was a specially influential settlement of Jews on the banks of the Ahava, as there had been once on the banks of the Chebar (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/1-1.htm" title="Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I was among the captives by the river of Chebar, that the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.">Ezekiel 1:1</a> &c.). For purposes of lustration the pious Jews may have met with special frequency by the banks of rivers (cf. the proseuchæ and synagogues of later times), “By the rivers of Babylon,” (<a href="/psalms/137-1.htm" title="By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yes, we wept, when we remembered Zion.">Psalm 137:1</a>). See <a href="/acts/16-13.htm" title="And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side, where prayer was wont to be made; and we sat down, and spoke to the women which resorted thither.">Acts 16:13</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//apocrypha.org/1_esdras/8-41.htm" title="And these I gathered together to the river called Theras, where we pitched our tents three days: and then I surveyed them.">1Es 8:41</a> renders by ‘a river called Theras’ (<span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ τὸν λεγόμενον Θερὰν πόταμον</span>).

The three days’ encampment preceded the final move. The short interval was employed by Ezra in securing the services of Levites. As the camp was struck and the march begun on the 12th day (see <a href="/ezra/8-31.htm" title="Then we departed from the river of Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month, to go to Jerusalem: and the hand of our God was on us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy, and of such as lay in wait by the way.">Ezra 8:31</a>), the encampment lasted from the 9th to the 12th. Ezra’s preparations were begun on the 1st day (see <a href="/ezra/7-9.htm" title="For on the first day of the first month began he to go up from Babylon, and on the first day of the fifth month came he to Jerusalem, according to the good hand of his God on him.">Ezra 7:9</a> and note).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">I viewed</span>] i.e. gave attention to. The same word occurs in <a href="/nehemiah/13-7.htm" title="And I came to Jerusalem, and understood of the evil that Eliashib did for Tobiah, in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of God.">Nehemiah 13:7</a>, “I came to Jerusalem and <span class="ital">understood of</span> the evil.” Cf. <a href="/proverbs/7-7.htm" title="And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding,">Proverbs 7:7</a>, “I <span class="ital">discerned</span> among the youths”. <a href="/job/42-3.htm" title="Who is he that hides counsel without knowledge? therefore have I uttered that I understood not; things too wonderful for me, which I knew not.">Job 42:3</a>; <a href="/daniel/12-8.htm" title="And I heard, but I understood not: then said I, O my Lord, what shall be the end of these things?">Daniel 12:8</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the people, and the priests</span>] i.e. the laity (cf. <a href="/ezra/2-2.htm" title="Which came with Zerubbabel: Jeshua, Nehemiah, Seraiah, Reelaiah, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mizpar, Bigvai, Rehum, Baanah. The number of the men of the people of Israel:">Ezra 2:2</a>), and the priests.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and found there none of the sons of Levi</span>] On the occasion of Zerubbabel’s journey from Babylon, only seventy-four Levites accompanied him, although over four thousand priests returned (cf. <a href="/ezra/2-36.htm" title="The priests: the children of Jedaiah, of the house of Jeshua, nine hundred seventy and three.">Ezra 2:36</a>, &c.). The backwardness of the Levites to join in the return to the Temple-worship is probably to be explained by their having been especially concerned in (<span class="ital">a</span>) the worship at the high places, (<span class="ital">b</span>) the idolatrous forms of worship, which the reformation of Josiah had sought to abolish.

The "river that runneth to Ahava" is now generally identified with the Is of Herodotus (1:179), a small stream flowing into the Euphrates from the east, at a point where stood a city of the same name, distant (according to Herodotus) <span class="accented">eight</span> days' journey from Babylon. The city appears to be mentioned under the slightly variant forms of Ava (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span>) and Ivah (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>) in the Second Book of Kings (2 Kings 17:24; 19:13). It is called Aia, or Aba, by the LXX.; Ihi in the Talmud; Aei by Isidore of Charax. The modern name is Hit. The town has always been one of some importance in connection with the bitumen springs of the neighbourhood. Ezra s reason for selecting the place as a halting-point seems to have been the fact that many Jews were settled in the district (see ver. 17). <span class="cmt_word">We abode in tents</span>. A large caravan, like Ezra's, even when it reached a town, would pitch its tents outside, and remain in them rather than scatter itself among the khans and caravanserais. The phrase is therefore to be understood literally. <span class="cmt_word">I viewed</span> <span class="cmt_word">the people.</span> Rather, "I looked among the people" - I looked to see whether there were any Levites or no.

It is difficult to account for the fact; but there seems certainly to have been a special disinclination to return to Jerusalem on the part of the Levites. Only seventy-four went up with Zerubbabel, when the priests who returned were 4289 (<a href="/ezra/2-36.htm">Ezra 2:36-40</a>); and now there was not a single one in the whole of Ezra's band.

Hence the text of <a href="/ezra/8-5.htm">Ezra 8:5</a> needs emendation, and should run &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492; &#1494;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; &#1502;&#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;, and that of <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/8-10.htm">Ezra 8:10</a>, &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1502;&#1497;&#1514; &#1489;&#1504;&#1497; &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;. It is more difficult to decide concerning &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492; &#1502;&#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; of <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/8-3.htm">Ezra 8:3</a>, though undoubtedly we have here too a corruption of the text. For, first, there is no other instance in the whole list of the sons of two men being cited before the proper name of the house; and then, too, the absence of the &#1493; copulative before &#1502;&#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1508; is opposed to the notion that the house of Zechariah was formed by a union of the sons of Shecaniah and Parosh, since in this case the and could not be omitted. It is true that we have in the lxx &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c5;&#x3b9;&#788;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c5;&#x3b9;&#788;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3a6;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;; but in this case the &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; is certainly derived from the translator, who was thus seeking to make sense of the words. In 1 Esdr. 8 we read &#x394;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3a3;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;; and &#x394;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; corresponding with &#1495;&#1496;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;, the words &#1489;&#1504;&#1497; &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492; (or &#1489;&#1503;) are taken into the preceding verse. This treatment of the words Bertheau considers correct, because Hattush in <a href="/1_chronicles/3-22.htm">1 Chronicles 3:22</a> is reckoned among the descendants of Shecaniah. This conjecture is, however, a very doubtful one. For, first, in <a href="/1_chronicles/3-22.htm">1 Chronicles 3:22</a> Hattush is said to be of the sons of Shemaiah, and Shemaiah of the sons of Shecaniah; then we should as little expect any further statement in the case of Hattush as in the cases of Daniel and Gershom; and further, if he had been thus more precisely designated by naming his father, we should undoubtedly read &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468;&#1503;, not &#1513;&#1473; &#1502;&#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;, and thus the Masoretic text would at any rate be incorrect; and finally, 1 Esdras, where it differs from the lxx, is, generally speaking, no critical authority upon which to base safe conclusions. Under these circumstances, we must give up the hope of restoring the original text, and explaining the words &#1502;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497; &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492;. &#1492;&#1514;&#1497;&#1495;&#1513;&#1474; &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;, "and with Zechariah, his genealogy of 150 males," i.e., with him his race, consisting of 150 males, registered in the genealogy of the race. In the case of the names which follow, the number only is given after the briefer expression &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;.<p>A review, then, of the twelve races, according to the restoration of the original text in <a href="/ezra/8-5.htm">Ezra 8:5</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/8-10.htm">Ezra 8:10</a>, presents us with names already occurring in the list of the races who came from Babylon with Zerubbabel, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/2-3.htm">Ezra 2:3-15</a>, with the exception of the sons of Joab, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/8-9.htm">Ezra 8:9</a>, who are wanting in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/2.htm">Ezra 2</a>, where, on the other hand, several other races are enumerated. Bertheau seeks to identify the sons of Joab, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/8-9.htm">Ezra 8:9</a>, with the sons of Joab who in <a href="/ezra/2-6.htm">Ezra 2:6</a> are reckoned with the sons of Pahath-Moab, and to explain their special enumeration in the present list, by the conjecture that the one house subsequently separated into the two houses of Pahath-Moab and Joab, This is, indeed, possible; but it is quite a probable that only one portion or branch of the sons (descendants) of Joab was combined with the race of the sons of Pahath-Moab, and that the rest of the bne Joab formed a separate house, no family of which returned with Zerubbabel. The occurrence of the other races in both lists is to be explained by the circumstance that portions of them returned with Zerubbabel, and that the rest did not follow till Ezra's departure.</body></html>
