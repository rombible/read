Even the common perils of journeys, call us to go out with prayer, and to return with praise and thanksgiving. But what shall we render when the Lord has led us safely through the pilgrimage of life, through the gloomy vale of death, out of the reach of all our enemies, into everlasting happiness! Among their sacrifices they had a sin-offering. The atonement sweetens and secures every mercy to us, which will not be truly comfortable, unless sin be taken away, and our peace made with God. Then had the church rest. The expressions here used, direct us to the deliverance of sinners from spiritual bondage, and their pilgrimage to the heavenly Jerusalem, under the care and protection of their God and Saviour.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ezra/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Jews with Ezra left Babylon on the first day of the first month <a href="/ezra/7-9.htm">Ezra 7:9</a>.
