Ezra's address is a penitent confession of sin, the sin of his people. But let this be the comfort of true penitents, that though their sins reach to the heavens, God's mercy is in the heavens. Ezra, speaking of sin, speaks as one much ashamed. Holy shame is as necessary in true repentance as holy sorrow. Ezra speaks as much amazed. The discoveries of guilt cause amazement; the more we think of sin, the worse it looks. Say, God be merciful to me sinner. Ezra speaks as one much afraid. There is not a surer or saddler presage of ruin, than turning to sin, after great judgments, and great deliverances. Every one in the church of God, has to wonder that he has not wearied out the Lord's patience, and brought destruction upon himself. What then must be the case of the ungodly? But though the true penitent has nothing to plead in his own behalf, the heavenly Advocate pleads most powerfully for him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ezra/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>We were bondmen - Rather, "we are bondmen" (compare the marginal reference).

God had begun to show returning favor to Israel by the restoration of some. But this only aggravated their sin, that, so soon after their re-establishment in their native land, they openly violated the express and repeated precepts which commanded them to extirpate the Canaanites. Such conduct, he exclaimed, could issue only in drawing down some great punishment from offended Heaven and ensuring the destruction of the small remnant of us that is left, unless, by the help of divine grace, we repent and bring forth the fruits of repentance in an immediate and thorough reformation.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ezra/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> What apology can we make for ourselves, after thou hast conferred such great and high favours upon us, and we have so grossly abused them? <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/ezra/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And now, O our God, what shall we say after this?....
