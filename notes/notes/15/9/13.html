Ezra's address is a penitent confession of sin, the sin of his people. But let this be the comfort of true penitents, that though their sins reach to the heavens, God's mercy is in the heavens. Ezra, speaking of sin, speaks as one much ashamed. Holy shame is as necessary in true repentance as holy sorrow. Ezra speaks as much amazed. The discoveries of guilt cause amazement; the more we think of sin, the worse it looks. Say, God be merciful to me sinner. Ezra speaks as one much afraid. There is not a surer or saddler presage of ruin, than turning to sin, after great judgments, and great deliverances. Every one in the church of God, has to wonder that he has not wearied out the Lord's patience, and brought destruction upon himself. What then must be the case of the ungodly? But though the true penitent has nothing to plead in his own behalf, the heavenly Advocate pleads most powerfully for him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ezra/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Deliverance - Or, "remnant," as in <a href="/ezra/9-8.htm">Ezra 9:8</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ezra/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Ezr 9:5-15.

I fell upon my knees, and spread out my hands unto the Lord my God&#8212;The burden of his prayer, which was dictated by a deep sense of the emergency, was that he was overwhelmed at the flagrant enormity of this sin, and the bold impiety of continuing in it after having, as a people, so recently experienced the heavy marks of the divine displeasure. God had begun to show returning favor to Israel by the restoration of some. But this only aggravated their sin, that, so soon after their re-establishment in their native land, they openly violated the express and repeated precepts which commanded them to extirpate the Canaanites. Such conduct, he exclaimed, could issue only in drawing down some great punishment from offended Heaven and ensuring the destruction of the small remnant of us that is left, unless, by the help of divine grace, we repent and bring forth the fruits of repentance in an immediate and thorough reformation.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ezra/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> After all our sore sufferings for our sins, and after all thy favour showed to us in the mitigation of thy judgments. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Such deliverance as this; </span> so full, so sudden, and unexpected, and amazing, not only to our enemies, but also to ourselves. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/ezra/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds, and for our great trespass,....

Literally, ‘hast kept back, downward, from our sins’. Some have rendered ‘hast as it were held back, and kept down from rising to view, many of (partitive) our sins’. Others, ‘hast spared beneath our sins’, i.e. thy mercy has been out of all proportion greater than our sins, has as it were gone deeper than our iniquities. The R.V. gives the general sense.
