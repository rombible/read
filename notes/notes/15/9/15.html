Ezra's address is a penitent confession of sin, the sin of his people. But let this be the comfort of true penitents, that though their sins reach to the heavens, God's mercy is in the heavens. Ezra, speaking of sin, speaks as one much ashamed. Holy shame is as necessary in true repentance as holy sorrow. Ezra speaks as much amazed. The discoveries of guilt cause amazement; the more we think of sin, the worse it looks. Say, God be merciful to me sinner. Ezra speaks as one much afraid. There is not a surer or saddler presage of ruin, than turning to sin, after great judgments, and great deliverances. Every one in the church of God, has to wonder that he has not wearied out the Lord's patience, and brought destruction upon himself. What then must be the case of the ungodly? But though the true penitent has nothing to plead in his own behalf, the heavenly Advocate pleads most powerfully for him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ezra/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Some take "righteous" to mean here "kind" or "merciful."

I fell upon my knees, and spread out my hands unto the Lord my God&#8212;The burden of his prayer, which was dictated by a deep sense of the emergency, was that he was overwhelmed at the flagrant enormity of this sin, and the bold impiety of continuing in it after having, as a people, so recently experienced the heavy marks of the divine displeasure. God had begun to show returning favor to Israel by the restoration of some. But this only aggravated their sin, that, so soon after their re-establishment in their native land, they openly violated the express and repeated precepts which commanded them to extirpate the Canaanites. Such conduct, he exclaimed, could issue only in drawing down some great punishment from offended Heaven and ensuring the destruction of the small remnant of us that is left, unless, by the help of divine grace, we repent and bring forth the fruits of repentance in an immediate and thorough reformation.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ezra/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Thou art righteous; </span> a just and holy God, who dost hate, and wilt infallibly punish, sin and sinners.

The thought of his nation overmastered the supplicant.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">thou</span> art <span class="ital">righteous</span>] This must not be softened down as if it were ‘thou art gracious’. The words are an acknowledgement of the perfect justice of God’s dealings with Israel in the past. The next sentence ‘for we are left a remnant’ is not uttered in gratitude for the mercy which spared ‘a remnant’, but is added to express the greatness of the catastrophe, which had carried off the whole nation except ‘a remnant’. And yet the visitation had been just. The prayer of Ezra (?) in Nehemiah 9 has a very similar phrase, <a href="/nehemiah/9-33.htm" title="However, you are just in all that is brought on us; for you have done right, but we have done wickedly:">Nehemiah 9:33</a> ‘Howbeit thou art just (çaddîq) in all that is come upon us; for thou hast done truly, but we have done wickedly’. Thou art righteous (çaddîq), and we who are left ‘a remnant’ have failed to profit by the righteous judgement of the past. God is called ‘righteous’ in reference to the ‘fixed and unalterable rule of truth and goodness’. Cf. <a href="/nehemiah/9-8.htm" title="And found his heart faithful before you, and made a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Jebusites, and the Girgashites, to give it, I say, to his seed, and have performed your words; for you are righteous:">Nehemiah 9:8</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/12-6.htm" title="Whereupon the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves; and they said, The LORD is righteous.">2 Chronicles 12:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/119-137.htm" title="Righteous are you, O LORD, and upright are your judgments.">Psalm 119:137</a>; <a href="/psalms/129-4.htm" title="The LORD is righteous: he has cut asunder the cords of the wicked.">Psalm 129:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/145-7.htm" title="They shall abundantly utter the memory of your great goodness, and shall sing of your righteousness.">Psalm 145:7</a>.

He calls the short interval between their release from captivity by Cyrus, and the time when he is speaking, &#1512;&#1490;&#1506; &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1506;&#1496;, a little moment (comp. <a href="/isaiah/26-20.htm">Isaiah 26:20</a>), in comparison with the long period of suffering from the times of the Assyrians (comp. <a href="/nehemiah/9-32.htm">Nehemiah 9:32</a>) till the reign of Cyrus. &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1496;&#1492;, a rescued remnant, is the new community delivered from Babylon, and returned to the land of their fathers. In proportion to the numerous population of former days, it was but a remnant that escaped destruction; but a remnant which, according to the predictions of the prophets, was again to grow into a large nation. A foundation for this hope was given by the fact that God had given them "a nail in the place of His sanctuary." The expression is figurative. &#1497;&#1514;&#1491; is a nail or peg struck into the wall, to hang any kind of domestic utensils upon; comp. <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/22-23.htm">Isaiah 22:23</a>, etc. Such a nail was the place of God's sanctuary, the temple, to the rescued community. This was to them a firm nail, by which they were borne and upheld; and this nail God had given them as a support to which they might cling, and gain new life and vigour. The infinitive clauses following, &#1500;&#1492;&#1488;&#1497;&#1512; and &#1500;&#1514;&#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, are dependent upon the preceding infinitives &#1500;&#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1497;&#1512; and &#1493;&#1500;&#1514;&#1514;, and state the purpose for which God has given a nail in His house to this remnant. That our God may enlighten our eyes, i.e., may bestow upon us new vitality; comp. <a href="/psalms/13-4.htm">Psalm 13:4</a>. Suffering and misfortune make the eyes dim, and their light is quenched in death: the enlightened or beaming eye is an image of vital power; comp. <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-27.htm">1 Samuel 14:27</a>, <a href="/1_samuel/14-29.htm">1 Samuel 14:29</a>. &#1502;&#1495;&#1497;&#1492; &#1500;&#1514;&#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; is not to be translated, ut daret nobis vivificationem, the suffix to &#1500;&#1514;&#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; being not dative, but accusative. The literal rendering is: that He may make us a slight reviving. &#1502;&#1495;&#1497;&#1492;, the means of supporting life, restoration to life; see on <a href="/2_chronicles/14-13.htm">2 Chronicles 14:13</a>. Ezra adds &#1502;&#1506;&#1496;; for the life to which the community had attained was but feeble, in comparison with a vigorous social life. Their deliverance from Babylon and return to the land of their fathers was, so to speak, a revival from death; compare the embodiment of this figure in Ezekiel's vision, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-1.htm">Ezekiel 37:1-14</a> : they were, however, still in a state of vassalage, and had not yet regained their independence. This thought is further carried out in <a href="/ezra/9-9.htm">Ezra 9:9</a> : "For we are bondmen, yet our God hath not forsaken us in our bondage, but hath extended mercy to us before the kings of Persia; so that they have given us a reviving to build up the house of our God, and to repair its ruins, and have given us a wall about us in Judah and Jerusalem." They who have returned to Jerusalem and Judah are still bondmen, for they are yet under the Persian yoke; but God has disposed the kings of Persia so to favour them as to give them a reviving, to enable them to rebuild the house of God. Cyrus and Darius had not merely permitted and commanded the building of the temple, but had also furnished them with considerable assistance towards the carrying out of this work; comp. <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/1-3.htm">Ezra 1:3</a>, etc. <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/6-7.htm">Ezra 6:7-9</a>. The suffix in &#1495;&#1512;&#1489;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493; alludes to &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;. The words of the last sentence are figurative. &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1512; means the wall of a vineyard, the wall or fence built for its protection (<a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/5-2.htm">Isaiah 5:2</a>, <a href="/isaiah/5-5.htm">Isaiah 5:5</a>). Hence the wall, or enclosure, is an image of protection from the incursions and attacks of enemies. Such a wall has been given them in Judah and Jerusalem by the kings of Persia. "The meaning is not that they possess a place defended by walls (perhaps, therefore, the temple) in Jerusalem and Judah, but that the Persian kings have given to the new community a safe dwelling-place (or the means of existence), because the power of the Persian empire secures to the returned Israelites continued and undisturbed possession of the city and the land." (Bertheau.)<p>After this statement concerning the divine favour, Ezra next sets himself to describe the conduct of his countrymen with respect to the mercy extended to them.</body></html>
