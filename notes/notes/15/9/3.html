Some of the people disobeyed the express command of God, which forbade all marriages with the heathen, De 7. Disbelief of God's all-sufficiency, is at the bottom of the sorry shifts we make to help ourselves. They exposed themselves and their children to the peril of idolatry, that had ruined their church and nation. Carnal professors may make light of such connexions, and try to explain away the exhortations to be separate; but those who are best acquainted with the word of God, will treat the subject in another manner. They must forebode the worst from such unions. The evils excused, and even pleaded for; by many professors, astonish and cause regret in the true believer.

The rending of the clothes is frequently mentioned in Scripture as a sign of grief: Ezra here is described as rending the under-garment or tunic (the ‘begedh’) and the long loose robe (the m‘îl) in which he was attired. Reuben rent his ‘clothes’ (plur. of ‘begedh’) on not finding Joseph (<a href="/genesis/37-29.htm" title="And Reuben returned to the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not in the pit; and he rent his clothes.">Genesis 37:29</a>): Jacob rent his ‘garments’ (plur. of ‘simlah’) on seeing Joseph’s blood-stained coat (<a href="/genesis/37-34.htm" title="And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth on his loins, and mourned for his son many days.">Genesis 37:34</a>): Joseph’s brethren rent their clothers (plur. of ‘simlah’) when the cup was found in Benjamin’s sack (<a href="/genesis/44-13.htm" title="Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to the city.">Genesis 44:13</a>): Joshua rent his ‘clothes’ (plur. of ‘simlah’) after the repulse at Ai (<a href="/joshua/7-6.htm" title="And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth on his face before the ark of the LORD until the eventide, he and the elders of Israel, and put dust on their heads.">Joshua 7:6</a>): Jephthah rent his clothes (plur. of ‘begedh’) on meeting his daughter (<a href="/judges/11-35.htm" title="And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes, and said, Alas, my daughter! you have brought me very low, and you are one of them that trouble me: for I have opened my mouth to the LORD, and I cannot go back.">Jdg 11:35</a>): the messenger from the field of Ziklag came with his clothes (plur. of ‘begedh’) rent (<a href="/2_samuel/1-2.htm" title="It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth on his head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.">2 Samuel 1:2</a>, cf. <a href="/1_samuel/4-12.htm" title="And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same day with his clothes rent, and with earth on his head.">1 Samuel 4:12</a>): Job rent his mantle (‘m‘îl’) on hearing of his children’s death (<a href="/job/1-20.htm" title="Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down on the ground, and worshipped,">Job 1:20</a>), and his friends rent each one his mantle (‘m‘îl’) when they came to visit him (<a href="/job/2-12.htm" title="And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his mantle, and sprinkled dust on their heads toward heaven.">Job 2:12</a>). These were all signs of grief. The action also denoted ‘horror’ on receiving intelligence or hearing words, which shocked: thus Hezekiah and his ministers rent their clothes (plur. of ‘begedh’) after Rabshakeh’s speech (<a href="/2_kings/18-37.htm" title="Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, which was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told him the words of Rabshakeh.">2 Kings 18:37</a>; <a href="/2_kings/19-1.htm" title="And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the LORD.">2 Kings 19:1</a>): Mordecai rent his clothes (plur. of ‘begedh’) on hearing of Haman’s determination (<a href="/esther/4-1.htm" title="When Mordecai perceived all that was done, Mordecai rent his clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the middle of the city, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry;">Esther 4:1</a>): the High-priest rent his garments on hearing the testimony of Jesus (<a href="/matthew/26-65.htm" title="Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He has spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now you have heard his blasphemy.">Matthew 26:65</a>).

Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord, the dream be to them that hate you, and the interpretation thereof to your enemies.">Daniel 4:19</a> ‘Then Daniel … was astonied or a while’. The word in the original is the same as that rendered ‘desolator’ (marg. desolate) in <a href="/daniel/9-27.htm" title="And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in the middle of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate, even until the consummation, and that determined shall be poured on the desolate.">Daniel 9:27</a>, and ‘that maketh desolate’ <a href="/daniel/11-31.htm" title="And arms shall stand on his part, and they shall pollute the sanctuary of strength, and shall take away the daily sacrifice, and they shall place the abomination that makes desolate.">Daniel 11:31</a>.
