Nothing can be more false, for true godliness teaches us to honour and obey our sovereign. But where the command of God requires one thing and the law of the land another, we must obey God rather than man, and patiently submit to the consequences. All who love the gospel should avoid all appearance of evil, lest they should encourage the adversaries of the church. The world is ever ready to believe any accusation against the people of God, and refuses to listen to them. The king suffered himself to be imposed upon by these frauds and falsehoods. Princes see and hear with other men's eyes and ears, and judge things as represented to them, which are often done falsely.

The Pseudo-Smerdis, who was a fanatical adherent of Magism, which disallowed temples altogether (Herod., 1:130), and who had already destroyed the temples of Ormuzd in Persia ('Behistun Ins.,' col. 1. par. 14, 5), was naturally willing enough to do as the Samaritans desired, and stop the restoration of the Jewish temple. Accordingly, he had a search made among the state records, and found, as they had expected he would, evidence of insurrections on the part of the Jews against the foreign countries to which they had been subject, as Assyria (<a href="/2_kings/18-7.htm">2 Kings 18:7</a>) and Babylon (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> 24:1; <a href="/jeremiah/52-3.htm">Jeremiah 52:3</a>), and also proof of the formidable power possessed by certain Jewish or Israelite kings; upon which he thought himself justified in complying with the Samaritan request, and ordering the work that was going on at Jerusalem to cease (see ver. 21). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ezra/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Now be it known unto the king, that if this city be built up and ... they will not pay toll, tribute, and custom, and it (the city) will at last bring damage to the king."

The word &#1488;&#1508;&#1468;&#1492;&#1501;, which occurs only here, and has not been expressed by old translators, depends upon the Pehlevi word &#1488;&#1493;&#1491;&#1493;&#1501;: it is connected with the Sanscrit apa, in the superl. apama, and signifies at last, or in the future; comp. Haug, p. 156. &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1497;&#1501;, a Hebraized form for &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1497;&#1503;, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/4-15.htm">Ezra 4:15</a>, is perhaps only an error of transcription.</body></html>
