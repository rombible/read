Nothing can be more false, for true godliness teaches us to honour and obey our sovereign. But where the command of God requires one thing and the law of the land another, we must obey God rather than man, and patiently submit to the consequences. All who love the gospel should avoid all appearance of evil, lest they should encourage the adversaries of the church. The world is ever ready to believe any accusation against the people of God, and refuses to listen to them. The king suffered himself to be imposed upon by these frauds and falsehoods. Princes see and hear with other men's eyes and ears, and judge things as represented to them, which are often done falsely. But God's judgment is just; he sees things as they are.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ezra/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Hath been ... read - It is doubtful if the Persian monarchs could ordinarily read.
