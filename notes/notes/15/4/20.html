Nothing can be more false, for true godliness teaches us to honour and obey our sovereign. But where the command of God requires one thing and the law of the land another, we must obey God rather than man, and patiently submit to the consequences. All who love the gospel should avoid all appearance of evil, lest they should encourage the adversaries of the church. The world is ever ready to believe any accusation against the people of God, and refuses to listen to them. The king suffered himself to be imposed upon by these frauds and falsehoods. Princes see and hear with other men's eyes and ears, and judge things as represented to them, which are often done falsely. But God's judgment is just; he sees things as they are.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ezra/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Mighty kings ... - If this reference can scarcely have been to David or Solomon (see marginal reference), of whom neither the Babylonian nor the Assyrian archives would be likely to have had any account - it would probably be to Menahem <a href="/2_kings/15-16.htm">2 Kings 15:16</a> and Josiah (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-6.htm">2 Chronicles 34:6-7</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/35-18.htm">2 Chronicles 35:18</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ezra/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. we have maintenance from the king's palace&#8212;literally, "we are salted with the salt of the palace."

It is, however, needless to restrict the allusion of the present verse to those whose names appear in the Inscriptions or are involved in the ascertained history of Assyria and Babylon. Israelite traditions, oral or written, would probably have been accessible to those whom the king appointed to search into the past history of the race. The tradition of the golden age of David’s rule and Solomon’s empire would be rehearsed with pride by the captive Jew. The remoteness of the period mattered little. It was the boast of this people that their kings had once ruled over all the country W. of the Euphrates. This information coupled with the names of, perhaps, one or two of the other great kings, such as Omri, Jeroboam II., Menahem, Uzziah, Jotham and Josiah would be pretext enough for speaking of ‘the mighty kings’.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezra/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Mighty kings</span>.
