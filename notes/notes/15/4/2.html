Thus, the Samaritans speak of what had taken place at least 130 years previously. There appear to have been at least three colonizations of Samaria by the Assyrian kings. The first is mentioned in <a href="/2_kings/17-24.htm">2 Kings 17:24</a>. Later in his reign Sargon added to these first settlers an Arabian element. Some 30 or 40 years afterward, Esarhaddon, his grandson, largely augmented the population by colonists drawn especially from the southeast parts of the Empire <a href="/ezra/4-10.htm">Ezra 4:10</a>.

On a large cylinder, deposited in the British Museum, there is inscribed a long and perfect copy of the annals of Esar-haddon, in which the details are given of a large deportation of Israelites from Palestine, and a consequent settlement of Babylonian colonists in their place. It is a striking confirmation of the statement made in this passage. Those Assyrian settlers intermarried with the remnant of Israelite women, and their descendants, a mongrel race, went under the name of Samaritans. Though originally idolaters, they were instructed in the knowledge of God, so that they could say, "We seek your God"; but they served Him in a superstitious way of their own (see on [486]2Ki 17:26-34, 41).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ezra/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Let us build with you:</span> this they spake not sincerely, as appears from their disposition and designs discovered in the following history; but that by this conjunction with them they might pry into their counsels, and thereby get an opportunity to find some matter or pretences of accusation against them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">We seek your God, as ye do; </span> for so they did, though in a mongrel way: see <span class="bld"><a href="/2_kings/17-26.htm" title="Why they spoke to the king of Assyria, saying, The nations which you have removed, and placed in the cities of Samaria, know not the manner of the God of the land: therefore he has sent lions among them, and, behold, they slay them, because they know not the manner of the God of the land.">2 Kings 17:26</a></span>, &c. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Esar-haddon king of Assur; </span> son of Sennacherib, and after him king of Assyria, <span class="bld"><a href="/2_kings/19-37.htm" title="And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword: and they escaped into the land of Armenia.

These they addressed, as knowing that if they could not prevail with them, they could never succeed in their design; and these were no doubt the principal of the Samaritans that applied: <p>and said unto them, let us build with you; that is, the temple, they proposed to join with them, and assist them in it; which proposal at first sight might seem very agreeable and welcome, and would have been so had they been sincere, but they were not; they hoped, by getting among them, to have sown discord among them, and disunited them; and so by these or other means to have retarded the building; or if it went forward, that they might have a claim to it as theirs, at least as to set up their own idols in a part of it; the reasons they gave follow: <p>for we seek your God as ye do; which was false, for they did not worship him alone, but with idols, nor in the same manner as the Jews did: <p>and we do sacrifice unto him; but even that could not recommend them to the Jews, since they ought not to sacrifice, even to the Lord himself, but at Jerusalem: there is a various reading here; the textual reading is, "we do not sacrifice"; that is, to idols; the marginal reading is, "we sacrifice to him", which we follow; Aben Ezra takes in both, perhaps most rightly; "we do not sacrifice to any other, but to him"; which was also false: <p>since the days of Esarhaddon, king of Assur, who brought us up hither; to Samaria, from Babylon, and other places; see <a href="/2_kings/17-24.htm">2 Kings 17:24</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/ezra/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then they came to Zerubbabel, and to the chief of the fathers, and said unto them, Let us build with you: for we seek your God, as ye do; and we do sacrifice unto him since the days of Esarhaddon king of Assur, which brought us up hither.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/ezra/4.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2</span>. <span class="ital">then they came</span> &c.] R.V. <span class="bld">then they drew near to Zerubbabel, and to the heads of fathers’ houses.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">for we seek your God, as ye do</span>] The claim to cooperate in the work of building the Temple is based upon the assertion of common worship. The phrase ‘to seek’ in the sense of ‘to worship’ is not uncommon in these books and in Chronicles. Cf. <a href="/ezra/6-21.htm" title="And the children of Israel, which were come again out of captivity, and all such as had separated themselves to them from the filthiness of the heathen of the land, to seek the LORD God of Israel, did eat,">Ezra 6:21</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/22-19.htm" title="Now set your heart and your soul to seek the LORD your God; arise therefore, and build you the sanctuary of the LORD God, to bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and the holy vessels of God, into the house that is to be built to the name of the LORD.">1 Chronicles 22:19</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/15-13.htm" title="That whoever would not seek the LORD God of Israel should be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman.">2 Chronicles 15:13</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/17-4.htm" title="But sought to the Lord God of his father, and walked in his commandments, and not after the doings of Israel.">2 Chronicles 17:4</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/31-21.htm" title="And in every work that he began in the service of the house of God, and in the law, and in the commandments, to seek his God, he did it with all his heart, and prospered.">2 Chronicles 31:21</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/34-3.htm" title="For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he began to seek after the God of David his father: and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images.">2 Chronicles 34:3</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and we do sacrifice unto him</span>] so R.V. text. R.V. margin. ‘Another reading is, <span class="ital">yet we do no sacrifice since &c</span>.’ The Hebrew words for “unto him” and “not” though written with a different second letter are pronounced in the same way, ‘lô’. The context as a rule makes it easy to distinguish the meaning. But there are some <span class="ital">fifteen</span> instances, in which the Hebrew Bibles preserve the tradition of confusion between the two words. It is even possible that the word ‘lô’ (‘unto him’) may have sometimes been written with the same second letter as the negative (e.g. <a href="/exodus/21-8.htm" title="If she please not her master, who has betrothed her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her to a strange nation he shall have no power, seeing he has dealt deceitfully with her.">Exodus 21:8</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/2-3.htm" title="Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let not arrogance come out of your mouth: for the LORD is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed.">1 Samuel 2:3</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/16-18.htm" title="And Hushai said to Absalom, No; but whom the LORD, and this people, and all the men of Israel, choose, his will I be, and with him will I abide.">2 Samuel 16:18</a>; <a href="/2_kings/8-10.htm" title="And Elisha said to him, Go, say to him, You may certainly recover: however, the LORD has showed me that he shall surely die.">2 Kings 8:10</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In this verse the Hebrew text has the letters of the negative; the margin has the letters of the pronoun.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The <span class="ital">external</span> evidence is in favour of the pronoun ‘unto him’, being supported by the K’ri, by the LXX. (<span class="greekheb">αὐτῷ</span>), the Vulgate (‘nos immolabimus victimas’ without a negative), the Syriac, Versions and by the parallel text in <a href="//apocrypha.org/1_esdras/5-69.htm" title="For we likewise, as ye, do obey your Lord, and do sacrifice unto him from the days of Azbazareth the king of the Assyrians, who brought us hither.">1Es 5:69</a> (‘and do sacrifice unto him’).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Internal evidence may thus be summarized. In favour of <span class="ital">the negative</span> (‘yet we do no sacrifice’), it may be alleged<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(1) that the statement contained in the alternative reading ‘we do sacrifice unto him’ would have no weight, since the Jews would at once reject as idolatrous sacrifices not offered at Jerusalem:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(2) that the Samaritan argument requires the negative. Having pleaded sameness of worship, they regret the omission of sacrifice and proceed to entreat that they may obtain this privilege by becoming sharers in the work.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In favour of <span class="ital">the pronoun</span> (‘unto him’) it may be replied<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(1) that had the disputed word been the negative, it would stand in the Hebrew in the wrong place, i.e. before the pronoun ‘we’ instead of before the verb ‘sacrifice’:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(2) that the affirmative clause (‘and we do sacrifice unto him’) expands the force of the plea for common worship. That they had not sacrificed at Jerusalem hitherto, was, they could plead, either due to ignorance or a fault which they now wished to rectify:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(3) that the argument is strengthened by the assertion of long-established custom of sacrifice:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(4) that the pronoun ‘unto him’ was very liable to be altered to the negative by patriotic scribes who could not tolerate or credit the statement that their hated enemies had at such an early time done sacrifice to the God of Israel.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>We conclude that the balance of probability preponderates for the reading ‘and we do sacrifice unto him’.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">since the days of Esar-haddon king of Assur</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">Assyria.</span> Esarhaddon succeeded Sennacherib (cf. <a href="/2_kings/19-37.htm" title="And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword: and they escaped into the land of Armenia.

The difference in the spelling is purely arbitrary. The R.V. has altered ‘Assur’ to ‘Assyria’, but has left ‘Asshur’ in the above passages.

The singular &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1502;&#1491; stands before a plural subject, as is frequently the case when the verb precedes its subject. Three classes or orders of Levites are named: 1. Jeshua with his sons and brethren; 2. Kadmiel with his sons, the sons of Hodaviah; 3. The sons of Henadad, their sons and brethren. Jeshua and Kadmiel are the two heads of orders of Levites already named (<a href="/ezra/2-40.htm">Ezra 2:40</a>). From a comparison of these passages, we perceive that &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; is a clerical error for &#1492;&#1493;&#1491;&#1493;&#1497;&#1492; (or &#1492;&#1493;&#1491;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;) &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;.

The naming of this order after the predicate, in the form of a supplementary notice, and unconnected by a &#1493; cop., is striking. Bertheau infers therefrom that the construction of the sentence is incorrect, and desires to alter it according to 1 Esdr. 5:56, where indeed this class is named immediately after the two first, but &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; is separated from what precedes; and of these &#1489;&#1504;&#1497; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1491;&#1492; is made a fourth class, &#x3c5;&#x3b9;&#788;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x399;&#787;&#x3c9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#769; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x397;&#788;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b4;.

The striking position or supplementary enumeration of the sons of Henadad may be explained by the fact to which the placing of &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1495;&#1491; after &#1489;&#1504;&#1497; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1491;&#1492; points, viz., that the two classes, Jeshua with his sons and brethren, and Kadmiel with his sons, were more closely connected with each other than with the sons of Henadad, who formed a third class. The &#1492;&#1500;&#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1501; at the end of the enumeration offers no argument for the transposition of the words, though this addition pertains not only to the sons of Henadad, but also to the two first classes. hm' &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; is plural, and only an unusual reading for &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;; see on <a href="/1_chronicles/23-24.htm">1 Chronicles 23:24</a>.</body></html>
