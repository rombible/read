But where the command of God requires one thing and the law of the land another, we must obey God rather than man, and patiently submit to the consequences. All who love the gospel should avoid all appearance of evil, lest they should encourage the adversaries of the church. The world is ever ready to believe any accusation against the people of God, and refuses to listen to them. The king suffered himself to be imposed upon by these frauds and falsehoods. Princes see and hear with other men's eyes and ears, and judge things as represented to them, which are often done falsely.

The Samaritans suggest a consultation of this book, which would at any rate contain their own previous accusations against Jerusalem (<span class="accented">supra</span>, vers. 5, 6), and might make some mention of the revolts from Babylon (see the comment on ver. 12). <span class="cmt_word">For</span> <span class="cmt_word">which cause was this city destroyed.</span> This was the great fact on which the Samaritans relied.

The statement is rather a clumsy one, the construction especially exhibiting a want of sequence. The verb to &#1488;&#1491;&#1497;&#1503; is wanting; this follows in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/4-11.htm">Ezra 4:11</a>, but as an anacoluthon, after an enumeration of the names in <a href="/ezra/4-9.htm">Ezra 4:9</a> and <a href="/ezra/4-10.htm">Ezra 4:10</a> with &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;. The sentence ought properly to run thus: "Then (i.e., in the days of Artachshasta) Rehum, etc., sent a letter to King Artachshasta, of which the following is a copy: Thy servants, the men on this side the river," etc. The names enumerated in <a href="/ezra/4-9.htm">Ezra 4:9</a> and <a href="/ezra/4-10.htm">Ezra 4:10</a> were undoubtedly all inserted in the superscription or preamble of the letter, to give weight to the accusation brought against the Jews. The author of the Chaldee section of the narrative, however, has placed them first, and made the copy of the letter itself begin only with the words, "Thy servants," etc. First come the names of the superior officials, Rehum and Shimshai, and the rest of their companions. The latter are then separately enumerated: The Dinaites, lxx &#x394;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;, - so named, according to the conjecture of Ewald (Gesch. iii. p. 676), from the Median city long afterwards called Deinaver (Abulf. Gegr. ed. Paris. p. 414); the Apharsathchites, probably the Pharathiakites of Strabo (15:3. 12) (&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;, Herod. i. 101), on the borders of Persia and Media, described as being, together with the Elymaites, a predatory people relying on their mountain fastnesses; the Tarpelites, whom Junius already connects with the &#x3a4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; dwelling east of Elymais (Ptol. vi. 2. 6); the Apharsites, probably the Persians (&#1508;&#1512;&#1505;&#1497;&#1488; with &#1488; prosthetic); the Archevites, probably so called from the city &#1488;&#1512;&#1498;, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/10-10.htm">Genesis 10:10</a>, upon inscriptions Uruk, the modern Warka; the &#1489;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497;&#1488;, Babylonians, inhabitants of Babylon; the Shushanchites, i.e., the Susanites, inhabitants of the city of Susa; &#1491;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1488;, in the Keri &#1491;&#1468;&#1492;&#1497;&#1488;, the Dehavites, the Grecians (&#x394;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;, Herod. i. 125); and lastly, the Elamites, the people of Elam or Elymais. Full as this enumeration may seem, yet the motive being to name as many races as possible, the addition, "and the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Osnapper brought over and set in the city of Samaria, and the rest that are on this side the river," etc., is made for the sake of enhancing the statement. Prominence being given both here and <a href="/ezra/4-17.htm">Ezra 4:17</a> to the city of Samaria as the city in which Osnapper had settled the colonists here named, the "nations brought in by Osnapper" must be identical with those who, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/4-2.htm">Ezra 4:2</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/17-24.htm">2 Kings 17:24</a>, had been placed in the cities of Samaria by King Esarhaddon. Hence Osnapper would seem to be merely another name for Esarhaddon. But the names Osnapper (lxx &#x391;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;) and Asarhaddon (lxx &#x391;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;) being too different to be identified, and the notion that Osnapper was a second name of Asarhaddon having but little probability, together with the circumstance that Osnapper is not called king, as Asarhaddon is <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/4-2.htm">Ezra 4:2</a>, but only "the great and noble," it is more likely that he was some high functionary of Asarhaddon, who presided over the settlement of eastern races in Samaria and the lands west of the Euphrates. "In the cities," or at least the preposition &#1489;, must be supplied from the preceding &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492; before &#1504;&#1492;&#1512;&#1492; &#1506;&#1489;&#1512; &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1512;: and in the rest of the territory, or in the cities of the rest of the territory, on this side of Euphrates. &#1506;&#1489;&#1512;, trans, is to be understood of the countries west of Euphrates; matters being regarded from the point of view of the settlers, who had been transported from the territories east, to those west of Euphrates. &#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1506;&#1504;&#1514; means "and so forth," and hints that the statement is not complete.<p>On comparing the names of the nations here mentioned with the names of the cities from which, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/17-24.htm">2 Kings 17:24</a>, colonists were brought to Samaria, we find the inhabitants of most of the cities there named - Babylon, Cuthah, and Ava - here comprised under the name of the country as &#1489;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497;&#1488;, Babylonians; while the people of Hamath and Sepharvaim may fitly be included among "the rest of the nations," since certainly but few colonists would have been transported from the Syrian Hamath to Samaria. The main divergence between the two passages arises from the mention in our present verse, not only of the nations planted in the cities of Samaria, but of all the nations in the great region on this side of Euphrates (&#1504;&#1492;&#1512;&#1492; &#1506;&#1489;&#1512;). All these tribes had similar interests to defend in opposing the Jewish community, and they desired by united action to give greater force to their representation to the Persian monarch, and thus to hinder the people of Jerusalem from becoming powerful. And certainly they had some grounds for uneasiness lest the remnant of the Israelites in Palestine, and in other regions on this side the Euphrates, should combine with the Jerusalem community, and the thus united Israelites should become sufficiently powerful to oppose an effectual resistance to their heathen adversaries. On the anacoluthistic connection of <a href="/ezra/4-11.htm">Ezra 4:11</a>. &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1490;&#1503;, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/4-11.htm">Ezra 4:11</a>, <a href="/ezra/4-23.htm">Ezra 4:23</a>; <a href="/ezra/5-6.htm">Ezra 5:6</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/7-11.htm">Ezra 7:11</a>, and frequently in the Targums and the Syriac, written &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1513;&#1473;&#1490;&#1503; <a href="/esther/3-14.htm">Esther 3:14</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/esther/4-8.htm">Esther 4:8</a>, is derived from the Zendish paiti (Sanscr. prati) and enghana (in Old-Persian thanhana), and signifies properly a counterword, i.e., counterpart, copy.
