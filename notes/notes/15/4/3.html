Most certainly, confusion and obscurity in the genealogical evidence that proved the descent of the Messiah would have followed; whereas, in their hostile and separate condition, they were jealous observers of each other's proceedings, watching with mutual care over the preservation and integrity of the sacred books, guarding the purity and honor of the Mosaic worship, and thus contributing to the maintenance of religious knowledge and truth.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ezra/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Ye have nothing to do with us; </span> as being of another nation and religion, and therefore not concerned in Cyrus’s grant, which was confined to the Israelites and to the worshippers of the true God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">We ourselves together, </span> i.e. who are united together by Cyrus’s grant in this work; or, <span class="ital">alone</span>, as this word is sometimes used, as <span class="bld"><a href="/job/34-29.htm" title="When he gives quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hides his face, who then can behold him? whether it be done against a nation, or against a man only:">Job 34:29</a> <a href="/psalms/33-15.htm" title="He fashions their hearts alike; he considers all their works.">Psalm 33:15</a> <a href="/hosea/11-7.htm" title="And my people are bent to backsliding from me: though they called them to the most High, none at all would exalt him.">Hosea 11:7</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/ezra/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But Zerubbabel, and Joshua, and the rest of the chief of the fathers, said unto them,....
