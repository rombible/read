Their success in those underhand dealings was great; for Cyrus, being frequently absent and much absorbed in his warlike expeditions, left the government in the hands of his son Cambyses, a wicked prince, and extremely hostile to the Jews and their religion. The same arts were assiduously practised during the reign of his successor, Smerdis, down to the time of Darius Hystaspes.

Solomon's temple was destroyed b.c. 588, and the foundation of the subsequent temple laid b.c. 535 or 534: hence the older men among those present at the latter event might possibly have seen the former house; indeed, some (according to Hagg. Ezr 2:2) were still living in the second year of Darius Hystaspis who had beheld the glory of the earlier building. Upon these aged men, the miserable circumstances under which the foundations of the new temple were laid produced so overwhelming an impression, that they broke into loud weeping. &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1505;&#1491;&#1493; is connected by its accents with the words preceding: the former temple in its foundation, i.e., in its stability. But this can scarcely be correct.

Hence (with Aben Ezra, Cler., Berth., and others) we connect &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1505;&#1491;&#1493; with the parenthetical sentence following, "when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes;" and then the suffix of the infinitive &#1497;&#1505;&#1491;&#1493; expressly refers to the object following, as is sometimes the case in Hebrew, e.g., <a href="/2_chronicles/26-14.htm">2 Chronicles 26:14</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/9-1.htm">Ezra 9:1</a>, and mostly in Chaldee; comp.
