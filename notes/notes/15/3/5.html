Thus provision was made for all that was most essential in the ritual of religion, while the temple itself still remained unbuilt (see ver. 6). PREPARATION OF MATERIALS FOR THE REBUILDING OF THE TEMPLE (ver. 7). When the restoration of religion had pro-greased thus far, the civil and ecclesiastical rulers turned their attention to that object which had been specially mentioned in the "decree of Cyrus" (<a href="/ezra/1-2.htm">Ezra 1:2, 3</a>), the rebuilding of the temple. And, first of all, it was necessary to collect building materials, wood and stone, which were the chief materials of the first temple, and which Cyrus had particularized in a supplementary decree (<a href="/ezra/6-4.htm">Ezra 6:4</a>) as those to be employed in the construction of the second. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ezra/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Contributions towards the rebuilding of the temple, and concluding remarks. Comp. <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-70.htm">Nehemiah 7:70-73</a>. - Some of the heads of houses, when they came to the house of Jahve, i.e., arrived at the site of the temple, brought free-will offerings (&#1492;&#1514;&#1504;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;; comp. <a href="/1_chronicles/29-5.htm">1 Chronicles 29:5</a>) to set it up in its place (&#1492;&#1506;&#1502;&#1497;&#1491;, to set up, i.e., to rebuild; identical in meaning both here and <a href="/ezra/9-9.htm">Ezra 9:9</a> with &#1492;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501;). After their ability (&#1499;&#1468;&#1499;&#1493;&#1495;&#1501;; comp. <a href="/1_chronicles/29-2.htm">1 Chronicles 29:2</a>) they gave unto the treasure of the work, i.e., of restoring the temple and its services, 61,000 darics of gold  equals  68,625, and 5000 mina of silver, above 30,000, and 100 priests' garments. The account of these contributions is more accurately given in <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-70.htm">Nehemiah 7:70-72</a>, according to which some of the heads of houses gave unto the work (&#1502;&#1511;&#1510;&#1514; as <a href="/daniel/1-2.htm">Daniel 1:2</a> and elsewhere); the Tirshatha gave to the treasure 1000 darics of gold, 50 sacrificial vessels (see on <a href="/exodus/27-3.htm">Exodus 27:3</a>), 30 priests' garments, and 500 ... This last statement is defective; for the two <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/30.htm">Numbers 30</a> and 500 must not be combined into 530, as in this case the hundreds would have stood first. The objects enumerated were named before 500, and are omitted through a clerical error, &#1502;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; &#1493;&#1499;&#1505;&#1507; "and silver (500) mina." And some of the heads of houses (others than the Tirshatha) gave of gold 20,000 darics, of silver, 2200 mina; and that which the rest of the people gave was-gold, 20,000 darics, silver, 2000 mina, and 67 priests' garments. According to this statement, the Tirshatha, the heads of houses, and the rest of the people, gave together 41,000 darics in gold, 4200 mina in silver, 97 priests' garments, and 30 golden vessels. In Ezra the vessels are omitted; and instead of the 30 + 67  equals  97 priests' garments, they are stated in round numbers to have been 100. The two other differences have arisen from textual errors. Instead of 61,000 darics, it is evident that we must read with Nehemiah, 41,000 (1000 + 20,000 + 20,000); and in addition to the 2200 and 2000 mina, reckon, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-70.htm">Nehemiah 7:70</a>, 500 more, in all 4700, for which in the text of Ezra we have the round sum of 5000. The account of the return of the first band of exiles concludes at <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/2-70.htm">Ezra 2:70</a>, and the narrative proceeds to the subsequent final statement: "So the priests, etc ... .dwelt in their cities." &#1492;&#1506;&#1501; &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1503;, those of the people, are the men of the people of Israel of <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/2-2.htm">Ezra 2:2</a>, the laity as distinguished from the priests, Levites, etc. In Nehemiah the words are transposed, so that &#1492;&#1506;&#1501; &#1502;&#1503; stand after the Levitical door-keepers and singers. Bertheau thinks this position more appropriate; but we cannot but judge otherwise. The placing of the people, i.e., the laity of Israel, between the consecrated servants of the temple (the priests and their Levitical assistants in the sacrificial service) and the singers and door-keepers, seems to us quite consistent; while, on the other hand, the naming of the &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; before the &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; in Nehemiah seems inappropriate, because the performance of the choral service of the temple was a higher office than the guardianship of the doors. Neither can we regard Bertheau's view, that &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;, which in the present verse follows &#1493;&#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, should be erased, as a correct one. The word forms a perfectly appropriate close to the sentence beginning with &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;; and the sentence following, "And all Israel were in their cities," forms a well-rounded close to the account; while, on the contrary, the summing up of the different divisions by the words &#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500; in Nehemiah, after the enumeration of those divisions, has a rather heavy effect.<p>(Note: In 1 Esdr. 5:46, this verse, freely carrying out the texts of Ezra and Nehemiah, with regard also to <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-27.htm">Nehemiah 12:27-30</a>, runs thus: "And so dwelt the priests, and the Levites, and the people, in Jerusalem and in the country, the singers also and the porters, and all Israel in their villages.") </body></html>
