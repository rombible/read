Those that only knew the misery of having no temple at all, praised the Lord with shouts of joy. To them, even this foundation seemed great. We ought to be thankful for the beginnings of mercy, though it be not yet perfect. But those who remembered the glory of the first temple, and considered how far inferior this was likely to be, wept with a loud voice. There was reason for it, and if they bewailed the sin that was the cause of this melancholy change, they did well. Yet it was wrong to cast a damp upon the common joys. They despised the day of small things, and were unthankful for the good they enjoyed.

There are two ways of explaining it. (1) = ‘they made a beginning and appointed’—referring to the work generally; the verb ‘began’ being used without an object expressed. (2) = ‘began to appoint’—the two words ‘began’ and ‘appointed’ being, by a common Hebrew usage, placed coordinately. Of these two the former is the preferable. ‘Began to appoint’ gives a feeble sense. ‘Began and appointed’, i.e. ‘began by appointing’ expresses the full meaning.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Zerubbabel</span> &c., <span class="ital">and the remnant</span> &c.] R.V. … <span class="bld">and the rest</span> &c.

The prominence of the Levites in comparison with the smallness of their numbers (cf. <a href="/context/ezra/2-40.htm" title="The Levites: the children of Jeshua and Kadmiel, of the children of Hodaviah, seventy and four....">Ezra 2:40-42</a>) deserves attention. ‘Their brethren the priests and Levites’.
