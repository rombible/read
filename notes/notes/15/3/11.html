Both the temples, without all doubt, were of the same dimensions; but here was the sad difference which drew tears from the eyes of the <span class="ital">elders, </span>that in all appearance there were no hopes that the poor beginnings of the <span class="ital">latter </span>temple would ever be raised to the grandeur and magnificence of the former, since the <span class="ital">one </span>had been built by the wisest and richest king, and constantly adorned by some one or other of his posterity; the other now begun by a small company of exiles just returned from their captivity: the one in a time of profound peace and the greatest opulence; the other in a time of common calamity and distress: the one finished with the most costly stones and timber, wrought with exquisite art, and overlaid with vast quantities of gold; the other to be raised out of no better materials than what could be dug from the ruinous foundation of the old one.

This was a just matter of lamentation to those who had seen these singular tokens of the divine favour in the former temple, and a discouragement of their proceeding with the building of the present; and therefore the Prophet Haggai was sent to inform them that all these wants and defects should be abundantly repaired by the coming of the Messiah, the true Shechinah of the Divine Majesty, in the time of the second temple: (<a href="/context/ezra/2-7.htm" title="The children of Elam, a thousand two hundred fifty and four....">Ezra 2:7-9</a> :) <span class="ital">I will shake all nations, and the desire of all nations shall come; and I will fill this house with glory: the glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former, saith the Lord of hosts.” — </span>Dodd.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/ezra/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:8-13 There was a remarkable mixture of affections upon laying the foundation of the temple. Those that only knew the misery of having no temple at all, praised the Lord with shouts of joy. To them, even this foundation seemed great. We ought to be thankful for the beginnings of mercy, though it be not yet perfect. But those who remembered the glory of the first temple, and considered how far inferior this was likely to be, wept with a loud voice. There was reason for it, and if they bewailed the sin that was the cause of this melancholy change, they did well. Yet it was wrong to cast a damp upon the common joys. They despised the day of small things, and were unthankful for the good they enjoyed.

And all the people answered, Amen, Amen, with lifting up their hands: and they bowed their heads, and worshipped the LORD with their faces to the ground.">Nehemiah 8:6</a>. The traditional interpretation of this expression has seen in it an allusion to antiphonal singing, whereby a Psalm such as Psalms 136 would be rendered by two choirs, one choir singing the clause ‘O give thanks unto the Lord for He is good’, the other replying ‘for His mercy endureth for ever’ &c. There can be no doubt that certain Psalms, such as <a href="/context/psalms/24-7.htm" title="Lift up your heads, O you gates; and be you lift up, you everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in....">Psalm 24:7-10</a>; Psalms 106, 107, 118, 136, lent themselves very readily to such musical rendering; and it is possible that Nehemiah’s division of the people into two companies on a great festal occasion may favour the view that antistrophic chanting was then in vogue (<a href="/nehemiah/12-31.htm" title="Then I brought up the princes of Judah on the wall, and appointed two great companies of them that gave thanks, whereof one went on the right hand on the wall toward the dung gate:">Nehemiah 12:31</a> &c.). But, in our ignorance of early Jewish music, it is impossible to speak with certainty upon the subject, while it is very easy to import modern and Western notions into our conceptions of Oriental music. The present verb very probably means that the chant of praise was responded to with a great burst of chorus, vocal and instrumental, the substance of which was some well-known sacred refrain. Cf. <a href="/context/exodus/15-20.htm" title="And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a tambourine in her hand; and all the women went out after her with tambourines and with dances....">Exodus 15:20-21</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">because</span> he is <span class="ital">good, for his mercy</span> endureth <span class="ital">for ever</span>] R.V. ‘saying, <span class="bld">For he is good, for his mercy</span> &c.’ The clause <span class="ital">quotes</span> the refrain. It has been natural perhaps to suppose that the allusion is made to Psalms 136. But reference to other passages, where the same refrain is quoted (<a href="/1_chronicles/16-41.htm" title="And with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest that were chosen, who were expressed by name, to give thanks to the LORD, because his mercy endures for ever;">1 Chronicles 16:41</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/5-13.htm" title="It came even to pass, as the trumpeters and singers were as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the LORD; and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of music, and praised the LORD, saying, For he is good; for his mercy endures for ever: that then the house was filled with a cloud, even the house of the LORD;">2 Chronicles 5:13</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/7-3.htm" title="And when all the children of Israel saw how the fire came down, and the glory of the LORD on the house, they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground on the pavement, and worshipped, and praised the LORD, saying, For he is good; for his mercy endures for ever.">2 Chronicles 7:3</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/20-21.htm" title="And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed singers to the LORD, and that should praise the beauty of holiness, as they went out before the army, and to say, Praise the LORD; for his mercy endures for ever.">2 Chronicles 20:21</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/33-11.htm" title="The voice of joy, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the voice of them that shall say, Praise the LORD of hosts: for the LORD is good; for his mercy endures for ever: and of them that shall bring the sacrifice of praise into the house of the LORD. For I will cause to return the captivity of the land, as at the first, said the LORD.">Jeremiah 33:11</a>) shows that the words are not a quotation from a Psalm, but rather a liturgical response in frequent use at sacred festivals, upon which the well-known Psalm was founded. The present verse constitutes an interesting fulfilment to the prediction of Jeremiah (<a href="/context/jeremiah/33-10.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; Again there shall be heard in this place, which you say shall be desolate without man and without beast, even in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, that are desolate, without man, and without inhabitant, and without beast,...">Jeremiah 33:10-11</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">because the foundation … was laid</span>] The word here used occurs in <a href="/2_chronicles/3-3.htm" title="Now these are the things wherein Solomon was instructed for the building of the house of God.

But religious shouting is less common. Still we hear of such shouting when the ark of the covenant was taken into the Israelite camp near Aphek (<a href="/1_samuel/4-5.htm">1 Samuel 4:5</a>), and again when David solemnly brought it up from Kirjathjearim to Jerusalem (<a href="/2_samuel/6-15.htm">2 Samuel 6:15</a>). Shouting appears also in the Psalms (<a href="/psalms/47-5.htm">Psalm 47:5</a>) and in Zechariah (<a href="/zechariah/4-7.htm">Zechariah 4:7</a>) in connection with religion. It is always indicative of religious joy. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ezra/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>And afterward, i.e., after the feast of tabernacles, they offered the continual, i.e., the daily, burnt-offering, and (the offerings) for the new moon, and all the festivals of the Lord (the annual feasts). &#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514; must be inserted from the context before &#1500;&#1495;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; to complete the sense. "And for every one that willingly offered a free-will offering to the Lord." &#1504;&#1491;&#1489;&#1492; is a burnt-offering which was offered from free inclination. Such offerings might be brought on any day, but were chiefly presented at the annual festivals after the sacrifices prescribed by the law; comp. <a href="/numbers/29-39.htm">Numbers 29:39</a>. - In <a href="/ezra/3-6.htm">Ezra 3:6</a> follows the supplementary remark, that the sacrificial worship began from the first day of the seventh month, but that the foundation of the temple of the Lord was not yet laid. This forms a transition to what follows.<p>(Note: Bertheau, comparing <a href="/ezra/3-6.htm">Ezra 3:6</a> with <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/3-5.htm">Ezra 3:5</a>, incorrectly interprets it as meaning: "From the first day of the seventh month the offering of thank-offerings began (comp. <a href="/ezra/3-2.htm">Ezra 3:2</a>); then, from the fifteenth day of the second month, during the feast of tabernacles, the burnt-offerings prescribed by the law (<a href="/ezra/3-4.htm">Ezra 3:4</a>); but the daily burnt-offerings were not recommenced till after the feast of tabernacles, etc. Hence it was not from the first day of the seventh month, but subsequently to the feast of tabernacles, that the worship of God, so far as this consisted in burnt-offerings, was fully restored." The words of the cursive manuscript, however, do not stand in the text, but their opposite. In <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/3-2.htm">Ezra 3:2</a>, not thank-offerings (&#1494;&#1489;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; or &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;), but burnt-offerings (&#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514;), are spoken of, and indeed those prescribed in the law, among which the daily morning and evening burnt-offering, expressly named in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/3-3.htm">Ezra 3:3</a>, held the first place. With this, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/3-5.htm">Ezra 3:5</a>, "After the feast of tabernacles they offered the continual burnt-offering, and the burnt-offerings for the new moon," etc., fully harmonizes. The offering of the continual, i.e., of the daily, burnt-offerings, besides the new moon, the feast-days, and the free-will offerings, is named again merely for the sake of completeness. The right order is, on the contrary, as follows: The altar service, with the daily morning and evening sacrifice, began on the first day of the seventh month; this daily sacrifice was regularly offered, according to the law, from then till the fifteenth day of the second month, i.e., till the beginning of the feast of tabernacles; all the offerings commanded in the law for the separate days of this feast were then offered according to the numbers prescribed; and after this festival the sacrifices ordered at the new moon and the other holy days of the year were offered, as well as the daily burnt-offerings, - none but these, neither the sacrifice on the new moon (the first day of the seventh month) nor the sin-offering on the tenth day of the same month, i.e., the day of atonement, having been offered before this feast of tabernacles.)</body></html>
