The document describes, with great clearness and precision, the nature of Ezra's commission and the extent of power and prerogatives with which he was invested. It gave him authority, in the first place, to organize the colony in Judea and institute a regular government, according to the laws of the Hebrew people, and by magistrates and rulers of their own nation (Ezr 7:25, 26), with power to punish offenders by fines, imprisonment, exile, or death, according to the degree of their criminality. Secondly, he was empowered to carry a large donation in money, partly from the royal treasury and partly raised by voluntary contributions among his countrymen, to create a fund out of which to make suitable provision for maintaining the regular worship of God in Jerusalem (Ezr 7:16, 17). Thirdly, the Persian officers in Syria were commanded to afford him every assistance by gifts of money within a certain specified limit, in carrying out the objects of his patriotic mission (Ezr 7:21).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ezra/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/ezra/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And to carry the silver and gold, which the king and his counsellors have freely offered unto the God of Israel, whose habitation is in Jerusalem.

That they went up with Ezra appears from the context, and is expressly stated both in the royal edict (<a href="/ezra/7-13.htm">Ezra 7:13</a>) and in the further description of the expedition (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/7-28.htm">Ezra 7:28</a>, <a href="/ezra/8-1.htm">Ezra 8:1</a>). They went up in the seventh year of Artaxerxes, and reached Jerusalem in the fifth month of that year. - In <a href="/ezra/7-8.htm">Ezra 7:8</a> Ezra is again, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/7-6.htm">Ezra 7:6</a>, the subject of the sentence; the intervening seventh verse being really only in apposition with <a href="/ezra/7-6.htm">Ezra 7:6</a>. - In <a href="/ezra/7-9.htm">Ezra 7:9</a> the time occupied by the journey is more precisely defined; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; is explanatory. Namely, on the first day of the first month, he had appointed the journey from Babylon, etc. The Keri &#1497;&#1505;&#1491; &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; can only mean, ipsum erat fundamentum profectionis, as J. H. Mich. after R. Sal. explains it, for &#1497;&#1505;&#1491; is pointed as the construct state. The departure of the expedition from the place of meeting occurred, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/8-31.htm">Ezra 8:31</a>, on the twelfth day of the first month. Since, however, they encamped three days there, making the final preparations for their journey, eleven days might easily elapse between the period when the whole caravan had assembled, and the day of actual departure. The Keri offers no appropriate signification; for since &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; can only be taken for the subject, and &#1492;&#1501; &#1497;&#1505;&#1491; for the predicate, the sentence would contain an anacoluthon. To translate &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; by ipsum cannot be justified by the usages of the language, for there is no such emphasis on &#1497;&#1505;&#1491; as to cause &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; to be regarded as an emphatic reference to the following noun. &#1497;&#1505;&#1491; must be pointed &#1497;&#1505;&#1491; or &#1497;&#1505;&#1468;&#1491;, as the third pers. perf.
