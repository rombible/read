The document describes, with great clearness and precision, the nature of Ezra's commission and the extent of power and prerogatives with which he was invested. It gave him authority, in the first place, to organize the colony in Judea and institute a regular government, according to the laws of the Hebrew people, and by magistrates and rulers of their own nation (Ezr 7:25, 26), with power to punish offenders by fines, imprisonment, exile, or death, according to the degree of their criminality. Secondly, he was empowered to carry a large donation in money, partly from the royal treasury and partly raised by voluntary contributions among his countrymen, to create a fund out of which to make suitable provision for maintaining the regular worship of God in Jerusalem (Ezr 7:16, 17). Thirdly, the Persian officers in Syria were commanded to afford him every assistance by gifts of money within a certain specified limit, in carrying out the objects of his patriotic mission (Ezr 7:21).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ezra/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/ezra/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>The vessels also that were given thee for the service of the house of thy God,....

Rather, it would seem, they were a part of the voluntary "offering" mentioned in ver. 15, in which they are distinctly included (Ezra 8:25-28). We may perhaps conclude that the vessels sent with Zerubbabel had proved insufficient in number for the great festivals. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ezra/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The letter containing the royal commission is given in the Chaldee original. It is questionable what explanation must be given to &#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1512; in the title. If it were the adjective belonging to &#1491;&#1468;&#1514;&#1488; &#1505;&#1508;&#1512;, we should expect the emphatic state &#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1512;&#1488;. Hence Bertheau combines it with the following &#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1506;&#1504;&#1514; as an abbreviation, "completeness, etc.," which would signify that in the royal commission itself this introductory formula would be found fully given, and that all the words here missing are represented by &#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1506;&#1504;&#1514;. This would be, at all events, an extremely strange expression. We incline to regard &#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1512; as an adverb used adjectively: To the scribe in the law of God perfectly, for the perfect scribe, etc., corresponding with the translation of the Vulgate, doctissimo. The commission begins with an order that those Israelites who desire to go to Jerusalem should depart with Ezra, because the king and his seven counsellors send him to order matters in Judah and Jerusalem according to the law of God, and to carry thither presents and free-will offerings as a contribution towards the sacrifices, and other matters necessary for the worship of God, <a href="/ezra/7-13.htm">Ezra 7:13</a>.
