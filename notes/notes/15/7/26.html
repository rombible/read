Fourthly, Artaxerxes gave his royal sanction in the establishment of the divine law, which exempted priests and Levites from taxation or tribute and confirmed to them the exclusive right to officiate in the sacred services of the sanctuary. And, finally, in the expression of the king's desire for the divine blessing upon the king and his government (Ezr 7:23), we see the strong persuasion which pervaded the Persian court, and had been produced by the captivity of the Hebrew people, as to the being and directing providence of the God they worshipped. It will be observed, however, that the commission related exclusively to the rebuilding of the temple&#8212;not of the walls. The Samaritans (Ezr 4:20-22) had succeeded in alarming the Persian court by their representations of the danger to the empire of fortifying a city notorious for the turbulent character of its inhabitants and the prowess of its kings.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ezra/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The law of thy God, and the law of the king, </span> to wit, concerning these matters.

These powers were always intrusted by the Persians to the civil administrators of provinces, who were autocrats within their respective territories, and responsible to the king alone for the exercise of their authority. EZRA'S THANKSGIVING ON RECEIPT OF ARTAXERXES' LETTER (<a href="/ezra/7-27.htm">Ezra 7:27, 28</a>). With an abruptness that may appear strange, but which has many parallels in the works of Oriental writers, Ezra passes without a word of explanation from Artaxerxes' letter to his own thanksgiving upon the receipt of it. Compare the interjectional prayers of Nehemiah (<a href="/nehemiah/4-4.htm">Nehemiah 4:4</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/5-19.htm">Nehemiah 5:19</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/6-9.htm">Nehemiah 6:9, 14</a>, etc.). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ezra/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Ezra is to defray the expenses of all other things necessary for the temple from the royal treasury, on which account a royal order is despatched to the treasurer on this side the river. "And whatsoever more shall be needful for the house of thy God, which thou shalt have occasion to give" (i.e., whatever necessary expenses shall be incurred which cannot be determined beforehand), and for which the gifts and contributions already furnished to Ezra shall not suffice, he is to give, i.e., to defray, out of the house of the king's treasures, i.e., the royal treasury. For this purpose Artaxerxes commands all the treasures on this side the river, that whatsoever Ezra shall require of them shall be immediately done. &#1488;&#1504;&#1492; is an emphatic repetition of the pronoun, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/7-15.htm">Daniel 7:15</a>, and frequently in Hebrew.</body></html>
