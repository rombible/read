The king was kind to him; he granted all his requests, whatever Ezra desired to enable him to serve his country. When he went, many went with him; he obtained favour from his king, by the Divine favour. Every creature is that to us, which God makes it to be. We must see the hand of God in the events that befal us, and acknowledge him with thankfulness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ezra/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>After these things - The words mark an interval of 57 years; if, with most commentators, we take Artaxerxes to be Longimanus. See the introduction to the Book of Ezra. Three kings named Artaxerxes, the Greek rendering of the Hebrew Artakhshasta, and the Persian Artakhshatra, ruled over Persia, namely,: Longimanus, Mnemon, and Ochus. The evidence is in favor of the first being meant here: he was the grandson of Darius Hystaspis, Jeshua's contemporary.<p>The genealogy of Ezra here is incomplete. The time between the Exodus and Ezra must have exceeded one thousand years, and cannot have been covered by 16 generations. One gap may be filled up from <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-7.htm">1 Chronicles 6:7-10</a>, which supplies six names between Meraioth and Azariah <a href="/ezra/7-3.htm">Ezra 7:3</a> : another gap probably occurs between Seraiah <a href="/ezra/7-1.htm">Ezra 7:1</a> and Ezra himself; since Seraiah appears to be the high priest of Zedekiah's time (marginal reference), who lived at least 130 years before Ezra. Three or four names are probably missing in this place. Another name (Meraioth) may be supplied from <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-11.htm">1 Chronicles 9:11</a>, between Zadok and Ahitub <a href="/ezra/7-2.htm">Ezra 7:2</a>. These additions would produce 27 generations - a number nearly sufficient - instead of 16 generations. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ezra/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 7<p>Ezr 7:1-10.

Seraiah was the high priest put to death by Nebuchadnezzar at Riblah (2Ki 25:18). A period of one hundred thirty years had elapsed between that catastrophe and the journey of Ezra to Jerusalem. As a grandson of Seraiah, namely, Jeshua, who held the office of high priest, had accompanied Zerubbabel in the first caravan of returning exiles, Ezra must have been in all probability a grandson, descended, too, from a younger son, the older branch being in possession of the pontificate.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ezra/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/ezra/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Now after these things,....

We may gather from <a href="/1_chronicles/9-11.htm">1 Chronicles 9:11</a> that a Meraioth is also omitted between the Zadok and Ahitub of ver. 2. EZRA'S JOURNEY FROM BABYLON TO JERUSALEM, WITH DATES (Xerxes 7:6-10). In introducing himself, Ezra seems to regard it 25 of primary importance to state two things  - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> who he was, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> what place he had in a history of which the main object is to give an account of the return of Israel from captivity. In connection with the former point, he gives, first of all, his genealogy; and, secondly, the account of himself contained in vers. 6 and 10. He describes himself as "a ready scribe" - one who "had prepared his heart to seek the law of the Lord, and to do it," and also "to teach in Israel statutes and judgments." In connection with the latter, he is careful to put before us at once the fact that he too, like Zerubbabel, "went up from Babylon" to Jerusalem by the permission of the Persian king, and, like Zerubbabel, was accompanied by priests, Levites, both singers and porters, Nethinim, and a number of the people (ver. 7). He adds an exact statement as to the date of both his departure and arrival, very natural in one who is his own biographer, and very interesting to the general historian. He also, without any parade of religious sentiment, acknowledges the baud of God as directing, helping, and sustaining him in all his proceedings, ascribing to the Divine favour, especially, Artaxerxes allowance of his journey, and his safe accomplishment of it within a moderate space of time (vers. 6, 9). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ezra/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>At the same time, the priests and Levites were appointed, according to their classes and divisions, to the service of the temple, that they might henceforth fulfil their office, each class in its week (<a href="/2_chronicles/23-4.htm">2 Chronicles 23:4</a>; <a href="/2_kings/11-9.htm">2 Kings 11:9</a>). &#1493;&#1492;&#1511;&#1497;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468; corresponds with the Hebrew &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1502;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/3-8.htm">Ezra 3:8</a>, and elsewhere. As Bertheau justly remarks, "The services of public worship, which after the completion of the temple were to be performed by the priests and Levites, according to ancient ordinance, are here spoken of." With these words the Chaldee section closes. </body></html>
