"And whatsoever more shall be needful for the house of thy God, which thou shalt have occasion to give" (i.e., whatever necessary expenses shall be incurred which cannot be determined beforehand), and for which the gifts and contributions already furnished to Ezra shall not suffice, he is to give, i.e., to defray, out of the house of the king's treasures, i.e., the royal treasury. For this purpose Artaxerxes commands all the treasures on this side the river, that whatsoever Ezra shall require of them shall be immediately done. &#1488;&#1504;&#1492; is an emphatic repetition of the pronoun, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/7-15.htm">Daniel 7:15</a>, and frequently in Hebrew.</body></html>
