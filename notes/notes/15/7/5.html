The king was kind to him; he granted all his requests, whatever Ezra desired to enable him to serve his country. When he went, many went with him; he obtained favour from his king, by the Divine favour. Every creature is that to us, which God makes it to be. We must see the hand of God in the events that befal us, and acknowledge him with thankfulness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ezra/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>After these things - The words mark an interval of 57 years; if, with most commentators, we take Artaxerxes to be Longimanus. See the introduction to the Book of Ezra. Three kings named Artaxerxes, the Greek rendering of the Hebrew Artakhshasta, and the Persian Artakhshatra, ruled over Persia, namely,: Longimanus, Mnemon, and Ochus. The evidence is in favor of the first being meant here: he was the grandson of Darius Hystaspis, Jeshua's contemporary.<p>The genealogy of Ezra here is incomplete. The time between the Exodus and Ezra must have exceeded one thousand years, and cannot have been covered by 16 generations. One gap may be filled up from <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-7.htm">1 Chronicles 6:7-10</a>, which supplies six names between Meraioth and Azariah <a href="/ezra/7-3.htm">Ezra 7:3</a> : another gap probably occurs between Seraiah <a href="/ezra/7-1.htm">Ezra 7:1</a> and Ezra himself; since Seraiah appears to be the high priest of Zedekiah's time (marginal reference), who lived at least 130 years before Ezra. Three or four names are probably missing in this place. Another name (Meraioth) may be supplied from <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-11.htm">1 Chronicles 9:11</a>, between Zadok and Ahitub <a href="/ezra/7-2.htm">Ezra 7:2</a>. These additions would produce 27 generations - a number nearly sufficient - instead of 16 generations. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ezra/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 7<p>Ezr 7:1-10.

Seraiah was the high priest put to death by Nebuchadnezzar at Riblah (2Ki 25:18). A period of one hundred thirty years had elapsed between that catastrophe and the journey of Ezra to Jerusalem. As a grandson of Seraiah, namely, Jeshua, who held the office of high priest, had accompanied Zerubbabel in the first caravan of returning exiles, Ezra must have been in all probability a grandson, descended, too, from a younger son, the older branch being in possession of the pontificate.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ezra/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/ezra/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Now after these things,....

The expression is not essentially different from &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1514; &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;,   <a href="/ezra/9-1.htm">Ezra 9:1</a>., <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/3-3.htm">Ezra 3:3</a>, and is only distinguishable therefrom, inasmuch as the latter appellation includes not merely the heathen inhabitants of Palestine, but also the heathen of other lands, as the Moabites, Ammonites, Egyptians, etc. (<a href="/ezra/9-1.htm">Ezra 9:1</a>.). Those who had separated themselves from the uncleanness of the heathen to them (the Jews) to seek Jahve, are not proselytes from heathenism (Aben Ezra, Rashi, Clericus, and others), but Israelites, who had till now lived in Palestine, and mingled with the heathen inhabitants of the land. They were descended from those Israelites whom the kings of Assyria and Babylon had not carried away from the realms of Israel and Judah, and who with respect to religion had combined heathenism and the worship of Jahve (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/17-32.htm">2 Kings 17:32</a>, etc.), and thus defiled themselves with heathen impurity, but who now, after the erection of the temple, joined themselves to the new community, for the purpose of worshipping with them the God of their fathers in His temple, according to the law of Moses. For, as Bertheau rightly remarks, "in the days of Ezra the princes of the new community complain that the laity, the priests, and Levites do not separate from the people of the lands (<a href="/ezra/9-1.htm">Ezra 9:1</a>); reference is made to the dangers which threaten the Israelites, because they dwell in the holy land among the unclean (<a href="/ezra/9-10.htm">Ezra 9:10</a>). To separate from the uncleanness of the nations means to renounce intermarriage and other connection with them. <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/10-2.htm">Ezra 10:2</a>, <a href="/ezra/10-10.htm">Ezra 10:10</a>. They are Israelites who are summoned, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/10-11.htm">Ezra 10:11</a>, to separate from the peoples of the land; the seed of Israel is, in <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-2.htm">Nehemiah 9:2</a>, separated from the sons of the stranger, and in <a href="/nehemiah/10-29.htm">Nehemiah 10:29</a> they who separate from them are evidently Israelites, for, when they bind themselves to walk according to the law of God, they are said to join their brethren, i.e., their fellow-countrymen." Hence in this passage also we cannot but regard those who separated themselves as Israelites, dissolving their connection with the heathen for the sake of the God of Israel.</body></html>
