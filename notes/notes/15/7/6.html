Ezra was a priest, and this title is rightly placed before that of scribe in what follows; but here at the outset, when he first appears in history, the title is used which expressed his pre-eminent function, that of guarding and interpreting the law (<a href="/ezra/7-10.htm" title="For Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the law of the LORD, and to do it, and to teach in Israel statutes and judgments.">Ezra 7:10</a>).<p><span class= "bld">All his request.</span>—This anticipates the letter of <a href="/ezra/7-11.htm" title="Now this is the copy of the letter that the king Artaxerxes gave to Ezra the priest, the scribe, even a scribe of the words of the commandments of the LORD, and of his statutes to Israel.">Ezra 7:11</a>; a series of supplementary notes intervenes.<p><span class= "bld">According to the hand of the Lord his God upon him.</span>—The full formula for that special providence over God’s servants which both Ezra and Nehemiah recognised.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/ezra/7.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/ezra/7-6.htm" title="This Ezra went up from Babylon; and he was a ready scribe in the law of Moses, which the LORD God of Israel had given: and the king granted him all his request, according to the hand of the LORD his God on him.">Ezra 7:6</a></span>. <span class="ital">This Ezra went up from Babylon — </span>With the king’s consent and commission. <span class="ital">And he was a ready scribe in the law of Moses — </span>He is called a <span class="ital">scribe, </span>as Buxtorf observes in his Tiberias, not from writing and describing, but from declaring and explicating those things that are contained in the Scripture.

And, there being no book comparable to the book of the law, therefore <span class="ital">Sopher </span>became a name of great dignity, and signified one that taught God’s law, and expounded it to his people. Thus, in the New Testament, the scribes were those who instructed the people in the law. It is said he was a <span class="ital">ready scribe, </span>because he was expert in the law, and understood it thoroughly, both in all things belonging to the priesthood, and to the civil power; in which he was so well versed, that he could give a ready account of any part of it. The Jews say, he collected and collated all the copies of the law, and published an accurate edition of it, with all the books that were given by divine inspiration, and so made up the canon of the Old Testament. Moses in Egypt, and Ezra in Babylon, were wonderfully fitted for eminent service in the church. This was the second time that Ezra came up from Babylon, for he came up at first with Zerubbabel, as we learn from <a href="/nehemiah/12-1.htm" title="Now these are the priests and the Levites that went up with Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua: Seraiah, Jeremiah, Ezra,">Nehemiah 12:1</a>, and probably returned to Babylon to persuade those who had staid behind to come up to Jerusalem, and to obtain some further assistance from the king. <span class="ital">According to the hand of the Lord his God upon him — </span>God not only stirred up Ezra to this undertaking, but was so favourable to him as to incline the king to give a gracious answer to his petition.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/ezra/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:1-10 Ezra went from Babylon to Jerusalem, for the good of his country. The king was kind to him; he granted all his requests, whatever Ezra desired to enable him to serve his country. When he went, many went with him; he obtained favour from his king, by the Divine favour. Every creature is that to us, which God makes it to be.

The professional scribe was well known in Egypt from an early date (see <a href="/genesis/39-4.htm">Genesis 39:4</a> note); and under David and his successors "scribes" were attached to the court as the king's secretaries (<a href="/2_samuel/8-17.htm">2 Samuel 8:17</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/20-25.htm">2 Samuel 20:25</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/12-10.htm">2 Kings 12:10</a>, etc.). It was scarcely, however, until the time of the captivity that the class to which Ezra belonged arose. The "scribes" of this time, and of later Jewish history, were students, interpreters, and copiers of the Law (see the marginal references and <a href="/jeremiah/8-8.htm">Jeremiah 8:8</a>). They retained the knowledge of the old dialect, which was being rapidly superseded by a new one. The emphatic application of the title "the scribe" to Ezra marks the high honor in which the office was now held. Its glories eclipsed those of the priesthood.<p>The hand of the Lord ... upon him - The use of this phrase in a good sense is rare elsewhere (compare <a href="/1_kings/18-46.htm">1 Kings 18:46</a>), but is a favorite one with both Ezra and Nehemiah (see the marginal references; <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-8.htm">Nehemiah 2:8</a>, <a href="/nehemiah/2-18.htm">Nehemiah 2:18</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ezra/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. This Ezra &#8230; was a ready scribe in the law of Moses&#8212;The term "scribe" does not mean merely a penman, nor even an attorney well versed in forms of law and skilled in the method of preparing public or private deeds. He was a rabbi, or doctor, learned in the Mosaic law, and in all that related to the civil and ecclesiastical polity and customs of the Hebrew people. Scribes of this description possessed great authority and influence (compare Mt 23:25; Mr 12:28).<p>the king granted him all his request&#8212;left Babylon entrusted with an important commission to be executed in Jerusalem. The manner in which he obtained this office is minutely related in a subsequent passage. Here it is noticed, but with a pious acknowledgment of the divine grace and goodness which disposed the royal mind in favor of Ezra's patriotic objects. The Levites, &c., did not go at that time, but are mentioned here by anticipation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ezra/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Ezra went up from Babylon, </span> with the king’s consent and commission. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">A ready scribe, </span> i.e. a learned and expert doctor; for in that sense the word <span class="ital">scribe</span> is oft used, as <span class="bld"><a href="/jeremiah/8-8.htm" title="How do you say, We are wise, and the law of the LORD is with us?

See, certainly in vain made he it; the pen of the scribes is in vain.">Jeremiah 8:8</a> ‘How do ye say, We are wise, and the law of the Lord is with us? But, behold, the false pen of the scribes hath wrought falsely’.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>After the Captivity, the increased importance of the written law and the necessity of explaining its obligation upon the people brought ‘the scribes’ into great prominence. ‘The scribe’ took the place of the prophet and, in his influence upon his countrymen, eclipsed the priest. The name of Ezra is associated with the development of ‘the scribe’ and he is designated ‘the scribe’ as by an honourable title in <a href="/ezra/7-11.htm" title="Now this is the copy of the letter that the king Artaxerxes gave to Ezra the priest, the scribe, even a scribe of the words of the commandments of the LORD, and of his statutes to Israel.">Ezra 7:11</a>, and <a href="/nehemiah/8-1.htm" title="And all the people gathered themselves together as one man into the street that was before the water gate; and they spoke to Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses, which the LORD had commanded to Israel.">Nehemiah 8:1</a>. He was the typical representative and in a measure the founder of the later type of scribes. Devoted to the minute study of the written law, he sought to expound it to his people and to impress upon them the duty of its rigid observance. (See Introduction.) To the same class perhaps belonged ‘the teachers’ mentioned in <a href="/ezra/8-16.htm" title="Then sent I for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for Elnathan, and for Jarib, and for Elnathan, and for Nathan, and for Zechariah, and for Meshullam, chief men; also for Joiarib, and for Elnathan, men of understanding.">Ezra 8:16</a>, and ‘Zadok the scribe’ (<a href="/nehemiah/13-13.htm" title="And I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and next to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah: for they were counted faithful, and their office was to distribute to their brothers.">Nehemiah 13:13</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The word ‘ready’ is the same as appears elsewhere in the O.T. only in <a href="/psalms/45-1.htm" title="My heart is gushing a good matter: I speak of the things which I have made touching the king: my tongue is the pen of a ready writer.">Psalm 45:1</a> ‘a <span class="ital">ready</span> writer’. <a href="/proverbs/22-29.htm" title="See you a man diligent in his business? he shall stand before kings; he shall not stand before mean men.">Proverbs 22:29</a> ‘<span class="ital">diligent</span> in his business’. <a href="/isaiah/16-5.htm" title="And in mercy shall the throne be established: and he shall sit on it in truth in the tabernacle of David, judging, and seeking judgment, and hastening righteousness.">Isaiah 16:5</a> ‘<span class="ital">swift</span> to do righteousness’.

So they strengthened their hands for this good work.">Nehemiah 2:18</a>, and in a slightly different form <a href="/ezra/8-22.htm" title="For I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way: because we had spoken to the king, saying, The hand of our God is on all them for good that seek him; but his power and his wrath is against all them that forsake him.">Ezra 8:22</a>; <a href="/ezra/8-31.htm" title="Then we departed from the river of Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month, to go to Jerusalem: and the hand of our God was on us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy, and of such as lay in wait by the way.">Ezra 8:31</a>. ‘The hand of the Lord’ denotes the merciful favour, as may be seen from the context here and in <a href="/ezra/7-28.htm" title="And has extended mercy to me before the king, and his counsellors, and before all the king's mighty princes. And I was strengthened as the hand of the LORD my God was on me, and I gathered together out of Israel chief men to go up with me.">Ezra 7:28</a>, even without the addition of the adjective good: cf. ‘the eye of the Lord’, chap. <a href="/ezra/5-5.htm" title="But the eye of their God was on the elders of the Jews, that they could not cause them to cease, till the matter came to Darius: and then they returned answer by letter concerning this matter.">Ezra 5:5</a>. Similar is the phrase in <a href="/2_chronicles/30-12.htm" title="Also in Judah the hand of God was to give them one heart to do the commandment of the king and of the princes, by the word of the LORD.">2 Chronicles 30:12</a>. From that ‘hand’ comes discipline as well as bounty, <a href="/job/2-10.htm" title="But he said to her, You speak as one of the foolish women speaks. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips.">Job 2:10</a> ‘Shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil?’ <a href="/job/19-21.htm" title="Have pity on me, have pity on me, O you my friends; for the hand of God has touched me.">Job 19:21</a> ‘the hand of God hath touched me’. In adversity ‘the hand of the Lord’ is described as ‘<span class="ital">against</span>’, not ‘upon’ a person.

It is characteristic of Ezra's piety never to forget that the law was not a mere human code given by an earthly lawgiver, not even a national treasure, the accumulation of centuries, but a direct Divine gift "the law of the Lord" (ver. 10), "the words of the commandments of the Lord, and of his statutes to Israel" (ver. 11), "the law which the Lord had commanded by Moses" (<a href="/nehemiah/8-14.htm">Nehemiah 8:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">According to the hand of the Lord his God upon him</span>. <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "by reason of God's favour to him."

The king of Assur is the Persian king Darius, who as ruler of the former realm of Assyria is thus designated.
