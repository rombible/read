Fourthly, Artaxerxes gave his royal sanction in the establishment of the divine law, which exempted priests and Levites from taxation or tribute and confirmed to them the exclusive right to officiate in the sacred services of the sanctuary. And, finally, in the expression of the king's desire for the divine blessing upon the king and his government (Ezr 7:23), we see the strong persuasion which pervaded the Persian court, and had been produced by the captivity of the Hebrew people, as to the being and directing providence of the God they worshipped. It will be observed, however, that the commission related exclusively to the rebuilding of the temple&#8212;not of the walls.

Egypt had revolted from the Persians in  <span class="date">B.C. 460</span>, and in the following year, with the assistance of the Athenians, had driven the last Persian out of the country. A vain attempt was made by an embassy to Sparta, towards the close of  <span class="date">B.C. 459</span>, to force Athens to recall her troops. In  <span class="date">B.C. 458</span>, Artaxerxes' seventh year, it was resolved that a Persian force should attempt the recovery of the revolted country. Artaxerxes gives his <span class="accented">firman</span> to Ezra when this expedition is preparing to start, and partly alludes to the past "wrath," shown in the success of the rebels, partly deprecates any further visitation. Without pretending to penetrate the Divine counsels, it may be noticed that from the year  <span class="date">B.C. 458</span> things went well for the Persians in Egypt. Memphis was recovered in that year or the next; and in  <span class="date">B.C. 455</span> the Athenians were finally defeated, and the province recovered. <span class="cmt_word">The king and his</span> <span class="cmt_word">sons.</span> This mention of the "sons" of Artaxerxes has been regarded as a proof that the Artaxerxes of Esther was Mnemon, and not Longimanus (Patrick). But it is quite a gratuitous supposition that Longimanus, who had attained to manhood before he ascended the throne, had no sons in the seventh year of his reign. Ultimately he left behind him eighteen sons (Ctesias, 'Exc. Pers.,' &sect; 44). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ezra/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The application of these contributions. &#1491;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1511;&#1489;&#1500;, for this very reason, sc. because furnished by the king and his counsellors, and by the heathen and Israelite inhabitants of Babylon, thou shalt diligently buy with this money bullocks, rams, lambs, with their meat-offerings and their drink-offerings (the meat and drink offerings pertaining by the law, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/15-1.htm">Numbers 15:1</a>, etc., to the sacrifices), and offer them upon the altar ...
