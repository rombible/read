The evidence is in favor of the first being meant here: he was the grandson of Darius Hystaspis, Jeshua's contemporary.<p>The genealogy of Ezra here is incomplete. The time between the Exodus and Ezra must have exceeded one thousand years, and cannot have been covered by 16 generations.

Three or four names are probably missing in this place. Another name (Meraioth) may be supplied from <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-11.htm">1 Chronicles 9:11</a>, between Zadok and Ahitub <a href="/ezra/7-2.htm">Ezra 7:2</a>.

As a grandson of Seraiah, namely, Jeshua, who held the office of high priest, had accompanied Zerubbabel in the first caravan of returning exiles, Ezra must have been in all probability a grandson, descended, too, from a younger son, the older branch being in possession of the pontificate.Ezra’s genealogy, <span class="bld"><a href="/context/ezra/7-1.htm" title="Now after these things, in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Ezra the son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah,...">Ezra 7:1-5</a></span>.

Ezra’s Genealogy<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Now after these things</span>] An interval of 58 years is passed over in silence (516–458). One allusion has already been made to the reign of Xerxes (ch. <a href="/ezra/4-6.htm" title="And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, wrote they to him an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.">Ezra 4:6</a>). But with this exception the Compiler apparently found nothing to record of historic importance in the formation of the new religious community at Jerusalem during the period which elapsed between the completion of the Temple and the accession of Artaxerxes. The story of Esther belongs to Xerxes’ reign, which belongs to the chronicles of ‘the Dispersion’. It has no part in the development of the Jewish constitution. ‘Now after these things’. A not infrequent phrase combining connexion (‘now’ or ‘and’) with the previous narrative and statement of indefinite interval. Cf. <a href="/genesis/15-1.htm" title="After these things the word of the LORD came to Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am your shield, and your exceeding great reward.">Genesis 15:1</a>; <a href="/genesis/22-1.htm" title="And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said to him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am.">Genesis 22:1</a>; <a href="/luke/10-1.htm" title="After these things the LORD appointed other seventy also, and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place, where he himself would come.">Luke 10:1</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in the reign of Artaxerxes</span>] Artaxerxes the son of Xerxes began to reign in 465 b.c.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Ezra, the son of Seraiah</span> &c.] Ezra’s genealogy is here traced back to Aaron.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="ital">a</span>) His immediate connexion with the high-priestly line is through Seraiah. He is therefore here called ‘the son of Seraiah’, although Seraiah was High-priest in the days of king Zedekiah and was slain at Riblah by Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="/context/2_kings/25-18.htm" title="And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door:...">2 Kings 25:18-21</a>) in 588 b.c. (i.e. 130 years before). Inasmuch as (1) the High-priest Jeshua (538) is described as the son of Jehozadak, (2) neither of these names occurs in Ezra’s genealogy, (3) Jehozadak was the eldest son of Seraiah (<a href="/1_chronicles/6-14.htm" title="And Azariah begat Seraiah, and Seraiah begat Jehozadak,">1 Chronicles 6:14</a>) succeeding to the High-priesthood, we conclude that Ezra was descended from a younger son of Seraiah.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="ital">b</span>) In this genealogy 15 names occur between Ezra and Aaron. This is manifestly too small a number for a period of about 1000 years (reckoning 30 years to a generation), especially when we find 26 names recorded between Zerubbabel (who was of the previous generation to that of Ezra) and Nashon, prince of Judah, the contemporary of Aaron, in <a href="/context/1_chronicles/2-10.htm" title="And Ram begat Amminadab; and Amminadab begat Nahshon, prince of the children of Judah;...">1 Chronicles 2:10-15</a>; <a href="/context/1_chronicles/3-1.htm" title="Now these were the sons of David, which were born to him in Hebron; the firstborn Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess; the second Daniel, of Abigail the Carmelitess:...">1 Chronicles 3:1-19</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Ezra’s genealogy therefore appears here in an abbreviated form.

At least <span class="ital">three</span> and possibly <span class="ital">four</span> generations must be inserted between Seraiah (died 588) and Ezra (? died circ. 430), the names being here omitted because they were not High-priests.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="ital">c</span>) Why does Ezra’s genealogy appear in this abbreviated form, if the materials of a fuller one were accessible to the compiler of our book in the materials of the book ‘Chronicles’?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(i) Jewish genealogies were often abbreviated by the omission of unimportant or dishonourable names, for the sake of securing a shorter list or an arrangement of names more easily remembered (see <a href="/genesis/11-13.htm" title="And Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.">Genesis 11:13</a>; cf. <a href="/luke/3-36.htm" title="Which was the son of Cainan, which was the son of Arphaxad, which was the son of Sem, which was the son of Noe, which was the son of Lamech,">Luke 3:36</a> and <a href="/matthew/1-8.htm" title="And Asa begat Josaphat; and Josaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Ozias;">Matthew 1:8</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is possible that the present genealogy was artificially arranged. By reference to <a href="/1_chronicles/6-10.htm" title="And Johanan begat Azariah, (he it is that executed the priest's office in the temple that Solomon built in Jerusalem:)">1 Chronicles 6:10</a>, we find that Azariah (<a href="/ezra/7-3.htm" title="The son of Amariah, the son of Azariah, the son of Meraioth,">Ezra 7:3</a>) is there specially described as ‘having executed the priest’s office in the house that Solomon built in Jerusalem’. Azariah’s name therefore represents the age of the foundation of the Temple, just as Aaron’s name represents the foundation of the Levitical system, Ezra’s its reconstitution. It is noteworthy that between Ezra and Azariah there are seven names, between Azariah and Aaron seven names: the first group contains the names of High-priests before the setting up of the Monarchy and before the Temple was built, the second group contains the list of the High-priests during the Monarchy down to the destruction of Jerusalem. It is possible that this twofold arrangement of seven names placed between the two names representative of the foundation and the revival of the Mosaic system, and linked by the name representative of the Temple, may be the explanation of the abbreviation (cf. the threefold grouping by ‘fourteen’ in <a href="/context/matthew/1-1.htm" title="The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham....">Matthew 1:1-16</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(ii) On the other hand it must be granted that a list containing two trios of Amariah, Ahitub, Zadok, <span class="ital">three</span> Azariahs, <span class="ital">two</span> Amariahs, and a Meraioth could easily give rise to errors in transcription; a copyist’s eye passing from one similar name or termination to another. It is thus quite possible that after Azariah (No. 15) the copyist accidentally passed on to Meraioth (No. 8) which followed the similarly sounding Amariah.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is clear from the fewness of the names and from the omission of all names after Seraiah that the genealogy cannot pretend to be complete. The view that the six names (9–14) have <span class="ital">accidentally</span> dropped from the text, rests on the omission of the renowned Zadok and Ahimaaz, whose names we should naturally expect to find inserted in a list of Ezra’s forefathers (<a href="/1_chronicles/6-8.htm" title="And Ahitub begat Zadok, and Zadok begat Ahimaaz,">1 Chronicles 6:8</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Hilkiah</span>] the celebrated High-priest of the reign of Josiah: see <a href="/2_kings/22-4.htm" title="Go up to Hilkiah the high priest, that he may sum the silver which is brought into the house of the LORD, which the keepers of the door have gathered of the people:">2 Kings 22:4</a>, &c.; <a href="/2_chronicles/34-14.htm" title="And when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of the LORD, Hilkiah the priest found a book of the law of the LORD given by Moses.">2 Chronicles 34:14</a>, &c.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezra/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - The writer makes a marked division between his first and second sections by means of the words, "<span class="cmt_word">Now after these things</span>," which he uses in this place only.
