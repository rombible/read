The document describes, with great clearness and precision, the nature of Ezra's commission and the extent of power and prerogatives with which he was invested. It gave him authority, in the first place, to organize the colony in Judea and institute a regular government, according to the laws of the Hebrew people, and by magistrates and rulers of their own nation (Ezr 7:25, 26), with power to punish offenders by fines, imprisonment, exile, or death, according to the degree of their criminality. Secondly, he was empowered to carry a large donation in money, partly from the royal treasury and partly raised by voluntary contributions among his countrymen, to create a fund out of which to make suitable provision for maintaining the regular worship of God in Jerusalem (Ezr 7:16, 17). Thirdly, the Persian officers in Syria were commanded to afford him every assistance by gifts of money within a certain specified limit, in carrying out the objects of his patriotic mission (Ezr 7:21).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ezra/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">His seven counsellors; </span> his chief nobles and officers of state, of whom see also <span class="bld"><a href="/esther/1-10.htm" title="On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains that served in the presence of Ahasuerus the king,">Esther 1:10</a>,14</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">To inquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem, </span> i.e. to make inquiry into all abuses and deviations from your law, and to redress them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Which is in thine hand; </span> which is now and always in thy hand, being the matter of thy daily study and exercise; which thou now carriest along with thee, the interpretation whereof belongeth unto thee. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/ezra/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Forasmuch as thou art sent of the king, and of his seven counsellors,....

The object of the enquiry is not defined except by the clause ‘according to the law of thy God’; from which we must conclude that the moral and religious condition of the Jews at Jerusalem having occasioned anxiety to the Jews at Babylon, Ezra, who in some way enjoyed the favour of the court, obtained permission to enquire generally into the position.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Judah and Jerusalem</span>] Cf. <a href="/ezra/5-1.htm" title="Then the prophets, Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophesied to the Jews that were in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel, even to them.">Ezra 5:1</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">according to the law</span>] Literally ‘with, or, through the law’.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">which</span> is <span class="ital">in thine hand</span>] Not a book in Ezra’s private possession, but the law of the Israelite people, in which Ezra was reputed to be the best instructed of his day.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezra/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - Ezra received his commission from the king, and from his <span class="cmt_word">seven</span> <span class="cmt_word">counsellors</span>, who thus seem to occupy an important position in the Persian state. They are commonly identified with the "seven princes of Persia and Media," mentioned in Esther (<a href="/esther/1-14.htm">Esther 1:14</a>), "which saw the king's face," and "sate first in the kingdom." A conjecture, which, though not unreasonable, cannot be said to be substantiated, connects the "seven counsellors" with the seven great Persian septs, or families, which had privileges beyond the rest, and among them the right of unrestricted access to the royal presence ('Herod.,' 3:84). The commission which Ezra received is described in this verse as one <span class="cmt_word">to inquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem;</span> but the subject-matter of the inquiry is not mentioned. He can scarcely have been sent to make inquiry whether the law of Moses was observed or no, since that was certainly not a matter with which the Persian government would concern itself. Probably he was to inquire generally into the material prosperity of the province, and to report thereon. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ezra/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>With Ezra went up a number of Israelites, priests, and Levites. &#1502;&#1503; partitive: a part of the whole. That they went up with Ezra appears from the context, and is expressly stated both in the royal edict (<a href="/ezra/7-13.htm">Ezra 7:13</a>) and in the further description of the expedition (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/7-28.htm">Ezra 7:28</a>, <a href="/ezra/8-1.htm">Ezra 8:1</a>). They went up in the seventh year of Artaxerxes, and reached Jerusalem in the fifth month of that year. - In <a href="/ezra/7-8.htm">Ezra 7:8</a> Ezra is again, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/7-6.htm">Ezra 7:6</a>, the subject of the sentence; the intervening seventh verse being really only in apposition with <a href="/ezra/7-6.htm">Ezra 7:6</a>. - In <a href="/ezra/7-9.htm">Ezra 7:9</a> the time occupied by the journey is more precisely defined; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; is explanatory. Namely, on the first day of the first month, he had appointed the journey from Babylon, etc. The Keri &#1497;&#1505;&#1491; &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; can only mean, ipsum erat fundamentum profectionis, as J. H. Mich. after R. Sal. explains it, for &#1497;&#1505;&#1491; is pointed as the construct state. The departure of the expedition from the place of meeting occurred, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/8-31.htm">Ezra 8:31</a>, on the twelfth day of the first month. Since, however, they encamped three days there, making the final preparations for their journey, eleven days might easily elapse between the period when the whole caravan had assembled, and the day of actual departure. The Keri offers no appropriate signification; for since &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; can only be taken for the subject, and &#1492;&#1501; &#1497;&#1505;&#1491; for the predicate, the sentence would contain an anacoluthon. To translate &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; by ipsum cannot be justified by the usages of the language, for there is no such emphasis on &#1497;&#1505;&#1491; as to cause &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; to be regarded as an emphatic reference to the following noun. &#1497;&#1505;&#1491; must be pointed &#1497;&#1505;&#1491; or &#1497;&#1505;&#1468;&#1491;, as the third pers. perf. Kal or Piel, meaning to arrange, to appoint, and &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; referred to Ezra.
