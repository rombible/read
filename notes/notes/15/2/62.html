But by this worldly ambition he forfeited the dignity and advantages of the priesthood.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ezra/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The Jews were generally very exact and careful in their genealogies, partly from their own choice and interest, that they might preserve the distinctions of the several tribes and families, which was necessary both to make out their claims or titles to offices or inheritances, which might belong to them by death, or otherwise, as here we see, and to govern themselves thereby in the matter of marriages, and some other things wherein the practice of some laws required the knowledge of these things; and partly by the special providence of God, that so it might be certainly known of what tribe and family the Messiah was born. For as they took care of all their families, so doubtless they took a more punctual and singular care about the royal family, upon which all their hopes depended. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/ezra/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>These sought their register among those that were reckoned by genealogy,....

Compare ‘the writing (mrg. ‘register’) of the house of Israel’ in <a href="/ezekiel/13-9.htm" title="And my hand shall be on the prophets that see vanity, and that divine lies: they shall not be in the assembly of my people, neither shall they be written in the writing of the house of Israel, neither shall they enter into the land of Israel; and you shall know that I am the Lord GOD.">Ezekiel 13:9</a>, where the same word is used in the original.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">therefore were they, as polluted, put from the priesthood</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">therefore were they deemed polluted and put from the priesthood.</span> The margin <span class="ital">Heb. ‘they were polluted from the priesthood’</span> gives the literal, rendering. To be declared polluted was equivalent to being excluded from any active part in the office and administration of the priesthood. They were to be accounted ‘polluted’, until their claim could be established.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The importance attached to the genealogical accuracy of the claims preferred to the priesthood is not only a symptom of the legal spirit which animated the Jews of the Return. It goes back to the abolition of the High Places firstly by Hezekiah and afterwards by Josiah, in consequence of which a sharp distinction was drawn between those who had ministered at the High Places and those who were engaged in the Temple worship at Jerusalem. This point is illustrated by the writings of Ezekiel, himself a priest, who writing during the Captivity distinguishes between ‘the priests the Levites that be of the seed of Zadok’ (<a href="/ezekiel/43-19.htm" title="And you shall give to the priests the Levites that be of the seed of Zadok, which approach to me, to minister to me, said the Lord GOD, a young bullock for a sin offering.">Ezekiel 43:19</a>; cf. <a href="/ezekiel/40-46.htm" title="And the chamber whose prospect is toward the north is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the altar: these are the sons of Zadok among the sons of Levi, which come near to the LORD to minister to him.">Ezekiel 40:46</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/44-14.htm" title="But I will make them keepers of the charge of the house, for all the service thereof, and for all that shall be done therein.">Ezekiel 44:14</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/48-11.htm" title="It shall be for the priests that are sanctified of the sons of Zadok; which have kept my charge, which went not astray when the children of Israel went astray, as the Levites went astray.">Ezekiel 48:11</a>) and the ‘Levites that went astray’ (<a href="/ezekiel/44-10.htm" title="And the Levites that are gone away far from me, when Israel went astray, which went astray away from me after their idols; they shall even bear their iniquity.">Ezekiel 44:10</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/44-13.htm" title="And they shall not come near to me, to do the office of a priest to me, nor to come near to any of my holy things, in the most holy place: but they shall bear their shame, and their abominations which they have committed.">Ezekiel 44:13</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/44-15.htm" title="But the priests the Levites, the sons of Zadok, that kept the charge of my sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from me, they shall come near to me to minister to me, and they shall stand before me to offer to me the fat and the blood, said the Lord GOD:">Ezekiel 44:15</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/48-11.htm" title="It shall be for the priests that are sanctified of the sons of Zadok; which have kept my charge, which went not astray when the children of Israel went astray, as the Levites went astray.">Ezekiel 48:11</a>).<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ezra/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Nethinim, i.e., temple-bondsmen, and the servants of Solomon, are reckoned together, thirty-five families of Nethinim and ten of the servants of Solomon being specified. The sum-total of these amounting only to 392, each family could only have averaged from eight to nine individuals. The sons of Akkub, Hagab and Asnah (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/2-45.htm">Ezra 2:45</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/2-46.htm">Ezra 2:46</a>, and <a href="/ezra/2-50.htm">Ezra 2:50</a>), are omitted in Nehemiah; the name Shalmai (<a href="/ezra/2-46.htm">Ezra 2:46</a>) is in <a href="/nehemiah/7-48.htm">Nehemiah 7:48</a> written Salmai; and for &#1504;&#1508;&#1497;&#1505;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/2-50.htm">Ezra 2:50</a>, <a href="/nehemiah/7-52.htm">Nehemiah 7:52</a> has &#1504;&#1508;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1505;&#1497;&#1501;, a form combined from &#1504;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1497;&#1501; and &#1504;&#1508;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;. All other variations relate only to differences of form. Because Ziha (&#1510;&#1497;&#1492;&#1488;, <a href="/ezra/2-43.htm">Ezra 2:43</a>) again occurs in <a href="/nehemiah/11-21.htm">Nehemiah 11:21</a> as one of the chiefs of the Nethinim, and the names following seem to stand in the same series with it, Bertheau insists on regarding these names as those of divisions. This cannot, however, be correct; for Ziha is in <a href="/nehemiah/11-21.htm">Nehemiah 11:21</a> the name of an individual, and in the present list also the proper names are those of individuals, and only the sons of Ziha, Hasupha, etc., can be called families or divisions. Plural words alone, Mehunim and Nephisim, are names of races or nations; hence the sons of the Mehunim signify individuals belonging to the Mehunim, who, perhaps, after the victory of King Uzziah over that people, were as prisoners of war made vassals for the service of the sanctuary. So likewise may the sons of the Nephisim have been prisoners of war of the Ishmaelite race &#1504;&#1508;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;. Most of the families here named may, however, have been descendants of the Gibeonites (<a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/9-21.htm">Joshua 9:21</a>, <a href="/joshua/9-27.htm">Joshua 9:27</a>). The servants of Solomon must not be identified with the Canaanite bond-servants mentioned <a href="/1_kings/9-20.htm">1 Kings 9:20</a>., <a href="/2_chronicles/8-7.htm">2 Chronicles 8:7</a>., but were probably prisoners of war of some other nation, whom Solomon sentenced to perform, as bondsmen, similar services to those imposed upon the Gibeonites. The sons of these servants are again mentioned in <a href="/nehemiah/11-3.htm">Nehemiah 11:3</a>. In other passages they are comprised under the general term Nethinim, with whom they are here computed. Among the names, that of &#1492;&#1510;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; &#1508;&#1468;&#1499;&#1512;&#1514; (<a href="/ezra/2-57.htm">Ezra 2:57</a>), i.e., catcher of gazelles, is a singular one; the last name, &#1488;&#1502;&#1497;, is in <a href="/nehemiah/7-59.htm">Nehemiah 7:59</a> &#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503;. </body></html>
