Zerubbabel was in the province of Babylon, and to him those captives joined themselves who lived nearest in the same province. This is the reason why those of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin returned first, though a liberty of returning was granted to all the tribes. Another reason is, because the rebuilding of the temple principally concerned them, as Jerusalem was within their dominion. — Houbigant. <span class="ital">That went out of captivity — </span>By the words <span class="ital">captivity </span>and <span class="ital">captives, </span>when applied to the Jews being carried to Babylon, we are not to understand that they were made slaves to private persons, and bought and sold from one to another, as captives generally were: for they seem to have been transported to Babylon as a colony, to serve the king only. And we do not find that they ever became the property of private persons in Babylon, but lived there free; only subject, as is probable, to some services for the king. Otherwise Cyrus must have redeemed them from the masters, whose property they were, or at least have made a proclamation that every one should let them go free; of neither of which is any mention made. And besides this, when liberty was given to all, of returning to their own land, we find that but few, comparatively speaking, accepted of it, which would scarce have been the case had they been slaves to private persons. <span class="ital">Every one unto his city — </span>Either those cities and towns which had belonged to their several ancestors; or rather, those which were now allotted to them, and from this time possessed by them.

The phrase is perhaps an indication of the register having been transcribed at Babylon.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">out of the captivity,</span> of <span class="ital">those which had been carried away</span>] The comma in the A.V. tends to confuse the meaning. The R.V. better, <span class="bld">out of the captivity of those which had been carried away</span>. The English fails to give the sense of the passage. The words ‘those which had been carried away’ translate the one Hebrew word rendered in chap. <a href="/ezra/1-11.htm" title="All the vessels of gold and of silver were five thousand and four hundred. All these did Sheshbazzar bring up with them of the captivity that were brought up from Babylon to Jerusalem.">Ezra 1:11</a> and elsewhere ‘the captivity’ (hag-gôlah). This was the technical abstract noun used to designate the Jews that had been carried away into foreign lands. The words here used are more nearly reproduced in the Greek version <span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ τῆς αἰχμαλωσίας τῆς ἀποικίας</span>. ‘From the captivity of the Gôlah’ means therefore ‘out of the condition and scene of captivity which was the lot of ‘the deportation’, i.e. of those who had been forcibly removed from their homes’. Cf. <a href="/ezra/1-11.htm" title="All the vessels of gold and of silver were five thousand and four hundred. All these did Sheshbazzar bring up with them of the captivity that were brought up from Babylon to Jerusalem.">Ezra 1:11</a>, <a href="/ezra/6-20.htm" title="For the priests and the Levites were purified together, all of them were pure, and killed the passover for all the children of the captivity, and for their brothers the priests, and for themselves.">Ezra 6:20</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Nebuchadnezzar</span>] R.V. margin, ‘Heb. <span class="ital">Nebuchadnezzor</span>’. This spelling represents the preferable reading of the original in this verse. It again indicates the different origin of this section from chap. <a href="/ezra/1-7.htm" title="Also Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of the LORD, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of Jerusalem, and had put them in the house of his gods;">Ezra 1:7</a>, where the Hebrew has ‘Nebuchadnezzar’ without any variant spelling. ‘Nebuchadnezzor’ attempts more nearly to reproduce the final syllable of the Assyrian ‘Nabû-kudur-uṣur’ i.e. ‘Nebo, defend the crown’. He is called ‘Nebuchadrezzar’ in several places. Once in <a href="/jeremiah/49-28.htm" title="Concerning Kedar, and concerning the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon shall smite, thus said the LORD; Arise you, go up to Kedar, and spoil the men of the east.">Jeremiah 49:28</a> (C’thib) ‘Nebuchadrezzor’.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The great king of Babylon reigned 43 years (605–562). The two chief ‘deportations’ took place (1) in 598, when Nebuchadnezzar carried away king Jehoiachin and all the principal inhabitants of Jerusalem; (2) in 587–6, when the city was destroyed.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">every one unto his city</span>] It is impossible to take these words as literally applicable to the year of the Return. The Jews on their return to their own land at first only occupied Jerusalem and the country immediately adjacent. The work of settling into their own cities was the work of years. But the process was complete at the time when this heading was attached to the register of names. The writer summarizes the movement, which in his own time was long past, cf. <a href="/ezra/2-70.htm" title="So the priests, and the Levites, and some of the people, and the singers, and the porters, and the Nethinims, dwelled in their cities, and all Israel in their cities.">Ezra 2:70</a>, <a href="/ezra/3-1.htm" title="And when the seventh month was come, and the children of Israel were in the cities, the people gathered themselves together as one man to Jerusalem.">Ezra 3:1</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezra/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">These are the children of the province.</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of Judaea, which was a <span class="accented">province</span> of Persia, distinguished here from Babylon, which was one of the capitals - a mode of speech indicating the foreign standpoint of Ezra. <span class="cmt_word">Unto Jerusalem and Judah,</span> <span class="cmt_word">every one unto his city.</span> Jerusalem was not the only site occupied by the people on their return.
