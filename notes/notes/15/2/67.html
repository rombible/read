Seek first the kingdom of God, his favour and his glory, then will all other things be added unto them. Their offerings were nothing, compared with the offerings of the princes in David's time; yet, being according to their ability, were as acceptable to God. The Lord will carry us through all undertakings entered on according to his will, with an aim to his glory, and dependence on his assistance. Those who, at the call of the gospel, renounce sin and return to the Lord, shall be guarded and guided through all perils of the way, and arrive safely at the mansions provided in the holy city of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ezra/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The sum total is given without any variation by Ezra, by Nehemiah (see the marginal reference), and by Esdras (1 Esdras 5:41), who adds, that in this reckoning only those of twelve years of age and upward were counted.<p>It is curious that the total 42,360, is so greatly in excess of the items. Ezra's items make the number 29,818; Nehemiah's 31,089, Esdras, 33,950.

The whole congregation together was forty and two thousand three hundred and threescore&#8212;This gross amount is twelve thousand more than the particular numbers given in the catalogue, when added together, come to. Reckoning up the smaller numbers, we shall find that they amount to 29,818 in this chapter, and to 31,089 in the parallel chapter of Nehemiah [see Ne 7:66-69]. Ezra also mentions four hundred ninety-four persons omitted by Nehemiah, and Nehemiah mentions 1765 not noticed by Ezra. If, therefore, Ezra's surplus be added to the sum in Nehemiah, and Nehemiah's surplus to the number in Ezra, they will both become 31,583. Subtracting this from 42,360, there will be a deficiency of 10,777. These are omitted because they did not belong to Judah and Benjamin, or to the priests, but to the other tribes. The servants and singers, male and female, are reckoned separately (Ezr 2:65), so that putting all these items together, the number of all who went with Zerubbabel amounted to fifty thousand, with eight thousand beasts of burden [Alting, quoted in Davidson's Hermeneutics].<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ezra/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/ezra/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>So that the far greatest part of them must walk on foot, since these can be thought to be little more than sufficient to carry their goods or baggage; some copies of the Vulgate Latin read six hundred and thirty six horses (c). <p>(c) Ed. of Sixtus V. and the Lovain in James's Contrariety of Popish Bibles, p. 295. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/ezra/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Their camels, four hundred thirty and five; their asses, six thousand seven hundred and twenty.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/ezra/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">67</span>. <span class="ital">camels</span>] The camel is mentioned in the O.T. chiefly as the beast of burden of nomad families and races, e.g. Ishmaelites (<a href="/genesis/37-25.htm" title="And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead with their camels bearing spices and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt.">Genesis 37:25</a>), Midianites and Amalekites (<a href="/judges/6-5.htm" title="For they came up with their cattle and their tents, and they came as grasshoppers for multitude; for both they and their camels were without number: and they entered into the land to destroy it.">Jdg 6:5</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/30-17.htm" title="And David smote them from the twilight even to the evening of the next day: and there escaped not a man of them, save four hundred young men, which rode on camels, and fled.">1 Samuel 30:17</a>).

The ass was the commonest best of burden. Unlike the horse, mule and camel, it seems from the earliest times to have been bred in Palestine. Its endurance for a long journey is greater than that of the horse. But it is not so serviceable for work in waterless regions as the mule or the camel. Asses are mentioned along with camels and horsemen in Isaiah’s prophecy of the fall of Babylon (<a href="/isaiah/21-7.htm" title="And he saw a chariot with a couple of horsemen, a chariot of asses, and a chariot of camels; and he listened diligently with much heed:">Isaiah 21:7</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>These four beasts of burden are mentioned in the same order in <a href="/zechariah/14-15.htm" title="And so shall be the plague of the horse, of the mule, of the camel, and of the ass, and of all the beasts that shall be in these tents, as this plague.">Zechariah 14:15</a>.

It has been customary among the pious of all ages and countries to make thank-offerings to the Almighty on the accomplishment of any important or dangerous work. The long journey of the exiles from Babylonia to Jerusalem involved considerable risk (see <a href="/ezra/8-22.htm">Ezra 8:22, 31</a>), and its successful termination naturally called forth their gratitude. The character of the offerings made is indicative of the fact, otherwise probable, that the exiles had turned all that they possessed into money, and had brought to Jerusalem a considerable amount of coin. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ezra/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Priests who could not prove themselves members of the priesthood. Comp. <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-63.htm">Nehemiah 7:63-65</a>. - Three such families are named: the sons of Habaiah, the sons of Hakkoz, the sons of Barzillai. These could not discover their family registers, and were excluded from the exercise of priestly functions. Of these three names, that of Hakkoz occurs as the seventh order of priests; but the names alone did not suffice to prove their priesthood, this being also borne by other persons. Comp. <a href="/nehemiah/3-4.htm">Nehemiah 3:4</a>. The sons of Barzillai were the descendants of a priest who had married a daughter, probably an heiress (Num), of Barzillai the Gileadite, so well known in the history of David (<a href="/2_samuel/17-27.htm">2 Samuel 17:27</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-32.htm">2 Samuel 19:32-39</a>; <a href="/1_kings/2-7.htm">1 Kings 2:7</a>), and had taken her name for the sake of taking possession of her inheritance (the suffix &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1501; refers to &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;; see on <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/27-1.htm">Numbers 27:1-11</a>). That by contracting this marriage he had not renounced for himself and his descendants his priestly privileges, is evident from the fact, that when his posterity returned from captivity, they laid claim to these privileges. The assumption, however, of the name of Barzillai might have cast such a doubt upon their priestly origin as to make it necessary that this should be proved from the genealogical registers, and a search in these did not lead to the desired discovery. &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1489;&#1501; is their &#1505;&#1508;&#1512; &#1497;&#1495;&#1513;&#1474;, <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-5.htm">Nehemiah 7:5</a>, the book or record in which their genealogy was registered.
