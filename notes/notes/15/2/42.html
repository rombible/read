The priests&#8212;Each of their families was ranged under its prince or head, like those of the other tribes. It will be remembered that the whole body was divided into twenty-four courses, one of which, in rotation, discharged the sacerdotal duties every week, and each division was called after the name of its first prince or chief. It appears from this passage that only four of the courses of the priests returned from the Babylonish captivity; but these four courses were afterwards, as the families increased, divided into twenty-four, which were distinguished by the names of the original courses appointed by David [1Ch 23:6-13]. Hence we find the course of Abijah or Abia (1Ch 24:10) subsisting at the commencement of the Christian era (Lu 1:5).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ezra/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/ezra/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>The Levites,....

The smallness of this and the two preceding numbers is remarkable. While the returning priests numbered 4289, the returning Levites of all classes were no more than 341 (350, Nehemiah). It would seem as if some jealousy of the priests, like that which animated Korah and his followers (<a href="/numbers/16-1.htm">Numbers 16:1-10</a>), must have grown up during the captivity (comp. below, <a href="/ezra/8-15.htm">Ezra 8:15</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ezra/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The list of the priests is identical, both in names and numbers, with that of <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-39.htm">Nehemiah 7:39-42</a>. These are:<p>The sons of Jedaiah, of the house of Jeshua 973  The sons of Immer 1052  The sons of Pashur 1247  The sons of Harim 1017  Total 4289  <p>Jedaiah is the head of the second order of priests in <a href="/1_chronicles/24-7.htm">1 Chronicles 24:7</a>. If, then, Jedaiah here represents this order, the words "of the house of Jeshua" must not be applied to Jeshua the high priest; the second order belonging in all probability to the line of Ithamar, and the high-priestly race, on the contrary, to that of Eleazar. We also meet the name Jeshua in other priestly families, e.g., as the name of the ninth order of priests in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24-11.htm">1 Chronicles 24:11</a>, so that it may be the old name of another priestly house. Since, however, it is unlikely that no priest of the order from which the high priest descended should return, the view that by Joshua the high priest is intended, and that the sons of Jedaiah were a portion of the house to which Joshua the high priest belonged, is the more probable one. In this case Jedaiah is not the name of the second order of priests, but of the head of a family of the high-priestly race. Immer is the name of the sixteenth order of priests, <a href="/1_chronicles/24-14.htm">1 Chronicles 24:14</a>. Pashur does not occur among the orders of priests in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24.htm">1 Chronicles 24</a>; but we find the name, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-12.htm">1 Chronicles 9:12</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-12.htm">Nehemiah 11:12</a>, among the ancestors of Adaiah, a priest of the order of Malchijah; the Pashur of <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/20.htm">Jeremiah 20</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-1.htm">Jeremiah 21:1-14</a> being, on the contrary, called the son of Immer, i.e., a member of the order of Immer. Hence Bertheau considers Pashur to have been the name of a priestly race, which first became extensive, and took the place of an older and perhaps extinct order, after the time of David. Gershom of the sons of Phinehas, and Daniel of the sons of Ithamar, are said, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/8-2.htm">Daniel 8:2</a>, to have gone up to Jerusalem with Ezra, while the order to which they belonged is not specified. Among the priests who had married strange wives (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/10-18.htm">Ezra 10:18-22</a>) are named, sons of Jeshua, Immer, Harim, Pashur; whence it has been inferred "that, till the time of Ezra, only the four divisions of priests here enumerated had the charge of divine worship in the new congregation" (Bertheau). On the relation of the names in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/2-36.htm">Ezra 2:36-39</a> to those in <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/10-3.htm">Nehemiah 10:3-9</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-1.htm">Nehemiah 12:1-22</a>, see remarks on these passages. </body></html>
