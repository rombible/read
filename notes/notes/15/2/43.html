It will be remembered that the whole body was divided into twenty-four courses, one of which, in rotation, discharged the sacerdotal duties every week, and each division was called after the name of its first prince or chief. It appears from this passage that only four of the courses of the priests returned from the Babylonish captivity; but these four courses were afterwards, as the families increased, divided into twenty-four, which were distinguished by the names of the original courses appointed by David [1Ch 23:6-13].

From these passages it is evident that the Nethinim were a class subordinate to the Levites but ranking before ‘the servants of Solomon’ (<a href="/ezra/2-55.htm" title="The children of Solomon's servants: the children of Sotai, the children of Sophereth, the children of Peruda,">Ezra 2:55</a>) in the services of the Temple. Their origin is hid in great obscurity. The name denotes ‘given’. Jewish tradition identified them mainly with the Gibeonites, who had been assigned by Joshua to the Levites to assist them in the discharge of the more menial tasks (<a href="/context/joshua/9-3.htm" title="And when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and to Ai,...">Joshua 9:3-27</a>). Their numbers were also, according to this supposition, increased by the captives taken in war, of whom a certain proportion were given over to the priests and Levites as their share in the booty of a campaign (<a href="/numbers/31-28.htm" title="And levy a tribute to the Lord of the men of war which went out to battle: one soul of five hundred, both of the persons, and of the beeves, and of the asses, and of the sheep:">Numbers 31:28</a> &c.). Thus in <a href="/ezra/8-20.htm" title="Also of the Nethinims, whom David and the princes had appointed for the service of the Levites, two hundred and twenty Nethinims: all of them were expressed by name.">Ezra 8:20</a> we find a mention of certain of this class ‘whom David and the princes had appointed (lit. ‘given’) for the service of the Levites’.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The later Jewish tradition of the Talmud spoke of the Nethinim with great contempt and forbade intermarriage between them and the Jews. It is not improbable that these expressions were employed long after this distinctive class had been lost to view, and merely reflected the tradition which ascribed their origin to the Gibeonites and the Canaanites who fell under the special ban of the Law (<a href="/context/exodus/34-12.htm" title="Take heed to yourself, lest you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land where you go, lest it be for a snare in the middle of you:...">Exodus 34:12-16</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/7-1.htm" title="When the LORD your God shall bring you into the land where you go to possess it, and has cast out many nations before you, the Hittites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, seven nations greater and mightier than you;">Deuteronomy 7:1</a> &c.).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>A recent theory, coupling the strong terms of Jewish hatred with the numerous feminine terminations in <span class="ital">-a</span> and <span class="ital">-ah</span> to be found in the genealogy of the Nethinim, supposes them to be the descendants of those who during the monarchy had led infamous lives in the precincts and vicinity of the Temple as devotees of Astarte and of Ashera (see <span class="ital">Babyl. and Orient. Record</span>, Feb., March 1888). But even if it were granted that the very odium of their origin would thus account for the mystery in which it is veiled, it does not seem probable that the strict notions which prevailed at the time of the Return would have admitted such a class to participate in the ministrations, however lowly, of the Temple.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The peculiar termination of the names derives a natural explanation from their foreign extraction.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezra/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 43.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Nethiaims</span>. See note on 1 Chronicles 9:2. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ezra/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The list of the priests is identical, both in names and numbers, with that of <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-39.htm">Nehemiah 7:39-42</a>. These are:<p>The sons of Jedaiah, of the house of Jeshua 973  The sons of Immer 1052  The sons of Pashur 1247  The sons of Harim 1017  Total 4289  <p>Jedaiah is the head of the second order of priests in <a href="/1_chronicles/24-7.htm">1 Chronicles 24:7</a>. If, then, Jedaiah here represents this order, the words "of the house of Jeshua" must not be applied to Jeshua the high priest; the second order belonging in all probability to the line of Ithamar, and the high-priestly race, on the contrary, to that of Eleazar. We also meet the name Jeshua in other priestly families, e.g., as the name of the ninth order of priests in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24-11.htm">1 Chronicles 24:11</a>, so that it may be the old name of another priestly house. Since, however, it is unlikely that no priest of the order from which the high priest descended should return, the view that by Joshua the high priest is intended, and that the sons of Jedaiah were a portion of the house to which Joshua the high priest belonged, is the more probable one. In this case Jedaiah is not the name of the second order of priests, but of the head of a family of the high-priestly race. Immer is the name of the sixteenth order of priests, <a href="/1_chronicles/24-14.htm">1 Chronicles 24:14</a>. Pashur does not occur among the orders of priests in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24.htm">1 Chronicles 24</a>; but we find the name, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-12.htm">1 Chronicles 9:12</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-12.htm">Nehemiah 11:12</a>, among the ancestors of Adaiah, a priest of the order of Malchijah; the Pashur of <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/20.htm">Jeremiah 20</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-1.htm">Jeremiah 21:1-14</a> being, on the contrary, called the son of Immer, i.e., a member of the order of Immer. Hence Bertheau considers Pashur to have been the name of a priestly race, which first became extensive, and took the place of an older and perhaps extinct order, after the time of David. Gershom of the sons of Phinehas, and Daniel of the sons of Ithamar, are said, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/8-2.htm">Daniel 8:2</a>, to have gone up to Jerusalem with Ezra, while the order to which they belonged is not specified. Among the priests who had married strange wives (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/10-18.htm">Ezra 10:18-22</a>) are named, sons of Jeshua, Immer, Harim, Pashur; whence it has been inferred "that, till the time of Ezra, only the four divisions of priests here enumerated had the charge of divine worship in the new congregation" (Bertheau). On the relation of the names in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/2-36.htm">Ezra 2:36-39</a> to those in <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/10-3.htm">Nehemiah 10:3-9</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-1.htm">Nehemiah 12:1-22</a>, see remarks on these passages. </body></html>
