We must suppose that the founder of this family had exercised rule over some portion of the Moabite territory. We learn from <a href="/1_chronicles/4-22.htm" title="And Jokim, and the men of Chozeba, and Joash, and Saraph, who had the dominion in Moab, and Jashubilehem. And these are ancient things.">1 Chronicles 4:22</a> that certain members of the tribe of Judah ‘had the dominion in Moab’. Probably this family belonged to the tribe of Judah. The word Pahath was commonly in use in Assyria, and is similar to the term for ‘governor’. Part of this family returned with Ezra (<a href="/ezra/8-4.htm" title="Of the sons of Pahathmoab; Elihoenai the son of Zerahiah, and with him two hundred males.">Ezra 8:4</a>): certain members of it are mentioned in <a href="/ezra/10-30.htm" title="And of the sons of Pahathmoab; Adna, and Chelal, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattaniah, Bezaleel, and Binnui, and Manasseh.">Ezra 10:30</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/3-11.htm" title="Malchijah the son of Harim, and Hashub the son of Pahathmoab, repaired the other piece, and the tower of the furnaces.">Nehemiah 3:11</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Jeshua</span> and <span class="ital">Joab</span>] In the original ‘Jeshua Joab’.

But only 30 + 1000 &#1488;&#1504;&#1512;&#1496;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, 29 &#1502;&#1495;&#1500;&#1508;&#1497;&#1501;, 30 + 410 covered goblets, and 1000 other vessels are enumerated, making together 2499. The same numbers are found in the lxx. Ancient interpreters reconciled the difference by the supposition that in the separate statements only the larger and more valuable vessels are specified, while in the sum-total the greater and lesser are reckoned together. This reconciliation of the discrepancy is, however, evidently arbitrary, and cannot be justified by a reference to <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-18.htm">2 Chronicles 36:18</a>, where the taking away of the greater and lesser vessels of the temple at the destruction of Jerusalem is spoken of. In <a href="/ezra/1-11.htm">Ezra 1:11</a> it is indisputably intended to give the sum-total according to the enumeration of the separate numbers. The difference between the two statements has certainly arisen from errors in the numbers, for the correction of which the means are indeed wanting. The error may be supposed to exist in the sum-total, where, instead of 5400, perhaps 2500 should be read, which sum may have been named in round numbers instead of 2499.<p>(Note: Ewald (Gesch. iv. p. 88) and Bertheau think they find in 1 Esdr. 2:12, 13, a basis for ascertaining the correct number. In this passage 1000 golden and 1000 silver &#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3b1;, 29 silver &#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3b9;&#836;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, 30 golden and 2410 silver &#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, and 1000 other vessels, are enumerated (1000 + 10000 + 29 + 30 + 2410 + 1000  equals  5469); while the total is said to be 5469. But 1000 golden &#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3b1; bear no proportion to 1000 silver, still less do 30 golden &#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; to 2410 silver. Hence Bertheau is of opinion that the more definite statement 30, of the Hebrew text, is to be regarded as original, instead of the first 1000; that, on the other hand, instead of the 30 golden &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;,    1000 originally stood in the text, making the total 5469. Ewald thinks that we must read 1030 instead of 1000 golden &#1488;&#1490;&#1512;&#1496;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; (&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3b1;), and make the total 5499. In opposition to these conjectures, we prefer abiding by the Hebrew text; for the numbers of 1 Esdras are evidently the result of an artificial, yet unskilful reconciliation of the discrepancy. It cannot be inferred, from the fact that Ezra subsequently, at his return to Jerusalem, brought with him 20 golden &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, that the number of 30 such &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; given in this passage is too small.)<p>&#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492; &#1492;&#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514; &#1506;&#1501;, at the bringing up of the carried away, i.e., when they were brought up from Babylon to Jerusalem. The infinitive Niphal &#1492;&#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514;, with a passive signification, occurs also <a href="/jeremiah/37-11.htm">Jeremiah 37:11</a>. </body></html>
