It is in reality the well-known Persian gold coin ‘daric’. The name has commonly been derived from the Darius who was said to have first had the piece coined. But this is far from certain. The word ‘daric’ more probably refers to the emblem on the coin, and is to be derived either from a Persian word meaning ‘a bow’, or from ‘dara’ = ‘a king’, cf. our ‘sovereign’. The obverse side of the coin has the figure of a crowned king, kneeling, holding in his right hand a sceptre or spear and in his left a bow; for the sake possibly of securing a good impression, the reverse of the coin was left rough.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The ‘daric’ is transliterated into Hebrew as ‘Adarcon’ in chap. <a href="/ezra/8-27.htm" title="Also twenty basins of gold, of a thousand drams; and two vessels of fine copper, precious as gold.">Ezra 8:27</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/29-7.htm" title="And gave for the service of the house of God of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand drams, and of silver ten thousand talents, and of brass eighteen thousand talents, and one hundred thousand talents of iron.">1 Chronicles 29:7</a> : but in this verse and in <a href="/context/nehemiah/7-70.htm" title="And some of the chief of the fathers gave to the work.

The priestly garments are briefly enumerated in <a href="/exodus/28-40.htm" title="And for Aaron's sons you shall make coats, and you shall make for them girdles, and bonnets shall you make for them, for glory and for beauty.">Exodus 28:40</a>; <a href="/exodus/39-27.htm" title="And they made coats of fine linen of woven work for Aaron, and for his sons,">Exodus 39:27</a>. They consisted of (1) a long coat or tunic, (2) a mitre or turban, (3) breeches or nether garments, (4) a girdle. The material was fine linen, and the colour white. These garments the priest appears to have laid aside and deposited in one of the chambers at the entrance of the inner court of the Temple, before passing into the people’s court.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezra/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 69.</span> - After their ability.

This was a gold coin, stamped with the figure of a Persian king, wearing his crown, and armed with a bow and arrow. According to the most exact computation, each such coin contained somewhat more pure gold than an English guinea, and was worth &pound;1 1s. 10.5d. of our money.

Thus the sum contributed in silver may be estimated at above &pound;20,000, and the entire contribution at nearly &pound;90,000. It must be noted, however, that Nehemiah's estimate (Nehemiah 7:71, 72) is less. <span class="cmt_word">One hundred priests' garments.</span> Nehemiah says ninety-seven (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> vers. 70, 72), whence we may conclude that Ezra uses a round number. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ezra/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Tirshatha, the secular governor of the community, i.e., as is obvious from a comparison of <a href="/nehemiah/7-65.htm">Nehemiah 7:65</a> with <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-70.htm">Nehemiah 7:70</a>, Zerubbabel, called <a href="/haggai/1-1.htm">Haggai 1:1</a> &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1492; &#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;. &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1488;, always used with the article, is undoubtedly the Persian designation of the governor or viceroy.

The meaning of the word is still matter of dispute. Some derive it from the Persian trs&#305;&#770;dn, to fear, and trs, fear  equals  the feared or respected one (Meier, Wurzelb. p. 714); others from Persian trs&#780;, acer, auster, the strict ruler; others, again (with Benfey, die Monatsnamen, p. 196), from the Zend. thvo&#770;restar (nom. thvo&#770;resta), i.e., praefectus, penes quem est imperium: comp. Gesenius, thes. p. 1521. The Tirshatha decided that they were not to eat of the most holy things till there should arise a priest with Urim and Thummim, i.e., to give a final decision by means of Urim and Thummim. &#1506;&#1502;&#1491;, according to the later usage of the language, is equivalent to &#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;, comp. <a href="/daniel/8-3.htm">Daniel 8:3</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/11-2.htm">Daniel 11:2</a>, and other places. The prohibition to eat of the most holy things (comp. on <a href="/leviticus/2-3.htm">Leviticus 2:3</a>) involved the prohibition to approach the most holy objects, e.g., the altar of burnt-offering (<a href="/exodus/29-37.htm">Exodus 29:37</a>; <a href="/exodus/30-10.htm">Exodus 30:10</a>), and to enter the most holy place, and thus excludes from specific priestly acts: without, however, denying a general inclusion among the priestly order, or abolishing a claim to the priestly revenues, so far as these were not directly connected with priestly functions. On Urim and Thummim, see on <a href="/exodus/28-30.htm">Exodus 28:30</a>. From the words, "till a priest shall arise," etc., it is evident that the then high priest was not in a position to entreat, and to pronounce, the divine decision by Urim and Thummim. The reason of this, however, need not be sought in the personality of Joshua (Ewald, Gesch. iv. 95), nor supposed to exist in such a fact as that he might not perhaps have been the eldest son of his father, and therefore not have had full right to the priesthood. This conjecture rests upon utterly erroneous notions of the Urim and Thummim, upon a subjectivistic view, which utterly evaporates the objective reality of the grace with which the high priest was in virtue of his office endowed. The obtainment of the divine decision by Urim and Thummim presupposes the gracious presence of Jahve in the midst of His people Israel. And this had been connected by the Lord Himself with the ark of the covenant, and with its cherubim-overshadowed mercy-seat, from above which He communed with His people (<a href="/exodus/25-22.htm">Exodus 25:22</a>). The high priest, bearing upon his breast the breastplate with the Urim and Thummim, was to appear before Jahve, and, bringing before Him the judgment of Israel, to entreat the divine decision (<a href="/exodus/28-30.htm">Exodus 28:30</a>; <a href="/numbers/27-21.htm">Numbers 27:21</a>). The ark of the covenant with the mercy-seat was thus, in virtue of the divine promise, the place of judgment, where the high priest was to inquire of the Lord by means of the Urim and Thummim. This ark, however, was no longer in existence, having been destroyed when Solomon's temple was burned by the Chaldeans. Those who returned with Zerubbabel were without the ark, and at first without a temple. In such a state of affairs the high priest could not appear before Jahve with the breastplate and the Urim and Thummim to entreat His decision. The books of Samuel, indeed, relate cases in which the divine will was consulted by Urim and Thummim, when the ark of the covenant was not present for the high priest to appear before (comp. <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-4.htm">1 Samuel 23:4</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-6.htm">1 Samuel 23:6</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-9.htm">1 Samuel 23:9</a>, etc., <a href="/1_samuel/14-18.htm">1 Samuel 14:18</a>); whence it appears that the external or local presence of the ark was not absolutely requisite for this purpose. Still these cases occurred at a time when the congregation of Israel as yet possessed the ark with the Lord's cherubim-covered mercy-seat, though this was temporarily separated from the holy of holies of the tabernacle. Matters were in a different state at the return from the captivity. Then, not only were they without either ark or temple, but the Lord had not as yet re-manifested His gracious presence in the congregation; and till this should take place, the high priest could not inquire of the Lord by Urim and Thummim. In the hope that with the restoration of the altar and temple the Lord would again vouchsafe His presence to the returned congregation, Zerubbabel expected that a high priest would arise with Urim and Thummim to pronounce a final decision with regard to those priests who could not prove their descent from Aaron's posterity. This expectation, however, was unfulfilled. Zerubbabel's temple remained unconsecrated by any visible token of Jahve's presence, as the place where His name should dwell. The ark of the covenant with the cherubim, and the Shechinah in the cloud over the cherubim, were wanting in the holy of holies of this temple. Hence, too, we find no single notice of any declaration of the divine will or the divine decision by Urim and Thummim in the period subsequent to the captivity; but have, on the contrary, the unanimous testimony of the Rabbis, that after the Babylonian exile God no longer manifested His will by Urim and Thummim, this kind of divine revelation being reckoned by them among the five things which were wanting in the second temple.
