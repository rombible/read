Merx, Archiv fr wissensch. Forschung des A. T., No. 3, p. 345, that by the addition &#1488;&#1495;&#1512; in Nehemiah, the Nebo in Judah is distinguished from the Nebo in Reuben.)<p>The names Bezai, Jorah, and Hashum (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/2-17.htm">Ezra 2:17-19</a>) are transposed in Nehemiah (<a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-22.htm">Nehemiah 7:22-24</a>) thus, Hashum, Bezai, and Harif; as are also Lod, etc., and Jericho, (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/2-33.htm">Ezra 2:33</a>, <a href="/ezra/2-34.htm">Ezra 2:34</a>) into Jericho and Lod, etc. (Nehemiah, vv. 36, 37). Lastly, the sons of Magbish (<a href="/ezra/2-30.htm">Ezra 2:30</a>) are omitted in Nehemiah; and the sons of Bethlehem and the men of Netophah (<a href="/ezra/2-21.htm">Ezra 2:21</a> and <a href="/ezra/2-22.htm">Ezra 2:22</a>) are in Nehemiah (<a href="/nehemiah/7-26.htm">Nehemiah 7:26</a>) reckoned together, and stated to be 188 instead of 123 + 56  equals  179. A glance at the names undoubtedly shows that those numbered 1-17 are names of races or houses: those from 18-27, and from 31-33, are as certainly names of towns; there, therefore, inhabitants of towns are named. This series is, however, interrupted by Nos. 28-30; Harim being undoubtedly, and Magbish very probably, names not of places, but of persons; while the equality of the number of the other, Elam 1254, with that of Elam (No. 6), seems somewhat strange. To this must be added, that Magbish is wanting both in Nehemiah and 2 Esdras, and the other Elam in 1 Esdras; while, in place of the sons of Harim 320, we have in 1 Esdr. 5:16, in a more appropriate position, &#x3c5;&#x3b9;&#788;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x391;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bc; 32. Hence Bertheau infers that Nos. 28 and 29, sons of Magbish and sons of Elam Acher (vv. 30 and 31), are spurious, and that Harim should be written &#x391;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bc;, and inserted higher up. The reasons for considering these three statements doubtful have certainly some weight; but considering the great untrustworthiness of the statements in the first book of Esdras, and the other differences in the three lists arising, as they evidently do, merely from clerical errors, we could not venture to call them decisive.<p>Of the names of houses or races (Nos. 1-17 and 30), we meet with many in other lists of the time of Ezra and Nehemiah;<p>(Note: In the list of those who went up with Ezra (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/8.htm">Ezra 8</a>), the sons of Parosh, Pahath-Moab, Adin, Elam, Shephatiah, Joab, Bebai, Azgad, Adonikam, Bigvai, and, according to the original text (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/8-8.htm">Ezra 8:8</a>, <a href="/ezra/8-10.htm">Ezra 8:10</a>), also the sons of Zattu and Bani. In the lists of those who had taken strange wives (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/10.htm">Ezra 10</a>) we meet with individuals of the sons of Parosh, Elam, Zattu, Bebai, Bani, Pahath-Moab, Harim, Hashum, and of the sons of Nebo. Finally, in the lists of the heads of the people in the time of Nehemiah (<a href="/nehemiah/10-15.htm">Nehemiah 10:15</a>.) appear the names of Parosh, Pahath-Moab, Elam, Zattu, Bani, Azgad, Bebai, Bigvai, Adin, Ater, Hashum, Bezai, Harif, Harim, Anathoth, together with others which do not occur in the list we are not treating of.)<p>whence we perceive, (1) that of many houses only a portion returned with Zerubbabel and Joshua, the remaining portion following with Ezra; (2) that heads of houses are entered not by their personal names, but by that of the house. The names, for the most part, descend undoubtedly from the time anterior to the captivity, although we do not meet with them in the historical books of that epoch, because those books give only the genealogies of those more important personages who make a figure in history. Besides this, the genealogies in Chronicles are very incomplete, enumerating for the most part only the families of the more ancient times. Most, if not all, of these races or houses must be regarded as former inhabitants of Jerusalem. Nor can the circumstance that the names given in the present list are not found in the lists of the inhabitants of Jerusalem (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9.htm">1 Chronicles 9</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/11.htm">Nehemiah 11</a>) be held as any valid objection; for in those lists only the heads of the great races of Judah and Benjamin are named, and not the houses which those races comprised. The names of cities, on the other hand (Nos. 18-33), are for the most part found in the older books of the Old Testament: Gibeon in <a href="/joshua/9-3.htm">Joshua 9:3</a>; Bethlehem in <a href="/ruth/1-2.htm">Ruth 1:2</a>; <a href="/micah/5-1.htm">Micah 5:1</a>; Netophah, <a href="/2_samuel/23-28.htm">2 Samuel 23:28</a> - see comm. on <a href="/1_chronicles/2-54.htm">1 Chronicles 2:54</a>; Anathoth in <a href="/joshua/21-18.htm">Joshua 21:18</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/1-1.htm">Jeremiah 1:1</a>; Kirjath-jearim, Chephirah, and Beeroth, as cities of the Gibeonites, in <a href="/joshua/9-17.htm">Joshua 9:17</a>; Ramah and Geba, which often occur in the histories of Samuel and Saul, also in <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/18-24.htm">Joshua 18:24-25</a>; Michmash in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-2.htm">1 Samuel 13:2</a>, <a href="/1_samuel/13-5.htm">1 Samuel 13:5</a>; <a href="/isaiah/10-28.htm">Isaiah 10:28</a>; Bethel and Ai in <a href="/joshua/7-2.htm">Joshua 7:2</a>; and Jericho in <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/5-13.htm">Joshua 5:13</a>, and elsewhere. All these places were situate in the neighbourhood of Jerusalem, and were probably taken possession of by former inhabitants or their children immediately after the return. Azmaveth or Beth-azmaveth (<a href="/nehemiah/7-28.htm">Nehemiah 7:28</a>) does not occur in the earlier history, nor is it mentioned out of this list, except in <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-29.htm">Nehemiah 12:29</a>, according to which it must be sought for in the neighbourhood of Geba. It has not, however, been as yet discovered; for the conjecture of Ritter, Erdk. xvi. p. 519, that it may be el-Hizme, near Anta, is unfounded. Nor can the position of Nebo be certainly determined, the mountain of that name (<a href="/numbers/32-3.htm">Numbers 32:3</a>) being out of the question. Nob or Nobe (<a href="/1_samuel/21-2.htm">1 Samuel 21:2</a>) has been thought to be this town. Its situation is suitable; and this view is supported by the fact that in <a href="/nehemiah/11-31.htm">Nehemiah 11:31</a>., Nob, and not Nebo, is mentioned, together with many of the places here named; in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/10-43.htm">Ezra 10:43</a>, however, the sons of Nebo are again specified. As far as situation is concerned, Nuba, or Beit-Nuba (Robinson's Biblical Researches, p. 189), may, as Bertheau thinks, correspond with this town. Magbish was by many older expositors regarded as the name of a place, but is certainly that of a person; and no place of such a name is known. The localities Lod, Hadid, and Ono (<a href="/ezra/2-33.htm">Ezra 2:33</a>) first occur in the later books of the Old Testament. On Lod and Ono, see comm. on <a href="/1_chronicles/8-12.htm">1 Chronicles 8:12</a>. &#1495;&#1491;&#1497;&#1491; is certainly &#x391;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#769; (1 Macc. 12:28, 13:13), not far from Lydda, where there is still a place called el-Hadithe, Arab. 'l-hd&#305;&#770;th (Robinson's Biblical Researches, p. 186). &#1505;&#1504;&#1488;&#1492;, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/2-35.htm">Ezra 2:35</a>, is identified by older expositors with &#x3a3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;, &#x3bd;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x39c;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;, which Jerome describes as terminus Judae, in septimo lapide Jerichus contra septentrionalem plagam (Onom. ed. Lars. et Parth. p. 332f.); in opposition to which, Robinson, in his above-cited work, identifies Magdal-Senna with a place called Mejdel, situate on the summit of a high hill about eighteen miles north of Jericho. The situation, however, of this town does not agree with the distance mentioned by Eusebius and Jerome, and the name Mejdel, i.e., tower, is not of itself sufficient to identify it with Magdal-Senna. The situation of the Senaah in question is not as yet determined; it must be sought for, however, at no great distance from Jericho. Of the towns mentioned in the present list, we find that the men of Jericho, Senaah, and Gibeon, as well as the inhabitants of Tekoa, Zanoah, Beth-haccerem, Mizpah, Beth-zur, and Keilah, assisted at the building of the walls of Jerusalem under Nehemiah (<a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-2.htm">Nehemiah 3:2-3</a>, <a href="/nehemiah/3-7.htm">Nehemiah 3:7</a>). A larger number of towns of Judah and Benjamin is specified in the list in <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-25.htm">Nehemiah 11:25-35</a>, whence we perceive that in process of time a greater multitude of Jews returned from captivity and settled in the land of their fathers. </body></html>
