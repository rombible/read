The word occurs only here, and is translated in the Septuagint &#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;; in 1 Esdr. 2:11, &#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3b1;. The Talmudic explanation of Aben Ezra, "vessels for collecting the blood of the sacrificed lambs," is derived from &#1488;&#1490;&#1512;, to collect, and &#1496;&#1500;&#1492;, a lamb, but is certainly untenable. &#1506;&#1490;&#1512;&#1496;&#1500; is probably connected with Arab. qart&#803;allah, the rabbinical &#1511;&#1512;&#1496;&#1497;&#1500;, the Syriac kart&#803;a&#772;la&#772;', the Greek &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; or &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, a basket (according to Suidas), &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; having no etymology in Greek; but can hardly be derived, as by Meier, hebr. Wurzelwrterbuch, p. 683, from the Syriac &#8219;rt&#803;l, nudavit, to make bare, the Arabic &#8219;art&#803;ala, to make empty, to hollow, with the sense of hollow basins. 2. &#1502;&#1495;&#1500;&#1508;&#1497;&#1501;   29. This word also occurs only here. The Sept. has &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1; (interpreting etymologically after &#1495;&#1500;&#1507;),   1 Esdr. &#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3b9;&#836;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, the Vulg. cultri, sacrificial knives, according to the rabbinical interpretation, which is based upon &#1495;&#1500;&#1507;, in the sense of to pierce, to cut through (<a href="/judges/5-26.htm">Judges 5:26</a>; <a href="/job/20-24.htm">Job 20:24</a>). This meaning is, however, certainly incorrect, being based linguistically upon a mere conjecture, and not even offering an appropriate sense, since we do not expect to find knives between vessels and dishes. Ewald (Gesch. iv. p. 88), from the analogy of &#1502;&#1495;&#1500;&#1508;&#1493;&#1514; (<a href="//biblehub.com/judges/16-13.htm">Judges 16:13</a>, <a href="/judges/16-19.htm">Judges 16:19</a>), plaits, supposes vessels ornamented with plaited or net work; and Bertheau, vessels bored after the manner of a grating for censing, closed fire-pans with holes and slits. All is, however, uncertain. 3.   &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, goblets (goblets with covers; comp. <a href="/1_chronicles/15-18.htm">1 Chronicles 15:18</a>) of gold, 30; and of silver, 410. The word &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; is obscure; connected with &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1507; &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497; &#1499;&#1468;&#1505; it can only mean goblets of a second order (comp. <a href="/1_chronicles/15-18.htm">1 Chronicles 15:18</a>). Such an addition appears, however, superfluous; the notion of a second order or class being already involved in their being of silver, when compared with the golden goblets. Hence Bertheau supposes &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; to be a numeral corrupted by a false reading; and the more so, because the sum-total given in <a href="/ezra/1-11.htm">Ezra 1:11</a> seems to require a larger number than 410. These reasons, however, are not insuperable. The notion of a second order of vessels need not lie in their being composed of a less valuable metal, but may also be used to define the sort of implement; and the difference between the separate numbers and the sum-total is not perfectly reconciled by altering &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; into &#1488;&#1500;&#1508;&#1497;&#1501;,     2000. 4. 1000 other vessels or implements. </body></html>
