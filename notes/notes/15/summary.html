Upon Zerubbabel’s return, the second temple was completed, and following Ezra’s arrival, a great revival occurs.<p class="spc"></p><p class="hdg"><B>Bottom Line Introduction</B><p class="spc"></p><p class="reg">TO GOD BE THE GLORY!

In Exodus God used Moses and Aaron to accomplish the deliverance. Here in Ezra he employed Zerubbabel and another Joshua to do the same thing. As there had been three previous trips into Babylonian bondage, there would now be three journeys back into Holy Land freedom.<p class="spc"></p><p class="capletter"><span class="cap">A.</span> The three trips into Babylon:<p class="spc"></p><p class="num"><span class="nm">1.</span> In the days of Daniel (606 B.C.)<p class="num"><span class="nm">2.</span> In the days of Ezekiel (597 B.C.)<p class="num"><span class="nm">3.</span> In the days of King Zedekiah (586 B.C.)<p class="spc"></p><p class="capletter"><span class="cap">B.</span> The three trips into freedom:<p class="spc"></p><p class="num"><span class="nm">1.</span> As led by Zerubbabel and Joshua (583 B.C.)<p class="num"><span class="nm">2.</span> As led by Ezra (456 B.C.)<p class="num"><span class="nm">3.</span> As led by Nehemiah (446 B.C.)<p class="spc"></p><p class="capletter"><span class="cap">C.</span> The former and final trips as described by the Psalmist: Psalm 137 records the sorrow of the former trips, while Psalm 126 describes the singing of the final trips<p class="spc"></p><p class="hdg"><B>Facts Regarding the Author of this Book</B><p class="spc"></p><p class="num"><span class="nm">1.</span> Who? <b>Ezra.</b> He was a gifted Bible teacher, priest and scribe (Ezra 7:1-6, 10) who led the second of three Jewish returns from Persia to Jerusalem (Ezra 7:27, 28).<p class="num"><span class="nm">2.</span> What?

Between chapters 6 and 7 a period of 60 years transpires. During this time three important world battles were fought (Salamis, Thermopylae, and Marathon), and two famous religious leaders died (Confucius and Buddha). However, scripture makes no mention of these great events. Why? The answer is clear—in the mind of God the return of his people to their homeland was more important.<p class="num"><span class="nm">3.</span> Ezra recorded the construction of the second temple (6:15), plus one of the strangest dedication services ever held (3:10-13).<p class="num"><span class="nm">4.</span> Ezra is the only Old Testament book to refer to the ministries of three writing prophets.
