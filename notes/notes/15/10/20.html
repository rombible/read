And when sin is repented of and forsaken, God will forgive it; but the blood of Christ, our Sin-offering, is the only atonement which takes away our guilt. No seeming repentance or amendment will benefit those who reject Him, for self-dependence proves them still unhumbled.

The delinquents of the priestly order bound themselves to do like the common Israelites (Ezr 10:25), and sought to expiate their sin by sacrificing a ram as a trespass offering.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ezra/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/ezra/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And they gave their hands that they would put away their wives,.... They proposed to do it, and actually did it: <p>and being guilty; of which they were fully convinced: <p>they offered a ram of the flock for their trespass; to make atonement for it, and thereby set an example to others to do the like. Aben Ezra observes, that we do not find that the trespass offering was a mulct to such who married strange wives, and conjectures, that it was the advice of the chief men to do it. From hence, to the end of <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/10-43.htm">Ezra 10:43</a>, is a list of the men that had married strange wives, and put them away; those in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/10-20.htm">Ezra 10:20</a>, were priests; in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/10-23.htm">Ezra 10:23</a>, Levites, and those of them who were singers or porters; the rest were Israelites: and it is a very common distinction, in rabbinical writers, to distinguish the Jews into priests, Levites, and Israelites; of these we know no more than their names; some of the heads of the families may be observed in <a href="/ezra/2-1.htm">Ezra 2:1</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/ezra/10.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And of the sons of Immer; Hanani, and Zebadiah.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezra/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 20-22.</span> - On the priestly families of <span class="cmt_word">Immer</span>, <span class="cmt_word">Harim</span>, and <span class="cmt_word">Pashur</span> see above, <a href="/ezra/2-37.htm">Ezra 2:37-39</a>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ezra/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Let then our rulers stand for the whole congregation, and let all who in all our cities have brought home strange wives come at appointed times, and with them the elders of each city, and the judges thereof, until the fierce wrath of our God be turned away from us, as long as this matter lasts." There were so many cases to deal with, that the rulers, as the judicial authorities, must decide in this matter; and those who in all the cities of the land had transgressed, were to appear before these authorities, and submit their individual cases to their jurisdiction. The choice of the verb &#1497;&#1506;&#1502;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;, to stand or set oneself to discharge some business, here therefore to give judgment, is occasioned by the preceding &#1500;&#1506;&#1502;&#1493;&#1491;. The whole community had assembled according to the proclamation, and was standing there for the purpose of bringing the matter to a close. This they were not, however, able to do, for the reasons stated <a href="/ezra/10-13.htm">Ezra 10:13</a>; hence the princes, as rulers of the community, are to remain for the discharge of the business. &#1500;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1511;&#1468;&#1492;&#1500; is not a genitive dependent on &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, and explanatory of the suffix of this word-our, viz., the whole congregation's, princes (Bertheau) - an unnatural and superfluous elucidation; for if the whole congregation say: our princes, it is self-evident that not the princes of a section or portion of the people, but of the whole congregation, must be intended. &#1500;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1511;&#1468;&#1492;&#1500; is the object of &#1497;&#1506;&#1502;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;: let them stand for the whole congregation (&#1500; &#1506;&#1502;&#1491; like &#1500; &#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;, <a href="/psalms/94-16.htm">Psalm 94:16</a>), not instead of, but for the good of the congregation, and transact its business. In our cities, i.e., including the capital, for there is here no contrast between Jerusalem and the other cities. The article to &#1492;&#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489; stands, as is often the case, for the relative &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, e.g., <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/10-17.htm">Ezra 10:17</a>, <a href="/ezra/8-25.htm">Ezra 8:25</a>. &#1502;&#1494;&#1502;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; &#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, appointed times, stated terms, used only here and in <a href="/nehemiah/10-35.htm">Nehemiah 10:35</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/13-31.htm">Nehemiah 13:31</a>. &#1494;&#1502;&#1468;&#1503; is a Chaldaistic expression. With the accused were to come the elders and judges of every city, to furnish the necessary explanations and evidence. &#1500;&#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489; &#1506;&#1491;, until the turning away of the fierceness of the wrath (&#1500; &#1506;&#1491; according to the later usage of the language instead of &#1506;&#1491; only, comp. Ewald, 315, a, not instead of &#1500; only, as Bertheau seeks, by incorrectly interpreted passages, to prove). The meaning is: until the fierce wrath of God concerning these marriages shall be turned away, by their dissolution and the dismissal of the strange women from the congregation. The last words, &#1492;&#1494;&#1468;&#1492; &#1500;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; &#1506;&#1491;, offer some difficulty. De Wette and Bertheau translate them: on account of this matter, which &#1500; &#1506;&#1491; can by no means signify. We regard &#1500; &#1506;&#1491;  equals  &#1506;&#1491; of the older language, in the sense of during, like <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/9-22.htm">2 Kings 9:22</a>, according to which the meaning is: as long as this thing lasts; but we connect these words, not, as J. H. Michaelis, with the immediately preceding clause: the wrath which is fierce during this matter (quae usque, i.e., constanter ardet), but take them as more exactly defining the leading idea of the verse: the princes are to stand and judge the guilty as long as this matter lasts, so that &#1492;&#1494;&#1468;&#1492; &#1500;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; &#1506;&#1491; is co-ordinate with &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1500;&#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489; &#1506;&#1491;. </body></html>
