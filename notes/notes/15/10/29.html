And when sin is repented of and forsaken, God will forgive it; but the blood of Christ, our Sin-offering, is the only atonement which takes away our guilt. No seeming repentance or amendment will benefit those who reject Him, for self-dependence proves them still unhumbled. All the names written in the book of life, are those of penitent sinners, not of self-righteous persons, who think they have no need of repentance.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ezra/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They gave their hands - i. e., "solemnly pledged themselves" (compare the marginal references).<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ezra/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19. they gave their hands&#8212;that is, came under a solemn engagement, which was usually ratified by pledging the right hand (Pr 6:1; Eze 17:18).

They proposed to do it, and actually did it: <p>and being guilty; of which they were fully convinced: <p>they offered a ram of the flock for their trespass; to make atonement for it, and thereby set an example to others to do the like. Aben Ezra observes, that we do not find that the trespass offering was a mulct to such who married strange wives, and conjectures, that it was the advice of the chief men to do it.
