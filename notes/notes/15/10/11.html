So rich is the mercy, and so plenteous the redemption of God, that there is hope for the vilest who hear the gospel, and are willing to accept of free salvation. When sinners mourn for their sins, and tremble at the word of God, there is hope that they will forsake them. To affect others with godly sorrow or love to God, we must ourselves be affected.

But as the weather was ungenial and the defaulters were too numerous to be passed in review at one time, it was resolved that a commission should be appointed to examine into the whole matter. These commissioners, assisted by the judges and elders of the respective cities, made a minute investigation into every case, and after three months' labor completely removed all traces of the abuse. Doubtless, an adequate provision was made for the repudiated wives and children, according to the means and circumstances of the husbands.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ezra/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Do his pleasure; </span> you have sinfully pleased yourselves, now please God by your obedience to his command. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/ezra/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Now therefore make confession to the Lord God of your fathers,....

Or, <span class="ital">give thanks</span>) <span class="ital">unto the Lord, the God of your fathers</span>. ‘Make confession’. Literally ‘give thanksgiving or praise’. The substantive is connected with the verb which in its reflexive form means, as in <a href="/ezra/10-1.htm" title="Now when Ezra had prayed, and when he had confessed, weeping and casting himself down before the house of God, there assembled to him out of Israel a very great congregation of men and women and children: for the people wept very sore.">Ezra 10:1</a>, ‘made confession’.

Or, <span class="ital">give praise</span>) unto him’. There, as in this passage, ‘make confession’ is a good paraphrase rather than a strict translation. ‘Praise’ was given to God by the utterance of confession. The penitent who renounced his sin and threw himself upon the mercies of God rendered that true praise of trust and love, from which ‘confession’ springs. Cf. <a href="/psalms/50-23.htm" title="Whoever offers praise glorifies me: and to him that orders his conversation aright will I show the salvation of God.">Psalm 50:23</a> ‘Whoso offereth the sacrifice of <span class="ital">thanksgiving</span> glorifieth me’.
