One would think this grievance altogether removed; yet we meet with it again, <a href="/nehemiah/13-22.htm" title="And I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify the sabbath day. Remember me, O my God, concerning this also, and spare me according to the greatness of your mercy.">Nehemiah 13:22</a>.

And when sin is repented of and forsaken, God will forgive it; but the blood of Christ, our Sin-offering, is the only atonement which takes away our guilt. No seeming repentance or amendment will benefit those who reject Him, for self-dependence proves them still unhumbled. All the names written in the book of life, are those of penitent sinners, not of self-righteous persons, who think they have no need of repentance.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ezra/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The guilty persons, it would seem, were 113 in number.

In all about one hundred and thirteen: <p>and some of them had wives by whom they had children; and yet they put them away, which made it the more difficult for them to do; and those that had none, it is thought to be a mark of God's displeasure at such marriages. No mention being made of the children being put away, as Shechaniah proposed, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/10-3.htm">Ezra 10:3</a>, it may be concluded they were not, but were taken care of, to be educated in the true religion, and entered proselytes at a proper time; and the rather, as Ezra gave no orders about their putting away, <a href="/ezra/10-11.htm">Ezra 10:11</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/ezra/10.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">All these had taken strange wives: and <i>some</i> of them had wives by whom they had <span class="cverse3">{n}</span> children.</span><p>(n) Who also were made illegitimate because the marriage was unlawful.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/ezra/10.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">44</span>. <span class="ital">All these had taken strange wives</span>] So also the R.V., a different phrase in the original from that rendered ‘had married strange women’. See on <a href="/ezra/9-2.htm" title="For they have taken of their daughters for themselves, and for their sons: so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the people of those lands: yes, the hand of the princes and rulers has been chief in this trespass.">Ezra 9:2</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and some of them had wives by</span> whom <span class="ital">they had children</span>] So R.V. Marg. Or, <span class="ital">some of the wives had borne children</span>. The clause in the original is beset with difficulties. Literally rendered it seems to be ‘And there were of them (masc.) wives, and they (masc.) begat children’. The LXX. renders freely ‘And they begat of them sons’ (<span class="greekheb">καὶ ἐγέννησαν ἐξ αὐτῶν υἱούς</span>) agreeing generally with the A.V. and R.V. text. The Vulgate has ‘And there were of them wives which had borne children’, agreeing with the margin of the R.V. This, it must be confessed, gives the best sense, although it does violence to the grammar in the matter of genders. The exact purpose of the clause is also a matter of uncertainty. (1) By some it is supposed that the clause is intended to illustrate the difficulties with which this general divorce was attended. The action was complicated by the question of the children. (2) Others think that it is added to show how thoroughly the commission was carried out. Mothers and their children were alike driven forth, in accordance with Shecaniah’s proposal (<a href="/ezra/10-3.htm" title="Now therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away all the wives, and such as are born of them, according to the counsel of my lord, and of those that tremble at the commandment of our God; and let it be done according to the law.">Ezra 10:3</a>) ‘Let us make a covenant with our God to put away all the wives and such as are born of them’. The probability that we are here confronted with another instance of textual corruption receives support from the parallel passage, <a href="//apocrypha.org/1_esdras/9-36.htm" title="All these had taken strange wives, and they put them away with their children.">1Es 9:36</a> ‘And they put them away along with their children’, which suggests the existence of a different original text.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezra/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 44.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And some of them had wives by whom they had children.</span> Rather, "And there were some among the wives who had given birth to children." The fact is implied above in the advice of Shechaniah (ver. 3), but is here alone distinctly asserted. No doubt it was more difficult to arrange the terms of the divorce where the marriage had been fruitful. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ezra/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Of Israel, as distinguished from priests and Levites, i.e., of the laity. Of these latter are given in all eighty-six names, belonging to ten races, vv. 25-43, who returned with Zerubbabel. See Nos. 1, 5, 6, 9, 8, 4, 30, 17, and 27 of the survey of these races. &#1497;&#1512;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; in <a href="/ezra/10-29.htm">Ezra 10:29</a> should, according to the Chethiv, be read &#1497;&#1512;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;. - The twofold naming of sons of Bani in this list (<a href="/ezra/10-29.htm">Ezra 10:29</a> and <a href="/ezra/10-34.htm">Ezra 10:34</a>) is strange, and Bani is evidently in one of these places a mistake for some other name. Bertheau supposes that Bigvai may have stood in the text in one of these places. The error undoubtedly lies in the second mention of Bani (<a href="/ezra/10-34.htm">Ezra 10:34</a>), and consists not merely in the wrong transcription of this one name. For, while of every other race four, six, seven, or eight individuals are named, no less than seven and twenty names follow &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1502;&#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;, though all these persons could hardly have belonged to one race, unless the greater number of males therein had married strange wives. Besides, no names of inhabitants of cities of Judah and Benjamin are given in this list (as in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/2-21.htm">Ezra 2:21-28</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/2-33.htm">Ezra 2:33-35</a>), although it is stated in <a href="/ezra/10-7.htm">Ezra 10:7</a> and <a href="/ezra/10-14.htm">Ezra 10:14</a> that not only the men of Jerusalem, but also dwellers in other cities, had contracted these prohibited marriages, and been summoned to Jerusalem, that judgment might be pronounced in their several cases. These reasons make it probable that the twenty-seven persons enumerated in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/10-34.htm">Ezra 10:34-42</a> were inhabitants of various localities in Judah, and not merely individuals belonging to a single house. This supposition cannot, however, be further corroborated, since even the lxx and 1 Esdr. read the name Bani in <a href="/ezra/10-27.htm">Ezra 10:27</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/10-34.htm">Ezra 10:34</a>, nor can any conjecture respecting the correct reading laying claim to probability be ventured on. In the single names, the Greek texts of the Septuagint and 1 Esdras frequently differ from the Hebrew text, but the differences are almost all of a kind to furnish no material for criticism. A considerable number of these names reappear in the lists of names in the book of Nehemiah, but under circumstances which nowhere make the identity of the persons bearing them certain. </body></html>
