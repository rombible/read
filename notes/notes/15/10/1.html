The case is sad, but it is not desperate; the disease threatening, but not incurable. Now that the people begin to lament, a spirit of repentance seems to be poured out; now there is hope that God will forgive, and have mercy. The sin that rightly troubles us, shall not ruin us. In melancholy times we must observe what makes for us, as well as against us. And there may be good hopes through grace, even where there is the sense of great guilt before God. The case is plain; what has been done amiss, must be undone again as far as possible; nothing less than this is true repentance. Sin must be put away, with a resolution never to have any thing more to do with it. What has been unjustly got, must be restored. Arise, be of good courage. Weeping, in this case, is good, but reforming is better. As to being unequally yoked with unbelievers, such marriages, it is certain, are sinful, and ought not to be made; but now they are not null, as they were before the gospel did away the separation between Jews and Gentiles.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ezra/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Before the house of God - i. e., in front of the temple, praying toward it <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/8-30.htm">1 Kings 8:30</a>, <a href="/1_kings/8-35.htm">1 Kings 8:35</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/6-10.htm">Daniel 6:10</a>, and thus in the sight of all the people who happened at the time to be in the great court. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ezra/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 10<p>Ezr 10:1-17.
