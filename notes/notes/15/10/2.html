The case is sad, but it is not desperate; the disease threatening, but not incurable. Now that the people begin to lament, a spirit of repentance seems to be poured out; now there is hope that God will forgive, and have mercy. The sin that rightly troubles us, shall not ruin us. In melancholy times we must observe what makes for us, as well as against us. And there may be good hopes through grace, even where there is the sense of great guilt before God. The case is plain; what has been done amiss, must be undone again as far as possible; nothing less than this is true repentance. Sin must be put away, with a resolution never to have any thing more to do with it. What has been unjustly got, must be restored. Arise, be of good courage. Weeping, in this case, is good, but reforming is better. As to being unequally yoked with unbelievers, such marriages, it is certain, are sinful, and ought not to be made; but now they are not null, as they were before the gospel did away the separation between Jews and Gentiles.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ezra/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Jehiel was one of those who had taken an idolatrous wife <a href="/ezra/10-26.htm">Ezra 10:26</a>; and Shechaniah had therefore had the evil brought home to him. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ezra/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2-4.

He spoke in the general name of the people, and his conduct evinced a tender conscience, as well as no small fortitude in making such a proposal; for as his father and five paternal uncles (Ezr 10:26) were involved in the guilt of unlawful marriages, he showed, by the measure he recommended, that he deemed it better to obey God than to please his nearest relatives.<p>yet now there is hope in Israel concerning this thing&#8212;This hope, however, depended on timely measures of reformation, and therefore, instead of surrendering themselves to despair or despondency, he counselled them to amend their error without delay, relying on God's mercy for the past. Though the proposal may seem harsh and cruel, yet in the peculiar circumstances of the Jews it was just as well as necessary; and he urged the duty of seeing it executed on Ezra, as the only person competent to carry it into effect, being possessed of skill and address for so delicate and difficult a work, and invested by God, and under Him by the Persian king (Ezr 7:23-28), with the requisite authority to enforce it.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ezra/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> He saith <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">we, </span> either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

And now give not your daughters unto their sons, neither take their daughters unto your sons (for wives), nor seek their peace nor their wealth for ever; that ye may be strong, and eat the good of the land, and leave it for an inheritance to your children for ever." The words of the prophets introduced by &#1500;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; are found in these terms neither in the prophetical books nor the Pentateuch. They are not, therefore, to be regarded as a verbal quotation, but only as a declaration that the prohibition of intermarriage with the heathen had been inculcated by the prophets. The introduction of this prohibition by the words: the land unto which ye go to possess it, refers to the Mosaic age, and in using it Ezra had chiefly in view <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-1.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1-3</a>. He interweaves, however, with this passage other sayings from the Pentateuch, e.g., <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-7.htm">Deuteronomy 23:7</a>, and from the prophetic writings, without designing to make a verbal quotation. He says quite generally, by His servants the prophets, as the author of the books of Kings does in similar cases, e.g., <a href="/2_kings/17-23.htm">2 Kings 17:23</a>; <a href="/2_kings/21-10.htm">2 Kings 21:10</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/24-2.htm">2 Kings 24:2</a>, where the leading idea is, not to give the saying of some one prophet, but to represent the truth in question as one frequently reiterated. The sayings of Moses in Deuteronomy also bear a prophetical character; for in this book he, after the manner of the prophets, seeks to make the people lay to heart the duty of obeying the law. It is true that we do not meet in the other books of Scripture a special prohibition of marriages with Canaanites, though in the prophetical remarks, <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/3-6.htm">Judges 3:6</a>, such marriages are reproved as occasions of seducing the Israelites to idolatry, and in the prophetic descriptions of the whoredoms of Israel with Baalim, and the general animadversions upon apostasy from the Lord, the transgression of this prohibition is implicitly included; thus justifying the general expression, that God had forbidden the Israelites to contract such marriages, by His servants the prophets. Besides, we must here take into consideration the threatening of the prophets, that the Lord would thrust Israel out of the land for their sins, among which intermarriage with the Canaanites was by no means the least. Ezra, moreover, makes use of the general expression, "by the prophets," because he desired to say that God had not merely forbidden these marriages one or twice in the law, but had also repeatedly inculcated this prohibition by the prophets. The law was preached by the prophets when they reiterated what was the will of God as revealed in the law of Moses. In this respect Ezra might well designate the prohibition of the law as the saying of the prophets, and cite it as pronounced according to the circumstances of the Mosaic period.<p>(Note: It is hence evident that these words of Ezra afford no evidence against the single authorship of the Pentateuch. The inference that a saying of the law, uttered during the wanderings in the wilderness, is here cited as a saying of the prophets the servants of Jahve, is, according to the just remark of Bertheau, entirely refuted even by the fact that the words cited are nowhere found in the Pentateuch in this exact form, and that hence Ezra did not intend to make a verbal quotation.)<p>The words: the land into which ye go, etc., recall the introduction of the law in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-1.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1</a>, etc.; but the description of the land as a land of uncleanness through the uncleanness of the people, etc., does not read thus either in the Pentateuch or in the prophets. &#1504;&#1491;&#1468;&#1492;, the uncleanness of women, is first applied to moral impurity by the prophets: comp. <a href="/lamentations/1-17.htm">Lamentations 1:17</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/7-20.htm">Ezekiel 7:20</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-17.htm">Ezekiel 36:17</a>, comp. <a href="/isaiah/64-5.htm">Isaiah 64:5</a>. The expression &#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1492; &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1492;, from edge to edge, i.e., from one end to the other, like &#1500;&#1508;&#1492; &#1508;&#1468;&#1492;,   <a href="/2_kings/10-21.htm">2 Kings 10:21</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/21-16.htm">2 Kings 21:16</a>, is taken from vessels filled to their upper rim. &#1493;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; introduces the consequence: and now, this being the case. The prohibition &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1514;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; &#1488;&#1500; is worded after <a href="/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3</a>. The addition: nor seek their peace, etc., is taken almost verbally from <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-7.htm">Deuteronomy 23:7</a>, where this is said in respect of the Ammonites and Moabites. &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1494;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468; &#1500;&#1502;&#1488;&#1503; recalls <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-8.htm">Deuteronomy 11:8</a>, and the promise: that ye may eat the good of the land for ever, <a href="/isaiah/1-19.htm">Isaiah 1:19</a>. &#1500;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501; &#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501;, and leave it for an inheritance to your children, does not occur in this form in the Pentateuch, but only the promise: that they and their children should possess the land for ever.
