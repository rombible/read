And when sin is repented of and forsaken, God will forgive it; but the blood of Christ, our Sin-offering, is the only atonement which takes away our guilt. No seeming repentance or amendment will benefit those who reject Him, for self-dependence proves them still unhumbled. All the names written in the book of life, are those of penitent sinners, not of self-righteous persons, who think they have no need of repentance.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ezra/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They gave their hands - i. e., "solemnly pledged themselves" (compare the marginal references).<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ezra/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19. they gave their hands&#8212;that is, came under a solemn engagement, which was usually ratified by pledging the right hand (Pr 6:1; Eze 17:18). The delinquents of the priestly order bound themselves to do like the common Israelites (Ezr 10:25), and sought to expiate their sin by sacrificing a ram as a trespass offering.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ezra/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/ezra/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And they gave their hands that they would put away their wives,.... They proposed to do it, and actually did it: <p>and being guilty; of which they were fully convinced: <p>they offered a ram of the flock for their trespass; to make atonement for it, and thereby set an example to others to do the like. Aben Ezra observes, that we do not find that the trespass offering was a mulct to such who married strange wives, and conjectures, that it was the advice of the chief men to do it. From hence, to the end of <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/10-43.htm">Ezra 10:43</a>, is a list of the men that had married strange wives, and put them away; those in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/10-20.htm">Ezra 10:20</a>, were priests; in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/10-23.htm">Ezra 10:23</a>, Levites, and those of them who were singers or porters; the rest were Israelites: and it is a very common distinction, in rabbinical writers, to distinguish the Jews into priests, Levites, and Israelites; of these we know no more than their names; some of the heads of the families may be observed in <a href="/ezra/2-1.htm">Ezra 2:1</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/ezra/10.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And of the sons of Elam; Mattaniah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, and Abdi, and Jeremoth, and Eliah.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/ezra/10.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">26</span>. <span class="ital">Jehiel</span>] ‘of the sons of Elam’, see note on <a href="/ezra/10-2.htm" title="And Shechaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam, answered and said to Ezra, We have trespassed against our God, and have taken strange wives of the people of the land: yet now there is hope in Israel concerning this thing.">Ezra 10:2</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezra/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jehiel</span>.

Judging by <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/2-36.htm">Ezra 2:36</a>, these were among the descendants of Jedaiah, a section of the house of the high-priestly family (see rem. on <a href="/ezra/2-36.htm">Ezra 2:36</a>), and were therefore distant cousins of the high priest. They gave their hands, i.e., bound themselves by shaking hands, to put away their wives, i.e., to dismiss them, and to sever them from the congregation of Israel, &#1493;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, "and guilty a ram for their trespass," i.e., condemned to bring a ram as a trespass-offering. &#1493;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; is to be regarded as the continuation of the infinitive clause &#1500;&#1492;&#1493;&#1510;&#1497;&#1488;. As elsewhere, infinitive clauses are continued without anything further in the verb. finit. (comp. Ewald, 350); so here also does the adjective &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; follow, requiring that &#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514; should be mentally supplied. &#1488;&#1497;&#1500;&#1470;&#1510;&#1488;&#1503;, a ram of the flock, is, as an accusative of more exact definition, dependent on &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;. This trespass-offering was imposed upon them according to the principle of the law, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/5-14.htm">Leviticus 5:14</a>, etc., because they had committed a &#1502;&#1506;&#1500; against the Lord, which needed expiation; see on <a href="/leviticus/5-14.htm">Leviticus 5:14</a>. - In what follows, only the names of the individuals, and a statement of the families they belonged to, are given, without repeating that the same obligations, namely, the dismissal of their strange wives, and the bringing of a trespass-offering, were imposed on them also, this being self-evident from the context. - Among the sons of Immer were three, among the sons of Harim five, among the sons of Pashur six offenders; in all, eighteen priests. By comparing <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/2-36.htm">Ezra 2:36-39</a>, we perceive that not one of the orders of priests who returned with Zerubbabel was free from participation in this transgression. Some of the names given, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/10-20.htm">Ezra 10:20-22</a>, reappear in the lists in <a href="/nehemiah/8-4.htm">Nehemiah 8:4</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/10-2.htm">Nehemiah 10:2-9</a>, and may belong to the same individuals. </body></html>
