Ezra the priest stood up, and said&#8212;Having fully represented the enormity of their sin and urged them to dissolve their unlawful connections, he was gratified by receiving a prompt acknowledgment of the justice of his reproof and a promise of compliance with his recommendation. But as the weather was ungenial and the defaulters were too numerous to be passed in review at one time, it was resolved that a commission should be appointed to examine into the whole matter. These commissioners, assisted by the judges and elders of the respective cities, made a minute investigation into every case, and after three months' labor completely removed all traces of the abuse.

Slight opposition.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahaziah the son of Tikvah were employed about this</span> matter] R.V. <span class="bld">stood up against</span> (Marg. Or, <span class="ital">were appointed over</span>) <span class="bld">this</span> matter.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The word ‘only’, the English reader should take notice, is not used in the sense of ‘alone’, but as an adversative, ‘notwithstanding’, ‘nevertheless’. It would therefore naturally introduce the mention of an exception or of an opposition.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>There are two views as to the correct rendering of the verse. The point of difference lies in the Hebrew words variously rendered ‘were appointed over’ and ‘stood up against’.—(1) The rendering of the A.V. ‘were employed about’, though less accurate, agrees with that of the R.V. margin ‘were appointed over’.—The Hebrew literally translated is ‘stood over’; (<span class="ital">a</span>) it is noticeable that this verb to ‘stand’ is the same as that used in the previous <a href="/ezra/10-12.htm" title="Then all the congregation answered and said with a loud voice, As you have said, so must we do.">Ezra 10:12</a> ‘Let now our rulers <span class="ital">be appointed</span> (Heb. stand)’. If there were no other point to be considered, it would seem most natural that the narrative should be resumed with the same verb as had just occurred in a reported speech and with the repetition of the phrase ‘about this matter’ (<a href="/ezra/9-15.htm" title="O LORD God of Israel, you are righteous: for we remain yet escaped, as it is this day: behold, we are before you in our trespasses: for we cannot stand before you because of this.">Ezra 9:15</a>). (<span class="ital">b</span>) After the people’s declaration, it was to be expected that the names of some of the commission would be recorded. (<span class="ital">c</span>) The use of the adversative may betaken to imply a departure from the first proposal of a commission. (<span class="ital">d</span>) The mention of Meshullam and Shabbethai, who ‘helped’, seems to suggest cooperation in the execution of, not in the opposition to, the scheme. (2) The rendering of the R.V. ‘stood up against’ has greater probability. (<span class="ital">a</span>) It accounts for the use of the adversative ‘only’. (<span class="ital">b</span>) The use of the words to ‘stand over or against’ in a hostile sense is supported by <a href="/1_chronicles/21-1.htm" title="And Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to number Israel.">1 Chronicles 21:1</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/20-23.htm" title="For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of mount Seir, utterly to slay and destroy them: and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, every one helped to destroy another.">2 Chronicles 20:23</a>; <a href="/daniel/8-25.htm" title="And through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and by peace shall destroy many: he shall also stand up against the Prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand.">Daniel 8:25</a>; <a href="/daniel/11-14.htm" title="And in those times there shall many stand up against the king of the south: also the robbers of your people shall exalt themselves to establish the vision; but they shall fall.">Daniel 11:14</a>. (<span class="ital">c</span>) Except for this verse we should have no record of any of the opposition, which, considering the extreme severity of the measures, would be almost inevitable. It is indeed a reasonable objection that the mention of the opposition is very awkwardly inserted between the people’s declaration and the statement (in <a href="/ezra/10-16.htm" title="And the children of the captivity did so. And Ezra the priest, with certain chief of the fathers, after the house of their fathers, and all of them by their names, were separated, and sat down in the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter.">Ezra 10:16</a>) of their action. But this objection applies to the verse (15) as a whole rather than to the special interpretation of it, and, as a matter of fact, the abruptness of the insertion is due to the Compiler’s work, and is scarcely lessened by the alternative interpretation. Another objection, that the word ‘help’ used of Meshullam and Shabbethai would not naturally express their support of an opposition, can only be partially admitted. It is true that, as only four opponents are mentioned by name, they might much more easily have been grouped together, unless there was some special reason for separating them. But whatever special reason there was for separating the pairs of names, would apply equally well, whether the individuals were said to carry out or to oppose the scheme. This objection therefore like the other is equally well raised against any explanation of the verse; it does not affect the selection to be made between the two renderings.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Accepting the rendering of the R.V., we need not suppose that these four individuals were the only opponents of Ezra’s policy. They are here mentioned as the leaders of the opposition, and there is every reason to suppose that their opinions must have been shared by very many.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and Meshullam</span>] Possibly the same as the Meshullam mentioned in <a href="/ezra/10-29.htm" title="And of the sons of Bani; Meshullam, Malluch, and Adaiah, Jashub, and Sheal, and Ramoth.">Ezra 10:29</a>. If so, we may suppose from <a href="/ezra/10-19.htm" title="And they gave their hands that they would put away their wives; and being guilty, they offered a ram of the flock for their trespass.">Ezra 10:19</a> that he along with the others who had similarly offended ‘gave his hand’ that he would put away his wife. Perhaps he had been convinced of the public necessity for the action, which for private reasons he felt obliged to condemn. This conflict of feeling might account for his being described as only ‘helping’ the opponents.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Shabbethai the Levite</span>] This name does not occur in 23 or 24 among the Levites who had offended. Shabbethai may have opposed for other reasons, either because members of his family were implicated, or because he considered the letter of the law to be strained by the adoption of the proposed measures. The opposition of a Levite deserved especial record.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">helped them</span>] As if their position were a subordinate one in the opposition. They supported, but did not head the movement, cf. <a href="/1_kings/1-7.htm" title="And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest: and they following Adonijah helped him.">1 Kings 1:7</a> ‘they following Adonijah helped him’.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezra/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Only Jonathan...  and Jaha-ziah...  were employed about this matter.</span> If this were the true meaning of the passage it would contradict the next verse, by which it appears that Ezra himself, together with several "chiefs of the fathers" - probably identical with the "rulers and elders" of ver. 14 - took the matter in hand, and were occupied with it for three months. The true meaning of the clause, however, is almost certainly that which was assumed in the preceding paragraph: "Only Jonathan and Jahaziah <span class="accented">stood up against</span> this matter," or "<span class="accented">opposed"</span> it (see <a href="/1_chronicles/21-1.htm">1 Chronicles 21:1</a>; <a href="/daniel/8-25.htm">Daniel 8:25</a>; <a href="/daniel/11-14.htm">Daniel 11:14</a>, where the same expression has the sense of "oppose, resist"). <span class="cmt_word">Meshullam</span> <span class="cmt_word">and Shabbethai the Levite helped them.</span> The "Meshullam" intended is perhaps the person of the name mentioned in ver. 29 as having married an idolatrous wife. The others seem not to have had any personal interest in thwarting Ezra and preventing the reform. SETTLEMENT OF THE WHOLE MATTER BY THE REPUDIATION OF THE STRANGE WIVES (vers. 16, 17). The opposition made did not delay the business more than a few days. The great assembly had been held on the twentieth day of the ninth month. On the first day of the tenth month, little more than a week later, the commission for examining into the matter met under the presidency of Ezra, and commenced proceedings. The method of proceeding suggested at the great meeting was no doubt followed. The case of each city was taken separately. Its male inhabitants of full age attended, and its "elders" and "judges" sat on the commission as assessors while the conjugal position of their townsfolk was being investigated. Where a "mixed marriage" was proved the wife was repudiated. In 112 cases the necessity of repudiation was made out to the satisfaction of the commission, and this number of wives was put away. Probably the entire number of cases adjudicated upon was very much greater, since the commission continued at work for three months, and probably sat on seventy-five different days, judging (we may presume) three or four cases a day. On the whole, the small extent to which the evil had prevailed is remarkable; for 112 mixed marriages in a population where the adult males were about 40,000 would give only one such marriage to three hundred or three hundred and fifty legitimate ones. Nevertheless, evils in a community are not to be judged simply by their prevalence. Great evils must be checked at once, even though they have not extended far, lest, if they spread at all widely, they become irremediable. Ezra is to be commended for having perceived the greatness of the peril, and for having taken prompt and decided measures to check it, without waiting till it had got to a head, and so become uncontrollable. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ezra/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>After three days all the men of Judah and Benjamin assembled at Jerusalem. This took place on the twentieth day of the ninth month. On this statement of time, see the remark in <a href="/ezra/9-1.htm">Ezra 9:1</a>.

Geog. p. 287). </body></html>
