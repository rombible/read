But the reason is obvious enough. Some modern expositors are of their mind, and regard the act of Ezra as remedying one sin by another still greater. They bring Malachi (<a href="/ezra/2-15.htm" title="The children of Adin, four hundred fifty and four.">Ezra 2:15</a>) to their support; but nothing in his prediction about “the wife of thy youth,” rightly understood, tends to condemn the conduct here described.<p>(16) <span class= "bld">By their names.</span>—As in <a href="/ezra/8-20.htm" title="Also of the Nethinims, whom David and the princes had appointed for the service of the Levites, two hundred and twenty Nethinims: all of them were expressed by name.">Ezra 8:20</a>, the names were before the writer, but are not given.<p><span class= "bld">And sat down.</span>—That is, <span class= "ital">held a session.</span> This was ten days after the general assembly.<p>(17) <span class= "bld">And they made an end.</span>—Though the number of transgressors was only one hundred and thirteen, two months were occupied, which shows the care taken to do justice, especially to the claims of the women put away.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/ezra/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:6-14 There is hope concerning people, when they are convinced, not only that it is good to part with their sins, but that it is necessary; we must do it, or we are undone. So rich is the mercy, and so plenteous the redemption of God, that there is hope for the vilest who hear the gospel, and are willing to accept of free salvation. When sinners mourn for their sins, and tremble at the word of God, there is hope that they will forsake them. To affect others with godly sorrow or love to God, we must ourselves be affected. It was carefully agreed how this affair should be carried on.

While Ezra was making this confession before God, a numerous assemblage gathered around him, and wept aloud. From this point onwards Ezra relates the further course of events in such wise as to cast his own person in the background, and speaks of himself in the third person. The matter of his prayer is more definitely declared by &#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1492;&#1514;&#1493;&#1491;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;, and his posture in prayer by &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1514;&#1504;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500; &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1492;, weeping and casting himself down (lying on his knees, <a href="/ezra/9-5.htm">Ezra 9:5</a>).

The confirmatory clause: for the people wept much (&#1489;&#1499;&#1492; &#1492;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492;, a weeping in mass), furnishes the motive of so great a number of men, women, and children gathering around Ezra. Very many were as distressed as he was at the marriages with strange wives, and regarded them as a grievous trespass; hence they assembled weeping around him. </body></html>
