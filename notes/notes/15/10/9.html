The ‘ninth month’ was Chislev, corresponding nearly to our December. The Assyrian month Ki-shilivu is the same name. The month is mentioned in <a href="/nehemiah/1-1.htm" title="The words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah.

On the 15th of this month 168 b.c. the Temple was profaned and the altar polluted by Antiochus Epiphanes; on the 25th of this month, three years later, 165 b.c., Judas the Maccabee and his companions celebrated ‘the Dedication’ or Purification of the Temple, which was afterwards observed as an annual festival (cf. <a href="/john/10-22.htm" title="And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was winter.">John 10:22</a>). See <a href="//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/1-54.htm" title="Now the fifteenth day of the month Casleu, in the hundred forty and fifth year, they set up the abomination of desolation upon the altar, and builded idol altars throughout the cities of Juda on every side;">1Ma 1:54</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/4-59.htm" title="Moreover Judas and his brethren with the whole congregation of Israel ordained, that the days of the dedication of the altar should be kept in their season from year to year by the space of eight days, from the five and twentieth day of the month Casleu, with mirth and gladness.">1Ma 4:59</a>.

An area belonging to ‘the house of God’ in which the whole assembly could collect, must have been a large open court. See the same word in <a href="/deuteronomy/13-16.htm" title="And you shall gather all the spoil of it into the middle of the street thereof, and shall burn with fire the city, and all the spoil thereof every whit, for the LORD your God: and it shall be an heap for ever; it shall not be built again.">Deuteronomy 13:16</a> and <a href="/2_samuel/21-12.htm" title="And David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jabeshgilead, which had stolen them from the street of Bethshan, where the Philistines had hanged them, when the Philistines had slain Saul in Gilboa:">2 Samuel 21:12</a>, where an open place or square in the middle of a town gives a truer sense than the word ‘street’. The idea of the word in the original is width, not narrowness.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">trembling because of this matter</span>] The popular apprehension was aroused to the utmost, partly by the penalty for non-attendance at the assembly (<a href="/ezra/10-8.htm" title="And that whoever would not come within three days, according to the counsel of the princes and the elders, all his substance should be forfeited, and himself separated from the congregation of those that had been carried away.">Ezra 10:8</a>), partly by the rumours of the action proposed by Shecaniah and approved by the princes, partly by dread of Divine wrath at the national transgression. The verb used here for ‘trembling’ occurs elsewhere in the O. T. only in <a href="/daniel/10-11.htm" title="And he said to me, O Daniel, a man greatly beloved, understand the words that I speak to you, and stand upright: for to you am I now sent.

This was ‘the early rain’ following after seed-time (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/11-14.htm" title="That I will give you the rain of your land in his due season, the first rain and the latter rain, that you may gather in your corn, and your wine, and your oil.">Deuteronomy 11:14</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/5-24.htm" title="Neither say they in their heart, Let us now fear the LORD our God, that gives rain, both the former and the latter, in his season: he reserves to us the appointed weeks of the harvest.">Jeremiah 5:24</a>; <a href="/joel/2-23.htm" title="Be glad then, you children of Zion, and rejoice in the LORD your God: for he has given you the former rain moderately, and he will cause to come down for you the rain, the former rain, and the latter rain in the first month.">Joel 2:23</a>) as distinguished from ‘the latter rain’ of spring-time.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezra/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered themselves together unto Jerusalem.</span> This is of course to be understood with certain necessary or natural exceptions, as of the sick, the aged and infirm, and the youths under full age.

December is a rainy month in Palestine; and the incidental mention of "the great rain" is one of those small touches which stamp the writer as an eyewitness. ADDRESS OF EZRA, AND CONSENT OF THE PEOPLE TO PUT AWAY THE STRANGE WIVES (vers. 10- 14). Hitherto Ezra seems to have allowed the leading part in the matter to be taken by the civil authorities, whom he had found established in Jerusalem on his arrival (<a href="/ezra/9-1.htm">Ezra 9:1-8</a>). Now he came forward boldly, denouncing the sin committed, and as supreme governor commanding the repudiation of the strange wives. The assembled multitude consented, but urged that the matter required time; that the season was unsuitable for a prolonged stay of the whole body of country Jews at Jerusalem, and that the business would be most conveniently carried through by a standing commission consisting of the chief authorities of the city of Jerusalem, who should take the case of each country town separately, and, in conjunction with the elders and judges of each town, investigate the alleged mixed marriages of each locality, and adjudicate upon them. By this arrangement the bulk of the country Jews would be allowed at once to return home; and the case of each locality being taken separately, only a small number would at any given time be suffering the inconvenience of a compulsory absence from their residences, and the expense of a stay of some duration in the capital. The proposal was reasonable, and it appears to have approved itself to Ezra and his advisers, and to have been at once adopted. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ezra/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Then one of the sons of Elam, Shecaniah, the son of Jehiel, stood forth from amidst the assembly, and uttered the confession: "We have been unfaithful towards our God by marrying strange wives, but there is yet hope for Israel concerning this thing. We will now make a covenant with God to put away all the strange wives and their children from the congregation, according to the counsel of the Lord, and of those who fear the commandment of our God, that it may be done according to the law." Shecaniah, of the sons of Elam (comp. <a href="/ezra/2-7.htm">Ezra 2:7</a>; <a href="/ezra/8-7.htm">Ezra 8:7</a>), is a different person from the descendant of Zattu, mentioned <a href="/ezra/8-5.htm">Ezra 8:5</a>; nor is Jehiel identical with the individual whose name occurs in <a href="/ezra/10-26.htm">Ezra 10:26</a>. &#1493;&#1504;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;, and have brought home strange wives. &#1492;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489;, to cause to dwell (in one's house), said in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/10-10.htm">Ezra 10:10</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/10-14.htm">Ezra 10:14</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/10-17.htm">Ezra 10:17</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/10-18.htm">Ezra 10:18</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-23.htm">Nehemiah 13:23</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-27.htm">Nehemiah 13:27</a>, of bringing a wife home. Shecaniah founds his hope for Israel in this trespass upon the circumstance, that they bind themselves by a solemn covenant before God to put away this scandal from the congregation, and to act in conformity with the law. To make a covenant with our God, i.e., to bind themselves by an oath with respect to God, comp. <a href="/2_chronicles/29-10.htm">2 Chronicles 29:10</a>. &#1492;&#1493;&#1510;&#1497;&#1488;, to put away - the opposite of &#1492;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489;. All the wives are, according to the context, all the strange women (<a href="/ezra/10-2.htm">Ezra 10:2</a>), and that which is born of them, their children. Instead of &#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497; &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1510;&#1514;, according to the counsel of the Lord, De Wette, Bertheau, and others, following the paraphrase in the lxx and 1 Esdras, read &#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497;, according to the counsel of my lord, i.e., of Ezra. But this paraphrase being of no critical authority, there is no sufficient reason for the alteration. For Shecaniah to call Ezra my lord sounds strange, since usually this title was only given by servants to their master, or subjects to their sovereign, and Shecaniah afterwards addresses him simply as thou. Besides, Ezra had given no advice at all in this matter, and still less had he come to any resolution about it with the God-fearing members of the community. &#1497;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; after the preceding &#1504;&#1499;&#1512;&#1514;&#1470;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514;, we will make a covenant, must be taken as hortative: and let it be done according to the law. &#1489;&#1468; &#1495;&#1512;&#1491;, caring for with trembling. </body></html>
