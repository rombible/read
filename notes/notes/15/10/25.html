This is almost certainly due to an early error in the text. The conjecture that the name of Bigvai (<a href="/ezra/2-14.htm" title="The children of Bigvai, two thousand fifty and six.">Ezra 2:14</a>) or of Bezai (<a href="/ezra/2-17.htm" title="The children of Bezai, three hundred twenty and three.">Ezra 2:17</a>) should be, in one instance or the other, substituted for that of Bani is not improbable, especially as otherwise there are seven houses (<a href="/context/ezra/2-12.htm" title="The children of Azgad, a thousand two hundred twenty and two....">Ezra 2:12-19</a>) in succession not mentioned here.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="ital">b</span>) The disproportionately large number of offenders belonging to the second Bani (<a href="/ezra/10-34.htm" title="Of the sons of Bani; Maadai, Amram, and Uel,">Ezra 10:34</a>) makes it probable that we have lost the names of three other houses. It will be noticed that the ‘sons of Nebo’ are the only representatives of about twenty towns mentioned in <a href="/context/ezra/2-21.htm" title="The children of Bethlehem, an hundred twenty and three....">Ezra 2:21-35</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="ital">c</span>) The order of the list of houses is here quite different from that of Ezra 2, an illustration probably of the faithfulness with which the various extant lists were reproduced.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezra/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Of Israel</span>. <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "of the laity." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ezra/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Among the priests there stand first, four names of sons and brethren of the high priest Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, who returned to Jerusalem with Zerubbabel. &#1488;&#1495;&#1497;&#1493;, his (Jeshua's) brethren. Judging by <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/2-36.htm">Ezra 2:36</a>, these were among the descendants of Jedaiah, a section of the house of the high-priestly family (see rem. on <a href="/ezra/2-36.htm">Ezra 2:36</a>), and were therefore distant cousins of the high priest. They gave their hands, i.e., bound themselves by shaking hands, to put away their wives, i.e., to dismiss them, and to sever them from the congregation of Israel, &#1493;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, "and guilty a ram for their trespass," i.e., condemned to bring a ram as a trespass-offering. &#1493;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; is to be regarded as the continuation of the infinitive clause &#1500;&#1492;&#1493;&#1510;&#1497;&#1488;. As elsewhere, infinitive clauses are continued without anything further in the verb. finit. (comp. Ewald, 350); so here also does the adjective &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; follow, requiring that &#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514; should be mentally supplied. &#1488;&#1497;&#1500;&#1470;&#1510;&#1488;&#1503;, a ram of the flock, is, as an accusative of more exact definition, dependent on &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;. This trespass-offering was imposed upon them according to the principle of the law, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/5-14.htm">Leviticus 5:14</a>, etc., because they had committed a &#1502;&#1506;&#1500; against the Lord, which needed expiation; see on <a href="/leviticus/5-14.htm">Leviticus 5:14</a>. - In what follows, only the names of the individuals, and a statement of the families they belonged to, are given, without repeating that the same obligations, namely, the dismissal of their strange wives, and the bringing of a trespass-offering, were imposed on them also, this being self-evident from the context. - Among the sons of Immer were three, among the sons of Harim five, among the sons of Pashur six offenders; in all, eighteen priests. By comparing <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/2-36.htm">Ezra 2:36-39</a>, we perceive that not one of the orders of priests who returned with Zerubbabel was free from participation in this transgression. Some of the names given, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/10-20.htm">Ezra 10:20-22</a>, reappear in the lists in <a href="/nehemiah/8-4.htm">Nehemiah 8:4</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/10-2.htm">Nehemiah 10:2-9</a>, and may belong to the same individuals. </body></html>
