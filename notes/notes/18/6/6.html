Therefore life itself, when it has lost those comforts, which are the seasoning to it, and give it its relish, then becomes insipid, so that it is nothing more than a burden. Now, if men commonly complain of their meat when it is only unsavoury, how much more when it is so bitter as mine is? Some commentators, however, consider Job here as referring to Eliphaz’s discourse, which had been insipid and disagreeable to him, as having no substance, and carrying no weight with it: like unsavoury food, not seasoned nor cured, instead of satisfying and instructing him, it had been nauseous and offensive, like corrupted meat to a weak and sick stomach. <span class="ital">Or is there any taste in the white of an egg? — </span>“Our version of this clause,” says Dr. Dodd, “seems to be void of all sense and connection with what goes before.

In addition to outward troubles, the inward sense of God's wrath took away all his courage and resolution. The feeling sense of the wrath of God is harder to bear than any outward afflictions. What then did the Saviour endure in the garden and on the cross, when he bare our sins, and his soul was made a sacrifice to Divine justice for us! Whatever burden of affliction, in body or estate, God is pleased to lay upon us, we may well submit to it as long as he continues to us the use of our reason, and the peace of our conscience; but if either of these is disturbed, our case is very pitiable. Job reflects upon his friends for their censures. He complains he had nothing offered for his relief, but what was in itself tasteless, loathsome, and burdensome.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Can that which is unsavoury - Which is insipid, or without taste.<p>Be eaten without salt - It is necessary to add salt in order to make it either palatable or wholesome. The literal truth of this no one can doubt, Insipid food cannot be relished, nor would it long sustain life. "The Orientals eat their bread often with mere salt, without any other addition except some dry and pounded summer-savory, which last is the common method at Aleppo." Russell's Natural History of Aleppo, p. 27. It should be remembered, also, that the bread of the Orientals is commonly mere unleavened cakes; see Rosenmuller, Alte u. neue Morgenland, on <a href="/genesis/18-6.htm">Genesis 18:6</a>. The idea of Job in this adage or proverb is, that there was a fitness and propriety in things. Certain things went together, and were necessary companions. One cannot be expected without the other; one is incomplete without the other. Insipid food requires salt in order to make it palatable and nutritious, and so it is proper that suffering and lamentation should be united.<p>There was a reason for his complaints, as there was for adding salt to unsavory food. Much perplexity, however, has been felt in regard to this whole passage; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/6-6.htm">Job 6:6-7</a>. Some have supposed that Job means to rebuke Eliphaz severely for his harangue on the necessity of patience, which he characterizes as insipid, impertinent, and disgusting to him; as being in fact as unpleasant to his soul as the white of an egg was to the taste. Dr. Good explains it as meaning, "Doth that which has nothing of seasoning, nothing of a pungent or irritating power within it, produce pungency or irritation? I too should be quiet and complain not, if I had nothing provocative or acrimonious; but alas! the food I am doomed to partake of is the very calamity which is most acute to my soul, that which I most loathe, and which is most grievous or trying to my palate." But the real sense of this first part of the verse is, I think, that which is expressed above - that insipid food requires proper condiment, and that in his sufferings there was a real ground for lamentation and complaint - as there was for making use of salt in that which is unsavory. I see no reason to think that he meant in this to reproach Eliphaz for an insipid and unmeaning address.<p>Or is there any taste in the white of an egg? - Critics and commentators have been greatly divided about the meaning of this. The Septuagint renders it, &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769; &#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9; &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2;  ei de kai esti geuma en re&#772;masi kenois; is there any taste in vain words? Jerome (Vulgate), "can anyone taste that which being tasted produces death?" The Targums render it substantially as it is in our version. The Hebrew word rendered "white" (&#1512;&#1497;&#1512;  r&#305;&#770;yr) means properly spittle; <a href="/1_samuel/21-13.htm">1 Samuel 21:13</a>. If applied to an egg, it means the white of it, as resembling spittle. The word rendered "egg" (&#1495;&#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;  challa&#770;mu&#770;th) occurs nowhere else in the Scriptures. If it be regarded as derived from &#1495;&#1500;&#1501;  cha&#770;lam, to sleep, or dream, it may denote somnolency or dreams, and then fatuity, folly, or a foolish speech, as resembling dreams; and many have supposed that Job meant to characterize the speech of Eliphaz as of this description.<p>The word may mean, as it does in Syriac, a species of herb, the "purslain" (Gesenius), proverbial for its insipidity among the Arabs, Greeks, and Romans, but which was used as a salad; and the whole phrase here may denote purslain-broth, and hence, an insipid discourse. This is the interpretation of Gesenius. But the more common and more probable explanation is that of our common version, denoting the white of an egg. But what is the point of the remark as Job uses it? That it is a proverbial expression, is apparent; but in what way Job meant to apply it, is not so clear. The Jews say that he meant to apply it to the speech of Eliphaz as being insipid and dull, without anything to penetrate the heart or to enliven the fancy; a speech as disagreeable to the mind as the white of an egg was insipid to the taste. Rosenmuller supposes that he refers to his afflictions as being as unpleasant to bear as the white of an egg was to the taste. It seems to me that the sense of all the proverbs used here is about the same, and that they mean, "there is a reason for everything which occurs. The ass brays and the ox lows only when destitute of food. That which is insipid is unpleasant, and the white of an egg is loathsome. So with my afflictions. They produce loathing and disgust, My very food <a href="/job/6-7.htm">Job 6:7</a> is disagreeable, and everything seems tasteless as the most insipid food would. Hence the language which I have used - language spoken not without reason, and expressive of this state of the soul." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. unsavoury&#8212;tasteless, insipid. Salt is a chief necessary of life to an Easterner, whose food is mostly vegetable.<p>the white&#8212;literally, "spittle" (1Sa 21:13), which the white of an egg resembles.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/job/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Can or do men use to eat unsavoury meats with delight, or without complaint? This is either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. A reflection upon Eliphaz’s discourse, as unsavoury, which could not give him any conviction or satisfaction. But his censure of Eliphaz’s speech begins not till <span class="bld"><a href="/job/6-14.htm" title="To him that is afflicted pity should be showed from his friend; but he forsakes the fear of the Almighty.">Job 6:14</a></span>, and then it proceeds. Or rather, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. A justification of Job’s complaints (of which both the foregoing and following verses treat) by another argument. Men do commonly complain of their meat when it is but unsavoury, how much more when it is so bitter as mine is! which is implied here, and expressed in the next verse; where the sense here begun is completed, and this general proposition is accommodated to Job’s condition. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In the white of an egg, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">in the white of a yolk</span>, i.e. which encompasseth the yolk of an egg. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/job/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt?.... As any sort of pulse, peas, beans, lentiles, &amp;c. which have no savoury and agreeable taste unless salted, and so many other things; and are disagreeable to men, and not relished by them, and more especially things bitter and unpleasant; and therefore Job intimates, it need not seem strange that the wormwood and water of gall, or the bread of adversity and water of affliction, he was fed with, should be so distasteful to him, and he should show such a nausea of it, and an aversion to it, and complain thereof as he did: though some apply this to the words and speeches of Eliphaz, and his friends he represented, which with Job were insipid and foolish talk, and very unsuitable and disagreeable to him, yea, loathed and abhorred by him, not being seasoned with the salt of prudence, grace, and goodness, see <a href="//biblehub.com/colossians/4-6.htm">Colossians 4:6</a>, <p>or is there any taste in the white of an egg? none at all. The same things are designed by this as the former. Mr. Broughton renders it, "the white of the yolk"; and Kimchi says (d) it signifies, in the language of the Rabbins, the red part of the yolk, the innermost part; but others, from the use of the word in the Arabic language, interpret it of the froth of milk (e), which is very tasteless and insipid: but the first of the words we render "white" always signifies "spittle"; and some of the Jewish writers (f) call it the spittle of soundness, or a sound man, which has no taste, in distinction from that of a sick man, which has; and the latter word comes from one which signifies to dream; and Jarchi observes, that some so understand it here; and the whole is by some rendered, "is there any taste" or "savour in the spittle of a dream" or "drowsiness" (g)? such as flows from a person asleep, or in a dream; and so may fitly express the vain and empty words, as the Septuagint translate the phrase, of Job's friends, in his esteem, which to him were no than the words of some idle and dreaming person, or were like the dribble of a fool or madman, as David mimicked, <a href="/1_samuel/21-13.htm">1 Samuel 21:13</a>; and it is observed (h), that the word "spittle" is very emphatically used, since it useless in judging of different tastes, and mixed with food, goes into nourishment, as the white of an egg. <p>(d) Sepher Shorash, rad.  so Ben Melech.

The whole of nature will be at peace with thee: the stones of the field, that they do not injure the fertility of thy fields; the wild beasts of the field, that they do not hurt thee and thy herds.

From this we see how deeply the Chokma had searched into the history of Paradise and the Fall. Since man, the appointed lord of the earth, has been tempted by a reptile, and has fallen by a tree, his relation to nature, and its relation to him, has been reversed: it is an incongruity, which is again as a whole put right (&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501;), as the false relation of man to God is put right.
