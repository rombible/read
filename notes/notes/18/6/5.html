To <span class="ital">bray </span>and <span class="ital">low </span>refer to expressions of grief and uneasiness. Job therefore compares his friends, with some smartness, to a <span class="ital">wild ass </span>exulting in its food, and to an <span class="ital">ox </span>perfectly satisfied with grateful pasture.” His words may be paraphrased thus: Even the brute beasts, when they have convenient food, are quiet and contented. So, it is no wonder that you complain not, who live in ease and prosperity, any more than I did when I wanted nothing; “happy yourselves, you do not condole with me in my wretchedness, nor mourn with me, but rather blame my mourning as importunate clamour, and as if I had behaved myself toward God with insolence and impatience.” — Schultens.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/job/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:1-7 Job still justifies himself in his complaints. In addition to outward troubles, the inward sense of God's wrath took away all his courage and resolution. The feeling sense of the wrath of God is harder to bear than any outward afflictions. What then did the Saviour endure in the garden and on the cross, when he bare our sins, and his soul was made a sacrifice to Divine justice for us! Whatever burden of affliction, in body or estate, God is pleased to lay upon us, we may well submit to it as long as he continues to us the use of our reason, and the peace of our conscience; but if either of these is disturbed, our case is very pitiable. Job reflects upon his friends for their censures. He complains he had nothing offered for his relief, but what was in itself tasteless, loathsome, and burdensome.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? - On the habits of the wild ass, see the notes at <a href="/job/11-12.htm">Job 11:12</a>. The meaning of Job here is, that he did not complain without reason; and this he illustrates by the fact that the wild animal that had a plentiful supply of food would be gentle and calm, and that when its bray was heard it was proof that it was suffering. So Job says that there was a reason for his complaining. He was suffering; and perhaps he means that his complaint was just as natural, and just as innocent, as the braying of the ass for its food. He should have remembered however, that he was endowed with reason, and that he was bound to evince a different spirit from the brute creation.<p>Or loweth the ox over his fodder? - That is, the ox is satisfied and uncomplaining when his needs are supplied. The fact that he lows is proof that he is in distress, or there is a reason for it. So Job says that his complaints were proof that he was in distress, and that there was a reason for his language of complaint. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. Neither wild animals, as the wild ass, nor tame, as the ox, are dissatisfied when well-supplied with food. The braying of the one and the lowing of the other prove distress and want of palatable food. So, Job argues, if he complains, it is not without cause; namely, his pains, which are, as it were, disgusting food, which God feeds him with (end of Job 6:7). But he should have remembered a rational being should evince a better spirit than the brute.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/job/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Thou wonderest that my disposition and carriage is so greatly altered from what it was, <span class="bld"><a href="/context/job/4-3.htm" title="Behold, you have instructed many, and you have strengthened the weak hands....">Job 4:3-5</a></span>, but thou mayst easily learn the reason of it from the brute beasts, the ass and ox, who when they have convenient and common food, are quiet and contented; but when they want that, they will resent it, and complain in their way by braying or lowing: see <span class="bld"><a href="/jeremiah/14-6.htm" title="And the wild asses did stand in the high places, they snuffed up the wind like dragons; their eyes did fail, because there was no grass.">Jeremiah 14:6</a></span>. And therefore my carriage is agreeable to those common principles of nature which are both in men and beasts, by which their disposition and deportment is generally suitable to their condition. It is no wonder that you complain not, who live in ease and prosperity; nor did I, when it was so with me; but if you felt what I feel, you would be as full of complaints as I am. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/job/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox over his fodder? No, they neither of them do, when the one is in a good pasture, and the other has a sufficiency of provender; but when they are in want of food, the one will bray, and the other will low, which are tones peculiar to those creatures, and express their mournful complaints; wherefore Job suggests, that should he make no moan and complaint in his sorrowful circumstances, he should be more stupid and senseless than those brute creatures: and he may have some respect to the different circumstances of himself and his friends; he himself, when he was in prosperity, made no complaints, as the wild ass brays not, and the ox lows not, when they have both food enough; but now, being in distress, he could not but utter his sorrow and trouble, as those creatures when in lack of food; and this may serve as an answer to his different conduct now and formerly, objected to him, <a href="/job/4-3.htm">Job 4:3</a>; and so his friends; they lived in great tranquillity and prosperity, as Aben Ezra observes, and roared and grieved not, which doubtless they would, were they in the same circumstances he was; though it became them, as things were, to have uttered words of condolence to their friend in distress, instead of sharp reproofs and hard censures. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Doth the <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox over his fodder?</span><p>(d) Do you think that I cry without cause, seeing the brute beasts do not complain when they have what they want.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/job/6.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5, 6</span>.

Others think of some insipid herb, and render: the slime (broth) of purslain. The reference in the passage is to Job’s afflictions, which he compares here to an insipid, and in next verse to a loathsome, food, cf. ch. <a href="/job/3-24.htm" title="For my sighing comes before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters.">Job 3:24</a>. Others have thought that the reference was to the insipid harangues of the friends. But such a reference entirely breaks the connexion.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass?</span> literally, <span class="accented">over grass</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> when he has grass under his feet, and has consequently no cause of complaint.

The whole of nature will be at peace with thee: the stones of the field, that they do not injure the fertility of thy fields; the wild beasts of the field, that they do not hurt thee and thy herds. The same promise that Hosea (<a href="/hosea/2-20.htm">Hosea 2:20</a>) utters in reference to the last days is here used individually. From this we see how deeply the Chokma had searched into the history of Paradise and the Fall. Since man, the appointed lord of the earth, has been tempted by a reptile, and has fallen by a tree, his relation to nature, and its relation to him, has been reversed: it is an incongruity, which is again as a whole put right (&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501;), as the false relation of man to God is put right. In <a href="//biblehub.com/job/5-24.htm">Job 5:24</a>, &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501; (which might also be adj.) is predicate: thou wilt learn (&#1493;&#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;, praet. consec. with accented ultima, as e.g., <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-39.htm">Deuteronomy 4:39</a>, here with Tiphcha initiale s. anterius, which does not indicate the grammatical tone-syllable) that thy tent is peace, i.e., in a condition of contentment and peace on all sides. <a href="/job/5-24.htm">Job 5:24</a> is to be arranged: And when thou examinest thy household, then thou lackest nothing, goest not astray, i.e., thou findest everything, without missing anything, in the place where thou seekest it.<p><a href="/job/5-25.htm">Job 5:25</a> reminds one of the Salomonic <a href="/psalms/72-16.htm">Psalm 72:16</a>. &#1510;&#1488;&#1510;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; in the Old Testament is found only in Isaiah and the book of Job. The meaning of the noun &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1495;, which occurs only here and <a href="//biblehub.com/job/30-2.htm">Job 30:2</a>, is clear. Referring to the verb &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1495;, Arabic qahila (qalhama), to be shrivelled up, very aged, it signifies the maturity of old age, - an idea which may be gained more easily if we connect &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1495; with &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492; (to be completed), like &#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495; with &#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; (to be hard).<p>continued...</body></html>
