The speaker may mean that, notwithstanding all that might befall him, his consolation would still be that he had never denied the words of the Holy One. The words “I would harden myself in sorrow” are the most doubtful, not occurring elsewhere in Scripture. Some render the two clauses, “I would exult, or rejoice, in pain that spareth not;” but “Let him not spare,” or “Though he spare not,” seems preferable. Others render, “Though I burn in sorrow.”<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/job/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:8-13 Job had desired death as the happy end of his miseries. For this, Eliphaz had reproved him, but he asks for it again with more vehemence than before. It was very rash to speak thus of God destroying him. Who, for one hour, could endure the wrath of the Almighty, if he let loose his hand against him? Let us rather say with David, O spare me a little. Job grounds his comfort upon the testimony of his conscience, that he had been, in some degree, serviceable to the glory of God. Those who have grace in them, who have the evidence of it, and have it in exercise, have wisdom in them, which will be their help in the worst of times.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Even that it would please God to destroy me - To put me to death, and to release me from my sorrows; compare <a href="//biblehub.com/job/3-20.htm">Job 3:20-21</a>. The word rendered "destroy" here (&#1491;&#1499;&#1488;  da&#770;ka&#770;') means properly to break in pieces, to crush, to trample under foot, to make small by bruising. Here the sense is, that Job wished that God would crush him, so as to take his life. The Septuagint renders it "wound" - &#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;  tro&#772;sato&#772;. The Chaldee renders it, "Let God, who has begun to make me poor, loose his hand and make me rich."<p>That he would let loose his hand - Job here represents the hand of God as bound or confined. He wishes that that fettered hand were released, and were so free in its inflictions that he might be permitted to die.<p>And cut me off - This expression, says Gesenius (Lexicon on the word &#1489;&#1510;&#1506;  betsa&#8219;), is a metaphor derived from a weaver, who, when his web is finished, cuts it off from the thrum by which it is fastened to the loom; see the notes at <a href="/isaiah/38-12.htm">Isaiah 38:12</a>.

The wrath of God is irresistible. The sting of his suffering, however, is the wrath of God which his spirit drinks as a draught of poison (comp. <a href="/job/21-20.htm">Job 21:20</a>), and consequently wrings from him, even from his deepest soul, the thought that God is become his enemy: therefore his is an endless suffering, and therefore is it that he speaks so despondingly. </body></html>
