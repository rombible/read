This he compares to the failing of brooks in summer. Those who rest their expectations on the creature, will find it fail when it should help them; whereas those who make God their confidence, have help in the time of need, Heb 4:16. Those who make gold their hope, sooner or later will be ashamed of it, and of their confidence in it. It is our wisdom to cease from man. Let us put all our confidence in the Rock of ages, not in broken reeds; in the Fountain of life, not in broken cisterns. The application is very close; for now ye are nothing. It were well for us, if we had always such convictions of the vanity of the creature, as we have had, or shall have, on a sick-bed, a death-bed, or in trouble of conscience. Job upbraids his friends with their hard usage. Though in want, he desired no more from them than a good look and a good word. It often happens that, even when we expect little from man, we have less; but from God, even when we expect much, we have more. Though Job differed from them, yet he was ready to yield as soon as it was made to appear that he was in error. Though Job had been in fault, yet they ought not to have given him such hard usage. His righteousness he holds fast, and will not let it go. He felt that there had not been such iniquity in him as they supposed. But it is best to commit our characters to Him who keeps our souls; in the great day every upright believer shall have praise of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Yea, ye overwhelm the fatherless - Job undoubtedly means that this should be applied to himself. He complains that they took advantage of his words, that they were disposed to pervert his meaning, and unkindly distorted what he said. The word rendered" fatherless" &#1497;&#1514;&#1493;&#1501;  ya&#770;tho&#770;m properly denotes an orphan; <a href="/exodus/22-22.htm">Exodus 22:22</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/10-18.htm">Deuteronomy 10:18</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/14-29.htm">Deuteronomy 14:29</a>. But it is possible that it is not to be taken in this limited signification here. The word is still retained in the Arabic language - the language spoken in the country where <a href="//biblehub.com/job/54.htm">Job 54</a>ed, - where the word &#1497;&#1514;&#1493;&#1501;  ya&#770;tho&#770;m means to be lonely, bereaved, etc. It may be that this idea occurs under the form of the word used here, that Job was lonely and bereaved; that he was as desolate and helpless as a fatherless child; and especially that they manifested a spirit like that of those who would oppress an orphan. The word "overwhelm" &#1514;&#1508;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;  tap&#305;&#770;ylu&#770; means properly, "ye fall upon;" that is, you deal with him violently. Or, it may mean here, in the Hiphil, "you cause to fall upon," referring to a net, and meaning, that they sprung a net for the orphan. So Rosenmuller and Noyes understand it. To do this was, in Oriental countries, regarded as a crime of special enormity, and is often so spoken of in the Bible; see the notes at <a href="/isaiah/1-17.htm">Isaiah 1:17</a>.<p>And ye dig a pit for your friend - You act toward your friend as hunters do toward wild beasts. They dig a pit and cover it over with brushwood to conceal it, and the hunted animal, deceived, falls into it unawares. So you endeavor to entrap your friend. You lay a plan for it. You conceal your design. You contrive to drive him into the pit that you have made, and urge him on until you have caught him in the use of unguarded language, or driven him to vent expressions that cover him with confusion. Instead of throwing a mantle of charity over his frailties and infirmities, you make the most of every word, take it out of its proper connection, and attempt to overwhelm him in shame and disgrace. On the method of hunting in ancient times, see the notes at -Job 18:8-10. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>27. literally, "ye cause" (supply, "your anger") [Umbreit], a net, namely, of sophistry [Noyes and Schuttens], to fall upon the desolate (one bereft of help, like the fatherless orphan);<p>and ye dig (a pit) for your friend&#8212;that is, try to ensnare him, to catch him in the use of unguarded language [Noyes]. (Ps 57:6); metaphor from hunters catching wild beasts in a pit covered with brushwood to conceal it. Umbreit from the Syriac, and answering to his interpretation of the first clause, has, "Would you be indignant against your friend?" The Hebrew in Job 41:6, means to "feast upon." As the first clause asks, "Would you catch him in a net?" so this follows up the image, "And would you next feast upon him, and his miseries?" So the Septuagint.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/job/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Yea; </span> your words are not only vain, and useless, and uncomfortable to me, but also grievous and pernicious. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Ye overwhelm, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">you rush or throw yourselves</span> upon him.

The Targum, however, translates after the Chethib: ye are become as though ye had never been, i.e., nothingness. Now, since &#1500;&#1488;, Aramaic &#1500;&#1492;, can (as <a href="/daniel/4-32.htm">Daniel 4:32</a> shows) be used as a substantive (a not  equals  a null), and the thought: ye are become nothing, your friendship proves itself equal to null, suits the imagery just used, we decide in favour of the Chethib; then in the figure the &#1489;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; &#1506;&#1500;&#1492; corresponds most to this, and is also, therefore, not to be explained away. The lxx, Syr., Vulg., translate &#1500;&#1497; instead of &#1500;&#1493;: ye are become it (such deceitful brooks) to me. Ewald proposes to read &#1500;&#1497; &#1492;&#1497;&#1497;&#1514;&#1501; &#1506;&#1514;&#1492; &#1499;&#1503; (comp. the explanation, Ges. 137, rem. 3), - a conjecture which puts aside all difficulty; but the sentence with &#1500;&#1488; commends itself as being bolder and more expressive. All the rest explains itself. It is remarkable that in <a href="/job/6-21.htm">Job 6:21</a> the reading &#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; is also found, instead of &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;: ye dreaded misfortune, and ye were then affrighted. &#1492;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468; is here, as an exception, properispomenon, according to Ges. 29, 3. &#1499;&#1468;&#1495;, as <a href="/proverbs/5-10.htm">Proverbs 5:10</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/26-20.htm">Leviticus 26:20</a>, what one has obtained by putting forth one's strength, syn. &#1495;&#1497;&#1500;, outward strength. </body></html>
