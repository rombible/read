Thus Job very properly applies the preceding most beautiful description of the torrents in the hot climates, to his three friends who thus disappointed his expectations. Indeed, it is a very fine image of pretended friends in adversity. When their help is most wanted and coveted, they are too apt to fail the expectations of those that trusted in them. They may properly enough be said to be either frozen or melted away by adversity. All their warm professions are congealed, as it were, when adverse circumstances have laid hold on their friends, and their friendship is quite dissolved and melted away. <span class="ital">Ye see my casting down, and are afraid — </span>You are shy of me, and afraid for yourselves, lest some further plague should come upon me, wherein you, for my sake, should be involved; or, lest I should be burdensome to you.

This he compares to the failing of brooks in summer. Those who rest their expectations on the creature, will find it fail when it should help them; whereas those who make God their confidence, have help in the time of need, Heb 4:16. Those who make gold their hope, sooner or later will be ashamed of it, and of their confidence in it. It is our wisdom to cease from man. Let us put all our confidence in the Rock of ages, not in broken reeds; in the Fountain of life, not in broken cisterns. The application is very close; for now ye are nothing. It were well for us, if we had always such convictions of the vanity of the creature, as we have had, or shall have, on a sick-bed, a death-bed, or in trouble of conscience. Job upbraids his friends with their hard usage. Though in want, he desired no more from them than a good look and a good word. It often happens that, even when we expect little from man, we have less; but from God, even when we expect much, we have more. Though Job differed from them, yet he was ready to yield as soon as it was made to appear that he was in error. Though Job had been in fault, yet they ought not to have given him such hard usage. His righteousness he holds fast, and will not let it go. He felt that there had not been such iniquity in him as they supposed. But it is best to commit our characters to Him who keeps our souls; in the great day every upright believer shall have praise of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For now ye are as nothing - Margin, "or, Ye are like to it, or them." In the margin also the word "nothing" is rendered "not." This variety arises from a difference of reading in the Hebrew text, many MSS. having instead of (&#1500;&#1488;  lo&#770;'), not, (&#1500;&#1493;  lo&#770;'), to him, or to it. Which is correct, it is not easy to determine. Rosenmuller supposes that it is only a variety in writing the word &#1500;&#1488;  l', where the waw is often used for .&#1488; The probability is, that it means, that they were as nothing - like the stream that had disappeared. This is the point of the comparison; and this Job now applies to his friends. They had promised much by their coming - like the streams when swollen by rains and melted ice. But now they were found to be nothing.<p>Ye see my casting down - &#1495;&#1514;&#1514;  cha&#774;thath - my being broken or crushed; my calamity. Vulgate, plugam. Septuagint, &#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;  trauma, wound.<p>And are afraid - Are timid and fearful.

As the dried-up brook is to the caravan, so are ye to me, namely, a nothing; ye might as well not be in existence [Umbreit]. The Margin "like to them," or "to it" (namely, the waters of the brook), is not so good a reading.<p>ye see, and are afraid&#8212;Ye are struck aghast at the sight of my misery, and ye lose presence of mind.

Once they seemed to be something to him; he thought them men wise, good, and religious, kind, bountiful, and tenderhearted; but now he found them otherwise, they were nothing to him as friends or as comforters in his distress; the "Cetib", or Scripture, is, as we read, and is followed by many; but the marginal reading is, "now ye are to it" (a); that is, ye are like to it, the brook whose waters he had been describing; so Jarchi interprets it; Mr. Broughton very agreeably takes in both, "so now ye are become like that, even nothing"; as that deceitful brook is no more, nor of any use to travellers fainting through thirst; so ye are like that, of no use and advantage to me in my affliction: <p>ye see my casting down; from a state of prosperity to a state of adversity; from a pinnacle of honour, from being the greatest man in the east, a civil magistrate, and the head of a flourishing family, to the lowest degree of disgrace and dishonour; from wealth and riches to want and poverty; as well as saw the inward dejection of his mind, through the poisoned arrows of the Almighty within him: <p>and ye are afraid; of the righteous judgments of God, taking these calamities to be such, and fearing the same or the like should fall on them, should they keep him company; or however should they patronize and defend him; and afraid also of being too near him, lest his breath, and the smell of him, should be infectious, and they should catch a distemper from him; or lest he should be expensive and troublesome to them. <p>(a)    "certe nunc fuistis illi", Bolducius; so Michaelis; "certe nunc estis similes illi", Pagninus, Vatablus, Mercerus. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For now ye are <span class="cverse3">{m}</span> nothing; ye see <i>my</i> casting down, and are afraid.</span><p>(m) That is, like this brook which deceives them who think to have water there in their need, as I looked for consolation from you.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/job/6.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">21</span>. <span class="ital">ye are nothing</span>] Or, <span class="ital">are become nothing</span>. Job applies his comparison. Another reading is: <span class="ital">ye are become it</span>, i. e. the deceitful, disappointing brook. The general sense remains the same.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">my casting down</span>] lit. <span class="ital">ye see a terror</span>. Job’s comparison of his friends to the brook is graphic and telling. In winter these brooks are full, but in summer when the thirsty caravan needs them and looks for them they are found to have disappeared before the heat. And Job’s friends may have been effusive in their offers of friendship when friendships were abundant, but now when he needs their aid, the sight of his terrible affliction, like the summer heat, dissipates their sympathy and makes them “nothing,” without power to help. In the words “ye see a terror and are afraid” Job insinuates more than that his friends are paralysed at the sight of his calamity, he means probably that, judging his calamity to be from God, they have not courage to shew him sympathy, cf. <a href="/job/13-7.htm" title="Will you speak wickedly for God? and talk deceitfully for him?">Job 13:7</a> <span class="ital">seq</span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For now ye are nothing</span>. Like the dried-up torrents, the comforters had come to nought; were wholly useless and unprofitable. Another reading gives the sense, "Ye are like to them" - "ye comforters," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "are like the winter torrents, and have misled me, as they misled the caravans." <span class="cmt_word">Ye see my casting down, and are afraid</span>. Here Job penetrates to the motive which had produced the conduct of his friends. They had come with good intentions, meaning to comfort and console him; but when they came, and saw what a wreck he was, how utterly "broken up" and ruined, they began to be afraid of showing too much friendliness. They thought him an object of the Divine vengeance, and feared lest, if they showed him sympathy, they might involve themselves in his punishment. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>14  To him who is consumed gentleness is due from his friend,<p>Otherwise he might forsake the fear of the Almighty.<p>15  My brothers are become false as a torrent,<p>As the bed of torrents which vanish away - <p>16  They were blackish from ice,<p>Snow is hidden in them - <p>17  In the time, when warmth cometh to them, they are destroyed.<p>It becometh hot, they are extinguished from their place.<p>Ewald supplies between <a href="/job/6-14.htm">Job 6:14</a> and <a href="/job/6-14.htm">Job 6:14</a> two lines which have professedly fallen out ("from a brother sympathy is due to the oppressed of God, in order he may not succumb to excessive grief"). Hitzig strongly characterizes this interpolation as a "pure swindle." There is really nothing wanting; but we need not even take &#1495;&#1505;&#1491;, with Hitz., in the signification reproach (like <a href="/proverbs/14-34.htm">Proverbs 14:34</a>): if reproach cometh to the sufferer from his friend, he forsaketh the fear of God. &#1502;&#1505; (from &#1502;&#1505;&#1505;, liquefieri) is one who is inwardly melted, the disheartened. Such an one should receive &#1495;&#1505;&#1491; from his friend, i.e., that he should restore him &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#836;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; (<a href="/galatians/6-1.htm">Galatians 6:1</a>). The waw (<a href="/job/6-14.htm">Job 6:14</a>) is equivalent to alioqui with the future subjunctive (vid., Ges. 127, 5). Harshness might precipitate him into the abyss from which love will keep him back. So Schnurrer: Afflicto exhibenda est ab amico ipsius humanitas, alioqui hic reverentiam Dei exuit. Such harshness instead of charity meets him from his brothers, i.e., friends beloved as brothers. In vain he has looked to them for reviving consolation. Theirs is no comfort; it is like the dried-up water of a wady. &#1504;&#1495;&#1500; is a mountain or forest brook, which comes down from the height, and in spring is swollen by melting ice and the snow that thaws on the mountain-tops; &#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#788;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;, i.e., a torrent swollen by winter water. The melting blocks of ice darken the water of such a wady, and the snow falling together is quickly hidden in its bosom (&#1492;&#1514;&#1506;&#1500;&#1468;&#1501;). If they begin to be warmed (Pual &#1494;&#1512;&#1489;, cognate to &#1510;&#1512;&#1489;, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-3.htm">Ezekiel 21:3</a>, aduri, and &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1507;, comburere), suddenly they are reduced to nothing (&#1504;&#1510;&#1502;&#1514;, exstingui); they vanish away &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;, when it becomes hot. The suffix is, with Ew., Olsh., and others, to be taken as neuter; not with Hirz., to be referred to a suppressed &#1488;&#1514;: when the season grows hot. job bewails the disappointment he has experienced, the "decline" of charity <p>(Note: Oetinger says that <a href="//biblehub.com/job/6-15.htm">Job 6:15-20</a> describe those who get "consumption" when they are obliged to extend "the breasts of compassion" to their neighbour.)<p>still further, by keeping to the figure of the mountain torrent. </body></html>
