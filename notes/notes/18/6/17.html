There “is a noble climax,” as Heath observes, in these last three verses; “a most poetical description of the torrents in the hot climates. By extraordinary cold they are frozen over, but the sun no sooner exerts its power than they melt; they are exhaled by the heat, till the stream for smallness is diverted into many channels; it yet lasts a little way, but is soon quite evaporated and lost.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/job/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:14-30 In his prosperity Job formed great expectations from his friends, but now was disappointed. This he compares to the failing of brooks in summer. Those who rest their expectations on the creature, will find it fail when it should help them; whereas those who make God their confidence, have help in the time of need, Heb 4:16. Those who make gold their hope, sooner or later will be ashamed of it, and of their confidence in it. It is our wisdom to cease from man. Let us put all our confidence in the Rock of ages, not in broken reeds; in the Fountain of life, not in broken cisterns. The application is very close; for now ye are nothing. It were well for us, if we had always such convictions of the vanity of the creature, as we have had, or shall have, on a sick-bed, a death-bed, or in trouble of conscience. Job upbraids his friends with their hard usage. Though in want, he desired no more from them than a good look and a good word. It often happens that, even when we expect little from man, we have less; but from God, even when we expect much, we have more. Though Job differed from them, yet he was ready to yield as soon as it was made to appear that he was in error. Though Job had been in fault, yet they ought not to have given him such hard usage. His righteousness he holds fast, and will not let it go. He felt that there had not been such iniquity in him as they supposed. But it is best to commit our characters to Him who keeps our souls; in the great day every upright believer shall have praise of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>What time - In the time; or after a time.<p>They wax warm - Gesenius renders this word (&#1497;&#1494;&#1512;&#1489;&#1493;  yezorebu&#770;) when they became narrow, and this version has been adopted by Noyes. The word occurs nowhere else. Taylor (Concord.) renders it, "to be dissolved by the heat of the sun." Jerome, fuerint dissipati - "in the time in which they are scattered." The Septuagint, &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b1; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; &#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;  takeisa therme&#772;s genomene&#772;s - "melting at the approach of heat." The Chaldee, "In the time in which the generation of the deluge sinned, they were scattered." Castell says that the word &#1494;&#1512;&#1489;  za&#770;rab in the Piel, as the word in Chaldee (&#1494;&#1512;&#1489;  zerab) means "to flow"; and also that it has the same signification as &#1510;&#1512;&#1489;  tsa&#770;rab, to become warm. In Syriac the word means to be straitened, bound, confined. On the whole, however, the connection seems to require us to understand it as it is rendered in our common translation, as meaning, that when they are exposed to the rays of a burning sun, they evaporate. They pour down from the mountains in torrents, but when they flow into burning sands, or become exposed to the intense action of the sun, they are dried up, and disappear.<p>They vanish - Margin, "are cut off." That is, they wander off into the sands of the desert until they are finally lost.<p>When it is hot - Margin, "in the heat thereof." When the summer comes, or when the rays of the sun are poured down upon them.<p>They are consumed - Margin, "extinguished." They are dried up, and furnish no water for the caravan. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17. wax warm&#8212;rather, "At the time when."

The ice and the snow, which, when the weather becomes warm, they melt away and disappear; and in like manner, he suggests his friends ceased to be friends to him in a time of adversity; the sun of affliction having looked upon him, they deserted him, at least did not administer comfort to him: <p>when it is hot they are consumed out of their place; when it is hot weather, and the sun has great strength then the waters, which swelled through the floods and fall of rain and snow, and which when frozen, looked black and big as if they had great depth in them, were quickly dried up, and no more to be seen in the place where they were; which still expresses the short duration of friendship among men, which Job had a sorrowful experience of. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">What time they wax warm, they vanish: when it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What time they wax warm, they vanish: when it is hot, they are consumed out of their place</span> (see the passage quoted from Dr. Geikie in the comment on ver. 15). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>11  What is my strength, that I should wait,<p>And my end, that I should be patient?<p>12  Is my strength like the strength of stones?<p>Or is my flesh brazen?<p>13  Or am I then not utterly helpless,<p>And continuance is driven from me?<p>The meaning of the question (<a href="/job/6-11.htm">Job 6:11</a>); is: Is not my strength already so wasted away, and an unfortunate end so certain to me, that a long calm waiting is as impossible as it is useless? &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1498;, to draw out the soul, is to extend and distribute the intensity of the emotion, to be forbearing, to be patient.
