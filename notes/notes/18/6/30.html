If we look at it in detail—as we must in order to explain it—then we are apt to look at it piecemeal, and miss the thread; but in point of fact it is just this very thread which it is so difficult to detect and retain from one chapter to another.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/job/6.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/job/6-30.htm" title="Is there iniquity in my tongue? cannot my taste discern perverse things?">Job 6:30</a></span>. <span class="ital">Is there iniquity in my tongue? — </span>Consider, if there be any iniquity, or untruth, in what I have already said, or shall further speak?

This he compares to the failing of brooks in summer. Those who rest their expectations on the creature, will find it fail when it should help them; whereas those who make God their confidence, have help in the time of need, Heb 4:16. Those who make gold their hope, sooner or later will be ashamed of it, and of their confidence in it. It is our wisdom to cease from man. Let us put all our confidence in the Rock of ages, not in broken reeds; in the Fountain of life, not in broken cisterns. The application is very close; for now ye are nothing. It were well for us, if we had always such convictions of the vanity of the creature, as we have had, or shall have, on a sick-bed, a death-bed, or in trouble of conscience. Job upbraids his friends with their hard usage. Though in want, he desired no more from them than a good look and a good word. It often happens that, even when we expect little from man, we have less; but from God, even when we expect much, we have more. Though Job differed from them, yet he was ready to yield as soon as it was made to appear that he was in error. Though Job had been in fault, yet they ought not to have given him such hard usage. His righteousness he holds fast, and will not let it go. He felt that there had not been such iniquity in him as they supposed. But it is best to commit our characters to Him who keeps our souls; in the great day every upright believer shall have praise of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Is there iniquity in my tongue? - This is a solemn appeal to their consciences, and their own deep conviction that he was sincere. Iniquity in the tongue means falsehood, deceit, hypocrisy - that which would be expressed by the tongue.<p>Cannot my taste discern perverse things? - Margin, palate. The word used here &#1495;&#1498;  che&#770;k means properly the palate, together with the corresponding lower part of the mouth, the inside mouth. Gesenius. Hence, it means the organ of taste, residing in the mouth. The meaning is, that Job was qualified to discern what was true or false, sincere or hypocritical, just or unjust, in the same manner as the palate is fitted to discern the qualities of objects, whether bitter or sweet, pleasant or unpleasant, wholesome or unwholesome. His object is to invite attention to what he had to state on the subject. To this proposed vindication he proceeds in the following chapter, showing the greatness of his calamity, and his right, as he supposes, to complain. Their attention was gained. They did not refuse to listen to him, and he proceeds to a fuller statement of his calamity, and of the reasons why he had allowed himself to use the language of complaint. They listened without interruption until he was done, and then replied in tones of deeper severity still. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>30.

Meaning in his words; either those which he uttered when he cursed the day on which he was born, or in charging his friends with unkindness and falsehood; otherwise the tongue is a world of iniquity, and the best of men are apt to offend both God and men in word: <p>cannot my taste discern perverse things? which is to be understood not of his natural taste, which very probably through his disease might be greatly vitiated, and incapable of relishing his food as in time of health, and of distinguishing good from bad; but of his intellectual taste, or of his sense and reason, his rational and spiritual taste; he had his senses exercised to discern good and evil; he could distinguish between right and wrong that was said or done, either by himself or others; be had the use of his rational powers and faculties, and therefore not to be treated as a mad or distracted man, but as one capable of carrying on a conversation, of opening his true case, and defending himself; see <a href="/job/12-11.htm">Job 12:11</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Is there iniquity in my tongue? cannot my taste discern perverse things?</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/job/6.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">30</span>. In <span class="ital"><a href="/job/6-28.htm" title="Now therefore be content, look on me; for it is evident to you if I lie.">Job 6:28</a></span> Job asseverated that he spoke truth in affirming his innocence. In <span class="ital"><a href="/job/6-29.htm" title="Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yes, return again, my righteousness is in it.">Job 6:29</a></span> he affirmed that he had right on his side in his plea against God, in other words that he was wrongly afflicted. This verse, therefore, can hardly be a new assertion that he speaks the truth when he affirms his innocence; it must refer to a point further back, and be, in the form of a question, an affirmation of his ability to say whether he is innocent or not, and to judge rightly regarding the nature of his afflictions. The question, Is there iniquity in my tongue? means Is my tongue perverted that it cannot distinguish? In the second clause “taste” or “palate” is not referred to as an organ of speech but of perception (ch. <a href="/job/12-11.htm" title="Does not the ear try words? and the mouth taste his meat?">Job 12:11</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The expression “perverse things” may mean <span class="ital">wickednesses</span>. This may be used generally and the question in the second clause have the same meaning as that in the first, viz. whether Job had lost moral sense and could not distinguish wrong from right? And the whole would be an affirmation of the soundness of his moral judgments, meant to support the asseveration of his innocence and the righteousness of his cause (<span class="ital"><a href="/context/job/6-28.htm" title="Now therefore be content, look on me; for it is evident to you if I lie....">Job 6:28-29</a></span>). The phrase “perverse things” is that rendered “calamity” <span class="ital"><a href="/job/6-2.htm" title="Oh that my grief were thoroughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances together!">Job 6:2</a></span>, and this might be the meaning here: “cannot my taste discern calamities?” i. e. the true nature of my afflictions, and perceive that they are undeserved and unjust?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Either of the above meanings forms a fitting and pathetic transition to the renewed cry of despair in ch. 7. For that which makes Job’s condition so crushing to him is that though innocent he feels himself in the hands of a ruthless and arbitrary fate, which, regardless of his innocence, is bent on destroying him. For this fate he has no other name but God; cf. ch. <a href="/job/9-22.htm" title="This is one thing, therefore I said it, He destroys the perfect and the wicked.">Job 9:22</a> <span class="ital">seq</span>., <a href="/job/23-13.htm" title="But he is in one mind, and who can turn him? and what his soul desires, even that he does.">Job 23:13</a> <span class="ital">seq</span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Is there iniquity in my tongue?</span> (see ver. 26).

Job's ultimate verdict on himself is that he has "uttered that which he understood not" (<a href="/job/42-3.htm">Job 42:3</a>) - wherefore he "abhors himself, and repents in dust and ashes" (<a href="/job/42-6.htm">Job 42:6</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>24  Teach me, and I will be silent,<p>And cause me to understand wherein I have failed.<p>25  How forcible are words in accordance with truth!<p>But what doth reproof from you reprove?<p>26  Do you think to reprove words?<p>The words of one in despair belong to the wind.<p>27  Ye would even cast lots for the orphan,<p>And traffic about your friend.<p>&#1504;&#1502;&#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/6-25.htm">Job 6:25</a>, in the signification of &#1504;&#1502;&#1500;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468; (<a href="/psalms/119-103.htm">Psalm 119:103</a>), would suit very well: how smooth, delicate, sweet, are, etc. (Hirz., Ew., Schlottm.); but this meaning does not suit <a href="/job/16-3.htm">Job 16:3</a>.
