There is a gracious softness of heart, like that of Josiah, whose heart was tender, and trembled at the word of God: but this is meant of an afflictive and painful softness, which apprehends every thing that is present to be pressing, and every thing that is future to be threatening. <span class="ital">Because I was not cut off before the darkness — </span>Because God did not cut me off by death before these dark and dismal miseries came upon me.

Thus Job seems to be disposed to quarrel with God, because he did not die before his troubles; and yet, it is probable, that if, in the height of his prosperity, he had received a summons to the grave, he would have thought it hard. It may help to reconcile us to death, whenever it comes, to consider that we do not know from what evil we may be taken away. But when trouble is actually come upon us, it is folly to wish we had not lived to see it; and it is much better to look to God for grace, that we may be enabled to make the best of it; and to remember, amidst the darkness, that frequently <span class="ital">to the upright there ariseth </span>a marvellous <span class="ital">light in the darkness, </span>and that there is reserved for them a much more marvellous light after it. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/job/23.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>23:13-17 As Job does not once question but that his trials are from the hand of God, and that there is no such thing as chance, how does he account for them? The principle on which he views them is, that the hope and reward of the faithful servants of God are only laid up in another life; and he maintains that it is plain to all, that the wicked are not treated according to their deserts in this life, but often directly the reverse. But though the obtaining of mercy, the first-fruits of the Spirit of grace, pledges a God, who will certainly finish the work which he has began; yet the afflicted believer is not to conclude that all prayer and entreaty will be in vain, and that he should sink into despair, and faint when he is reproved of Him. He cannot tell but the intention of God in afflicting him may be to produce penitence and prayer in his heart. May we learn to obey and trust the Lord, even in tribulation; to live or die as he pleases: we know not for what good ends our lives may be shortened or prolonged.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For God maketh my heart soft - That is, "faint."

On this prominence of a separate notion after the manner of an antecedent. The Hiph. &#1492;&#1502;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, like &#1492;&#1496;&#1468;&#1492;, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/23-11.htm">Job 23:11</a>, and &#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1494;, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/4-21.htm">Proverbs 4:21</a>, is not causative, but simply active in signification. In <a href="/job/23-12.htm">Job 23:12</a> the question arises, whether &#1510;&#1508;&#1503; &#1502;&#1503; is one expression, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/17-4.htm">Job 17:4</a>, in the sense of "hiding from another," or whether &#1502;&#1503; is comparative. In the former sense Hirz. explains: I removed the divine will from the possible ascendancy of my own. But since &#1510;&#1508;&#1503; is familiar to the poet in the sense of preserving and laying by (&#1510;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;( y, treasures, <a href="/job/20-26.htm">Job 20:26</a>), it is more natural to explain, according to <a href="/psalms/119-11.htm">Psalm 119:11</a> : I kept the words (commands) of Thy mouth, i.e., esteemed them high and precious, more than my statute, i.e., more than what my own will prescribed for me.<p>(Note: Wetzstein arranges the significations of &#1510;&#1508;&#1503; as follows: - 1.((Beduin) intr. fut. i, to contain one's self, to keep still (hence in Hebr. to lie in wait), to be rapt in thought; conjug. II. c. acc. pers. to make any one thoughtful, irresolute. 2.((Hebr.) trans. fut. o, to keep anything to one's self, to hold back, to keep to one's self; Niph. to be held back, i.e., either concealed or reserved for future use. Thus we see how, on the one hand, &#1510;&#1508;&#1503; is related to &#1496;&#1502;&#1503;, e.g., <a href="/job/20-26.htm">Job 20:26</a> (Arab. itmaanna, to be still); and, on the other, can interchange with &#1510;&#1508;&#1492; in the signification designare (comp. <a href="/job/15-22.htm">Job 15:22</a> with <a href="/job/15-20.htm">Job 15:20</a>; <a href="/job/21-19.htm">Job 21:19</a>), and to spy, lie in wait (comp. <a href="/psalms/10-8.htm">Psalm 10:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/56-7.htm">Psalm 56:7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/1-11.htm">Proverbs 1:11</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/1-18.htm">Proverbs 1:18</a>, with <a href="/psalms/37-32.htm">Psalm 37:32</a>).)<p>The meaning is substantially the same; the lxx, which translates &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#837; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; (&#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1511;&#1497;), which Olsh. considers to be "perhaps correct," destroys the significance of the confession. Hirz. rightly refers to the "law in the members," <a href="/romans/7-23.htm">Romans 7:23</a> : &#1495;&#1511;&#1468;&#1497; is the expression Job uses for the law of the sinful nature which strives against the law of God, the wilful impulse of selfishness and evil passion, the law which the apostle describes as &#x3b5;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, in distinction from the &#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; (Psychol. S. 379). Job's conscience can give him this testimony, but He, the God who so studiously avoids him, remains in one mind, viz., to treat him as a criminal; and who can turn Him from His purpose? (the same question as <a href="/job/9-12.htm">Job 9:12</a>; <a href="/job/11-10.htm">Job 11:10</a>); His soul wills it (stat pro ratione voluntas), and He accomplishes it. Most expositors explain permanet in uno in this sense; the Beth is the usual &#1489; with verbs of entering upon and persisting in anything. Others, however, take the &#1489; as Beth essentiae: He remains one and the same, viz., in His conduct towards me (Umbr., Vaih.), or: He is one, is alone, viz., in absolute majesty (Targ. Jer.; Schult., Ew., Hlgst., Schlottm.), which is admissible, since this Beth occurs not only in the complements of a sentence (<a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/39-7.htm">Psalm 39:7</a>, like a shadow; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/48-10.htm">Isaiah 48:10</a>, after the manner of silver; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/55-19.htm">Psalm 55:19</a>, in great number; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/35-2.htm">Psalm 35:2</a>, as my help), but also with the predicate of a simple sentence, be it verbal (<a href="/job/24-13.htm">Job 24:13</a>; <a href="/proverbs/3-26.htm">Proverbs 3:26</a>) or substantival (<a href="/exodus/18-4.htm">Exodus 18:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/118-7.htm">Psalm 118:7</a>). The same construction is found also in Arabic, where, however, it is more frequent in simple negative clauses than in affirmative (vid., Psalter, i. 272). The assertion: He is one (as in the primary monotheistic confession, <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>), is, however, an expression for the absoluteness of God, which is not suited to this connection; and if &#1492;&#1493;&#1488; &#1489;&#1488;&#1495;&#1491; is intended to be understood of the unchangeable uniformity of His purpose concerning Job, the explanation: versatur (perstat) in uno, Arab. hua fi wa&#770;hidin, is not only equally, but more natural, and we therefore prefer it.<p>continued...</body></html>
