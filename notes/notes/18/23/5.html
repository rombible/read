He wants to have his cause tried quickly. Blessed be God, we may know where to find him. He is in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself; and upon a mercy-seat, waiting to be gracious. Thither the sinner may go; and there the believer may order his cause before Him, with arguments taken from his promises, his covenant, and his glory. A patient waiting for death and judgment is our wisdom and duty, and it cannot be without a holy fear and trembling. A passionate wishing for death or judgement is our sin and folly, and ill becomes us, as it did Job.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I would know the words which he would answer me - That is, I wish to understand what would be "his" decision in the case - and what would be his judgment in regard to me. That was of infinitely more importance than any opinion which "man" could form, and Job was anxious to have the matter decided by a tribunal which could not err. Why should "we" not desire to know exactly what God thinks of us, and what estimate he has formed of our character? There is no information so valuable to us as that would be; for on "his" estimate hangs our eternal doom, and yet there is nothing which people more instinctively dread than to know what God thinks of their character. It would be well for each one to ask himself, "Why is it so?" <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/23.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. he&#8212;emphatic: it little matters what man may say of me, if only I know what God judges of me.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/job/23.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> I long to know what he would say, either to prove me a hypocrite, or to justify his harsh proceedings against me; and if be should discover to me any secret and unknown sins, for which he contendeth with me, I should humble myself before him, and accept of the punishment of mine iniquity. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/job/23.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>I would know the words which he would answer me,....
