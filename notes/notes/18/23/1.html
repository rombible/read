The passage from this to the end of the 10th verse is peculiarly fine, and well worthy of the reader’s deep attention. In it Job fully answers the charge of Eliphaz concerning his denial or disbelief of the Divine Providence; and observes, that this was so far from being the case, that there was nothing he so much lamented as that he was excluded from God’s presence, and not permitted to draw near and make his defence before him; having the testimony of his own conscience respecting his integrity, and not doubting but he should make his cause good. He then shows, that his cause was far from being singular, for that many other dispensations of God’s providence were equally difficult to be accounted for, at least by human understanding; and that it was this which filled him with greater apprehensions. He expresses his desire that God, in the course of his providence, would make a more visible distinction between the righteous and the wicked in this world, that good men might not fall into such mistakes in censuring suffering innocence. He concludes with showing what, according to their principles, ought to be the general course of providence with regard to wicked men, which, however, it was notorious was not the case: and since it was not, it was plain that he had proved his point, and the falsity of their maxim was apparent: and their censuring him merely for his sufferings was a behaviour by no means justifiable. — Heath.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/job/23.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>23:1-7 Job appeals from his friends to the just judgement of God. He wants to have his cause tried quickly. Blessed be God, we may know where to find him. He is in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself; and upon a mercy-seat, waiting to be gracious. Thither the sinner may go; and there the believer may order his cause before Him, with arguments taken from his promises, his covenant, and his glory. A patient waiting for death and judgment is our wisdom and duty, and it cannot be without a holy fear and trembling. A passionate wishing for death or judgement is our sin and folly, and ill becomes us, as it did Job.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He shall deliver the island of the innocent - Margin, "the innocent shall deliver the island." Never was there a more unhappy translation than this; and it is quite clear that our translators had no intelligible idea of the meaning of the passage. What can be meant by "saving the island of the innocent?" The word rendered island (&#1488;&#1497;  '&#305;&#770;y) commonly means, indeed, an island, or a maritime country; see <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/20-6.htm">Isaiah 20:6</a>, note. It is, however, used as a "negative" in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-21.htm">1 Samuel 4:21</a>, in the name "I-chabod" - &#1488;&#1497;&#1470;&#1499;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491;  '&#305;&#770;y-ka&#770;bo&#770;d. "And she named the child I-chabod (margin, that is, "where is the glory?" or, there is "no glory"), saying, the glory is departed from Israel." This sense is frequent in the Rabbinic Hebrew, where it is used as connected with an adjective in a privative sense, like the English "un." It is probably an abbreviated form of (&#1488;&#1497;&#1503;  'ay&#305;&#770;n) "not, nothing;" and is used here as a "negative" to qualify the following word, "He shall deliver even him that is not innocent."<p>So it is rendered by the Chaldee, by Le Clerc, Rosenmuller, Gesenius, Noyes, and others. The Vulgate and the Septuagint render it, "He shall deliver the innocent." The sense is, that the man who returns to God, and who is regarded by him as his friend, will be able to intercede for the guilty, and to save them from the punishment which they deserved. His prayers and intercessions will be heard in their behalf, and on his account layouts will be shown to them, even when they did not personally deserve them. This sentiment accords with that expressed in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/18-26.htm">Genesis 18:26</a>, "If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes;" <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-14.htm">Ezekiel 14:14</a>, "Though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job were in it, they should deliver but their own souls;" compare <a href="/ezekiel/22-30.htm">Ezekiel 22:30</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/5-1.htm">Jeremiah 5:1</a>. The sentiment, also, had a beautiful illustration, though one which Eliphaz did not here think of, in his own case and that of his friends, where this very Job, to whom he was giving this counsel, was directed to intercede for them; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/42-7.htm">Job 42:7-8</a>. The sentiment, indeed, is found every where in the Scriptures, that the righteous are permitted to pray for others, and that they are thus the means of bringing down important blessings on them. In answer to those prayers, multitudes are saved from calamity here, and will be brought to eternal life hereafter.<p>And it is delivered by the pureness of thine hands - Or, rather, he, i. e., the wicked, for whom you pray, will be delivered by the pureness of thine hands. That is, God will save him in answer to the prayers of a righteous man. Your upright and holy life; your pure hands stretched out in supplication, shall be the means of saving him. No one can tell how many blessings are conferred on wicked people because the righteous pray for them. No one can tell how many a wicked son is spared, and ultimately saved, in answer to the intercessions of a holy parent; nor can the wicked world yet know how much it owes its preservation, and the numberless blessings which it enjoys, to the intercessions of the saints. It is one of the innumerable blessings of being a child of God thus to be permitted to be the means of bringing down blessings on others, and saving sinners from ruin. All the friends of God may thus confer unspeakable benefits to others; and they who have "an interest at the throne of grace" should plead without ceasing for the salvation of guilty and dying people. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/23.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 23<p>THIRD SERIES.<p>Job 23:1-17.

He begins by justifying the vehemence of his complaints, first, on the ground of the severity of his sufferings (ver. 2), and secondly, on the ground of his conviction that, if God would bring him to an open trial before his tribunal, he would acquit him (vers. 3-12). By the way, he complains that God hides himself, and cannot be found (vers. 3, 8, 9). He then further complains that God is not to be bent from his purpose, which is set against Job (vers. 13-17). In ch. 24. he goes over ground already trodden, maintaining the general prosperity of the wicked, and their exemption from any special earthly punishment (vers. 2-24). He winds up, finally, with a challenge to his opponents to disprove the truth of what he has said (ver. 25). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1, 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then Job answered and said, Even to-day is my complaint bitter</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> even to-day, notwithstanding all that has been said by my opponents against my right to complain, I do complain, and as bitterly as ever.

The promissory &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; is surrounded by conditional clauses, for <a href="/job/22-23.htm">Job 22:23</a> (comp. <a href="/job/11-14.htm">Job 11:14</a>) is a second conditional clause still under the government of &#1488;&#1501;, which is added for embellishment; it opens the statement of that in which penitence must be manifested, if it is to be thorough. The lxx translates &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#834;&#837;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#837;&#x3c2;, i.e., &#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1504;&#1492;, which Ewald considers as the original; the omission of the &#1488;&#1501; (which the poet otherwise in such connections has formerly heaped up, e.g., <a href="/job/8-5.htm">Job 8:5</a>., <a href="/job/11-13.htm">Job 11:13</a>) is certainly inconvenient. And yet we should not on that account like to give up the figure indicated in &#1514;&#1489;&#1504;&#1492;, which is so beautiful and so suited to our poet. The statement advanced in the latter conditional clause is then continued in <a href="/job/22-24.htm">Job 22:24</a> in an independent imperative clause, which the old versions regard as a promise instead of exhortation, and therefore grossly misinterpret. The Targ. translates: and place on the dust a strong city (i.e., thou shalt then, where there is now nothing but dust, raise up such), as if &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1512; could be equivalent to &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1503; or &#1502;&#1489;&#1510;&#1512;, - a rendering to which Saadia at least gives a turn which accords with the connection: "regard the stronghold (Arab. 'l-h&#803;s&#803;n) as dust, and account as the stones of the valleys the gold of Ophir;" better than Eichhorn: "pull down thy stronghold of violence, and demolish (&#1492;&#1508;&#1497;&#1512;) the castles of thy valleys." On the other hand, Gecatilia, who understands &#1489;&#1510;&#1512; proportionately more correctly of treasures, translates it as a promise: so shalt thou inherit treasures (Arab. dcha&#770;yr) more numerous than dust, and gold ore (Arab. tbr') (more than) the stones of the valleys; and again also Rosenm. (repones prae pulvere argentum) and Welte interpret <a href="/job/22-24.htm">Job 22:24</a> as a promise; whereas other expositors, who are true to the imperative &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514;, explain &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514; ni aestimare, and &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1506;&#1508;&#1512; pulveris instar (Grot., Cocc., Schult., Dathe, Umbr.), by falsely assigning to &#1506;&#1500; here, as to &#1500; elsewhere, a meaning which it never has anywhere; how blind, on the other hand, since the words in their first meaning, pone super pulverem, furnish an excellent thought which is closely connected with the admonition to rid one's self of unjust possessions. &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1512;, like Arab. tibr (by which Abulwalid explains it), is gold and silver ore, i.e., gold and silver as they are broken out of the mine, therefore (since silver is partially pure, gold almost pure, and always containing more or less silver) the most precious metal in its pure natural state before being worked, and consequently also unalloyed (comp. Arab. nd&#803;&#305;&#770;r and nud&#803;a&#770;r, which likewise signifies aurum argentumve nativum, but not ab excidendo, but a nitore); and "to lay in the dust" is equivalent to, to part with a thing as entirely worthless and devoid of attraction. The meaning is therefore: put away from thee the idol of previous metal with contempt (comp. <a href="/isaiah/2-20.htm">Isaiah 2:20</a>), which is only somewhat differently expressed in the parallel: lay the Ophir under the quartz (&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; agreeing with &#1489;&#1510;&#1512;) of the brooks (such as is found in the beds of empty wdys), i.e., place it under the rubble, after it has lost for thee its previous bewitching spell.

The matter is still not settled.)<p>is directly called &#1488;&#1493;&#1508;&#1497;&#1512;. When Job thus casts from him temporal things, by the excessive cherishing of which he has hitherto sinned, then God himself will be his imperishable treasure, his everlasting higher delight.

This is what the contrast of the plur.

The Targ. translates it &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1493;&#1507; &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1488;, and accordingly it is explained by both &#1495;&#1505;&#1503; (strength) and &#1490;&#1489;&#1492; (height), without any reason being assigned for these significations.

Accordingly, we must go back to the root &#1493;&#1507;, &#1497;&#1507;, discussed on <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/95-4.htm">Psalm 95:4</a>, which signifies to rise aloft, to be high, and from which &#1497;&#1508;&#1506;, or with a transposition of the consonants &#1497;&#1506;&#1507; (comp. &#1506;&#1497;&#1507; and &#1497;&#1506;&#1507;), acquires the signification of standing out, rising radiantly, shining afar off, since &#1497;&#1506;&#1507;, to become weary, is allied to the Arab. wgf, fut. i; this &#1497;&#1506;&#1507; (&#1497;&#1508;&#1506;), on the other hand, to Arab. yf', ascendere, adolescere, Arab. wf&#8219;, elatum, adultum esse, and Arab. wfa&#770;, eminere, and tropically completum, perfectum esse. Thus we obtain the signification enimentiae for &#1514;&#1493;&#1506;&#1508;&#1493;&#1514;. In <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/95-4.htm">Psalm 95:4</a>, as a numerical plur., it signifies the towerings (tops) of the mountains, and here, as in the passages cited from Numbers, either prominent, eminent attributes, or as an intensive plur. excellence; whence, agreeing with Ewald, we have translated "silver of the brightest lustre" (comp. &#1497;&#1508;&#1506;&#1492;, eminentia, splendor, <a href="/ezekiel/28-7.htm">Ezekiel 28:7</a>). </body></html>
