He wants to have his cause tried quickly. Blessed be God, we may know where to find him. He is in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself; and upon a mercy-seat, waiting to be gracious. Thither the sinner may go; and there the believer may order his cause before Him, with arguments taken from his promises, his covenant, and his glory. A patient waiting for death and judgment is our wisdom and duty, and it cannot be without a holy fear and trembling. A passionate wishing for death or judgement is our sin and folly, and ill becomes us, as it did Job.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I would order my cause before him - Compare the notes at <a href="/isaiah/43-26.htm">Isaiah 43:26</a>.

Job has put away the feelings of shame and diffidence, which were predominant with him when he said, "How should man be just with God? If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand" (<a href="/job/9-2.htm">Job 9:2, 3</a>); and again, "How much less shall I answer him, and cheese out my words to reason with him? Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer; but I would make my supplication to my Judge" (<a href="/job/9-14.htm">Job 9:14, 15</a>). He now wishes to contend and argue and reason. This is quite in accordance with our experience. Many am the moods of man - various and conflicting his desires! His mind never continues long in one stay. <span class="cmt_word">And fill my mouth with arguments</span> (comp. <a href="/psalms/38-14.htm">Psalm 38:14</a>, where our translators render the same word by "reproofs," but where "arguments" or "pleadings" would be more appropriate).

If he prays to Him (&#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512; may be thus regarded as the antecedent of a conditional clause, like &#1497;&#1489;&#1512;&#1495;, <a href="/job/20-24.htm">Job 20:24</a>), He will hear him; and what he has vowed in prayer he will now, after that which he supplicated is granted, thankfully perform; the Hiph. &#1492;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512; (according to its etymon: to offer the incense of prayer) occurs only in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/8.htm">Exodus 8-10</a> beside this passage, whereas &#1490;&#1468;&#1494;&#1512; (to cut in pieces, cut off) occurs here for the first time in the signification, to decide, resolve, which is the usual meaning of the word in the later period of the language.

That which he designs (&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;) is successful, and is realized, and light shines upon his ways, so that he cannot stumble and does not miss his aim, - light like moonlight or morning light; for, as the author of the introductory Proverbs, to which we have already so often referred as being borrowed from the book of Job (comp. <a href="/job/21-24.htm">Job 21:24</a> with <a href="/proverbs/3-8.htm">Proverbs 3:8</a>), ingeniously says, ch. <a href="/job/4-18.htm">Job 4:18</a> : "The path of the righteous is as the morning light (&#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1512; &#1504;&#1490;&#1492;&#1468;, comp. <a href="/daniel/6-20.htm">Daniel 6:20</a>), which shineth brighter and brighter into the height of day (i.e., noonday brightness)."</body></html>
