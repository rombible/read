The victim of an ever present paradox and dilemma; afraid of God, yet longing to see Him; conscious of His presence, yet unable to find Him; assured of His absolute justice, and yet convinced of his own suffering innocence. His history, in fact, to the Old World was what the Gospel is to the New: the exhibition of a perfectly righteous man, yet made perfect through suffering. It was therefore an effort, at the solution of the problem of the reconciliation of the inequality of life with the justice of God.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/job/23.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>23:13-17 As Job does not once question but that his trials are from the hand of God, and that there is no such thing as chance, how does he account for them? The principle on which he views them is, that the hope and reward of the faithful servants of God are only laid up in another life; and he maintains that it is plain to all, that the wicked are not treated according to their deserts in this life, but often directly the reverse. But though the obtaining of mercy, the first-fruits of the Spirit of grace, pledges a God, who will certainly finish the work which he has began; yet the afflicted believer is not to conclude that all prayer and entreaty will be in vain, and that he should sink into despair, and faint when he is reproved of Him. He cannot tell but the intention of God in afflicting him may be to produce penitence and prayer in his heart. May we learn to obey and trust the Lord, even in tribulation; to live or die as he pleases: we know not for what good ends our lives may be shortened or prolonged.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Therefore am I troubled at his presence - The doctrine of divine purposes and decrees "is fitted to impress the mind with awe." So vast are the plans of God; so uncertain to us is it what will be developed next; so impossible is it to resist God when he comes forth to execute his plans, that they fill the mind with reverence and fear. And this is one of the objects for which the doctrine is revealed. It is designed to rebuke the soul that is filled with flippancy and self-conceit; to impress the hcart with adoring views of God, and to secure a proper reverence for his government. Not knowing what may be the next development of his plan, the mind should be in a state of holy fear - yet ready to submit and bow in whatever aspect his purposes may be made known. A Being, who has an eternal plan, and who is able to accomplish all that he purposes, and who makes known none of his dealings beforehand, should be an object of veneration and fear. It will not be the same "kind of dreadful fear" which we would have of one who had almighty power, but who had "no plan" of any kind, but profound veneration for one who is infinitely wise as well as almighty. The fear of an Almighty Being, who has an eternal plan, which we cannot doubt is wise, though it is inscrutable to us, is a fear mingled with confidence; it is awe leading to the profoundest veneration. His eternal counsels may take away "our" comforts, but they are right; his coming forth may fill us with awe, but we shall venerate and love him.<p>When I consider - When I endeavor to understand his dealings; or when I think closely on them.<p>I am afraid of him - This would be the effect on any mind. A man that will sit down alone and "think" of God, and on his vast plans, will see that there is abundant occasion to be in awe before him. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/23.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15.

We here decide in favour of the temporal signification, against Rosenm., Schlottm., and Hahn; for if &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; be understood locally, a "then" must be supplied, and it may therefore be concluded that this &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; is the expression for it. We assume at the same time that &#1504;&#1493;&#1499;&#1495; is correctly pointed as part. with Kametz; accordingly it is to be explained: then, if He would thus pay attention to me, an upright man would be contending with Him, i.e., then it would be satisfactorily proved that an upright man may contend with Him. In <a href="//biblehub.com/job/23-7.htm">Job 23:7</a>, &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1496;, like &#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1496;, <a href="/job/20-20.htm">Job 20:20</a> (comp. &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1495;, to have open, to stand open), is intensive of Kal: I should for ever escape my judge, i.e., come off most completely free from unmerited punishment. Thus it ought to be if God could be found, but He cannot be found. The &#1492;&#1503;, which according to the sense may be translated by "yet" (comp. <a href="/job/21-16.htm">Job 21:16</a>), introduces this antithetical relation: Yet I go towards the east (&#1492;&#1503; with Mahpach, &#1511;&#1491;&#1501; with Munach), and He is not there; and towards the west (&#1488;&#1495;&#1493;&#1512;, comp. &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, occidentales, <a href="/job/18-20.htm">Job 18:20</a>), and perceive Him not (expressed as in <a href="/job/9-11.htm">Job 9:11</a>; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503; &#1500; elsewhere: to attend to anything, <a href="/job/14-21.htm">Job 14:21</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/32-29.htm">Deuteronomy 32:29</a>; <a href="/psalms/73-17.htm">Psalm 73:17</a>; here, as there, to perceive anything, so that &#1500;&#1493; is equivalent to &#1488;&#1514;&#1493;). In <a href="/job/23-9.htm">Job 23:9</a> the left (&#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1488;&#1493;&#1500;, Arab. shema&#770;l, or even without the substantival termination, on which comp. Jesurun, pp. 222-227, sham, sha&#770;m) is undoubtedly an appellation of the north, and the right (&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1503;, Arab. jem&#780;&#770;n) an appellation of the south; both words are locatives which outwardly are undefined. And if the usual signification of &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; and &#1506;&#1496;&#1507; are retained, it is to be explained thus: northwards or in the north, if He should be active - I behold not; if He veil himself southwards or in the south - I see not. This explanation is also satisfactory so far as <a href="/job/23-9.htm">Job 23:9</a> is concerned, so that it is unnecessary to understand &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1514;&#1493; other than in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/28-26.htm">Job 28:26</a>, and with Blumenfeld to translate according to the phrase &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1491;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;, <a href="/judges/17-8.htm">Judges 17:8</a> : if He makes His way northwards; or even with Umbr. to call in the assistance of the Arab. gs&#780;a&#770; (to cover), which neither here nor <a href="/job/9-9.htm">Job 9:9</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/15-27.htm">Job 15:27</a>, is admissible, since even then &#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1488;&#1493;&#1500; &#1489;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1514;&#1493; cannot signify: if He hath concealed himself on the left hand (in the north). Ewald's combination of &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; with &#1506;&#1496;&#1492;, in the assumed signification "to incline to" of the latter, is to be passed over as useless. On the other hand, much can be said in favour of Ewald's translation of <a href="/job/23-9.htm">Job 23:9</a>: "if He turn to the right hand - I see Him not;" for (1) the Arab. gt&#803;f, by virtue of the radical notion,<p>(Note: The Arab. verb &#8219;t&#803;f signifies trans. to turn, or lay, anything round, so that it is laid or drawn over something else and covers it; hence Arab. &#8219;t&#803;a&#770;f, a garment that is cast round one, Arab. ta&#8219;at&#803;t&#803;afa with Arab. b of a garment: to cast it or wrap it about one. Intrans. to turn aside, depart from, of deviating from a given direction, deflectere, declinare; also, to turn in a totally opposite direction, to turn one's self round and to go back. - Fl.)<p>which is also traceable in the Heb. &#1506;&#1496;&#1507;, signifies both trans. and intrans. to turn up, bend aside; (2) Saadia translates: "and if He turns southwards (&#8219;atafa gunu&#770;ban);" (3) Schultens correctly observes: &#1506;&#1496;&#1507; significatione operiendi commodum non efficit sensum, nam quid mirum is quem occultantem se non conspiciamus. We therefore give the preference to this Arabic rendering of &#1497;&#1506;&#1496;&#1507;. If &#1497;&#1506;&#1496;&#1507;, in the sense of obvelat se, does not call to mind the &#1495;&#1491;&#1512;&#1497; &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1503;, penetralia austri, <a href="/job/9-9.htm">Job 9:9</a> (comp. Arab. chidr, velamen, adytum), neither will &#1489;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1514;&#1493; point to the north as the limit of the divine dominion. Such conceptions of the extreme north and south are nowhere found among the Arabs as among the Arian races (vid., <a href="/isaiah/14-13.htm">Isaiah 14:13</a>); <p>(Note: In contrast to the extreme north, the abode of the gods, the habitation of life, the extreme south is among the Arians the abode of the prince of death and of demons, Jama (vid., p. 421) with his attendants, and therefore the habitation of death.)<p>and, moreover, the conception of the north as the abode of God cannot be shown to be biblical, either from <a href="/job/37-22.htm">Job 37:22</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-4.htm">Ezekiel 1:4</a>, or still less from <a href="/psalms/48-3.htm">Psalm 48:3</a>. With regard to the syntax, &#1497;&#1506;&#1496;&#1507; is a hypothetical fut., as <a href="/job/20-24.htm">Job 20:24</a>; <a href="/job/22-27.htm">Job 22:27</a>. The use of the fut. apoc. &#1488;&#1495;&#1494;, like &#1488;&#1496;, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/23-11.htm">Job 23:11</a>, without a voluntative or aoristic signification, is poetic. Towards all quarters of the heavens he turns, i.e., with his eyes and the longing of his whole nature, if he may by any means find God. But He evades him, does not reveal Himself in any place whatever.<p>The &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; which now follows does not give the reason of Job's earnest search after God, but the reason of His not being found by him. He does not allow Himself to be seen anywhere; He conceals Himself from him, lest He should be compelled to acknowledge the right of the sufferer, and to withdraw His chastening hand from him. </body></html>
