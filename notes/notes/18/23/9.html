His views were all gloomy. God seemed to stand at a distance, and frown upon him. Yet Job expressed his assurance that he should be brought forth, tried, and approved, for he had obeyed the precepts of God. He had relished and delighted in the truths and commandments of God. Here we should notice that Job justified himself rather than God, or in opposition to him, ch. 32:2. Job might feel that he was clear from the charges of his friends, but boldly to assert that, though visited by the hand of God, it was not a chastisement of sin, was his error. And he is guilty of a second, when he denies that there are dealings of Providence with men in this present life, wherein the injured find redress, and the evil are visited for their sins.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>On the left hand - That is, in the North - at the left hand when the face was turned to the East. So the Chaldee, &#1489;&#1510;&#1508;&#1493;&#1504;&#1488; - "on the North." The other versions, the Vulgate, the Septuagint, the Syriac, Castellio, Luther, etc., render it "on the left hand." The common term among the Hebrews for the "North" is &#1510;&#1508;&#1493;&#1503;  tsa&#770;pho&#770;n - (from &#1510;&#1508;&#1503;  tsa&#770;phan - "to hide," or "conceal"), meaning the hidden, concealed, or dark region, since the ancients regarded the North as the seat of gloom and darkness, (Homer, Odyssey ix. 25ff), while they supposed the South to be illuminated by the sun. "Gesenius." Frequently, however, as here, the word "left," or "left hand," is used. The region of the North is intended.<p>Where he doth work - Where there are such wonderful manifestations of his majesty and glory. May Job here not refer to the "Aurora Borealis," the remarkable display of the power of God which is seen in those regions? May he not have felt that there was some special reason why he might hope to meet with God in that quarter, or to see him manifest himself amidst the brilliant lights that play along the sky, as if to precede or accompany him? And when he had looked to the splendor of the rising sun, and the glory of his setting, in vain, was it not natural to turn his eye to the next remarkable manifestation, as he supposed, of God, in the glories of the Northern lights, and to expect to find him there? There is reason to think that the ancient Chaldeans, and other pagans, regarded the regions of the North, illuminated with these celestial splendors, as the special residence of the gods (see the notes at <a href="/isaiah/14-13.htm">Isaiah 14:13</a>), and it seems probable that Job may have had allusion to some such prevailing opinion.<p>But I cannot behold him - I can see the exhibition of remarkable splendor, but still "God" is unseen. He does not come amidst those glories to give me an opportunity to carry my cause before him. The meaning, then, of this is, "Disappointed in the East and the West. I turn to the North. There I have been accustomed to witness extraordinary manifestations of his magnificence and glory. There beautiful constellations circle the pole. There the Aurora plays, and seems to be the manifestation of the glory of God. Next to the glory of the rising and setting sun, I turn to those brilliant lights, to see if there I may not find my God, but in vain. Those lights are cold and chilly, and reveal no God to my soul. Disappointed, then I turn to the last point, the South, to see if I can find him there."<p>He hideth himself on the right hand - On the South. The South was to the ancients an unknown region. The deserts of Arabia, indeed, stretched away in that region, and they were partially known, and they had some knowledge that the sea was beyond. But they regarded the regions farther to the South, if there was land there, as wholly impassable and uninhabitable on account of the heat. The knowledge of geography was slowly acquired, and, of course, it is impossible to tell what were the views which prevailed on the subject in the time of Job. That there was little accuracy of information about remote countries must be regarded as an indisputable fact; and, probably, they had little conception of distant parts of the earth, except that formed by conjecture. Interesting details of the views of the ancients, on this subject, may be found in the Encyclopedia of Geography, vol. i. pp. 10-68; compare particularly the notes at <a href="/job/26-10.htm">Job 26:10</a>.<p>The earth was regarded as encompassed with waters, and the distant southern regions, on account of the impossibility of passing through the heat of the torrid zone, were supposed to be inaccessible. To those hidden and unknown realms, Job says he now turned, when he had in vain looked to each other quarter of the heavens, to see if he could find some manifestation of God. Yet he looked to that quarter equally in vain. God "hid" or "concealed" himself in those inaccessible regions so that he could not approach him. The meaning is, "I am also disappointed here. He hides himself in that distant land. In the burning and impassable wastes which stretch themselves to an unknown extent there, I cannot find him. The feet of mortals cannot traverse those burning plains, and there I cannot approach him. To whatever point of the compass I turn, I am left in equal darkness." What a striking description is this of the darkness that sometimes comes over the Christian's soul, prompting to the language, "O that I knew where I might find him! That I could come to his throne!" <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/23.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. Rather, "To the north."<p>work&#8212;God's glorious works are especially seen towards the north region of the sky by one in the northern hemisphere. The antithesis is between God working and yet not being beheld: as in Job 9:11, between "He goeth by," and "I see Him not." If the Hebrew bears it, the parallelism to the second clause is better suited by translating, as Umbreit, "doth hide himself"; but then the antithesis to "behold" would be lost.<p>right hand&#8212;"in the south."<p>hideth&#8212;appropriately, of the unexplored south, then regarded as uninhabitable because of its heat (see Job 34:29).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/job/23.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Where he doth work, </span> to wit, in a special and peculiar manner, more than in other parts of the world; for so indeed God did work in those parts which were northward from Job, because there mankind (among whom God delights to be and to work) were most numerous, and most ingenious to discern God’s works. There also was the seat of the Assyrian empire, which was eminent in Job’s time, and afterwards of the other successive empires; in and by all which God did many great and glorious works. But this Hebrew word is by others, and that very properly and fitly, rendered <span class="ital">when</span>, or <span class="ital">whilst, he worketh</span>, to wit, in an eminent manner.

The northern part of the world, where his seat is, or the circle of the earth, says Bar Tzemach, and who has stretched out the north over the empty place, <a href="/job/26-7.htm">Job 26:7</a>. Jarchi's note is, when he created it, he did not make it the place of his throne: God works everywhere in a way of providence, but in some places more eminently than in others; the northern part of the world is observed to be more inhabited than the southern, and the people of it to be more active in war and business than elsewhere; and more and greater things are done by God among them as instruments than among any other; and Mr. Caryl observes, that the Gospel has ever more generally and more clearly been preached here than in the southern parts of the world; and perhaps by the northern chambers in Ezekiel's vision, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-1.htm">Ezekiel 42:1</a>, were designed the Protestant churches in the northern parts, as it is well known the Protestant doctrine is called the northern heresy: but what Job meant by God's works in the north is not easy to say; but as this refers to some place where God had been used to work either in the way of providence or grace, it was the most likely one to find him in, and yet Job could not behold him, or get any sight of him, either as on a throne of grace or justice: <p>he hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him; or "he covereth the right hand" (h), the southern parts of the world; he covers the face of the south with his face, that I cannot see him, so Jarchi; this is said because the south is covered with the waters of the ocean, as Bar Tzemach observes; what we call the South sea: or rather the meaning is, that God covered himself on the right hand, or on the south, as with a garment, as the word signifies; wrapped himself up either in light inaccessible, as with a garment, or with clouds of darkness, that he could not be seen; and if he hides himself, as he often does from the best of men, who can behold him? <a href="/job/34-29.htm">Job 34:29</a>; see <a href="/job/9-11.htm">Job 9:11</a>. <p>(h)  "operiet dextram", Montanus, Junius &amp; Tremellius; so Cocceius, Drusius, Schmidt, Schultens, &amp; Broughton. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/23.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">On the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold him: he hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him:</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">On the left hand, where he doth work;</span> literally, <span class="accented">in his workshop.</span> There is an ellipse after "workshop" of some phrase like "I look for him."

Schlottm.). These interpretations are objectionable on account of the artificial restoration of the connection between the two members of the verse, which they require; they lead one to expect &#1493;&#1497;&#1491;&#1497; (as a circumstantial clause: lxx, Cod. Vat. &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#768;&#x3c1; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;). As the words stand, it is to be supposed that the definition of time, &#1490;&#1468;&#1501;&#1470;&#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1501; (even to-day still, as <a href="/zechariah/9-12.htm">Zechariah 9:12</a>), belongs to both divisions of the verse. How, then, is &#1502;&#1512;&#1497; to be understood? If we compare <a href="/job/7-11.htm">Job 7:11</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/10-1.htm">Job 10:1</a>, where &#1502;&#1512;, which is combined with &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1495;, signifies amarum  equals  amartiduo, it is natural to take &#1502;&#1512;&#1497; also in the signification amaritudo, acerbitas (Targ., Syr., Jer.); and this is also possible, since, as is evident from <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/23-21.htm">Exodus 23:21</a>, comp. <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/12-10.htm">Zechariah 12:10</a>, the verbal forms &#1502;&#1512;&#1512; and &#1502;&#1512;&#1492; run into one another, as they are really cognates.<p>(Note: &#1502;&#1512;&#1512; and &#1502;&#1512;&#1492; both spring from the root &#1502;&#1512; [vid. supra, p. 396, note], with the primary signification stringere, to beat, rub, draw tight. Hence Arab. ma&#770;rra&#770;, to touch lightly, smear upon (to go by, over, or through, to move by, etc.), but also stringere palatum, of an astringent taste, strong in taste, to be bitter, opp. Arab. h&#803;ala&#770;, soft and mild in taste, to be sweet, as in another direction &#1495;&#1500;&#1492;, to be loose, weak, sick, both from the root Arab. h&#803;l in h&#803;alla, solvit, laxavit. From the signification to be tight come amarra, to stretch tight, istamarra, to stretch one's self tight, to draw one's self out in this state of tension - of things in time, to continue unbroken; mirreh, string, cord; &#1502;&#1512;&#1492;, to make and hold one's self tight against any one, i.e., to be obstinate: originally of the body, as Arab. ma&#770;rra&#770;, tama&#770;rra&#770;, to strengthen themselves in the contest against one another; then of the mind, as Arab. ma&#770;ra&#770;, tama&#770;ra&#770;, to struggle against anything, both outwardly by contradiction and disputing, and inwardly by doubt and unbelief. - Fl.)<p>But it is more satisfactory, and more in accordance with the relation of the two divisions of the verse, if we keep to the usual signification of &#1502;&#1512;&#1497;; not, however, understanding it of obstinacy, revolt, rebellion (viz., in the sense of the friends), but, like moreh, <a href="/2_kings/14-26.htm">2 Kings 14:26</a>) which describes the affliction as stiff-necked, obstinate), of stubbornness, defiance, continuance in opposition, and explain with Raschi: My complaint is still always defiance, i.e., still maintains itself in opposition, viz., against God, without yielding (Hahn, Olsh.: unsubmitting); or rather: against such exhortations to penitence as those which Eliphaz has just addressed to him. In reply to these, Job considers his complain to be well justified even to-day, i.e., even now (for it is not, with Ewald, to be imagined that, in the mind of the poet, the controversy extends over several days, - an idea which would only be indicated by this one word).<p>In <a href="/job/23-2.htm">Job 23:2</a> he continues the same thought under a different form of expression. My hand lies heavy on my groaning, i.e., I hold it immoveably fast (as Fleischer proposes to take the words); or better: I am driven to a continued utterance of it.<p>(Note: The idea might also be: My hand presses my groaning back (because it would be of no use to me); but <a href="/job/23-2.htm">Job 23:2</a> is against this, and the Arab. kamada, to restrain inward pain, anger, etc. by force (e.g., ma&#770;t kemed, he died from suppressed rage or anxiety), has scarcely any etymological connection with &#1499;&#1489;&#1491;.)<p>continued...</body></html>
