The principle on which he views them is, that the hope and reward of the faithful servants of God are only laid up in another life; and he maintains that it is plain to all, that the wicked are not treated according to their deserts in this life, but often directly the reverse. But though the obtaining of mercy, the first-fruits of the Spirit of grace, pledges a God, who will certainly finish the work which he has began; yet the afflicted believer is not to conclude that all prayer and entreaty will be in vain, and that he should sink into despair, and faint when he is reproved of Him. He cannot tell but the intention of God in afflicting him may be to produce penitence and prayer in his heart. May we learn to obey and trust the Lord, even in tribulation; to live or die as he pleases: we know not for what good ends our lives may be shortened or prolonged.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Because I was not cut off before the darkness - Before these calamities came upon me. Because I was not taken away in the midst of prosperity, and while I was enjoying his smiles and the proofs of his love. His trouble is, that he was spared to pass through these trials, and to be treated as if he were one of the worst of men. This is what now perplexes him, and what he cannot understand. He does not know why God had reserved him to treat him as if he were the chief of sinners.<p>Neither hath he covered the darkness from my face - The word "neither" is supplied here by our translators, but not improperly. The difficulty with Job was, that God had not "hidden" this darkness and calamity so that he had not seen it. He could not understand why, since he was his friend, God had not taken him away, so that all should have seen, even in his death, that he was the friend of God. This feeling is not, perhaps, very uncommon among those who are called to pass through trials. They do not understand why they were reserved to these sufferings, and why God did not take them away before the billows of calamity rolled over them. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/23.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17.

That is, it was amazing to him, and troubled him when he thought of it, that he was not cut off by death, before the darkness of afflictions, or this dark dispensation came upon him; as sometimes righteous ones are taken from the evil to come, as Methuselah was before the flood, <a href="/genesis/5-27.htm">Genesis 5:27</a>; and Job wonders this was not his case, or at least he wishes it had been; for so Aben Ezra seems to understand and read the words, "why was I not cut off?" &amp;c. as if it was a wish, and expressive of his desire, that this had been done; which was what he had expostulated with God about at first, in the third chapter, and death was what he always desired, and still continued to wish for: or else the sense is, that he was amazed that he "was not cut off, because", "at", "through", or "by darkness" (b); by means of his afflictions; he wondered how he was supported under them, and carried through them, that they did not press him down to death; how such a poor wasted creature as he was, reduced to skin and bones, should ever be able to endure what he did; <p>neither hath he covered the darkness from my face; that I should not see and feel the afflictions I do; or rather, "he hath covered the darkness from my face", for the word "neither" is not in the text, though repeated by many interpreters from the foregoing clause; and then the sense is though I am sensible of the darkness of affliction upon me, yet he has covered it so from me, that I cannot see an end of it, or any way to escape out of it; or, which is the sense Drusius gives, he hath covered death and the grave from me, which is a state of darkness, a land of darkness, or darkness itself, as he calls <a href="/job/10-21.htm">Job 10:21</a>; that he could not see it, and enjoy it; he wished for death, but could not have it, it was hid from him. Cocceius renders the words very differently, he, that is, "God, hath covered himself with darkness from my face"; and interprets it of divine desertion, which troubled and terrified Job; and because he thus covered himself as it were with a cloud, this was the reason why he knew not where he was, and could not find him, when he made the most diligent search for him, and this grieved and astonished him, see <a href="/lamentations/3-44.htm">Lamentations 3:44</a>. <p>(b)  "propter tenebras", Pagninus, Piscator, Cocceius; so V.

This is the point in this whole speech, both in ch. 23 and ch. 24; Job misses any true moral rule in the world. The A. V. seems to make the enigma consist in this, that Job was not removed by death before such afflictions overtook him.

On this prominence of a separate notion after the manner of an antecedent. The Hiph. &#1492;&#1502;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, like &#1492;&#1496;&#1468;&#1492;, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/23-11.htm">Job 23:11</a>, and &#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1494;, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/4-21.htm">Proverbs 4:21</a>, is not causative, but simply active in signification. In <a href="/job/23-12.htm">Job 23:12</a> the question arises, whether &#1510;&#1508;&#1503; &#1502;&#1503; is one expression, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/17-4.htm">Job 17:4</a>, in the sense of "hiding from another," or whether &#1502;&#1503; is comparative. In the former sense Hirz. explains: I removed the divine will from the possible ascendancy of my own. But since &#1510;&#1508;&#1503; is familiar to the poet in the sense of preserving and laying by (&#1510;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;( y, treasures, <a href="/job/20-26.htm">Job 20:26</a>), it is more natural to explain, according to <a href="/psalms/119-11.htm">Psalm 119:11</a> : I kept the words (commands) of Thy mouth, i.e., esteemed them high and precious, more than my statute, i.e., more than what my own will prescribed for me.<p>(Note: Wetzstein arranges the significations of &#1510;&#1508;&#1503; as follows: - 1.((Beduin) intr. fut. i, to contain one's self, to keep still (hence in Hebr. to lie in wait), to be rapt in thought; conjug. II. c. acc. pers. to make any one thoughtful, irresolute. 2.((Hebr.) trans. fut. o, to keep anything to one's self, to hold back, to keep to one's self; Niph. to be held back, i.e., either concealed or reserved for future use. Thus we see how, on the one hand, &#1510;&#1508;&#1503; is related to &#1496;&#1502;&#1503;, e.g., <a href="/job/20-26.htm">Job 20:26</a> (Arab. itmaanna, to be still); and, on the other, can interchange with &#1510;&#1508;&#1492; in the signification designare (comp. <a href="/job/15-22.htm">Job 15:22</a> with <a href="/job/15-20.htm">Job 15:20</a>; <a href="/job/21-19.htm">Job 21:19</a>), and to spy, lie in wait (comp. <a href="/psalms/10-8.htm">Psalm 10:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/56-7.htm">Psalm 56:7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/1-11.htm">Proverbs 1:11</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/1-18.htm">Proverbs 1:18</a>, with <a href="/psalms/37-32.htm">Psalm 37:32</a>).)<p>The meaning is substantially the same; the lxx, which translates &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#837; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; (&#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1511;&#1497;), which Olsh. considers to be "perhaps correct," destroys the significance of the confession. Hirz. rightly refers to the "law in the members," <a href="/romans/7-23.htm">Romans 7:23</a> : &#1495;&#1511;&#1468;&#1497; is the expression Job uses for the law of the sinful nature which strives against the law of God, the wilful impulse of selfishness and evil passion, the law which the apostle describes as &#x3b5;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, in distinction from the &#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; (Psychol. S. 379). Job's conscience can give him this testimony, but He, the God who so studiously avoids him, remains in one mind, viz., to treat him as a criminal; and who can turn Him from His purpose? (the same question as <a href="/job/9-12.htm">Job 9:12</a>; <a href="/job/11-10.htm">Job 11:10</a>); His soul wills it (stat pro ratione voluntas), and He accomplishes it. Most expositors explain permanet in uno in this sense; the Beth is the usual &#1489; with verbs of entering upon and persisting in anything. Others, however, take the &#1489; as Beth essentiae: He remains one and the same, viz., in His conduct towards me (Umbr., Vaih.), or: He is one, is alone, viz., in absolute majesty (Targ. Jer.; Schult., Ew., Hlgst., Schlottm.), which is admissible, since this Beth occurs not only in the complements of a sentence (<a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/39-7.htm">Psalm 39:7</a>, like a shadow; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/48-10.htm">Isaiah 48:10</a>, after the manner of silver; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/55-19.htm">Psalm 55:19</a>, in great number; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/35-2.htm">Psalm 35:2</a>, as my help), but also with the predicate of a simple sentence, be it verbal (<a href="/job/24-13.htm">Job 24:13</a>; <a href="/proverbs/3-26.htm">Proverbs 3:26</a>) or substantival (<a href="/exodus/18-4.htm">Exodus 18:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/118-7.htm">Psalm 118:7</a>). The same construction is found also in Arabic, where, however, it is more frequent in simple negative clauses than in affirmative (vid., Psalter, i. 272). The assertion: He is one (as in the primary monotheistic confession, <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>), is, however, an expression for the absoluteness of God, which is not suited to this connection; and if &#1492;&#1493;&#1488; &#1489;&#1488;&#1495;&#1491; is intended to be understood of the unchangeable uniformity of His purpose concerning Job, the explanation: versatur (perstat) in uno, Arab. hua fi wa&#770;hidin, is not only equally, but more natural, and we therefore prefer it.<p>continued...</body></html>
