But surely there is no necessity, from the words themselves, to suppose any allusion of this kind, or, indeed, any thing miraculous, since God, by throwing a thick cloud over the sun and stars, can and does obscure them when he pleases.” — Dodd. And things in the Scriptures are often said <span class="ital">to be </span>or <span class="ital">not to be, </span>when they appear or disappear; of which some instances have been given in the former part of this work, and we shall have more hereafter in their proper places. Thus it is that the Chaldee Paraphrast understands the passage. <span class="ital">And sealeth up the stars — </span>That is, covereth and shutteth them up, that they may not shine, as in dark and dismal tempests, like that mentioned <a href="/acts/27-20.htm" title="And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no small tempest lay on us, all hope that we should be saved was then taken away.">Acts 27:20</a>, when <span class="ital">neither sun nor stars appeared for many days.</span><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/job/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:1-13 In this answer Job declared that he did not doubt the justice of God, when he denied himself to be a hypocrite; for how should man be just with God? Before him he pleaded guilty of sins more than could be counted; and if God should contend with him in judgment, he could not justify one out of a thousand, of all the thoughts, words, and actions of his life; therefore he deserved worse than all his present sufferings. When Job mentions the wisdom and power of God, he forgets his complaints. We are unfit to judge of God's proceedings, because we know not what he does, or what he designs. God acts with power which no creature can resist. Those who think they have strength enough to help others, will not be able to help themselves against it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades,<p>Or loose the bands of Orion?<p>Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season,<p>Or lead forth the Bear with her young?<p>Knowest thou the laws of the heavens,<p>Or hast thou appointed their dominion over the earth?<p><a href="/job/9-7.htm">Job 9:7</a>Which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not - Schultens supposes that all this is a description of the deluge - when the mountains were removed, when the fountains of the deep were broken up, and when the sun was obscured and seemed not to rise. Others have supposed that it refers to the fact that the sun is darkened by clouds and tempests, and appears not to rise and shine upon the earth. Others suppose that the allusion is to an eclipse; and others, that it is to the power of God, and means that the rising of the sun depends on him, and that if he should choose to give the command, the heavenly bodies would rise and give light no more. It seems probable that the meaning is, that God has power to do this; that the rising of the sun depends on him; and that he could delay it, or prevent it, at his pleasure. His power over the sun was shown in the time of Joshua, when, at his command, it stood still; but it is not necessary to suppose that there is any reference to this fact here. The whole meaning of the language is met by the supposition that it refers to the power of God, and affirms what he could do, or if it refer to any fact that had been observed, that the allusion is to the darkening of the sun by an eclipse or a tempest. No argument can be derived, therefore, from the expression, in regard to the age of the book.<p>And sealeth up the stars - The word "seal" in the Scriptures (&#1495;&#1514;&#1501;  cha&#770;tham) is used with considerable latitude of signification. It is employed in the sense of shutting, closing, making fast - as when anything was sealed, it was shut up or made fast. The Hebrews often used a seal, where we would use a lock, and depended on the protection derived from the belief that one would not break open that which was sealed, where we are obliged to rely on the security of the lock against force. If there were honor and honesty among people everywhere, a seal would be as secure as a lock - as in a virtuous community a sealed letter is as secure as a merchant's iron "safe." To "seal up the stars," means so to shut them up in the heavens, as to prevent their shining; to hide them from the view. They are concealed, hidden, made close - as the contents of a letter, a package, or a room are by a seal, indicating that no one is to examine them, and concealing them from the view. So God hides from our view the stars by the interposition of clouds. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7.

Of what God actually doth; and that either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. Ordinarily; and so he gives laws to the sun that it shall not rise, but at such times, and to such places, and in such manner as he hath appointed; as that it shall rise constantly at its set time, and never disorderly; that it shall not rise for divers months together in some parts of the world, &c. Or rather, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. Extraordinarily; (for of such works of God he discourseth in this place;) and so it may note either some stop given to the sun for a small season, like that in Joshua’s time; which might have been, though it be not recorded; or some extraordinary tempest or dark season, wherein <span class="ital">the morning is made darkness</span>, as the phrase is, <span class="bld"><a href="/amos/4-13.htm" title="For, see, he that forms the mountains, and creates the wind, and declares to man what is his thought, that makes the morning darkness, and treads on the high places of the earth, The LORD, The God of hosts, is his name.">Amos 4:13</a></span>; compare <span class="bld"><a href="/amos/5-8.htm" title="Seek him that makes the seven stars and Orion, and turns the shadow of death into the morning, and makes the day dark with night: that calls for the waters of the sea, and pours them out on the face of the earth: The LORD is his name:">Amos 5:8</a></span>; wherein the sun doth not at all appear, (as it was for many days together, <span class="bld"><a href="/acts/27-20.htm" title="And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no small tempest lay on us, all hope that we should be saved was then taken away.">Acts 27:20</a></span>) and consequently is to those places and persons as if he were not risen.

A magnificent idea of God's power, and, of course, quite true. All the movements of the earth and of the heavenly bodies are movements which God causes, and could at any moment suspend. The sun only rises upon the earth each day because God causes it to rise. If he were once to intermit his hand, the whole universe would fall into confusion. <span class="cmt_word">And sealeth up the stars</span>. Either covers them with a thick darkness, which their rays cannot penetrate, or otherwise renders them invisible.

The chief thought of Bildad's speech was, that God does not pervert what is right. Certainly (&#1488;&#1502;&#1504;&#1501;, scilicet, nimirum, like <a href="/job/12-2.htm">Job 12:2</a>), - says Job, as he ironically confirms this maxim of Bildad's, - it is so: what God does is always right, because God does it; how could man maintain that he is in the right in opposition to God! If God should be willing to enter into controversy with man, he would not be able to give Him information on one of a thousand subjects that might be brought into discussion; he would be so confounded, so disarmed, by reason of the infinite distance of the feeble creature from his Creator. The attributes (<a href="/job/9-4.htm">Job 9:4</a>) belong not to man (Olshausen), but to God, as <a href="/job/36-5.htm">Job 36:5</a>. God is wise of heart (&#1500;&#1489;  equals  &#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c2;) in putting one question after another, and mighty in strength in bringing to nought every attempt man may make to maintain his own right; to defy Him (&#1492;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;, to harden, i.e., &#1506;&#1512;&#1507;, the neck), therefore, always tends to the discomfiture of him who dares to bid Him defiance. </body></html>
