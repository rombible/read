How vain the enjoyments of time, which we may quite lose while yet time continues! The remembrance of having done our duty will be pleasing afterwards; so will not the remembrance of having got worldly wealth, when it is all lost and gone. Job's complaint of God, as one that could not be appeased and would not relent, was the language of his corruption. There is a Mediator, a Daysman, or Umpire, for us, even God's own beloved Son, who has purchased peace for us with the blood of his cross, who is able to save to the uttermost all who come unto God through him. If we trust in his name, our sins will be buried in the depths of the sea, we shall be washed from all our filthiness, and made whiter than snow, so that none can lay any thing to our charge. We shall be clothed with the robes of righteousness and salvation, adorned with the graces of the Holy Spirit, and presented faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy. May we learn the difference between justifying ourselves, and being thus justified by God himself. Let the tempest-tossed soul consider Job, and notice that others have passed this dreadful gulf; and though they found it hard to believe that God would hear or deliver them, yet he rebuked the storm, and brought them to the desired haven. Resist the devil; give not place to hard thoughts of God, or desperate conclusions about thyself. Come to Him who invites the weary and heavy laden; who promises in nowise to cast them out.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>If I say, I will forget my complaint - If I resolve that I will leave off complaining, and will be more cheerful, I find it all in vain.

We have the same expression still when we say to one who is sad and melancholy, "brighten up; be cheerful." The meaning is, that Job endeavored to appear pleasant and cheerful, but it was in vain. His sorrows pressed heavily on him, and weighed down his spirits in spite of himself, and made him sad. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>26. swift ships&#8212;rather, canoes of reeds or papyrus skiffs, used on the Nile, swift from their lightness (Isa 18:2).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/job/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">If I say; </span> if I resolve within myself. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I will forget my complaints; </span> I will cease complaining. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">My heaviness, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">mine anger</span>; wherewith Job was charged by his friends, <span class="bld"><a href="/job/18-4.htm" title="He tears himself in his anger: shall the earth be forsaken for you? and shall the rock be removed out of his place?">Job 18:4</a></span>; my angry expressions.

Job represents himself as sometimes, for a moment, imagining that he might put aside his load of sorrow by not thinking of it. He tries, and says to himself, "I will forget," etc.; but in vain. The whole mass of his sufferings seems to rise up against him, and make even momentary forgetfulness impossible. <span class="cmt_word">I</span> <span class="cmt_word">will leave off my heaviness</span>; or, <span class="accented">my black looks. <span class="cmt_word"></span>And comfort myself</span> (comp. <a href="/job/10-20.htm">Job 10:20</a> and <a href="/psalms/39-13.htm">Psalm 39:13</a>, where the same verb is rendered "recover strength"). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>21  Whether I am innocent, I know not myself,<p>My life is offensive to me.<p>22  There is one thing-therefore I maintain - :<p>The innocent and wicked He destroyeth.<p>23  If the scourge slay suddenly,<p>He laugheth at the melting away of the innocent.<p>24  Countries are given into the hand of the wicked;<p>The countenance of its rulers He veileth - <p>Is it not so, who else doeth it?<p><a href="/job/9-21.htm">Job 9:21</a> is usually considered to be an affirmation of innocence on the part of Job, though without effect, and even at the peril of his own destruction: "I am innocent, I boldly say it even with scorn of my life" (Schnurr., Hirz., Ewald, Schlottm.). But although &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; &#1488;&#1491;&#1506; &#1500;&#1488; may mean: I care nothing for my soul, i.e., my life (comp. <a href="/genesis/39-6.htm">Genesis 39:6</a>), its first meaning would be: I know not my soul, i.e., myself; and this sense is also quite in accordance with the context. He is innocent, but the contradiction between his lot and his innocence seems to show that his self-consciousness is deceptive, and makes him a mystery to himself, leads him astray respecting himself; and having thus become a stranger to himself, he abhors this life of seeming contradictions, for which he desires nothing less than its long continuance (vid., <a href="/job/7-16.htm">Job 7:16</a>). The &#1492;&#1497;&#1488; &#1488;&#1495;&#1514; which follows we do not explain: "it is all the same to me whether I live or not," but: it is all one whether man is innocent or not. He himself is a proof of this; therefore he maintains, etc. It is, however, also possible that this expression, which is similar in meaning to <a href="/ecclesiastes/9-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:2</a> (there is one event, &#1488;&#1495;&#1491; &#1502;&#1511;&#1512;&#1492;, to the righteous and to the wicked), and is well translated in the Targ. by &#1492;&#1497;&#1488; &#1502;&#1499;&#1497;&#1500;&#1488; &#1495;&#1491;&#1488; (there is one measure of retribution, &#1502;&#1499;&#1497;&#1500;&#1488;  equals  &#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1492;, &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, <a href="/matthew/7-2.htm">Matthew 7:2</a>), refers to what follows, and that "therefore I maintain" is parenthetical (like &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;&#1497;, <a href="/psalms/119-57.htm">Psalm 119:57</a>; &#1488;&#1502;&#1512; &#1500;&#1497;, <a href="/isaiah/45-24.htm">Isaiah 45:24</a>), and we have translated it accordingly. There is certainly a kind of suspense, and &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1499;&#1503; d introduces an assertion of Job, which is founded upon the fact of the continuance of his own misfortune, - an assertion which he advances in direct contradiction to the friends, and which is expressly censured by Elihu.<p>In <a href="/job/9-23.htm">Job 9:23</a>., by some striking examples, he completes the description of that which seems to be supported by the conflict he is called to endure. &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1496;, a scourge, signifies a judgment which passes over a nation (<a href="/isaiah/28-15.htm">Isaiah 28:15</a>). It swept off the guiltless as well, and therefore Job concludes that God delights in &#1502;&#1505;&#1468;&#1492;, &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;, trial, or perhaps more correctly the melting away (from &#1502;&#1505;&#1505;, as <a href="/job/6-14.htm">Job 6:14</a>) of the guiltless, i.e., their dissolution in anguish and dismay, their wearing away and despondency. Jerome rightly remarks that in the whole book Job says nihil asperius than what he says in <a href="/job/9-23.htm">Job 9:23</a>. Another example in favour of his disconsolate &#1492;&#1497;&#1488; &#1488;&#1495;&#1514; is that whole lands are given into the hand of the wicked: the monarch is an evil man, and the countenance of their judges He (God) covers, so that they do not distinguish between right and wrong, nor decide in favour of the former rather than of the latter. God himself is the final cause of the whole: if not, i.e., if it is not so, who can it then be that causes it? &#1488;&#1508;&#1493; (four times in the book of Job instead of the usual form &#1488;&#1508;&#1493;&#1488;) is, according to the current opinion, placed per hyperbaton in the conditional instead of the interrogative clause; and &#1502;&#1497; &#1488;&#1508;&#1493; are certainly not, with Hirzel, to be taken together. There is, however, not a proper hyperbaton, but &#1488;&#1508;&#1493; here gives intensity to the question; though not directly as <a href="/job/17-15.htm">Job 17:15</a> (Ges. 153, 2), but only indirectly, by giving intensity to that which introduces the question, as <a href="/job/24-25.htm">Job 24:25</a> and <a href="/genesis/27-37.htm">Genesis 27:37</a>; translate therefore: if it really is not so (comp. the Homeric expression &#x3b5;&#x3b9; &#787; &#x3b4; &#787; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;). It is indisputable that God, and no one else, is the final cause of this misery, apparently so full of contradiction, which meets us in the history of mankind, and which Job now experiences for himself. </body></html>
