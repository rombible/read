Houbigant’s version of this and the two preceding verses shows their connection admirably well, and, according to Bishop Lowth, gives us the true sense of the passage. “But, if I should call that he might answer me, I could not easily believe that he would hear my voice; since he hath broken me with a tempest, and inflicted many wounds upon me without cause; nor hath given me space to take my breath, so hath he filled me with bitterness.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/job/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:14-21 Job is still righteous in his own eyes, ch. 32:1, and this answer, though it sets forth the power and majesty of God, implies that the question between the afflicted and the Lord of providence, is a question of might, and not of right; and we begin to discover the evil fruits of pride and of a self-righteous spirit. Job begins to manifest a disposition to condemn God, that he may justify himself, for which he is afterwards reproved. Still Job knew so much of himself, that he durst not stand a trial. If we say, We have no sin, we not only deceive ourselves, but we affront God; for we sin in saying so, and give the lie to the Scripture. But Job reflected on God's goodness and justice in saying his affliction was without cause.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He will not suffer me to take my breath; - see the notes at <a href="/job/7-19.htm">Job 7:19</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16, 17. would I not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice&#8212;who breaketh me (as a tree stripped of its leaves) with a tempest.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/job/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> My pains and miseries are continual, and I have not so much as a breathing time free from them.

Which some think refers to Job's disease, which was either an asthma, or a quinsy in his throat, which occasioned great difficulty in breathing: I should rather think the allusion is to the hot burning winds in those countries before mentioned, which sometimes blew so strongly as almost to take away a man's breath; so the above traveller (u) reports, that between Suez and Cairo (in Egypt) they had for a day's time and more so hot a wind, that they were forced to turn their backs to it, to take a little breath. The design of Job is to show, that his afflictions were continued, and were without any intervals; they were repeated so fast, and came so thick upon him, one after another, that he had no breathing time; the import of the phrase is the same with that in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/7-19.htm">Job 7:19</a>, <p>but filleth me with bitterness; to the full, to satiety, to loathing, as a man may be with a bitter potion, with wormwood drink, and water of gall, with bitter afflictions comparable to such, whereby Job's life was embittered to him, see <a href="/jeremiah/9-15.htm">Jeremiah 9:15</a>. <p>(u) Travels. par. 1.

He does not turn or restrain His anger without having accomplished His purpose. This is a proposition which, thus broadly expressed, is only partially true, as is evident from <a href="/psalms/78-38.htm">Psalm 78:38</a>. The helpers of Rahab must bow themselves under Him. It is not feasible to understand this in a general sense, as meaning those who are ready with boastful arrogance to yield succour to any against God. The form of expression which follows in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/9-14.htm">Job 9:14</a>, "much less I," supports the assumption that &#1512;&#1492;&#1489; &#1506;&#1494;&#1512;&#1497; refers to some well-known extraordinary example of wicked enterprise which had been frustrated, notwithstanding the gigantic strength by which it was supported; and &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; may be translated by the present tense, since a familiar fact is used as synonymous with the expression of an universal truth. Elsewhere Rahab as a proper name denotes Egypt (<a href="/psalms/87-4.htm">Psalm 87:4</a>), but it cannot be so understood here, because direct references to events in the history of Israel are contrary to the character of the book, which, with remarkable consistency, avoids everything that is at all Israelitish. But how has Egypt obtained the name of Rahab? It is evident from <a href="/isaiah/30-7.htm">Isaiah 30:7</a> that it bears this name with reference to its deeds of prowess; but from <a href="/psalms/89-11.htm">Psalm 89:11</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/51-9.htm">Isaiah 51:9</a>, it is evident that Rahab properly denotes a sea-monster, which has become the symbol of Egypt, like tannn and leviathan elsewhere. This signification of the word is also supported by <a href="//biblehub.com/job/26-12.htm">Job 26:12</a>, where the lxx actually translate &#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, as here with remarkable freedom, &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0; &#787; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0; &#787; &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;. It is not clear whether these "sea-monsters" denote rebels cast down into the sea beneath the sky, or chained upon the sky; but at any rate the consciousness of a distinct mythological meaning in &#1512;&#1492;&#1489; &#1506;&#1494;&#1512;&#1497; is expressed by this translation (as also in the still freer translation of Jerome, et sub quo curvantur qui portant orbem); probably a myth connected with such names of the constellations as &#x39a;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; and &#x3a0;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; (Ewald, Hirz., Schlottm.). The poesy of the book of Job even in other places does not spurn mythological allusions; and the phrase before us reminds one of the Hindu myth of Indras' victory over the dark demon Vritras, who tries to delay the descent of rain, and over his helpers. In Vritras, as in &#1512;&#1492;&#1489;, there is the idea of hostile resistance.<p>Job compares himself, the feeble one, to these mythical titanic powers in <a href="/job/9-14.htm">Job 9:14</a>. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1488;&#1507; (properly: even that), or even &#1488;&#1507; alone (<a href="/job/4-19.htm">Job 4:19</a>), signifies, according as the connection introduces a climax or anti-climax, either quanto magis or quanto minus, as here: how much less can I, the feeble one, dispute with Him! &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/9-15.htm">Job 9:15</a>, is best taken, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/5-5.htm">Job 5:5</a>, in the signification quoniam. The part. Poel &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1496;&#1497; we should more correctly translate "my disputant" than "my judge;" it is Poel which Ewald appropriately styles the conjugation of attack: &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1508;&#1496;, judicando vel litigando aliquem petere; comp. Ges. 55, 1. The part. Kal denotes a judge, the part. Poel one who is accuser and judge at the same time. On such Poel-forms from strong roots, vid., on <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/109-10.htm">Psalm 109:10</a>, where wedorschu is to be read, and therefore it is written &#1493;&#1491;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468; in correct Codices. </body></html>
