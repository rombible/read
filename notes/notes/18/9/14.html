Job begins to manifest a disposition to condemn God, that he may justify himself, for which he is afterwards reproved. Still Job knew so much of himself, that he durst not stand a trial. If we say, We have no sin, we not only deceive ourselves, but we affront God; for we sin in saying so, and give the lie to the Scripture. But Job reflected on God's goodness and justice in saying his affliction was without cause.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>How much less shall I answer him? - I, who am so feeble, how can I contend with him? If the most mighty objects in the universe are under his control; if the constellations are directed by him; if the earth is shaken, and mountains moved from their places, by his power, and if the men of most exalted rank are prostrated by him, how can I presume to contend with God? This is the common view which is given of the passage, and is evidently that which our translators entertained. But I have given in the translation what appears to me to be a more literal version, and to express a better sense - though, I confess, the translation differs from all that I have seen. According to this, the sense is simply, that such was the veneration which Job had for the character of God, that should he attempt to answer him, he would select his words with the utmost care and attention. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14.

But parallel passages, such as <a href="/isaiah/40-22.htm">Isaiah 40:22</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/104-2.htm">Psalm 104:2</a>, and especially <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/44-24.htm">Isaiah 44:24</a>, show that <a href="/job/9-8.htm">Job 9:8</a> is to be understood as referring to the creation of the firmament of heaven; and consequently &#1504;&#1496;&#1492; is to be taken in the sense of expandere, and is a form of expression naturally occurring in connection with the mention of the waters which are separated by means of the &#1512;&#1511;&#1497;&#1506;. The question arises, whether &#1497;&#1501; here means the sea of waters above the firmament or upon the earth. According to the idea of the ancients, the waters which descend as rain have their habitation far away in the infinite expanse of the sky; the ocean of the sky (Egyptian Nun-pa), through which the sun-god Ra sails every day, is there. It is possible that "the heights of the sea" here, and perhaps also "the roots of the sea" (<a href="/job/36-30.htm">Job 36:30</a>), may mean this ocean of the sky, as Hahn and Schlottmann suppose. But it is not necessary to adopt such an explanation, and it is moreover hazardous, since this conception of the celestial &#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b1; is not found elsewhere (apart from <a href="/revelation/4-6.htm">Revelation 4:6</a>; <a href="/revelation/15-2.htm">Revelation 15:2</a>; <a href="/revelation/22-1.htm">Revelation 22:1</a>). Why may not &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1514;&#1497;, which is used of the heights of the clouds (<a href="/isaiah/14-14.htm">Isaiah 14:14</a>), be used also of the waves of the sea which mount up towards heaven (<a href="/psalms/107-26.htm">Psalm 107:26</a>)? God walks over them as man walks on level ground (lxx &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; &#x3c9;&#788;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0; &#787; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;); they rise or lie calmly beneath His feel according to His almighty will (comp. <a href="/habakkuk/3-15.htm">Habakkuk 3:15</a>).<p>Job next describes God as the Creator of the stars, by introducing a constellation of the northern (the Bear), one of the southern (Orion), and one of the eastern sky (the Pleiades). &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;, contracted from &#1504;&#1506;&#1513;&#1473;, Arabic na&#8219;s&#780;, a bier, is the constellation of seven stars (septentrio or septentriones) in the northern sky. The Greater and the Lesser Bear form a square, which the Arabs regarded as a bier; the three other stars, bena&#770;th n&#8219;asch, i.e., daughters of the bier (comp. <a href="/job/38-32.htm">Job 38:32</a>), seem to be the mourners. &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1497;&#1500; is Orion chained to the sky, which the ancients regarded as a powerful giant, and also as an insolent, foolish fellow <p>(Note: The Arabic ja&#770;hil is similar, which combines the significations, an ignorant, foolhardy, and passionate man (vid., Fleischer, Ali's hundert Sprche, S. 115f.).)<p>(K. O. Mller, Kleine deutsche Schriften, ii. 125). &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1502;&#1492; is the Pleiades, a constellation consisting of seven large and other smaller stars, Arabic turayya&#770;, which, like the Hebrew (comp. Arab. ku&#770;mat, cumulus), signifies the heap, cluster (vid., <a href="/job/38-31.htm">Job 38:31</a>), and is compared by the Persian poets to a bouquet formed of jewels. It is the constellation of seven stars, whose rising and setting determined the commencement and end of their voyages (&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c2;, probably  equals  constellation of navigation), and is to be distinguished from the northern septentriones. &#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1502;&#1503; &#1495;&#1491;&#1512;&#1497; are, according to the Targ., the chambers of the constellations on the south side of the heavens, as also most expositors explain them (Mercier: sidera quae sunt in altero hemisphaerio versus alterum polum antarcticum), according to which &#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1502;&#1503;, or written defectively &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1503;, would therefore be equivalent to &#1514;&#1502;&#1503; &#1499;&#1493;&#1499;&#1489;&#1497;; or perhaps, in a more general meaning, the regions of the southern sky (penetralia), which are veiled, or altogether lost to view (Hirzel). In v. 10, Job says, almost verbatim, what Eliphaz had said (<a href="/job/5-10.htm">Job 5:10</a>). Job agrees with the friends in the recognition of the power of God, and intentionally describes those phases of it which display its terrible majesty. But while the friends deduce from this doctrine the duty of a humble deportment on the part of the sufferer, Job uses it to support the cheerless truth that human right can never be maintained in opposition to the absolute God. </body></html>
