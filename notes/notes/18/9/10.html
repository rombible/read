Before him he pleaded guilty of sins more than could be counted; and if God should contend with him in judgment, he could not justify one out of a thousand, of all the thoughts, words, and actions of his life; therefore he deserved worse than all his present sufferings. When Job mentions the wisdom and power of God, he forgets his complaints. We are unfit to judge of God's proceedings, because we know not what he does, or what he designs. God acts with power which no creature can resist. Those who think they have strength enough to help others, will not be able to help themselves against it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Which doeth great things - This is almost the sentiment which had been expressed by Eliphaz; see the notes, <a href="/job/5-9.htm">Job 5:9</a>.

In heaven and earth; great as to quantity and quality, not to be thoroughly searched out so as to tell their numbers, nor explain and express the nature of them to the full; even what he has done, and does in creation, providence, and grace: <p>yea, and wonders without number; such as are amazing to men, who cannot account for them, and so many that they cannot number them. The same things are said by Eliphaz; see Gill on <a href="/job/5-9.htm">Job 5:9</a>; and which Job here repeats, to show that he agreed with him, and was ready to own what was truth, whenever expressed by him or his friends, and especially such as made for the glory of the Divine Being. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Which doeth great things past finding out; yea, and wonders without number.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/job/9.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">10</span>. The description of the operation of God’s might in the material world concludes with a general statement that this operation surpasses all power of comprehension by the human mind. The words are exactly those of Eliphaz ch. <a href="/job/5-9.htm" title="Which does great things and unsearchable; marvelous things without number:">Job 5:9</a>, but while to Eliphaz all God’s operations have an ethical meaning and subserve one great purpose of goodness, to Job they seem the mere un-moral play of an immeasurable Force. This force was of course a Person, for an impersonal force is an idea unknown to the Shemitic mind. But this force seemed all the more tremendous to Job from his having no idea of second causes or of what we call laws of nature; the phenomena of the universe, even the most stupendous, were the immediate work of this mighty agent.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> <span class="cmt_word">Which doeth great things past finding out; yea, and wonders without number</span>. An almost exact repetition of the words of Eliphaz in <a href="/job/5-9.htm">Job 5:9</a>. The repetition may have been conscious or unconscious. Job may have meant to say, "My view of God embraces all that you can tell me of him, and goes further;" or he may simply have used words concerning the Divine unsearch-ableness which were common in the mouths of religious men in his time (comp. <a href="/psalms/72-18.htm">Psalm 72:18</a>; and infra, <a href="/job/11-7.htm">Job 11:7</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>  1  Then Job began, and said:<p>  2  Yea, indeed, I know it is thus,<p>And how should a man be just with God!<p>  3  Should he wish to contend with God,<p>He could not answer Him one of a thousand.<p>  4  The wise in heart and mighty in strength,<p>Who hath defied Him and remained unhurt?<p>Job does not (<a href="/job/9-1.htm">Job 9:1</a>) refer to what Eliphaz said (<a href="/job/4-17.htm">Job 4:17</a>), which is similar, though still not exactly the same; but "indeed I know it is so" must be supposed to be an assert to that which Bildad had said immediately before. The chief thought of Bildad's speech was, that God does not pervert what is right. Certainly (&#1488;&#1502;&#1504;&#1501;, scilicet, nimirum, like <a href="/job/12-2.htm">Job 12:2</a>), - says Job, as he ironically confirms this maxim of Bildad's, - it is so: what God does is always right, because God does it; how could man maintain that he is in the right in opposition to God! If God should be willing to enter into controversy with man, he would not be able to give Him information on one of a thousand subjects that might be brought into discussion; he would be so confounded, so disarmed, by reason of the infinite distance of the feeble creature from his Creator. The attributes (<a href="/job/9-4.htm">Job 9:4</a>) belong not to man (Olshausen), but to God, as <a href="/job/36-5.htm">Job 36:5</a>. God is wise of heart (&#1500;&#1489;  equals  &#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c2;) in putting one question after another, and mighty in strength in bringing to nought every attempt man may make to maintain his own right; to defy Him (&#1492;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;, to harden, i.e., &#1506;&#1512;&#1507;, the neck), therefore, always tends to the discomfiture of him who dares to bid Him defiance. </body></html>
