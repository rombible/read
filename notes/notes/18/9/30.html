As Job’s <span class="ital">washing </span>himself is to be understood only of his clearing himself judicially, and showing that he was innocent of the things laid to his charge, so God’s <span class="ital">plunging </span>him, &c., is not to be understood of his making him sinful and guilty, but of his proving him to be so, notwithstanding all the professions and evidences of his purity before men. <span class="ital">And mine own clothes shall abhor me — </span>I shall be so filthy, that my own clothes, if they had any sense in them, would abhor to touch me. Job saw that his afflictions, coming from the hand of God, were the things that blackened him in the eyes of his friends, and caused them to think him a wicked man; and therefore, on that account, as well as because of the pain and torment they gave him, he complained of them, and of the continuance of them. Observe, reader, if we be ever so industrious to justify ourselves before men, and to preserve our credit with them; if we keep our hands ever so clean from the pollutions of gross sin; yet God, who knows our hearts, can charge us with so much secret iniquity, and internal depravity, as must for ever cut us off from all hopes of ever being able to justify ourselves before him. Paul, while a Pharisee, had made his hands, as he thought, very clean, but when the commandment came, and discovered to him that his inward parts were very wickedness, he found himself plunged in the ditch.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/job/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:25-35 What little need have we of pastimes, and what great need to redeem time, when it runs on so fast towards eternity! How vain the enjoyments of time, which we may quite lose while yet time continues! The remembrance of having done our duty will be pleasing afterwards; so will not the remembrance of having got worldly wealth, when it is all lost and gone. Job's complaint of God, as one that could not be appeased and would not relent, was the language of his corruption. There is a Mediator, a Daysman, or Umpire, for us, even God's own beloved Son, who has purchased peace for us with the blood of his cross, who is able to save to the uttermost all who come unto God through him. If we trust in his name, our sins will be buried in the depths of the sea, we shall be washed from all our filthiness, and made whiter than snow, so that none can lay any thing to our charge. We shall be clothed with the robes of righteousness and salvation, adorned with the graces of the Holy Spirit, and presented faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy. May we learn the difference between justifying ourselves, and being thus justified by God himself. Let the tempest-tossed soul consider Job, and notice that others have passed this dreadful gulf; and though they found it hard to believe that God would hear or deliver them, yet he rebuked the storm, and brought them to the desired haven. Resist the devil; give not place to hard thoughts of God, or desperate conclusions about thyself. Come to Him who invites the weary and heavy laden; who promises in nowise to cast them out.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>If I wash myself with snow water - If I should make myself as pure as possible, and should become, in my view, perfectly holy. Snow water, it seems, was regarded as especially pure. The whiteness of snow itself perhaps suggested the idea that the water of melted snow was better than other for purification. Washing the hands formerly was an emblem of cleansing from guilt. Hence Pilate, when he gave up the Savior to death, took water and washed his hands before the multitude, and said that he was innocent of his blood; <a href="/matthew/27-24.htm">Matthew 27:24</a>. The expression used here by Job, also is imitated by the Psalmist, to denote his innocence:<p>I will wash mine hands in innocency:<p>So will I compass thine altar, O Lord. <a href="/psalms/26-6.htm">Psalm 26:6</a>.<p>Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain,<p>And washed my hands in innocency.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>30. snow water&#8212;thought to be more cleansing than common water, owing to the whiteness of snow (Ps 51:7; Isa 1:18).<p>never so clean&#8212;Better, to answer to the parallelism of the first clause which expresses the cleansing material, "lye:" the Arabs used alkali mixed with oil, as soap (Ps 73:13; Jer 2:22).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/job/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">If I wash myself; </span> either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

If I should succeed in purging myself of all guilt, and establishing, so far as words can do it, my spotless innocence even then what advantage should I gain? Snow-water does not really cleanse what is defiled better than any other water, but a lively fancy might suppose it to do so. Job indulges in this fancy, but then checks himself, and adds a prosaic alternative. And make my hands never so clean; rather, and <span class="accented">make my hands clean with lye.</span> Lye, or potash, is the principal and most essential ingredient in soap. and the readiest and best detergent.

But although &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; &#1488;&#1491;&#1506; &#1500;&#1488; may mean: I care nothing for my soul, i.e., my life (comp. <a href="/genesis/39-6.htm">Genesis 39:6</a>), its first meaning would be: I know not my soul, i.e., myself; and this sense is also quite in accordance with the context. He is innocent, but the contradiction between his lot and his innocence seems to show that his self-consciousness is deceptive, and makes him a mystery to himself, leads him astray respecting himself; and having thus become a stranger to himself, he abhors this life of seeming contradictions, for which he desires nothing less than its long continuance (vid., <a href="/job/7-16.htm">Job 7:16</a>). The &#1492;&#1497;&#1488; &#1488;&#1495;&#1514; which follows we do not explain: "it is all the same to me whether I live or not," but: it is all one whether man is innocent or not. He himself is a proof of this; therefore he maintains, etc. It is, however, also possible that this expression, which is similar in meaning to <a href="/ecclesiastes/9-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:2</a> (there is one event, &#1488;&#1495;&#1491; &#1502;&#1511;&#1512;&#1492;, to the righteous and to the wicked), and is well translated in the Targ. by &#1492;&#1497;&#1488; &#1502;&#1499;&#1497;&#1500;&#1488; &#1495;&#1491;&#1488; (there is one measure of retribution, &#1502;&#1499;&#1497;&#1500;&#1488;  equals  &#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1492;, &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, <a href="/matthew/7-2.htm">Matthew 7:2</a>), refers to what follows, and that "therefore I maintain" is parenthetical (like &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;&#1497;, <a href="/psalms/119-57.htm">Psalm 119:57</a>; &#1488;&#1502;&#1512; &#1500;&#1497;, <a href="/isaiah/45-24.htm">Isaiah 45:24</a>), and we have translated it accordingly. There is certainly a kind of suspense, and &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1499;&#1503; d introduces an assertion of Job, which is founded upon the fact of the continuance of his own misfortune, - an assertion which he advances in direct contradiction to the friends, and which is expressly censured by Elihu.<p>In <a href="/job/9-23.htm">Job 9:23</a>., by some striking examples, he completes the description of that which seems to be supported by the conflict he is called to endure. &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1496;, a scourge, signifies a judgment which passes over a nation (<a href="/isaiah/28-15.htm">Isaiah 28:15</a>). It swept off the guiltless as well, and therefore Job concludes that God delights in &#1502;&#1505;&#1468;&#1492;, &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;, trial, or perhaps more correctly the melting away (from &#1502;&#1505;&#1505;, as <a href="/job/6-14.htm">Job 6:14</a>) of the guiltless, i.e., their dissolution in anguish and dismay, their wearing away and despondency. Jerome rightly remarks that in the whole book Job says nihil asperius than what he says in <a href="/job/9-23.htm">Job 9:23</a>. Another example in favour of his disconsolate &#1492;&#1497;&#1488; &#1488;&#1495;&#1514; is that whole lands are given into the hand of the wicked: the monarch is an evil man, and the countenance of their judges He (God) covers, so that they do not distinguish between right and wrong, nor decide in favour of the former rather than of the latter. God himself is the final cause of the whole: if not, i.e., if it is not so, who can it then be that causes it? &#1488;&#1508;&#1493; (four times in the book of Job instead of the usual form &#1488;&#1508;&#1493;&#1488;) is, according to the current opinion, placed per hyperbaton in the conditional instead of the interrogative clause; and &#1502;&#1497; &#1488;&#1508;&#1493; are certainly not, with Hirzel, to be taken together. There is, however, not a proper hyperbaton, but &#1488;&#1508;&#1493; here gives intensity to the question; though not directly as <a href="/job/17-15.htm">Job 17:15</a> (Ges. 153, 2), but only indirectly, by giving intensity to that which introduces the question, as <a href="/job/24-25.htm">Job 24:25</a> and <a href="/genesis/27-37.htm">Genesis 27:37</a>; translate therefore: if it really is not so (comp. the Homeric expression &#x3b5;&#x3b9; &#787; &#x3b4; &#787; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;). It is indisputable that God, and no one else, is the final cause of this misery, apparently so full of contradiction, which meets us in the history of mankind, and which Job now experiences for himself. </body></html>
