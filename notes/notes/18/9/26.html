Literally, <span class= "ital">ships of Eveh, </span>probably a proper name, and perhaps referring to a particular kind of boat in use on the Nile; if so, this is one instance out of many of Job’s acquaintance with Egypt. The Vulgate has, <span class= "ital">naves poma portantes. </span>Job is a problem to himself; he is confident of his innocence, and yet he is confident that that very innocence will avail him nothing before God, he is sure that he must be condemned. Now, it is impossible to deny that this is the very attitude of the Gospel; it is, therefore, if we bear in mind the vast antiquity of the confession, both a witness to the truth of the Gospel and an anticipation of it that God alone could give. Indeed, it is hopelessly impossible to enter into the position of Job unless we are ourselves enlightened with the teaching of the Gospel, and able to look at it from the Gospel standpoint. While, therefore, admitting this fact, we are the better able to appreciate the wonderful confession Job is about to make in <a href="/context/job/9-32.htm" title="For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, and we should come together in judgment.">Job 9:32-33</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/job/9.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/job/9-26.htm" title="They are passed away as the swift ships: as the eagle that hastens to the prey.">Job 9:26</a></span>. <span class="ital">As the swift ships — </span>Hebrew, ships of desire; that is, such as are longed for, and long to be at their destined port, and crowd all the sail they can for that purpose.

What great need to redeem time, which runs out, runs on so fast toward eternity! And how vain are the enjoyments of time, which we may be deprived of, even while time continues.

How vain the enjoyments of time, which we may quite lose while yet time continues! The remembrance of having done our duty will be pleasing afterwards; so will not the remembrance of having got worldly wealth, when it is all lost and gone. Job's complaint of God, as one that could not be appeased and would not relent, was the language of his corruption. There is a Mediator, a Daysman, or Umpire, for us, even God's own beloved Son, who has purchased peace for us with the blood of his cross, who is able to save to the uttermost all who come unto God through him. If we trust in his name, our sins will be buried in the depths of the sea, we shall be washed from all our filthiness, and made whiter than snow, so that none can lay any thing to our charge. We shall be clothed with the robes of righteousness and salvation, adorned with the graces of the Holy Spirit, and presented faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy. May we learn the difference between justifying ourselves, and being thus justified by God himself. Let the tempest-tossed soul consider Job, and notice that others have passed this dreadful gulf; and though they found it hard to believe that God would hear or deliver them, yet he rebuked the storm, and brought them to the desired haven. Resist the devil; give not place to hard thoughts of God, or desperate conclusions about thyself. Come to Him who invites the weary and heavy laden; who promises in nowise to cast them out.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They are passed away as the swift ships - Margin, Ships of desire; or ships of Ebeh. Hebrew &#1488;&#1489;&#1492; &#1488;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492;  'on&#305;&#770;ya&#770;h 'e&#770;beh. Vulgate, Naves poma portantes. Septuagint, "Is there any track left by ships in their passage?" The Chaldee renders it as the Vulgate, "Ships bearing good fruit;" that is, as such fruit was perishable, haste was required in order to reach the place of destination. Our translators were evidently perplexed by the word &#1488;&#1489;&#1492;  'e&#770;beh, as appears by their placing two different phrases in the margin. "Ships of desire," denotes the value or desirableness of such ships; and the phrase, "Ships of Ebeh," denotes their confession of ignorance as to the meaning of the word. Gesenius explains the word to mean reed, bulrush, or papyrus - from an Arabic use of the word, and supposes that the reference is to the light vessels made of the papyrus, which were used on the Nile; see the note at <a href="/isaiah/18-2.htm">Isaiah 18:2</a>. Such vessels would be distinguished for the ease with which they might be rowed, and the rapidity of their motion. Chardin supposes that the reference is to vessels that were made to go on the Euphrates or the Tigris, and that were borne along with the rapid current. The supposition of an allusion to any boat or vessel under full sail, will be in accordance with the language here, though the probability is, that the reference is to the light vessels, made of reeds, that might be propelled with so much fleetness. Sails were frequently used, also, for such vessels.<p>As the eagle that hasteth to the prey - A striking emblem of rapidity.

Those that are lightest built, and run swiftest. Bar Tzemach thinks such vessels as are rowed with oars are meant, which may be called "ships of will or desire" (b), as the words may be rendered, because they may be rowed at pleasure, and be carried to any place where and when a man thinks fit; whereas those that are not depend upon the wind, and that must be waited for; or they design such ships that are so swift in their motion, that they arrive to the haven as soon as men can well wish for and desire. Some render it "pirate ships", or "ships of enmity" (c); such as are designed for spoil and plunder, and which are light ones, not loaded with goods, and therefore move swiftly: the Targum is, <p>"ships burdened with precious fruits;''and the Vulgate Latin version is,"ships carrying apples:''now ships loaded with such sort of goods, with perishing commodities, are obliged to make their port as soon as possible. Some leave the word untranslated, and call them "ships of Ebeh" (d); which, according to Jarchi, Aben Ezra, and others, is either the name of a place, or of a river in Arabia, which ran with a rapid stream, and in which ships were carried with great celerity. Bolducius relates from a traveller of his acquaintance, who finished his travels in 1584, that he saw such a river about Damascus, not far from the sepulchre of Job; but that must be the river Chrysorrhoas, now called Barrady; but there were two rivers of this name Ebeh; one near Cufa, and another in Wasith, a country of Babylon, as Golius observes (e). Others take the word to have the signification of reed or papyrus, which grew on the banks of the Nile, and of which ships were made; see Gill on <a href="/isaiah/18-1.htm">Isaiah 18:1</a>; and render the words "ships of reeds" or "of papyrus" (f), and which, being light, were very swift: <p>as the eagle that hasteth to the prey; the eagle is the swiftest of birds, and therefore persons and things exceeding swift are compared unto them, see <a href="/habakkuk/1-8.htm">Habakkuk 1:8</a>; and it flies the most swiftly when being hungry, and in sight of its prey, and is nearest to it, and flaps upon it, which is the thing referred to, and so may be rendered, "that flies upon the prey" (g). Job uses these metaphors, which are the most appropriate, to show how fleeting his days of prosperity were, and how soon gone: and a climax may be observed in the words; a runner, though he runs swiftly, a ship moves faster than he, and an eagle, just about to seize its prey, flies swifter than that. <p>(b)  "navibus desiderii", Mercerus, Drusius, Schmidt; so Ben Gersom.

Plant.,' 4:9; Pithy, 'Hist. Nat.,' 6:56; 13:11; Luean, ' Pharsalis,' 4:36, etc.). They were long, light canoes, formed generally of the papyrus plant, and propelled either by a single paddle or by a punting-pole. They were fiat-bottomed and broad, like punts, with a stem and stern rising considerably above the level of the water (see the authofs 'History of Ancient Egypt,' vol. 1. pp. 507, 508). Isaiah speaks of them as "vessels of bulrushes," in which "swift messengers" were sent by the nations peopling the banks of the Nile (<a href="/isaiah/18-1.htm">Isaiah 18:1, 2</a>). The Euphrates boats described by Herodotus (1:194) were of an entirely different construction, and cannot be here intended. They consisted of a framework of wood, which was covered with skins, and then coated with bitumen, and resembled the Welsh "coracles<span class="cmt_word">." As the eagle that hasteth to the prey</span>; or, <span class="accented">as the eagle that swoopeth on the prey</span> (Revised Version). Job's observation presents to him three types of swiftness - the trained runner upon the earth, the swift ships upon the waters, and the hungry eagle in the air. It seems to him that his life passes away as swiftly as any of these. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>16  If when I called He really answered,<p>I could not believe that He would hearken to me;<p>17  He would rather crush me in a tempest,<p>And only multiply my wounds without cause;<p>18  He would not suffer me to take my breath,<p>But would fill me with bitter things.<p>19  If it is a question of the strength of the strong - : "Behold here!"<p>And if of right - : "Who will challenge me?"<p>20  Where I in the right, my mouth must condemn me;<p>Were I innocent, He would declare me guilty.<p>The answer of God when called upon, i.e., summoned, is represented in <a href="/job/9-16.htm">Job 9:16</a> as an actual result (praet. followed by fut. consec.), therefore <a href="/job/9-16.htm">Job 9:16</a> cannot be intended to express: I could not believe that He answers me, but: I could not believe that He, the answerer, would hearken to me; His infinite exaltation would not permit such condescension. The &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; which follows, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/9-17.htm">Job 9:17</a>, signifies either quippe qui or quoniam; both shades of meaning are after all blended, as in <a href="/job/9-15.htm">Job 9:15</a>. The question arises here whether &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1507; signifies conterere, or as cognate form with &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1507;, inhiare, - a question also of importance in the exposition of the Protevangelium. There are in all only three passages in which it occurs: here, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>, and <a href="/psalms/139-11.htm">Psalm 139:11</a>. In <a href="/psalms/139-11.htm">Psalm 139:11</a> the meaning conterere is unsuitable, but even the signification inhiare can only be adopted for want of a better: perhaps it may be explained by comparison with &#1510;&#1506;&#1507;, in the sense of obvelare, or as a denominative from &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1507; (the verb of which, &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1507;, is kindred to &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;, &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501;, flare) in the signification obtenebrare. In <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>, if regarded superficially, the meaning inhiare and conterere are alike suitable, but the meaning inhiare deprives that utterance of God of its prophetic character, which has been recognised from the beginning; and the meaning conterere, contundere, is strongly supported by the translations. We decide in favour of this meaning also in the present passage, with the ancient translations (lxx &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c8;&#x3b7;&#837;, Targ. &#1502;&#1491;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1511;, comminuens). Moreover, it is the meaning most generally supported by a comparison with the dialects, whereas the signification inhiare can only be sustained by comparison with &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1507; and the Arabic sa&#770;fa (to sniff, track by scent, to smell); besides, "to assail angrily" (Hirz., Ewald) is an inadmissible contortion of inhiare, which signifies in a hostile sense "to seize abruptly" (Schlottm.), properly to snatch, to desire to seize.<p>Translate therefore: He would crush me in a tempest and multiply (multiplicaret), etc., would not let me take breath (respirare), but (&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, Ges. 155, 1, e. a.) fill me (&#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1506;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;, with Pathach with Rebia mugrasch) with bitter things (&#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1512;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, with Dag. dirimens, which gives the word a more pathetic expression). The meaning of <a href="/job/9-19.htm">Job 9:19</a> is that God stifles the attempt to maintain one's right in the very beginning by His being superior to the creature in strength, and not entering into a dispute with him concerning the right. &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; (for &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; as &#1488;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/15-23.htm">Job 15:23</a>, for &#1488;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;): see, here I am, ready for the contest, is the word of God, similar to quis citare possit me (in <a href="/jeremiah/49-19.htm">Jeremiah 49:19</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/50-44.htm">Jeremiah 50:44</a>), which sounds as an echo of this passage. The creature must always be in the wrong, - a thought true in itself, in connection with which Job forgets that God's right in opposition to the creature is also always the true objective right. &#1508;&#1468;&#1497;, with suffix, accented to indicate its logical connection, as <a href="/job/15-6.htm">Job 15:6</a> : my own mouth.<p>(Note: Olshausen's conjecture, &#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493;, lessens the difficulty in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/34-16.htm">Isaiah 34:16</a>, but here it destroys the strong expression of the violence done to the moral consciousness.)<p>In &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497; the Chirek of the Hiphil is shortened to a Sheva, as <a href="/1_samuel/17-25.htm">1 Samuel 17:25</a>; vid., Ges. 53, rem. 4. The subject is God, not "my mouth" (Schlottm.): supposing that I were innocent, He would put me down as one morally wrong and to be rejected. </body></html>
