Job begins to manifest a disposition to condemn God, that he may justify himself, for which he is afterwards reproved. Still Job knew so much of himself, that he durst not stand a trial. If we say, We have no sin, we not only deceive ourselves, but we affront God; for we sin in saying so, and give the lie to the Scripture. But Job reflected on God's goodness and justice in saying his affliction was without cause.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For he breaketh me - He is overwhelming me with a tempest; that is, with the storms of wrath. He shows me no mercy. The idea seems to be, that God acted toward him not as a judge determining matters by rule of law, but as a sovereign - determining them by his own will. If it were a matter of law; if he could come before him as a judge, and maintain his cause there; if the case could be fairly adjudicated whether he deserved the calamities that came upon him, he would be willing to enter into such a trial. But where the matter was determined solely by will, and God acted as a sovereign, doing as he pleased, and giving no account of his matters to anyone, then it would be useless to argue the cause. He would not know what to expect, or understand the principles on which an adjudication would be made. It is true that God acts as a sovereign, but he does not act without reference to law. He dispenses his favors and his judgments as he pleases, but he violates none of the rules of right. The error of Job was the common error which people commit, that if God acts as a sovereign, he must of course act regardless of law, and that it is vain to plead with him or try to please him. But sovereignty is not necessarily inconsistent with respect for law; and He who presides with the most absolute power over the universe, is He who is most directed by the rule of right. In Him sovereignty and law coincide; and to come to Him as a sovereign, is to come with the assurance that supreme rectitude will be done.<p>And multiplieth my wounds without cause - That is, without sufficient reason. This is in accordance with the views which Job had repeatedly expressed. The main ground of his complaint was, that his sufferings were disproportionate to his faults. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16, 17. would I not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice&#8212;who breaketh me (as a tree stripped of its leaves) with a tempest.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/job/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This is the reason of his foregoing diffidence, that even when God seemed to answer him in words, yet the course of his actions towards him was of a quite contrary nature and tendency. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">With a tempest; </span> as with a tempest, i.e. unexpectedly, violently, and irrecoverably. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Without cause; </span> not simply without any desert of his, or as if he had no sin in him, for he oft declares the contrary; but without any evident or special cause of such singular afflictions, i.e. any peculiar and extraordinary guilt, such as my friends charge me with. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/job/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For he breaketh me with a tempest,.... Which rises suddenly, comes powerfully, and carries all before it irresistibly; hereby signifying the nature of his present sore afflictions, which came upon him at once, pressed him down, and utterly destroyed him, against which there was no standing: perhaps he may have some reference to the storm of wind that blew down the house, by which his children were destroyed. Schultens renders it, "a burning tempest" (s), such as is common in the eastern countries, which Thevenot (t) often makes mention of; which kills a man at once, and his flesh becomes as black as a coal, and comes off of his bones, and is plucked off by the hand that would lift him up; with which a man is broken to pieces indeed, to which Job may allude: <p>and multiplieth my wounds without cause; referring, it may be, to the many boils and ulcers upon his body; though it may also respect the multiplicity of ways in which he had wounded or afflicted him, in his person, in his family, and in his substance, and which he says was done "without cause"; not without a cause or reason in God, who does nothing without one, though it may not be known to men; particularly in afflicting men, it is not without cause or reason; it he punishes men, it is for sin; if he rebukes and chastises his people, it is for their transgressions; to bring them to a sense of them, to humble them for them, to bring them off from them, or to prevent them, or purge them away, and to try their graces, wean them from the world, and fit them for himself: but Job's afflictions were without any such cause intimated by his friends; it was not hypocrisy, nor any notorious sin or sins he had been guilty of, and secretly lived and indulged himself in, as they imagined. Job here suggests his innocence, which he always insisted upon, and refers his afflictions to the sovereign will of God, and to some hidden cause in his own breast, unknown to himself and others: however, so long as he dealt with him after this manner, he could not believe his prayers were heard by him. <p>(s) "in turbine ardenti", Schultens.

The word translated <span class="ital">break</span> may mean to seize and swallow up, that is, <span class="ital">to sweep away</span>, cf. ch. <a href="/job/30-22.htm" title="You lift me up to the wind; you cause me to ride on it, and dissolve my substance.">Job 30:22</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">17–21</span>. These verses describe what would ensue in the supposed case that God had actually responded to Job’s citation. He would not listen to Job’s plea but would crush him with His infinite power.

"<span class="accented">God</span>" that is, "would not be likely patiently to hear my justification, and calmly to weigh it, when he is already overwhelming me with his wrath, breaking and crushing me (comp. <a href="/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>, where the same word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e4;</span> is used) with a very storm of calamity." The sentiment can scarcely be justified, since it breathes something of a contamacious spirit. But this only shows that Job was not yet" made perfect through sufferings" (<a href="/hebrews/2-10.htm">Hebrews 2:10</a>). And multiplieth my wounds without cause. A further assertion, not of absolute sinlessness, but of comparative innocence - of the belief that he had done nothing to deserve such a terrible punishment as he is suffering (comp. <a href="/job/6-24.htm">Job 6:24, 29</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>11  Behold, He goeth by me and I see not,<p>And passeth by and I perceive Him not.<p>12  Behold, He taketh away, who will hold Him back?<p>Who will say to Him: What doest Thou?<p>13  Eloah restraineth not His anger,<p>The helpers of Rahab stoop under Him - <p>14  How much less that I should address Him,<p>That I should choose the right words in answer to Him;<p>15  Because, though I were right, I could not answer, - <p>To Him as my Judge I must make supplication.<p>God works among men, as He works in nature, with a supreme control over all, invisibly, irresistibly, and is not responsible to any being (<a href="/isaiah/45-9.htm">Isaiah 45:9</a>). He does not turn or restrain His anger without having accomplished His purpose. This is a proposition which, thus broadly expressed, is only partially true, as is evident from <a href="/psalms/78-38.htm">Psalm 78:38</a>. The helpers of Rahab must bow themselves under Him. It is not feasible to understand this in a general sense, as meaning those who are ready with boastful arrogance to yield succour to any against God. The form of expression which follows in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/9-14.htm">Job 9:14</a>, "much less I," supports the assumption that &#1512;&#1492;&#1489; &#1506;&#1494;&#1512;&#1497; refers to some well-known extraordinary example of wicked enterprise which had been frustrated, notwithstanding the gigantic strength by which it was supported; and &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; may be translated by the present tense, since a familiar fact is used as synonymous with the expression of an universal truth. Elsewhere Rahab as a proper name denotes Egypt (<a href="/psalms/87-4.htm">Psalm 87:4</a>), but it cannot be so understood here, because direct references to events in the history of Israel are contrary to the character of the book, which, with remarkable consistency, avoids everything that is at all Israelitish. But how has Egypt obtained the name of Rahab? It is evident from <a href="/isaiah/30-7.htm">Isaiah 30:7</a> that it bears this name with reference to its deeds of prowess; but from <a href="/psalms/89-11.htm">Psalm 89:11</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/51-9.htm">Isaiah 51:9</a>, it is evident that Rahab properly denotes a sea-monster, which has become the symbol of Egypt, like tannn and leviathan elsewhere. This signification of the word is also supported by <a href="//biblehub.com/job/26-12.htm">Job 26:12</a>, where the lxx actually translate &#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, as here with remarkable freedom, &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0; &#787; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0; &#787; &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;. It is not clear whether these "sea-monsters" denote rebels cast down into the sea beneath the sky, or chained upon the sky; but at any rate the consciousness of a distinct mythological meaning in &#1512;&#1492;&#1489; &#1506;&#1494;&#1512;&#1497; is expressed by this translation (as also in the still freer translation of Jerome, et sub quo curvantur qui portant orbem); probably a myth connected with such names of the constellations as &#x39a;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; and &#x3a0;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; (Ewald, Hirz., Schlottm.). The poesy of the book of Job even in other places does not spurn mythological allusions; and the phrase before us reminds one of the Hindu myth of Indras' victory over the dark demon Vritras, who tries to delay the descent of rain, and over his helpers. In Vritras, as in &#1512;&#1492;&#1489;, there is the idea of hostile resistance.<p>Job compares himself, the feeble one, to these mythical titanic powers in <a href="/job/9-14.htm">Job 9:14</a>. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1488;&#1507; (properly: even that), or even &#1488;&#1507; alone (<a href="/job/4-19.htm">Job 4:19</a>), signifies, according as the connection introduces a climax or anti-climax, either quanto magis or quanto minus, as here: how much less can I, the feeble one, dispute with Him! &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/9-15.htm">Job 9:15</a>, is best taken, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/5-5.htm">Job 5:5</a>, in the signification quoniam. The part. Poel &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1496;&#1497; we should more correctly translate "my disputant" than "my judge;" it is Poel which Ewald appropriately styles the conjugation of attack: &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1508;&#1496;, judicando vel litigando aliquem petere; comp. Ges. 55, 1. The part. Kal denotes a judge, the part. Poel one who is accuser and judge at the same time. On such Poel-forms from strong roots, vid., on <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/109-10.htm">Psalm 109:10</a>, where wedorschu is to be read, and therefore it is written &#1493;&#1491;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468; in correct Codices. </body></html>
