How vain the enjoyments of time, which we may quite lose while yet time continues! The remembrance of having done our duty will be pleasing afterwards; so will not the remembrance of having got worldly wealth, when it is all lost and gone. Job's complaint of God, as one that could not be appeased and would not relent, was the language of his corruption. There is a Mediator, a Daysman, or Umpire, for us, even God's own beloved Son, who has purchased peace for us with the blood of his cross, who is able to save to the uttermost all who come unto God through him. If we trust in his name, our sins will be buried in the depths of the sea, we shall be washed from all our filthiness, and made whiter than snow, so that none can lay any thing to our charge. We shall be clothed with the robes of righteousness and salvation, adorned with the graces of the Holy Spirit, and presented faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy. May we learn the difference between justifying ourselves, and being thus justified by God himself. Let the tempest-tossed soul consider Job, and notice that others have passed this dreadful gulf; and though they found it hard to believe that God would hear or deliver them, yet he rebuked the storm, and brought them to the desired haven. Resist the devil; give not place to hard thoughts of God, or desperate conclusions about thyself. Come to Him who invites the weary and heavy laden; who promises in nowise to cast them out.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Now my days are swifter than a post - Than a courier, runner, or racer, &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509;  ru&#770;ts. Vulgate, cursore; Septuagint, &#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;  dromeo&#772;s, a racer. The word is not unfrequently applied to the runners or couriers, that carried royal commands in ancient times. It is applied to the mounted couriers of the Persians who carried the royal edicts to the distant provinces, <a href="//biblehub.com/esther/3-13.htm">Esther 3:13</a>, <a href="/esther/3-15.htm">Esther 3:15</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/esther/8-14.htm">Esther 8:14</a>, and to the body-guard and royal messengers of Saul and of David, <a href="/1_samuel/22-17.htm">1 Samuel 22:17</a>; <a href="/2_kings/10-25.htm">2 Kings 10:25</a>. The common rate of traveling in the East is exceedingly slow. The caravans move little more than two miles an hour. Couriers are however, employed who go either on dromedaries, on horses, or on foot, and who travel with great rapidity. Lady Montague says that "after the defeat; at Peterwaradin, they (the couriers on dromedaries) far outran the fleetest horses, and brought the first news of the battle at Belgrade." The messengers in Barbary who carry despatches, it is said, will run one hundred and fifty miles in twenty-four hours (Harmer's Observa. ii. 200, ed. 1808), and it has been said that the messengers among the American savages would run an hundred and twenty miles in the twenty-four hours. In Egypt, it is a common thing for an Arab on foot to accompany a rider, and to keep up with the horse when at full gallop, and to do this for a long time without apparent fatigue. The meaning of Job here is, that his life was short, and that his days were passing swiftly away, not like the slow caravan, but like the most fleet messenger compare the note at <a href="/job/7-6.htm">Job 7:6</a>.<p>They see no good - I am not permitted to enjoy happiness.

In the wide Persian empire such couriers, on dromedaries or on foot, were employed to carry the royal commands to the distant provinces (Es 3:13, 15; 8:14). "My days" are not like the slow caravan, but the fleet post.

Life slips away so fast that before it is well begun, it is ended. Job compares it to the swift passage of the trained runner, or messenger, who carried despatches for kings and other great personages in the olden times (see <a href="/2_chronicles/30-6.htm">2 Chronicles 30:6</a>; <a href="/esther/3-13.htm">Esther 3:13</a>; <a href="/esther/8-10.htm">Esther 8:10, 14</a>). Herodotus says of the trained runners employed by the Persians, "Nothing mortal travels so fast as these Persian messengers" (Herod., 8:98). There is abundant evidence of the employment of such persons in ancient Egypt. <span class="cmt_word">They flee away, they see no good</span>. It seems to Job that his prosperity (<a href="/job/1-2.htm">Job 1:2-5</a>) was only for a moment. He scarcely could look on it before it was gone. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>16  If when I called He really answered,<p>I could not believe that He would hearken to me;<p>17  He would rather crush me in a tempest,<p>And only multiply my wounds without cause;<p>18  He would not suffer me to take my breath,<p>But would fill me with bitter things.<p>19  If it is a question of the strength of the strong - : "Behold here!"<p>And if of right - : "Who will challenge me?"<p>20  Where I in the right, my mouth must condemn me;<p>Were I innocent, He would declare me guilty.<p>The answer of God when called upon, i.e., summoned, is represented in <a href="/job/9-16.htm">Job 9:16</a> as an actual result (praet. followed by fut. consec.), therefore <a href="/job/9-16.htm">Job 9:16</a> cannot be intended to express: I could not believe that He answers me, but: I could not believe that He, the answerer, would hearken to me; His infinite exaltation would not permit such condescension. The &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; which follows, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/9-17.htm">Job 9:17</a>, signifies either quippe qui or quoniam; both shades of meaning are after all blended, as in <a href="/job/9-15.htm">Job 9:15</a>. The question arises here whether &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1507; signifies conterere, or as cognate form with &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1507;, inhiare, - a question also of importance in the exposition of the Protevangelium. There are in all only three passages in which it occurs: here, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>, and <a href="/psalms/139-11.htm">Psalm 139:11</a>. In <a href="/psalms/139-11.htm">Psalm 139:11</a> the meaning conterere is unsuitable, but even the signification inhiare can only be adopted for want of a better: perhaps it may be explained by comparison with &#1510;&#1506;&#1507;, in the sense of obvelare, or as a denominative from &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1507; (the verb of which, &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1507;, is kindred to &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;, &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501;, flare) in the signification obtenebrare. In <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>, if regarded superficially, the meaning inhiare and conterere are alike suitable, but the meaning inhiare deprives that utterance of God of its prophetic character, which has been recognised from the beginning; and the meaning conterere, contundere, is strongly supported by the translations. We decide in favour of this meaning also in the present passage, with the ancient translations (lxx &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c8;&#x3b7;&#837;, Targ. &#1502;&#1491;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1511;, comminuens). Moreover, it is the meaning most generally supported by a comparison with the dialects, whereas the signification inhiare can only be sustained by comparison with &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1507; and the Arabic sa&#770;fa (to sniff, track by scent, to smell); besides, "to assail angrily" (Hirz., Ewald) is an inadmissible contortion of inhiare, which signifies in a hostile sense "to seize abruptly" (Schlottm.), properly to snatch, to desire to seize.<p>Translate therefore: He would crush me in a tempest and multiply (multiplicaret), etc., would not let me take breath (respirare), but (&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, Ges. 155, 1, e. a.) fill me (&#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1506;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;, with Pathach with Rebia mugrasch) with bitter things (&#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1512;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, with Dag. dirimens, which gives the word a more pathetic expression). The meaning of <a href="/job/9-19.htm">Job 9:19</a> is that God stifles the attempt to maintain one's right in the very beginning by His being superior to the creature in strength, and not entering into a dispute with him concerning the right. &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; (for &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; as &#1488;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/15-23.htm">Job 15:23</a>, for &#1488;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;): see, here I am, ready for the contest, is the word of God, similar to quis citare possit me (in <a href="/jeremiah/49-19.htm">Jeremiah 49:19</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/50-44.htm">Jeremiah 50:44</a>), which sounds as an echo of this passage. The creature must always be in the wrong, - a thought true in itself, in connection with which Job forgets that God's right in opposition to the creature is also always the true objective right. &#1508;&#1468;&#1497;, with suffix, accented to indicate its logical connection, as <a href="/job/15-6.htm">Job 15:6</a> : my own mouth.<p>(Note: Olshausen's conjecture, &#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493;, lessens the difficulty in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/34-16.htm">Isaiah 34:16</a>, but here it destroys the strong expression of the violence done to the moral consciousness.)<p>In &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497; the Chirek of the Hiphil is shortened to a Sheva, as <a href="/1_samuel/17-25.htm">1 Samuel 17:25</a>; vid., Ges. 53, rem. 4. The subject is God, not "my mouth" (Schlottm.): supposing that I were innocent, He would put me down as one morally wrong and to be rejected. </body></html>
