How vain the enjoyments of time, which we may quite lose while yet time continues! The remembrance of having done our duty will be pleasing afterwards; so will not the remembrance of having got worldly wealth, when it is all lost and gone. Job's complaint of God, as one that could not be appeased and would not relent, was the language of his corruption. There is a Mediator, a Daysman, or Umpire, for us, even God's own beloved Son, who has purchased peace for us with the blood of his cross, who is able to save to the uttermost all who come unto God through him. If we trust in his name, our sins will be buried in the depths of the sea, we shall be washed from all our filthiness, and made whiter than snow, so that none can lay any thing to our charge. We shall be clothed with the robes of righteousness and salvation, adorned with the graces of the Holy Spirit, and presented faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy. May we learn the difference between justifying ourselves, and being thus justified by God himself. Let the tempest-tossed soul consider Job, and notice that others have passed this dreadful gulf; and though they found it hard to believe that God would hear or deliver them, yet he rebuked the storm, and brought them to the desired haven. Resist the devil; give not place to hard thoughts of God, or desperate conclusions about thyself.

If my sufferings were lightened, and I could approach the question with the rigor of health and the power of reasoning unweakened by calamity, I could then do justice to the views which I entertain.

Not his government over him, of which the rod or sceptre is an ensign, Job did not want to be freed from that; but, his rod of affliction, or stroke, as the Targum, the stroke of his hand, which, though a fatherly chastisement, lay heavy upon him, and depressed his spirits; so that he could not, while it was on him, reason so freely about things as he thought he could if it was removed, and for which he here prays: <p>and let not his fear terrify me; not the fear of him as a father, which is not terrifying, but the fear of him as a judge; the terror of his majesty, the dread of his wrath and vengeance, the fearful apprehensions he had of him as a God of strict justice; that would by no means clear the guilty, yea, would not hold him innocent, though he was with respect to the charge of his friends; being now without those views of him as a God gracious and merciful; to these words Elihu seeks to have respect, <a href="/job/33-6.htm">Job 33:6</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear terrify me:</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/job/9.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">34</span>.

In the midst of his present sufferings he has entirely forgotten his former prosperity; it is no happiness to him, because the very enjoyment of it makes the loss of it more grievous to bear. The days of prosperity are gone, have passed swiftly away without &#1496;&#1493;&#1489;&#1492;, i.e., without lasting prosperity. They have been swifter &#1512;&#1509; &#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;. By reference to <a href="//biblehub.com/job/7-6.htm">Job 7:6</a>, this might be considered as a figure borrowed from the weaver's loom, since in the Coptic the threads of the weft (fila subteminis) which are wound round the shuttle are called "runners" (vid., Ges. Thesaurus); but Rosenmller has correctly observed that, in order to describe the fleetness of his life, Job brings together that which is swiftest on land (the runners or couriers), in water (fast-sailing ships), and in the air (the swooping eagle). &#1506;&#1501;, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/9-26.htm">Job 9:26</a>, signifies, in comparison with, aeque ac. But we possess only a rather uncertain tradition as to the kind of vessels meant by &#1488;&#1489;&#1492; &#1488;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514;. Jerome translates, after the Targ.: naves poma portantes, by which one may understand the small vessels, according to Edrisi, common on the Dead Sea, in which corn and different kinds of fruits were carried from Zoar to Jericho and to other regions of the Jordan (Stickel, S. 267); but if &#1488;&#1489;&#1492; were connected with &#1488;&#1489;, we might rather expect &#1488;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492;, after the form &#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1492; (from &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;), instead of &#1488;&#1489;&#1492;. Others derive the word from &#1488;&#1489;&#1492;, avere: ships of desire, i.e., full-rigged and ready for sea (Gecatilia in Ges. Thes. suppl. p. 62), or struggling towards the goal (Kimchi), or steering towards (Zamora), and consequently hastening to (Symmachuc, &#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;), the harbour; but independently of the explanation not being suited to the description, it should then be accented beh, after the form &#1504;&#1491;&#1492;, &#1511;&#1510;&#1492;, instead of bh. The explanation, ships of hostility (Syr.),<p>(Note: Luther also perhaps understood pirate ships, when he translated, "wie die starcken Schiff.")<p>i.e., ships belonging to pirates or freebooters, privateers, which would suit the subject well, is still less admissible with the present pointing of the text, as it must then be &#1488;&#1489;&#1492; (&#1488;&#1497;&#1489;&#1492;), with which the Egyptian uba, against, and adverse (contrarius), may be compared. According to Abulwalid (Parchon, Raschi), &#1488;&#1489;&#1492; is the name of a large river near the scene of the book of Job; which may be understood as either the Babylonian name for river Arab. 'bby, or the Abyssinian name of the Nile, ab; and &#1488;&#1489;&#1492; may be compared with &#1500;&#1489;&#1504;&#1492; in relation to the Arabic, lubna. But a far more satisfactory explanation is the one now generally received, according to the comparison with the Arabic aba&#770;'un, a reed (whence abaa-t-un, a reed, a so-called n. unitatis): ships made from reeds, like &#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1488; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/18-2.htm">Isaiah 18:2</a>, vessels of papyrus, &#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;. In such small ships, with Egyptian tackling, they used to travel as far as Taprobane. These canoes were made to fold together, plicatiles, so that they could be carried past the cataracts; Heliodorus describes them as &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;.<p>(Note: There is no Egyptian word which can be compared to &#1488;&#1489;&#1492;, whereas han (hani) or an (ana) in Egyptian, like the Hebrew &#1488;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492;, means a ship (vid., Chabas, Le Papyrus magique Harris, p. 246, No. 826, cf. pp. 33, 47); it is written with the sign for set  equals  downwards, since they fastened a stone at the front of the vessel, as was even known to Herodotus, in order to accelerate its speed in descending the river. From this one might conjecture for the passage before us &#1488;&#1489;&#1503; &#1488;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514;  equals  swift sailers.)<p>The third figure is the eagle, which swoops down upon its prey; &#1496;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;, like Chaldee &#1496;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;, by which the Targ. translates &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;, <a href="/habakkuk/1-8.htm">Habakkuk 1:8</a>; Grtz' conjecture of &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1496; (which is intended to mean flutters) is superfluous. Just as unnecessary is it, with Olshausen, to change &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497; &#1488;&#1501; into &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;&#1497; &#1488;&#1501;: "if my saying (thinking)" is equivalent to, "as often as I say (think)." &#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; is here (as in the German phrase, ein Gesicht machen) an ill-humoured, distorted, wry face. When Job desires to give up this look of suffering and be cheerful (&#1492;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497;&#1490;, like <a href="//biblehub.com/job/10-20.htm">Job 10:20</a>, hilaritatem prae se ferre, vultum hilarem induere), the certainty that he is not favoured of God, and consequently that he cannot be delivered from his sufferings, all his anguish in spite of his struggles against it comes ever afresh before his mind. It is scarcely necessary to remark that &#1514;&#1504;&#1511;&#1504;&#1497; is addressed to God, not to Bildad. It is important to notice that Job does not speak of God without at the same time looking up to Him as in prayer. Although he feels rejected of God, he still remains true to God. In the following strophe he continues to complain of God, but without denying Him. </body></html>
