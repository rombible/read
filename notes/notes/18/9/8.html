Before him he pleaded guilty of sins more than could be counted; and if God should contend with him in judgment, he could not justify one out of a thousand, of all the thoughts, words, and actions of his life; therefore he deserved worse than all his present sufferings. When Job mentions the wisdom and power of God, he forgets his complaints. We are unfit to judge of God's proceedings, because we know not what he does, or what he designs. God acts with power which no creature can resist.

So it is in the Hebrew. It means the "high waves;" that is, he walks upon the waves of the ocean when lifted up by a storm. This is spoken of here as a proof of the greatness of God; and the meaning of all is, that he is seen in the storm, in the heaving ocean, when the heavens are black with tempest, and when the earth is convulsed. It may be added here, that the Lord Jesus walked amidst the howling winds on the lake, and thus gave evidence that he was God; <a href="/matthew/14-25.htm">Matthew 14:25</a>. "The Egyptian hieroglyphic for what was not possible to be done, was a man walking on the water." Burder. Dr. Good, and some others, render this, "on the mountains." But the more correct rendering is given in the common version. The Hebrew word rendered "waves" (&#1489;&#1502;&#1492;  ba&#770;ma&#770;h) indeed properly means a height, a lofty place, a mountain; but the comparison of waves with a mountain, is common in all languages. So we speak of waves "mountain-high," or as high as mountains. So Virgil, Aeneid i.105,<p>Insequitur cumulo praeruptus aquae mons.<p>Similar to this, is the expression occurring in Homer, &#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; &#x3b9;&#787;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b1; &#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;  kumata isa oressin; and so Apollonius, i. 521 - &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; chalos akron.

But throughout it is not so much God's creating, as His governing, power over nature that is set forth. A storm seems a struggle between Nature and her Lord! Better, therefore, "Who boweth the heavens alone," without help of any other. God descends from the bowed-down heaven to the earth (Ps 18:9). The storm, wherein the clouds descend, suggests this image. In the descent of the vault of heaven, God has come down from His high throne and walks majestically over the mountain waves (Hebrew, "heights"), as a conqueror taming their violence. So "tread upon" (De 33:29; Am 4:13; Mt 14:26).

The heavens are regarded as spread out over the whole earth, like a curtain or awning over a tent, everywhere overshadowing and promoting it. This "stretching" or "spreading out" is felt to be one of the mightiest and most marvellous of the Creater's works, and is constantly put forward in Scripture as a special evidence of his omnipotence (see, besides the pasages above quoted, <a href="/isaiah/42-5.htm">Isaiah 42:5</a>; <a href="/isaiah/44-24.htm">Isaiah 44:24</a>; <a href="/isaiah/45-12.htm">Isaiah 45:12</a>; It. 13; <a href="/jeremiah/10-12.htm">Jeremiah 10:12</a>).

The chief thought of Bildad's speech was, that God does not pervert what is right. Certainly (&#1488;&#1502;&#1504;&#1501;, scilicet, nimirum, like <a href="/job/12-2.htm">Job 12:2</a>), - says Job, as he ironically confirms this maxim of Bildad's, - it is so: what God does is always right, because God does it; how could man maintain that he is in the right in opposition to God! If God should be willing to enter into controversy with man, he would not be able to give Him information on one of a thousand subjects that might be brought into discussion; he would be so confounded, so disarmed, by reason of the infinite distance of the feeble creature from his Creator. The attributes (<a href="/job/9-4.htm">Job 9:4</a>) belong not to man (Olshausen), but to God, as <a href="/job/36-5.htm">Job 36:5</a>.
