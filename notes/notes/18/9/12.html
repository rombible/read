Before him he pleaded guilty of sins more than could be counted; and if God should contend with him in judgment, he could not justify one out of a thousand, of all the thoughts, words, and actions of his life; therefore he deserved worse than all his present sufferings. When Job mentions the wisdom and power of God, he forgets his complaints. We are unfit to judge of God's proceedings, because we know not what he does, or what he designs. God acts with power which no creature can resist. Those who think they have strength enough to help others, will not be able to help themselves against it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Behold, he taketh away - Property, friends, or life.<p>Who can hinder him? - Margin, turn him away. Or, rather, "who shall cause him to restore?" that is, who can bring back what he takes away? He is so mighty, that what he removes, it is impossible for us to recover.<p>Who will say unto him, What doest thou? - A similar expression occurs in <a href="/daniel/4-35.htm">Daniel 4:35</a>. The meaning is plain. God has a right to remove any thing which we possess. Our friends, property, health, and lives, are his gift, and he has a right to them all. When he takes them away, he is but taking that which is his own, and which has been lent to us for a little time, and which he has a right to remove when it seems good to him. This truth Job fully admits, and in the calm contemplation of all his losses and his sorrows, he acknowledges that God had a right to do as he had done; see note, <a href="/job/1-21.htm">Job 1:21</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12.

There are some things God never takes away from his people; he never takes away his love from them, he always rests in that towards them, let them be in what condition they will; he never takes away his grace from them, when once bestowed on them, or wrought in them; he never takes away his special gifts of grace, particularly the unspeakable gift of his son Christ Jesus, which is that good part, when chosen, which shall not be taken away; nor any of the spiritual blessings wherewith they are blessed in Christ; these are irreversible and irrevocable: but temporal blessings he takes away at pleasure; so he had taken away the children, the servants of Job, his substance, wealth, and riches, and also his bodily health, to which he may have a particular respect; yea, when it pleases him, he takes a man out of the world, as the Targum and Gersom interpret it: <p>who can hinder him? he does what he pleases in heaven and earth; his will is irresistible, his power is uncontrollable; there is no turning his mind, nor staying his hand, nor turning it back; when he works, none can let or hinder. Mr. Broughton translates it, "who shall make him restore?" (l) if a man takes away what he has no right to, he may be obliged by law to restore it; but whatever God takes away he has a right unto, be it relations and friends, health or wealth; if he pleases he can restore, and does; and as he did to Job, to whom he after gave twice as much as he had before; but then he is not obliged to do it, none can force him to it: <p>who will say unto him, what doest thou? not one that knows what God is, or that knows himself a creature of his; no person will choose or dare to ask what God does, or why he does this and not another thing, or why this in the manner he does it; for he gives no account of his matters to the sons of men, nor is he obliged to it, and it would be insolent in them to require it, see <a href="/job/33-13.htm">Job 33:13</a>; this expresses his sovereignty. <p>(l) So Beza, Pagninus, Montanus, Bolducius, Junius &amp; Tremellius, Cocceius. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? <span class="cverse3">{f}</span> who will say unto him, What doest thou?</span><p>(f) He shows that when God executes his power, he does it justly, as no one can control him.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/job/9.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">12</span>.

The expression is much stronger than that used in <a href="/job/1-21.htm">Job 1:21</a>. Job seems to be smarting under the recollection of all that he has lost, and takes an aggrieved tone. <span class="cmt_word">Who can hinder him?</span> (comp. <a href="/isaiah/45-9.htm">Isaiah 45:9</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/18-6.htm">Jeremiah 18:6</a>; Romans 19:20). <span class="cmt_word">Who will say unto him, What doest thou?</span> To have to do with such an irresistible Being, alone in his might, would indeed be terrible if, while absolutely powerful, unchecked and uncontrolled from without, he were not also absolutely good, and therefore controlled and checked by a law from within. This, however, Job, in his present mood, does not seem clearly to see. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>  5  Who removeth mountains without their knowing,<p>That He hath overturned them in His wrath;<p>  6  Who causeth the earth to shake out of its place,<p>And its pillars to tremble;<p>  7  Who commandeth the sun, and it riseth not,<p>And sealeth up the stars.<p>&#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468; &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; (<a href="/job/9-5.htm">Job 9:5</a>) may also be translated: without one's perceiving it or knowing why; but it is more natural to take the mountains as the subject. &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, quod, that (not "as," Ewald, 333, a), after &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;, as <a href="/ezekiel/20-26.htm">Ezekiel 20:26</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/8-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:12</a>. Even the lofty mountains are quite unconscious of the change which He effects on them in a moment. Before they are aware that it is being done, it is over, as the praet. implies; the destructive power of His anger is irresistible, and effects its purpose suddenly. He causes the earth to start up from its place (comp. <a href="/isaiah/13-13.htm">Isaiah 13:13</a>) which it occupies in space (<a href="/job/26-7.htm">Job 26:7</a>); and by being thus set in motion by Him, its pillars tremble, i.e., its internal foundations (<a href="/psalms/104-5.htm">Psalm 104:5</a>), which are removed from human perception (<a href="/job/38-6.htm">Job 38:6</a>). It is not the highest mountains, which are rather called the pillars, as it were the supports, of heaven (<a href="/job/26-11.htm">Job 26:11</a>), that are meant. By the same almighty will He disposes of the sun and stars. The sun is here called &#1495;&#1512;&#1505; (as in <a href="/judges/14-18.htm">Judges 14:18</a> &#1495;&#1512;&#1505;&#1492; with unaccented ah, and as <a href="/isaiah/19-18.htm">Isaiah 19:18</a> &#8219;Ir ha-Heres is a play upon &#1492;&#1495;&#1512;&#1505; &#1506;&#1497;&#1512;, &#x397;&#788;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;), perhaps from the same root as &#1495;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509;, one of the poetical names of gold. At His command the sun rises not, and He seals up the stars, i.e., conceals them behind thick clouds, so that the day becomes dark, and the night is not made bright. One may with Schultens think of the Flood, or with Warburton of the Egyptian darkness, and the standing still of the sun at the word of Joshua; but these are only single historical instances of a fact here affirmed as a universal experience of the divine power. </body></html>
