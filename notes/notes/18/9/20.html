Job begins to manifest a disposition to condemn God, that he may justify himself, for which he is afterwards reproved. Still Job knew so much of himself, that he durst not stand a trial. If we say, We have no sin, we not only deceive ourselves, but we affront God; for we sin in saying so, and give the lie to the Scripture. But Job reflected on God's goodness and justice in saying his affliction was without cause.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>If I justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me - That is, referring still to the form of a judicial trial, if I should undertake to manage my own cause, I should lay myself open to condemnation even in my argument on the subject, and should show that I was far from the perfection which I had undertaken to maintain. By passionate expressions; by the language of complaint and murmuring; by a want of suitable reverence; by showing my ignorance of the principles of the divine government; by arguments unsound and based on false positions; or by contradictions and self-refutations, I should show that my position was untenable, and that God was right in charging me with guilt. In some or in all of these ways Job felt, probably, that in an argument before God he would be self-condemned, and that even an attempt to justify himself, or to prove that he was innocent, would prove that he was guilty. And is it not always so? Did a man ever yet undertake to repel the charges of guilt brought against him by his Maker, and to prove that he was innocent, in which he did not himself show the truth of what he was denying? Did not his false views of God and of his law; his passion, complaining, and irreverence; his unwillingness to admit the force of the palpable considerations urged to prove that he was guilty, demonstrate that he was at heart a sinner, and that he was insubmissive and rebellious? The very attempt to enter into such an argument against God, shows that the heart is not right; and the manner in which such an argument is commonly conducted demonstrates that he who does it is sinful.<p>If I say, I am perfect - Should I attempt to maintain such an argument, the very attempt would prove that my heart is perverse and evil. It would do this because God had adjudged the contrary, and because such an effort would show an insubmissive and a proud heart. This passage shows that Job did not regard himself as a man absolutely free from sin. He was indeed said <a href="/job/1-1.htm">Job 1:1</a> to be "perfect and upright;" but this verse proves that that testimony in regard to him was not inconsistent with his consciousness of guilt. See the notes at that verse. And is not the claim to absolute perfection in this world always a proof that the heart is perverse? Does not the very setting up of such a claim in fact indicate a pride of heart, a self-satisfaction, and an ignorance of the true state of the soul, which is full demonstration that the heart is far from being perfect? God adjudges man to be exceedingly sinful; and if I do not mistake the meaning of the Scriptures, this is his testimony of every human heart - totally until renewed - partially ever onward until death. If this be the account in the Scriptures, then the claim to absolute perfection is prima facie, if not full proof, that the heart is in some way perverse. It has come to a different conclusion from that of God. It sets up an argument against him - and there can be no more certain proof of a lack of perfection than such an attempt. There is in this verse an energy in the original which is very feebly conveyed by our translation. It is the language of strong and decided indignation at the very idea of asserting that he was perfect. &#1514;&#1501; &#1488;&#1504;&#1497;  ta&#770;m 'a&#774;n&#305;&#770;y - "perfect I!" or, "I perfect! The thought is absurd! It can only prove that I am perverse to attempt to set up any such claim!" Stuhlman renders this,<p>"However good I may be, I must condemn myself;<p>However free from guilt, I must call myself evil:"<p>And explains it as meaning, "God can through the punishments which he inflicts constrain me to confess, against the clear consciousness of my innocence, that I am guilty." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20. it&#8212;(Job 15:6; Lu 19:22); or "He," God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/job/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> If I plead against God mine own righteousness and innocency, God is so infinitely wise and just, that he will find sufficient matter of condemnation from my own words, though spoken with all possible care and circumspection; or he will discover so much wickedness in me of which I was not aware, that I shall be forced to join with him in condemning myself. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">If I say, I am perfect; </span> if I were perfect in my own opinion; if I thought myself completely righteous and faultless, it, i.e. my own mouth, as he now said, or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">he, </span> i.e. God, who is easily understood by comparing this with the former verses, where the same he is oft mentioned, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">shall also prove me perverse.</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/job/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>If I justify myself,....

Since he could not <span class="accented">wholly</span> justify himself. "All men have sinned, and come short of the glory of God" (<a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a>). Job has already admitted the utterance of "rash words" (<a href="/job/6-3.htm">Job 6:3</a>), and, at least hypothetically, that he "has sinned" (<a href="/job/7-20.htm">Job 7:20</a>), and needs "pardon" for his "transgression" (Job 7:24). Job, if he tried to "justify himself," would have to acknowledge such shortcomings, such imperfections, such sins - at any rate, of infirmity - as would make his attempted justification a real self-condemnation. <span class="cmt_word">If I say, I am perfect, it shall also prove me perverse</span>; rather, <span class="accented">even were</span> I <span class="accented">perfect</span> <span class="accented">it</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> my mouth) <span class="accented">would prove me perverse</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> supposing I were actually perfect, and tried to prove it, my speech would be so hesitating and confused, that I should only seem to be perverse. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>11  Behold, He goeth by me and I see not,<p>And passeth by and I perceive Him not.<p>12  Behold, He taketh away, who will hold Him back?<p>Who will say to Him: What doest Thou?<p>13  Eloah restraineth not His anger,<p>The helpers of Rahab stoop under Him - <p>14  How much less that I should address Him,<p>That I should choose the right words in answer to Him;<p>15  Because, though I were right, I could not answer, - <p>To Him as my Judge I must make supplication.<p>God works among men, as He works in nature, with a supreme control over all, invisibly, irresistibly, and is not responsible to any being (<a href="/isaiah/45-9.htm">Isaiah 45:9</a>). He does not turn or restrain His anger without having accomplished His purpose. This is a proposition which, thus broadly expressed, is only partially true, as is evident from <a href="/psalms/78-38.htm">Psalm 78:38</a>. The helpers of Rahab must bow themselves under Him. It is not feasible to understand this in a general sense, as meaning those who are ready with boastful arrogance to yield succour to any against God. The form of expression which follows in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/9-14.htm">Job 9:14</a>, "much less I," supports the assumption that &#1512;&#1492;&#1489; &#1506;&#1494;&#1512;&#1497; refers to some well-known extraordinary example of wicked enterprise which had been frustrated, notwithstanding the gigantic strength by which it was supported; and &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; may be translated by the present tense, since a familiar fact is used as synonymous with the expression of an universal truth. Elsewhere Rahab as a proper name denotes Egypt (<a href="/psalms/87-4.htm">Psalm 87:4</a>), but it cannot be so understood here, because direct references to events in the history of Israel are contrary to the character of the book, which, with remarkable consistency, avoids everything that is at all Israelitish. But how has Egypt obtained the name of Rahab? It is evident from <a href="/isaiah/30-7.htm">Isaiah 30:7</a> that it bears this name with reference to its deeds of prowess; but from <a href="/psalms/89-11.htm">Psalm 89:11</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/51-9.htm">Isaiah 51:9</a>, it is evident that Rahab properly denotes a sea-monster, which has become the symbol of Egypt, like tannn and leviathan elsewhere. This signification of the word is also supported by <a href="//biblehub.com/job/26-12.htm">Job 26:12</a>, where the lxx actually translate &#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, as here with remarkable freedom, &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0; &#787; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0; &#787; &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;. It is not clear whether these "sea-monsters" denote rebels cast down into the sea beneath the sky, or chained upon the sky; but at any rate the consciousness of a distinct mythological meaning in &#1512;&#1492;&#1489; &#1506;&#1494;&#1512;&#1497; is expressed by this translation (as also in the still freer translation of Jerome, et sub quo curvantur qui portant orbem); probably a myth connected with such names of the constellations as &#x39a;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; and &#x3a0;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; (Ewald, Hirz., Schlottm.). The poesy of the book of Job even in other places does not spurn mythological allusions; and the phrase before us reminds one of the Hindu myth of Indras' victory over the dark demon Vritras, who tries to delay the descent of rain, and over his helpers. In Vritras, as in &#1512;&#1492;&#1489;, there is the idea of hostile resistance.<p>Job compares himself, the feeble one, to these mythical titanic powers in <a href="/job/9-14.htm">Job 9:14</a>. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1488;&#1507; (properly: even that), or even &#1488;&#1507; alone (<a href="/job/4-19.htm">Job 4:19</a>), signifies, according as the connection introduces a climax or anti-climax, either quanto magis or quanto minus, as here: how much less can I, the feeble one, dispute with Him! &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/9-15.htm">Job 9:15</a>, is best taken, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/5-5.htm">Job 5:5</a>, in the signification quoniam. The part. Poel &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1496;&#1497; we should more correctly translate "my disputant" than "my judge;" it is Poel which Ewald appropriately styles the conjugation of attack: &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1508;&#1496;, judicando vel litigando aliquem petere; comp. Ges. 55, 1. The part. Kal denotes a judge, the part. Poel one who is accuser and judge at the same time. On such Poel-forms from strong roots, vid., on <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/109-10.htm">Psalm 109:10</a>, where wedorschu is to be read, and therefore it is written &#1493;&#1491;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468; in correct Codices. </body></html>
