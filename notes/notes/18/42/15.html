His troubles began in Satan's malice, which God restrained; his restoration began in God's mercy, which Satan could not oppose. Mercy did not return when Job was disputing with his friends, but when he was praying for them. God is served and pleased with our warm devotions, not with our warm disputes. God doubled Job's possessions. We may lose much for the Lord, but we shall not lose any thing by him. Whether the Lord gives us health and temporal blessings or not, if we patiently suffer according to his will, in the end we shall be happy. Job's estate increased. The blessing of the Lord makes rich; it is he that gives us power to get wealth, and gives success in honest endeavours. The last days of a good man sometimes prove his best, his last works his best works, his last comforts his best comforts; for his path, like that of the morning light, shines more and more unto the perfect day.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/42.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And their father gave them inheritance among their brethren - This is mentioned as a proof of his special regard, and is also recorded because it was not common. Among the Hebrews the daughter inherited only in the case where there was no son, <a href="/numbers/27-8.htm">Numbers 27:8</a>. The property was divided equally among the sons, with the exception that the oldest received a double portion; see Jahn's "Bib. Arch." section 168. This custom, prevailing still extensively in the East, it seems existed in the time of Job, and it is mentioned as a remarkable circumstance that he made his daughters heirs to his property with their brothers. It would also be rather implied in the passage before us that they were equal heirs. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/42.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15. inheritance among &#8230; brethren&#8212;An unusual favor in the East to daughters, who, in the Jewish law, only inherited, if there were no sons (Nu 27:8), a proof of wealth and unanimity.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/job/42.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Gave his daughters a share, and possibly an equal share, with his sons in his inheritance; which in so plentiful an estate he might easily do, especially to such amiable sisters, without the envy of their brethren; and which peradventure he did to oblige them to settle themselves amongst their brethren, and to marry into their own religious kindred, not to strangers, who in those times were generally swallowed up in the gulf of idolatry. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/job/42.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of Job,.... Either in the whole world, which is not improbable: or it may be rather in the land or country in which they dwelt; and which may be gathered from their names, as before observed. The people of God, and children of Christ, the antitype of Job, are all fair, and there is no spot in them; a perfection of beauty, perfectly comely, through the comeliness of Christ put upon them, and are without spot or wrinkle, or any such thing; <p>and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren; which was done not on account of their beauty or virtue; nor is this observed so much to show the great riches of Job, that he could give his daughters as much as his sons, as his impartiality to his children, and his strict justice and equity in distributing his substance to them all alike, making no difference between male and female. And so in Christ, the antitype of Job, there is neither male nor female, no difference between them, <a href="//biblehub.com/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>, but being all children, they are heirs, heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ, and equally partake of the same inheritance with the saints in light, <a href="/romans/8-17.htm">Romans 8:17</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/42.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of Job: and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/job/42.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">15</span>. <span class="ital">inheritance among their brethren</span>] The Hebrew practice was that the daughters inherited only when there was no son, <a href="/numbers/27-1.htm" title="Then came the daughters of Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of Manasseh the son of Joseph: and these are the names of his daughters; Mahlah, Noah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Tirzah.">Numbers 27:1</a> <span class="ital">seq</span>.

Beauty has always been highly valued in the East; and Job would feel himself highly favoured in having three beautiful daughters.
