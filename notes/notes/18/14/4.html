But, remember, this is not my peculiar case, but the common lot of every man, who descended from sinful parents, and, being infected with original corruption, must unavoidably be unclean. Why, then, dost thou inflict such peculiar and extraordinary judgments upon me for that which is common to all men? And although my natural corruption do not excuse my actual sins, yet I hope it may procure some mitigation of my punishment, and move thy divine pity to deal less severely with me. Observe, reader, clean children can no more come from unclean parents, nor clean performances from an unclean principle, than pure streams can proceed from an impure spring, or grapes from thorns. Our habitual corruption is derived, with our nature, from our progenitors, and is therefore bred in the bone: and our blood is not only attainted by a legal conviction, but tainted with an hereditary disease. And hence flow all actual transgressions, which are the natural product of habitual corruption. This holy Job here laments, as all that are sanctified do, tracing the streams up to the fountain. The Chaldee paraphrase reads this verse, <span class="ital">Who can make a man clean that is polluted with sin? Cannot one? that is, God: </span>or, <span class="ital">who but God, who is one, and will spare him? </span>God can change the skin of the Ethiopian, and to him we ought to direct our prayer, saying, It is the prerogative of thy grace to bring a clean thing out of an unclean, and that grace I humbly implore. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/job/14.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>14:1-6 Job enlarges upon the condition of man, addressing himself also to God. Every man of Adam's fallen race is short-lived. All his show of beauty, happiness, and splendour falls before the stroke of sickness or death, as the flower before the scythe; or passes away like the shadow. How is it possible for a man's conduct to be sinless, when his heart is by nature unclean? Here is a clear proof that Job understood and believed the doctrine of original sin. He seems to have intended it as a plea, why the Lord should not deal with him according to his own works, but according to His mercy and grace. It is determined, in the counsel and decree of God, how long we shall live. Our times are in his hands, the powers of nature act under him; in him we live and move. And it is very useful to reflect seriously on the shortness and uncertainty of human life, and the fading nature of all earthly enjoyments. But it is still more important to look at the cause, and remedy of these evils. Until we are born of the Spirit, no spiritually good thing dwells in us, or can proceed from us. Even the little good in the regenerate is defiled with sin. We should therefore humble ourselves before God, and cast ourselves wholly on the mercy of God, through our Divine Surety. We should daily seek the renewing of the Holy Ghost, and look to heaven as the only place of perfect holiness and happiness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Who can bring a clean - thing "out of an unclean?" This is evidently a proverb or an adage; but its connection here is not very apparent. Probably, however, it is designed as a plea of mitigation for his conscious frailties and infirmities. He could not but admit that he had faults. But he asks, how could it be expected to be otherwise? He belonged to a race that was sinful and depraved. Connected with such a race, how could it be otherwise than that he should be prone to evil? Why then did God follow him with so much severity, and hold him with a grasp so close and so unrelenting? Why did he treat him as if he ought to be expected to be perfectly pure, or as if it were reasonable to suppose he would be otherwise than unholy? This passage is of great value as showing the early opinion of the world in regard to the native character of man. The sentiment was undoubtedly common - so common as to have passed into a proverb - that man was a sinner; and that it could not be expected that anyone of the race should be pure and holy.<p>The sentiment is as true as it is obvious - like will beget like all over the world. The nature of the lion, the tiger, the hyaena, the serpent is propagated, and so the same thing is true of man. It is a great law, that the offspring will resemble the parentage; and as the offspring of the lion is not a lamb but a young lion; of a wolf is not a kid but a young wolf, so the offspring of man is not an angel, but is a man with the same nature, the same moral character, the same proneness to evil with the parent. The Chaldee renders this: "Who will give one pure from a man polluted in sin, except God, who is one, and who forgiveth him?" But this is manifestly a departure from the sense of the passage. Jerome, however, has adopted nearly the same translation. As a historical record, this passage proves that the doctrine of original sin was early held in the world. Still it is true that the same great law prevails, that the off-spring of woman is a sinner - no matter where he may be born, or in what circumstances he may be placed. No art, no philosophy, no system of religion can prevent the operation of this great law under which we live, and by which we die; compare the notes at <a href="/romans/5-19.htm">Romans 5:19</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4.

Either produce a clean person from an unclean one: it is not to be expected that one, perfectly free from sin, should be generated by, or brought out of, one that is defiled with it; which is the case of all men; the first man, though made upright, sinned, and by sinning defiled himself, and all human nature in him: and so those that immediately descended from him were polluted likewise, and so on in all generations, every man being conceived and shaped in iniquity; so that it is not possible that man that is born of a woman, sinful and unclean, should be clean himself, or be free from sin; by which it is manifest, that the sinfulness of human nature is unavoidable; it is natural and necessary, and cannot be otherwise, such being the case and circumstances of immediate parents, from whom men descend; and that this is the case of all men that come into the world by ordinary and natural generation; there is none righteous or pure from sin: no, <p>not one; and things being so, Job thought it hard that he should be singled out, and so severely chastised, when the sinfulness of nature was from and by his birth, and was natural and unavoidable, and when there was not a single person on earth free from it. There never was but one instance of one clean being brought out of an unclean person, and that was our Lord Jesus Christ of the Virgin Mary; which was not in the ordinary way of generation, but by a supernatural and extraordinary production of his human nature, through the power of the Holy Ghost, whereby it escaped the original contagion and pollution of mankind: or else, in consequence of this, the sense is, who can bring forth or produce a good work from an impure person? or how can it be expected that a man that is defiled with sin should do a good work perfectly pure? for there is not even a just and good man that doth good and sinneth not; and much less is it to be looked for, that men in a mere state of nature, that are as they come into the world, sinful and impure, should ever be able to perform good works; it may as well be thought that grapes are to be gathered of thorns, or figs of thistles; men must be born again, created in Christ Jesus, have faith in him, and the Spirit of God in them, before they can do that which is truly good from right principles, and with right views; and man at most and best must be an imperfect creature, and deficient in his duty, and cannot bear to be strictly examined, and rigorously prosecuted: or the meaning is, "who can make" (g) an unclean man a clean one? "no, not one"; a man cannot make himself clean by anything he can do, by his repentance and humiliation, by his good works, duties, and services; none can do this but God; and to this sense some render the words, "who can--is there one" (h)? there is, that is, God, he can do it, and he only: though men are exhorted to cleanse themselves, this does not suppose a power in them to do it; this is only designed to convince them of the necessity of being cleansed, and to awaken a concern for it; and such as are made sensible thereof will apply to God to purge them, and make them clean, and create a clean heart within them: and this God has promised to do, and does do; he sprinkles the clean water of his grace, and purifies the heart by faith in the blood of Jesus, which cleanses from all sin, and is the fountain opened to wash in for sin and uncleanness; the Targum is, <p>"who can give a clean thing out of a man that is defiled with sins, except God who is one, and can forgive him?'' <p>none can pardon sin but God, or justify a sinner besides him; and he can do both in a way of justice, upon the foot of the blood and righteousness of Christ. <p>(g)  "quis potest facere?"

The question of astonishment in <span class="ital"><a href="/job/14-3.htm" title="And does you open your eyes on such an one, and bring me into judgment with you?">Job 14:3</a></span> supported by reference to the universal sinfulness of man.

Job throws his idea of the universal uncleanness of man, and that there is not one without sin, into the form of a wish that it were otherwise. If the race of men were not universally infected with sin, which each individual inherits by belonging to the race, God’s stringent treatment of the individuals would not be so hard to understand. For similar ideas of the universality of the sinfulness of mankind cf. <a href="/genesis/6-5.htm" title="And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.">Genesis 6:5</a>; <a href="/isaiah/6-5.htm" title="Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the middle of a people of unclean lips: for my eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts.">Isaiah 6:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/51-5.htm" title="Behold, I was shaped in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me.">Psalm 51:5</a>, also the words of Eliphaz ch. <a href="/job/4-17.htm" title="Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his maker?">Job 4:17</a> <span class="ital">seq</span>.

It is scarcely true to say that "the fact of original sin is thus distinctly recognized" ('Speaker's Commentary,' vol. 4. p. 61). Original uncleanness and infirmity are recognized; but the uncleanness is material, and removable by material expiation (<a href="/leviticus/12-2.htm">Leviticus 12:2-8</a>). It is rather man's weakness than his sinfulness that is here under discussion. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/13.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>26  For Thou decreest bitter things against me,<p>And causest me to possess the iniquities of my youth,<p>27  And puttest my feet in the stocks,<p>And observest all my ways.<p>Thou makest for thyself a circle round the soles of my feet,<p>28  Round one who moulders away as worm-eaten,<p>As a garment that the moth gnaweth.<p>He is conscious of having often prayed: "Remember not the sins of my youth, and my transgressions: according to Thy mercy remember Thou me," <a href="/psalms/25-7.htm">Psalm 25:7</a>; and still he can only regard his affliction as the inheritance (i.e., entailed upon him by sins not repented of) of the sins of his youth, since he has no sins of his mature years that would incur wrath, to reproach himself with. He does not know how to reconcile with the justice of God the fact that He again records against him sins, the forgiveness of which he implores soon after their commission, and decrees (&#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1489;, as <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/149-9.htm">Psalm 149:9</a>, and as used elsewhere in the book of Job with reference to the recording of judgment) for him on account of them such bitter punishment (&#1502;&#1512;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, amara, bitter calamities; comp. <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-32.htm">Deuteronomy 32:32</a>, "bitter" grapes). And the two could not indeed be harmonized, if it really were thus. So long as a man remains an object of the divine mercy, his sins that have been once forgiven are no more the object of divine judgment. But Job can understand his affliction only as an additional punishment. The conflict of temptation through which he is passing has made God's loving-kindness obscure to him. He appears to himself to be like a prisoner whose feet are forced into the holes of a &#1505;&#1491;, i.e., the block or log of wood in which the feet of a criminal are fastened, and which he must shuffle about with him when he moves; perhaps connected with Arab. sadda, occludere, opplere (foramen), elsewhere &#1502;&#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1499;&#1514; (from the forcible twisting or fastening), Chald. &#1505;&#1491;&#1497;&#1488;, &#1505;&#1491;&#1504;&#1488;, Syr. sado, by which <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/16-24.htm">Acts 16:24</a>, &#x3be;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  equals  &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;, is rendered; Lat. cippus (which Ralbag compares), codex (in Plautus an instrument of punishment for slaves), or also nervus. The verb &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1501; which belongs to it, and is found also in <a href="/job/33-11.htm">Job 33:11</a> in the same connection, is of the jussive form, but is neither jussive nor optative in meaning, as also the future with shortened vowel (e.g., <a href="/job/27-22.htm">Job 27:22</a>; <a href="/job/40-19.htm">Job 40:19</a>) or apocopated (<a href="/job/18-12.htm">Job 18:12</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/23-9.htm">Job 23:9</a>, <a href="/job/23-11.htm">Job 23:11</a>) is used elsewhere from the preference of poetry for a short pregnant form. He seems to himself like a criminal whose steps are closely watched (&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;, as <a href="/job/10-14.htm">Job 10:14</a>), in order that he may not have the undeserved enjoyment of freedom, and may not avoid the execution for which he is reserved by effecting an escape by flight. Instead of &#1488;&#1512;&#1495;&#1514;&#1497;, the reading adopted by Ben-Ascher, Ben-Naphtali writes &#1488;&#1512;&#1495;&#1514;&#1497;, with Cholem in the first syllable; both modes of punctuation change without any fixed law also in other respects in the inflexion of &#1488;&#1512;&#1495;, as of &#1488;&#1512;&#1495;&#1492;, a caravan, the construct is both &#1488;&#1512;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514;, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/6-19.htm">Job 6:19</a>, and &#1488;&#1512;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514;. It is scarcely necessary to remark that the verbs in <a href="/job/13-27.htm">Job 13:27</a> are addressed to God, and are not intended as the third pers. fem. in reference to the stocks (Ralbag). The roots of the feet are undoubtedly their undermost parts, therefore the soles. But what is the meaning of &#1514;&#1468;&#1514;&#1495;&#1511;&#1468;&#1492;? The Vulg., Syr., and Parchon explain: Thou fixest thine attention upon ... , but certainly according to mere conjecture; Ewald, by the help of the Arabic tahhakkaka ala: Thou securest thyself ... , but there is not the least necessity to depart from the ordinary use of the word, as those also do who explain: Thou makest a law or boundary (Aben-Ezra, Ges., Hahn, Schlottm.). The verb &#1495;&#1511;&#1492; is the usual word (certainly cognate and interchangeable with &#1495;&#1511;&#1511;) for carved-out work (intaglio), and perhaps with colour rubbed in, or filled up with metal (vid., <a href="//biblehub.com/job/19-23.htm">Job 19:23</a>, comp. <a href="/ezekiel/23-14.htm">Ezekiel 23:14</a>); it signifies to hew into, to carve, to dig a trench. Stickel is in some measure true to this meaning when he explains: Thou scratchest, pressest (producing blood); by which rendering, however, the Hithpa. is not duly recognised. Raschi is better, tu t'affiches, according to which Mercerus: velut affixus vestigiis pedum meorum adhaeres, ne qu elabi possim aut effugere. But a closer connection with the ordinary use of the word is possible. Accordingly Rosenm., Umbreit, and others render: Thou markest a line round my feet (drawest a circle round); Hirz., however, in the strictest sense of the Hithpa.: Thou diggest thyself in (layest thyself as a circular line about my feet). But the Hithpa. does not necessarily mean se insculpere, but, as &#1492;&#1514;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1496; sibi exuere, &#1492;&#1514;&#1508;&#1514;&#1495; sibi solvere, &#1492;&#1514;&#1495;&#1504;&#1503; sibi propitium facere, it may also mean sibi insculpere, which does not give so strange a representation: Thou makest to thyself furrows (or also: lines) round the soles of my feet, so that they cannot move beyond the narrow boundaries marked out by thee. With &#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/13-28.htm">Job 13:28</a>, a circumstantial clause begins: While he whom Thou thus fastenest in as a criminal, etc. Observe the fine rhythmical accentuation acha&#772;lo &#8219;asch. Since God whom he calls upon does not appear, Job's defiance is changed to timidity. The elegiac tone, into which his bold tone has passed, is continued in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/14.htm">Job 14</a>. </body></html>
