But when man is cut off by death, he is for ever removed from his place in this world. The life of man may fitly be compared to the waters of a land flood, which spread far, but soon dry up. All Job's expressions here show his belief in the great doctrine of the resurrection. Job's friends proving miserable comforters, he pleases himself with the expectation of a change. If our sins are forgiven, and our hearts renewed to holiness, heaven will be the rest of our souls, while our bodies are hidden in the grave from the malice of our enemies, feeling no more pain from our corruptions, or our corrections.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Oh that thou wouldest hide me in the grave; - compare the notes at <a href="/job/3-11.htm">Job 3:11</a> ff. Hebrew "in Sheol" - &#1489;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1500;  b&#305;&#770;-she'o&#770;l. Vulgate, "in inferno." Septuagint &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#837;  en Hade&#772; - "in Hades." On the meaning of the word "Sheol," see the notes at <a href="/isaiah/5-14.htm">Isaiah 5:14</a>. It does not mean here, I think, the grave. It means the region of departed spirits, the place of the dead, where he wished to be, until the tempest of the wrath of God should pass by. He wished to be shut up in some place where the fury of that tempest would not meet him, and where he would be safe. On the meaning of this passage, however, there has been considerable variety of opinion among expositors. Many suppose that the word here properly means "the grave," and that Job was willing to wait there until the wrath of God should be spent, and then that he desired to be brought forth in the general resurrection of the dead.<p>So the Chaldee interprets it of the grave - &#1511;&#1489;&#1493;&#1512;&#1514;&#1488;. There is evidently a desire on the part of Job to be hid in some secret place until the tempest of wrath should sweep by, and until he should be safe. There is an expectation that he would live again at some future period, and a desire to live after the present tokens of the wrath of God should pass by. It is probably a wish for a safe retreat or a hiding-place - where he might be secure, as from a storm. A somewhat similar expression occurs in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/2-19.htm">Isaiah 2:19</a>, where it is said that people would go into holes and caverns until the storm of wrath should pass by, or in order to escape it. But whether Job meant the grave, or the place of departed spirits, cannot be determined, and is not material. In the view of the ancients the one was not remote from the other. The entrance to Sheol was the grave; and either of them would furnish the protection sought. It should be added, that the grave was with the ancients usually a cave, or an excavation from the rock, and such a place might suggest the idea of a hiding-place from the raging storm.<p>That thou wouldest appoint me a set time - When I should be delivered or rescued. Herder renders this, "Appoint me then a new term." The word rendered "a set time" - &#1495;&#1511;  cho&#770;q - means, properly, something decreed, prescribed, appointed and here an appointed time when God would remember or revisit him. It is the expression of his lingering love of life. He had wished to die. He was borne down by heavy trials, and desired a release. He longed even for the grave; compare <a href="//biblehub.com/job/3-20.htm">Job 3:20-22</a>. But there is the instinctive love of life in his bosom, and he asks that God would appoint a time, though ever so remote, in which he would return to him, and permit him to live again. There is the secret hope of some future life - though remote; and he is willing to be hid for any period of time until the wrath of God should pass by, if he might live again. Such is the lingering desire of life in the bosom of man in the severest trials, and the darkest hours; and so instinctively does man look on even to the most remote period with the hope of life. Nature speaks out in the desires of Job; and one of the objects of the poem is to describe the workings of nature with reference to a future state in the severe trials to which he was subjected. We cannot but remark here, what support and consolation would he have found in the clear revelation which we have of the future world, and what a debt of gratitude do we owe to that gospel which has brought life and immortality to light! <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. Job wishes to be kept hidden in the grave until God's wrath against him shall have passed away.

Having pursued the destiny of man through all its steps down to its lowest, its complete extinction in death, Job, with a revulsion created by the instinctive demands of the human spirit, rises to the thought that there might be another life after this one. This thought is expressed in the form of an impassioned desire.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>To understand these verses the Hebrew conception of death must be remembered. Death was not an end of personal existence: the dead person subsisted, he did not live. He descended into Sheol, the abode of deceased persons. His existence was a dreamy shadow of his past life. He had no communion with the living, whether men or God; comp. <a href="/context/job/3-12.htm" title="Why did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should suck?...">Job 3:12-19</a>; <a href="/context/job/10-21.htm" title="Before I go from where I shall not return, even to the land of darkness and the shadow of death;...">Job 10:21-22</a>, <a href="/context/job/14-20.htm" title="You prevail for ever against him, and he passes: you change his countenance, and send him away....">Job 14:20-22</a>. This idea of death is not strictly the teaching of revelation, it is the popular idea from which revelation starts, and revelation on the question rather consists in exhibiting to us how the pious soul struggled with this popular conception and sought to overcome it, and how faith demanded and realized, as faith does, its demand, that the communion with God enjoyed in this life should not be interrupted in death. This was in short a demand and a faith that the state of Sheol should be overleaped, and that the believing soul should be “taken” by God in death to Himself, cf. <a href="/psalms/16-10.htm" title="For you will not leave my soul in hell; neither will you suffer your Holy One to see corruption.">Psalm 16:10</a>; <a href="/psalms/49-15.htm" title="But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave: for he shall receive me. Selah.">Psalm 49:15</a>; <a href="/psalms/73-24.htm" title="You shall guide me with your counsel, and afterward receive me to glory.">Psalm 73:24</a>. This was the solution that generally presented itself to the mind when death was contemplated. The present passage differs in two particulars. It does not exhibit such assured faith as these passages in the Psalms. The problem before the Psalmists was a much simpler one than that before Job. They were men who, when they wrote their words of faith, enjoyed God’s fellowship, and their faith protested against this fellowship being interrupted in death. But Job has lost the sense of God’s fellowship through his afflictions, which are to his mind proof of God’s estrangement from him, hence he has so to speak a double obstacle to overcome, where the Psalmists had only one, and this makes him do no more here than utter a prayer, while the Psalmists expressed a firm assurance. In the following chapters, especially ch. 19, Job also rises to assurance. In another particular this passage differs from these Psalms. It contemplates a different and much more complete solution of the problem. In both the hope of immortality has a purely religious foundation. It springs from the irrepressible longing for communion with God. The Psalmists, in the actual enjoyment of this communion, either protest against death absolutely (Psalms 16), and demand a continuance in life that this fellowship may continue—that is, they rise to the idea of true immortality; or, contemplating death as a fact, they protest against the popular conception of it, and demand that the deceased person shall not sink into Sheol, but pass across its gulf to God. Job’s conception is different from either of these, because his circumstances are different. He does not enjoy the fellowship of God, his afflictions are evidence of the contrary. His firm conviction is that his malady is mortal, in other words, that God’s anger will pursue him to the grave. On this side of death he has no hope of a return to God’s favour. Hence, contemplating that he shall die under God’s anger, his thought is that he might remain in Sheol till God’s wrath be past, for He keepeth not His anger for ever; that God would appoint him a period to remain in death and then remember him with returning mercy and call him back again to His fellowship. But to his mind this involves a complete return to life again of the whole man (<span class="ital"><a href="/job/14-14.htm" title="If a man die, shall he live again? all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come.">Job 14:14</a></span>), for in death there is no fellowship with God (<a href="/psalms/6-5.htm" title="For in death there is no remembrance of you: in the grave who shall give you thanks?">Psalm 6:5</a>). Thus his solution, though it appears to his mind only as a momentary gleam of light, is broader than that of the Psalmists, and corresponds to that made known in subsequent revelation. It is probable that this conception, which the Author of the Poem allows Job to rise to out of the very extremity of his despair, was one not unfamiliar to himself (cf. <a href="/isaiah/24-22.htm" title="And they shall be gathered together, as prisoners are gathered in the pit, and shall be shut up in the prison, and after many days shall they be visited.">Isaiah 24:22</a>). The verses read as a whole:—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>13&emsp;&emsp;Oh that thou wouldst hide me in Sheol,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>&emsp;&emsp;That thou wouldst keep me secret till thy wrath be past,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>&emsp;&emsp;That thou wouldst appoint me a set time and remember me—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>14&emsp;&emsp;If a man die shall he live again?—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>&emsp;&emsp;All the days of my appointed time would I wait<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>&emsp;&emsp;Till my release came;<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>15&emsp;&emsp;Thou wouldst call and I would answer thee,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>&emsp;&emsp;Thou wouldst have a desire to the work of thine hands.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>As Job follows the fascinating thought, the feeling forces itself upon his mind how much is implied in it, nothing less than that a man when dead should live again (<span class="ital"><a href="/job/14-14.htm" title="If a man die, shall he live again? all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come.">Job 14:14</a></span>), but he will not allow himself to be arrested in his pursuit of the glorious vision—he describes how he would wait all the period appointed to him (his “warfare,” cf. ch. <a href="/job/7-1.htm" title="Is there not an appointed time to man on earth? are not his days also like the days of an hireling?">Job 7:1</a>) till his release came, and dwells upon the joy and readiness with which he would answer the voice of his Creator calling him to His fellowship again when He longed after the work of His hands long estranged and hidden from Him (ch. <a href="/job/10-3.htm" title="Is it good to you that you should oppress, that you should despise the work of your hands, and shine on the counsel of the wicked?">Job 10:3</a>).

Job, a true child of his age, has a still sadder conception of the destiny of man in death; and the conflict through which he is passing makes this sad conception still sadder than it otherwise is. The fate of the tree is far from being so hopeless as that of man; for (1) if a tree is hewn down, it (the stump left in the ground) puts forth new shoots (on &#1492;&#1495;&#1500;&#1497;&#1507;, vid., on <a href="/psalms/90-6.htm">Psalm 90:6</a>), and young branches (&#1497;&#1493;&#1504;&#1511;&#1514;, the tender juicy sucker &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;) do not cease. This is a fact, which is used by Isaiah (<a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1-13</a>) as an emblem of a fundamental law in operation in the history of Israel: the terebinth and oak there symbolize Israel; the stump (&#1502;&#1510;&#1489;&#1514;) is the remnant that survives the judgment, and this remnant becomes the seed from which a new sanctified Israel springs up after the old is destroyed. Carey is certainly not wrong when he remarks that Job thinks specially of the palm (the date), which is propagated by such suckers; Shaw's expression corresponds exactly to &#1500;&#1488; &#1514;&#1495;&#1491;&#1500;: "when the old trunk dies, there is never wanting one or other of these offsprings to succeed it." Then (2) if the root of a tree becomes old (&#1495;&#1494;&#1511;&#1497;&#1503; inchoative Hiphil: senescere, Ew. 122, c) in the earth, and its trunk (&#1490;&#1468;&#1494;&#1506; also of the stem of an undecayed tree, <a href="/isaiah/40-24.htm">Isaiah 40:24</a>) dies away in the dust, it can nevertheless regain its vitality which had succumbed to the weakness of old age: revived by the scent (&#1512;&#1497;&#1495; always of scent, which anything exhales, not, perhaps Sol 1:3 only excepted, odor  equals  odoratus) of water, it puts forth buds for both leaves and flowers, and brings forth branches (&#1511;&#1510;&#1497;&#1512;, prop. cuttings, twigs) again, &#1499;&#1502;&#1493; &#1504;&#1496;&#1506;, like a plant, or a young plant (the form of &#1504;&#1496;&#1506; in pause), therefore, as if fresh planted, lxx &#x3c9;&#788;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1; &#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;. One is here at once reminded of the palm which, on the one hand, is pre-eminently a &#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;,<p>(Note: When the English army landed in Egypt in 1801, Sir Sydney Smith gave the troops the sure sign, that wherever date-trees grew there must be water; and this is supported by the fact of people digging after it generally, within a certain range round the tree within which the roots of the tree could obtain moisture from the fluid. - Vid., R. Wilson's History of the Expedition to Egypt, p. 18.)<p>on the other hand possesses a wonderful vitality, whence it is become a figure for youthful vigour. The palm and the phoenix have one name, and not without reason. The tree reviving as from the dead at the scent of water, which Job describes, is like that wondrous bird rising again from its own ashes (vid., on <a href="/job/29-18.htm">Job 29:18</a>). Even when centuries have at last destroyed the palm - says Masius, in his beautiful and thoughtful studies of nature - thousands of inextricable fibres of parasites cling about the stem, and delude the traveller with an appearance of life. </body></html>
