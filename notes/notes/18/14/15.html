But when man is cut off by death, he is for ever removed from his place in this world. The life of man may fitly be compared to the waters of a land flood, which spread far, but soon dry up. All Job's expressions here show his belief in the great doctrine of the resurrection. Job's friends proving miserable comforters, he pleases himself with the expectation of a change. If our sins are forgiven, and our hearts renewed to holiness, heaven will be the rest of our souls, while our bodies are hidden in the grave from the malice of our enemies, feeling no more pain from our corruptions, or our corrections.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee - This is language taken from courts of justice. It refers, probably, not to a future time, but to the present. "Call thou now, and I will respond." It expresses a desire to come at once to trial; to have the matter adjusted before he should leave the world. He could not bear the idea of going out of the world under the imputations which were lying on him, and he asked for an opportunity to vindicate himself before his Maker; compare the notes at <a href="/job/9-16.htm">Job 9:16</a>.<p>Thou wilt have a desire to the work of thine hands - To me, one of thy creatures. This should, with more propriety, be rendered in the imperative, "do thou have a desire." It is the expression of an earnest wish that God would show an interest in him as one of his creatures, and would bring the matter to a speedy issue. The word here rendered, "have a desire" (&#1514;&#1499;&#1505;&#1507;  t&#305;&#770;ka&#770;saph), means literally to be or become "pale" (from &#1499;&#1505;&#1507;  keseph), "silver," so called from its paleness, like the Greek &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  arguros from &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;  agros, white); and then the verb means to pine or long after anything, so as to become pale. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15. namely, at the resurrection (Joh 5:28; Ps 17:15).<p>have a desire to&#8212;literally, "become pale with anxious desire:" the same word is translated "sore longedst after" (Ge 31:30; Ps 84:2), implying the utter unlikelihood that God would leave in oblivion the "creature of His own hands so fearfully and wonderfully made." It is objected that if Job knew of a future retribution, he would make it the leading topic in solving the problem of the permitted afflictions of the righteous. But, (1) He did not intend to exceed the limits of what was clearly revealed; the doctrine was then in a vague form only; (2) The doctrine of God's moral government in this life, even independently of the future, needed vindication.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/job/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> I trust there is a time coming when thou wilt grant me the mercy which now thou deniest me, to wit, a favourable hearing, when thou <span class="ital">wilt call</span> to me to speak for myself, and <span class="ital">I shall answer thee</span>; which I know will be to thy satisfaction and my comfort.

Either at death, when the soul of than is required of him, and he is summoned out of time into eternity, and has sometimes previous notice of it; though not by a prophet, or express messenger from the Lord, as Hezekiah had, yet by some disease and distemper or another, which has a voice, a call in it to expect a remove shortly; and a good man that is prepared for it, he answers to this call readily and cheerfully; death is no king of terrors to him, he is not reluctant to it, yea, desirous of it; entreats his dismission in peace, and even longs for it, and rejoices and triumphs in the views of it: or else at the resurrection, when Christ shall call to the dead, as he did to Lazarus, and say, Come forth; and when they shall hear his voice, even the voice of the archangel, and shall answer to it, and come forth out of their graves, the sea, death, and the grave, being obliged to deliver up the dead that are therein; though some think this refers to God's call unto him in a judicial way, and his answers to it by way of defence, as in <a href="/job/13-22.htm">Job 13:22</a>; but the other sense seems more agreeable to the context: <p>thou wilt have a desire to the work of thine hands; meaning his body, which is the workmanship of God, and a curious piece of workmanship it is, wonderfully and fearfully made, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/139-14.htm">Psalm 139:14</a>, and curiously wrought; and though it may seem to be marred and spoiled by death, yet God will have a desire to the restoration of it at the resurrection to a better condition; even the bodies of his people, and that because they are vessels chosen by him, given to his Son, redeemed by his blood, united to his person, and sanctified by his Spirit, whose temples they are, and in whom he dwells: wherefore upon these considerations it may be reasonably supposed that Father, Son, and Spirit, have a desire to the resurrection of the bodies of the saints, and in which they will have a concern; and from which it may be concluded it will be certainly effected, since God is a rock, and his work is perfect, or will be, both upon the bodies and souls of his people; and the work of sanctification will not be properly completed on them until their vile bodies are changed, and made like to the glorious body of Christ; which must be very desirable to him, who has such a special love for them, and delight in them. Some render the words with an interrogation, "wilt thou desire to destroy the work of thine hands" (e)? surely thou wilt not; or, as Ben Gersom, <p>"is it fit that thou shouldest desire to destroy the work of thine hands?'' <p>surely it is not becoming, it cannot be thought that thou wilt do it; but the former sense is best. <p>(e) "perdere desiderabis?"

There would be sweet colloquy between us; for thou wilt (or, rather, <span class="accented">wouldest</span>) have a desire to the work of thine hands (comp. ch. 10:8-11). Job assumes that God must love whatever he has created, and be drawn towards it by a secret, strong desire. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/14.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>  7  For there is hope for a tree:<p>If it is hewn down, it sprouts again,<p>And its shoot ceaseth not.<p>  8  If its root becometh old in the ground,<p>And its trunk dieth off in the dust:<p>  9  At the scent of water it buddeth,<p>And bringeth forth branches like a young plant.<p>As the tree falleth so it lieth, says a cheerless proverb. Job, a true child of his age, has a still sadder conception of the destiny of man in death; and the conflict through which he is passing makes this sad conception still sadder than it otherwise is. The fate of the tree is far from being so hopeless as that of man; for (1) if a tree is hewn down, it (the stump left in the ground) puts forth new shoots (on &#1492;&#1495;&#1500;&#1497;&#1507;, vid., on <a href="/psalms/90-6.htm">Psalm 90:6</a>), and young branches (&#1497;&#1493;&#1504;&#1511;&#1514;, the tender juicy sucker &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;) do not cease. This is a fact, which is used by Isaiah (<a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1-13</a>) as an emblem of a fundamental law in operation in the history of Israel: the terebinth and oak there symbolize Israel; the stump (&#1502;&#1510;&#1489;&#1514;) is the remnant that survives the judgment, and this remnant becomes the seed from which a new sanctified Israel springs up after the old is destroyed. Carey is certainly not wrong when he remarks that Job thinks specially of the palm (the date), which is propagated by such suckers; Shaw's expression corresponds exactly to &#1500;&#1488; &#1514;&#1495;&#1491;&#1500;: "when the old trunk dies, there is never wanting one or other of these offsprings to succeed it." Then (2) if the root of a tree becomes old (&#1495;&#1494;&#1511;&#1497;&#1503; inchoative Hiphil: senescere, Ew. 122, c) in the earth, and its trunk (&#1490;&#1468;&#1494;&#1506; also of the stem of an undecayed tree, <a href="/isaiah/40-24.htm">Isaiah 40:24</a>) dies away in the dust, it can nevertheless regain its vitality which had succumbed to the weakness of old age: revived by the scent (&#1512;&#1497;&#1495; always of scent, which anything exhales, not, perhaps Sol 1:3 only excepted, odor  equals  odoratus) of water, it puts forth buds for both leaves and flowers, and brings forth branches (&#1511;&#1510;&#1497;&#1512;, prop. cuttings, twigs) again, &#1499;&#1502;&#1493; &#1504;&#1496;&#1506;, like a plant, or a young plant (the form of &#1504;&#1496;&#1506; in pause), therefore, as if fresh planted, lxx &#x3c9;&#788;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1; &#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;. One is here at once reminded of the palm which, on the one hand, is pre-eminently a &#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;,<p>(Note: When the English army landed in Egypt in 1801, Sir Sydney Smith gave the troops the sure sign, that wherever date-trees grew there must be water; and this is supported by the fact of people digging after it generally, within a certain range round the tree within which the roots of the tree could obtain moisture from the fluid. - Vid., R. Wilson's History of the Expedition to Egypt, p. 18.)<p>on the other hand possesses a wonderful vitality, whence it is become a figure for youthful vigour. The palm and the phoenix have one name, and not without reason. The tree reviving as from the dead at the scent of water, which Job describes, is like that wondrous bird rising again from its own ashes (vid., on <a href="/job/29-18.htm">Job 29:18</a>). Even when centuries have at last destroyed the palm - says Masius, in his beautiful and thoughtful studies of nature - thousands of inextricable fibres of parasites cling about the stem, and delude the traveller with an appearance of life. </body></html>
