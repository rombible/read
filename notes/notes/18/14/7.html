But when man is cut off by death, he is for ever removed from his place in this world. The life of man may fitly be compared to the waters of a land flood, which spread far, but soon dry up. All Job's expressions here show his belief in the great doctrine of the resurrection. Job's friends proving miserable comforters, he pleases himself with the expectation of a change. If our sins are forgiven, and our hearts renewed to holiness, heaven will be the rest of our souls, while our bodies are hidden in the grave from the malice of our enemies, feeling no more pain from our corruptions, or our corrections.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For there is hope of a tree - This passage to <a href="//biblehub.com/job/14-12.htm">Job 14:12</a>, is one of exquisite beauty. Its object is to state reasons why man should be permitted to enjoy this life. A tree, if cut down, might spring up again and flourish; but not man. He died to rise no more; he is cut down and lives not again. The passage is important as expressing the prevalent sentiment of the time in which <a href="//biblehub.com/job/54.htm">Job 54</a>ed about the future condition of man, and is one that deserves a close examination. The great question is, whether Job believed in the future state, or in the resurrection of the dead? On this question one or two things are clear at the outset.<p>(1) He did not believe that man would spring up from the grave in any sense similar to the mode in which the sprout or germ of a tree grows up when the tree is cut down.<p>(2) He did not believe in the doctrine of metempsychosis, or transmigration of souls; a doctrine that was so common among the ancients.<p>In this respect the patriarchal religion stood aloof from the systems of paganism, and there is not to be found, that I know of, any expression that would lead us to suppose that they had ever embraced it, or had even heard of it. The general sentiment here is, that if a tree is cut down, it may be expected to shoot up again, and another tree will be found in its place - as is the case with the chestnut, the willow, the oak. But Job says that there was nothing like this to happen to man. There was no root, no germ, no seminal principle from which he would be made to live again on the earth. He was to be finally cut off, from all his pleasures and his friends here, and to go away to return no more. Still, that Job believed in his continued existence beyond the grave - his existence in the dark and gloomy world of shades, is apparent from the whole book, and indeed from the very passage before us; see <a href="/job/14-13.htm">Job 14:13</a> - compare <a href="//biblehub.com/job/10-21.htm">Job 10:21-22</a>. The image here is one that is very beautiful, and one that is often employed by poets. Thus, Moschus, in his third Idyl, as translated by Gisborne:<p>The meanest herb we trample in the field,<p>Or in the garden nurture, when its leaf<p>At winter's touch is blasted, and its place<p>Forgotten, soon its vernal bud renews,<p>And from short slumber wakes to life again.<p>Man wakes no more! Man, valiant, glorious, wise,<p>When death once chills him, sinks in sleep profound.<p>A long, unconscious, never-ending sleep.<p>See also Beattie's Hermit:<p>'Tis night, and the landscape is lovely no more;<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. Man may the more claim a peaceful life, since, when separated from it by death, he never returns to it. This does not deny a future life, but a return to the present condition of life. Job plainly hopes for a future state (Job 14:13; Job 7:2). Still, it is but vague and trembling hope, not assurance; excepting the one bright glimpse in Job 19:25. The Gospel revelation was needed to change fears, hopes, and glimpses into clear and definite certainties.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/job/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> But man, though a far nobler creature, is in a much worse condition, and when once he loseth this present and worldly life, he never recovers it; therefore show some pity to him, and give him some comfort whilst he lives. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/job/14.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout again,....

Sir. 10:18) belongs to the subject as an adjectival clause: woman-born man, short-lived, and full of unrest, opens out as a flower. Woman is weak, with pain she brings forth children; she is impure during her lying-in, therefore weakness, suffering, and impurity is the portion of man even from the birth (<a href="/job/15-14.htm">Job 15:14</a>; <a href="/job/25-4.htm">Job 25:4</a>). As &#1511;&#1510;&#1512; is the constr. of &#1511;&#1510;&#1512;, so (&#1512;&#1490;&#1494;) &#1513;&#1474;&#1489;&#1506; is from &#1513;&#1474;&#1489;&#1506;, which here, as <a href="//biblehub.com/job/10-15.htm">Job 10:15</a>, has the strong signification: endowed (with adversity). It is questionable whether &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/14-2.htm">Job 14:2</a>, signifies et marcescit or et succiditur. We have decided here as elsewhere (vid., on <a href="/psalms/37-2.htm">Psalm 37:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/90-6.htm">Psalm 90:6</a>, Genesis, S. 383) in favour of the latter meaning, and as the Targ. (&#1488;&#1514;&#1502;&#1493;&#1500;&#1500;), translated "he is mown down." For this meaning (prop. to cut off from above or before, to lop off), - in which the verb &#1502;&#1500;&#1500; (&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500; &#1504;&#1502;&#1500;) is become technical for the &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#769;, - is most probably favoured by its application in <a href="/job/24-24.htm">Job 24:24</a>; where Jerome however translates, sicut summitates spicarum conterentur, since he derives &#1497;&#1502;&#1500;&#1493; from &#1502;&#1500;&#1500; in the signification not found in the Bible (unless perhaps retained in &#1502;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492; ni , <a href="/deuteronomy/23-25.htm">Deuteronomy 23:25</a>), fricare (Arab. mll, frigere, to parch). At the same time, the signification marcescere, which certainly cannot be combined with praecidere, but may be with fricare (conterere), is not unnatural; it is more appropriate to a flower (comp. &#1504;&#1489;&#1500; &#1510;&#1497;&#1509;, <a href="/isaiah/40-7.htm">Isaiah 40:7</a>); it accords with the parallelism <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/37-2.htm">Psalm 37:2</a>, and must be considered etymologically possible in comparison with &#1511;&#1470;&#1502;&#1500; &#1488;&#1470;&#1502;&#1500;. But it is not supported by any dialect, and none of the old translations furnish any certain evidence in its favour; &#1497;&#1502;&#1493;&#1500;&#1500;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/90-6.htm">Psalm 90:6</a>, which is to be understood impersonally rather than intransitively, does not favour it; and none of the passages in which &#1497;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500; occurs demand it: least of all <a href="//biblehub.com/job/24-24.htm">Job 24:24</a>, where praeciduntur is more suitable than, and <a href="//biblehub.com/job/18-16.htm">Job 18:16</a>, praeciditur, quite as suitable as, marcescit. For these reasons we also take &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500; here, not as fut. Kal from &#1502;&#1500;&#1500;, or, as Hahn, from &#1504;&#1502;&#1500;  equals  &#1504;&#1489;&#1500;, to wither, but as fut. Niph. from &#1502;&#1500;&#1500;, to cut down. At the same time, we do not deny the possibility of the notion of withering having been connected with &#1497;&#1502;&#1500;, whether it be that it belonged originally and independently to the root &#1502;&#1500;, or has branched off from some other radical notion, as "to fall in pieces" (lxx here &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;, and similarly also <a href="/job/18-16.htm">Job 18:16</a>; <a href="/job/24-24.htm">Job 24:24</a>; comp. &#1502;&#1500;&#1495;&#1497;&#1501;, rags, &#1504;&#1502;&#1500;&#1495;, to come to pieces, to be dissolved) or "to become soft" (with which the significations in the dialects, to grind and to parch, may be connected). As a flower, which having opened out is soon cut or withered, is man: &#1488;&#1507;, accedit quod, insuper. This particle, related to &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#768;, adds an enhancing cumulat. More than this, God keeps His eye open (not: His eyes, for the correct reading, expressly noted by the Masora, is &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1498; without Jod plur.), &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1494;&#1492;, super hoc s. tali, over this poor child of man, who is a perishable flower, and not a "walking light, but a fleeting shadow" (Gregory the Great), to watch for and punish his sins, and brings Job to judgment before himself, His tribunal which puts down every justification. Elsewhere the word is pointed &#1489;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1496;, <a href="/job/9-32.htm">Job 9:32</a>; <a href="/job/22-4.htm">Job 22:4</a>; here it is &#1489;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1496;, because the idea is rendered determinate by the addition of &#1506;&#1502;&#1498;. </body></html>
