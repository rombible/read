This whole paragraph is interpreted in a somewhat different way by a late writer. “After a tree is cut down, we see, nevertheless, the old stock flourish again, and send forth new branches; and shall man then, when he once expires, he extinct for ever? Is there no hope that he shall revive, and be raised again hereafter? Yes, there is, according to the doctrine delivered to us by our ancestors: but then they inform us, at the same time, that this resurrection shall not be but with the dissolution and renovation of the world, <a href="/context/job/14-11.htm" title="As the waters fail from the sea, and the flood decays and dries up:...">Job 14:11-12</a>. <span class="ital">The waters go off from the sea, and the flood </span>(the river) <span class="ital">will decay and dry up. And man lieth down and riseth not till the heavens be no more; </span>(till then) <span class="ital">they shall not awake nor be raised out of their sleep.” </span>The meaning seems to be, that as we see every thing in flux, and subject to change, so the whole shall one day be changed. The sea itself will at length be quite absorbed; and the running rivers, which now flow perpetually, as if supplied by everlasting springs, will nevertheless, in time, quite cease and disappear. This visible frame of things shall be dissolved, and the present heavens themselves shall be no more: and then, and not before, comes the resurrection and general judgment.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/job/14.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>14:7-15 Though a tree is cut down, yet, in a moist situation, shoots come forth, and grow up as a newly planted tree. But when man is cut off by death, he is for ever removed from his place in this world. The life of man may fitly be compared to the waters of a land flood, which spread far, but soon dry up. All Job's expressions here show his belief in the great doctrine of the resurrection. Job's friends proving miserable comforters, he pleases himself with the expectation of a change. If our sins are forgiven, and our hearts renewed to holiness, heaven will be the rest of our souls, while our bodies are hidden in the grave from the malice of our enemies, feeling no more pain from our corruptions, or our corrections.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>So man lieth down, and riseth not - He lies down in the grave and does not rise again on the earth.<p>Till the heavens be no more - That is, never; for such is the fair interpretation of the passage, and this accords with its design. Job means to say, undoubtedly, that man would never appear again in the land of the living; that he would not spring up from the grave, as a sprout does from a fallen tree; and that when he dies, he goes away from the earth never to return. Whether he believed in a future state, or in the future resurrection, is another question, and one that cannot be determined from this passage. His complaint is, that the present life is short, and that man when he has once passed through it cannot return to enjoy it again, if it has been unhappy; and he asks, therefore, why, since it was so short, man might not be permitted to enjoy it without molestation. It does not follow from this passage that he believed that the heavens ever would be no more, or would pass away.<p>The heavens are the most permanent and enduring objects of which we have any knowledge, and are, therefore, used to denote permanency and eternity; see <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/89-36.htm">Psalm 89:36-37</a>. This verse, therefore, is simply a solemn declaration of the belief of Job that when man dies, he dies to live no more on the earth. Of the truth of this, no one can doubt - and the truth is as important and affecting as it is undoubted. If man could come back again, life would be a different thing. If he could revisit the earth to repair the evils of a wicked life, to repent of his errors, to make amends for his faults, and to make preparation for a future world, it would be a different thing to live, and a different thing to die. But when he travels over the road of life, he treads a path which is not to be traversed again. When he neglects an opportunity to do good, it cannot be recalled. When he commits an offence, he cannot come back to repair the evil. He falls, and dies, and lives no more. He enters on other scenes, and is amidst the retributions of another state. How important then to secure the passing moment, and to be prepared to go hence, to return no more! The idea here presented is one that is common with the poets. Thus, Horace says:<p>Nobis, cum semel occidit brevis lux,<p>Nox est perpetua una dormienda. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. heavens be no more&#8212;This only implies that Job had no hope of living again in the present order of the world, not that he had no hope of life again in a new order of things. Ps 102:26 proves that early under the Old Testament the dissolution of the present earth and heavens was expected (compare Ge 8:22). Enoch before Job had implied that the "saints shall live again" (Jude 14; Heb 11:13-16). Even if, by this phrase, Job meant "never" (Ps 89:29) in his gloomier state of feelings, yet the Holy Ghost has made him unconsciously (1Pe 1:11, 12) use language expressing the truth, that the resurrection is to be preceded by the dissolution of the heavens. In Job 14:13-15 he plainly passes to brighter hopes of a world to come.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/job/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Man lieth down, </span> to wit, in his bed, the grave, or to sleep the sleep of death, as this phrase is used, <span class="bld"><a href="/genesis/46-30.htm" title="And Israel said to Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen your face, because you are yet alive.">Genesis 46:30</a> <a href="/deuteronomy/31-6.htm" title="Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of them: for the LORD your God, he it is that does go with you; he will not fail you, nor forsake you.">Deu 31:6</a> <a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm" title="And when your days be fulfilled, and you shall sleep with your fathers, I will set up your seed after you, which shall proceed out of your bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.">2 Samuel 7:12</a> <a href="/1_kings/1-21.htm" title="Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders.">1 Kings 1:21</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Riseth not, </span> to wit, to tills life; for he speaks not here of the life to come, nor of the resurrection of the belly after death by the Divine power; of his belief whereof he giveth sufficient evidences in divers places. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Till the heavens be no more, </span> i.e. either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

This is not an absolute denial of a <span class="accented">final</span> resurrection, since Job is speaking of the world as it lies before him, not of eventualities. Just as he sees the land encroach upon the sea, and remain land, and the river-courses, once dried up, remain dry, so he sees men descend into the grave and remain there, without rising up again. This is the established order of nature as it exists before his eyes. <span class="cmt_word">Till the heavens be no more, they shall not awake</span>. This order of things, Job believes, rightly enough, will continue as long as the heavens and the earth endure. What will happen afterwards he does not so much as inquire.

Like the friends, he acknowledges an hereditary proneness to sin; but this proneness to sin affords him no satisfactory explanation of so unmerciful a visitation of punishment as his seems to him to be. It appears to him that man must the rather be an object of divine forbearance and compassion, since absolute purity is impossible to him. If, as is really the case, man's days are &#1495;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501;, cut off, i.e., &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;, determined (distinct from &#1495;&#1512;&#1493;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501; with an unchangeable Kametz: sharp, i.e., quick, eager, diligent), - if the number of his months is with God, i.e., known by God, because fixed beforehand by Him, - if He has set fixed bounds (Keri &#1495;&#1511;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493;) for him, and he cannot go beyond them, may God then look away from him, i.e., turn from him His strict watch (&#1502;&#1503; &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1492;, as <a href="/job/7-19.htm">Job 7:19</a>; &#1502;&#1503; &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514;, <a href="/job/10-20.htm">Job 10:20</a>), that he may have rest (&#1497;&#1495;&#1491;&#1468;&#1500;, cesset), so that he may at least as a hireling enjoy his day. Thus &#1497;&#1512;&#1510;&#1492; is interpreted by all modern expositors, and most of them consider the object or reason of his rejoicing to be the rest of evening when his work is done, and thereby miss the meaning.<p>Hahn appropriately says, "He desires that God would grant man the comparative rest of the hireling, who must toil in sorrow and eat his bread in the sweat of his brow, but still is free from any special suffering, by not laying extraordinary affliction on him in addition to the common infirmities beneath which he sighs. Since the context treats of freedom from special suffering in life, not of the hope of being set free from it, comp. <a href="//biblehub.com/job/13-25.htm">Job 13:25-27</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/14-3.htm">Job 14:3</a>, the explanation of Umbreit, Ew., Hirz., and others, is to be entirely rejected, viz., that God would at least permit man the rest of a hireling, who, though he be vexed with heavy toil, cheerfully reconciles himself to it in prospect of the reward he hopes to obtain at evening time. Job does not claim for man the toil which the hireling gladly undergoes in expectation of complete rest, but the toil of the hireling, which seems to him to be rest in comparison with the possibility of having still greater toil to undergo." Such is the true connection.<p>(Note: In honour of our departed friend, whose Commentary on Job abounds in observations manifesting a delicate appreciation of the writer's purpose and thought, we have quoted his own words.)<p>Man's life - this life which is as a hand-breadth (<a href="/psalms/39-6.htm">Psalm 39:6</a>), and in <a href="/job/7-1.htm">Job 7:1</a>. is compared to a hireling's day, which is sorrowful enough - is not to be overburdened with still more and extraordinary suffering.<p>It must be asked, however, whether &#1512;&#1497;&#1492; seq. acc. here signifies &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd; (&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, lxx), or not rather persolvere; for it is undeniable that it has this meaning in <a href="/leviticus/26-34.htm">Leviticus 26:34</a> (vid., however Keil [Pent., en loc.]) and elsewhere (prop. to satisfy, remove, discharge what is due). The Hiphil is used in this sense in post-biblical Hebrew, and most Jewish expositors explain &#1497;&#1512;&#1510;&#1492; by &#1497;&#1513;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;. If it signifies to enjoy, &#1506;&#1491; ought to be interpreted: that (he at least may, like as a hireling, enjoy his day). But this signification of &#1506;&#1491; (ut in the final sense) is strange, and the signification dum (<a href="/job/1-18.htm">Job 1:18</a>; <a href="/job/8-21.htm">Job 8:21</a>) or adeo ut (<a href="/isaiah/47-7.htm">Isaiah 47:7</a>) is not, however, suitable, if &#1497;&#1512;&#1510;&#1492; is to be explained in the sense of persolvere, and therefore translate donec persolvat (persolverit). We have translated "until he accomplish," and wish "accomplish" to be understood in the sense of "making complete," as <a href="//biblehub.com/colossians/1-24.htm">Colossians 1:24</a>, Luther ("vollzhlig machen")  equals  &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd;. </body></html>
