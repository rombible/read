What reason we have to bless God, that we are not making such complaints! Even good men, when in great troubles, have much ado not to entertain hard thoughts of God. Eliphaz had represented Job as unhumbled under his affliction: No, says Job, I know better things; the dust is now the fittest place for me. In this he reminds us of Christ, who was a man of sorrows, and pronounced those blessed that mourn, for they shall be comforted.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And thou hast filled me with wrinkles - Noyes renders this, "and thou hast seized hold of me, which is a witness against me." Wemyss, "since thou hast bound me with chains, witnesses come forward." Good, "and hast cut off myself from becoming a witness." Luther, "he has made me "kuntzlich" (skillfully, artificially, cunningly,) and bears witness against me." Jerome, "my wrinkles bear witness against me." Septuagint, "my lie has become a witness, and is risen up against me." From this variety of explanations, it will be seen that this passage is not of easy and obvious construction. The Hebrew word which is here used and rendered, "thou hast filled me with wrinkles" (&#1514;&#1511;&#1502;&#1496;&#1504;&#1497;  t&#305;&#770;qa&#770;mat&#803;e&#772;n&#305;&#770;y), from &#1511;&#1502;&#1496;  qa&#770;mat&#803; - occurs only in one other place in the Bible; <a href="/job/22-16.htm">Job 22:16</a>. It is there in the "Pual" form, and rendered "were cut down." According to Gesenius, it means, to lay fast hold of, to seize with the hands, and answers to the Arabic "to bind."<p>The word in Chaldee (&#1511;&#1502;&#1496;  qa&#770;mat&#803;) means to wrinkle, or collect in wrinkles; and is applied to anything that is "contracted," or rough. It is applied in the form &#1511;&#1497;&#1502;&#1496;  qa&#770;ymat&#803; to the pupil of the eye as being "contracted," as in the declaration in Derek 'Erets, c. 5, quoted by Castell. "The world is like the eye; where the ocean that surrounds the world is white; the world itself is black; the pupil is Jerusalem, and the image in the pupil is the sanctuary." Probably the true notion of the word is to be found in the Arabic. According to Castell, this means, to tie together the four feet of a sheep or lamb, in order that it might be slain; to bind an infant in swaddling clothes before it is laid in a cradle; to collect camels into a group or herd; and hence, the noun is used to denote a cord or rope twisted of wool, or of leaves of the palm, or the bandages by which an infant is bound. This idea is not in use in the Hebrew; but I have no doubt that this was the original sense of the word, and that this is one of the numerous places in Job where light may be cast upon the meaning of a word from its use in Arabic. The Hebrew word may be applied to the "collecting" or "contraction" of the face in wrinkles by age, but this is not the sense here. We should express the idea by "being "drawn up" with pain or affliction; by being straitened, or compressed." The meaning - is that of "drawing together" - as the feet of a sheep when tied, or twisting - as a rope; and the idea here is, that Job was drawn up, compressed, bound by his afflictions - and that this was a witness against him. The word "compressed" comes as near to the sense as any one that we have.<p>Which is a witness against me - That is, "this is an argument against my innocence. The fact that God has thus compressed, and fettered, and fastened me; that he has bound me as with a cord - as if I were tied for the slaughter, is an argument on which my friends insist, and to which they appeal, as a proof of my guilt. I cannot answer it. They refer to it constantly. It is the burden of their demonstration, and how can I reply to it?" The position of mind here is, that he could appeal to God for his uprightness, but these afflictions stood in the way of his argument for his innocence with his friends. They were the "usual" proofs of God's displeasure, and he could not well meet the argument which was drawn from them in his case, for in all his protestations of innocence there stood these afflictions - the usual proofs of God's displeasure against people - as evidence against him, to which they truimphantly appealed.<p>And my leanness rising up in me - Dr. Good renders this, "my calumniator." Wemyss, "false witnesses." So Jerome, "falsiloquus." The Septuagint renders it," my lie - &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;  to pseudos mou - rises up against me." The Hebrew word (&#1499;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;  kachash) means properly "a lie, deceit, hypocrisy." But it cannot be supposed that Job would formally admit that he was a liar and a hypocrite. This would have been to concede the whole point in dispute. The word, therefore, it would seem, "must" have some other sense. The verb &#1499;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;  ka&#770;chash is used to denote not only to "lie," but also to "waste away, to fail." <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/109-24.htm">Psalm 109:24</a>, "my flesh "faileth" of fatness." The idea seems to have been, that a person whose flesh had wasted away by sickness, as it were, "belied himself;" or it was a "false testimony" about himself; it did not give "a fair representation" of him. That could be obtained only when he was in sound health. Thus, in <a href="//biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-17.htm">Habakkuk 3:17</a>, "the labour of the olive "shall fail."" Hebrew shall "lie" or "deceive;" that is, it shall belie itself, or shall not do justice to itself; it shall afford no fair representation of what the olive is fitted to produce. So the word is used <a href="/hosea/9-2.htm">Hosea 9:2</a>. It is used here in this sense, as denoting "the false appearance of Job" - his present aspect - which was no proper representation of himself; that is, his emaciated and ulcerated form. This, he says, was a "witness" against him. It was one of the proofs to which they appealed, and he did not know how to answer it. It was usually an evidence of divine displeasure, and he now solemnly and tenderly addresses God, and says, that he had furnished this testimony against him - and he was overwhelmed. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. filled &#8230; with wrinkles&#8212;Rather (as also the same Hebrew word in Job 22:16; English Version, "cut down"), "thou hast fettered me, thy witness" (besides cutting off my "band of witnesses," Job 16:7), that is, hast disabled me by pains from properly attesting my innocence. But another "witness" arises against him, namely, his "leanness" or wretched state of body, construed by his friends into a proof of his guilt. The radical meaning of the Hebrew is "to draw together," whence flow the double meaning "to bind" or "fetter," and in Syriac, "to wrinkle."<p>leanness&#8212;meaning also "lie"; implying it was a "false witness."<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/job/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Thou hast filled me with wrinkles, </span> by consuming all my fat and flesh. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Which is a witness against me; </span> Heb. which is a witness of the reality, and greatness, and just cause of my sorrows.

It is, however, primarily an accusation; it wounds instead of soothing. Of this kind of speech, says Job, one has now heard &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, much, i.e., (in a pregnant sense) amply sufficient, although the word might signify elliptically (<a href="/psalms/106-43.htm">Psalm 106:43</a>; comp. <a href="/nehemiah/9-28.htm">Nehemiah 9:28</a>) many times (Jer. frequenter); multa (as <a href="/job/23-14.htm">Job 23:14</a>) is, however, equally suitable, and therefore is to be preferred as the more natural. <a href="/job/16-2.htm">Job 16:2</a> shows how &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; is intended; they are altogether &#1506;&#1502;&#1500; &#1502;&#1504;&#1495;&#1502;&#1497;, consolatores onerosi (Jer.), such as, instead of alleviating, only cause &#1506;&#1502;&#1500;, molestiam (comp. on <a href="/job/13-4.htm">Job 13:4</a>). In <a href="/job/16-3.htm">Job 16:3</a> Job returns their reproach of being windy, i.e., one without any purpose and substance, which they brought against him, <a href="/job/15-2.htm">Job 15:2</a>.: have windy words an end, or (&#1500;&#1493; vel   equals  &#1488;&#1501; in a disjunctive question, Ges. 155, 2, b) if not, what goads thee on to reply? &#1502;&#1512;&#1509; has been already discussed on <a href="/job/6-25.htm">Job 6:25</a>. The Targ. takes it in the sense of &#1502;&#1500;&#1509;: what makes it sweet to thee, etc.; the Jewish interpreters give it, without any proof, the signification, to be strong; the lxx transl. &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;, which is not transparent. Hirz., Ew., Schlottm., and others, call in the help of the Arabic marida (Aramaic &#1502;&#1512;&#1506;), to be sick, the IV. form of which signifies "to make sick," not "to injure." <p>(Note: The primary meaning of Arabic marida (root mr, stringere) is maceratum esse, by pressing, rubbing, beating, to be tender, enervated (Germ. dialectic and popul. abmaracht); comp. the nearest related maratsa, then maraza, marasa, maraa, and further, the development of the meaning of morbus and &#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;; - originally and first, of bodily sickness, then also of diseased affections and conditions of spirit, as envy, hatred, malice, etc.; vid., Sur. 2, v. 9, and Beidhwi thereon. - Fl.)<p>We keep to the primary meaning, to pierce, penetrate; Hiph. to goad, bring out, lacessere: what incites thee, that (&#1499;&#1497; as <a href="//biblehub.com/job/6-11.htm">Job 6:11</a>, quod not quum) thou repliest again? The collective thought of what follows is not that he also, if they were in his place, could do as they have done; that he, however, would not so act (thus e.g., Blumenfeld: with reasons for comfort I would overwhelm you, and sympathizingly shake my head over you, etc.). This rendering is destroyed by the shaking of the head, which is never a gesture of pure compassion, but always of malignant joy, Sir. 12:18; or of mockery at another's fall, <a href="/isaiah/37-22.htm">Isaiah 37:22</a>; and misfortune, <a href="/psalms/22-8.htm">Psalm 22:8</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/18-16.htm">Jeremiah 18:16</a>; <a href="/matthew/27-39.htm">Matthew 27:39</a>. Hence Merc. considers the antithesis to begin with <a href="//biblehub.com/job/16-5.htm">Job 16:5</a>, where, however, there is nothing to indicate it: minime id facerem, quin potius vos confirmarem ore meo - rather: that he also could display the same miserable consolation; he represents to them a change of their respective positions, in order that, as in a mirror, they may recognise the hatefulness of their conduct. The negative antecedent clause si essem (with &#1500;&#1493;&#1468;, according to Ges. 155, 2, f) is surrounded by cohortatives, which (since the interrogative form of interpretation is inadmissible) signify not only loquerer, but loqui possem, or rather loqui vellem (comp. e.g., <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/51-18.htm">Psalm 51:18</a>, dare vellem). When he says: I would range together, etc. (Carey: I would combine), he gives them to understand that their speeches are more artificial than natural, more declamations than the outgushings of the heart; instead of &#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, it is &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, since the object of the action is thought is as the means, as in <a href="/job/16-4.htm">Job 16:4</a> &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; &#1489;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;, capite meo (for caput meum, <a href="/psalms/22-8.htm">Psalm 22:8</a>), and &#1489;&#1468;&#1508;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/16-10.htm">Job 16:10</a>, for &#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;&#1501;, comp. <a href="/jeremiah/18-16.htm">Jeremiah 18:16</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/1-17.htm">Lamentations 1:17</a>, Ges. 138&#8224; ; Ew. takes &#1495;&#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1512; by comparison of the Arabic chbr, to know (the IV. form of which, achbara, however, signifies to cause to know, announce), in a sense that belongs neither to the Heb. nor to the Arab.: to affect wisdom. In <a href="/job/16-5.htm">Job 16:5</a> the chief stress is upon "with my mouth," without the heart being there, so also on the word "my lips," solace (&#1504;&#1497;&#1491; &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;., recalling <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/57-19.htm">Isaiah 57:19</a>, &#1504;&#1497;&#1489; &#1513;&#1474;&#1508;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501;, offspring or fruit of the lips) of my lips, i.e., dwelling only on the lips, and not coming from the heart. In ''&#1488;&#1488;&#1502;&#1468;&#1510;&#1499;&#1501; (Piel, not Hiph.) the Ssere is shortened to Chirek (Ges. 60, rem. 4). According to <a href="//biblehub.com/job/16-6.htm">Job 16:6</a>, &#1499;&#1488;&#1489;&#1499;&#1501; is to be supplied to &#1497;&#1495;&#1513;&#1474;&#1498;. He also could offer such superficial condolence without the sympathy which places itself in the condition and mood of the sufferer, and desires to afford that relief which it cannot. And yet how urgently did he need right and effectual consolation! He is not able to console himself, as the next strophe says: neither by words nor by silence is his pain assuaged. </body></html>
