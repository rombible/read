What reason we have to bless God, that we are not making such complaints! Even good men, when in great troubles, have much ado not to entertain hard thoughts of God. Eliphaz had represented Job as unhumbled under his affliction: No, says Job, I know better things; the dust is now the fittest place for me. In this he reminds us of Christ, who was a man of sorrows, and pronounced those blessed that mourn, for they shall be comforted.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>My face is foul with weeping - Wemyss, "swelled."

The Hebrew word (&#1495;&#1502;&#1512;  cha&#770;mar) means to boil up, to ferment, to foam. Hence, it means to be red, and the word is often used in this sense in Arabic - from the idea of becoming heated or inflamed. Here it probably means either to be "swelled," as any thing does that "ferments," or to be "red" as if "heated" - the usual effect of weeping. The idea of being "defiled" is not in the word.<p>And on my eyelid; is the shadow of death - On the meaning of the word rendered "shadow of death," see the notes at <a href="/job/3-5.htm">Job 3:5</a>. The meaning is, that darkness covered his eyes, and he felt that he was about to die. One of the usual indications of the approach of death is, that the sight fails, and everything seems to be dark. Hence, Homer so often describes death by the phrase, "and darkness covered his eyes;" or the form "a cloud of death covered his eyes" - &#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c8;&#x3b7;  thanatou nephos osse ekalupse&#772;.

Job here refers to Zophar's implied charge (Job 11:14). Nearly the same words occur as to Jesus Christ (Isa 53:9). So Job 16:10 above answers to the description of Jesus Christ (Ps 22:13; Isa 50:6, and Job 16:4 to Ps 22:7). He alone realized what Job aspired after, namely, outward righteousness of acts and inward purity of devotion.

The perfects here also have not a present signification; he depicts his suffering according to the change it has wrought since it came upon him.
