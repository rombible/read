Here Job speaks of the instruments which God suffered to use him ill; and he has respect to his friends who came with open mouth against him, loading him with calumnies and reproaches, laying charges to him he was not conscious of, and treating him with scorn and contempt, which such a gesture is sometimes a token of, <a href="/lamentations/3-46.htm">Lamentations 3:46</a>; and in which manner also Christ was used by men, on whom the reproach of them that reproached God and his people fell, and who exhibited false charges against him of various sorts; and he was the reproach of men and the contempt of the people, who laughed him to scorn, opened their mouths in derision; they shot out the lip and shook the head, and mocked and scoffed at him; yea, "they gaped upon him with their mouth as a ravening and a roaring lion", <a href="/psalms/22-6.htm">Psalm 22:6</a>; to which the allusion is here, when they cried out themselves and called upon others to join them, saying, "Crucify him, crucify him", <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/23-21.htm">Luke 23:21</a>, <p>they have smitten me on the cheek reproachfully; to be smitten on the cheek is a reproach itself, and is a suffering not very patiently endured. Hence Christ, to teach his followers patience, advised when they were smitten on the one cheek to turn the other, that is, to take the blow patiently; and it is not the smart of the stroke that is so much regarded as the shame of it, the affront given, and the indignity offered; see <a href="/2_corinthians/11-20.htm">2 Corinthians 11:20</a>; so that the phrase may be taken for reproaching him; and indeed it may be rendered, "they have smitten on the cheek with reproach" (a); they reproached him, which was the same as if they had smitten him on the cheek; they smote him with their tongues, as Jeremiah's enemies smote him, <a href="/jeremiah/18-18.htm">Jeremiah 18:18</a>; they threw the dirt of scandal and calumny at him, and which is the common lot of God's people; and though since they are reproached for Christ's sake, for the Gospel's sake, and for righteousness sake, they should not be disturbed at that; but rather reckon themselves happy, as they are said to be, and bind these reproaches about their necks as chains of gold, and esteem them greater riches than all the treasures of Egypt. This was literally true of Job's antitype, the Messiah, for as it was foretold of him that he should give his cheek to those that plucked off the hair, and they should smite the Judge of Israel with a rod upon his cheek, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/50-6.htm">Isaiah 50:6</a>, so this was done unto him by the servants of the high priest in his hall, and by others, <a href="/matthew/26-67.htm">Matthew 26:67</a>; <p>they have gathered themselves together against me; Job's friends got together in order to visit him and comfort him, but it proved otherwise, and he viewed it in no other light than as a combination against him: the words may be rendered, "they filled themselves against me" (b); their hearts with wrath and anger, as the Targum; their mouths with reproaches and calumnies, and their eyes with pleasure and delight, and satisfaction at his miseries and afflictions; and so the Vulgate Latin version, <p>"they are satiated with my punishments;'' <p>though rather this may respect the high spirits they were in, the boldness and even impudence, as Job interpreted it, they showed in their conduct towards him, their hearts being swelled with pride and haughtiness and passion (c); see <a href="/esther/7-5.htm">Esther 7:5</a>; or else their numbers that came against him; so Mr. Broughton renders the words, "they came by full troops upon me"; Job's three friends, being great personages, very probably brought a large retinue and train of servants with them; who, observing their master's conduct, behaved in an indecent manner towards him themselves, to whom he may have respect, <a href="/job/30-1.htm">Job 30:1</a>; this was verified in Christ his antitype, whom Judas, with a multitude of men, with swords and staves, even with a band of soldiers, came to apprehend in the garden; and when Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and people of Israel, were gathered against him to do what God had determined should be done, <a href="/matthew/26-46.htm">Matthew 26:46</a>. <p>(a) "cum opprobrio", Beza, Vatablus, Drusius; so Schmidt, Michaelis, Schultens; "with reproaches", Broughton.

The "man of sorrows" of the Old Testament is, in many respects, a type of the "Man of sorrows" of the New; and, in the Messianic psalms, David constantly applies to Christ expressions which Job had used in reference to himself (see <a href="/psalms/22-13.htm">Psalm 22:13</a>).

It is, however, primarily an accusation; it wounds instead of soothing. Of this kind of speech, says Job, one has now heard &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, much, i.e., (in a pregnant sense) amply sufficient, although the word might signify elliptically (<a href="/psalms/106-43.htm">Psalm 106:43</a>; comp. <a href="/nehemiah/9-28.htm">Nehemiah 9:28</a>) many times (Jer. frequenter); multa (as <a href="/job/23-14.htm">Job 23:14</a>) is, however, equally suitable, and therefore is to be preferred as the more natural. <a href="/job/16-2.htm">Job 16:2</a> shows how &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; is intended; they are altogether &#1506;&#1502;&#1500; &#1502;&#1504;&#1495;&#1502;&#1497;, consolatores onerosi (Jer.), such as, instead of alleviating, only cause &#1506;&#1502;&#1500;, molestiam (comp. on <a href="/job/13-4.htm">Job 13:4</a>). In <a href="/job/16-3.htm">Job 16:3</a> Job returns their reproach of being windy, i.e., one without any purpose and substance, which they brought against him, <a href="/job/15-2.htm">Job 15:2</a>.: have windy words an end, or (&#1500;&#1493; vel   equals  &#1488;&#1501; in a disjunctive question, Ges. 155, 2, b) if not, what goads thee on to reply? &#1502;&#1512;&#1509; has been already discussed on <a href="/job/6-25.htm">Job 6:25</a>. The Targ. takes it in the sense of &#1502;&#1500;&#1509;: what makes it sweet to thee, etc.; the Jewish interpreters give it, without any proof, the signification, to be strong; the lxx transl. &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;, which is not transparent. Hirz., Ew., Schlottm., and others, call in the help of the Arabic marida (Aramaic &#1502;&#1512;&#1506;), to be sick, the IV. form of which signifies "to make sick," not "to injure." <p>(Note: The primary meaning of Arabic marida (root mr, stringere) is maceratum esse, by pressing, rubbing, beating, to be tender, enervated (Germ. dialectic and popul. abmaracht); comp. the nearest related maratsa, then maraza, marasa, maraa, and further, the development of the meaning of morbus and &#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;; - originally and first, of bodily sickness, then also of diseased affections and conditions of spirit, as envy, hatred, malice, etc.; vid., Sur. 2, v. 9, and Beidhwi thereon. - Fl.)<p>We keep to the primary meaning, to pierce, penetrate; Hiph. to goad, bring out, lacessere: what incites thee, that (&#1499;&#1497; as <a href="//biblehub.com/job/6-11.htm">Job 6:11</a>, quod not quum) thou repliest again? The collective thought of what follows is not that he also, if they were in his place, could do as they have done; that he, however, would not so act (thus e.g., Blumenfeld: with reasons for comfort I would overwhelm you, and sympathizingly shake my head over you, etc.). This rendering is destroyed by the shaking of the head, which is never a gesture of pure compassion, but always of malignant joy, Sir. 12:18; or of mockery at another's fall, <a href="/isaiah/37-22.htm">Isaiah 37:22</a>; and misfortune, <a href="/psalms/22-8.htm">Psalm 22:8</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/18-16.htm">Jeremiah 18:16</a>; <a href="/matthew/27-39.htm">Matthew 27:39</a>. Hence Merc. considers the antithesis to begin with <a href="//biblehub.com/job/16-5.htm">Job 16:5</a>, where, however, there is nothing to indicate it: minime id facerem, quin potius vos confirmarem ore meo - rather: that he also could display the same miserable consolation; he represents to them a change of their respective positions, in order that, as in a mirror, they may recognise the hatefulness of their conduct. The negative antecedent clause si essem (with &#1500;&#1493;&#1468;, according to Ges. 155, 2, f) is surrounded by cohortatives, which (since the interrogative form of interpretation is inadmissible) signify not only loquerer, but loqui possem, or rather loqui vellem (comp. e.g., <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/51-18.htm">Psalm 51:18</a>, dare vellem). When he says: I would range together, etc. (Carey: I would combine), he gives them to understand that their speeches are more artificial than natural, more declamations than the outgushings of the heart; instead of &#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, it is &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, since the object of the action is thought is as the means, as in <a href="/job/16-4.htm">Job 16:4</a> &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; &#1489;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;, capite meo (for caput meum, <a href="/psalms/22-8.htm">Psalm 22:8</a>), and &#1489;&#1468;&#1508;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/16-10.htm">Job 16:10</a>, for &#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;&#1501;, comp. <a href="/jeremiah/18-16.htm">Jeremiah 18:16</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/1-17.htm">Lamentations 1:17</a>, Ges. 138&#8224; ; Ew. takes &#1495;&#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1512; by comparison of the Arabic chbr, to know (the IV. form of which, achbara, however, signifies to cause to know, announce), in a sense that belongs neither to the Heb. nor to the Arab.: to affect wisdom. In <a href="/job/16-5.htm">Job 16:5</a> the chief stress is upon "with my mouth," without the heart being there, so also on the word "my lips," solace (&#1504;&#1497;&#1491; &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;., recalling <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/57-19.htm">Isaiah 57:19</a>, &#1504;&#1497;&#1489; &#1513;&#1474;&#1508;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501;, offspring or fruit of the lips) of my lips, i.e., dwelling only on the lips, and not coming from the heart. In ''&#1488;&#1488;&#1502;&#1468;&#1510;&#1499;&#1501; (Piel, not Hiph.) the Ssere is shortened to Chirek (Ges. 60, rem. 4).
