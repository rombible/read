Those who pass censures, must expect to have them retorted; it is easy, it is endless, but what good does it do? Angry answers stir up men's passions, but never convince their judgments, nor set truth in a clear light. What Job says of his friends is true of all creatures, in comparison with God; one time or other we shall be made to see and own that miserable comforters are they all. When under convictions of sin, terrors of conscience, or the arrests of death, only the blessed Spirit can comfort effectually; all others, without him, do it miserably, and to no purpose.

We have translated &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1488; by "evil" (Unheil), by which we have sought elsewhere to render &#1488;&#1493;&#1503;, in order that we might preserve the same word in both members of the verse.

The translation: then it is over with him (Ges., Schlottm., and others), is contrary to the usage of the language; and that given by the Jewish expositors, &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;  equals  &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1500; (abscinditur or conteritur), is a needlessly bold suggestion. - <a href="/job/15-32.htm">Job 15:32</a>. It is to be observed that &#1512;&#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1492; is Milel, and consequently 3 praet., not as in Sol 1:16 Milra, and consequently adj. &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1492; is not the branches generally (Luzzatto, with Raschi: branchage), but, as the proverbial expression for the high and low, <a href="/isaiah/9-13.htm">Isaiah 9:13</a>; <a href="/isaiah/19-15.htm">Isaiah 19:15</a> (vid., Dietrich, Abhandlung zur hebr. Gramm. S. 209), shows, the palm-branch bent downwards (comp. Targ. <a href="//biblehub.com/esther/1-5.htm">Esther 1:5</a>, where &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503; signifies seats and walks covered with foliage). "His palm-branch does not become green, or does not remain green" (which Symm. well renders: &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;), means that as he himself, the palm-trunk, so also his family, withers away. In <a href="/job/15-33.htm">Job 15:33</a> it is represented as &#1489;&#1468;&#1505;&#1512; ( equals  &#1489;&#1468;&#1505;&#1512;), wild grapes, or even unripe grapes of a vine, and as &#1504;&#1510;&#1468;&#1492;, flowers of an olive.<p>(Note: In order to appreciate the point of the comparison, it is needful to know that the Syrian olive-tree bears fruit plentifully the first, third, and fifth years, but rests during the second, fourth, and sixth. It blossoms in these years also, but the blossoms fall off almost entirely without any berries being formed. The harvest of the olive is therefore in such years very scanty. With respect to the vine, every year an enormous quantity of grapes are used up before they are ripe. When the berries are only about the size of a pea, the acid from them is used in housekeeping, to prepare almost every kind of food. The people are exceedingly fond of things sour, a taste which is caused by the heat of the climate. During the months of June, July, and August, above six hundred horses and asses laden with unripe grapes come daily to the market in Damascus alone, and during this season no one uses vinegar; hence the word &#1489;&#1505;&#1512;&#1488; signifies in Syriac the acid (vinegar) &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4; &#787; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;. In Arabic the unripe grapes are exclusively called hhossrum (Arab. htsrm), or, with a dialectic distinction, hissrim. - Wetzst.)<p>In <a href="/job/15-32.htm">Job 15:32</a> the godless man himself might be the subject: he casts down, like an olive-tree, his flowers, but in <a href="/job/15-32.htm">Job 15:32</a> this is inadmissible; if we interpret: "he shakes off (Targ. &#1497;&#1514;&#1468;&#1512;, excutiet), like a vine-stock, his young grapes," this (apart from the far-fetched meaning in &#1497;&#1495;&#1502;&#1505;) is a figure that is untrue to nature, since the grapes sit firmer the more unripe they are; and if one takes the first meaning of &#1495;&#1502;&#1505;, "he acts unjustly, as a vine, to his omphax" (e.g., Hupf.), whether it means that he does not let it ripen, or that he does not share with it any of the sweet sap, one has not only an indistinct figure, but also (since what God ordains for the godless is described as in operation) an awkward comparison. The subject of both verbs is therefore other than the vine and olive themselves. But why only an impersonal "one"? In <a href="/job/15-30.htm">Job 15:30</a> &#1512;&#1493;&#1495; &#1508;&#1497;&#1493; was referred to God, who is not expressly mentioned. God is also the subject here, and &#1497;&#1495;&#1502;&#1505;, which signifies to act with violence to one's self, is modified here to the sense of tearing away, as <a href="/lamentations/2-6.htm">Lamentations 2:6</a> (which Aben-Ezra has compared), of tearing out; &#1499;&#1490;&#1508;&#1503;, &#1499;&#1494;&#1497;&#1514;, prop. as a vine-stock, as an olive-tree, is equivalent to even as such an one.<p><a href="/job/15-34.htm">Job 15:34</a> declares the lot of the family of the ungodly, which has been thus figuratively described, without figure: the congregation (i.e., here: family-circle) of the ungodly (&#1495;&#1504;&#1507; according to its etymon inclinans, propensus ad malum, vid., on <a href="/job/13-16.htm">Job 13:16</a>) is (as it is expressed from the standpoint of the judgment that is executed) &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;, a hard, lifeless, stony mass (in the substantival sense of the Arabic galmu&#770;d instead of the adject. &#1490;&#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1491;&#1492;, <a href="/isaiah/49-21.htm">Isaiah 49:21</a>), i.e., stark dead (lxx &#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;; Aq., Symm., Theod., &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;), and fire has devoured the tents of bribery (after Ralbag: those built by bribery; or even after the lxx: &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2; &#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;). The ejaculatory conclusion, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/15-35.htm">Job 15:35</a>, gives the briefest expression to that which has been already described. The figurative language, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/15-35.htm">Job 15:35</a>, is like <a href="/psalms/7-15.htm">Psalm 7:15</a>; <a href="/isaiah/59-4.htm">Isaiah 59:4</a> (comp. supra, p. 257); in the latter passage similar vividly descriptive infinitives are found (Ges. 131, 4, b). They hatch the burdens or sorrow of others, and what comes from it is evil for themselves.
