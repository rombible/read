No one was ever more ready to acknowledge sins of infirmity. Eliphaz had charged him with hypocrisy in religion, but he specifies prayer, the great act of religion, and professes that in this he was pure, though not from all infirmity. He had a God to go to, who he doubted not took full notice of all his sorrows. Those who pour out tears before God, though they cannot plead for themselves, by reason of their defects, have a Friend to plead for them, even the Son of man, and on him we must ground all our hopes of acceptance with God. To die, is to go the way whence we shall not return. We must all of us, very certainly, and very shortly, go this journey. Should not then the Saviour be precious to our souls? And ought we not to be ready to obey and to suffer for his sake? If our consciences are sprinkled with his atoning blood, and testify that we are not living in sin or hypocrisy, when we go the way whence we shall not return, it will be a release from prison, and an entrance into everlasting happiness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Oh that one might plead for a man - A more correct rendering of this would be, "Oh that it might be for a man to contend with God;" that is, in a judicial controversy. It is the expression of an earnest desire to carry his cause at once before God, and to be permitted to argue it there. This desire Job had often expressed; see <a href="//biblehub.com/job/13-3.htm">Job 13:3</a>, note; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/13-18.htm">Job 13:18-22</a>, notes. On the grammatical construction of the passage, see Rosenmuller.<p>As a man pleadeth for his neighbour - Hebrew "the son of man;" that is, the offspring of man. Or, rather, as a man contendeth with his neighbor; as one man may carry on a cause with another. He desired to carry his cause directly before God, and to be permitted to argue the case with him, as one is permitted to maintain an argument with a man; see the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/job/13-20.htm">Job 13:20-21</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21. one&#8212;rather, "He" (God). "Oh, that He would plead for a man (namely, me) against God." Job quaintly says, "God must support me against God; for He makes me to suffer, and He alone knows me to be innocent" [Umbreit]. So God helped Jacob in wrestling against Himself (compare Job 23:6; Ge 32:25). God in Jesus Christ does plead with God for man (Ro 8:26, 27).<p>as a man&#8212;literally, "the Son of man." A prefiguring of the advocacy of Jesus Christ&#8212;a boon longed for by Job (Job 9:33), though the spiritual pregnancy of his own words, designed for all ages, was but little understood by him (Ps 80:17).<p>for his neighbour&#8212;Hebrew, "friend." Job himself (Job 42:8) pleaded as intercessor for his "friends," though "his scorners" (Job 16:20); so Jesus Christ the Son of man (Lu 23:34); "for friends" (Joh 15:13-15).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/job/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Oh that either I or some faithful advocate might be admitted to plead any cause, either with God, or rather with you, before God’s tribunal, God being witness and judge between us! But this verse is, and that very agreeably to the Hebrew text, otherwise translated and interpreted; either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. With respect to Christ, <span class="ital">And he</span> (i.e. God, last mentioned, to wit, God the Son, Christ Jesus) <span class="ital">will plead for a man</span> (i.e. for me, against whom you plead.) He modestly speaketh of himself in the third person, as is usual) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">with God</span> (to wit, with God the Father; and the Son of man (as Christ is oft called) <span class="ital">will plead for his friend, or companion, or neighbour</span>, i.e. for a man whom he hath taken into that relation to himself. It is plain that the mystery of man’s redemption by Christ was known to the ancient patriarchs, as hath been oft noted before; and to Job among others, <span class="bld"><a href="/job/19-25.htm" title="For I know that my redeemer lives, and that he shall stand at the latter day on the earth:">Job 19:25</a></span>. Or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2.

This seems most agreeable to the scope of the place, which was to maintain his own integrity against his friends before God. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/job/16.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Oh that one might plead for a man with God,.... That is, that one might be appointed and allowed to plead with God on his account; or that he be admitted to plead with God for himself; or however, that there might be a hearing of his case before God, and that he would decide the thing in controversy between him and his friends, when he doubted not but it would be given on his side: <p>as a man pleadeth for his neighbour; using great freedom, and powerful arguments, and having no dread of the judge, nor fear of carrying the cause for his neighbour; so Job wishes, that either one for him, or he himself, might be freed from the dread of the divine Majesty, and might be suffered to speak as freely to his case as a counsellor at the bar does for his client. The words will admit of a more evangelic sense by observing that God, to whom Job says his eye poured out tears, at the close of <a href="//biblehub.com/job/16-20.htm">Job 16:20</a>, is to be understood of the second Person in the Godhead, Jehovah, the Son of God, the Messiah; and then read these words that follow thus, "and he will plead for a man with God, and the Son of man for his friend"; which last clause perhaps may be better rendered, "even the Son of man", &amp;c. and so they are expressive of Job's faith, that though his friends despised him, yet he to whom he poured out his tears, and committed his case, would plead his cause with God for him, and thoroughly plead it, when he should be acquitted. The appellation, "the Son of man", is a well known name for the Messiah in the New Testament, and is not altogether unknown in the Old, see <a href="/psalms/80-17.htm">Psalm 80:17</a>; and one part of his work and office is to be an advocate with the Father for his friends, whom he makes, reckons, and uses as such, even all the Father has given him, and he has redeemed by his blood; for these he pleads his blood, righteousness, and sacrifice, to the satisfaction of the law, and justice of God, and against Satan, and all enemies whatever, and for every blessing they want; and for which work he is abundantly fit, because of the dignity of his person, his nearness to God his Father, and the interest he has in him. Gussetius (l) goes this way, and observes that this sense has not been taken notice of by interpreters, which he seems to wonder at; whereas our English annotator on the place had it long ago, and Mr. Caryll after him, though disapproved of by some modern interpreters. <p>(l) Ebr.

It may mean, <span class="accented">Oh that he</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> God himself) <span class="accented">would plead for a man with God! i.e.</span> would become a Mediator between himself and man, plead for him, undertake his defence, and obtain for him merciful consideration. Or, nearly as in the Authorized Version, <span class="accented">Oh that one might plead for man</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> mankind at large) <span class="accented">with God!</span> interest him on their behalf, and obtain a merciful judgment for them. The former rendering is to be preferred. <span class="cmt_word">As a man pleadeth for his neighbour</span>; literally, <span class="accented">as a son of man</span> (or, as <span class="accented">the Son of man</span>) <span class="accented">pleadeth for his neighbour.</span> If we take the simpler rendering, "as a son of man," then the meaning is simply, "Oh that God would plead for man with himself, as a man is wont to plead for his fellow-man!" But if we prefer the other rendering, "as the Son of man," a Messianic interpretation will be necessary. (So Professor Lee and Dr. Stanley Leathes) But Messianic interpretations of passages that do not require them, and that have no such traditional interpretation, require extreme caution. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/16.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>15  I sewed sackcloth upon my skin,<p>And defiled my horn with dust.<p>16  My face is exceeding red with weeping,<p>And on mine eyelids is the shadow of death,<p>17  Although there is no wrong in my hand,<p>And my prayer is pure.<p>Coarse-haired cloth is the recognised clothing which the deeply sorrowful puts on, &#x3b9;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;, as the Greek expositors remark. Job does not say of it that he put it on or slung it round him, but that he sewed it upon his naked body; and this is to be attributed to the hideous distortion of the body by elephantiasis, which will not admit of the use of the ordinary form of clothes. For the same reason he also uses, not &#1506;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;, but &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;, which signifies either the scurfy scaly surface (as &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1491; and &#1492;&#1504;&#1500;&#1497;&#1491; in Talmudic of the scab of a healing wound, but also occurring e.g., of the bedaggled edge of clothes when it has become dry), or scornfully describes the skin as already almost dead; for the healthy skin is called &#1506;&#1494;&#1512;, &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1491;, on the other hand, &#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x3b1; (lxx), hide (esp. when removed from the body), Talm. e.g., sole-leather. We prefer the former interpretation (adopted by Raschi and others): The crust in which the terrible lepra has clothed his skin (vid., on <a href="/job/7-5.htm">Job 7:5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/30-18.htm">Job 30:18-19</a>, <a href="/job/30-30.htm">Job 30:30</a>) is intended. &#1506;&#1500;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; in <a href="/job/16-15.htm">Job 16:15</a> is referred by Rosenm., Hirz., Ges., and others (as indeed by Saad. and Gecat., who transl. "I digged into"), to &#1506;&#1500;&#1500; (Arab. gll), to enter, penetrate: "I stuck my horn in the dust;" but this signification of the Hebrew &#1506;&#1500;&#1500; is unknown, it signifies rather to inflict pain, or scorn (e.g., <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/3-51.htm">Lamentations 3:51</a>, mine eye causeth pain to my soul), generally with &#1500;, here with the accusative: I have misused, i.e., injured or defiled (as the Jewish expositors explain), my horn with dust. This is not equivalent to my head (as in the Syr. version), but he calls everything that was hitherto his power and pride &#1511;&#1512;&#1504;&#1497; (lxx, Targ.); all this he has together at the same time injured, i.e., represented as come to destruction, by covering his head with dust and ashes.</body></html>
