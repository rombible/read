They are desolate with want and famine. They flee into the wilderness on the eve of wasteness and desolation, or when all is dark (yester night), waste, and desolate.

What little cause have men to be ambitious or proud of that which may be so easily lost, and what little confidence is to be put in it! We should not be cast down if we are despised, reviled, and hated by wicked men. We should look to Jesus, who endured the contradiction of sinners.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Yea, whereto might the strength of their hands profit me - There has been much difference of opinion respecting the meaning of this passage. The general sense is clear. Job means to describe those who were reduced by poverty and want, and who were without respectability or home, and who had no power in any way to affect him. He states that they were so abject and worthless as not to be worth his attention; but even this fact is intended to show how low he was himself reduced, since even the most degraded ranks in life did not show any respect to one who had been honored by princes. The Vulgate renders this, "The strength - virtus - of whose hands is to me as nothing, and they are regarded as unworthy of life." The Septuagint, "And the strength of their hands what is it to me? Upon whom perfection - &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;  sunteleia - has perished." Coverdale, "The power and strength of their hands might do me no good, and as for their age, it is spent and passed away without any profit." The literal translation is, "Even the strength of their hands, what is it to me?" The meaning is, that their power was not worth regarding. They were abject, feeble, and reduced by hunger - poor emaciated creatures, who could do him neither good nor evil. Yet this fact did not make him feel less the indignity of being treated by such vagrants with scorn.<p>In whom old age was perished - Or, rather, in whom vigor, or the power of accomplishing, anything, has ceased. The word &#1499;&#1500;&#1495;  kelach, means "completion," or the act or power of finishing or completing anything. Then it denotes old age - age as "finished" or "completed;" <a href="/job/5-26.htm">Job 5:26</a>. Here it means the maturity or vigor which would enable a man to complete or accomplish anything, and the idea is, that in these persons this had utterly perished. Reduced by hunger and want, they had no power of effecting anything, and were unworthy of regard. The word used here occurs only in this book in Hebrew J<a href="/obadiah/5-26.htm">Obadiah 5:26</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/30-2.htm">Job 30:2</a>, but is common in Arabic; where it refers to the "wrinkles," the "wanness," and the "austere aspect" of the countenance, especially in age. See "Castell's Lex." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/30.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. If their fathers could be of no profit to me, much less the sons, who are feebler than their sires; and in whose case the hope of attaining old age is utterly gone, so puny are they (Job 5:26) [Maurer]. Even if they had "strength of hands," that could be now of no use to me, as all I want in my present affliction is sympathy.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/job/30.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Nor was it strange that I did, or would. or might refuse to take them into any of my meanest services, because they were utterly impotent, and therefore unserviceable. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In whom old age was perished; </span> or, lost; either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. Because they never attain to it, but are consumed by their lusts or cut off for their wickedness by the just hand of God, or men, in the midst of their days. Or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. Because they had so wasted their strength and spirits by their evil courses, that when they came to old age, they were feeble and decrepit, and useless for any labour. Or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3.

And if this word do signify <span class="ital">old age</span>, yet it signifies not every, but only a flourishing and vigorous, old age; as the Hebrews note, and the word may seem to imply; whence the LXX. interpreters also render it <span class="ital">perfection</span>, to wit, of age, and of thee endowments belonging to age. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/job/30.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Yea, whereto might the strength of their hands profit me,.... For though they were strong, lusty, hale men, able to do business, yet their strength was to sit still and fold their hands in their bosoms, so that their strength was of no profit or avail to themselves or others; they were so slothful and lazy, that Job could not employ them in any business of his to any advantage to himself; and this may be one reason, among others, why he disdained to set them with the dogs of his flock to keep it; for the fathers seem to be intended all along to <a href="/job/30-8.htm">Job 30:8</a>; though it matters not much to which of them the words are applied, since they were like father like son: <p>in whom old age was perished? who did not arrive to old age, but were soon consumed by their lusts, or cut off for their sins; and so the strength and labour of their hands, had they been employed, would have been of little worth; because the time of their continuance in service would have been short, especially being idle and slothful: some understand it of a lively and vigorous old age, such as was in Moses; but this being not in them, they were unfit for business, see <a href="/job/5-26.htm">Job 5:26</a>; or they had not the endowments of old age, the experience, wisdom, and prudence of ancient persons, to contrive, conduct, and manage affairs, or direct in the management of them, which would make up for lack of strength and labour. Ben Gersom, Bar Tzemach, and others, interpret the word of time, or the time of life, that was perished or lost in them; their whole course of life, being spent in sloth and idleness, was all lost time. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/30.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Yea, whereto <i>might</i> the strength of their hands <i>profit</i> me, in whom old age was <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> perished?</span><p>(c) That is, their fathers died of hunger before they came to age.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/job/30.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2</span>.

Yet the children of these miserable people now have him in derision.

An effete race seems to be pointed at, without strength or stamina, nerveless, spiritless, "destined to early decay and premature death;" but how they had sunk into such a condition is not apparent.

If he gave counsel, they waited in strictest silence: this is the meaning of &#1497;&#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468; (fut. Kal of &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1501;); &#1500;&#1502;&#1493;, poetic for &#1500;, refers the silence to its outward cause (vid., on <a href="/habakkuk/3-16.htm">Habakkuk 3:16</a>). After his words non iterabant, i.e., as Jerome explanatorily translates: addere nihil audebant, and his speech came down upon them relieving, rejoicing, and enlivening them. The figure indicated in &#1514;&#1468;&#1496;&#1468;&#1507; is expanded in <a href="/job/29-23.htm">Job 29:23</a> after <a href="/deuteronomy/32-2.htm">Deuteronomy 32:2</a> : they waited on his word, which penetrated deeply, even to the heart, as for rain, &#1502;&#1496;&#1512;, by which, as <a href="//biblehub.com/job/29-23.htm">Job 29:23</a>, the so-called (autumnal) early rain which moistens the seed is prominently thought of. They open their mouth for the late rain, &#1502;&#1500;&#1511;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473; (vid., on <a href="/job/24-6.htm">Job 24:6</a>), i.e., they thirsted after his words, which were like the March or April rain, which helps to bring to maturity the corn that is soon to be reaped; this rain frequently fails, and is therefore the more longed for. &#1508;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512; &#1508;&#1468;&#1492; is to be understood according to <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/119-131.htm">Psalm 119:131</a>, comp. <a href="/psalms/81-11.htm">Psalm 81:11</a>; and one must consider, in connection with it, what raptures the beginning of the periodical rains produces everywhere, where, as e.g., in Jerusalem, the people have been obliged for some time to content themselves with cisterns that are almost dried to a marsh, and how the old and young dance for joy at their arrival!<p>In <a href="/job/29-24.htm">Job 29:24</a> a thought as suited to the syntax as to the fact is gained if we translate: "I smiled to them - they believed it not," i.e., they considered such condescension as scarcely possible (Saad., Raschi, Rosenm., De Wette, Schlottm., and others); &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1495;&#1511; is then fut. hypotheticum, as <a href="/job/10-16.htm">Job 10:16</a>; <a href="/job/20-24.htm">Job 20:24</a>; <a href="/job/22-27.htm">Job 22:27</a>., Ew. 357, b. But it does not succeed in putting <a href="/job/29-24.htm">Job 29:24</a> in a consistent relation to this thought; for, with Aben-Ezra, to explain: they did not esteem my favour the less on that account, my respect suffered thereby no loss among them, is not possible in connection with the biblical idea of "the light of the countenance;" and with Schlottm. to explain: they let not the light of my countenance, i.e., token of my favour, fall away, i.e., be in vain, is contrary to the usage of the language, according to which &#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500; &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; signifies: to cause the countenance to sink (gloomily, <a href="/genesis/4-5.htm">Genesis 4:5</a>), whether one's own, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-12.htm">Jeremiah 3:12</a>, or that of another. Instead of &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; we have a more pictorial and poetical expression here, &#1488;&#1493;&#1512; &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;: light of my countenance, i.e., my cheerfulness (as <a href="/proverbs/16-15.htm">Proverbs 16:15</a>). Moreover, the &#1488;&#1513;&#1474;&#1495;&#1511; &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;, therefore, furnishes the thought that he laughed, and did not allow anything to dispossess him of his easy and contented disposition. Thus, therefore, those to whom Job laughed are to be thought of as in a condition and mood which his cheerfulness might easily sadden, but still did not sadden; and this their condition is described by &#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1488;&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; (a various reading in Codd. and editions is &#1493;&#1500;&#1488;), a phrase which occurred before (<a href="/job/24-22.htm">Job 24:22</a>) in the signification of being without faith or hope, despairing (comp. &#1492;&#1488;&#1502;&#1497;&#1503;, to gain faith, <a href="/psalms/116-10.htm">Psalm 116:10</a>), - a clause which is not to be taken as attributive (Umbr., Vaih.: who had not confidence), but as a neutral or circumstantial subordinate clause (Ew. 341, a). Therefore translate: I smiled to them, if they believed not, i.e., despaired; and however despondent their position appeared, the cheerfulness of my countenance they could not cause to pass away. However gloomy they were, they could not make me gloomy and off my guard. Thus also <a href="/job/29-25.htm">Job 29:25</a> is now suitably attached to the preceding: I chose their way, i.e., I made the way plain, which they should take in order to get out of their hopeless and miserable state, and sat as chief, as a king who is surrounded by an armed host as a defence and as a guard of honour, attentive to the motion of his eye; not, however, as a sovereign ruler, but as one who condescended to the mourners, and comforted them (&#1504;&#1495;&#1501; Piel, properly to cause to breathe freely). This peaceful figure of a king brings to mind the warlike one, <a href="/job/15-24.htm">Job 15:24</a>. &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; is not a conj. here, but equivalent to &#1499;&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, ut (quis) qui; consequently not: as one comforts, but: as he who comforts; lxx correctly: &#x3bf;&#788;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;. The accentuation (&#1499;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; Tarcha, &#1488;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; Munach, &#1497;&#1504;&#1495;&#1501; Silluk) is erroneous; &#1499;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; should be marked with Rebia mugrasch, and &#1488;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; with Mercha-Zinnorith.<p>From the prosperous and happy past, absolutely passed, Job now turns to the present, which contrasts so harshly with it. </body></html>
