It is not probable that Job here refers to his three friends. It is not possible to determine their age with accuracy, but in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/15-10.htm">Job 15:10</a>, they claim that there were with them old and very aged men, much older than the father of Job. Though that place may possibly refer not to themselves but to those who held the same opinions with them, yet none of those who engaged in the discussion, except Ehhu <a href="//biblehub.com/job/32-6.htm">Job 32:6</a>, are represented as young men. They were the contemporaries of Job; men who are ranked as his friends; and men who showed that they had had oppoptunities for long and careful observation. The reference here, therefore, is to the fact that while, in the days of his prosperity, even the aged and the honorable rose up to do him reverence, now he was the object of contempt even by the young and the worthless. The Orientals would feel this much. It was among the chief virtues with them to show respect to the aged, and their sensibilites were especially keen in regard to any indignity shown to them by the young.<p>Whose fathers I would have disdained - Who are the children of the lowest and most degraded of the community.

That is, they were held in less esteem than his dogs. This was the lowest conceivable point of debasement.

A general description: Job 30:1-8, the lowness of the persons who derided him; Job 30:9-15, the derision itself. Formerly old men rose to me (Job 29:8). Now not only my juniors, who are bound to reverence me (Le 19:32), but even the mean and base-born actually deride me; opposed to, "smiled upon" (Job 29:24). This goes farther than even the "mockery" of Job by relations and friends (Job 12:4; 16:10, 20; 17:2, 6; 19:22). Orientals feel keenly any indignity shown by the young. Job speaks as a rich Arabian emir, proud of his descent.<p>dogs&#8212;regarded with disgust in the East as unclean (1Sa 17:43; Pr 26:11). They are not allowed to enter a house, but run about wild in the open air, living on offal and chance morsels (Ps 59:14, 15). Here again we are reminded of Jesus Christ (Ps 22:16).

Having drawn the portrait of himself as he was, rich, honoured, blessed with children, flourishing, in favour with both God and man, Job now presents himself to us as he is, despised of men (vers. 1-10), afflicted of God (ver. 11), a prey to vague terrors (ver. 15), tortured with bodily pains (vers. 17, 18), cast off by God (vers. 19, 20), with nothing but death to look for (vers. 23-31).

The calculation of the immense total of grains of sand (atoms) in the world was, as is known, a favourite problem of antiquity; and in the Old Testament Scriptures, the comprehensive knowledge of Solomon is compared to "the sand upon the sea-shore," <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/5-9.htm">1 Kings 5:9</a>, - how much more readily a long life reduced to days! comp. Ovid, Metam. xiv. 136-138; quot haberet corpora pulvis, tot mihi natales contingere vana rogavi. We would willingly decide in favour of this rendering, which is admissible in itself, although a closer definition like &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1501; is wanting by &#1499;&#1495;&#1493;&#1500;, if an extensive Jewish tradition did not secure the signification of an immortal bird, or rather one rising ever anew from the dead. The testimony is as follows: (1) b. Sanhedrin 108b, according to which &#1495;&#1493;&#1500; is only another name for the bird &#1488;&#1493;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1504;&#1488;,<p>(Note: The name is a puzzle, and does not accord with any of the mythical birds mentioned in the Zendavesta (vid., Windischmann, Zoroastrische Studien, 1863, S. 93). What Lewysohn, Zoologie des Talmuds, S. 353, brings forward from the Greek by way of explanation is untenable. The name of the bird, Vresha, in an obscure passage of the Bundehesch in Windischmann, ib. S. 80, is similar in sound. Probably, however, &#1488;&#1493;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1504;&#1488; is one and the same word as Simurg, which is composed of si ( equals  sin) and murg, a bird (Pehlvi and Parsi mru). This si (sin) corresponds to the Vedic jena, a falcon, and in the Zend form, ana (na), is the name of a miraculous bird; so that consequently Simurg  equals  Sinmurg, Parsi Cnamru, signifies the Si- or Cna-bird (comp. Kuhn, Herabkunft des Feuers, 1859, S. 125). In &#1488;&#1493;&#1512;&#1513;&#1497;&#1504;&#1488; the two parts of the composition seem to be reversed, and &#1488;&#1493;&#1512; to be corrupted from &#1502;&#1493;&#1512;. Moreover, the Simurg is like the phoenix only in the length of its life; another mythological bird, Kuknus, on the other hand (vid., the art. Phnix in Ersch u. Gruber), resembles it also in rising out of its own ashes.)<p>of which the fable is there recorded, that when Noah fed the beasts in the ark, it sat quite still in its compartment, that it might not give more trouble to the patriarch, who had otherwise plenty to do, and that Noah wished it on this account the reward of immortality (&#1497;&#1492;&#1488; &#1512;&#1506;&#1493;&#1488; &#1491;&#1500;&#1488; &#1514;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;).   (2) That this bird &#1495;&#1493;&#1500; is none other than the phoenix, is put beyond all doubt by the Midrashim (collected in the Jalkut on Job, 517). There it is said that Eve gave all the beasts to eat of the fruit of the forbidden tree, and that only one bird, the &#1495;&#1493;&#1500; by name, avoided this death-food: "it lives a thousand years, at the expiration of which time fire springs up in its nest, and burns it up to about the size of an egg;" or even: that of itself it diminishes to that size, from which it then grows up again and continues to live (&#1493;&#1495;&#1493;&#1494;&#1512; &#1493;&#1502;&#1514;&#1490;&#1491;&#1500; &#1488;&#1497;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1493;&#1495;&#1497;&#1492;).   (3) The Masora observes, that &#1499;&#1495;&#1493;&#1500; occurs in two different significations (&#1489;&#1514;&#1512;&#1497; &#1500;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;), since in the present passage it does not, as elsewhere, signify sand. (4) Kimchi, in his Lex., says: "in a correct Jerusalem MS I found the observation: &#1489;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1512;&#1511; &#1500;&#1504;&#1492;&#1512;&#1491;&#1506;&#1497; &#1493;&#1489;&#1495;&#1500;&#1501; &#1500;&#1502;&#1506;&#1512;&#1489;&#1488;&#1497;, i.e., &#1493;&#1499;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500; according to the Nehardean (Babylonian) reading, &#1493;&#1499;&#1495;&#1493;&#1500; according to the western (Palestine) reading;" according to which, therefore, the Babylonian Masoretic school distinguished &#1493;&#1499;&#1495;&#1493;&#1500; in the present passage from &#1493;&#1499;&#1495;&#1493;&#1500;, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/22-17.htm">Genesis 22:17</a>, even in the pronunciation. A conclusion respecting the great antiquity of this lexical tradition may be drawn (5) from the lxx, which translates &#x3c9;&#788;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1; &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, whence the Italic sicut arbor palmae, Jerome sicut palma.<p>If we did not know from the testimonies quoted that &#1495;&#1493;&#1500; is the name of the phoenix, one might suppose that the lxx has explained &#1493;&#1499;&#1495;&#1493;&#1500; according to the Arab. nachl, the palm, as Schultens does; but by a comparison of those testimonies, it is more probable that the translation was &#x3c9;&#788;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1; &#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3be; originally, and that &#x3c9;&#788;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1; &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; is an interpolation, for &#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3be; signifies both the immortal miraculous bird and the inexhaustibly youthful palm.<p>(Note: According to Ovid, Metam. xv. 396, the phoenix makes its nest in the palm, and according to Pliny, h. n. xiii. 42, it has its name from the palm: Phoenix putatur ex hujus palmae argumento nomen accepisse, iterum mori ac renasci ex se ipsa; vid., A. Hahmann, Die Dattelpalme, ihre Namen und ihre Verehrung in der alten Welt, in the periodical Bonplandia, 1859, Nr. 15, 16. Masius, in his studies of nature, has very beautifully described on what ground "the intelligent Greek gave a like name to the fabulous immortal bird that rises again out of its own ashes, and the palm which ever renews its youth."

Ep. ad Corinth. c. xxv., according to which the phoenix is an Arabian bird, which lives five hundred years, then dies in a nest which it builds of incense, myrrh, and spices, and leaves behind it the larva of a young bird, which, when grown up, brings the nest with the bones of its father and places it upon the altar of the sun at the Egyptian Heliopolis. The source of this is Herodotus ii. 73) who, however, has an egg of myrrh instead of a nest of myrrh); and Tacitus, Ann. vi. 28, gives a similar narrative. Lactantius gives a different version in his poem on the phoenix, according to which this, the only one of its race, "built its nest in a country that remained untouched by the deluge." The Jewish tragedy writer, Ezekilos, agrees more nearly with the statement of Arabia being the home of the phoenix. In his drama &#x395;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#769;, a spy sent forward before the pilgrim band of Israel, he states that among other things the phoenix was also seen; vid., my Gesch. der jd.
