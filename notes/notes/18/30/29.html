Harbouring hard thoughts of God was the sin which did, at this time, most easily beset Job. When inward temptations join with outward calamities, the soul is hurried as in a tempest, and is filled with confusion. But woe be to those who really have God for an enemy! Compared with the awful state of ungodly men, what are all outward, or even inward temporal afflictions? There is something with which Job comforts himself, yet it is but a little. He foresees that death will be the end of all his troubles. God's wrath might bring him to death; but his soul would be safe and happy in the world of spirits. If none pity us, yet our God, who corrects, pities us, even as a father pitieth his own children. And let us look more to the things of eternity: then the believer will cease from mourning, and joyfully praise redeeming love.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I am a brother to dragons - That is, my loud complaints and cries resemble the doleful screams of wild animals, or of the most frightful monsters. The word "brother" is often used in this sense, to denote similarity in any respect. The word "dragons" here (&#1514;&#1504;&#1497;&#1503;  tann&#305;&#770;yn), denotes properly a sea-monster, a great fish, a crocodile; or the fancied animal with wings called a dragon; see the notes at <a href="/isaiah/13-22.htm">Isaiah 13:22</a>. Gesenius, Umbreit, and Noyes, render this word here jackals - an animal between a dog and a fox, or a wolf and a fox; an animal that abounds in deserts and solitudes, and that makes a doleful cry in the night. So the Syriac renders it an animal resembling a dog; a wild dog. Castell. This idea agrees with the scope of the passage better than the common reference to a sea-monster or a crocodile. "The Deeb, or Jackal," says Shaw, "is of a darker color than the fox, and about the same bigness. It yelps every night about the gardens and villages, feeding upon roots, fruit, and carrion." Travels, p. 247, Ed. Oxford, 1738. That some wild animal, distinguished for a mournful noise, or howl, is meant, is evident; and the passage better agrees with the description of a jackal than the hissing of a serpent or the noise of the crocodile. Bochart supposes that the allusion is to dragons, because they erect their heads, and their jaws are drawn open, and they seem to be complaining against God on account of their humble and miserable condition. Taylor (Concord.) supposes it means jackals or thoes, and refers to the following places where the word may be so used; <a href="/psalms/44-19.htm">Psalm 44:19</a>; <a href="/isaiah/13-22.htm">Isaiah 13:22</a>; <a href="/isaiah/34-13.htm">Isaiah 34:13</a>; <a href="/isaiah/35-7.htm">Isaiah 35:7</a>; <a href="/isaiah/43-20.htm">Isaiah 43:20</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/11-11.htm">Jeremiah 11:11</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/10-22.htm">Jeremiah 10:22</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/49-33.htm">Jeremiah 49:33</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/51-37.htm">Jeremiah 51:37</a>; <a href="/lamentations/4-3.htm">Lamentations 4:3</a>; <a href="/micah/1-8.htm">Micah 1:8</a>; <a href="/malachi/1-3.htm">Malachi 1:3</a>.<p>And a companion to owls - Margin, ostriches. The word companion here is used in a sense similar to brother in the other member of the parallelism, to denote resemblance. The Hebrew, here rendered owls, is, literally, daughters of answering, or clamor - &#1497;&#1506;&#1504;&#1492; &#1489;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;  beno&#770;th ya&#8219;a&#774;na&#770;h. The name is given on account of the plaintive and mournful cry which is made. Bochart. Gesenius supposes, however, that it is on account of its greediness and gluttony. The name "daughters of the ostrich." denotes properly the female ostrich. The phrase is, however, put for the ostrich of both sexes in many places; see Gesenius on the word &#1497;&#1506;&#1504;&#1492;  ya&#8219;a&#774;na&#770;h; compare the notes at <a href="/isaiah/13-21.htm">Isaiah 13:21</a>. For a full examination of the meaning of the phrase, see Bochart, Hieroz. P. ii. L. 2. cap. xiv. pp. 218-231; see also <a href="//biblehub.com/job/39-13.htm">Job 39:13-17</a>. There can be little doubt that the ostrich is here intended, and Job means to say that his mourning resembled the doleful noise made by the ostrich in the lonely desert. Shaw, in his Travels, says that during the night "they (the ostriches) make very doleful and hideous noises; which would sometimes be like the roaring of a lion; at other times it would bear a nearer resemblance to the hoarser voice of other quadrupeds, particularly of the bull and the ox. I have often heard them groan as if they were in the greatest agonies." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/30.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>29. dragons &#8230; owls&#8212;rather, "jackals," "ostriches," both of which utter dismal screams (Mic 1:8); in which respect, as also in their living amidst solitudes (the emblem of desolation), Job is their brother and companion; that is, resembles them. "Dragon," Hebrew, tannim, usually means the crocodile; so perhaps here, its open jaws lifted towards heaven, and its noise making it seem as if it mourned over its fate [Bochart].<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/job/30.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">A brother, </span> to wit, by imitation of their cries: persons of like qualities are oft called brethren, as <span class="bld"><a href="/genesis/49-5.htm" title="Simeon and Levi are brothers; instruments of cruelty are in their habitations.">Genesis 49:5</a> <a href="/proverbs/18-9.htm" title="He also that is slothful in his work is brother to him that is a great waster.">Proverbs 18:9</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">To dragons; </span> which howl and wail mournfully in the deserts, <span class="bld"><a href="/micah/1-8.htm" title="Therefore I will wail and howl, I will go stripped and naked: I will make a wailing like the dragons, and mourning as the owls.">Micah 1:8</a></span>, either through hunger or thirst, or when he fights with and is beaten by the elephant. <span class="ital">To owls</span>; whose sad and mournful noises are known.

It is impossible to draw the &#1500;&#1488;, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/30-20.htm">Job 30:20</a>, over to &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1514;&#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1503; (Jer., Saad., Umbr., Welte, and others), both on account of the Waw consec.

On the reading of two Codd. &#1493;&#1514;&#1514;&#1499;&#1504;&#1503; ("Thou settest Thyself against me"), which Houbigant and Ew. prefer, Rosenm. has correctly pronounced judgment: est potius pro mendo habenda. Instead of consolingly answering his prayer, and instead of showing Himself willing to help, God, who was formerly so kind towards him, changes towards him, His creature, into a cruel being, saevum (&#1488;&#1499;&#1494;&#1512; in the book of Job only here and <a href="//biblehub.com/job/41-2.htm">Job 41:2</a>, where it signifies "foolhardy;" comp. &#1500;&#1488;&#1493;&#1497;&#1489; in the dependent passage, <a href="/isaiah/63-10.htm">Isaiah 63:10</a>), and makes war upon him (&#1513;&#1474;&#1496;&#1501; as <a href="/job/16-9.htm">Job 16:9</a>) by causing him to feel the strength of His omnipotent hand (&#1506;&#1510;&#1501; &#1497;&#1491; as <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-17.htm">Deuteronomy 8:17</a>, synon. &#1495;&#1494;&#1511;).<p>It is not necessary in <a href="/job/30-22.htm">Job 30:22</a> to forsake the accentuation, and to translate: Thou raisest me up, Thou causest me go in the wind (Ew., Hirz., and others); the accentuation of &#1512;&#1493;&#1495; is indeed not a disjunctive Dech, but a conjunctive Tarcha, but preceded by Munach, which, according to the rule, Psalter ii. 500, 5, here, where two conjunctives come together, has a smaller conjunctive value. Therefore: elevas me in ventum, equitare facis me, viz., super ventum (Dachselt), for one does not only say &#1492;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1489; &#1506;&#1500;,   <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/13-7.htm">1 Chronicles 13:7</a>, or &#1500;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/66-12.htm">Psalm 66:12</a>, but also &#1488;&#1500;, <a href="/2_samuel/6-3.htm">2 Samuel 6:3</a>; and accordingly &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488;&#1504;&#1497; &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; is also not to be translated: Thou snatchest me into the wind or storm (Hahn, Schlottm.), but: Thou raisest me up to the wind or storm, as upon an animal for riding (Umbr., Olsh.). According to Oriental tradition, Solomon rode upon the east wind, and in Arabic they say of one who hurried rapidly by, racab al-gena&#770;hai er-rih, he rides upon the wings of the wind; in the present passage, the point of comparison is the being absolutely passively hurried forth from the enjoyment of a healthy and happy life to a dizzy height, whence a sudden overthrow threatens him who is unwillingly removed (comp. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/102-11.htm">Psalm 102:11</a>, Thou hast lifted me up and hurled me forth).<p>The lot which threatens him from this painful suspense Job expresses (<a href="/job/30-22.htm">Job 30:22</a>) in the puzzling words: &#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1502;&#1490;&#1490;&#1504;&#1497; &#1514;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;. Thus the Keri, after which lxx transl. (if it has not read &#1502;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492;), &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b7;&#x3b9;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c2; &#x3bc;&#x3b5; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;. The modern expositors who follow the Keri, by taking &#1493;&#1514;&#1502;&#1490;&#1490;&#1504;&#1497; for &#1493;&#1514;&#1502;&#1490;&#1490; &#1500;&#1497; (according to Ges. 121, 4), translate: Thou causest counsel and understanding (Welte), happiness (Blumenf.), and the like, to vanish from me; continuance, existence, duration would be better (vid., <a href="//biblehub.com/job/6-13.htm">Job 6:13</a>, and especially on <a href="/job/26-3.htm">Job 26:3</a>). The thought it appropriate, but the expression is halting. Jerome, who translates valide, points to the correct thing, and Buxtorf (Lex. col. 2342f.) by interpreting the not less puzzling Targum translation in fundamento  equals  funditus or in essentia  equals  essentialiter, has, without intending it, hit upon the idea of the Hebr. Keri; &#1514;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; is intended as a closer defining, or adverbial, accusative: Thou causest me to vanish as to existence, ita ut tota essentia pereat h.e. totaliter et omnino. Perhaps this was really the meaning of the poet: most completely, most thoroughly, altogether, like the Arab. h&#803;aqqan. But it is unfavourable to this Keri, that &#1514;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1492; (from the verb &#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;), as might be expected, is always written plene elsewhere; the correction of the &#1514;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1492; is violent, and moreover this form, correctly read, gives a sense far more consistent with the figure, <a href="/job/30-22.htm">Job 30:22</a>. Ges., Umbr., and Carey falsely read &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492;, terres me; this verb is unknown in Hebr., and even in Chaldee is only used in Ithpeal, &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497; ( equals  Hebr. &#1495;&#1512;&#1491;); for a similar reason Bttcher's &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1492; (which is intended to mean: in despair) is also not to be used. Even Stuhlmann perceived that &#1514;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1492; is equivalent to &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1492;; it is, with Ew. and Olsh., to be read &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492; (not with Pareau and Hirz. &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1492; without the Dag.), and this form signifies, as &#1514;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1488;&#1492;, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/36-29.htm">Job 36:29</a>, from &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1488;  equals  &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1492;, from which it is derived by change of consonants, the crash of thunder, or even the rumbling or roar as of a storm or a falling in (procellae sive ruinae). The meaning is hardly, that he who rides away upon the stormy wind melts and trickles down like drops of rain among the pealing of the thunder, when the thunder-storm, whose harbinger is the stormy wind, gathers; but that in the storm itself, which increases in fury to the howling of a tempest, he dissolves away. &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492; for &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492;, comp. <a href="/psalms/107-26.htm">Psalm 107:26</a> : their soul melted away (dissolved) &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492;. The compulsory journey in the air, therefore, passes into nothing or nearly nothing, as Job is well aware, <a href="/job/30-23.htm">Job 30:23</a> : "for I:know: (without &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, as <a href="/job/19-25.htm">Job 19:25</a>; <a href="/psalms/9-21.htm">Psalm 9:21</a>) Thou wilt bring me back to death" (acc. of the goal, or locative without any sign). If &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497; is taken in its most natural signification reduces, death is represented as essentially one with the dust of death (comp. <a href="/job/1-21.htm">Job 1:21</a> with <a href="/genesis/3-19.htm">Genesis 3:19</a>), or even with non-existence, out of which man is come into being; nevertheless &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489; can also, by obliterating the notion of return, like redigere, have only the signification of the turn of destiny and change of condition that is effected. The assertion that &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; always includes an "again," and retains it inexorably (vid., Khler on <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/13-7.htm">Zechariah 13:7</a>, S. 239), is untenable. In post-biblical Hebrew, at least, it is certain that &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; signifies not only "to become again," but also "to become," as Arab. &#8219;a&#770;d is used as synon. of ja&#770;'in, devenir.<p>(Note: Vid., my Anekdota der mittelalterlichen Scholastik unter Juden und Moslemen, S. 347.)<p>With &#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, the designation of the condition, is coupled the designation of the place: Hades (under the notion of which that of the grave is included) is the great involuntary rendezvous of all who live in this world. </body></html>
