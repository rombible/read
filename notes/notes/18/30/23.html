Harbouring hard thoughts of God was the sin which did, at this time, most easily beset Job. When inward temptations join with outward calamities, the soul is hurried as in a tempest, and is filled with confusion. But woe be to those who really have God for an enemy! Compared with the awful state of ungodly men, what are all outward, or even inward temporal afflictions? There is something with which Job comforts himself, yet it is but a little. He foresees that death will be the end of all his troubles. God's wrath might bring him to death; but his soul would be safe and happy in the world of spirits. If none pity us, yet our God, who corrects, pities us, even as a father pitieth his own children. And let us look more to the things of eternity: then the believer will cease from mourning, and joyfully praise redeeming love.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For I know that thou wilt bring me to death - This is the language of despair. Occasionally Job seems to have had an assurance that his calamities would pass by, and that God would show himself to be his friend on earth (compare the notes at <a href="/job/19-25.htm">Job 19:25</a>), and at other times he utters the language of despair. Such would be commonly the case with a good man afflicted as he was, and agitated with alternate hopes and fears. We are not to set these expressions down as contradictions. All that inspiration is responsible for, is the fair record of his feelings; and that he should have alternate hopes and fears is in entire accordance with what occurs when we are afflicted. Here the view of his sorrows appears to have been so overwhelming, that he says he knew they must terminate in death. The phrase "to death" means to the house of the dead, or to the place where the dead are. Umbreit.<p>And to the house appointed for all living - The grave; compare <a href="/hebrews/9-27.htm">Hebrews 9:27</a>. That house or home is "appointed" for all. It is not a matter of chance that we come there, but it is because the Great Arbiter of life has so ordained. What an affecting consideration it should be, that such a house is designated for all! A house so dark, so gloomy, so solitary, so repulsive! For all that sit on thrones; for all that move in the halls of music and pleasure; for all that roll along in splendid carriages; for all the beautiful, the happy, the vigorous, the manly; for all in the marts of business, in the low scenes of dissipation, and in the sanctuary of God; for every one who is young, and every one who is aged, this is the home! Here they come at last; and here they lie down in the narrow bed! God's hand will bring them all there; and there will they lie until his voice summons them to judgment! <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/30.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>23.

Quickly and by the present affliction upon him; he was assured, as he thought, that this was the view and design of God in this providence, under which he was to bring him to death and the grave; that he would never take off his hand till he had brought him to the dust of death, to that lifeless dust from whence he had his original; otherwise, that he would he brought thither, sooner or later, was no great masterpiece of knowledge; every man knows this will be the case with him as with all; death is become necessary by sin, which brought it into the world, and the sentence of it on all men in it, and by the decree and appointment of God, by which it is fixed and settled that all should die; and this is confirmed by all experience in all ages, a very few excepted, only two persons, Enoch and Elijah, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/5-24.htm">Genesis 5:24</a>, sometimes the death of persons is made known to them by divine revelation, as to Aaron and Moses, <a href="/numbers/20-12.htm">Numbers 20:12</a>; and sometimes it may be gathered to be nigh from the symptoms of it on the body; from growing diseases, and the infirmities of old age; but Job concluded it from the manner of God's dealing with him, as he thought in wrath and indignation, determining to make an utter end of him: <p>and to the house appointed for all living; the grave, which is the house for the body when dead to be brought unto and lodged in; as the "house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens", <a href="//biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-1.htm">2 Corinthians 5:1</a>, is for the soul in its separate state, until the resurrection morn; which house or grave is man's "long home", <a href="/ecclesiastes/12-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:5</a>; and this is prepared and appointed for all men living, since all must die; and all that die have a house or grave, though that is sometimes a watery, and not an earthy one; however the dust of everybody has a receptacle provided for it, where it is reserved until the time of the resurrection, and then it is brought forth, <a href="/revelation/20-13.htm">Revelation 20:13</a>; and this is by divine appointment; the word used signifies both an appointed time and place, and is often used of the Jewish solemnities, which were fixed with respect to both; and also of the people or congregation that attended them; the grave is the general rendezvous of mankind, and both the time when and the place where the dead are gathered and brought unto it are fixed by the determinate will and counsel of God. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/30.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For I know that thou wilt bring me to death, and to the house appointed for all living.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/job/30.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">23</span>.

Job has all along expressed his conviction that he has nothing to look for but death. He feels within himself the seeds of a mortal malady; for such, practically, was elephantiasis in Job's time. He  is devoid of any expectation of recovery. Death must come upon him, he thinks, ere long; and then God will bring him to the house appointed for all living. This, as he has already explained (<a href="/job/10-21.htm">Job 10:21, 22</a>), is "the land of darkness and the shadow of death, a land of darkness, as darkness itself; and of the shadow of death, without any order, and where the light is as darkness." It is a melancholy prospect; but we must regard it as cheered by the hope of an ultimate resurrection, such as seems indicated, if not absolutely proclaimed, in <a href="/job/19-25.htm">Job 19:25-27</a> (see the comment on that passage). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/30.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>16  And now my soul is poured out within me,<p>Days of suffering hold me fast.<p>17  The night rendeth my bones from me,<p>And my gnawers sleep not.<p>18  By great force my garment is distorted,<p>As the collar of my shirt it encompasseth me.<p>19  He hath cast me into the mire,<p>And I am in appearance as dust and ashes.<p>With this third &#1493;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; (<a href="//biblehub.com/job/30-1.htm">Job 30:1</a>, <a href="/job/30-9.htm">Job 30:9</a>) the elegiac lament over the harsh contrast between the present and the past begins for the third time. The dash after our translation of the second and fourth strophes will indicate that a division of the elegy ends there, after which it begins as it were anew. The soul is poured out within a man (&#1506;&#1500;&#1497; as <a href="//biblehub.com/job/10-1.htm">Job 10:1</a>, Psychol. S. 152), when, "yielding itself without resistance to sadness, it is dejected to the very bottom, and all its organization flows together, and it is dissolved in the one condition of sorrow" - a figure which is not, however, come about by water being regarded as the symbol of the soul (thus Hitzig on <a href="/psalms/42-5.htm">Psalm 42:5</a>), but rather by the intimate resemblance of the representation of a flood of tears (<a href="/lamentations/2-19.htm">Lamentations 2:19</a>): the life of the soul flows in the blood, and the anguish of the soul in tears and lamentations; and since the outward man is as it were dissolved in the gently flowing tears (<a href="/isaiah/15-3.htm">Isaiah 15:3</a>), his soul flows away as it were in itself, for the outward incident is but the manifestation and result of an inward action. &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1470;&#1506;&#1504;&#1497; we have translated days of suffering, for &#1506;&#1504;&#1497;, with its verb and the rest of its derivatives, is the proper word for suffering, and especially the passion of the Servant of Jehovah. Days of suffering - Job complains - hold him fast; &#1506;&#1495;&#1494; unites in itself, like &#1492;&#1495;&#1494;&#1497;&#1511;, the significations prehendere and prehensum tenere. In <a href="/job/30-17.htm">Job 30:17</a> we must not, with Arnh. and others, translate: by night it (affliction) pierces ... , for &#1506;&#1504;&#1497; does not stand sufficiently in the foreground to be the subject of what follows; it might sooner be rendered: by night it is pierced through (Targ., Rosenm., Hahn); but why is not &#1500;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492; to be the subject, and &#1504;&#1511;&#1468;&#1512; consequently Piel (not Niph.)? The night has been personified already, <a href="/job/3-2.htm">Job 3:2</a>; and in general, as Herder once said, Job is the brother of Ossian for personifications: Night (the restless night, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/7-3.htm">Job 7:3</a>, in which every malady, or at least the painful feeling of it, increases) pierces his bones from him, i.e., roots out his limbs (synon. &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="/job/18-13.htm">Job 18:13</a>) so inwardly and completely. The lepra Arabica (Arab. 'l-brs&#803;, el-baras) terminates, like syphilis, with an eating away of the limbs, and the disease has its name Arab. jud&#817;a&#770;m from jd&#817;m, truncare, mutilare: it feeds on the bones, and destroys the body in such a manner that single limbs are completely detached.<p>In <a href="//biblehub.com/job/30-17.htm">Job 30:17</a>, lxx (&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;), Parchon, Kimchi, and others translate &#1506;&#1512;&#1511;&#1497; according to the Targum. &#1506;&#1512;&#1511;&#1497;&#1503; ( equals  &#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;), and the Arab. &#8219;ru&#770;q, veins, after which Blumenf.: my veins are in constant motion. But &#1506;&#1512;&#1511;&#1497; in the sense of <a href="/job/30-3.htm">Job 30:3</a> : my gnawers (Jer. qui me comedunt, Targ. &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1506;&#1505;&#1468;&#1503; &#1497;&#1514;&#1497;, qui me conculcant, conterunt), is far more in accordance with the predicate and the parallelism, whether it be gnawing pains that are thought of - pains are unnatural to man, they come upon him against his will, he separates them from himself as wild beasts - or, which we prefer, those worms (&#1512;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;, <a href="/job/7-5.htm">Job 7:5</a>) which were formed in Job's ulcers (comp. Aruch, &#1506;&#1512;&#1511;&#1488;, a leech, plur. &#1506;&#1512;&#1511;&#1514;&#1488;, worms, e.g., in the liver), and which in the extra-biblical tradition of Job's decease are such a standing feature, that the pilgrims to Job's monastery even now-a-days take away with them thence these supposedly petrified worms of Job.<p>(Note: In Mugir ed-dn's large history of Jerusalem and Hebron (kita&#770;b el-ins el-gel&#305;&#770;l), in an article on Job, we read: God had so visited him in his body, that he got the disease that devours the limbs (tegedhdhem), and worms were produced (dawwad) in the wounds, while he lay on a dunghill (mezbele), and except his wife, who tended him, no one ventured to come too near him. In a beautiful Kurdic ballad "on the basket dealer" (zembilfrosh), which I have obtained from the Kurds in Salihje, are these words:<p>Veki Gergis beshara beri<p>Jusuf veki abdan keri<p>Bikesr' Ejub kurman deri<p>continued...</body></html>
