Harbouring hard thoughts of God was the sin which did, at this time, most easily beset Job. When inward temptations join with outward calamities, the soul is hurried as in a tempest, and is filled with confusion. But woe be to those who really have God for an enemy! Compared with the awful state of ungodly men, what are all outward, or even inward temporal afflictions? There is something with which Job comforts himself, yet it is but a little. He foresees that death will be the end of all his troubles. God's wrath might bring him to death; but his soul would be safe and happy in the world of spirits. If none pity us, yet our God, who corrects, pities us, even as a father pitieth his own children. And let us look more to the things of eternity: then the believer will cease from mourning, and joyfully praise redeeming love.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>My harp also is turned to mourning - What formerly gave cheerful sounds, now gives only notes of plaintiveness and lamentation. The harp was probably an instrument originally designed to give sounds of joy.

The word &#1506;&#1490;&#1489;  &#8219;u&#770;ga&#770;b is doubtless from &#1506;&#1490;&#1489;  &#8219;a&#770;gab, "to breathe, to blow"; and most probably the instrument hero intended was the pipe. For a description of it, see the notes at <a href="/isaiah/5-12.htm">Isaiah 5:12</a>. This instrument, also, was played, as would appear, on joyous occasions, but Job now says that it was turned to grief. All that had been joyous with him had fled. His honor was taken away; his friends were gone; they who had treated him with reverence now stood at a distance, or treated him with contempt; his health was departed, and his former appearance, indicating a station of affluence, was changed for the dark complexion produced by disease, and the instruments of joyousness now gave forth only notes of sorrow. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/30.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>31. organ&#8212;rather, "pipe" (Job 21:12).
