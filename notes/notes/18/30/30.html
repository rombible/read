Harbouring hard thoughts of God was the sin which did, at this time, most easily beset Job. When inward temptations join with outward calamities, the soul is hurried as in a tempest, and is filled with confusion. But woe be to those who really have God for an enemy! Compared with the awful state of ungodly men, what are all outward, or even inward temporal afflictions? There is something with which Job comforts himself, yet it is but a little. He foresees that death will be the end of all his troubles. God's wrath might bring him to death; but his soul would be safe and happy in the world of spirits. If none pity us, yet our God, who corrects, pities us, even as a father pitieth his own children.

The "burning pains" in the bones, which characterize at least one form of elephantiasis, have been already mentioned (see the comment on ver. 17).

The translation of the Targum follows the fancies of the Midrash, and places itself beyond the range of criticism. The lxx reads &#1489;&#1497; instead of &#1489;&#1506;&#1497;, and finds in <a href="/job/30-24.htm">Job 30:24</a> a longing for suicide, or death by the hand of another. The Syriac likewise reads &#1489;&#1497;, although it avoids this absurdity. Jerome makes an address of the assertion, and, moreover, also moulds the text under the influence of the Midrash. Aq., Symm., and Theod. strive after a better rendering than the lxx, but (to judge from the fragment in the Hexapla) without success. Saadia and Gecatilia wring a sense out of <a href="//biblehub.com/job/30-24.htm">Job 30:24</a>, but at the expense of the syntax, and by dragging <a href="/job/30-24.htm">Job 30:24</a> after it, contrary to the tenor of the words. The old expositors also advance nothing available. They mostly interpret it as though it were not &#1500;&#1492;&#1503;, but &#1500;&#1492;&#1501; (a reading which has been forced into the Midrash texts and some Codd. instead of the reading of the text that is handed down to us). Even Rosenm. thinks &#1500;&#1492;&#1503; might, like the Ara. &#1500;&#1492;&#1493;&#1503;, be equivalent to &#1500;&#1492;&#1501;; and Carey explains the enallage generis from the perhaps existing secondary idea of womanly fear, as <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/4-6.htm">2 Samuel 4:6</a>, &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; instead of &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; is used of the two assassins to describe them as cowards. But the Hebr. &#1500;&#1492;&#1503; is fem.; and often as the enallage masc. pro fem. occurs, the enallage fem. pro masc. is unknown; &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/4-6.htm">2 Samuel 4:6</a>, is an adv. of place (vid., moreover, Thenius in loc.). It is just as absolutely inadmissible when the old expositors combine &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506; with &#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; (&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;), or as e.g., Raschi with &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;, and translate, "welfare" or "exhilaration" (refreshing). The signif. "wealth" would be more readily admissible, so that &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;, as Aben-Ezra observes, would be the subst. to &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1506;, <a href="/job/34-19.htm">Job 34:19</a>; but in <a href="/job/36-19.htm">Job 36:19</a> (which see), &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506; (as &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1506; <a href="/isaiah/22-5.htm">Isaiah 22:5</a>) signifies a cry of distress ( equals  &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1506;), and an attempt must be made here with this meaning before every other.<p>On the other hand comes the question whether &#1489;&#1506;&#1497; is not perhaps to be referred to the verb &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492;, whether it be as subst. after the form &#1502;&#1512;&#1497; (Ralbag after the Targ.) or as part. pass. (Saad. Arab. g&#305;&#770;r &#8219;nnh l&#305;&#770;s 'l-mbtgan, "only that it is not desired"). The verb does not, indeed, occur elsewhere in the book of Job, but is very consistent with its style, which so abounds in Aramaisms, and is at the same time so coloured with Arabic that we should almost say, its Hauranitish style.<p>(Note: The Arab. verb bg' is still extensively used in Syria, and that in two forms: Arab. bg' ybgy and bg' ybg'. In Damascus the fut. i is alone used; whereas in Hauran and the steppe I have only found fut. a. Thus e.g., the Hauranite poet Ksim el-Chinn says: "The gracious God encompass thee with His favour and whatever thy soul desires (wa-l-nefsu ma tebgha&#770;), it must obtain its desire" (tanu&#770;lu muna&#770;hu&#770;, in connection with which it is to be observed that Arab. ba&#770;l, fut. u is used here in the signification adipisci, comp. Fleischer on <a href="/job/15-29.htm">Job 15:29</a> [supra i. 270, note]). - Wetzst.)<p>Thus taking &#1489;&#1506;&#1497; as one word, Ralbag transl.: prayer stretched not forth the hand, which is intended to mean: is not able to do anything, cannot cause the will of God to miscarry. This meaning is only obtained by great violence; but when Renan (together with Bckel and Carey, after Rosenm.) translates: Vaines prires!..il tend sa main;  quoi bon protester contre ses coups? the one may be measured with the other. If &#1489;&#1506;&#1497; is to be derived from &#1489;&#1506;&#1497;, it must be translated either: shall He, however, without prayer (sine imploratione), or: shall He, however, unimplored (non imploratus), stretch out His hand? The thought remains the same by both renderings of &#1489;&#1506;&#1497;, and suits as a vindication of the cry for help in the context. But &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492;, in the specific signification implorare, deprecari, is indeed the usage of the Targum, although strange to the Hebr., which is here so rich in synonyms; then, in the former case, &#1500;&#1488; for &#1489;&#1500;&#1488; is harsh, and in the other, &#1489;&#1506;&#1497; as part. pass. is too strong an Aramaism. We must therefore consider whether &#1489;&#1506;&#1497; as &#1506;&#1497; with the praep. &#1489;&#1468; gives a suitable sense. Since &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495; &#1497;&#1491; &#1489;&#1468;, e.g., <a href="/job/28-9.htm">Job 28:9</a> and elsewhere, most commonly means "to lay the hand on anything, stretch out the hand to anything," it is most natural to take &#1489;&#1506;&#1497; in dependence upon &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495; &#1497;&#1491;&#1493;, and we really gain an impressive thought, if we translate: Only may He not stretch out His hand (to continue His work of destruction) to a heap of rubbish (which I am already become); but by this translation of <a href="//biblehub.com/job/30-24.htm">Job 30:24</a>, <a href="/job/30-24.htm">Job 30:24</a> remains a glaring puzzle, insoluble in itself and in respect of the further course of the thought, for Schlottmann's interpretation, "Only one does not touch ruins, or the ruin of one is the salvation of another," which is itself puzzling, is no solution. The reproach against the friends which is said to lie in <a href="/job/30-24.htm">Job 30:24</a> is contrary to the character of this monologue, which is turned away from his human opponents; then &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506; does not signify salvation, and there is no "one" and "another" to be found in the text. We must therefore, against our inclination, give up this dependent relation of &#1489;&#1506;&#1497;, so that &#1489;&#1506;&#1497; signifies either, upon a heap of rubbish, or, since this ought to be &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1506;&#1497;: by the falling in; &#1506;&#1497; (from &#1506;&#1493;&#1492;  equals  &#8219;iwj) can mean both: a falling in or overthrow (bouleversement) as an event, and ruins or rubbish as its result.<p>Accordingly Hirz. translates: Only upon the ruins (more correctly at least: upon ruins) one will not stretch out his hand, and Ew.: Only - does not one stretch out one's hand by one's overthrow? But this "only" is awkward. Hahn is of opinion that &#1488;&#1498; &#1500;&#1488; may be taken in the signification not once, and translates: may one not for once raise one's hand by one's downfall; but even this is lame, because then all connection with what precedes is wanting; besides, &#1488;&#1498; &#1500;&#1488; does not signify ne quidem. The originally affirmative &#1488;&#1498; has certainly for the most part a restrictive signification, which, as we observed on <a href="//biblehub.com/job/18-21.htm">Job 18:21</a>, is blended with the affirmative in Hebr., but it is also, as more frequently &#1488;&#1499;&#1503;, used adversatively, e.g., <a href="//biblehub.com/job/16-7.htm">Job 16:7</a>, and in the combination &#1488;&#1498; &#1500;&#1488; this adversative signification coincides with the restrictive, for this double particle signifies everywhere else: only not, however not, <a href="/genesis/20-12.htm">Genesis 20:12</a>; <a href="/1_kings/11-39.htm">1 Kings 11:39</a>; <a href="/2_kings/12-14.htm">2 Kings 12:14</a>; <a href="/2_kings/13-6.htm">2 Kings 13:6</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/23-9.htm">2 Kings 23:9</a>, <a href="/2_kings/23-26.htm">2 Kings 23:26</a>. It would be more natural to translate, as we have stated above: only may be not, etc., but <a href="/job/30-24.htm">Job 30:24</a> puts in its veto against this. If, as Hirz., Ew., and Hahn also suppose, &#1500;&#1488;, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/30-24.htm">Job 30:24</a>, is equivalent to &#1492;&#1500;&#1488;, so that the sentence is to be spoken with an interrogative accent, we must translate &#1488;&#1498; as Jer. has done, by verumtamen. He knows that he is being hurried forth to meet death; he knows it, and has also already made himself so familiar with this thought, that the sooner he sees an end put to this his sorrowful life the better - nevertheless does one not stretch out one's hand when one is falling? This involuntary reaction against destruction is the inevitable result of man's instinct of self-preservation. It needs no proof that &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495; &#1497;&#1491; can signify "to stretch out one's hand for help;" &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495; is used with a general subj.: one stretches out, as <a href="/job/17-5.htm">Job 17:5</a>; <a href="/job/21-22.htm">Job 21:22</a>. With this determination of the idea of <a href="//biblehub.com/job/30-24.htm">Job 30:24</a>, <a href="/job/30-24.htm">Job 30:24</a> is now also naturally connected with what precedes. It is not, however, to be translated, as Ew. and Hirz.: if one is in distress, is not a cry for help heard on account of it? If &#1488;&#1501; were intended hypothetically, a continuation of the power of the interrogative &#1500;&#1488; from <a href="/job/30-24.htm">Job 30:24</a> would be altogether impossible. Hahn and Loch-Reischl rightly take &#1488;&#1501; in the sense of an. It introduces another turn of the question: Does one, however, not stretch out one's hand to hasten the fall, or in his downfall (raise) a cry for help, or a wail, on that account? Dderlein's conjecture, &#1500;&#1495;&#1503; for &#1500;&#1492;&#1503; (praying "for favour"), deserves respectful mention, but it is not needed: &#1500;&#1492;&#1503; signifies neutrally: in (under) such circumstances (comp. &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1501;, <a href="/job/22-21.htm">Job 22:21</a>; <a href="/isaiah/64-5.htm">Isaiah 64:5</a>), or is directly equivalent to &#1500;&#1492;&#1503;, which (<a href="/ruth/1-13.htm">Ruth 1:13</a>) signifies propterea, and even in biblical Chaldee, beside the Chaldee signif. sed, nisi, retains this Hebrew signif. (<a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/2-6.htm">Daniel 2:6</a>, <a href="/daniel/2-9.htm">Daniel 2:9</a>; <a href="/daniel/4-24.htm">Daniel 4:24</a>). &#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491;, which signifies dying and destruction (Talmud. in the peculiar signif.: that which is hewn or pecked open), synon. of &#1488;&#1497;&#1491;, has been already discussed on <a href="/job/12-5.htm">Job 12:5</a>.</body></html>
