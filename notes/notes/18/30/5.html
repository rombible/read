Weak races retreat before strong ones, who occupy their lands, and whose will they do not dare to dispute. They are not intentionally "driven out," for the strong raecs would gladly make them their drudges; but they retire into the most inaccessible regions, as the primitive population has done in India and elsewhere. They cried after them as after a thief. Outcast tribes naturally, and almost necessarily, become robber-tribes. Deprived of their productive lands, and driven into rocky deserts, want makes them thieves and marauders. Then those who have made them what they are vilify and decry them. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/29.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>21  They hearkened to me and waited,<p>And remained silent at my decision.<p>22  After my utterance they spake not again,<p>And my speech distilled upon them.<p>23  And they waited for me as for the rain,<p>And they opened their mouth wide for the latter rain.<p>24  I smiled to them in their hopelessness,<p>And the light of my countenance they cast not down.<p>25  I chose the way for them, and sat as chief,<p>And dwelt as a king in the army,<p>As one that comforteth the mourners.<p>Attentive, patient, and ready to be instructed, they hearkened to him (this is the force of &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; &#1500;), and waited, without interrupting, for what he should say. &#1493;&#1497;&#1495;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, the pausal pronunciation with a reduplication of the last radical, as <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/5-7.htm">Judges 5:7</a>, &#1495;&#1491;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; (according to correct texts), Ges. 20, 2, c; the reading of Kimchi, &#1493;&#1497;&#1495;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;, is the reading of Ben-Naphtali, the former the reading of Ben-Ascher (vid., Norzi). If he gave counsel, they waited in strictest silence: this is the meaning of &#1497;&#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468; (fut. Kal of &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1501;); &#1500;&#1502;&#1493;, poetic for &#1500;, refers the silence to its outward cause (vid., on <a href="/habakkuk/3-16.htm">Habakkuk 3:16</a>). After his words non iterabant, i.e., as Jerome explanatorily translates: addere nihil audebant, and his speech came down upon them relieving, rejoicing, and enlivening them. The figure indicated in &#1514;&#1468;&#1496;&#1468;&#1507; is expanded in <a href="/job/29-23.htm">Job 29:23</a> after <a href="/deuteronomy/32-2.htm">Deuteronomy 32:2</a> : they waited on his word, which penetrated deeply, even to the heart, as for rain, &#1502;&#1496;&#1512;, by which, as <a href="//biblehub.com/job/29-23.htm">Job 29:23</a>, the so-called (autumnal) early rain which moistens the seed is prominently thought of. They open their mouth for the late rain, &#1502;&#1500;&#1511;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473; (vid., on <a href="/job/24-6.htm">Job 24:6</a>), i.e., they thirsted after his words, which were like the March or April rain, which helps to bring to maturity the corn that is soon to be reaped; this rain frequently fails, and is therefore the more longed for. &#1508;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512; &#1508;&#1468;&#1492; is to be understood according to <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/119-131.htm">Psalm 119:131</a>, comp. <a href="/psalms/81-11.htm">Psalm 81:11</a>; and one must consider, in connection with it, what raptures the beginning of the periodical rains produces everywhere, where, as e.g., in Jerusalem, the people have been obliged for some time to content themselves with cisterns that are almost dried to a marsh, and how the old and young dance for joy at their arrival!<p>In <a href="/job/29-24.htm">Job 29:24</a> a thought as suited to the syntax as to the fact is gained if we translate: "I smiled to them - they believed it not," i.e., they considered such condescension as scarcely possible (Saad., Raschi, Rosenm., De Wette, Schlottm., and others); &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1495;&#1511; is then fut. hypotheticum, as <a href="/job/10-16.htm">Job 10:16</a>; <a href="/job/20-24.htm">Job 20:24</a>; <a href="/job/22-27.htm">Job 22:27</a>., Ew. 357, b. But it does not succeed in putting <a href="/job/29-24.htm">Job 29:24</a> in a consistent relation to this thought; for, with Aben-Ezra, to explain: they did not esteem my favour the less on that account, my respect suffered thereby no loss among them, is not possible in connection with the biblical idea of "the light of the countenance;" and with Schlottm. to explain: they let not the light of my countenance, i.e., token of my favour, fall away, i.e., be in vain, is contrary to the usage of the language, according to which &#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500; &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; signifies: to cause the countenance to sink (gloomily, <a href="/genesis/4-5.htm">Genesis 4:5</a>), whether one's own, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-12.htm">Jeremiah 3:12</a>, or that of another. Instead of &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; we have a more pictorial and poetical expression here, &#1488;&#1493;&#1512; &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;: light of my countenance, i.e., my cheerfulness (as <a href="/proverbs/16-15.htm">Proverbs 16:15</a>). Moreover, the &#1488;&#1513;&#1474;&#1495;&#1511; &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;, therefore, furnishes the thought that he laughed, and did not allow anything to dispossess him of his easy and contented disposition. Thus, therefore, those to whom Job laughed are to be thought of as in a condition and mood which his cheerfulness might easily sadden, but still did not sadden; and this their condition is described by &#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1488;&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; (a various reading in Codd. and editions is &#1493;&#1500;&#1488;), a phrase which occurred before (<a href="/job/24-22.htm">Job 24:22</a>) in the signification of being without faith or hope, despairing (comp. &#1492;&#1488;&#1502;&#1497;&#1503;, to gain faith, <a href="/psalms/116-10.htm">Psalm 116:10</a>), - a clause which is not to be taken as attributive (Umbr., Vaih.: who had not confidence), but as a neutral or circumstantial subordinate clause (Ew. 341, a). Therefore translate: I smiled to them, if they believed not, i.e., despaired; and however despondent their position appeared, the cheerfulness of my countenance they could not cause to pass away. However gloomy they were, they could not make me gloomy and off my guard. Thus also <a href="/job/29-25.htm">Job 29:25</a> is now suitably attached to the preceding: I chose their way, i.e., I made the way plain, which they should take in order to get out of their hopeless and miserable state, and sat as chief, as a king who is surrounded by an armed host as a defence and as a guard of honour, attentive to the motion of his eye; not, however, as a sovereign ruler, but as one who condescended to the mourners, and comforted them (&#1504;&#1495;&#1501; Piel, properly to cause to breathe freely). This peaceful figure of a king brings to mind the warlike one, <a href="/job/15-24.htm">Job 15:24</a>. &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; is not a conj. here, but equivalent to &#1499;&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, ut (quis) qui; consequently not: as one comforts, but: as he who comforts; lxx correctly: &#x3bf;&#788;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;. The accentuation (&#1499;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; Tarcha, &#1488;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; Munach, &#1497;&#1504;&#1495;&#1501; Silluk) is erroneous; &#1499;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; should be marked with Rebia mugrasch, and &#1488;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; with Mercha-Zinnorith.<p>From the prosperous and happy past, absolutely passed, Job now turns to the present, which contrasts so harshly with it. </body></html>
