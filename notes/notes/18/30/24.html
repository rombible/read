Harbouring hard thoughts of God was the sin which did, at this time, most easily beset Job. When inward temptations join with outward calamities, the soul is hurried as in a tempest, and is filled with confusion. But woe be to those who really have God for an enemy! Compared with the awful state of ungodly men, what are all outward, or even inward temporal afflictions? There is something with which Job comforts himself, yet it is but a little. He foresees that death will be the end of all his troubles. God's wrath might bring him to death; but his soul would be safe and happy in the world of spirits. If none pity us, yet our God, who corrects, pities us, even as a father pitieth his own children. And let us look more to the things of eternity: then the believer will cease from mourning, and joyfully praise redeeming love.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Howbeit he will not stretch out his hand to the grave - Margin, heap. In our common version this verse conveys no very clear idea, and it is quite evident that our translators despaired of giving it a consistent sense, and attempted merely to translate it literally. The verse has been rendered by every expositor almost in his own way; and though almost no two of them agree, yet it is remarkable that the versions given are all beautiful, and furnish a sense that agrees well with the scope of the passage. The Vulgate renders it, "But not to their consumption wilt thou send forth their hand; and if they fall, thou wilt save them." The Septuagint," For O that I could lay violent hands on myself, or beseech another, and he would do it for me Luther renders it, "Yet he shall not stretch out the hand to the charnelhouse, and they shall not cry before his destruction." Noyes:<p>"When he stretcheth out his hand, prayer<p>availeth nothing,<p>When he bringeth destruction, vain is the<p>Cry for help."<p>Umbreit renders it:<p>Nur mog' er nicht an den zerstorten HaufenHand anlegen!<p>Oder mussen jene selbst in ihremTode schreien?<p>"Only if he would not lay his hand upon theHeaps of the destroyed!<p>Or must these also cry out in their death?"<p>According to this interpretation, Job speaks here in bitter irony. "I would gladly die," says he, "if God would only suffer me to be quiet when I am dead." He would be willing that the edifice of the body should be taken down, provided the ruins might rest in peace. Rosenmuller gives the same sense as that expressed by Noyes. Amidst this variety of interpretation, it is by no means easy to determine on the true meaning of the passage. The principal difficulty in the exposition lies in the word &#1489;&#1506;&#1497;  be&#8219;&#305;&#770;y, rendered in the text "in the grave," and in the margin "heap." If that word is compounded of the preposition &#1489;  be and &#1506;&#1497;  &#8219;&#305;&#770;y, it means literally, "in ruins, or in rubbish" - for so the word &#1506;&#1497;  &#8219;&#305;&#770;y is used in <a href="/micah/1-6.htm">Micah 1:6</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/26-18.htm">Jeremiah 26:18</a>; <a href="/micah/3-12.htm">Micah 3:12</a>; <a href="/psalms/79-1.htm">Psalm 79:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-2.htm">Nehemiah 4:2</a>, <a href="/nehemiah/4-10.htm">Nehemiah 4:10</a>. But Gesenius supposes it to be a single word, from the obsolete root &#1489;&#1506;&#1492;, Chaldee &#1489;&#1506;&#1488;, "to pray, to petition"; and according to this the meaning is, "Yea, prayer is nought when he stretches out his hand; and in his (God's) destruction, their cry availeth not."<p>Prof. Lee understands the word (&#1489;&#1506;&#1497;  be&#8219;&#305;&#770;y) in the same sense, but gives a somewhat different meaning to the whole passage. According to him the meaning is, "Nevertheless, upon prayer thou wilt not lay thine hand; surely, when he destroyeth, in this alone there is safety." Schultens accords very nearly in the sentiment expressed by Umbreit, and renders it, "Yet not even in the tomb would he relax his hand, if in its destruction an alleviation were there." This sentiment is very strong, and borders on impiety, and should not be adopted if it is possible to avoid it. It looks as if Job felt that God was disposed to pursue his animosity even into the regions of the dead, and that he would have pleasure in carrying on the work of destruction and affliction in the ruins of the grave. After the most careful examination which I have been able to give of this difficult passage, it seems probable to me that the following is the correct sense.<p>Job means to state a general and important principle - that there was rest in the grave. He said he knew that God would bring him down there, but that would be a state of repose. The hand of God producing pain, would not reach there, nor would the sorrows experienced in this world be felt there, provided there had been a praying life. Notwithstanding all his afflictions, therefore, and his certain conviction that he would die, he had unwavering confidence in God. Agreeably to this, the following paraphrase will convey the true sense. "I know that he will bring me to the grave. Nevertheless (&#1488;&#1498;  'ak), over the ruins (&#1489;&#1506;&#1497;  be&#8219;&#305;&#770;y) - of my body, the ruins in the grave - "he will not stretch out his hand" - to afflict me there or to pursue those who lie there with calamity and judgment; if in his destruction (&#1489;&#1508;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;  bep&#305;&#770;ydo&#770;) - in the destruction or desolation which God brings upon people - among them (&#1500;&#1492;&#1503;  la&#770;he&#770;n) - among those who are thus consigned to the ruins of the grave - there is prayer (&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1506;  shu&#770;a&#8219;); if there has been supplication offered to him, or a cry for mercy has gone up before him." This paraphrase embraces every word of the original; saves the necessity of attempting to change the text, as has been often done, and gives a meaning which accords with the scope of the passage, and with the uniform belief of Job, that God would ultimately vindicate him, and show that he himself was right in his government. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/30.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24. Expressing Job's faith as to the state after death. Though one must go to the grave, yet He will no more afflict in the ruin of the body (so Hebrew for "grave") there, if one has cried to Him when being destroyed. The "stretching of His hand" to punish after death answers antithetically to the raising "the cry" of prayer in the second clause. Maurer gives another translation which accords with the scope of Job 30:24-31; if it be natural for one in affliction to ask aid, why should it be considered (by the friends) wrong in my case? "Nevertheless does not a man in ruin stretch out his hand" (imploring help, Job 30:20; La 1:17)? If one be in his calamity (destruction) is there not therefore a "cry" (for aid)? Thus in the parallelism "cry" answers to "stretch&#8212;hand"; "in his calamity," to "in ruin." The negative of the first clause is to be supplied in the second, as in Job 30:25 (Job 28:17).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/job/30.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> There is great variety and difficulty in the sense and connexion of these words. They may be joined either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. With the following verse, as describing Job’s compassion to others in affliction, which by the principles of reason and religion should have procured him some pity from God and men in his affliction. And to that purpose the words are or may be translated thus: <span class="ital">But was not</span> my <span class="ital">prayers</span> for them (which words may be understood out of the following clause) <span class="ital">when he stretched out his hand</span>? (to wit, against them to destroy them;) <span class="ital">in his destruction or oppression</span> (understand it actively, i.e. when God was about to destroy any other man or men) was not (the negation being understood out of the former branch of the verse, as is usual) my <span class="ital">cry for them</span>? the feminine-gender being put for the masculine, as it is elsewhere; or <span class="ital">for these things</span>, the feminine being put for the neuter; that is, for those destructive calamities which were upon them. Or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. With the foregoing verse. And so these words contain either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. A consolation against the evil last mentioned: so the sense is, Though God will undoubtedly bring me to the grave by these torments, yet this comforts me, that <span class="ital">surely he will not stretch out his hand</span> (to wit, to afflict or punish me further, as this phrase is used, <span class="bld"><a href="/exodus/3-20.htm" title="And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the middle thereof: and after that he will let you go.">Exodus 3:20</a> <a href="/isaiah/9-12.htm" title="The Syrians before, and the Philistines behind; and they shall devour Israel with open mouth. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.">Isaiah 9:12</a>,13</span>) <span class="ital">in the grave</span>, <span class="ital">though they</span>, i.e. the perishing persons, <span class="ital">cry</span> or <span class="ital">roar</span> (i.e. be sorely pained and tormented) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">in his destruction, </span> i.e. whilst God is destroying them. Or this last clause may be read interrogatively, <span class="ital">Is there any cry in his destruction</span>? When a man is cut off or destroyed by death, doth he then cry and complain? No, there is an end of all these miseries. Or rather, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. A confirmation of what he last said. For the whole context shows that Job is not taking any comfort to himself, but rather aggravating his sufferings. I know, saith he, that I am a dead man, and my condition is desperate, for <span class="ital">surely he</span>, i.e. God, will <span class="ital">not stretch</span> out his hand (to wit, to save or rescue me, as this phrase is used, <span class="bld"><a href="/psalms/18-17.htm" title="He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them which hated me: for they were too strong for me.">Psalm 18:17</a> 144:7</span>, compared with <span class="bld"><a href="/acts/4-30.htm" title="By stretching forth your hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of your holy child Jesus.">Acts 4:30</a></span>) <span class="ital">to</span> or <span class="ital">in the grave</span>, (i.e. to a dead man, such as I am in effect, having not only one foot, but in a manner both feet, in the grave, as being upon the very brink of the pit,)<span class="ital"> though they cry</span> (to wit, unto God, i.e. though there be a great and a general cry and lamentation for him among his friends, or others, and an earnest desire of him, if possibly he might be restored to life again) in his destruction, i.e. when he is destroyed or dead; yet all these cries would be in vain. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/job/30.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Howbeit he will not stretch out his hand to the grave,.... Or, "verily" (h), truly he will not, &amp;c. I am well assured he never will, meaning either he never would stretch out his hand to shut up the grave; or rather keep it shut, and prevent Job from going down into it; or to open it, and fetch him out of it when in it: God is indeed able to do either of these, and has done it; sometimes, when persons are brought as it were to the gates of death and the grave, he says to them, Return; yea, when they are brought to the dust of death, he prevents them going into the grave, by restoring them to life before carried thither, as the Shunammite's son, <a href="/2_kings/4-32.htm">2 Kings 4:32</a>; Jairus's daughter, <a href="/mark/5-41.htm">Mark 5:41</a>; and the widow's son of Nain, even when he was carrying to his grave, <a href="/luke/7-12.htm">Luke 7:12</a>; some have been laid in the grave, and God has stretched out his hand, and raised them up again; as the man that was laid in Elisha's grave, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/13-21.htm">2 Kings 13:21</a>, and Lazarus after he had lain in the grave some days, <a href="/john/11-39.htm">John 11:39</a>; but such things are not usually done; in common, when a man dies, and is laid in the grave, he rises not again, till the heavens be no more; and this Job was persuaded would be his case: <p>though they cry in his destruction; that is, though the friends and relations of the sick person, or the poor that he has been kind and bountiful unto, should cry unto God, while he is destroying him by the diseases upon him, and which threaten him with destruction, that he would spare his useful and valuable life; yet he is inexorable, and will not hear, but go on with what he intends to do, and takes him off by death, and lays him in the grave, "the pit of destruction", <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/55-23.htm">Psalm 55:23</a>, so called because it wastes and consumes bodies laid in it; and when once laid there, all cries for a restoration to life again are vain and fruitless. Some take these words as expressed in a way of solace, as if Job comforted himself with this thought under his present afflictions, that, when once he was brought to death and the grave, there would be an end of all his sorrow; the hand of the Lord, that was now stretched out on him in a terrible way, would be no longer stretched out on him; he would then cease to afflict him, and he should be where the weary are at rest; and so the last clause is read with an interrogation, "is there any cry", or "do any cry, in his destruction?" (i); no, when death has done its office, and the body is laid in the grave, there is no more pain nor sorrow, nor crying; all tears are wiped away, and there is no more sense of afflictions and sufferings; they are all at an end. Mr. Broughton renders these words as to the sense the same, and as in connection with the following ones, "and prayed I not when plague was sent? when hurt came to any, thereupon cried I not?" and so do some others (k). <p>(h) "verum", Mercerus; profecto, Drusius, Bolducius; "sane", Tigurine version.

The verse, so interpreted means, Does not one stretch out his hand for help in his downfall? does he not when being destroyed, or, in his misfortune, utter a cry? Job explains how in his misery he cries unto God, it is the instinct of mankind. The following verse, referring to Job’s compassion when he saw others in trouble, suggests that he naturally looked for the same compassion to himself. The word <span class="ital">cry</span> (second clause), if referred to a different root, might mean <span class="ital">riches</span> (so ch. <a href="/job/36-19.htm" title="Will he esteem your riches? no, not gold, nor all the forces of strength.">Job 36:19</a>), and the verse would mean, <span class="ital">surely one stretches not out his hand against a heap</span> (of ruins), <span class="ital">or, hath he riches from another’s</span> (lit. <span class="ital">his</span>, or <span class="ital">its</span>) <span class="ital">destruction</span>? Job characterizes himself as a heap of ruins, and, appealing to the Almighty, argues that against such a thing one does not stretch out a hostile hand; neither does one derive advantage to himself from another’s calamity.

This is one of the most obscure passages in the entire Book of Job, and scarcely any two independent commentators understand it alike. To give all the different renderings, and discuss them, would be an almost endless task, and one over-wearisome to the reader. It will, per-Imps, suffice to select the one which to the present writer appears the most satisfactory. This is the rendering of Professor Stanley Leathes, who suggests the following: "Howbeit God will not put forth his hand to bring a man to death and the grave, when there is earnest prayer for them, not even when he himself hath caused the calamity." The same writer further explains the passage as follows: "I know that thou wilt dissolve and destroy me, and bring me to the grave (ver. 23), though thou wilt not do so when I pray to thee to release me by death from my sufferings. Thou wilt surely do so [some time or other], but not in my time, or according to my will, but only in thine own appointed time, and as thou seest fit." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/30.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>16  And now my soul is poured out within me,<p>Days of suffering hold me fast.<p>17  The night rendeth my bones from me,<p>And my gnawers sleep not.<p>18  By great force my garment is distorted,<p>As the collar of my shirt it encompasseth me.<p>19  He hath cast me into the mire,<p>And I am in appearance as dust and ashes.<p>With this third &#1493;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; (<a href="//biblehub.com/job/30-1.htm">Job 30:1</a>, <a href="/job/30-9.htm">Job 30:9</a>) the elegiac lament over the harsh contrast between the present and the past begins for the third time. The dash after our translation of the second and fourth strophes will indicate that a division of the elegy ends there, after which it begins as it were anew. The soul is poured out within a man (&#1506;&#1500;&#1497; as <a href="//biblehub.com/job/10-1.htm">Job 10:1</a>, Psychol. S. 152), when, "yielding itself without resistance to sadness, it is dejected to the very bottom, and all its organization flows together, and it is dissolved in the one condition of sorrow" - a figure which is not, however, come about by water being regarded as the symbol of the soul (thus Hitzig on <a href="/psalms/42-5.htm">Psalm 42:5</a>), but rather by the intimate resemblance of the representation of a flood of tears (<a href="/lamentations/2-19.htm">Lamentations 2:19</a>): the life of the soul flows in the blood, and the anguish of the soul in tears and lamentations; and since the outward man is as it were dissolved in the gently flowing tears (<a href="/isaiah/15-3.htm">Isaiah 15:3</a>), his soul flows away as it were in itself, for the outward incident is but the manifestation and result of an inward action. &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1470;&#1506;&#1504;&#1497; we have translated days of suffering, for &#1506;&#1504;&#1497;, with its verb and the rest of its derivatives, is the proper word for suffering, and especially the passion of the Servant of Jehovah.

The night has been personified already, <a href="/job/3-2.htm">Job 3:2</a>; and in general, as Herder once said, Job is the brother of Ossian for personifications: Night (the restless night, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/7-3.htm">Job 7:3</a>, in which every malady, or at least the painful feeling of it, increases) pierces his bones from him, i.e., roots out his limbs (synon. &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="/job/18-13.htm">Job 18:13</a>) so inwardly and completely. The lepra Arabica (Arab. 'l-brs&#803;, el-baras) terminates, like syphilis, with an eating away of the limbs, and the disease has its name Arab. jud&#817;a&#770;m from jd&#817;m, truncare, mutilare: it feeds on the bones, and destroys the body in such a manner that single limbs are completely detached.<p>In <a href="//biblehub.com/job/30-17.htm">Job 30:17</a>, lxx (&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;), Parchon, Kimchi, and others translate &#1506;&#1512;&#1511;&#1497; according to the Targum. &#1506;&#1512;&#1511;&#1497;&#1503; ( equals  &#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;), and the Arab. &#8219;ru&#770;q, veins, after which Blumenf.: my veins are in constant motion. But &#1506;&#1512;&#1511;&#1497; in the sense of <a href="/job/30-3.htm">Job 30:3</a> : my gnawers (Jer. qui me comedunt, Targ. &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1506;&#1505;&#1468;&#1503; &#1497;&#1514;&#1497;, qui me conculcant, conterunt), is far more in accordance with the predicate and the parallelism, whether it be gnawing pains that are thought of - pains are unnatural to man, they come upon him against his will, he separates them from himself as wild beasts - or, which we prefer, those worms (&#1512;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;, <a href="/job/7-5.htm">Job 7:5</a>) which were formed in Job's ulcers (comp. Aruch, &#1506;&#1512;&#1511;&#1488;, a leech, plur. &#1506;&#1512;&#1511;&#1514;&#1488;, worms, e.g., in the liver), and which in the extra-biblical tradition of Job's decease are such a standing feature, that the pilgrims to Job's monastery even now-a-days take away with them thence these supposedly petrified worms of Job.<p>(Note: In Mugir ed-dn's large history of Jerusalem and Hebron (kita&#770;b el-ins el-gel&#305;&#770;l), in an article on Job, we read: God had so visited him in his body, that he got the disease that devours the limbs (tegedhdhem), and worms were produced (dawwad) in the wounds, while he lay on a dunghill (mezbele), and except his wife, who tended him, no one ventured to come too near him. In a beautiful Kurdic ballad "on the basket dealer" (zembilfrosh), which I have obtained from the Kurds in Salihje, are these words:<p>Veki Gergis beshara beri<p>Jusuf veki abdan keri<p>Bikesr' Ejub kurman deri<p>continued...</body></html>
