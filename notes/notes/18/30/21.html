Harbouring hard thoughts of God was the sin which did, at this time, most easily beset Job. When inward temptations join with outward calamities, the soul is hurried as in a tempest, and is filled with confusion. But woe be to those who really have God for an enemy! Compared with the awful state of ungodly men, what are all outward, or even inward temporal afflictions? There is something with which Job comforts himself, yet it is but a little. He foresees that death will be the end of all his troubles. God's wrath might bring him to death; but his soul would be safe and happy in the world of spirits. If none pity us, yet our God, who corrects, pities us, even as a father pitieth his own children. And let us look more to the things of eternity: then the believer will cease from mourning, and joyfully praise redeeming love.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thou art become cruel to me - Margin, turned to be. This language, applied to God, seems to be harsh and irreverent, and it may well be inquired whether the word cruel does not express an idea which Job did not intend. The Hebrew word &#1488;&#1499;&#1494;&#1512;  'akza&#770;r, is from an obsolete root &#1499;&#1494;&#1512; - not found in Hebrew. The Arabic root, nearly the same as this, means to break with violence; to rout as an enemy; then to be enraged. In the Syriac, the primary idea is, that of a soldier, and thence it may refer to such acts of violence as a soldier commonly commits. The word occurs in Hebrew in the following places, and is translated in the following manner. It is rendered "cruel" in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-33.htm">Deuteronomy 32:33</a>; <a href="/job/30-21.htm">Job 30:21</a>; <a href="/proverbs/5-9.htm">Proverbs 5:9</a>; <a href="/proverbs/11-17.htm">Proverbs 11:17</a>; <a href="/proverbs/12-10.htm">Proverbs 12:10</a>; <a href="/proverbs/17-11.htm">Proverbs 17:11</a>; <a href="/proverbs/27-4.htm">Proverbs 27:4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/13-9.htm">Isaiah 13:9</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/6-23.htm">Jeremiah 6:23</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/50-42.htm">Jeremiah 50:42</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/30-14.htm">Jeremiah 30:14</a>; and fierce in <a href="/job/41-10.htm">Job 41:10</a>. Jerome renders it, mutatus mihi in crudelem - "thou art changed so as to become cruel to me;" the Septuagint renders it, &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;  anelee&#772;mono&#772;s - unmerciful; Luther, Du bist mir verwandelt in einem Grausamen - "thou art changed to me into a cruel one;" and so Umbreit, Noyes, and translators generally. Perhaps the word fierce, severe or harsh, would express the idea; still it must be admitted that Job, in the severity of his sufferings, is often betrayed into language which cannot be a model for us, and which we cannot vindicate.<p>With thy strong hand - Margin, the strength. So the Hebrew. The hand is the instrument by which we accomplish anything; and hence, anything which God does is traced to his hand.<p>Thou opposest thyselph against me -  - &#1514;&#1513;&#1474;&#1496;&#1502;&#1504;&#1497;  tis&#769;a&#770;t&#803;ame&#772;niy. The word &#1513;&#1474;&#1496;&#1501;  s&#769;a&#770;t&#803;am, means to lie in wait for anyone; to lay snares; to set a trap; see <a href="//biblehub.com/job/16-9.htm">Job 16:9</a>, where the same word occurs, and where it is rendered "who hateth me," but where it would be better rendered he pursues, or persecutes me. The meaning is, that God had become his adversary, or had set himself against him. There was a severity in his dealings with him as if he had become a foe. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/30.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20. stand up&#8212;the reverential attitude of a suppliant before a king (1Ki 8:14; Lu 18:11-13).<p>not&#8212;supplied from the first clause.

Or "turned", or "changed" (g), to be cruel to me. Job suggests that God had been kind and gracious to him, both in a way of providence, and in showing special love and favour to him, in a very distinguishing manner; but now he intimates his affections were changed and altered, and these were alienated from him, and his love was turned into an hatred of him; this is one of the unbecoming expressions which dropped from his lips concerning God; for the love of God to his people is never changed; it remains invariable and unalterable, in all dispensations, in every state and condition into which they come; there may be some of God's dispensations towards them, which may have the appearance of severity in them; and he may make use of instruments to chastise them, which may use them cruelly; but even then his heart yearns towards them, and, being full of compassion, delivers out of their hands, and saves them, <a href="/jeremiah/30-14.htm">Jeremiah 30:14</a>; <p>with thy strong hand thou opposest thyself against me; God has a strong hand and arm, and none like him, and sometimes he puts forth the strength of it, and exerts his mighty power in afflicting his people, and his hand presses them sore, and they can scarcely stand up under it; and then it becomes them to humble themselves under the mighty hand of God, and patiently bear it; and sometimes they take him to be their adversary, an enemy unto them, and filled with hatred of them, indignation against them, setting himself with all his might and main to ruin and destroy them; and this is a sad case indeed, to have such apprehensions of God, though unjust ones; for, as if God be for us, who shall be against us? so if he be against us, it signifies little who is for us; for there is no contending with him, <a href="/job/9-3.htm">Job 9:3</a>. <p>(g) "mutatus es", V.

Job never forgets that for long years God was gracious and kind to him, "made him and fashioned him together round about," "clothed him with skin and flesh, and fenced him with bones and sinews," "granted him life and favour, and by his visitation preserved his spirit" (<a href="/job/10-9.htm">Job 10:9-12</a>); but the recollection brings, perhaps, as much of pain. as of pleasure with it.

There is no ground in <a href="/job/30-15.htm">Job 30:15</a> for dividing, with Umbreit, thus: He hath turned against me! Terrors drove away, etc., although this would not be impossible according to the syntax (comp. <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/49-22.htm">Genesis 49:22</a>, &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; &#1510;&#1506;&#1491;&#1492;).

The subj. of <a href="/job/30-15.htm">Job 30:15</a> remains the same: they (these terrors) drive away my dignity like the wind; the construction is like <a href="/job/27-20.htm">Job 27:20</a>; <a href="/job/14-19.htm">Job 14:19</a>; on the matter, comp. <a href="/job/18-11.htm">Job 18:11</a>.

But the reference to &#1489;&#1500;&#1492;&#1493;&#1514; is more natural; and Hahn's objection, that calamity does not first, if it is there, drive away prosperity, but takes the place of that which is driven away, is sophisticated and inadequate, since the object of the driving away here is not Job's prosperity, but Job's &#1504;&#1491;&#1497;&#1489;&#1492;, appearance and dignity, by which he hitherto commanded the respect of others (Targ. &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;). The storms of suffering which pass over him take this nobility away to the last fragment, and his salvation - or rather, since this word in the mouth of an extra-Israelitish hero has not the meaning it usually otherwise has, his prosperous condition (from Arab. wasi&#8219;a, amplum esse) - is as a cloud, so rapidly and without trace (<a href="/job/7-9.htm">Job 7:9</a>; <a href="/isaiah/44-22.htm">Isaiah 44:22</a>), passed away and vanished. Observe the music of the expression &#1499;&#1468;&#1506;&#1489; &#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1492;, which cannot be reproduced in translation. </body></html>
