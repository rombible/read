He proves this truth of the destruction of the hopes and joys of hypocrites, by an appeal to former times. Bildad refers to the testimony of the ancients. Those teach best that utter words out of their heart, that speak from an experience of spiritual and divine things. A rush growing in fenny ground, looking very green, but withering in dry weather, represents the hypocrite's profession, which is maintained only in times of prosperity. The spider's web, spun with great skill, but easily swept away, represents a man's pretensions to religion when without the grace of God in his heart. A formal professor flatters himself in his own eyes, doubts not of his salvation, is secure, and cheats the world with his vain confidences. The flourishing of the tree, planted in the garden, striking root to the rock, yet after a time cut down and thrown aside, represents wicked men, when most firmly established, suddenly thrown down and forgotten. This doctrine of the vanity of a hypocrite's confidence, or the prosperity of a wicked man, is sound; but it was not applicable to the case of Job, if confined to the present world.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Can the rush - This passage has all the appearance of being a fragment of a poem handed down from ancient times. It is adduced by Bildad as an example of the views of the ancients, and, as the connection would seem to imply, as a specimen of the sentiments of those who lived before the life of man had been abridged. It was customary in the early ages of the world to communicate knowledge of all kinds by maxims, moral sayings, and proverbs; by apothegms and by poetry handed down from generation to generation. Wisdom consisted much in the amount of maxims and proverbs which were thus treasured up; as it now consists much in the knowledge which we have of the lessons taught by the past, and in the ability to apply that knowledge to the various transactions of life. The records of past ages constitute a vast storehouse of wisdom, and the present generation is more wise than those which have gone before, only because the results of their observations have been treasured up, and we can act on their experience, and because we can begin where they left off, and, taught by their experience, can avoid the mistakes which they made. The word "rush" here &#1490;&#1502;&#1488;  go&#770;me' denotes properly a bulrush, and especially the Egyptian papyrus - papyrus Nilotica; see the notes at <a href="/isaiah/18-2.htm">Isaiah 18:2</a>. It is derived from the verb &#1490;&#1502;&#1488;  ga&#770;ma&#770;', to absorb, to drink up, and is given to this plant because it absorbs or drinks up moisture. The Egyptians used it to make garments, shoes, baskets, and especially boats or skiffs; Pithy, Nat. His. 13. 21-26; see the notes at <a href="/isaiah/18-2.htm">Isaiah 18:2</a>. They also derived from it materials for writing - and hence, our word paper. The Septuagint renders it here, &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  papuros.<p>Without mire - Without moisture. It grew in the marshy places along the Nile.<p>Can the flag - Another plant of a similar character. The word &#1488;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;  'a&#770;chu&#770;, flag, says Gesenius, is an Egyptian word, signifying marsh-grass, reeds, bulrushes, sedge, everything which grows in wet grounds. The word was adopted not only into the Hebrew, but also into the Greek idiom of Alexandria, where it is written, &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;  achi, &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;  achei. Jerome says of it, "When I inquired of the learned what this word meant, I heard from the Egyptians, that by this name everything was intended in their language which grew up in a pool." The word is synonymous with rush, or bulrush, and denotes a plant which absorbs a great quantity of water. What is the exact idea which this figure is designed to convey, is not very clear. I think it probable that the whole description is intended to represent a hypocrite, and that the meaning is, that he had in his growth a strong resemblance to such a rush or reed. There was nothing solid or substantial in his piety. It was like the soft, spongy texture of the water-reed, and would wilt under trial, as the papyrus would when deprived of water. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. rush&#8212;rather, "paper-reed": The papyrus of Egypt, which was used to make garments, shoes, baskets, boats, and paper (a word derived from it). It and the flag, or bulrush, grow only in marshy places (such as are along the Nile). So the godless thrives only in external prosperity; there is in the hypocrite no inward stability; his prosperity is like the rapid growth of water plants.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/job/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Without mire, </span> i.e. if it be not in moist and miry ground.

It is generally admitted that the "papyrus" is meant "a plant of the <span class="accented">Cyperaceae</span> or sedge family, which was formerly common in Egypt" (Hooker, in Smith's 'Dict. of the Bible,' vol. 3. p. 1019). The chief peculiarity of the papyrus is its triangular stem, which rises to the height of six or seven, sometimes even of thirteen or fourteen, feet, and terminates in a bunch of thread-like flowering branchlets. The pith of these stems was the material of which the ancient Egyptians made their paper. The papyrus is a water-plant, and needs an abundant supply, but would often spring up out of any small pool which the Nile left as it retired, and, when the water failed from the peel, would rapidly wither away. A fine papyrus plant was on view, with other water-plants, in the circular greenhouse in Kew Gardens, towards the end of the season of 1890. Can the flag grow without water "The flag" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>) seems to be the ordinary sedge, or marah-plant. Like the papyrus, it would often spring up in all its greenness from a pool or pond left by the retiring river, and then in a few days, when the water was dried up, would wither away. Both images represent the prosperity of the wicked, and were probably proverbial. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>  5  If thou seekest unto God,<p>And makest supplication to the Almighty,<p>  6  If thou art pure and upright; Surely!<p>He will care for thee,<p>And restore the habitation of thy righteousness;<p>  7  And if thy beginning was small,<p>Thy end shall be exceeding great.<p>There is still hope for Job (&#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;, in opposition to his children), if, turning humbly to God, he shows that, although not suffering undeservedly, he is nevertheless pure and upright in his inmost mind. <a href="/job/8-6.htm">Job 8:6</a> is so intended; not as Mercier and others explain: si in posterum puritati et justitiae studueris. &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1500; &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1512;, to turn one's self to God earnestly seeking, constr. praegnans, like &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1500; &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;, <a href="/job/5-8.htm">Job 5:8</a>.

Completely falling back on &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1501;, the Piel signifies to recompense, off like being returned for like, and to restore, of a complete covering of the loss sustained. God will not only restore, but increase beyond measure, what Job was and had. The verb. masc. after &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; here is remarkable. But we need not, with Olsh., read &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1490;&#1468;&#1492;: we may suppose, with Ewald, according to 174, e, that &#1488;&#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; is purposely treated as masc.
