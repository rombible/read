God will not cast away an upright man; he may be cast down for a time, but he shall not be cast away for ever. Sin brings ruin on persons and families. Yet to argue, that Job was an ungodly, wicked man, was unjust and uncharitable. The mistake in these reasonings arose from Job's friends not distinguishing between the present state of trial and discipline, and the future state of final judgment. May we choose the portion, possess the confidence, bear the cross, and die the death of the righteous; and, in the mean time, be careful neither to wound others by rash judgments, nor to distress ourselves needlessly about the opinions of our fellow-creatures.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame - When they see your returning prosperity, and the evidences of the divine favor.

That is, God will favor the righteous, but punish the wicked. This opinion the friends of Job maintain all along, and by this they urge him to forsake his sins, repent, and return to God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22. The haters of Job are the wicked. They shall be clothed with shame (Jer 3:25; Ps 35:26; 109:29), at the failure of their hope that Job would utterly perish, and because they, instead of him, come to naught.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/job/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">They that hate thee, </span> that rejoice in thy calamities, shall be wholly covered with shame, shall be utterly confounded, when they shall observe thee, whom they have despised and insulted over, to be so wonderfully and surprisingly restored to thy former or a greater felicity. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Of the wicked; </span> either particularly of thy enemies, who dealt so unworthily and wickedly with thee; or more generally of all wicked men.

The Chaldeans and Sabeans, who had plundered him of his substance, when they should see him restored to his former prosperity, beyond all hope and expectation, and themselves liable to his resentment, and under the displeasure of Providence: the phrase denotes utter confusion, and such as is visible as the clothes upon a man's back; see <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/132-18.htm">Psalm 132:18</a>, <p>and the dwelling place of the wicked shall come to naught; or, "shall not be" (t); shall be no more; be utterly destroyed, and no more built up again; even such dwelling places they fancied would continue for ever, and perpetuate their names to the latest posterity; but the curse of God being in them, and upon them, they come to nothing, and are no more: thus ends Bildad's speech; Job's answer to it follows. <p>(t) "non erit", Pagninus, Mercerus, Drusius, Michaelis. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/8.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; and the dwelling place of the wicked shall come to nought.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/job/8.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">22</span>. In his concluding words Bildad puts himself and his friends right with Job, and desires to put Job right with himself and God. By referring to Job’s haters he intimates that he and his friends are none of them; and by identifying these haters with the wicked (<span class="ital"><a href="/job/8-22.htm" title="They that hate you shall be clothed with shame; and the dwelling place of the wicked shall come to nothing.">Job 8:22</a></span>), he lets Job know that he regards him as at heart one who belongs to quite a different class.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The position of Job’s friends cannot be understood at all unless we consider that they assumed Job’s piety at heart, but concluded from his calamities that he had been guilty of some great sins. And as Eliphaz had already brought to bear on Job’s mind the influence of a revelation, the next strongest argument was the consent of mankind. And to some minds, especially in that condition of perplexity and confusion on religious experience in which Job’s was, the general accord of mankind speaks with a more persuasive voice than anything called revelation. Bildad clearly enough perceived the drift of Job’s words in ch. 7; they were to the effect that the government of the world and the supreme Power in it was un-moral. And his reply, that mankind everywhere, and especially in circumstances that gave their judgment weight, had perceived a moral law ruling the universe, was conclusive as a general principle. His error lay in supposing that this was the only principle on which the universe was ruled, and in imagining that this principle operated always in a manner direct and immediate. Hence the principle lost its effectiveness in his hands by being stretched to uses which it did not cover.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame</span> (comp. <a href="/psalms/35-26.htm">Psalm 35:26</a>); <span class="cmt_word">and the dwelling-place</span> (literally, tent, or <span class="accented">tabernacle</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>of the wicked shall come to nought</span> (literally, <span class="accented">shall not be</span>)<span class="accented">. The</span> words are involved and obscure, because Bildad does not wish to make his meaning plain. He has to invent phrases which may cut both ways, and, while they seem directed against Job's enemies, may pain and wound Job himself. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>16  He dwells with sap in the sunshine,<p>And his branch spreads itself over his garden.<p>17  His roots intertwine over heaps of stone,<p>He looks upon a house of stones.<p>18  If He casts him away from his place,<p>It shall deny him: I have not seen thee.<p>19  Behold, thus endeth his blissful course,<p>And others spring forth from the dust.<p>The subject throughout is not the creeping-plant directly, but the ungodly, who is likened to it. Accordingly the expression of the thought is in part figurative and in part literal, &#1497;&#1495;&#1494;&#1492; &#1488;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; (<a href="/job/8-17.htm">Job 8:17</a>). As the creeper has stones before it, and by its interwindings, as it were, so rules them that it may call them its own (v. Gerlach: the exuberant growth twines itself about the walls, and looks proudly down upon the stony structure); so the ungodly regards his fortune as a solid structure, which he has quickly caused to spring up, and which seems to him imperishable. Ewald translates: he separates one stone from another; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;, according to 217, g, he considers equivalent to &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1504;&#1514;, and signifies apart from one another; but although &#1495;&#1494;&#1492;  equals  &#1495;&#1494;&#1494;, according to its radical idea, may signify to split, pierce through, still &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;, when used as a preposition, can signify nothing else but, within. Others, e.g., Rosenmller, translate: he marks a place of stones, i.e., meets with a layer of stones, against which he strikes himself; for this also &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; will not do. He who casts away (<a href="/job/8-18.htm">Job 8:18</a>) is not the house of stone, but God. He who has been hitherto prosperous, becomes now as strange to the place in which he flourished so luxuriantly, as if it had never seen him. Behold, that is the delight of his way (course of life), i.e., so fashioned, so perishable is it, so it ends. From the ground above which he sprouts forth, others grow up whose fate, when they have no better ground of confidence than he, is the same. After he has placed before Job both the blessed gain of him who trusts, and the sudden destruction of him who forgets, God, as the result of the whole, Bildad recapitulates: </body></html>
