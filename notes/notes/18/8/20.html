God will not cast away an upright man; he may be cast down for a time, but he shall not be cast away for ever. Sin brings ruin on persons and families. Yet to argue, that Job was an ungodly, wicked man, was unjust and uncharitable. The mistake in these reasonings arose from Job's friends not distinguishing between the present state of trial and discipline, and the future state of final judgment. May we choose the portion, possess the confidence, bear the cross, and die the death of the righteous; and, in the mean time, be careful neither to wound others by rash judgments, nor to distress ourselves needlessly about the opinions of our fellow-creatures.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man - On the meaning of the word perfect, see the note at <a href="/job/1-1.htm">Job 1:1</a>. The sentiment of Bildad, or the inference which he draws from the whole argument is, that God will be the friend of the pious, but that he will not aid the wicked. This accords with the general sentiment maintained in the argument of the friends of Job.<p>Neither will he help the evil doers - Margin, "Take the ungodly by the hand." This is in accordance with the Hebrew. The figure is that of taking one by the hand in order to assist him; see <a href="/isaiah/42-6.htm">Isaiah 42:6</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20. Bildad regards Job as a righteous man, who has fallen into sin.<p>God will not cast away a perfect man&#8212;(or godly man, such as Job was), if he will only repent. Those alone who persevere in sin God will not help (Hebrew, "take by the hand," Ps 73:23; Isa 41:13; 42:6) when fallen.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/job/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Heb. <span class="ital">God will not despise or reject</span>, i.e. he will not deny them his help, as appears by the opposite and following branch of the verse; he will not suffer them to be utterly lost. <span class="ital">Help</span>, i.e. deliver them out of their troubles. Hence it may seem that thou, O Job, art not a perfect or upright man, but an evil-doer. But this is certain, if for the future thy heart and way be not perfect, and thou dost not cease to do evil, thou wilt be utterly and irrecoverably lost; as, on the contrary, if thou dost repent and reform, he will help and deliver thee, and restore thee to thy former glory and happiness; which promise, though it be not here expressed, is sufficiently implied in the contrary threatening, as is evident from the following words, which plainly suppose it, and have a reference to it; such ellipses of contraries being not unusual in Scripture, as we shall see hereafter, especially in the Book of the Proverbs. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/job/8.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man,.... A sincere, upright, good man; one that is truly gracious; who, though he is not "perfect" in himself, yet in Christ; and though not with respect to sanctification, which is as yet imperfect in him, yet with respect to justification, being perfectly justified by the righteousness of Christ, and all his sins pardoned for his sake: such an one God will never "cast away"; not out of his sight, being engraven on the palms of his hands, nor out of his heart's love; or will not "loath" (r) him, as the Targum, or reject him with abhorrence and contempt; he will not cast him out of his covenant, which is ordered in all things and sure; nor out of the hands of his son, where he has put him, and from whence none can pluck; nor out of his family, where the son abides for ever; or so as to perish eternally, this would be contrary to his love, to his foreknowledge, and to his covenant; so far is he from it, that he has the greatest regard for such, delights in them, admits thereto nearness to himself, sets them as a seal on his heart, keeps them as the apple of his eye, and preserves them safe to his kingdom and glory: <p>neither will he help the evil doers; meaning, not everyone that does evil, or sins, but such who live in sin, make a trade of sinning, are frequent and constant in the commission of it; such God will not help, or "take by the hand" (s), in order to deliver from evil, as Gersom observes; to help them out of mischief and trouble their sins have brought upon them; or to strengthen them, support and uphold them, in their present circumstances, and much less so as to admit them to fellowship and communion with him: these words, with what follow, are Bildad's conclusion upon the sayings and sentiments of the ancients, which may be supposed, and are thought by some, to end at the preceding <a href="/job/8-19.htm">Job 8:19</a>. <p>(r) "abominatur", Vatablus; "aversatur", Beza, Mercerus, Drusius, Piscator.

The phrase, God will not cast off a “perfect” man, becomes almost the text of Job’s reply, cf. ch. <a href="/context/job/9-20.htm" title="If I justify myself, my own mouth shall condemn me: if I say, I am perfect, it shall also prove me perverse....">Job 9:20-21</a>; <a href="/job/10-3.htm" title="Is it good to you that you should oppress, that you should despise the work of your hands, and shine on the counsel of the wicked?">Job 10:3</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">help the evil doers</span>] lit. <span class="ital">hold by the hand of</span> evil-doers, cf. <a href="/isaiah/41-13.htm" title="For I the LORD your God will hold your right hand, saying to you, Fear not; I will help you.">Isaiah 41:13</a>; <a href="/isaiah/42-6.htm" title="I the LORD have called you in righteousness, and will hold your hand, and will keep you, and give you for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles;">Isaiah 42:6</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man</span>. Bildad winds up with words of apparent trust in, and good will towards, Job. God is absolutely just, and will neither forsake the righteous man nor uphold the wicked one. If Job is, as he says, true to God, upright, and (humanly speaking) "perfect," then he has only to go on trusting God; God will not leave him "till he fill his mouth with laughing, and his lips with rejoicing" (ver 21); then "they that irate him shall be clothed with shame, and their dwelling-place shall come to nought' (ver. 22); but if, as we feel instinctively that Bildad believes, Job is not "perfect," but "an evil-doer," then he must expect no relief, no lull in his sufferings; he is obnoxious to all the threatenings which have formed the bulk of Bildad's discourse (vers. 8-20) - be may look to being cut off, like the rush and the flag (vers. 11, 12), crushed like the spider's web (ver. 14), destroyed, and forgotten, like the rapidly growing gourd (Vers. 16-19); he must look for no help from God (ver. 20); but must be contented to pass away and make room for men of a better stamp (ver. 19). Neither will he help the evil-doers; literally, <span class="accented">neither will he grasp the hand of</span>  <span class="accented">evil-doers</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> though he may support them for a while, he will not maintain them firmly and constantly. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>11  Doth papyrus grow up without mire?<p>Doth the reed shoot up without water?<p>12  It is still in luxuriant verdure, when it is not cut off,<p>Then before all other grass it with<p>13  So is the way of all forgetters of God,<p>And the hope of the ungodly perisheth,<p>14  Because his hope is cut off,<p>And his trust is a spider's house:<p>15  He leaneth upon his house and it standeth not,<p>He holdeth fast to it and it endureth not.<p>Bildad likens the deceitful ground on which the prosperity of the godless stands to the dry ground on which, only for a time, the papyrus or reed finds water, and grows up rapidly: shooting up quickly, it withers as quickly; as the papyrus plant, <p>(Note: Vid., Champollion-Figeac, Aegypten, German translation, pp. 47f.)<p>if it has no perpetual water, though the finest of grasses, withers off when most luxuriantly green, before it attains maturity. &#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1488;, which, excepting here, is found only in connection with Egypt (<a href="/exodus/2-3.htm">Exodus 2:3</a>; <a href="/isaiah/18-2.htm">Isaiah 18:2</a>; and <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/35-7.htm">Isaiah 35:7</a>, with the general &#1511;&#1504;&#1492; as specific name for reed), is the proper papyrus plant (Cypeerus papyyrus, L.): this name for it is suitably derived in the Hebrew from &#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1488;, to suck up (comp. Lucan, iv. 136: conseritur bibul Memphytis cymba papyro); but is at the same time Egyptian, since Coptic kam, cham, signifies the reed, and 'go&#770;m, 'go&#772;me, a book (like liber, from the bark of a tree).<p>(Note: Comp. the Book of the Dead (Todtenbuch), ch. 162: "Chapter on the creation of warmth at the back of the head of the deceased. Words over a young cow finished in pure gold. Put them on the neck of the dead, and paint them also on a new papyrus," etc. Papyrus is here cama: the word is determined by papyrus-roll, fastening and writing, and its first consonant corresponds to the Coptic aspirated g. Moreover, we cannot omit to mention that this cama  equals  go&#770;me also signifies a garment, as in a prayer: "O my mother Isis, come and veil me in thy cama." Perhaps both ideas are represented in volumen, involucrum; it is, however, also possible that goome is to be etymologically separated from kam, cham  equals  &#1490;&#1502;&#1488;.)<p>continued...</body></html>
