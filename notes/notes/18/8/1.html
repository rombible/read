He would have even wrought a miracle for the preservation or restoration of such a person; and he concludes that since, from the known attributes of God, it was impossible he should cut off the innocent, or suffer the guilty to go free; and, as no interposition of providence had happened in his behalf, he thought him in a likely way, by his utter destruction, to prove a terrible example of the truth of that principle which they had urged against him.” — Heath and Dodd.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/job/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:1-7 Job spake much to the purpose; but Bildad, like an eager, angry disputant, turns it all off with this, How long wilt thou speak these things? Men's meaning is not taken aright, and then they are rebuked, as if they were evil-doers. Even in disputes on religion, it is too common to treat others with sharpness, and their arguments with contempt. Bildad's discourse shows that he had not a favourable opinion of Job's character. Job owned that God did not pervert judgment; yet it did not therefore follow that his children were cast-aways, or that they did for some great transgression. Extraordinary afflictions are not always the punishment of extraordinary sins, sometimes they are the trials of extraordinary graces: in judging of another's case, we ought to take the favorable side. Bildad puts Job in hope, that if he were indeed upright, he should yet see a good end of his present troubles. This is God's way of enriching the souls of his people with graces and comforts. The beginning is small, but the progress is to perfection.

This was the second of Job's friends that came to visit him, <a href="/job/2-11.htm">Job 2:11</a>; and is mentioned next to Eliphaz there, and takes his turn in this controversy in the same side; which no doubt was agreed upon among themselves, as well as the part each should bear, and the general sentiment they should pursue, which was the same in them all. Some have observed, that Job's friends were like the messengers that brought him the tidings of his losses, before one had done speaking another came; and so as soon as one of his friends had delivered his discourse, and before Job could well finish his reply, up starts another to charge him afresh, as here Bildad did, who said as follows. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/8.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/job/8.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>1–7.

Before coming to his principle and by way of introducing it Bildad expresses his wonder that Job should allow himself to speak such things as his discourse contained. <span class="ital">These things</span> are such things as ch. <a href="/job/6-29.htm" title="Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yes, return again, my righteousness is in it.">Job 6:29</a>, <a href="/context/job/7-1.htm" title="Is there not an appointed time to man on earth? are not his days also like the days of an hireling?...">Job 7:1-2</a>; <a href="/context/job/7-12.htm" title="Am I a sea, or a whale, that you set a watch over me?...">Job 7:12-21</a>, and perhaps even ch. <a href="/job/6-10.htm" title="Then should I yet have comfort; yes, I would harden myself in sorrow: let him not spare; for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One.">Job 6:10</a>.

Bildad the Shuhite has the second place in the passage where Job's friends are first mentioned (<a href="/job/2-11.htm">Job 2:11</a>), and occupies the same relative position in the dialogue. We may suppose him to have been younger than Eliphaz and older than Zophar. He does little more than repeat the arguments of Eliphaz, stating them, however, more bluntly, and with less of tact and consideration. The chief novelties of his discourse are an appeal to the teaching of past ages (vers 8-10), and the employment of new and forcible metaphors (vers. 11-19). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>12  Am I a sea or a sea-monster,<p>That thou settest a watch over me?<p>13  For I said, My bed shall comfort me;<p>My couch shall help me to bear my complaint.<p>14  Then thou scaredst me with dreams,<p>And thou didst wake me up in terror from visions,<p>15  So that my soul chose suffocation,<p>Death rather than this skeleton.<p>16  I loathe it, I would not live alway;<p>Let me alone, for my days are breath.<p>Since a watch on the sea can only be designed to effect the necessary precautions at its coming forth from the shores, it is probable that the poet had the Nile in mind when he used &#1497;&#1501;, and consequently the crocodile by &#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503;. The Nile is also called &#1497;&#1501; in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/19-5.htm">Isaiah 19:5</a>, and in Homer &#x3c9;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;, Egyptian oham ( equals  &#x3c9;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;), and is even now called (at least by the Bedouins) bahhr (Arab. bahr). The illustrations of the book, says von Gerlach correctly, are chiefly Egyptian. On the contrary, Hahn thinks the illustration is unsuitable of the Nile, because it is not watched on account of its danger, but its utility; and Schlottman thinks it even small and contemptible without assigning a reason. The figure is, however, appropriate. As watches are set to keep the Nile in channels as soon as it breaks forth, and as men are set to watch that they may seize the crocodile immediately he moves here or there; so Job says all his movements are checked at the very commencement, and as soon as he desires to be more cheerful he feels the pang of some fresh pain. In <a href="//biblehub.com/job/7-13.htm">Job 7:13</a>, &#1489; after &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488; is partitive, as <a href="/numbers/11-17.htm">Numbers 11:17</a>; Mercier correctly: non nihil querelam meam levabit. If he hopes for such repose, it forthwith comes to nought, since he starts up affrighted from his slumber. Hideous dreams often disturb the sleep of those suffering with elephantiasis, says Avicenna (in Stickel, S. 170). Then he desires death; he wishes that his difficulty of breathing would increase to suffocation, the usual end of elephantiasis. &#1502;&#1495;&#1504;&#1511; is absolute (without being obliged to point it &#1502;&#1495;&#1504;&#1511; with Schlottm.), as e.g., &#1502;&#1512;&#1502;&#1505;, <a href="/isaiah/10-6.htm">Isaiah 10:6</a> (Ewald, 160, c). He prefers death to these his bones, i.e., this miserable skeleton or framework of bone to which he is wasted away. He despises, i.e., his life, <a href="/job/9-21.htm">Job 9:21</a>. Amid such suffering he would not live for ever. &#1492;&#1489;&#1500;, like &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;, <a href="/job/7-7.htm">Job 7:7</a>. </body></html>
