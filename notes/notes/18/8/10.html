He proves this truth of the destruction of the hopes and joys of hypocrites, by an appeal to former times. Bildad refers to the testimony of the ancients. Those teach best that utter words out of their heart, that speak from an experience of spiritual and divine things. A rush growing in fenny ground, looking very green, but withering in dry weather, represents the hypocrite's profession, which is maintained only in times of prosperity. The spider's web, spun with great skill, but easily swept away, represents a man's pretensions to religion when without the grace of God in his heart. A formal professor flatters himself in his own eyes, doubts not of his salvation, is secure, and cheats the world with his vain confidences. The flourishing of the tree, planted in the garden, striking root to the rock, yet after a time cut down and thrown aside, represents wicked men, when most firmly established, suddenly thrown down and forgotten. This doctrine of the vanity of a hypocrite's confidence, or the prosperity of a wicked man, is sound; but it was not applicable to the case of Job, if confined to the present world.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Shall not they teach thee - The results of human conduct, and the great principles on which God governs the world.<p>And utter words out of their heart - Dr. Good renders this,<p>"And well forth the sayings of their wisdom,"<p>And supposes it means that the words of wisdom would proceed from them as water bubbles from a fountain. But this, I think, is a mere conceit. The true sense is, that they would not speak that merely which comes from the mouth, or that which comes upper most, and without reflection - as the Greeks say, &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#788;&#769; &#x3c4;&#x3b9; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#837;  legein pan ho ti epi stoma elthe&#772;; or, as the Latins, Quicquid in buccam venerit loqui - to speak whatever comes in the mouth; but they would utter that which came from the heart - which was sincere, and the result of deep and prolonged reflection. Perhaps, also, Bildad means to insinuate that Job had uttered what was uppermost in his mind, without taking time for reflection. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. teach thee&#8212;Job 6:24 had said, "Teach me."

They will teach thee."<p>utter words&#8212;more than mere speaking; "put forth well-considered words."<p>out of their heart&#8212;from observation and reflection; not merely, from their mouth: such, as Bildad insinuates, were Job's words. Job 8:11-13 embody in poetic and sententious form (probably the fragment of an old poem) the observation of the elders. The double point of comparison between the ungodly and the paper-reed is: 1. the luxuriant prosperity at first; and, 2. the sudden destruction.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/job/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Assuredly they will inform thee that it is as we say. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Out of their heart; </span> not partially, but sincerely, speaking their inward thoughts; not rashly, but from deep consideration; not by hearsay from others, but their own knowledge and experience. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/job/8.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Shall not they teach thee, and tell thee,.... That is, the men of the former age, and their fathers before them, Job is directed to inquire of, and to prepare for a search into their records and traditions; from whom he might reasonably expect to be taught and told things that would be very instructive and useful to him in his present circumstances: <p>and utter words out of their heart? such as were the effect of mature judgment and long observation, and which they had laid up in their hearts, and brought out from their treasure there; and, with the greatest faithfulness and sincerity, had either committed them to writing, or delivered them in a traditionary way to their posterity, to be communicated to theirs; and which might be depended upon as true and genuine, being men of probity, uprightness, and singleness of heart; who declared sincerely what they knew, and spoke not with a double heart, having no intention to deceive, as it cannot be thought they would impose upon their own children; and therefore Job might safely receive what they uttered, and depend upon it as truth and fact; and what they said, as Jarchi observes, is as follows; or what follows Bildad collected from them, and so might Job, and think he heard them "saying", as Piscator supplies the text, what is expressed in the following verses, if not in their words, yet as their sense. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/8.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Shall not they teach thee, and tell thee, and utter words out of their heart?</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/job/8.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">10</span>. <span class="ital">words out of their heart</span>] Words not the result of hasty and superficial generalizing, but of an experience which the lengthened lives of these men had enabled them to pass through, and the principles learned in which had sunk into their heart.

He means that Job's speeches are like the wind in their nothingness, and like a boisterous wind in their vehemence. Bildad sees the justice of God, the Absolute One, which ought to be universally acknowledged, impugned in them. In order not to say directly that Job's children had died such a sudden death on account of their sin, he speaks conditionally. If they have sinned, death is just the punishment of their sin. God has not arbitrarily swept them away, but has justly given them over to the destroying hand of their wickedness, - a reference to the prologue which belongs inseparably to the whole. </body></html>
