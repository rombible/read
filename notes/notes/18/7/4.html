Observe man's present place: he is upon earth. He is yet on earth, not in hell. Is there not a time appointed for his abode here? yes, certainly, and the appointment is made by Him who made us and sent us here. During that, man's life is a warfare, and as day-labourers, who have the work of the day to do in its day, and must make up their account at night. Job had as much reason, he thought, to wish for death, as a poor servant that is tired with his work, has to wish for the shadows of the evening, when he shall go to rest. The sleep of the labouring man is sweet; nor can any rich man take so much satisfaction in his wealth, as the hireling in his day's wages. The comparison is plain; hear his complaint: His days were useless, and had long been so; but when we are not able to work for God, if we sit still quietly for him, we shall be accepted. His nights were restless. Whatever is grievous, it is good to see it appointed for us, and as designed for some holy end. When we have comfortable nights, we must see them also appointed to us, and be thankful for them. His body was noisome. See what vile bodies we have. His life was hastening apace. While we are living, every day, like the shuttle, leaves a thread behind: many weave the spider's web, which will fail, ch. 8:14. But if, while we live, we live unto the Lord, in works of faith and labours of love, we shall have the benefit, for every man shall reap as he sowed, and wear as he wove.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>When I lie down - I find no comfort and no rest on my bed. My nights are long, and I am impatient to have them passed, and equally so is it with the day. This is a description which all can understand who have been laid on a bed of pain.<p>And the night be gone - Margin, evening be measured. Herder renders this, "the night is irksome to me." The word rendered night (&#1506;&#1512;&#1489;  &#8219;ereb) properly means the early part of the night, until it is succeeded by the dawn. Thus, in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/1-5.htm">Genesis 1:5</a>," And the evening (&#1506;&#1512;&#1489;  &#8219;ereb) and the morning were the first day." Here it means the portion of the night which is before the dawning of the aurora - the night. The word rendered "be gone" and in the margin "be measured" (   &#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1491;  m&#305;&#770;ddad), has been variously rendered. The verb &#1502;&#1491;&#1491;  ma&#770;dad means to stretch, to extend, to measure; and, according to Gesenius, the form of the word used here is a noun meaning flight, and the sense is, "when shall be the flight of the night?" He derives it from &#1504;&#1491;&#1491;  na&#770;dad to move, to flee, to flee away. So Rosenmuller explains it. The expression is poetic, meaning, when shall the night be gone?<p>I am full of tossings to and fro - (&#1504;&#1491;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;  na&#770;du&#770;d&#305;&#770;ym). A word from the same root. It means uneasy motions, restlessness. He found no quiet repose on his bed.<p>Unto the dawning - &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1507;  nesheph, from &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1507;  na&#770;shaph, to breathe; hence, the evening twilight because the breezes blow, or seem to breathe, and then it means also the morning twilight, the dawn. Dr. Stock renders it, "until the morning breeze." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4.
