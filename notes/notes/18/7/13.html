This contributed no little to render the night so unwelcome and wearisome to him. How easily can God, when he pleases, meet us with terror there where we promised ourselves ease and repose. Nay, he can make us a terror to ourselves; and, as we have often contracted guilt, by the rovings of an unsanctified fancy, he can likewise, by the power of our imagination, create us a great deal of grief, and so make that our punishment which has often been our sin. Job’s dreams might probably arise, in part, from his distemper, but, no doubt, Satan also had a hand in them. We have reason to pray, that our dreams may neither defile nor disquiet us; neither tempt us to sin, nor torment us with fear; that he who keeps Israel, who neither slumbers nor sleeps, would keep us when we slumber and sleep. And we ought to bless God if we lie down and our sleep is sweet, and we are not thus scared.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/job/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:7-16 Plain truths as to the shortness and vanity of man's life, and the certainty of death, do us good, when we think and speak of them with application to ourselves. Dying is done but once, and therefore it had need be well done. An error here is past retrieve. Other clouds arise, but the same cloud never returns: so a new generation of men is raised up, but the former generation vanishes away. Glorified saints shall return no more to the cares and sorrows of their houses; nor condemned sinners to the gaieties and pleasures of their houses. It concerns us to secure a better place when we die. From these reasons Job might have drawn a better conclusion than this, I will complain. When we have but a few breaths to draw, we should spend them in the holy, gracious breathings of faith and prayer; not in the noisome, noxious breathings of sin and corruption. We have much reason to pray, that He who keeps Israel, and neither slumbers nor sleeps, may keep us when we slumber and sleep. Job covets to rest in his grave. Doubtless, this was his infirmity; for though a good man would choose death rather than sin, yet he should be content to live as long as God pleases, because life is our opportunity of glorifying him, and preparing for heaven.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>When I say, My bed shall comfort me - The idea in this verse and the following is, that there was no intermission to his sorrows.

When he thought within himself that he would lie down upon his bed and try if he could get a little sleep, which might comfort and refresh him, and which he promised himself he should obtain by this means, as he had formerly had an experience of: <p>my couch shall ease my complaint; he concluded, that by lying down upon his couch, and falling asleep, it would give some ease of body and mind; that his body would, at least, for some time be free from pain, and his mind composed, and should cease from complaining for a while; which interval would be a relief to him, and of considerable service. Some render it, "my couch shall burn" (h); be all on fire, and torture me instead of giving ease; and so may have respect to his burning ulcers. <p>(h) "ardebit", Pagninus; so Kimchi in Sepher Shorash. &amp; Ben Melech in loc. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my complaints;</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/job/7.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">13, 14</span>.

Sometimes, notwithstanding his many "wearisome nights" (ver. 5), Job would entertain a hope of a few hours' rest and tranquillity, as, wearied and exhausted, he sought his couch, and laid himself down upon it, but only to be disappointed. <span class="cmt_word">Then thou scarest me with dreams, and terrifiest me through visions</span>. Unpleasant dreams are said to be a symptom, or at any rate a frequent concomitant, of elephantiasis; but Job seems to speak of something worse than these. Horrible visions came upon him, which he believed to be sent directly from the Almighty, and which effectually disturbed his rest, making night hideous. Probably this was one of the modes in which Satan was permitted to try and test him. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>  7  Remember that my life is a breath,<p>That my eye will never again look on prosperity.<p>  8  The eye that looketh upon me seeth me no more;<p>Thine eyes look for me, - I am no more!<p>  9  The clouds are vanished and passed away,<p>So he that goeth down to Shel cometh not up.<p>10  He returneth no more to his house,<p>And his place knoweth him no more.<p>11  Therefore I will not curb my mouth;<p>I will speak in the anguish of my spirit;<p>I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.<p>We see good, i.e., prosperity and joy, only in the present life.

Here we first meet with the name of the lower world; and in the book of Job we learn the ancient Israelitish conception of it more exactly than anywhere else. We have here only to do with the name in connection with the grammatical exposition. &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1500; (usually gen. fem.) is now almost universally derived from &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1500;  equals  &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1500;, to be hollow, to be deepened; and aptly so, for they imagined the Sheo&#770;l as under ground, as <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/16-30.htm">Numbers 16:30</a>, <a href="/numbers/16-33.htm">Numbers 16:33</a> alone shows, on which account even here, as from <a href="/genesis/37-35.htm">Genesis 37:35</a> onwards, &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492; &#1497;&#1512;&#1491; is everywhere used. It is, however, open to question whether this derivation is correct: at least passages like <a href="/isaiah/5-14.htm">Isaiah 5:14</a>; <a href="/habakkuk/2-5.htm">Habakkuk 2:5</a>; <a href="/proverbs/30-15.htm">Proverbs 30:15</a>., show that in the later usage of the language, &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1500;, to demand, was thought of in connection with it; derived from which Sheo&#770;l signifies (1) the appointed inevitable and inexorable demanding of everything earthly (an infinitive noun like &#1488;&#1500;&#1493;&#1492;&#1468;, &#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1493;&#1491;); (2) conceived of as space, the place of shadowy duration whither everything on earth is demanded; (3) conceived of according to its nature, the divinely appointed fury which gathers in and engulfs everything on the earth. Job knows nothing of a demanding back, a redemption from Sheo&#770;l. </body></html>
