Observe man's present place: he is upon earth. He is yet on earth, not in hell. Is there not a time appointed for his abode here? yes, certainly, and the appointment is made by Him who made us and sent us here. During that, man's life is a warfare, and as day-labourers, who have the work of the day to do in its day, and must make up their account at night. Job had as much reason, he thought, to wish for death, as a poor servant that is tired with his work, has to wish for the shadows of the evening, when he shall go to rest. The sleep of the labouring man is sweet; nor can any rich man take so much satisfaction in his wealth, as the hireling in his day's wages. The comparison is plain; hear his complaint: His days were useless, and had long been so; but when we are not able to work for God, if we sit still quietly for him, we shall be accepted. His nights were restless. Whatever is grievous, it is good to see it appointed for us, and as designed for some holy end. When we have comfortable nights, we must see them also appointed to us, and be thankful for them. His body was noisome. See what vile bodies we have. His life was hastening apace. While we are living, every day, like the shuttle, leaves a thread behind: many weave the spider's web, which will fail, ch. 8:14. But if, while we live, we live unto the Lord, in works of faith and labours of love, we shall have the benefit, for every man shall reap as he sowed, and wear as he wove.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>So am I made to possess - Hebrew I am made to inherit.

How long his trials had continued before this, we have no means of ascertaining. There is no reason, however, to suppose that his bodily sufferings came upon him all at once, or that they had not continued for a considerable period. It is quite probable that his expressions of impatience were the result not only of the intensity, but the continuance of his sorrows.<p>And wearisome nights are appointed to me - Even his rest was disturbed.

Job describes his day as “months of vanity” and “nights of trouble,” indicating that his disease had already endured a long time. He refers to “nights” perhaps because his pains were severest then (cf. <span class="ital"><a href="/job/7-4.htm" title="When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone? and I am full of tossings to and fro to the dawning of the day.">Job 7:4</a>; <a href="/job/7-14.htm" title="Then you scare me with dreams, and terrify me through visions:">Job 7:14</a></span>, ch. <a href="/job/30-17.htm" title="My bones are pierced in me in the night season: and my sinews take no rest.">Job 30:17</a>); although in the East the method also of counting by nights instead of days was common.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So am I made to possess months of vanity</span>. "Months of vanity" are "months of which he can make no use " - "months which  are no good to him." It has been concluded from this theft some considerable time had elapsed since Job was stricken by his disease. But he is perhaps looking to the future as much as to the past, anticipating a long, lingering illness. Elephantiasis is a disease which often lasts for years<span class="cmt_word">. And wearisome nights are appointed to me</span>. To one stretched on a bed of sickness, the night is always more wearisome than the day. It has no changes, nothing to mark its flight. It seems almost interminable. In elephantiasis, however, it is a special feature of the disease that the sufferings of the patient are greatest at night. "In <span class="accented">elephantiasis ansesthetica</span>" says Dr. Erasmus Wilson, "a sense of dulness and heat pervades the surface, and there are sensations of tingling and prickling, and of burning heat. While the integument is insensible, there are deep-seated burning pains, sometimes of a bone or joint, sometimes of the vertebral column. <span class="accented">These pains are greatest at night</span>; <span class="accented">they prevent sleep</span>, <span class="accented">and give rise to restlessness and frightful dreams"</span> (Quain's 'Dictionary of Medicine,' vol. 1. p. 817). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>24  Teach me, and I will be silent,<p>And cause me to understand wherein I have failed.<p>25  How forcible are words in accordance with truth!<p>But what doth reproof from you reprove?<p>26  Do you think to reprove words?<p>The words of one in despair belong to the wind.<p>27  Ye would even cast lots for the orphan,<p>And traffic about your friend.<p>&#1504;&#1502;&#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/6-25.htm">Job 6:25</a>, in the signification of &#1504;&#1502;&#1500;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468; (<a href="/psalms/119-103.htm">Psalm 119:103</a>), would suit very well: how smooth, delicate, sweet, are, etc. (Hirz., Ew., Schlottm.); but this meaning does not suit <a href="/job/16-3.htm">Job 16:3</a>. Hupfeld, by comparison with mar, bitter, translates: quantumvis acerba; but &#1502;&#1492; may signify quidquid, though not quantumvis.

In <a href="/job/6-26.htm">Job 6:26</a> the waw introduces a subordinate adverbial clause: while, however, the words of one in despair belong to the wind, that they may be carried away by it, not to the judgment which retains and analyzes them, without considering the mood of which they are the hasty expression. The futt. express the extent to which their want of feeling would go, if the circumstances for it only existed; they are subjunctive, as <a href="//biblehub.com/job/3-13.htm">Job 3:13</a>, <a href="/job/3-16.htm">Job 3:16</a>. &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;&#1500;, the lot, is to be supplied to &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;, as <a href="/1_samuel/14-42.htm">1 Samuel 14:42</a>. The verb &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492;, however, does not here signify to dig, so that &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1514;, a pit, should be supplied (Heiligst.), still less: dig out earth, and cast it on any one (Ebrard); but has the signification of buying and selling with &#1506;&#1500; of the object, exactly like <a href="/job/39-27.htm">Job 39:27</a>. </body></html>
