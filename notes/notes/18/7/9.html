Dying is done but once, and therefore it had need be well done. An error here is past retrieve. Other clouds arise, but the same cloud never returns: so a new generation of men is raised up, but the former generation vanishes away. Glorified saints shall return no more to the cares and sorrows of their houses; nor condemned sinners to the gaieties and pleasures of their houses. It concerns us to secure a better place when we die. From these reasons Job might have drawn a better conclusion than this, I will complain. When we have but a few breaths to draw, we should spend them in the holy, gracious breathings of faith and prayer; not in the noisome, noxious breathings of sin and corruption. We have much reason to pray, that He who keeps Israel, and neither slumbers nor sleeps, may keep us when we slumber and sleep. Job covets to rest in his grave. Doubtless, this was his infirmity; for though a good man would choose death rather than sin, yet he should be content to live as long as God pleases, because life is our opportunity of glorifying him, and preparing for heaven.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away - This image is taken from the light and fleecy clouds, which become smaller and smaller until they wholly vanish.

Which being dispersed by the wind, or broke up by the sun, is never seen, or returns more; for though the wise man speaks of clouds returning after the rain, this is not to be understood of the same clouds, but of succeeding ones, <a href="/ecclesiastes/12-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:2</a>; so pardon of sin is expressed by the same metaphor, to show that sin thereby is no more, no more to be seen or remembered, <a href="/isaiah/43-25.htm">Isaiah 43:25</a>; the Targum renders it "as smoke", by which the shortness and consumption of men's days are expressed, <a href="/psalms/102-3.htm">Psalm 102:3</a>; but by the simile of a cloud here is not so much designed the sudden disappearance of life as the irrevocableness of it when gone, as the reddition or application following shows: <p>so he that goeth down to the grave shall come up no more; the grave is the house or long home that all must go to, it being the appointment of God that all should die, or be in the state of the dead; which is meant by the grave, since all are not interred in the earth; and this, as here, is frequently expressed, as if it was man's act being hither brought; and when it designs an interment in the earth, it is with great propriety called a going down; and however that be, yet the state of the dead is a state of humiliation, a coming down from all the grandeur, honour, and glory of the present state, which are all laid in the dust; and when this is man's case, he comes up no more from it, that is, of himself, by his own power; none but Christ, who is God over all, ever did this; or none naturally, or by the laws of nature, for noticing short of almighty power can effect this; it must be done in an extraordinary way, and is no less than a miraculous operation; nor will this be done until the general resurrection of the just and unjust, when all that are in their graves shall come forth, the one to the resurrection of life, and the other to the resurrection of damnation; excepting in some few instances, as the Shunammite's son, <a href="/2_kings/4-32.htm">2 Kings 4:32</a>; the man that touched the bones of the prophet Elisha, <a href="/2_kings/13-21.htm">2 Kings 13:21</a>; the daughter of Jairus, <a href="/mark/5-41.htm">Mark 5:41</a>; the widow of Nain's son, <a href="/luke/7-14.htm">Luke 7:14</a>; Lazarus, <a href="/john/11-43.htm">John 11:43</a>; and those that rose at our Lord's resurrection, <a href="/matthew/27-53.htm">Matthew 27:53</a>; this is further explained in <a href="/job/7-10.htm">Job 7:10</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{e}</span> <i>As</i> the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away: so he that goeth down to the grave shall <span class="cverse3">{f}</span> come up no <i>more</i>.</span><p>(e) If you behold me in your anger I will not be able to stand in your presence.<p>(f) Shall no more enjoy this mortal life.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/job/7.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">9</span>. <span class="ital">goeth down to the grave</span>] Heb., <span class="ital">down to She’ôl</span>, the place of departed persons. This is never in the Old Testament confounded with the grave, although, being an ideal place and state, the imagination often paints it in colours borrowed from the grave and the condition of the body in death; cf. ch. <a href="/job/3-13.htm" title="For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest,">Job 3:13</a> <span class="ital">seq</span>., <a href="/job/10-21.htm" title="Before I go from where I shall not return, even to the land of darkness and the shadow of death;">Job 10:21</a> <span class="ital">seq</span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As the aloud is consumed and vanisheth away</span>. In mountainous countries one sees clouds clinging to a mountain-side, which do not float away, but gradually shrink, and at last wholly disappear.

What exactly was Job's idea of this world it is impossible to say, or whether it involved the continued separate identity of individual souls and their continued consciousness. In Isaiah's conception both seem certainly to have been involved (<a href="/isaiah/14-9.htm">Isaiah 14:9-18</a>), and perhaps in Jacob's (<a href="/genesis/37-35.htm">Genesis 37:35</a>); but Job s creed on the subject can only be conjectured. It is certain, however, that both the Egyptians and the early Babylonians held the continuance after death of individual souls, their separate existence, and their consciousness (see the author's 'History of Ancient Egypt,' vol. 1. pp. 317-319; and 'Religions of the Ancient World,' pp. 62-65). Shall come up no  more. The Egyptian belief was that the soul would ultimately return to the body from which death separated it, and rein-habit it. But this belief was certainly not general among the nations of antiquity. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>  1  Has not a man warfare upon earth,<p>And his days are like the days of a hireling?<p>  2  Like a servant who longs for the shade,<p>And like a hireling who waits for his wages,<p>  3  So am I made to possess months of disappointment,<p>And nights of weariness are appointed to me.<p>The conclusion is intended to be: thus I wait for death as refreshing and rest after hard labour.
