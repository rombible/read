If we look about us, to the earth and waters here below, we see his almighty power. If we consider hell beneath, though out of our sight, yet we may conceive the discoveries of God's power there. If we look up to heaven above, we see displays of God's almighty power. By his Spirit, the eternal Spirit that moved upon the face of the waters, the breath of his mouth, Ps 33:6, he has not only made the heavens, but beautified them. By redemption, all the other wonderful works of the Lord are eclipsed; and we may draw near, and taste his grace, learn to love him, and walk with delight in his ways. The ground of the controversy between Job and the other disputants was, that they unjustly thought from his afflictions that he must have been guilty of heinous crimes. They appear not to have duly considered the evil and just desert of original sin; nor did they take into account the gracious designs of God in purifying his people. Job also darkened counsel by words without knowledge. But his views were more distinct. He does not appear to have alleged his personal righteousness as the ground of his hope towards God. Yet what he admitted in a general view of his case, he in effect denied, while he complained of his sufferings as unmerited and severe; that very complaint proving the necessity for their being sent, in order to his being further humbled in the sight of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The pillars of Heaven tremble - That is, the mountains, which seem to bear up the heavens. So, among the ancients. Mount Atlas was represented as one of the pillars of heaven. Virgil speaks of "Atlas whose brawny back supports the skies." And Hesiod, ver. 785, advances the same notion:<p>"Atlas, so hard necessity ordains,<p>Great, the ponderous vault of stars sustains<p>Not far from the Hesperides he stands,<p>Nor from the load retracts his head or hands."<p>The word "reproof" in this verse refers to the language of God, as if spoken in anger to rebuke the mountains or the earth. Perhaps the reference is to thunder, to storms, and to winds, which seem to be the voice of God; compare <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/29-3.htm">Psalm 29:3-8</a>. Similar descriptions of the majesty and glory of God abound in the Scriptures, where he speaks to the earth, the mountains, the hills, and they tremble. Thus, in <a href="/psalms/104-32.htm">Psalm 104:32</a>;<p>He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth;<p>He toucheth the hills, and they smoke.<p>So in <a href="/habakkuk/3-10.htm">Habakkuk 3:10</a> :<p>The mountains saw thee, and they trembled;<p>The overflowing of the water passed by;<p>The deep uttered his voice, and lift up his hands on high.<p>So in <a href="//biblehub.com/nahum/1-5.htm">Nahum 1:5</a>, "The mountains quake at him, and the hills melt, and the earth is burnt at his presence." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/26.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. pillars&#8212;poetically for the mountains which seem to bear up the sky (Ps 104:32).<p>astonished&#8212;namely, from terror.

Those mountains which by their height and strength may seem to reach and support the heavens, as the poets said of Atlas; for this is a poetical book, and there are many poetical expressions in it. These tremble sometimes by force of earthquakes, or by God’s glorious appearance in them, as Sinai did. Or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. Holy angels; but they are not subject either to trembling, or to God’s rebuke. Or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. The heavenly bodies, as the sun, and moon, and stars, which as they may seem in some sort to support, so they do certainly adorn the heavens; and we know pillars are oft made, not to support, but only for ornament; as the two famous pillars of the temple, Jachin and Boaz, <span class="bld"><a href="/1_kings/7-21.htm" title="And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple: and he set up the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin: and he set up the left pillar, and called the name thereof Boaz.">1 Kings 7:21</a></span>. And these ofttimes seem to tremble and be astonished, as in eclipses or tempests, and terrible works of God in the air, by which they are frequently said to be affected and changed, because they seem so to us; and many things are spoken in Scripture according to appearance: see <span class="bld"><a href="/isaiah/13-10.htm" title="For the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not give their light: the sun shall be darkened in his going forth, and the moon shall not cause her light to shine.">Isaiah 13:10</a> 24:23 <a href="/joel/2-10.htm" title="The earth shall quake before them; the heavens shall tremble: the sun and the moon shall be dark, and the stars shall withdraw their shining:">Joel 2:10</a>,31 Mt 24:29</span>, &c. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">At his reproof; </span> either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

The “pillars” of the heavens, if the conception be not wholly ideal, may be the lofty mountains on which the heavens seem to rest, and which, as they are lost in the clouds, are spoken of as belonging to heaven. At God’s rebuke, when His voice of thunder rolls, or when earthquakes shake the earth, they tremble with terror of His majesty,<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The pillars of heaven tremble</span>. The "pillars of heaven" are the mountains, on which the sky seems to rest. These "tremble," or seem to tremble, at the presence of God (<a href="/psalms/18-7.htm">Psalm 18:7</a>; <a href="/psalms/114-4.htm">Psalm 114:4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/5-25.htm">Isaiah 5:25</a>) when he visits the earth in storm and tempest, either because the whole atmosphere is full of disturbance, and the outline of the mountains shifts and changes as rain and storm sweep over them, or because the reverberations of the thunder, which shake the air, seem to shake the earth also. <span class="cmt_word">And are astonished at his reproof</span>. To the mind of the poet this "trembling" is expressive of astonishment and consternation. He regards the mountains as hearing the voice of God in the storm, recognizing it as raised in anger, and so trembling and cowering before him. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/26.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>  5   - The shades are put to pain<p>Deep under the waters and their inhabitants.<p>  6  Shel is naked before him,<p>And the abyss hath no covering.<p>  7  He stretched the northern sky over the emptiness;<p>He hung the earth upon nothing.<p>Bildad has extolled God's majestic, awe-inspiring rule in the heights of heaven, His immediate surrounding; Job continues the strain, and celebrates the extension of this rule, even to the depths of the lower world. The operation of the majesty of the heavenly Ruler extends even to the realm of shades; the sea with the multitude of its inhabitants forms no barrier between God and the realm of shades; the marrowless, bloodless phantoms or shades below writhe like a woman in travail as often as this majesty is felt by them, as, perhaps, by the raging of the sea or the quaking of the earth.

It is a question whether &#1497;&#1495;&#1493;&#1500;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; be Pilel (Ges.) or Pulal (Olsh.); the Pul., indeed, signifies elsewhere to be brought forth with writing (<a href="/job/15-7.htm">Job 15:7</a>); it can, however, just as well signify to be put in pain. On account of the reference implied in it to a higher causation here at the commencement of the speech, the Pul. is more appropriate than the Pil.; and the pausal , which is often found elsewhere with Hithpael (Hithpal.), <a href="/psalms/88-14.htm">Psalm 88:14</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/33-5.htm">Job 33:5</a>, but never with Piel (Pil.), proves that the form is intended to be regarded as passive.</body></html>
