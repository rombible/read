And if the former part of the sentence means that God sometimes, by his power, raises a violent storm at sea, the latter may well enough be understood of the pride and swelling of the sea itself, allayed again by the same divine power and will which raised it.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/job/26.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>26:5-14 Many striking instances are here given of the wisdom and power of God, in the creation and preservation of the world. If we look about us, to the earth and waters here below, we see his almighty power. If we consider hell beneath, though out of our sight, yet we may conceive the discoveries of God's power there. If we look up to heaven above, we see displays of God's almighty power. By his Spirit, the eternal Spirit that moved upon the face of the waters, the breath of his mouth, Ps 33:6, he has not only made the heavens, but beautified them. By redemption, all the other wonderful works of the Lord are eclipsed; and we may draw near, and taste his grace, learn to love him, and walk with delight in his ways. The ground of the controversy between Job and the other disputants was, that they unjustly thought from his afflictions that he must have been guilty of heinous crimes. They appear not to have duly considered the evil and just desert of original sin; nor did they take into account the gracious designs of God in purifying his people. Job also darkened counsel by words without knowledge. But his views were more distinct. He does not appear to have alleged his personal righteousness as the ground of his hope towards God. Yet what he admitted in a general view of his case, he in effect denied, while he complained of his sufferings as unmerited and severe; that very complaint proving the necessity for their being sent, in order to his being further humbled in the sight of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He divideth the sea with His power - Herder renders this:<p>By his power he scourgeth the sea,<p>By his wisdom he bindeth its pride.<p>Jerome (Vulgate), "By his power the seas are suddenly congregated together The Septuagint, "By his power - &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bd; &#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;  katepause te&#772;n thalassan - he makes the sea calm." Luther, Vor seiner Kraft wird das Meer plotzlich ungestum - "By his power the sea becomes suddenly tempestuous." Noyes renders it, "By his power he stilleth the sea." This is undoubtedly the true meaning. There is no allusion here to the dividing of the sea when the Israelites left Egypt; but the ideals, that God has power to calm the tempest, and hush the waves into peace. The word used here (&#1512;&#1490;&#1506;  ra&#770;ga&#8219;) means, to make afraid, to terrify; especially, to restrain by threats; see the notes at <a href="/isaiah/51-15.htm">Isaiah 51:15</a>; compare <a href="/jeremiah/31-35.htm">Jeremiah 31:35</a>.

The word means “to terrify,” and the parallelism of the second clause “smiteth through Rahab,” which refers to the subduing of a raging monster, suggests that the sea when “terrified” or rebuked is in a state of fury, and is quelled by the power of God. So already the Sept. κατέπαυσεν.

"Divideth" is certainly a wrong translation. The verb used (<span class="hebrew">&#x5be;&#x5b8;&#x5d2;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span>) means either "stirreth up" or "stilleth." In favour of the former rendering are Rosen-muller, Schultens, Delitzsch, Merx, and Canon Cook; in favour of the latter, the LXX., Dillmann, and Dr. Stanley Leathes. In either case the general sentiment is that God has full mastery over the sea, and can regulate its movements at his pleasure. <span class="cmt_word">And by his understanding he smiteth through the proud</span>; literally, he <span class="accented">smiteth through Rahab.</span> (On Rahab, as the great power of evil, see the comment on Job 9:13.)
