We must notice the glory of God, not only in the thunder and lightning, but in the more common and less awful changes of the weather; as the snow and rain. Nature directs all creatures to shelter themselves from a storm; and shall man only be unprovided with a refuge? Oh that men would listen to the voice of God, who in many ways warns them to flee from the wrath to come; and invites them to accept his salvation, and to be happy. The ill opinion which men entertain of the Divine direction, peculiarly appears in their murmurs about the weather, though the whole result of the year proves the folly of their complaints. Believers should avoid this; no days are bad as God makes them, though we make many bad by our sins.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/37.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And it is turned round about - The word here rendered "it" (&#1492;&#1493;&#1488;  hu&#770;') may refer either to the "cloud," and then it will mean that it is driven about at the pleasure of God; or it may refer to God, and then it will mean that "he" drives it about at pleasure. The sense is not materially varied. The use of the Hebrew participle rendered "turned about" (in Hithpael), would rather imply that it refers to the cloud. The sense then is, that it turns itself round about - referring to the appearance of a cloud in the sky that rolls itself about from one place to another.<p>By his counsels - By the counsels or purposes of God. It is not by any agency or power of its own, but it is by laws such as he has appointed, and so as to accomplish his will. The object is to keep up the idea that God presides over, and directs all these things. The word which is rendered "counsels" (&#1514;&#1495;&#1489;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492;  tachebu&#770;la&#770;h) means properly a "steering, guidance, management," <a href="/proverbs/11-14.htm">Proverbs 11:14</a>. It is usually applied to the act of steering, as a vessel, and then to prudent management, wise counsel, skillful measures. It is rendered "wise counsels," and "counsels," <a href="/proverbs/1-5.htm">Proverbs 1:5</a>; <a href="/proverbs/11-14.htm">Proverbs 11:14</a>; <a href="/proverbs/12-5.htm">Proverbs 12:5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/24-6.htm">Proverbs 24:6</a>, and "good advice," <a href="/proverbs/20-18.htm">Proverbs 20:18</a>. It does not elsewhere occur in the Scriptures. The word is derived from &#1495;&#1489;&#1500;  chebel, "a rope," or &#1495;&#1489;&#1500;  cho&#770;be&#770;l, "a sailor, pilot," and hence, the idea of "steering," or "directing." The meaning is, that the movements of the clouds are entirely under the "direction" of God, as the vessel is of the pilot or helmsman. The Septuagint appears not to have understood the meaning of the word, and have not attempted to translate it. They retain it in their version, writing it, &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#768;q  theeboulatho&#772;th, showing, among other instances, how the Hebrew was "pronounced" by them.<p>That they may do whatsoever he commandeth them - See <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/147-17.htm">Psalm 147:17-18</a>. The idea is, that even the clouds, which appear so capricious in their movements, are really under the direction of God, and are accomplishing his purposes. They do not move at haphazard, but they are under the control of one who intends to accomplish important purposes by them. Elihu had made this observation respecting the lightning <a href="//biblehub.com/job/36-30.htm">Job 36:30-33</a>, and he now says that the same thing was true of the clouds. The investigations of science have only served to confirm this, and to show that even the movements of the clouds are regulated by laws which have been ordained by a Being of infinite intelligence. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/37.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. it&#8212;the cloud of lightning.<p>counsels&#8212;guidance (Ps 148:8); literally, "steering"; the clouds obey God's guidance, as the ship does the helmsman. So the lightning (see on [543]Job 36:31, 32); neither is haphazard in its movements.<p>they&#8212;the clouds, implied in the collective singular "it."<p>face of the world, &c.&#8212;in the face of the earth's circle.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/job/37.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">It is turned round about; </span> the clouds (now mentioned) are carried about to this or that place. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">By his counsels; </span> not by chance, (though nothing seems to be more casual and uncertain than the motions of the clouds,) but by his order and governance. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">That they may do whatsoever he commandeth them; </span> either be dispersed and pass away without effect, to the disappointment of the husbandmen’s hopes, or be dissolved in sweet and fruitful showers. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/job/37.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And it is turned round about by his counsels,....

Thence next ha&#770;wijatun, &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1; &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, i.e., &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;  equals  hu&#770;watun, uhw&#305;&#770;jatun, huwa&#770;atun, mahwa&#770;tun, a cleft, yawning deep, chasm, abyss, &#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, vorago; haw&#305;&#770;jatun and hauha&#770;tun (a reduplicated form), especially a very deep pit or well. But these same words, ha&#770;wijatun, hu&#770;watun, uhw&#305;&#770;jatun, mahwa&#770;tun, also signify, like the usual Arab. hawa'a&#770;'un, the &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; between heaven and earth, i.e., the wide, empty space, the same as 'gauwun. The wider significations, or rather applications and references of hawa&#770;: air set in motion, a current of air, wind, weather, are all secondary, and related to that primary signification as sama&#770;, rain-clouds, rain, grass produced by the rain, to the prim. signification height, heaven, vid., Mehren, Rhetorik d. Araber, S. 107, Z. 14ff. This hawa&#770;, however, also signifies in general: a broad, empty space, and by transferring the notion of "empty" to mind and heart, as the reduplicated forms hu&#770;hatun and hauha&#770;tun: devoid of understanding and devoid of courage, e.g., Koran xiv. 44: wa-af'i-datuhum hawa&#770;un, where Bedhw first explains hawa&#770; directly by chala&#770;, emptiness, empty space, i.e., as he adds, cha&#770;lijetun &#8219;an el-fahm, as one says of one without mind and courage qalbuhu hawa&#770;un. Thence also hauwun, emptiness, a hole, i.e., in a wall or roof, a dormar-window (kauwe, ku&#770;we), but also with the genit. of a person or thing: their hole, i.e., the space left empty by them, the side not taken up by them, e.g., qa&#8219;ada fi hauwihi, he set himself beside him. From the signification to be empty then comes (1) hawat el-mar'atu, i.e., vacua fuit mulier  equals  orba oiberis, as &#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;, vidua, properly empty, French vide; (2) hawa&#770; er-ragulu, i.e., vacuus, inanis factus est vir  equals  exanimatus (comp. Arab. frg, he became empty, euphemistic for he died).<p>From this variously applied primary signification is developed the generally known and usual Arab. hawa&#770;, loose and free, without being held or holding to anything one's self, to pass away, fly, swing, etc., libere ferri, labi, in general in every direction, as the wind, or what is driven hither and thither by the wind, especially however from above downwards, labi, delabi, cadere, deorsum ruere. From this point, like many similar, the word first passes into the signification of sound (as certainly also &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1492;, &#1513;&#1488;): as anything falling has a full noise, and so on, &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;, rumorem, fragorem edere (fragor from frangi), hence hawat udhnuhu jaw&#305;&#770;jan of a singing in the ears.<p>continued...</body></html>
