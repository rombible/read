We must notice the glory of God, not only in the thunder and lightning, but in the more common and less awful changes of the weather; as the snow and rain. Nature directs all creatures to shelter themselves from a storm; and shall man only be unprovided with a refuge? Oh that men would listen to the voice of God, who in many ways warns them to flee from the wrath to come; and invites them to accept his salvation, and to be happy. The ill opinion which men entertain of the Divine direction, peculiarly appears in their murmurs about the weather, though the whole result of the year proves the folly of their complaints. Believers should avoid this; no days are bad as God makes them, though we make many bad by our sins.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/37.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>By the breath of God frost is given - Not by the violent north wind, or by the whirlwind of the south, but God seems to "breathe" in a gentle manner, and the earth is covered with hoary frost. It appears in a still night, when there is no storm or tempest, and descends upon the earth as silently as if it were produced by mere breathing. Frost is congealed or frozen dew. On the formation and cause of dew, see the notes at <a href="/job/38-28.htm">Job 38:28</a>. The figure is poetical and beautiful. The slight motion of the air, even when the frost appears, seems to be caused by the breathing of God.<p>And the breadth of the waters is straitened - That is, is contracted by the cold; or is frozen over. The waters are "compressed" into a solid mass (&#1489;&#1502;&#1493;&#1510;&#1511;  bemu&#770;tsaq), or are in a state of "pressure" or "compression" - or so the word used here means. What were before expanded rivers or arms of the sea, are now compressed into solid masses of ice. This, also, is proof of the greatness and power of God, for though the cause was not understood by Elihu, yet there was no doubt that it was produced by his agency. Though the laws by which this occurs are now better understood than they were then, it is no less clearly seen that it is by his agency; and all the light which we obtain in regard to the laws by which these things occur, only serve to exalt our conceptions of the wisdom and greatness of God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/37.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. the breath of God&#8212;poetically, for the ice-producing north wind.<p>frost&#8212;rather, "ice."<p>straitened&#8212;physically accurate; frost compresses or contracts the expanded liquid into a congealed mass (Job 38:29, 30; Ps 147:17, 18).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/job/37.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">By the breath of God, </span> i.e. by the word of God, as this very phrase is explained, <span class="bld"><a href="/psalms/33-6.htm" title="By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth.">Psalm 33:6</a></span>; by his will or appointment, to which as the principal cause all these works are ascribed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The breadth of the waters is straitened; </span> the frost dries up the waters in great measure, and bringeth the remainder into a narrower compass, as we see. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/job/37.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>By the breath of God frost is given,....
