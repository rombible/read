We must notice the glory of God, not only in the thunder and lightning, but in the more common and less awful changes of the weather; as the snow and rain. Nature directs all creatures to shelter themselves from a storm; and shall man only be unprovided with a refuge? Oh that men would listen to the voice of God, who in many ways warns them to flee from the wrath to come; and invites them to accept his salvation, and to be happy. The ill opinion which men entertain of the Divine direction, peculiarly appears in their murmurs about the weather, though the whole result of the year proves the folly of their complaints. Believers should avoid this; no days are bad as God makes them, though we make many bad by our sins.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/37.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Also by watering - Very various interpretations have been given of this phrase. Herder renders it, "His brightness rendeth the clouds." Umbreit, Und Heiterkeit vertreibt die Wolke - "and serenity or clearness drives away the clouds." Prof. Lee, "For irrigation is the thick cloud stretched out." Rosenmuller, "Splendor dispels the clouds." Luther, "The thick clouds divide themselves that it may be clear." Coverdale, "The clouds do their labor in giving moistness." The Vulgate, "The grain desires the clouds," and the Septuagint, "The cloud forms the chosen" - &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  eklekton. This variety of interpretation arises from the uncertainty of the meaning of the original word - &#1489;&#1512;&#1497;  ber&#305;&#770;y. According to the Chaldee and the rabbis, this word means "clearness, serenity" of the heavens, and then the whole clause is to be rendered, "serenity dispelleth the cloud." Or the word may be formed of the preposition &#1489; (be), and &#1512;&#1497;  r&#305;&#770;y, meaning "watering" or "rain," the same as &#1512;&#1493;&#1497;  reviy. The word does not occur elsewhere in Hebrew, and hence, it is not easy to determine its meaning. The weight of authority is in favor of serenity, or clearness - meaning that the thick, dark cloud is driven away by the serenity or clearness of the atmosphere - as where the clear sky seems to light up the heavens and to drive away the clouds. This idea seems, also, to be demanded by the parallelism, and is also more poetical than that in the common version.<p>Wearieth - Or removes, or scatters. The verb used here (&#1496;&#1512;&#1495;  t&#803;a&#770;rach) occurs nowhere else in the Scriptures, though nouns derived from the verb are found in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/1-14.htm">Isaiah 1:14</a>, rendered "trouble," and <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-12.htm">Deuteronomy 1:12</a>, rendered "cumbrance." In Arabic it means "to cast down, to project," and hence, to lay upon as a burden. But the word may mean to impel, drive forward, and hence, the idea that the dark thick cloud is propelled or driven forward by the serenity of the sky. This "appears" to be so, and hence, the poetic idea as it occurred to Elihu.<p>He scattereth his bright cloud - Margin, "the cloud of his light." The idea seems to be, that "his light," that is, the light which God causes to shine as the tempest passes off, seems to scatter or disperse the cloud. The image before the mind of Elihu probably was, that of a departing shower, when the light seems to rise behind it, and as it were to expel the cloud or to drive it away. We are not to suppose that this is philosophically correct, but Elihu represents it as it appeared, and the image is wholly poetical. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/37.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11-13.

Rain is the chief necessity of Eastern countries; and God is ever providing it, causing moisture to be drawn up from earth and sea, and safely lodged in the clouds, whence it descends, as needed, and as commanded by God, upon the fields and plains that man cultivates. <span class="cmt_word">He scattereth his bright cloud</span>. Most commentators see a reference to lightning here; and it is possible, no doubt, that such a reference is intended. "His bright cloud" - literally, "the cloud of his light" - may mean "the cloud in which his lightning is stored." But perhaps no more is meant than that God spreads abroad over the earth the clouds on which his sunlight rests. The genial showers of spring fall generally from clouds that are, in part at any rate, steeped in the sun's rays. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/37.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>  1  Yea, at this my heart trembleth<p>And tottereth from its place.<p>  2  Hear, O hear the roar of His voice,<p>And the murmur that goeth out of His mouth.<p>  3  He sendeth it forth under the whole heaven,<p>And His lightning unto the ends of the earth.<p>  4  After it roareth the voice of the thunder,<p>He thundereth with the voice of His majesty,<p>And spareth not the lightnings, when His voice is heard.<p>  5  God thundereth with His voice marvellously,<p>Doing great things, incomprehensible to us.<p>Louis Bridel is perhaps right when he inserts after <a href="//biblehub.com/job/36.htm">Job 36</a> the observation: L'clair brille, la tonnerre gronde. &#1500;&#1494;&#1488;&#1514; does not refer to the phenomenon of the storm which is represented in the mind, but to that which is now to be perceived by the senses.
