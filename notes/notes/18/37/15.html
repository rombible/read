The best of men are much in the dark concerning the glorious perfections of the Divine nature and the Divine government.

So the Hebrew implies, and so the connection demands. The question was not whether Job knew "when" all this was done, but whether he could explain "how" it was that God thus arranged and ordered the things referred to. Elihu asks him whether he could explain the manner in which the balancings of the clouds were preserved; in which the lightnings were directed; in which his garments were warm, and in which God had made and sustained the sky? The Septuagint renders this, "We know that God hath disposed his works that he hath made light out of darkness."<p>And caused the light of his cloud to shine - That is, Canst thou explain the cause of lightning? Canst thou tell how it is that it seems to break out of a dark cloud? Where has it been concealed? And by what laws is it now brought forth? Elihu assumes that all this was done by the agency of God, and since, as he assumes to be true, it was impossible for people to explain the manner in which it was done, his object is to show that profound veneration should be shown for a God who works in this manner. Somewhat more is known now of the laws by which lightning is produced than there was in the time of Job; but the question may still be asked of man, and is as much fitted to produce awe and veneration as it was then, whether he understands the way in which God produces the bright lightning from the dark bosom of a cloud. Can he tell what is the exact agency of the Most High in it? Can he explain all the laws by which it is done? <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/37.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15. when&#8212;rather, "how."<p>disposed them&#8212;lays His charge on these "wonders" (Job 37:14) to arise.<p>light&#8212;lightning.<p>shine&#8212;flash.

Thence next ha&#770;wijatun, &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1; &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, i.e., &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;  equals  hu&#770;watun, uhw&#305;&#770;jatun, huwa&#770;atun, mahwa&#770;tun, a cleft, yawning deep, chasm, abyss, &#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, vorago; haw&#305;&#770;jatun and hauha&#770;tun (a reduplicated form), especially a very deep pit or well. But these same words, ha&#770;wijatun, hu&#770;watun, uhw&#305;&#770;jatun, mahwa&#770;tun, also signify, like the usual Arab. hawa'a&#770;'un, the &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; between heaven and earth, i.e., the wide, empty space, the same as 'gauwun. The wider significations, or rather applications and references of hawa&#770;: air set in motion, a current of air, wind, weather, are all secondary, and related to that primary signification as sama&#770;, rain-clouds, rain, grass produced by the rain, to the prim. signification height, heaven, vid., Mehren, Rhetorik d. Araber, S. 107, Z. 14ff. This hawa&#770;, however, also signifies in general: a broad, empty space, and by transferring the notion of "empty" to mind and heart, as the reduplicated forms hu&#770;hatun and hauha&#770;tun: devoid of understanding and devoid of courage, e.g., Koran xiv. 44: wa-af'i-datuhum hawa&#770;un, where Bedhw first explains hawa&#770; directly by chala&#770;, emptiness, empty space, i.e., as he adds, cha&#770;lijetun &#8219;an el-fahm, as one says of one without mind and courage qalbuhu hawa&#770;un. Thence also hauwun, emptiness, a hole, i.e., in a wall or roof, a dormar-window (kauwe, ku&#770;we), but also with the genit. of a person or thing: their hole, i.e., the space left empty by them, the side not taken up by them, e.g., qa&#8219;ada fi hauwihi, he set himself beside him. From the signification to be empty then comes (1) hawat el-mar'atu, i.e., vacua fuit mulier  equals  orba oiberis, as &#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;, vidua, properly empty, French vide; (2) hawa&#770; er-ragulu, i.e., vacuus, inanis factus est vir  equals  exanimatus (comp. Arab. frg, he became empty, euphemistic for he died).<p>From this variously applied primary signification is developed the generally known and usual Arab. hawa&#770;, loose and free, without being held or holding to anything one's self, to pass away, fly, swing, etc., libere ferri, labi, in general in every direction, as the wind, or what is driven hither and thither by the wind, especially however from above downwards, labi, delabi, cadere, deorsum ruere. From this point, like many similar, the word first passes into the signification of sound (as certainly also &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1492;, &#1513;&#1488;): as anything falling has a full noise, and so on, &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;, rumorem, fragorem edere (fragor from frangi), hence hawat udhnuhu jaw&#305;&#770;jan of a singing in the ears.<p>continued...</body></html>
