Elihu concludes with some short, but great sayings, concerning the glory of God. He speaks abruptly and in haste, because, it should seem, he perceived God was approaching, and presumed he was about to take the work into his own hands. <span class="ital">With God is terrible majesty — </span>Those glorious works of his, which I have described, are testimonies of that great and terrible majesty which is in him; which should cause us to fear and adore him, and not to behave ourselves so irreverently and insolently toward him as Job hath done. <span class="ital">We cannot find high out — </span>Namely, to perfection, as it is expressed <a href="/job/11-7.htm" title="Can you by searching find out God? can you find out the Almighty to perfection?">Job 11:7</a>. We cannot comprehend him; his power, wisdom, justice, and his counsels proceeding from them, are past our finding out. <span class="ital">He is excellent in power — </span>Therefore as he doth not need any unrighteous action to advance himself, so he cannot do any, because all such things are acts and evidences of weakness. <span class="ital">And in judgment — </span>In the just administration of judgment, he never did nor can exercise that power unjustly, as Job seemed to insinuate. <span class="ital">And in plenty of justice — </span>In great and perfect justice, such as no man can justly reproach. <span class="ital">He will not afflict — </span>Namely, without just cause, or above measure. He <span class="ital">doth not afflict willingly, </span>or <span class="ital">from his heart, </span><a href="/lamentations/3-33.htm" title="For he does not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men.">Lamentations 3:33</a>. He takes no pleasure in doing it. It is his work, indeed, but <span class="ital">a strange work, </span>as Isaiah elegantly terms it, <a href="/job/28-21.htm" title="Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living, and kept close from the fowls of the air.">Job 28:21</a>. <span class="ital">Men do therefore fear him — </span>Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">לכן</span>, <span class="ital">lachen, for this cause, </span>namely, because of God’s infinite and excellent perfections, and especially those mentioned in the foregoing verse, <span class="ital">men do, </span>or <span class="ital">should, fear, </span>or <span class="ital">reverence him, </span>and humbly submit to him, and not presume to quarrel or dispute with him. <span class="ital">He respecteth not — </span>Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">לא יראה</span>, <span class="ital">lo jireh, he doth not, </span>or <span class="ital">will not, behold, </span>namely, with respect or approbation; <span class="ital">any that are wise of heart — </span>That is, such as are wise in their own eyes, that lean to their own understanding, and despise other men in comparison of themselves, and reject their counsels; or, that are so puffed up with the opinion of their own wisdom, that they dare contend with their Maker, and presume to censure his counsels and actions: which he hereby intimates to be Job’s fault, and to be the true reason why God did not respect nor regard him, nor his prayers and tears, as Job complained. And so this is also a tacit advice and exhortation to Job to be humble and little in his own eyes, if ever he expected any favour from God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Thus Elihu, having set forth God’s omnipotence in the strongest colours he was able, concludes with an observation very applicable to the subject of dispute before them. “As this speaker,” says Dr. Dodd, “performs the part of a moderator, he seems to have observed the errors on both sides, and to have hit upon the point where the controversy ought to rest, namely, the unsearchable depth of the divine wisdom; with a persuasion that God, who is acknowledged on all hands to be infinitely powerful and just, will certainly find a way to clear up all the irregularities, as they now appear to us, in the methods of his providence, and bring this intricate and perplexed scene, at last, to a beautiful and regular close. The great fault of the speech seems to be this; that he bears too hard upon Job; and his reproofs, though there were some grounds for them, are nevertheless too harsh and severe. Nay, where he endeavours to repeat what Job had said, he gives it, for the most part, a wrong turn, or sets it in some very disadvantageous light. The silence of this good man, therefore, during this long speech of Elihu, may be considered as none of the least instances of his patience; but as he was convinced that one part of the charge brought against him was but too true, namely, that he had been now and then too hasty and intemperate in his expressions, he was resolved not to increase the fault by entering anew into the controversy; but by his silence and attention here, and suffering his passions to subside, he was the better prepared to receive the following speech from Jehovah with that profound humility, and that absolute submission, which became him.” <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/job/37.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>37:21-24 Elihu concludes his discourse with some great sayings concerning the glory of God. Light always is, but is not always to be seen. When clouds come between, the sun is darkened in the clear day. The light of God's favour shines ever towards his faithful servants, though it be not always seen. Sins are clouds, and often hinder us from seeing that bright light which is in the face of God. Also, as to those thick clouds of sorrow which often darken our minds, the Lord hath a wind which passes and clears them away. What is that wind? It is his Holy Spirit. As the wind dispels and sweeps away the clouds which are gathered in the air, so the Spirit of God clears our souls from the clouds and fogs of ignorance and unbelief, of sin and lust. From all these clouds the Holy Spirit of God frees us in the work of regeneration. And from all the clouds which trouble our consciences, the Holy Spirit sets us free in the work of consolation. Now that God is about to speak, Elihu delivers a few words, as the sum of all his discourse. With God is terrible majesty. Sooner or later all men shall fear him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/37.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Fair weather - Margin, "gold," The Hebrew word (&#1494;&#1492;&#1489;  za&#770;ha&#770;b) properly means "gold," and is so rendered by the Vulgate, the Syriac, and by most versions. The Septuagint renders it, &#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c8;&#x3b7; &#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;  nepse&#772; chrusaugounta, "clouds shining like gold." The Chaldee, &#1488;&#1505;&#1514;&#1504;&#1497;&#1488;, the north wind, Boreas. Many expositors have endeavored to show that gold was found in the northern regions (see Schultens, in loc.); and it is not difficult so to establish that fact as to be a confirmation of what is here said, on the supposition that it refers literally to gold. But it is difficult to see why Elihu should here make a reference to the source where gold was found, or how such a reference should be connected with the description of the approaching tempest, and the light which was already seen on the opening clouds. It seems probable to me that the idea is wholly different and that Elihu means to say that a bright, dazzling light was seen in the northern sky like burnished gold, which was a fit symbol of the approaching Deity. This idea is hinted at in the Septuagint, but it has not seemed to occur to expositors. The image is that of the heavens darkened with the tempest, the lightnings playing, the thunder rolling, and then the wind seeming to brush away the clouds in the north, and disclosing in the opening a bright, dazzling appearance like burnished gold, that bespoke the approach of God. The word is never used in the sense of "fair weather." An ancient Greek tragedian, mentioned by Grotius, speaks of golden air - &#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;  chruso&#772;pos aithe&#772;r. Varro also uses a similar expression - aurescit aer, "the air becomes like gold." So Thomson, in his Seasons:<p>But yonder comes the powerful king of day<p>Rejoicing in the east. The lessening cloud.<p>The kindling azure, and the mountain's brow,<p>Illumed with fluid gold, his near approach<p>Betoken glad.<p>Summer<p>Out of the north - That is, the symbol of the approaching Deity appears in that quarter, or God was seen to approach from the north. It may serve to explain this, to remark that among the ancients the northern regions were regarded as the residence of the gods, and that on the mountains in the north it was supposed they were accustomed to assemble. In proof of this, and for the reasons of it, see the notes at <a href="/isaiah/14-13.htm">Isaiah 14:13</a>. From that region Elihu sees God now approaching, and directs the attention of his companions to the symbols of his advent. It is this which fills his mind with so much consternation, and which renders his discourse so broken and disconnected. Having, in a manner evincing great alarm, directed their attention to these symbols, he concludes what he has to say in a hurried manner, and God appears, to close the controversy.<p>With God is terrible majesty - This is not a declaration asserting this of God in general, but as he then appeared. It is the language of one who was overwhelmed with his awful majesty, as the brightness of his presence was seen on the tempest. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/37.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22. Rather, "golden splendor." Maurer translates "gold." It is found in northern regions. But God cannot be "found out," because of His "Majesty" (Job 37:23). Thus the twenty-eighth chapter corresponds; English Version is simpler.<p>the north&#8212;Brightness is chiefly associated with it (see on [546]Job 23:9). Here, perhaps, because the north wind clears the air (Pr 25:23). Thus this clause answers to the last of Job 37:21; as the second of this verse to the first of Job 37:21. Inverted parallelism. (See Isa 14:13; Ps 48:2).<p>with God&#8212;rather, "upon God," as a garment (Ps 104:1, 2).<p>majesty&#8212;splendor.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/job/37.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Fair weather; </span> or, <span class="ital">when</span> (which particle may well be understood out of, the foregoing verse; and so this may be a further description of the time when men cannot see or gaze upon the sun, namely, when) <span class="ital">fair weather</span>, &c.
