We must notice the glory of God, not only in the thunder and lightning, but in the more common and less awful changes of the weather; as the snow and rain. Nature directs all creatures to shelter themselves from a storm; and shall man only be unprovided with a refuge? Oh that men would listen to the voice of God, who in many ways warns them to flee from the wrath to come; and invites them to accept his salvation, and to be happy. The ill opinion which men entertain of the Divine direction, peculiarly appears in their murmurs about the weather, though the whole result of the year proves the folly of their complaints. Believers should avoid this; no days are bad as God makes them, though we make many bad by our sins.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/37.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For he saith to the snow - That is, the snow is produced by the command of God, and is a proof of his wisdom and greatness. The idea is, that; the formation of snow was an illustration of the wisdom of God, and should teach people to regard him with reverence. It is not to be supposed that the laws by which snow is formed in the atmosphere were understood in the time of Elihu. The fact that it seemed to be the effect of the immediate creation of God, was the principal idea in the mind of Elihu in illustrating his wisdom. But it is not less fitted to excite our admiration of his wisdom now that the laws by which it is produced are better understood; and in fact the knowledge of those laws is adapted to elevate our conceptions of the wisdom and majesty of Him who formed them. The investigations and discoveries of science do not diminish the proofs of the Creator's wisdom and greatness. but every new discovery tends to change blind admiration to intelligent devotion; to transform wonder to praise. On the formation of snow, see the notes at <a href="/job/38-22.htm">Job 38:22</a>.<p>Be thou on the earth - There is a strong resemblance between this passage and the sublime command in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/1-3.htm">Genesis 1:3</a>, "And God said, Let there be light, and there was light." Each of them is expressive of the creative power of God, and of the ease with which he accomplishes his purposes.<p>Likewise to the small rain - Margin, "and to the shower of rain, and to the showers of rain of his strength." The word which is used here in the Hebrew (&#1490;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501;  geshem), means "rain" in general, and the phrase "small rain" (    &#1490;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501;    (  &#1502;&#1496;&#1512; ma&#770;t&#803;a&#770;r geshem), seems to be used to denote the "rain" simply, without reference to its violence, or to its being copious. The following phrase, "the great rain of his strength" (&#1506;&#1494;&#1493;&#1468; &#1502;&#1496;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; &#1490;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501;  geshem ma&#770;t&#803;a&#770;ro&#770;t &#8219;o&#770;zu&#770;) refers to the rain when it has increased to a copious shower. The idea before the mind of Elihu seems to have been that of a shower, as it commences and increases until it pours down torrents, and the meaning is, that alike in the one case and the other, the rain was under the command of God, and obeyed his will. The whole description here is that which pertains to winter, and Elihu refers doubtless to the copious rains which fell at that season of the year. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/37.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. Be&#8212;more forcible than "fall," as Umbreit translates Ge 1:3.<p>to the small rain, &c.&#8212;He saith, Be on the earth. The shower increasing from "small" to "great," is expressed by the plural "showers" (Margin), following the singular "shower."

In the original it is, be thou earth: hence one of the Rabbins formed a notion, that the earth was created from snow under the throne of glory, which is justly censured by Maimonides (f); for there is a defect of the letter  as in <a href="/2_chronicles/34-30.htm">2 Chronicles 34:30</a>; as Aben Ezra observes; and therefore rightly supplied by us, on the earth. This is one of the great and incomprehensible things of God. What is the cause of it, how it is generated, what gives it its exceeding whiteness and its form, we rather guess at than certainly know; and there are some things relative to it not easy to be accounted for: as that it should be generated in the lower region of the air, so near us, and yet be so cold; and be so cold in its own nature, yet be like a blanket warming to the earth; and that being so cold, it should fall in hot countries, as in many parts of Africa, as Leo Africanus asserts (g); and though so easily melted, yet lies continually upon the top of a burning mountain, Mount Etna, as observed by Pineda and others. God has his treasures of it, and he brings it forth from thence; it is at his command, it goes at a word speaking; it is one of the things that fulfil his word, <a href="/psalms/148-8.htm">Psalm 148:8</a>. And if what Pliny (h) says is true, that snow never falls upon the high seas or main ocean, the expression here is, with great exactness and propriety, be thou on the earth. However, this is certain, that to the earth only it is useful, warming, refreshing, and fructifying; it has a wonderful virtue in it to fatten the earth. Olaus Magnus (i) reports, that in the northern countries, where it falls in great plenty, the fields are more fruitful than any others, and sooner put forth their fruits and increase than other fields prepared and cultivated with the greatest labour and diligence: and that they are often obliged to drive off the cattle from them, lest they should eat too much and burst, the fields and meadows becoming so luxurious by it; and frequently they mow off the tops of herbs and grass with their scythes, to prevent their growing too thick. The word of God, as for its purity, so for its warming, refreshing, and fructifying nature, is compared unto it, <a href="/isaiah/55-10.htm">Isaiah 55:10</a>; <p>likewise to the small rain, and to the great rain of his strength: that is, God says to these as to the snow, be upon the earth; and they presently are, whether lesser or larger showers: the lesser or more gentle, according to Seneca (k), fall in, the winter, and the larger in spring; the former when the north wind blows, the latter when the south; but whenever they come, they fall by the direction of God, and at his command. He and he only gives rain, the vanities of the Gentiles cannot; and these are sent to water and refresh the earth, and make it fruitful; for which reason also the word of God is compared thereunto, <a href="/deuteronomy/32-12.htm">Deuteronomy 32:12</a>. The Targum is, <p>"to the rain after rain in summer, to ripen the fruits; and to the rain after the rain, to cause the grass to bud in winter in his strength.'' <p>So a shower of rain in the singular number signifies rain that falls in summer; and a shower of rain in the plural what falls in winter. <p>(f) Moreh Nevochim, par. 2. c. 26.

The phenomenon of snow is always full of marvel to an Oriental. It comes before him so seldom; it is in itself so strange; it involves things so inexplicable as the sudden solidification of a liquid, crystallization, a marked expansion of bulk, and the sudden assumption by what was colourless of a definite and dazzling colour. In Arabia and the countries bordering on Palestine snow very seldom falls; but in Palestine itself the mountain ranges of Lebanon and Hermon are never without it; and in the region occupied by Job and his friends then is reason to believe that ice and snow were not altogether infrequent (see <a href="/job/6-16.htm">Job 6:16</a>, and the comment <span class="accented">ad loc</span>). <span class="cmt_word">Likewise to the small rain</span>; or, <span class="accented">to the light shower of rain -</span> "the spring rain," as the Chaldee paraphrast explains it. And to the great rain of his strength; or, "the heavy winter rain," according to the same authority. "The former and the latter rain" - the rain of winter, and the rain of spring - are often mentioned by the sacred writers (see <a href="/deuteronomy/11-14.htm">Deuteronomy 11:14</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/5-24.htm">Jeremiah 5:24</a>; <a href="/hosea/6-3.htm">Hosea 6:3</a>; <a href="/joel/2-23.htm">Joel 2:23</a>; <a href="/zechariah/10-1.htm">Zechariah 10:1</a>; <a href="/james/5-7.htm">James 5:7</a>).

Among moderns, only Umbr. and Schlottm. adopt this signification; Bttch. and Welte, after the example of Cocceius, Tingstad, and others, attempt it with the signification "thought  equals  determination;" but most expositors, from Ew. to Hahn, decide in favour of the rendering as simple as it is consistent with the usage of the language and the connection: His noise (&#1512;&#1506;&#1493; as <a href="/exodus/32-17.htm">Exodus 32:17</a>) gives tidings concerning Him (announces Him). In <a href="/job/36-33.htm">Job 36:33</a> Theod. (lxx), Syr., and Jer. point &#1502;&#1511;&#1504;&#1492; like our text, but translate possessio, with which we can do nothing. It seems that in the three attempts of the Targ. to translate <a href="//biblehub.com/job/36-33.htm">Job 36:33</a>, the translators had &#1511;&#1504;&#1488;&#1492; and &#1511;&#1504;&#1468;&#1488; before their mind, according to which Hahn translates: the arousing of anger (announces) the comer, which assumes &#1502;&#1511;&#1504;&#1492; instead of &#1502;&#1511;&#1504;&#1492;; and Schlottm.: fierce wrath (goes forth) over evil (according to Symm. &#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;), which assumes the reading &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492; (&#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492;), &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;, adopted also by Syr., Theod. (lxx). Schultens even renders similarly: rubedinem flammantem nasi contra elatum, and Tingstad: zelum irae in iniquitatem. But it is not probable that the language was acquainted with a subst. &#1502;&#1511;&#1504;&#1492;, exciting, although in <a href="/ezekiel/8-3.htm">Ezekiel 8:3</a> &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1511;&#1504;&#1492; is equivalent to &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1511;&#1504;&#1497;&#1488;, so that one might more readily be tempted (vid., Hitz. in loc.) to read &#1502;&#1511;&#1504;&#1492; &#1488;&#1507;, "one who excites anger against evil," it one is not willing to decide with Berg, and recently Bleek, in favour of (&#1502;&#1511;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;) &#1502;&#1511;&#1504;&#1468;&#1488; &#1488;&#1507; &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492;, excandescens (zelans) ira equals  contra iniquitatem. But does the text as it stands really not give an appropriate idea? Aben-Ezra and Duran have understood it of the foreboding of an approaching thunder-storm which is manifested by cattle, &#1502;&#1511;&#1504;&#1492;. Accordingly Ew. translates: His thunder announces Him, the cattle even, that He is approaching; and peculiarly new (understanding &#1497;&#1490;&#1497;&#1491; not of a foreboding but of a thankful lowing) is Ebrard's rendering; also the cattle at fresh sprouting grass. But such a change of the position of &#1488;&#1507; is without precedent. Hirz. and Ges.: His rumble (rumble of thunder) announces Him to the herds, Him, and indeed as Him who rises up (approaches). But this new interpunction destroys the division of the verse and the syntax. Better Rosenm. like Duran: pecus non tantum pluviam proximam, sed et antequam nubes in sublime adscenderint adscensuras praesagit, according to Virgil, Georg. i.:374f.:<p>illum (imbrem) surgentem vallibus imis<p>Aeriae fugere grues.<p>But &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; refers to God, and therefore &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492; also, viz., Him who leads forth the storm-clouds (<a href="/jeremiah/10-13.htm">Jeremiah 10:13</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/51-16.htm">Jeremiah 51:16</a>; <a href="/psalms/135-7.htm">Psalm 135:7</a>), and Himself rising up in them; or, what &#1506;&#1500;&#1492; frequently signifies, coming on as to battle. It is to be interpreted: His thunder-clap announces Him (who is about to reveal Himself as a merciful judge), the cattle even (announce) Him at His first rising up, since at the approach of a storm they herd together affrighted and seek shelter. The speakers are Arabian, and the scene is laid in the country: Elihu also refers to the animal world in <a href="/job/35-11.htm">Job 35:11</a>; this feature of the picture, therefore, cannot be surprising. </body></html>
