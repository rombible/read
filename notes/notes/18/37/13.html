Such methods they are by which the ground may, at any time, be cursed, and the toil and labour of men increased to what degree God thinks fit.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/job/37.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>37:1-13 The changes of the weather are the subject of a great deal of our thoughts and common talk; but how seldom do we think and speak of these things, as Elihu, with a regard to God, the director of them! We must notice the glory of God, not only in the thunder and lightning, but in the more common and less awful changes of the weather; as the snow and rain. Nature directs all creatures to shelter themselves from a storm; and shall man only be unprovided with a refuge? Oh that men would listen to the voice of God, who in many ways warns them to flee from the wrath to come; and invites them to accept his salvation, and to be happy. The ill opinion which men entertain of the Divine direction, peculiarly appears in their murmurs about the weather, though the whole result of the year proves the folly of their complaints. Believers should avoid this; no days are bad as God makes them, though we make many bad by our sins.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/37.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He causeth it to come - That is, the rain, or the storm.

The rod is often used as an emblem of punishment. The idea is, that God, when he pleases, can send the rain upon the earth for the purpose of executing punishment. So he did on the old world <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/7-11.htm">Genesis 7:11-12</a>, and so the overflowing flood is often now sent to sweep away the works of man, to lay waste his fields, and to cut off the wicked.<p>Or for his land - When necessary to render the land productive.

It is called "his land," meaning that the earth belongs to the Lord, and that he cultivates it as his own; <a href="/psalms/24-1.htm">Psalm 24:1</a>.<p>Or for mercy - In kindness and benignity to the world. But for this, the earth would become baked and parched, and all vegetation would expire. The idea is, that the rains are entirely under the control of God, and that he can make use of them to accomplish his various purposes - to execute his judgments, or to express his benignity and love. These various uses to which the lightning, the storm, and the rain could be made subservient under the divine direction. seem to have been one of the main ideas in the mind of Elihu, showing the supremacy and the majesty of God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/37.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. Literally, "He maketh it (the rain-cloud) find place," whether for correction, if (it be destined) for His land (that is, for the part inhabited by man, with whom God deals, as opposed to the parts uninhabited, on which rain is at other times appointed to fall, Job 38:26, 27) or for mercy. "If it be destined for His land" is a parenthetical supposition [Maurer]. In English Version, this clause spoils the even balance of the antithesis between the "rod" (Margin) and "mercy" (Ps 68:9; Ge 7:1-24).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/job/37.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">He causeth it to come, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">he maketh it</span> (to wit, the cloud, or clouds, and the rain which is in it) <span class="ital">to find</span>, to wit, a path, or to find out the persons or place to which God intends either good or hurt by it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">For correction, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">for a rod</span>, to scourge or correct men by immoderate showers.

Thence next ha&#770;wijatun, &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1; &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, i.e., &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;  equals  hu&#770;watun, uhw&#305;&#770;jatun, huwa&#770;atun, mahwa&#770;tun, a cleft, yawning deep, chasm, abyss, &#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, vorago; haw&#305;&#770;jatun and hauha&#770;tun (a reduplicated form), especially a very deep pit or well. But these same words, ha&#770;wijatun, hu&#770;watun, uhw&#305;&#770;jatun, mahwa&#770;tun, also signify, like the usual Arab. hawa'a&#770;'un, the &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; between heaven and earth, i.e., the wide, empty space, the same as 'gauwun. The wider significations, or rather applications and references of hawa&#770;: air set in motion, a current of air, wind, weather, are all secondary, and related to that primary signification as sama&#770;, rain-clouds, rain, grass produced by the rain, to the prim. signification height, heaven, vid., Mehren, Rhetorik d. Araber, S. 107, Z. 14ff. This hawa&#770;, however, also signifies in general: a broad, empty space, and by transferring the notion of "empty" to mind and heart, as the reduplicated forms hu&#770;hatun and hauha&#770;tun: devoid of understanding and devoid of courage, e.g., Koran xiv. 44: wa-af'i-datuhum hawa&#770;un, where Bedhw first explains hawa&#770; directly by chala&#770;, emptiness, empty space, i.e., as he adds, cha&#770;lijetun &#8219;an el-fahm, as one says of one without mind and courage qalbuhu hawa&#770;un. Thence also hauwun, emptiness, a hole, i.e., in a wall or roof, a dormar-window (kauwe, ku&#770;we), but also with the genit. of a person or thing: their hole, i.e., the space left empty by them, the side not taken up by them, e.g., qa&#8219;ada fi hauwihi, he set himself beside him. From the signification to be empty then comes (1) hawat el-mar'atu, i.e., vacua fuit mulier  equals  orba oiberis, as &#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;, vidua, properly empty, French vide; (2) hawa&#770; er-ragulu, i.e., vacuus, inanis factus est vir  equals  exanimatus (comp. Arab. frg, he became empty, euphemistic for he died).<p>From this variously applied primary signification is developed the generally known and usual Arab. hawa&#770;, loose and free, without being held or holding to anything one's self, to pass away, fly, swing, etc., libere ferri, labi, in general in every direction, as the wind, or what is driven hither and thither by the wind, especially however from above downwards, labi, delabi, cadere, deorsum ruere. From this point, like many similar, the word first passes into the signification of sound (as certainly also &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1492;, &#1513;&#1488;): as anything falling has a full noise, and so on, &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;, rumorem, fragorem edere (fragor from frangi), hence hawat udhnuhu jaw&#305;&#770;jan of a singing in the ears.<p>continued...</body></html>
