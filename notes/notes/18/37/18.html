Elihu here speaks of the sky as it appears, and as it is often spoken of, as an expanse or solid body spread out over our heads, and as sustained by some cause which is unknown. Sometimes in the Scriptures it is spoken of as a curtain (Notes, <a href="/isaiah/40-22.htm">Isaiah 40:22</a>); sometimes as a "firmament," or a solid body spread out (Septuagint, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/1-6.htm">Genesis 1:6-7</a>); sometimes as a fixture in which the stars are placed (Notes, <a href="/isaiah/34-4.htm">Isaiah 34:4</a>), and sometimes as a scroll that may be rolled up, or as a garment, <a href="/psalms/102-26.htm">Psalm 102:26</a>. There is no reason to suppose that the true cause of the appearance of an expanse was understood at that time, but probably the prevailing impression was that the sky was solid and was a fixture in which the stars were held. Many of the ancients supposed that there were concentric spheres, which were transparent but solid, and that these spheres revolved around the earth carrying the heavenly bodies with them. In one of these spheres, they supposed, was the sun; in another the moon; in another the fixed stars; in another the planets; and it was the harmonious movement of these concentric and transparent orbs which it was supposed produced the "music of the spheres."<p>Which is strong - Firm, compact. Elihu evidently supposed that it was solid. It was so firm that it was self-sustained.<p>And as a molten looking-glass - As a mirror that is made by being fused or cast. The word "glass" is not in the original, the Hebrew denoting simply "seeing," or a "mirror" (&#1512;&#1488;&#1497;  re'&#305;&#770;y). Mirrors were commonly made of plates of metal highly polished; see the notes at <a href="/isaiah/3-23.htm">Isaiah 3:23</a>; compare Wilkinson's Manners and Customs of the Ancient Egyptians, vol. iii. p. 365. Ancient mirrors were so highly polished that in some which have been discovered at Thebes the luster has been partially restored, though they have been buried for many centuries. There can be no doubt that the early apprehension in regard to the sky was, that it was a solid expanse, and that it is often so spoken of in the Bible. There is, however, no direct declaration that it is so, and whenever it is so spoken of, it is to be understood as popular language, as we speak still of the rising or setting of the sun, though we know that the language is not philosophically correct. The design of the Bible is not to teach science, but religion, and the speakers in the Bible were allowed to use the language of common life - just as scientific men in fact do now. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/37.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18. with him&#8212;like as He does (Job 40:15).<p>spread out&#8212;given expanse to.<p>strong pieces&#8212;firm; whence the term "firmament" ("expansion," Ge 1:6, Margin; Isa 44:24).<p>molten looking glass&#8212;image of the bright smiling sky.

The translation, "looking-glass," is wrong, both here and in <a href="/exodus/38-8.htm">Exodus 38:8</a>, since glass was not used for mirrors until the period of the early Roman empire.

The old versions connect &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497; partly with &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;, electus (lxx, Syr., Theod.) or frumentum (Symm., Jer.), partly with &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492;  equals  &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1512; in the signification puritas, serenitas (Targ.); but &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497; is, as Schultens has already perceived, the Hebr.-Arabic &#1512;&#1497;, Arab. r&#305;&#770;yun, r&#305;&#770;j-un (from &#1512;&#1493;&#1492;  equals  riwj), abundant irrigation, with &#1489;&#1468;; and &#1497;&#1496;&#1512;&#1497;&#1495; does not signify, according to the Arab. atraha, "to hurl down," so that what is spoken of would be the bursting of the clouds (Stick.), <p>(Note: This "atraha" is, moreover, a pure invention of our ordinary Arabic lexicons instead of ittaraha (VIII form): (1) to throw one's self, (2) to throw anything from one's self, with an acc. of the thing. - Fl.)<p>but, according to &#1496;&#1512;&#1495;, a burden (comp. Arab. taraha ala, to load), "to burden;" with fluidity (Ew., Hirz., Hahn, Schlottm.), better: fulness of water, He burdens the clouds (comp. rawij-un as a designation of cloud as the place of rain). &#1506;&#1504;&#1503; &#1488;&#1493;&#1512;&#1493;, His cloud of light, is that that is charged with lightning, and &#1492;&#1508;&#1497;&#1509; has here its Hebr.-Arab. radical signification effundere, diffundere, with a preponderance of the idea not of scattering, but of spreading out wide (Arab. faid, abundance). &#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/37-12.htm">Job 37:12</a>, refers to the cloud pregnant with lightning; this turns round about (&#1502;&#1505;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, adv. as &#1502;&#1505;&#1489;, round about, <a href="/1_kings/6-29.htm">1 Kings 6:29</a>) seeking a place, where it shall unburden itself by virtue of His (God's) direction or disposing (&#1514;&#1495;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;, a word belonging to the book of Proverbs; lxx, Cod.

The reference of the pronominal suff. to men is as inadmissible here as in <a href="/job/37-4.htm">Job 37:4</a>. In <a href="/job/37-13.htm">Job 37:13</a> two &#1488;&#1501; have certainly, as <a href="//biblehub.com/job/34-29.htm">Job 34:29</a>, two &#1493;, the correlative signification sive ... sive (Arab. in ... wa-in), in a third, as appears, a conditional, but which? According to Ew., Hirz., Hahn, Schlottm., and others, the middle one: if it (the rod) belongs to His land, i.e., if it has deserved it. But even the possessive suff. of &#1500;&#1488;&#1512;&#1510;&#1493; shows that the &#1500; is to be taken as dat. commodi: be it for a rod, be it for the good of His land; which is then followed by a conditional verbal clause: in case He mercifully causes it (the storm) to come, i.e., causes this His land to be overtaken by it (&#1492;&#1502;&#1510;&#1497;&#1488; here with the acc., the thing coming, whereas in <a href="/job/34-11.htm">Job 34:11</a> of the thing to be overtaken). The accentuation, indeed, appears to assume a threefold sive: whether He causeth it to discharge itself upon man for punishment, man for mercy, or His earth for good with reference to man. Then Elihu would think of the uninhabited steppe in connection with &#1488;&#1501; &#1500;&#1488;&#1512;&#1510;&#1493;. Since a conditional &#1488;&#1501; by the side of two correlatives is hazardous, we decide finally with the lxx, Targ., and all the old versions, in favour of the same rendering of the threefold &#1488;&#1501;, especially since it corresponds to the circumstances of the case. </body></html>
