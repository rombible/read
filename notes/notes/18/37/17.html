As God has a powerful, freezing north wind, so he has a thawing, composing south wind: the Spirit is compared to both, because he both convinces and comforts, So 4:16. The best of men are much in the dark concerning the glorious perfections of the Divine nature and the Divine government. Those who, through grace, know much of God, know nothing, in comparison with what is to be known, and of what will be known, when that which is perfect is come.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/37.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>How thy garments are warm - What is the reason that the garments which we wear produce warmth? This, it would seem, was one of the philosophical questions which were asked at that time, and which it was difficult to explain. Perhaps it has never occurred to most persons to ask this apparently simple question, and if the inquiry were proposed to them, plain as it seems to be, they would find it as difficult to give an answer as Elihu supposed it would be for Job. Of the fact here referred to that the garments became oppressive when a sultry wind came from the south, there could be no dispute. But what was the precise difficulty in explaining the fact, is not so clear. Some suppose that Elihu asks this question sarcastically, as meaning that Job could not explain the simplest matters and the plainest facts; but there is every reason to think that the question was proposed with entire seriousness, and that it was supposed to involve real difficulty. It seems probable that the difficulty was not so much to explain why the garments should become oppressive in a burning or sultry atmosphere, as to show how the heated air itself was produced It was difficult to explain why cold came out of the north <a href="/job/37-9.htm">Job 37:9</a>; how the clouds were suspended, and the lightnings caused <a href="//biblehub.com/job/37-11.htm">Job 37:11</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/37-15.htm">Job 37:15-16</a>; and it was not less difficult to show what produced uncomfortable heat when the storms from the north were allayed; when the earth became quiet, and when the breezes blowed from the south. This would be a fair question for investigation, and we may readily suppose that the causes then were not fully known.<p>When he quieteth the earth - When the piercing blast from the north dies away, and the wind comes round to the south, producing a more gentle, but a sultry air. It was true not only that the whirlwind came from the south <a href="//biblehub.com/job/37-9.htm">Job 37:9</a>, but also that the heated burning air came also from that quarter, <a href="/luke/12-55.htm">Luke 12:55</a>. We know the reason to be that the equatorial regions are warmer than those at the north, and especially that in the regions where <a href="//biblehub.com/job/54.htm">Job 54</a>ed the air becomes heated by passing over extended plains of sand, but there is no reason to suppose that this was fully understood at the time referred to here. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/37.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17. thy garments, &c.&#8212;that is, dost thou know how thy body grows warm, so as to affect thy garments with heat?<p>south wind&#8212;literally, "region of the south."

One should think there is no great difficulty in accounting for this, that a man's clothes should be warm, and he so hot as not to be able to bear them, but obliged to put them off in the summer season, when only the south wind blows, which brings heat, a serene sky, and fine weather, <a href="/luke/12-55.htm">Luke 12:55</a>; and yet there is something in the concourse of divine Providence attending these natural causes, and his blessing with them, without which the garment of a man will not be warm, or at least not warming to him, <a href="/haggai/1-6.htm">Haggai 1:6</a>; or <p>"how thy garments are warm when the land is still from the south,'' <p>as Mr. Broughton renders the words; that is, how it is when the earth is still from the whirlwinds of the south; or when that wind does not blow which brings heat, but northerly winds in the winter time; that then a man's garments should be warm, and keep him warm. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/37.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">How thy garments <i>are</i> <span class="cverse3">{n}</span> warm, when he quieteth the earth by the south <i>wind</i>?</span><p>(n) Why your clothes should keep you warm when the south wind blows rather than when any other wind blows?</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/job/37.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">17</span>. <span class="ital">how thy garments are warm</span>] Rather perhaps, <span class="bld">thou Whose garments are warm, when the earth is still because of the south wind</span>. <a href="/job/37-15.htm" title="Do you know when God disposed them, and caused the light of his cloud to shine?">Job 37:15</a> referred to the storm cloud; <span class="ital"><a href="/context/job/37-16.htm" title="Do you know the balancing of the clouds, the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge?...">Job 37:16-17</a></span> refer rather to the sultry summer cloud.

In reference to the <span class="ital">stillness</span> of the earth under such a wind, this writer says, “There is no living thing abroad to make a noise.

The old versions connect &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497; partly with &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;, electus (lxx, Syr., Theod.) or frumentum (Symm., Jer.), partly with &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492;  equals  &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1512; in the signification puritas, serenitas (Targ.); but &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497; is, as Schultens has already perceived, the Hebr.-Arabic &#1512;&#1497;, Arab. r&#305;&#770;yun, r&#305;&#770;j-un (from &#1512;&#1493;&#1492;  equals  riwj), abundant irrigation, with &#1489;&#1468;; and &#1497;&#1496;&#1512;&#1497;&#1495; does not signify, according to the Arab. atraha, "to hurl down," so that what is spoken of would be the bursting of the clouds (Stick.), <p>(Note: This "atraha" is, moreover, a pure invention of our ordinary Arabic lexicons instead of ittaraha (VIII form): (1) to throw one's self, (2) to throw anything from one's self, with an acc. of the thing. - Fl.)<p>but, according to &#1496;&#1512;&#1495;, a burden (comp. Arab. taraha ala, to load), "to burden;" with fluidity (Ew., Hirz., Hahn, Schlottm.), better: fulness of water, He burdens the clouds (comp. rawij-un as a designation of cloud as the place of rain). &#1506;&#1504;&#1503; &#1488;&#1493;&#1512;&#1493;, His cloud of light, is that that is charged with lightning, and &#1492;&#1508;&#1497;&#1509; has here its Hebr.-Arab. radical signification effundere, diffundere, with a preponderance of the idea not of scattering, but of spreading out wide (Arab. faid, abundance). &#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/37-12.htm">Job 37:12</a>, refers to the cloud pregnant with lightning; this turns round about (&#1502;&#1505;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, adv. as &#1502;&#1505;&#1489;, round about, <a href="/1_kings/6-29.htm">1 Kings 6:29</a>) seeking a place, where it shall unburden itself by virtue of His (God's) direction or disposing (&#1514;&#1495;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;, a word belonging to the book of Proverbs; lxx, Cod.

The reference of the pronominal suff. to men is as inadmissible here as in <a href="/job/37-4.htm">Job 37:4</a>. In <a href="/job/37-13.htm">Job 37:13</a> two &#1488;&#1501; have certainly, as <a href="//biblehub.com/job/34-29.htm">Job 34:29</a>, two &#1493;, the correlative signification sive ... sive (Arab. in ... wa-in), in a third, as appears, a conditional, but which? According to Ew., Hirz., Hahn, Schlottm., and others, the middle one: if it (the rod) belongs to His land, i.e., if it has deserved it. But even the possessive suff. of &#1500;&#1488;&#1512;&#1510;&#1493; shows that the &#1500; is to be taken as dat. commodi: be it for a rod, be it for the good of His land; which is then followed by a conditional verbal clause: in case He mercifully causes it (the storm) to come, i.e., causes this His land to be overtaken by it (&#1492;&#1502;&#1510;&#1497;&#1488; here with the acc., the thing coming, whereas in <a href="/job/34-11.htm">Job 34:11</a> of the thing to be overtaken). The accentuation, indeed, appears to assume a threefold sive: whether He causeth it to discharge itself upon man for punishment, man for mercy, or His earth for good with reference to man. Then Elihu would think of the uninhabited steppe in connection with &#1488;&#1501; &#1500;&#1488;&#1512;&#1510;&#1493;. Since a conditional &#1488;&#1501; by the side of two correlatives is hazardous, we decide finally with the lxx, Targ., and all the old versions, in favour of the same rendering of the threefold &#1488;&#1501;, especially since it corresponds to the circumstances of the case. </body></html>
