And this, they suppose, might occasion Elihu’s return to that subject, of which he had discoursed before. Bishop Patrick thus paraphrases this verse: “Hearken, I beseech you, seriously to the horrible noise which comes out of some of those clouds, and it will astonish you also. The smallest murmurs of it are so dreadful, that it may be fitly styled the voice of God calling men to stand in awe of him.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/job/37.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>37:1-13 The changes of the weather are the subject of a great deal of our thoughts and common talk; but how seldom do we think and speak of these things, as Elihu, with a regard to God, the director of them! We must notice the glory of God, not only in the thunder and lightning, but in the more common and less awful changes of the weather; as the snow and rain. Nature directs all creatures to shelter themselves from a storm; and shall man only be unprovided with a refuge? Oh that men would listen to the voice of God, who in many ways warns them to flee from the wrath to come; and invites them to accept his salvation, and to be happy. The ill opinion which men entertain of the Divine direction, peculiarly appears in their murmurs about the weather, though the whole result of the year proves the folly of their complaints. Believers should avoid this; no days are bad as God makes them, though we make many bad by our sins.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/37.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Hear attentively - Margin, as in Hebrew "hear in hearing;" that is, bear with attention. It has been supposed by many, and not without probability, that the tempest was already seen rising, out of which God was to address Job J<a href="//biblehub.com/obadiah/38.htm">Obadiah 38</a>, and that Elihu here calls the special attention of his hearers to the gathering storm, and to the low muttering thunder in the distance.<p>The noise of his voice - Thunder is often represented as the voice of God, and this was one of the most natural of all suppositions when its nature was little understood, and is at all times a beautiful poetic conception; see the whole of <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/29-1.htm">Psalm 29:1-11</a>. The word rendered "noise" (&#1512;&#1490;&#1494;  ro&#770;gez), means properly "commotion," that which is fitted to produce perturbation, or disquiet (see <a href="//biblehub.com/job/3-17.htm">Job 3:17</a>, <a href="/job/3-26.htm">Job 3:26</a>; <a href="/isaiah/14-3.htm">Isaiah 14:3</a>), and is used here to denote the commotion, or "raging" of thunder.<p>And the sound - The word used here (&#1492;&#1490;&#1492;  hegeh) means properly a "muttering growling" - as of thunder. It is often used to denote sighing, moaning, and meditation, in contradistinction from clear enunciation.

Now the voice of God, whether in his works of nature, or in the dispensations of his providence, or in his word; whether in the thunder of the law, or in the still sound of the Gospel, is to be attentively hearkened to; because it is the voice of God, the voice of the God of glory, majestic and powerful, and is attended with various effects; of which see <a href="/psalms/29-3.htm">Psalm 29:3</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/37.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Hear attentively the <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> noise of his voice, and the sound <i>that</i> goeth out of his mouth.</span><p>(b) That is the thunder, by which he speaks to men to waken their dullness, and to bring them to the consideration of his works.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/job/37.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2</span>. <span class="ital">the sound that goeth</span>] Or, <span class="ital">the muttering</span>.

"If Job had only come," says a Midrash (Jalkut, 518), "to explain to us the matter of the race of the deluge (vid., especially <a href="//biblehub.com/job/22-15.htm">Job 22:15-18</a>), it had been sufficient; and if Elihu had only come to explain to us the matter of the origin of rain (&#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1491;&#1514; &#1490;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;), it had been enough." In Gesenius' Handwrterbuch, <a href="/job/36-27.htm">Job 36:27</a> is translated: when He has drawn up the drops of water to Himself, then, etc. But it is &#1497;&#1490;&#1512;&#1506;, not &#1490;&#1468;&#1512;&#1506;; and &#1490;&#1468;&#1512;&#1506; neither in Hebr. nor in Arab. signifies attrahere in sublime (Rosenm.), but only attrahere (root &#1490;&#1512;) and detrahere; the latter signification is the prevailing one in Hebr. (<a href="/job/15-8.htm">Job 15:8</a>; <a href="/job/36-7.htm">Job 36:7</a>). With &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; the transcendent exaltation of the Being who survives all changes of creation is shown by an example: He draws away (draws off, as it were) the water-drops, viz., from the waters that are confined above on the circle of the sky, which pass over us as mist and cloud (vid., Genesis, S. 107); and these water-drops distil down (&#1494;&#1511;&#1511;, to ooze, distil, here not in a transitive but an intransitive signification, since the water-drops are the rain itself) as rain, &#1500;&#1488;&#1491;&#1493;, with its mist, i.e., since a mist produced by it (<a href="/genesis/2-6.htm">Genesis 2:6</a>) fills the expanse (&#1512;&#1511;&#1497;&#1506;), the downfall of which is just this rain, which, as <a href="/job/36-28.htm">Job 36:28</a> says, the clouds (called &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501; on account of its thin strata of air, in distinction from the next mist-circle) cause to flow gently down upon the multitude of men, i.e., far and wide over the mass of men who inhabit the district visited by the rain; both verbs are used transitively here, both &#1504;&#1494;&#1500; as <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/45-8.htm">Isaiah 45:8</a>, and &#1512;&#1506;&#1507;, as evidently <a href="/proverbs/3-20.htm">Proverbs 3:20</a>. &#1488;&#1507; &#1488;&#1501;, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/36-29.htm">Job 36:29</a>, commences an intensive question: moreover, could one understand  equals  could one completely understand; which certainly, according to the sense, is equivalent to: how much less (&#1488;&#1507; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;). &#1488;&#1501; is, however, the interrogative an, and &#1488;&#1507; &#1488;&#1501; corresponds to &#1492;&#1488;&#1507; in the first member of the double question, <a href="/job/34-17.htm">Job 34:17</a>; <a href="/job/40-8.htm">Job 40:8</a>. &#1502;&#1508;&#1512;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497; are not the burstings, from &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1474;  equals  &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1505;, frangere, findere, but spreadings, as <a href="/ezekiel/27-7.htm">Ezekiel 27:7</a> shows, from &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1474;, expandere, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/105-39.htm">Psalm 105:39</a>, comp. supra on <a href="/job/36-9.htm">Job 36:9</a>.
