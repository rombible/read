In the original there is a very manifest play on the words, which it is impossible to preserve, between yĕre’u and yireh—<span class= "ital">men shall fear, but none shall see.</span><p><span class= "bld"><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/job/37.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>37:21-24 Elihu concludes his discourse with some great sayings concerning the glory of God. Light always is, but is not always to be seen. When clouds come between, the sun is darkened in the clear day. The light of God's favour shines ever towards his faithful servants, though it be not always seen. Sins are clouds, and often hinder us from seeing that bright light which is in the face of God. Also, as to those thick clouds of sorrow which often darken our minds, the Lord hath a wind which passes and clears them away. What is that wind? It is his Holy Spirit. As the wind dispels and sweeps away the clouds which are gathered in the air, so the Spirit of God clears our souls from the clouds and fogs of ignorance and unbelief, of sin and lust. From all these clouds the Holy Spirit of God frees us in the work of regeneration. And from all the clouds which trouble our consciences, the Holy Spirit sets us free in the work of consolation. Now that God is about to speak, Elihu delivers a few words, as the sum of all his discourse. With God is terrible majesty. Sooner or later all men shall fear him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/37.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Men do therefore fear him - There is reason why they should fear him, or why they should treat him with reverence.<p>He respecteth not any that are wise of heart - He pursues his own plans, and forms and executes his own counsels. He is not dependent upon the suggestions of people, and does not listen to their advice. In his schemes he is original and independent, and people should therefore regard him with profound veneration. This is the sum of all that Elihu had to say - that God was original and independent; that he did not ask counsel of people in his dealings; that he was great, and glorious, and inscrutable in his plans; and that people therefore should bow before him with profound submission and adoration. It was to be presumed that he was wise and good in all that he did, and to this independent and almighty Sovereign man ought to submit his understanding and his heart. Having illustrated and enforced this sentiment, Elihu, overwhelmed with the awful symbols of the approaching Deity, is silent, and God is introduced to close the controversy. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/37.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24. do&#8212;rather, "ought."<p>wise&#8212;in their own conceits.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/job/37.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Men do therefore fear him; </span> for this cause, to wit, because of God’s infinite and excellent perfections, and especially those mentioned in the foregoing verse, <span class="ital">men do or should</span> (for the future tense is oft used potentially, as Hebricians know) <span class="ital">fear</span> or <span class="ital">reverence him</span>, and humbly submit to him, and not presume to quarrel or dispute with him, as thou, O Job, hast done. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">He respecteth not, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">he doth not</span>, or <span class="ital">will not behold</span>, to wit, with respect or approbation; he beholdeth them afar off with scorn and contempt. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Any that are wise of heart, </span> i. e. such as are wise in their own eyes, that lean to their own understandings, and despise all other men in comparison of themselves, and scorn all their counsels; that are so puffed up with the opinion of their own wisdom, that they dare contend with their Maker, and presume to censure his counsels and actions; which he hereby intimates to be Job’s fault, and to be the true reason why God did not respect nor regard him, nor his prayers and tears, as Job complained.
