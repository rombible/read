As we cannot find fault with God's work, so we need not fear concerning it. The works of his providence, as well as the work of creation, never can be broken; and the work of redemption is no less firm, of which Christ himself is both the Foundation and the Corner-stone. The church stands as firm as the earth.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/38.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And said, Hitherto shalt thou come - This is a most sublime expression, and its full force can be felt only by one who has stood on the shores of the ocean, and seen its mighty waves roll toward the beach as if in their pride they would sweep everything away, and how they are checked by the barrier which God has made. A voice seems to say to them that they may roll in their pride and grandeur so far, but no further. No increase of their force or numbers can sweep the barrier away, or make any impression on the limits which God has fixed.<p>And here shall they proud waves be stayed - Margin, as in Hebrew, "the pride of thy waves." A beautiful image. The waves seem to advance in pride and self-confidence, as if nothing could stay them. They come as if exulting in the assurance that they will sweep everything away. In a moment they are arrested and broken, and they spread out humbly and harmlessly on the beach. God fixes the limit or boundary which they are not to pass, and they lie prostrate at his feet. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/38.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. stayed&#8212;Hebrew, "a limit shall be set to."<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/job/38.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> To wit, at the sand and shore of the sea, <span class="bld"><a href="/jeremiah/5-22.htm" title="Fear you not me? said the LORD: will you not tremble at my presence, which have placed the sand for the bound of the sea by a perpetual decree, that it cannot pass it: and though the waves thereof toss themselves, yet can they not prevail; though they roar, yet can they not pass over it?">Jeremiah 5:22</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Thy proud waves; </span> which rage and swell as if they would overwhelm all the earth. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/job/38.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And said, hitherto shalt thou come, but no further,....

The law is not quite absolute. Wherever the sea washes a coast-line, there is a continual erosive action, whereby the land is, little by little, eaten away, and the line of the coast thrust back. But the action is so slow that millennia pass without any considerable effect being produced, and encroachments in some places are generally counterbalanced by retrenchment in others, so that the general contour of laud and water, with the proportion of the one to the other, remain probably very much the same at the present day as when the earth first became the habitation of man. <span class="cmt_word">And here shall thy proud waves be stayed</span>. The waves of the sea "rage horribly," and every now and then topple down a rock or undermine a cliff, and seem proud of their achievements; but how little do they effect, even in thousands of years! The little islet of Psyttaleia still blocks the eastern end of the straits of Salamis. The Pharos island lies off the westernmost mouth of the Nile. Even the low, fiat Aradus, on the Syrian coast, has not been swept away. Everywhere the waves are practically "stayed," and all the menaces of the sea against the land come to nought. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/38.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>  4  Where wast thou when I established the earth?<p>Say, if thou art capable of judging!<p>  5  Who hath determined its measure, if thou knowest it,<p>Or who hath stretched the measuring line over it?<p>  6  Upon what are the bases of its pillars sunk in,<p>Or who hath laid its corner-stone,<p>  7  When the morning stars sang together<p>And all the sons of God shouted for joy?<p>The examination begins similarly to <a href="/job/15-7.htm">Job 15:7</a>. In opposition to the censurer of God as such the friends were right, although only negatively, since their conduct was based on self-delusion, as though they were in possession of the key to the mystery of the divine government of the world. &#1497;&#1491;&#1506; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492; signifies to understand how to judge, to possess a competent understanding, <a href="/1_chronicles/12-32.htm">1 Chronicles 12:32</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-12.htm">2 Chronicles 2:12</a>, or (&#1497;&#1491;&#1506; taken not in the sense of novisse, but cognoscere) to appropriate to one's self, <a href="/proverbs/4-1.htm">Proverbs 4:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/29-24.htm">Isaiah 29:24</a>. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/38-5.htm">Job 38:5</a>, interchanges with &#1488;&#1501; (comp. <a href="/job/38-18.htm">Job 38:18</a>), for &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1514;&#1491;&#1506; signifies: suppose that thou knowest it, and this si forte scias is almost equivalent to an forte scis, <a href="/proverbs/30-4.htm">Proverbs 30:4</a>. The founding of the earth is likened altogether to that of a building constructed by man. The question: upon what are the bases of its pillars or foundations sunk (&#1496;&#1489;&#1506;, Arab. t&#803;b&#8219;, according to its radical signification, to press with something flat upon something, comp. Arab. t&#803;bq, to lay two flat things on one another, then both to form or stamp by pressure, and to press into soft pliant stuff, or let down into, immergere, or to sink into, immergi), points to the fact of the earth hanging free in space, <a href="/job/26-7.htm">Job 26:7</a>. Then no human being was present, for man was not yet created; the angels, however, beheld with rejoicing the founding of the place of the future human family, and the mighty acts of God in accordance with the decree of His love (as at the building of the temple, the laying of the foundation, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/3-10.htm">Ezra 3:10</a>, and the setting of the head-stone, <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/4-7.htm">Zechariah 4:7</a>, were celebrated), for the angels were created before the visible world (Psychol. S. 63; Genesis, S. 105), as is indeed not taught here, but still (vid., on the other hand, Hofmann, Schriftbew. i. 400) is assumed. For &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; are, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/1.htm">Job 1-2</a>, the angels, who proceeded from God by a mode of creation which is likened to begetting, and who with Him form one &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769; (Genesis, S. 121). The "morning stars," however, are mentioned in connection with them, because between the stars and the angels, which are both comprehended in &#1510;&#1489;&#1488; &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; (Genesis, S. 128), a mysterious connection exists, which is manifoldly attested in Holy Scripture (vid., on the other hand, Hofm. ib. S. 318). &#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1499;&#1489; &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512; is the morning star which in <a href="/isaiah/14-12.htm">Isaiah 14:12</a> is called &#1492;&#1497;&#1500;&#1500; (as extra-bibl. &#1504;&#1490;&#1492;&#1468;) from its dazzling light, which exceeds all other stars in brightness, and &#1489;&#1468;&#1503;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1512;, son of the dawn, because it swims in the dawn as though it were born from it. It was just the dawn of the world coming into being, which is the subject spoken of, that gave rise to the mention of the morning star; the plur., however, does not mean the stars which came into being on that morning of the world collectively (Hofm., Schlottm.), but Lucifer with the stars his peers, as &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/13-10.htm">Isaiah 13:10</a>, Orion and the stars his peers. Arab. suhayl (Canopus) is used similarly as a generic name for stars of remarkable brilliancy, and in general suhe&#770;l is to the nomads and the Hauranites the symbol of what is brilliant, glorious, and beautiful; <p>(Note: A man or woman of great beauty is called suhe&#770;li, suhel&#305;&#770;je. Thus I heard a Hauranitish woman say to her companion: naha&#770;r el-jo&#770;m neda&#770;, shuft ledsch (Arab. lk) wa&#770;hid Suhe&#770;li, To-day is dew, I saw a Suhe&#770;li, i.e., a very handsome man, for thee. - Wetzst.)<p>so that even the beings of light of the first rank among the celestial spirits might be understood by &#1499;&#1493;&#1499;&#1489;&#1497; &#1489;&#1511;&#1512;. But if this ought to be the meaning, <a href="/job/38-7.htm">Job 38:7</a> and <a href="/job/38-7.htm">Job 38:7</a> would be in an inverted order. They are actual stars, whether it is intended of the sphere belonging to the earth or to the higher sphere comprehended in &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="/genesis/1-1.htm">Genesis 1:1</a>. Joy and light are reciprocal notions, and the scale of the tones of joy is likened to the scale of light and colours; therefore the fulness of light, in which the morning stars shone forth all together at the founding of the earth, may symbolize one grandly harmonious song of joy. </body></html>
