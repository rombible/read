If we thus try ourselves, we shall soon be brought to own that what we know is nothing in comparison with what we know not. By the tender mercy of our God, the Day-spring from on high has visited us, to give light to those that sit in darkness, whose hearts are turned to it as clay to the seal, 2Co 4:6. God's way in the government of the world is said to be in the sea; this means, that it is hid from us. Let us make sure that the gates of heaven shall be opened to us on the other side of death, and then we need not fear the opening of the gates of death. It is presumptuous for us, who perceive not the breadth of the earth, to dive into the depth of God's counsels. We should neither in the brightest noon count upon perpetual day, nor in the darkest midnight despair of the return of the morning; and this applies to our inward as well as to our outward condition. What folly it is to strive against God!

The marvels in heaven. "What is the way (to the place wherein) light dwelleth?" The origin of light and darkness. In Ge 1:3-5, 14-18, "light" is created distinct from, and previous to, light-emitting bodies, the luminaries of heaven.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/job/38.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The way; </span> or rather, <span class="ital">the place</span>, as the next clause explains it, and the Hebrew phrase will bear. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Where light dwelleth, </span> i.e. hath its constant and settled abode; for in the place where Job lived, and in most other parts of the inhabited world, it is like a traveller, that cometh and goeth continually every day. This may be referred either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. To the place under the two poles, where first the light, and then the darkness, continues for six months together. Or rather, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. To the sun, the fountain of light. And as this is a poetical book, so this may be a poetical expression and question, Whither goes the sun, when it departs from this hemisphere? Where is the tabernacle and the chamber in which both sacred, as <span class="bld"><a href="/psalms/19-4.htm" title="Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. In them has he set a tabernacle for the sun,">Psalm 19:4</a>,5</span>, and profane poets suppose the sun to rest? Dost thou know the place where the sun when it sets may be found, and whence thou canst fetch it back again. For it is to be carefully observed, that he speaks not here of a bare and simple knowledge of this matter, which was plain and easy to Job, and many others, who were not ignorant that the sun was the fountain of light, from whose approach light comes, and by whose departure darkness is caused; but of an operative knowledge, even such as could and did enable him to <span class="ital">take it to the bound thereof</span>, as it follows, <span class="bld"><a href="/job/38-20.htm" title="That you should take it to the bound thereof, and that you should know the paths to the house thereof?">Job 38:20</a></span>. And withal, he seems here to speak not only of the daily course and motion of the sun, and the vicissitude of day and night, but also and especially of the first production of the light, which was before Job was born, as is evident from <span class="bld"><a href="/job/38-21.htm" title="Know you it, because you were then born? or because the number of your days is great?">Job 38:21</a></span>. And this makes the question more difficult and more considerable, the sense whereof may be this: Seeing there was a time when there was nothing but gross and comfortless darkness upon the face of the earth, what way came light into the world? which was the place where light dwelt at that time, and whence it was fetched? and whence came that orderly constitution and constant succession of light and darkness? Was this thy work? or wast thou privy to it, or a counsellor or assistant in it? or was it not done by me alone long before thou hadst a being? <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/job/38.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Where is the way where light dwelleth?.... Or the way to the place where it dwells, and what that is; <p>and as for darkness, where is the place thereof? where these were placed when they were first separated at the creation? where light goes and dwells, when it departs from us at sun setting? and where the darkness betakes itself, and makes its abode at sun rising? What is the chamber of the sun, and the tabernacle of it? from whence it sets out, and whither it returns? And though these questions may be answered by geographers and astronomers in their way; yet they seem to respect chiefly the disposal of light and darkness, in such a manner as to cause the revolution of them, and the inequality of days and nights in different seasons and climates; and which is not in the power of men to effect, but depends on the sovereign will of God. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/38.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Where is the way where light dwelleth? and as for darkness, where is the place thereof,</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/job/38.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">19</span>.
