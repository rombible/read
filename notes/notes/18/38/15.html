If we thus try ourselves, we shall soon be brought to own that what we know is nothing in comparison with what we know not. By the tender mercy of our God, the Day-spring from on high has visited us, to give light to those that sit in darkness, whose hearts are turned to it as clay to the seal, 2Co 4:6. God's way in the government of the world is said to be in the sea; this means, that it is hid from us. Let us make sure that the gates of heaven shall be opened to us on the other side of death, and then we need not fear the opening of the gates of death. It is presumptuous for us, who perceive not the breadth of the earth, to dive into the depth of God's counsels. We should neither in the brightest noon count upon perpetual day, nor in the darkest midnight despair of the return of the morning; and this applies to our inward as well as to our outward condition. What folly it is to strive against God! How much is it our interest to seek peace with him, and to keep in his love!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/38.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And from the wicked their light is withholden - While the light thus spreads over the earth, rendering every object beautiful and blessing the righteous, light and prosperity are withheld from the wicked; see the notes at <a href="/job/24-17.htm">Job 24:17</a>. Or, the meaning may be, that when the light shines upon the world, the wicked, accustomed to perform their deeds in the night, flee from it, and retreat to their dark hiding-places.<p>And the high arm - Of the wicked. The arm is a symbol of strength. It is that by which we accomplish our purposes, and the idea here is, that the haughty power of the oppressor shall be crushed. The connection here seems to be this. In <a href="//biblehub.com/job/38-12.htm">Job 38:12-14</a>, there is a beautiful description of the light, and of its effects upon the appearance of natural objects. It was such as to clothe the world with beauty, and to fill the heart of the pious with gladness. In order now to show the greatness of the punishment of the wicked, it is added that all this beauty will be hidden from them. They will be driven away by the light into their dark hiding-places, and will be met there with the withdrawal of all the tokens of prosperity, and their power will be crushed. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/38.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15. their light&#8212;by which they work; namely, darkness, which is their day (Job 24:17), is extinguished by daylight.<p>high&#8212;Rather, "The arm uplifted" for murder or other crime is broken; it falls down suddenly, powerless, through their fear of light.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/job/38.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">And, </span> or <span class="ital">but</span>; for the following words seem to be added by way of opposition to what went before.

The question does not, however, refer to the &#1514;&#1492;&#1493;&#1501;, in which the waters of the sky and the waters of the earth were as yet not separated, but, passing over this intermediate condition of the forming earth, to the sea, the waters of which God shut up as by means of a door and bolt, when, first enshrouded in thick mist (which has remained from that time one of its natural peculiarities), and again and again manifesting its individuality, it broke forth (&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1495; of the foetus, as <a href="/psalms/22-10.htm">Psalm 22:10</a>) from the bowels of the, as yet, chaotic earth. That the sea, in spite of the flatness of its banks, does not flow over the land, is a work of omnipotence which broke over it, i.e., restraining it, a fixed bound (&#1495;&#1511; as <a href="/job/26-10.htm">Job 26:10</a>; <a href="/proverbs/8-29.htm">Proverbs 8:29</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-22.htm">Jeremiah 5:22</a>,  equals  &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;, <a href="/psalms/104-9.htm">Psalm 104:9</a>), viz., the steep and rugged walls of the basin of the sea, and which thereby established a firm barrier behind which it should be kept.
