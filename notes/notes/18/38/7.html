The Vulgate renders it, astra matutina, morning-stars; the Septuagint, &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b5; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;  hote egene&#772;the&#772;nai astra - " when the stars were made:" the Chaldee, "the stars of the zephyr," or "morning" - &#1510;&#1508;&#1512; &#1499;&#1493;&#1499;&#1489;&#1497;. The comparison of a prince, a monarch, or an angel, with a star, is not uncommon; compare the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/14.htm">Isaiah 14</a>. The expression "the morning-stars" is used on account of the beauty of the principal star which, at certain seasons of the year, leads on the morning. It is applied naturally to those angelic beings that are of distinguished glory and rank in heaven. That it refers to the angels, seems to be evident from the connection; and this interpretation is demanded in order to correspond with the phrase "sons of God" in the other member of the verse.<p>Sang together - United in a grand chorus or concert of praise. It was usual to celebrate the laying of a cornerstone, or the completion of an edifice, by rejoicing; see <a href="/zechariah/4-7.htm">Zechariah 4:7</a>; <a href="/ezra/3-10.htm">Ezra 3:10</a>.<p>And all the sons of God - Angels - called the sons of God from their resemblance to him, or their being created by him.<p>Shouted for joy - That is, they joined in praise for so glorious a work as the creation of a new world. They saw that it was an event which was fitted to honor God. It was a new manifestation of his goodness and power; it was an enlargement of his empire; it was an exhibition of benevolence that claimed their gratitude. The expression in this verse is one of uncommon, perhaps of unequalled beauty. The time referred to is at the close of the creation of the earth, for the whole account relates to the formation of this world, and not of the stars. At that period, it is clear that other worlds had been made, and that there were holy beings then in existence who were of such a rank as appropriately to be called "morning-stars" and "sons of God." It is a fair inference therefore, that the "whole" of the universe was not made at once, and that the earth is one of the last of the worlds which have been called into being.<p>No one can demonstrate that the work of creation may not now be going on in some remote part of the universe, nor that God may not yet form many more worlds to be the monuments of his wisdom and goodness, and to give occasion for augmented praise. Who can tell but that this process may be carried on forever, and that new worlds and systems may continue to start into being, and there be continually new displays of this inexhaustible goodness and wisdom of the Creator? When this world was made, there was occasion for songs of praise among the angels. It was a beautiful world. All was pure, and lovely, and holy. Man was made like his God, and everything was full of love. Surveying the beautiful scene, as the world arose under the plastic hand of the Almighty - its hills, and vales, and trees, and flowers, and animals, there was occasion for songs and rejoicings in heaven. Could the angels have foreseen, as perhaps they did, what was to occur here, there was also occasion for songs of praise such as would exist in the creation of no other world. This was to be the world of redeeming love; this the world where the Son of God was to become incarnate and die for sinners; this the world where an immense host was to be redeemed to praise God in a song unknown to the angels - the song of redemption, in the sweet notes which shall ascend from the lips of those who shall have been ransomed from death by the great work of the atonement. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/38.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. So at the founding of Zerubbabel's temple (Ezr 3:10-13). So hereafter at the completion of the Church, the temple of the Holy Ghost (Zec 4:7); as at its foundation (Lu 2:13, 14).<p>morning stars&#8212;especially beautiful. The creation morn is appropriately associated with these, it being the commencement of this world's day. The stars are figuratively said to sing God's praises, as in Ps 19:1; 148:3. They are symbols of the angels, bearing the same relation to our earth, as angels do to us. Therefore they answer to "sons of God," or angels, in the parallel. See on [549]Job 25:5.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/job/38.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The morning stars; </span> either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. The stars properly so called, who are said to sing and praise God, objectively, because they give men ample occasion to do it in regard of their glorious light and stupendous motions, &c. Compare <span class="bld"><a href="/psalms/19-1.htm" title="The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament shows his handiwork.">Psalm 19:1</a> 148:1</span>, &c.

Or rather, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. The sons of God, as it here follows, the latter clause of the verse being explicatory of the former, as is most frequent in this and some other books of Scripture, to wit, the angels, who may well be called <span class="ital">stars</span>, as even men of eminent note, and particularly ministers of God’s word, are called, <span class="bld"><a href="/daniel/8-10.htm" title="And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and it cast down some of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped on them.">Daniel 8:10</a> 12:3 <a href="/revelation/1-16.htm" title="And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a sharp two edged sword: and his countenance was as the sun shines in his strength.">Revelation 1:16</a>,20</span>; and <span class="ital">morning stars</span>, because of their excellent lustre and glory, for which they are called <span class="ital">angels of light</span>, <span class="bld"><a href="/2_corinthians/11-14.htm" title="And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.">2 Corinthians 11:14</a></span>, and Christ for the same reason is called the <span class="ital">Morning Star</span>, <span class="bld"><a href="/revelation/22-16.htm" title="I Jesus have sent my angel to testify to you these things in the churches.

And <span class="ital">all</span> these are said to join in this work of praising God, probably because none of the angels were as yet fallen from their first estate, though they did fall within a very little time after. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Shouted for joy; </span> rejoiced in and blessed God for his works; whereby he intimates that they neither did advise or any way assist him in his works, nor dislike or censure any of his works, as Job had presumed to do with the works of his providence, which are not inferior to those of creation. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/job/38.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>When the morning stars sang together,.... Either all the stars in a literal sense; for though, strictly speaking, there is but one morning star, yet all may be called so, because early created in the morning of the world; and are all stars of light, shine till the morning; and it is observed by some, that the nearer the morning the brighter they shine: and these in their way sing the praises of God, and set forth the glory of his perfections, and occasion songs of praise in men; see <a href="/psalms/148-3.htm">Psalm 148:3</a>. Or figuratively, either angels, as most interpret them, comparable to stars for their glory, purity, and light, for their constancy, permanency, and numbers: or good men, particularly ministers of the word, and angels of the churches; who are stars in Christ's right hand, <a href="/revelation/1-20.htm">Revelation 1:20</a>; but the principal morning star is Christ himself, <a href="/revelation/22-16.htm">Revelation 22:16</a>; <p>and all the sons of God shouted for joy; which are usually understood of angels also, so the Targum; who are the sons of God, not by birth, as Christ, nor by adoption, as saints; but by creation, as Adam, <a href="/luke/3-38.htm">Luke 3:38</a>. And because they bear some likeness to God, as holy spirits, and honour and obey him in doing his will; though the character of sons of God, as distinct from the children of men, given to professors of religion, obtained before the times of Job; see <a href="/genesis/6-2.htm">Genesis 6:2</a>; and who might be said to sing together, and shout for joy, when they met for social worship; see <a href="/job/1-6.htm">Job 1:6</a>; and especially when any fresh discoveries were made to them of the Messiah, and salvation by him. Thus Abraham, one of these sons of God, saw Christ's day and was glad, and shouted for joy, <a href="/john/8-56.htm">John 8:56</a>. For these words are not necessarily to be restrained to the laying of the foundation and cornerstone of the earth, as our version directs; though indeed the angels then might be present, being created as soon as the heavens were, and with the stars, as Capellus on this place observes; and rejoiced, when the foundations of the earth were laid, on beholding such a display of the power, wisdom, and goodness of God therein; and which may be said of them, in allusion to what is done at the laying of the foundation of any building of note; see <a href="/ezra/3-10.htm">Ezra 3:10</a>; for it may be repeated from <a href="/job/38-4.htm">Job 38:4</a>; "where wast thou when the morning stars", &amp;c. and so may refer to any rejoicing, whether of angels or men, before the times of Job, at which he was not present. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/38.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">When the morning stars <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> sang together, and all the <span class="cverse3">{f}</span> sons of God shouted for joy?</span><p>(e) The stars and dumb creatures are said to praise God, because his power, wisdom and goodness is manifest and known in it.<p>(f) Meaning the angels.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/38.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When the morning stars sang together</span>. The stars generally, or the actual stars visible on the morn of creation, are probably meant. They, as it were, sang a song of loud acclaim on witnessing the new marvel. Their priority to the earth is implied, since they witness its birth. Their song is, of course, that silent song of sympathy, whereof Shakespeare speaks when he says, "Each in its motion like an angel sings" ('Merchant of Venice,' act 5. sc. 1). <span class="cmt_word">And all the sons of God shouted for joy</span>. "The sons of God" here must necessarily be the angels (see <a href="/job/1-6.htm">Job 1:6</a>; <a href="/job/2-1.htm">Job 2:1</a>), since there were no men as yet in existence. They too joined in the chorus of sympathy and admiration, perhaps lifting up their voices (<a href="/revelation/5-11.htm">Revelation 5:11, 12</a>), perhaps their hearts only, praising the Creator, who had done such marvellous things. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/38.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>  1  Then Jehovah answered Job out of the storm, and said:<p>  2  Who then darkeneth counsel<p>With words without knowledge?<p>  3  Gird up now thy loins as a man:<p>I will question thee, and inform thou me!<p>"May the Almighty answer me!" Job has said, <a href="/job/31-35.htm">Job 31:35</a>; He now really answers, and indeed out of the storm (Chethib, according to a mode of writing occurring only here and <a href="//biblehub.com/job/40-6.htm">Job 40:6</a>, &#1502;&#1504;&#1492;&#1505;&#1506;&#1512;&#1492;, arranged in two words by the Keri), which is generally the forerunner of His self-manifestation in the world, of that at least by which He reveals Himself in His absolute awe-inspiring greatness and judicial grandeur. The art. is to be understood generically, but, with respect to Elihu's speeches, refers to the storm which has risen up in the meanwhile. It is not to be translated: Who is he who ... , which ought to be &#1492;&#1502;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1498;, but: Who then is darkening; &#1494;&#1492; makes the interrogative &#1502;&#1497; more vivid and demonstrative, Ges. 122, 2; the part. &#1502;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1498; (instead of which it might also be &#1497;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1498;) favours the assumption that Job has uttered such words immediately before, and is interrupted by Jehovah, without an intervening speaker having come forward. It is intentionally &#1506;&#1510;&#1492; for &#1506;&#1510;&#1514;&#1497; (comp. &#1506;&#1501; for &#1506;&#1502;&#1497;, <a href="/isaiah/26-11.htm">Isaiah 26:11</a>), to describe that which is spoken of according to its quality: it is nothing less than a decree or plan full of purpose and connection which Job darkness, i.e., distorts by judging it falsely, or, as we say: places in a false light, and in fact by meaningless words.<p>(Note: The correct accentuation is &#1502;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1498; with Mercha, &#1506;&#1510;&#1492; with Athnach, &#1489;&#1502;&#1500;&#1497;&#1503; with Rebia mugrasch, bly (without Makkeph) with Munach.)<p>When now Jehovah condescends to negotiate with Job by question and answer, He does not do exactly what Job wished (<a href="/job/13-22.htm">Job 13:22</a>), but something different, of which Job never thought. He surprises him with questions which are intended to bring him indirectly to the consciousness of the wrong and absurdity of his challenge - questions among which "there are many which the natural philosophy of the present day can frame more scientifically, but cannot satisfactorily solve." <p>(Note: Alex. v. Humboldt, Kosmos, ii. 48 (1st edition), comp.
