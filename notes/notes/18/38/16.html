If we thus try ourselves, we shall soon be brought to own that what we know is nothing in comparison with what we know not. By the tender mercy of our God, the Day-spring from on high has visited us, to give light to those that sit in darkness, whose hearts are turned to it as clay to the seal, 2Co 4:6. God's way in the government of the world is said to be in the sea; this means, that it is hid from us. Let us make sure that the gates of heaven shall be opened to us on the other side of death, and then we need not fear the opening of the gates of death. It is presumptuous for us, who perceive not the breadth of the earth, to dive into the depth of God's counsels. We should neither in the brightest noon count upon perpetual day, nor in the darkest midnight despair of the return of the morning; and this applies to our inward as well as to our outward condition. What folly it is to strive against God! How much is it our interest to seek peace with him, and to keep in his love!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/38.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? - The word here rendered "springs" (&#1504;&#1489;&#1498;  ne&#770;bek), occurs nowhere else in the Scriptures. It is rendered by the Vulgate "profunda," the deep parts; and by the Septuagint &#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd;  pe&#772;ge&#772;n - "fountains." The reference seems to be to the deep fountains at the bottom of the sea, which were supposed to supply it with water. A large portion of the water of the ocean is indeed conveyed to it by rivers and streams that run on the surface of the earth. But it is known, also, that there are fountains at the bottom of the ocean, and in some places the amount of water that flows from them is so great, that its action is perceptible at the surface. One such fountain exists in the Atlantic ocean near the coast of Florida.<p>Or hast thou walked in the search of the depth? - Or, rather, in the deep places or caverns of the ocean. The word rendered "search" here (&#1495;&#1511;&#1512;  che&#770;qer), means "searching," investigation, and then an object that is to be searched out, and hence, that which is obscure, remote, hidden. Then it may be applied to the deep caverns of the ocean, or the bottom of the sea. This is to man unsearchable. No line has been found long enough to fathom the ocean, and of course what is there is unknown. It is adduced, therefore, with great propriety as a proof of the wisdom of God, that he could look on the deep caverns of the ocean, and was able to search out all that was there. A sentiment similar to this occurs in Homer, when speaking of Atlas:<p>&#x39f;&#788;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5; &#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#894;<p>&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; &#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b1; &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788;&#834;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;.<p>Hoate thalasse&#772;s;<p>Pase&#772;s benthea oiden.<p>Odyssey <a href="/job/1-5.htm">Job 1:5</a>.<p>"Who knows the depths of every sea." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/38.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16. springs&#8212;fountains beneath the sea (Ps 95:4, 5).<p>search&#8212;Rather, "the inmost recesses"; literally, "that which is only found by searching," the deep caverns of ocean.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/job/38.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The springs, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">the tears</span>, i.e. the several springs out of which the waters of the sea flow as tears do from the eyes.

But such as those, called Bathea Ponti, the depths of the Pontus, and are almost three hundred furlongs from the continent, they are said (Plin. ib.) to be of an immense depth, and the bottom not to be found. And if the Sardinian sea, the deepest in the Mediterranean (Aristot. Meteorolog. l. 2, c. 1.) is a thousand orgies or fathoms deep, (Posidonius apud Strabo.
