As it is but little that he knows, he ought not to arraign the Divine counsels; it is but little he can do, therefore he ought not to oppose the ways of Providence. See the all-sufficiency of the Divine Providence; it has wherewithal to satisfy the desire of every living thing. And he that takes care of the young ravens, certainly will not be wanting to his people. This being but one instance of the Divine compassion out of many, gives us occasion to think how much good our God does, every day, beyond what we are aware of. Every view we take of his infinite perfections, should remind us of his right to our love, the evil of sinning against him, and our need of his mercy and salvation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/38.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>To satisfy the desolate and waste ground - As if it lifted an imploring voice to God, and he sent down the rain to satisfy it. The desert is thus like a thirsty pilgrim. It is parched, and thirsty, and sad, and it appeals to God, and he meets its needs, and satisfies it.<p>Or to cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forth - In the desert. There God works alone. No man is there to cultivate the extended wilds, and yet an unseen agency is going forward. The grass springs up; the bud opens; the leaf expands; the flowers breathe forth their fragrance as if they were under the most careful cultivation. All this must be the work of God, since it cannot even be pretended that man is there to produce these effects. Perhaps one would be more deeply impressed with a sense of the presence of God in the pathless desert, or on the boundless prairie, where no man is, than in the most splendid park, or the most tastefully cultivated garden which man could make. In the one case, the hand of God alone is seen; in the other, we are constantly admiring the skill of man. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/38.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>27.

Parched ground seems to cry aloud for water, and so to make a piteous appeal to Heaven.

Hitzig's conjecture, approved by Olsh., &#1504;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497;, sets aside a word that is perfectly clear so far as the language is concerned. On &#1495;&#1511;&#1512; vid., on <a href="/job/11-7.htm">Job 11:7</a>. The question put to Job in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/38-17.htm">Job 38:17</a>, he must, according to his own confession, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/26-6.htm">Job 26:6</a>, answer in the negative. In order to avoid the collision of two aspirates, the interrogative &#1492; is wanting before &#1492;&#1514;&#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1504;&#1514;&#1468;, Ew. 324, b; &#1492;&#1514;&#1489;&#1504;&#1503; &#1506;&#1491; signifies, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/job/32-12.htm">Job 32:12</a>, to observe anything carefully; the meaning of the question therefore is, whether Job has given special attention to the breadth of the earth, and whether he consequently has a comprehensive and thorough knowledge of it. &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468; refers not to the earth (Hahn, Olsh., and others), but, as neuter, to the preceding points of interrogation. The questions, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/38-19.htm">Job 38:19</a>, refer to the principles of light and darkness, i.e., their final causes, whence they come forth as cosmical phenomena. &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1503;&#1470;&#1488;&#1493;&#1512; is a relative clause, Ges. 123, 3, c; the noun that governs (the Regens) this virtual genitive, which ought in Arabic to be without the art. as being determined by the regens, is, according to the Hebrew syntax, which is freer in this respect, &#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; (comp. Ges. 110, 2). That which is said of the bound of darkness, i.e., the furthest point at which darkness passes away, and the paths to its house, applies also to the light, which the poet perhaps has even prominently (comp. <a href="/job/24-13.htm">Job 24:13</a>) before his mind: light and darkness have a first cause which is inaccessible to man, and beyond his power of searching out. The admission in <a href="/job/38-21.htm">Job 38:21</a> is ironical: Verily! thou art as old as the beginning of creation, when light and darkness, as powers of nature which are distinguished and bounded the one by the other (vid., <a href="/job/26-10.htm">Job 26:10</a>), were introduced into the rising world; thou art as old as the world, so that thou hast an exact knowledge of its and thine own contemporaneous origin (vid., <a href="/job/15-7.htm">Job 15:7</a>).
