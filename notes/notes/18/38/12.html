If we thus try ourselves, we shall soon be brought to own that what we know is nothing in comparison with what we know not. By the tender mercy of our God, the Day-spring from on high has visited us, to give light to those that sit in darkness, whose hearts are turned to it as clay to the seal, 2Co 4:6. God's way in the government of the world is said to be in the sea; this means, that it is hid from us. Let us make sure that the gates of heaven shall be opened to us on the other side of death, and then we need not fear the opening of the gates of death. It is presumptuous for us, who perceive not the breadth of the earth, to dive into the depth of God's counsels. We should neither in the brightest noon count upon perpetual day, nor in the darkest midnight despair of the return of the morning; and this applies to our inward as well as to our outward condition. What folly it is to strive against God! How much is it our interest to seek peace with him, and to keep in his love!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/38.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>NOTE: For the meaning of this uncommonly beautiful imagery, see the notes on this place.<p>(f) So all the phenomena of light are represented as evincing the wisdom of God, and as wholly beyond the ability of man to explain or comprehend them; yet so represented as to show that it had been a subject of careful observation and reflection:<p>Where is the way to the dwelling-place of light?<p>And the darkness, where is its place?<p>That thou couldest conduct it to its limits,<p>And that thou shouldest knorr the path to its dwelling?<p><a href="/job/38-12.htm">Job 38:12</a>Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days - That is, in thy lifetime hast thou ordered the light of the morning to shine, and directed its beams over the world? God appeals to this as one of the proofs of his majesty and power - and who can look upon the spreading light of the morning and be insensible to the force and beauty of the appeal? The transition from the ocean to the morning may have been partly because the light of the morning is one of the striking exhibitions of the power of God, and partly because in the creation of the world the light of the sun was made to dawn soon after the gathering together of the waters into seas; see <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/1-10.htm">Genesis 1:10</a>, <a href="/genesis/1-14.htm">Genesis 1:14</a>. The phrase "since thy days," implies that the laws determining the rising of the sun were fixed long before the time of Job. It is asked whether this had been done since he had an existence, and whether he had an agency in effecting it - implying that it was an ancient and established ordinance long before he was born.<p>Caused the day-spring to know his place - The day-spring (&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1512;  shachar) means the "aurora, the dawn, the morning." The mention of its "place" here seems to be an allusion to the fact that it does not always occupy the same position. At one season of the year it appears on the equator, at another north, and at another south of it, and is constantly varying its position. Yet it always knows its place. It never fails to appear where by the long-observed laws it ought to appear. It is regular in its motions, and is evidently under the control of an intelligent Being, who has fixed the laws of its appearing. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/38.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12-15.

Job had lived to see many a morning, but it never was in his power to command one; he had been in such circumstances as to wish for morning light before it was, but was obliged to wait for it, could not hasten it, or cause it to spring before its time; see <a href="/job/7-3.htm">Job 7:3</a>; one of the Targums is, <p>"wast thou in the days of the first creation, and commandedst the morning to be?'' <p>he was not, God was; he was before the first morning, and commanded it into being, <a href="/genesis/1-3.htm">Genesis 1:3</a>; <p>and caused the dayspring to know his place; the first spring of light or dawn of day; which though it has a different place every day in the year, as the sun ascends or descends in the signs of the Zodiac, yet it knows and observes its exact place, being taught of God. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/38.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Hast thou commanded the <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> morning since thy days; <i>and</i> caused the dayspring to know his place;</span><p>(i) That is, to rise, since you were born?</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/job/38.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">12</span>. <span class="ital">since thy days</span>] i. e. since thou wast born, all thy life.

Has Job authority to issue his orders to the dawn, and tell it when to make its appearance? Has he caused the dayspring to know his place? Job cannot possibly pretend to any such power. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/38.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>  4  Where wast thou when I established the earth?<p>Say, if thou art capable of judging!<p>  5  Who hath determined its measure, if thou knowest it,<p>Or who hath stretched the measuring line over it?<p>  6  Upon what are the bases of its pillars sunk in,<p>Or who hath laid its corner-stone,<p>  7  When the morning stars sang together<p>And all the sons of God shouted for joy?<p>The examination begins similarly to <a href="/job/15-7.htm">Job 15:7</a>. In opposition to the censurer of God as such the friends were right, although only negatively, since their conduct was based on self-delusion, as though they were in possession of the key to the mystery of the divine government of the world. &#1497;&#1491;&#1506; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492; signifies to understand how to judge, to possess a competent understanding, <a href="/1_chronicles/12-32.htm">1 Chronicles 12:32</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-12.htm">2 Chronicles 2:12</a>, or (&#1497;&#1491;&#1506; taken not in the sense of novisse, but cognoscere) to appropriate to one's self, <a href="/proverbs/4-1.htm">Proverbs 4:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/29-24.htm">Isaiah 29:24</a>. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/38-5.htm">Job 38:5</a>, interchanges with &#1488;&#1501; (comp. <a href="/job/38-18.htm">Job 38:18</a>), for &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1514;&#1491;&#1506; signifies: suppose that thou knowest it, and this si forte scias is almost equivalent to an forte scis, <a href="/proverbs/30-4.htm">Proverbs 30:4</a>. The founding of the earth is likened altogether to that of a building constructed by man. The question: upon what are the bases of its pillars or foundations sunk (&#1496;&#1489;&#1506;, Arab. t&#803;b&#8219;, according to its radical signification, to press with something flat upon something, comp. Arab. t&#803;bq, to lay two flat things on one another, then both to form or stamp by pressure, and to press into soft pliant stuff, or let down into, immergere, or to sink into, immergi), points to the fact of the earth hanging free in space, <a href="/job/26-7.htm">Job 26:7</a>. Then no human being was present, for man was not yet created; the angels, however, beheld with rejoicing the founding of the place of the future human family, and the mighty acts of God in accordance with the decree of His love (as at the building of the temple, the laying of the foundation, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/3-10.htm">Ezra 3:10</a>, and the setting of the head-stone, <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/4-7.htm">Zechariah 4:7</a>, were celebrated), for the angels were created before the visible world (Psychol. S. 63; Genesis, S. 105), as is indeed not taught here, but still (vid., on the other hand, Hofmann, Schriftbew. i. 400) is assumed. For &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; are, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/1.htm">Job 1-2</a>, the angels, who proceeded from God by a mode of creation which is likened to begetting, and who with Him form one &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769; (Genesis, S. 121). The "morning stars," however, are mentioned in connection with them, because between the stars and the angels, which are both comprehended in &#1510;&#1489;&#1488; &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; (Genesis, S. 128), a mysterious connection exists, which is manifoldly attested in Holy Scripture (vid., on the other hand, Hofm. ib. S. 318). &#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1499;&#1489; &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512; is the morning star which in <a href="/isaiah/14-12.htm">Isaiah 14:12</a> is called &#1492;&#1497;&#1500;&#1500; (as extra-bibl. &#1504;&#1490;&#1492;&#1468;) from its dazzling light, which exceeds all other stars in brightness, and &#1489;&#1468;&#1503;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1512;, son of the dawn, because it swims in the dawn as though it were born from it. It was just the dawn of the world coming into being, which is the subject spoken of, that gave rise to the mention of the morning star; the plur., however, does not mean the stars which came into being on that morning of the world collectively (Hofm., Schlottm.), but Lucifer with the stars his peers, as &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/13-10.htm">Isaiah 13:10</a>, Orion and the stars his peers. Arab. suhayl (Canopus) is used similarly as a generic name for stars of remarkable brilliancy, and in general suhe&#770;l is to the nomads and the Hauranites the symbol of what is brilliant, glorious, and beautiful; <p>(Note: A man or woman of great beauty is called suhe&#770;li, suhel&#305;&#770;je. Thus I heard a Hauranitish woman say to her companion: naha&#770;r el-jo&#770;m neda&#770;, shuft ledsch (Arab. lk) wa&#770;hid Suhe&#770;li, To-day is dew, I saw a Suhe&#770;li, i.e., a very handsome man, for thee. - Wetzst.)<p>so that even the beings of light of the first rank among the celestial spirits might be understood by &#1499;&#1493;&#1499;&#1489;&#1497; &#1489;&#1511;&#1512;. But if this ought to be the meaning, <a href="/job/38-7.htm">Job 38:7</a> and <a href="/job/38-7.htm">Job 38:7</a> would be in an inverted order. They are actual stars, whether it is intended of the sphere belonging to the earth or to the higher sphere comprehended in &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="/genesis/1-1.htm">Genesis 1:1</a>. Joy and light are reciprocal notions, and the scale of the tones of joy is likened to the scale of light and colours; therefore the fulness of light, in which the morning stars shone forth all together at the founding of the earth, may symbolize one grandly harmonious song of joy. </body></html>
