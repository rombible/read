If we thus try ourselves, we shall soon be brought to own that what we know is nothing in comparison with what we know not. By the tender mercy of our God, the Day-spring from on high has visited us, to give light to those that sit in darkness, whose hearts are turned to it as clay to the seal, 2Co 4:6. God's way in the government of the world is said to be in the sea; this means, that it is hid from us. Let us make sure that the gates of heaven shall be opened to us on the other side of death, and then we need not fear the opening of the gates of death. It is presumptuous for us, who perceive not the breadth of the earth, to dive into the depth of God's counsels. We should neither in the brightest noon count upon perpetual day, nor in the darkest midnight despair of the return of the morning; and this applies to our inward as well as to our outward condition. What folly it is to strive against God! How much is it our interest to seek peace with him, and to keep in his love!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/38.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>By what way is the light parted - The reference here is to the light of the morning, that seems to come from one point, and to spread itself at once over the whole earth. It seems to be collected in the east, or, as it were, condensed or concentrated there, and then to divide itself, and to expand over the face of the world. God here asks Job whether he could explain this, or show in what manner it was done. This was one of the subjects which might be supposed early to excite inquiry, and is one which can be as little explained now as then. The causes of the propagation of light, which seems to proceed from a center and to spread rapidly in every direction, are perhaps as little known now as they were in the time of Job. Philosophy has done little to explain this, and the mode in which light is made to travel in eight minutes from the sun to the earth - a distance of ninety million miles - and the manner in which it is "divided" or "parted" from that great center, and spread over the solar system, is as much of a real mystery as it was in the days of Job, and the question proposed here may be asked now with as much emphasis as it was then.<p>Which scattereth the east wind upon the earth - According to this translation, the idea would be that somehow light is the cause of the east wind. But it may be doubted whether this is the true interpretation, and whether it is meant to be affirmed that light has any agency in causing the wind to blow. Herder renders it:<p>"When doth the light divide itself,<p>When the east wind streweth it upon the earth?"<p>According to this, the idea would be that the light of the morning seemed to be borne along by the wind. Umbreit renders it, "Where is the way upon which the east wind flows forth upon the earth?" That is, the east wind, like the light, comes from a certain point, and seems to spread abroad over the world; and the question is, whether Job could explain this? This interpretation is adopted by Rosenmuller and Noyes, and seems to be demanded by the parallelism, and by the nature of the case. The cause of the rapid spreading of the wind from a certain point of the compass, was involved in as much obscurity as the propagation of the light, nor is that cause much better understood now. There is no reason to suppose that the spread of the light, has any particular agency in causing the east wind, as our common version seems to suppose, nor is that idea necessarily in the Hebrew text. The east wind is mentioned here either because the light comes from the east, and the wind from that quarter was more naturally suggested than any other, or because the east wind was remarkable for its violence. The idea that a strong east wind was somehow connected with the dawn of day or the rising of the sun, was one that prevailed, at least to some extent, among the ancients. Thus, Catullus (lxiv. 270ff) says:<p>Hic qualis flatu placidum mare matutino<p>Horrificans zephyrus proclivas incitat undas<p>Aurora exoriente, vagi sub lumina solis. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/38.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24. is &#8230; parted&#8212;parts, so as to diffuse itself over the whole earth, though seeming to come from one point. Light travels from the sun to the earth, ninety millions of miles, in eight minutes.<p>which scattereth&#8212;rather, "And by what way the east wind (personified) spreads (scattereth) itself." The light and east wind are associated together, as both come from one quarter, and often arise together (Jon 4:8).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/job/38.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">By what way; </span> dost thou know all the causes, means, methods, and circumstances of this work of God? <span class="ital">Is the light parted or dispersed or distributed, to wit</span>, in the air, or upon the face of the earth?

Of the light of the sun, which is commonly called <span class="ital">light</span> without any other word added to it, as <span class="bld"><a href="/job/3-4.htm" title="Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine on it.">Job 3:4</a>,9,16 24:14 25:3</span>, &c. And this light of the sun is variously parted or distributed in the world, shining in one place and time, when it doth not shine in another; or for a longer time, or with greater brightness, and power, and virtue, than it doth in another; all which are the effects of God’s infinite wisdom and power, and such as were out of Job’s reach to understand, or at least to effect. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Which scattereth the east wind upon the earth, </span> i.e. which light <span class="ital">scattereth</span>, &c., i.e. raiseth, the east wind, and causeth it to blow hither and thither upon the earth. For as the sun is justly called by the poets and others <span class="ital">the father of the winds</span>, because he draws up those exhalations which give matter to the winds, and for other reasons; so in particular the east wind is oft observed to rise together with the sun, from which also it hath both its Latin and Greek name. But some make this a distinct question from the former, and render the words thus; and (repeat, <span class="ital">by which way</span>) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">the east wind</span> (under which all the other winds may be comprehended) scattereth itself upon the earth, i.e. whence the winds come, and whither they go, which is mentioned as a secret in nature, <span class="bld"><a href="/john/3-8.htm" title="The wind blows where it wants, and you hear the sound thereof, but can not tell from where it comes, and where it goes: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.">John 3:8</a></span>, and how it comes to pass that they blow in such several manners, and with such various and even contrary effects. Or thus, and by which way the <span class="ital">east wind scattereth</span> (to wit, the clouds, or other light things; for this is noted in Scripture to be a most vehement wind, and to scatter the clouds, <span class="bld"><a href="/exodus/14-21.htm" title="And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the LORD caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.">Exodus 14:21</a> <a href="/jonah/4-8.htm" title="And it came to pass, when the sun did arise, that God prepared a vehement east wind; and the sun beat on the head of Jonah, that he fainted, and wished in himself to die, and said, It is better for me to die than to live.">Jonah 4:8</a></span>) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">upon the earth, </span> i.e. whence it comes to pass that the east wind was so violent and furious. But the words may be rendered thus, which (i.e. which light of the sun, or when it, to wit, this light) <span class="ital">scattereth itself</span> (as divers here render this word, that conjugation being often used reciprocally, as is confessed) from (the prefix <span class="ital">mem</span> being understood, as it is very frequently in the Hebrew text) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">the east</span> (for this Hebrew word doth not only signify the <span class="ital">eastern wind</span>, but also the <span class="ital">east</span>, or the eastern part of the heavens or earth, as <span class="bld"><a href="/ezekiel/40-19.htm" title="Then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower gate to the forefront of the inner court without, an hundred cubits eastward and northward.">Ezekiel 40:19</a> 42:16 <a href="/habakkuk/1-9.htm" title="They shall come all for violence: their faces shall sup up as the east wind, and they shall gather the captivity as the sand.">Habakkuk 1:9</a></span>, and in many other places; and <span class="ital">kedem</span>, the root of this word, is constantly so used) <span class="ital">upon</span> or <span class="ital">over the earth, all over the earth</span>. And this is justly mentioned as a wonderful work of God, that as soon as ever the sun ariseth, it parteth or scattereth its light in an instant from one end of the hemisphere to another. But this I propose with submission. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/job/38.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>By what way is the light parted,.... That is, dost thou know by what way it is parted or divided? as at the first creation, when God divided the light from darkness, <a href="/genesis/1-4.htm">Genesis 1:4</a>; or at sun rising and sun setting; and so in the two hemispheres, when there is darkness on the one, and light on the other; or under the two poles, when there are interchangeably six months light and six months darkness. Or how it is parted in an unequal distribution of day and night, at different seasons and in different climates; or how on one and the same day, and at the same time, the sun shall shine in one part of the earth, and not another; and more especially if this had been now a fact, and known, that there should be darkness all over the land of Egypt, and light in Goshen. Some understand this of lightning, but that is later mentioned; <p>which scattereth the east wind upon the earth? that rising sometimes with the sun, or first spring of light; see <a href="/jonah/4-8.htm">Jonah 4:8</a>; or which light spreads and diffuses itself "from the east", as it may be rendered. The sun rises in the east, and in a very quick and surprising manner spreads and diffuses its light throughout the hemisphere. Or this may respect the east wind itself, which scatters the clouds; and either spreads them in the heavens over the earth, or disperses them and drives away rain (x), as the north wind does: or as Mr. Broughton renders the words, "and the east wind scattereth itself over the earth"; it blowing invisibly and without our knowledge, goes and returns as other winds do, <a href="/john/3-8.htm">John 3:8</a>. <p>(x) "Agente nimbos ocyor euro".

That which is said of the bound of darkness, i.e., the furthest point at which darkness passes away, and the paths to its house, applies also to the light, which the poet perhaps has even prominently (comp. <a href="/job/24-13.htm">Job 24:13</a>) before his mind: light and darkness have a first cause which is inaccessible to man, and beyond his power of searching out. The admission in <a href="/job/38-21.htm">Job 38:21</a> is ironical: Verily! thou art as old as the beginning of creation, when light and darkness, as powers of nature which are distinguished and bounded the one by the other (vid., <a href="/job/26-10.htm">Job 26:10</a>), were introduced into the rising world; thou art as old as the world, so that thou hast an exact knowledge of its and thine own contemporaneous origin (vid., <a href="/job/15-7.htm">Job 15:7</a>).
