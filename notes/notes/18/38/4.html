As we cannot find fault with God's work, so we need not fear concerning it.

The question here, "Where wast thou?" implies that Job was not present. He had not then an existence. He could not, therefore, have aided God, or counselled him, or understood what he was doing. How presumptuous, therefore, it was in one so short-lived to sit in judgment on the doings of him who had formed the world! How little could he expect to be able to know of him! The expression, "laid the foundations of the earth," is taken from building an edifice. The foundations are first laid, and the super-structure is then reared. It is a poetic image, and is not designed to give any intimation about the actual process by which the earth was made, or the manner in which it is sustained.<p>If thou hast understanding - Margin, as in Hebrew "if thou knowest." That is, "Declare how it was done. Explain the manner in which the earth was formed and fixed in its place, and by which the beautiful world grew up under the hand of God." If Job could not do this, what presumption was it to speak as he had done of the divine adminisitration! <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/38.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4.

The earth has foundations, and such firm ones that it cannot be moved; but what are they, since it is hung in the air on nothing! No other than the power and will of God, who laid these foundations, and the Son of God, who has created and upholds all things by the word of his power, <a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>. Where was Job then? In a state of nothingness, a mere nonentity: he was not present when this amazing work of nature was done, and saw not how the Lord went about it; and yet takes upon him to dive into the secret works and ways of Providence, for which he is rebuked by this question and the following; <p>declare, if thou hast understanding: Job had the understanding of a man in things natural and civil, and of a good man in things spiritual and divine; but he had no understanding of this, of what he is questioned about; could not declare in what place he was, and where he stood, when the earth was founded. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/38.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Where wast thou when I <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if thou hast understanding.</span><p>(d) Seeing he could not judge those things which were done so long before he was born, he was not able to comprehend all God's works: much less the secret causes of his judgments.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/job/38.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">4</span>.

Didst thou witness it? If not, what canst thou know concerning it? And if thou knowest nothing of creation, what canst thou know of deeper things? The metaphor, by which the creation of the earth is compared to the foundation of an edifice, is a common one (<a href="/psalms/102-25.htm">Psalm 102:25</a>; <a href="/psalms/104-5.htm">Psalm 104:5</a>; <a href="/proverbs/8-29.htm">Proverbs 8:29</a>: <a href="/isaiah/48-13.htm">Isaiah 48:13</a>; <a href="/isaiah/51-13.htm">Isaiah 51:13, 16</a>; <a href="/zechariah/12-1.htm">Zechariah 12:1</a>; <a href="/hebrews/1-10.htm">Hebrews 1:10</a>, etc.), and is to be viewed as a concession to human weakness, creation itself, as it actually took place, being inconceivable. Declare, if thou hast understanding. That is, if thou hast any knowledge on the subject (comp. ver. 18). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/37.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>21  Although one seeth now the sunlight<p>That is bright in the ethereal heights:<p>A wind passeth by and cleareth them up.<p>22  Gold is brought from the north, - <p>Above Eloah is terrible majesty.<p>23  The Almighty, whom we cannot find out,<p>The excellent in strength,<p>And right and justice He perverteth not.<p>24  Therefore men regard Him with reverence,<p>He hath no regard for all the wise of heart.<p>He who censures God's actions, and murmurs against God, injures himself - how, on the contrary, would a patiently submissive waiting on Him be rewarded! This is the connection of thought, by which this final strophe is attached to what precedes. If we have drawn the correct conclusion from <a href="//biblehub.com/job/37-1.htm">Job 37:1</a>, that Elihu's description of a storm is accompanied by a storm which was coming over the sky, &#1493;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;, with which the speech, as <a href="//biblehub.com/job/35-15.htm">Job 35:15</a>, draws towards the close, is not to be understood as purely conclusive, but temporal: And at present one does not see the light (&#1488;&#1493;&#1512; of the sun, as <a href="/job/31-26.htm">Job 31:26</a>) which is bright in the ethereal heights (&#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1497;&#1512; again a Hebr.-Arab. word, comp. ba&#770;hir, outshining, surpassing, especially of the moon, when it dazzles with its brightness); yet it only requires a breath of wind to pass over it, and to clear it, i.e., brings the ethereal sky with the sunlight to view. Elihu hereby means to say that the God who his hidden only for a time, respecting whom one runs the risk of being in perplexity, can suddenly unveil Himself, to our surprise and confusion, and that therefore it becomes us to bow humbly and quietly to His present mysterious visitation. With respect to the removal of the clouds from the beclouded sun, to which <a href="/job/37-21.htm">Job 37:21</a> refers, &#1494;&#1492;&#1489;, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/37-22.htm">Job 37:22</a>, seems to signify the gold of the sun; esh-shemsu bi-tibrin, the sun is gold, says Abulola. Oriental and Classic literature furnishes a large number of instances in support of this calling the sunshine gold; and it should not perplex us here, where we have an Arabizing Hebrew poet before us, that not a single passage can be brought forward from the Old Testament literature. But &#1502;&#1510;&#1468;&#1508;&#1493;&#1503; is against this figurative rendering of the &#1494;&#1492;&#1489; (lxx &#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3b7; &#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;). In <a href="/ezekiel/1-4.htm">Ezekiel 1:4</a> there is good reason for the storm-clouds, which unfold from their midst the glory of the heavenly Judge, who rideth upon the cherubim, coming from the north; but wherefore should Elihu represent the sun's golden light as breaking through from the north? On the other hand, in the conception of the ancients, the north is the proper region for gold: there griffins (grupe's) guard the gold-pits of the Arimaspian mountains (Herod. iii. 116); there, from the narrow pass of the Caucasus along the Gordyaean mountains, gold is dug by barbarous races (Pliny, h. n. vi. 11), and among the Scythians it is brought to light by the ants (ib. xxxiii. 4). Egypt could indeed provide itself with gold from Ethiopia, and the Phoenicians brought the gold of Ophir, already mentioned in the book of Job, from India; but the north was regarded as the fabulously most productive chief mine of gold; to speak more definitely: Northern Asia, with the Altai mountains.<p>(Note: Vid., the art. Gold, S. 91, 101, in Ersch and Gruber. The Indian traditions concerning Uttaraguru (the "High Mountain"), and concerning the northern seat of the god on wealth Kuvra, have no connection here; on their origin comp. Lassen, Indische Alterthumskunde, i.848.)<p>Thus therefore <a href="//biblehub.com/job/28-1.htm">Job 28:1</a>, <a href="/job/28-6.htm">Job 28:6</a> is to be compared here.<p>continued...</body></html>
