Unless all was to remain hopelessly uncertain and dark, there could be no solution of the questions so fiercely and obstinately debated but by the intervention of Him whose government was the matter in dispute. And so the Lord answered Job out of <span class= "ital">the </span>whirlwind, or tempest: that is to say, the tempest which had been long gathering, and which had been the subject of Elihu’s remarks. The one argument which is developed in the remaining chapters is drawn from man’s ignorance. There is so much in nature that man knows not and cannot understand, that it is absurd for him to suppose that he can judge aright in matters touching God’s moral government of the world. Though Job is afterwards (<a href="/job/42-8.htm" title="Therefore take to you now seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you: for him will I accept: lest I deal with you after your folly, in that you have not spoken of me the thing which is right, like my servant Job.">Job 42:8</a>) justified by God, yet the tone of all that God says to him is more or less mingled with reproach.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/job/38.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/job/38-1.htm" title="Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,">Job 38:1</a></span>. <span class="ital">Then the Lord answered Job — </span>No sooner had Elihu uttered the words last mentioned, but there was a sensible token of the presence of that dreadful majesty of God among them, spoken of <a href="/job/38-22.htm" title="Have you entered into the treasures of the snow? or have you seen the treasures of the hail,">Job 38:22</a>, and Jehovah began to debate the matter with Job, as he had desired; <span class="ital">out of the whirlwind </span>— Out of a dark and thick cloud, from which he sent a terrible and tempestuous wind, as the harbinger of his presence. The LXX. render the clause, <span class="greekheb">δια λαιλαπος και νεφων</span>, <span class="ital">perturbinem et nubes, by a tempest and clouds. </span>It is true, the Chaldee paraphrast, by the addition of a word, has given a very different exposition of this text, thus: <span class="ital">Then the Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind of grief; </span>taking the word <span class="greekheb">סערה</span>, <span class="ital">segnarah, </span>rendered <span class="ital">whirlwind, </span>not in a literal, but in a metaphorical sense: as if the meaning were only this: that amidst the tumult of Job’s sorrows, God suggested to him the following thoughts, to bring him to a sense of his condition. The matter is viewed in nearly the same light by a late writer in a periodical work, styled <span class="ital">The Classical Journal, </span>who contends that this Hebrew word properly means <span class="ital">trouble, </span>and may be rendered <span class="ital">whirlwind </span>only when it is applied to the elements, denoting the troubled state of the atmosphere; but when it has reference to man, it can have no such signification. In answer to this it must be observed, that many passages occur in the Old Testament, in which the word evidently means, and is rightly translated, <span class="ital">whirlwind, </span>or <span class="ital">tempest, </span>as that writer himself acknowledges; but probably not one can be found, at least he has not produced one, in which, as a noun, it means merely <span class="ital">trouble, </span>nor can it with propriety be so translated here, on account of the preposition <span class="greekheb">מן</span>, <span class="ital">min, </span>which properly means <span class="ital">a, ab, de, e, ex, from, </span>or <span class="ital">out of, </span>and not <span class="ital">because of, </span>as he proposes rendering it: for surely it would be improper to read the passage, “The Lord answered Job out of his trouble, &c.” Accordingly the generality of expositors agree to understand it of a sensible and miraculous interposition of the Deity appearing in a cloud, the symbol of his presence, not to dispute, but absolutely to decide the controversy. God appeared and spoke to him in this manner, says Poole, 1st. Because this was his usual method of manifesting himself in those times, and declaring his will, as we see <a href="/exodus/19-13.htm" title="There shall not an hand touch it, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through; whether it be beast or man, it shall not live: when the trumpet sounds long, they shall come up to the mount.">Exodus 19:13</a>; <a href="/numbers/9-15.htm" title="And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle, namely, the tent of the testimony: and at even there was on the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, until the morning.">Numbers 9:15</a>; <a href="/1_kings/19-11.htm" title="And he said, Go forth, and stand on the mount before the LORD.

Thunders, lightnings, and a whirlwind announce his approach: all creation trembles at his presence: at the blaze of his all-piercing eye every disguise falls off; the stateliness of human pride, the vanity of human knowledge, sink into their original nothing. The man of understanding, the men of age and experience; he who desired nothing more than to argue the point with God; he that would maintain his ways to his face; confounded and struck dumb at his presence, is ready to drop into dissolution, and repents in dust and ashes.” See Heath.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/job/38.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>38:1-3 Job had silenced, but had not convinced his friends. Elihu had silenced Job, but had not brought him to admit his guilt before God. It pleased the Lord to interpose. The Lord, in this discourse, humbles Job, and brings him to repent of his passionate expressions concerning God's providential dealings with him; and this he does, by calling upon Job to compare God's being from everlasting to everlasting, with his own time; God's knowledge of all things, with his own ignorance; and God's almighty power, with his own weakness. Our darkening the counsels of God's wisdom with our folly, is a great provocation to God. Humble faith and sincere obedience see farthest and best into the will of the Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/38.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Then the Lord answered Job - This speech is addressed particularly to Job, not only because he is the principal personage referred to in the book, but particularly because he had indulged in language of murmuring and complaint. God designed to bring him to a proper state of mind before he appeared openly for his vindication. It is the purpose of God, in his dealings with his people, "to bring them to a proper state of mind" before he appears as their vindicator and friend, and hence, their trials are often prolonged, and when he appears, he seems at first to come only to rebuke them. Job had indulged in very improper feelings, and it was needful that those feelings should be subdued before God would manifest himself as his friend, and address him in words of consolation.<p>Out of the whirlwind - The tempest; the storm - probably that which Elihu had seen approaching, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/37-21.htm">Job 37:21-24</a>. God is often represented as speaking to people in this manner. He spake amidst lightnings and tempests on Mount Sinai <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16-19</a>, and he is frequently represented as appearing amidst the thunders and lightnings of a tempest, as a symbol of his majesty; compare <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/18-9.htm">Psalm 18:9-13</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-3.htm">Habakkuk 3:3-6</a>. The word here rendered "whirlwind" means rather "a storm, a tempest." The Septuagint renders this verse, "After Elihu had ceased speaking, the Lord spake to Job from a tempest and clouds." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/38.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 38<p>Job 38:1-41.<p>1. Jehovah appears unexpectedly in a whirlwind (already gathering Job 37:1, 2), the symbol of "judgment" (Ps 50:3, 4, &c.), to which Job had challenged Him. He asks him now to get himself ready for the contest. Can he explain the phenomena of God's natural government? How can he, then, hope to understand the principles of His moral government? God thus confirms Elihu's sentiment, that submission to, not reasonings on, God's ways is man's part. This and the disciplinary design of trial to the godly is the great lesson of this book. He does not solve the difficulty by reference to future retribution: for this was not the immediate question; glimpses of that truth were already given in the fourteenth and nineteenth chapters, the full revelation of it being reserved for Gospel times. Yet even now we need to learn the lesson taught by Elihu and God in Job.The Lord answers Job, <span class="bld"><a href="/context/job/38-1.htm" title="Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,...">Job 38:1-3</a></span>: declareth his works of creation; the foundation and the measures of the earth, <span class="bld"><a href="/context/job/38-4.htm" title="Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if you have understanding....">Job 38:4-6</a></span>; the stars; the sea, and its bounds, <span class="bld"><a href="/context/job/38-7.htm" title="When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?...">Job 38:7-11</a></span>; the morning, and its light, <span class="bld"><a href="/context/job/38-12.htm" title="Have you commanded the morning since your days; and caused the dayspring to know his place;...">Job 38:12-15</a></span>; the depth of the sea; the gates and shadow of death; the breadth of the earth, <span class="bld"><a href="/context/job/38-16.htm" title="Have you entered into the springs of the sea? or have you walked in the search of the depth?...">Job 38:16-18</a></span>; the place of light and darkness; the treasures of snow and hail for battle, <span class="bld"><a href="/context/job/38-19.htm" title="Where is the way where light dwells? and as for darkness, where is the place thereof,...">Job 38:19-23</a></span>; the east wind, springs, and rain for the earth, <span class="bld"><a href="/context/job/38-24.htm" title="By what way is the light parted, which scatters the east wind on the earth?...">Job 38:24-30</a></span>; the planets, ordinances of heaven, and their dominion on the earth; clouds and lightning, <span class="bld"><a href="/context/job/38-31.htm" title="Can you bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion?...">Job 38:31-35</a></span>.

As soon as Elihu had done speaking, who saw the tempest rising, and gave hints of it, <a href="/job/37-2.htm">Job 37:2</a>; and hastened to finish his discourse. This was raised to give notice of the Lord being about to appear, and to display his majesty, and to command reverence and attention. The Targum calls it the whirlwind of distress, as it might be to Job; and a representation of the distressed and disturbed state and condition in which he was. The person that spoke out of it is Jehovah the Son of God, the eternal Word, who very probably appeared in an human form; there was an object seen, <a href="/job/42-5.htm">Job 42:5</a>; and spoke with an articulate voice to Job; <p>and said; in answer to his frequent wishes and desires that the Lord would appear and take his cause in hand. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/38.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then the LORD answered Job out of the <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> whirlwind, and said,</span><p>(a) That his words might have greater majesty, and that Job might know with whom he had to do.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/job/38.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">1</span>. <span class="ital">out of the whirlwind</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">out of the storm</span>.

It is remarked, with reason, that the special mention of Job as the person answered "implies that another speaker had intervened" (Wordsworth); while the attachment of the article to the word "whirlwind" implies some previous mention of that phenomenon, which is only to be found in the discourse of Elihu (<a href="/job/37-9.htm">Job 37:9</a>). Both points have an important bearing on the genuineness of the disputed section, ch. 32- 37. <span class="cmt_word">And said</span>. The question whether there was an objective utterance of human words out of the whirlwind, or only a subjective impression of the thoughts recorded on the minds of those present, is unimportant.
