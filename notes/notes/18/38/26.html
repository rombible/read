As it is but little that he knows, he ought not to arraign the Divine counsels; it is but little he can do, therefore he ought not to oppose the ways of Providence. See the all-sufficiency of the Divine Providence; it has wherewithal to satisfy the desire of every living thing. And he that takes care of the young ravens, certainly will not be wanting to his people. This being but one instance of the Divine compassion out of many, gives us occasion to think how much good our God does, every day, beyond what we are aware of. Every view we take of his infinite perfections, should remind us of his right to our love, the evil of sinning against him, and our need of his mercy and salvation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/38.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>To cause it to rain on the earth, where no man is - This is designed to heighten the conception of the power of God. It could not be pretended that this was done by man, for the rain was caused to fall in the desolate regions where no one dwelt. In the lonely desert, in the wastes remote from the dwellings of people, the rain is sent down, evidently by the providential care of God, and far beyond the reach of the agency of man. There is very great beauty in this whole description of God as superintending the falling rain far away from the homes of people, and in those lonely wastes pouring down the waters, that the tender herb may spring up, and the flowers bloom under his hand. All this may seem to be wasted, but it is not so in the eye of God. Not a drop of rain falls in the sandy desert or on the barren rock, however useless it may seem to be, that is not seen to be of value by God, and that is not designated to accomplish some important purpose there. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/38.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>26. Since rain fails also on places uninhabited by man, it cannot be that man guides its course. Such rain, though man cannot explain the reason for it, is not lost.

Man is not, as he might think, the only object of God’s regard. God is great and His providence very wide. His goodness is over all His works.

God not only causes his rain to fall equally on the just and on the unjust (<a href="/matthew/5-45.htm">Matthew 5:45</a>), but equally, or almost equally, on inhabited lauds and uninhabited. His providence does not limit itself to supplying the wants of man, but has tender regard to the beasts, and birds, and reptiles, and insects which possess the lands whereon man has not yet set his foot. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/38.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>16  Hast thou reached the fountains of the sea,<p>And hast thou gone into the foundation of the deep?<p>17  Were the gates of death unveiled to thee,<p>And didst thou see the gates of the realm of shades?<p>18  Hast thou comprehended the breadth of the earth?<p>Speak, in so far as thou knowest all this!<p>19  Which is the way to where the light dwelleth,<p>And darkness, where is its place,<p>20  That thou mightest bring it to its bound,<p>And that thou mightest know the paths of its house?<p>21  Thou knowest it, for then wast thou born,<p>And the number of thy days is great! - <p>The root &#1504;&#1489; has the primary notion of obtruding itself upon the senses (vid., Genesis, S. 635), whence &#1504;&#1489;&#1498; in Arabic of a rising country that pleases the eye (nabaka, a hill, a hillside), and here (cognate in root and meaning &#1504;&#1489;&#1506;, Syr. Talmud. &#1504;&#1489;&#1490;, Arab. nbg, nbt&#803;, scatuirire) of gushing and bubbling water. Hitzig's conjecture, approved by Olsh., &#1504;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497;, sets aside a word that is perfectly clear so far as the language is concerned. On &#1495;&#1511;&#1512; vid., on <a href="/job/11-7.htm">Job 11:7</a>. The question put to Job in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/38-17.htm">Job 38:17</a>, he must, according to his own confession, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/26-6.htm">Job 26:6</a>, answer in the negative. In order to avoid the collision of two aspirates, the interrogative &#1492; is wanting before &#1492;&#1514;&#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1504;&#1514;&#1468;, Ew. 324, b; &#1492;&#1514;&#1489;&#1504;&#1503; &#1506;&#1491; signifies, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/job/32-12.htm">Job 32:12</a>, to observe anything carefully; the meaning of the question therefore is, whether Job has given special attention to the breadth of the earth, and whether he consequently has a comprehensive and thorough knowledge of it. &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468; refers not to the earth (Hahn, Olsh., and others), but, as neuter, to the preceding points of interrogation. The questions, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/38-19.htm">Job 38:19</a>, refer to the principles of light and darkness, i.e., their final causes, whence they come forth as cosmical phenomena. &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1503;&#1470;&#1488;&#1493;&#1512; is a relative clause, Ges. 123, 3, c; the noun that governs (the Regens) this virtual genitive, which ought in Arabic to be without the art. as being determined by the regens, is, according to the Hebrew syntax, which is freer in this respect, &#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; (comp. Ges. 110, 2). That which is said of the bound of darkness, i.e., the furthest point at which darkness passes away, and the paths to its house, applies also to the light, which the poet perhaps has even prominently (comp. <a href="/job/24-13.htm">Job 24:13</a>) before his mind: light and darkness have a first cause which is inaccessible to man, and beyond his power of searching out. The admission in <a href="/job/38-21.htm">Job 38:21</a> is ironical: Verily! thou art as old as the beginning of creation, when light and darkness, as powers of nature which are distinguished and bounded the one by the other (vid., <a href="/job/26-10.htm">Job 26:10</a>), were introduced into the rising world; thou art as old as the world, so that thou hast an exact knowledge of its and thine own contemporaneous origin (vid., <a href="/job/15-7.htm">Job 15:7</a>).
