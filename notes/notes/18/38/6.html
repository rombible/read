The beauty and propriety of these allusions of the prophets will appear with greater lustre, when it is considered that the hosts of heaven were the objects of heathen idolatry: both the visible and invisible host; as well the angels as the lights of heaven; for the superstition seems to have been originally the same, as the worship of the heavenly bodies terminated in the worship of those angels or intelligences who were believed to animate or conduct them; and hence we see a reason why the angels are called <span class="ital">stars </span>and <span class="ital">morning stars </span>in Scripture.” — Peters. <span class="ital">And the sons of God — </span>The angels, as before, called <span class="ital">the sons of God, </span>because they had their whole being from him, and because they bear his divine and glorious image; <span class="ital">shouted for joy — </span>On the appearance of the new-made world, in the creation of which they saw new displays of their heavenly Father’s wisdom, power, and goodness, and learned to know more of his infinite perfections than they had known before, and, of consequence, to love and praise him with greater fervency and delight.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/job/38.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>38:4-11 For the humbling of Job, God here shows him his ignorance, even concerning the earth and the sea.

The Hebrew word (&#1488;&#1491;&#1503;  'eden) means "a basis," as of a column, or a pedestal; and then also the foundation of a building. The language here is evidently figurative, comparing the earth with an edifice. In building a house, the securing of a proper foundation is essential to its stability; and here God represents himself as rearing the earth on the most permanent and solid basis. The word is not used in the sense of sockets, as it is in the margin.<p>Fastened - Margin, "made to sink." The margin rather expresses the sense of the Hebrew word &#1492;&#1496;&#1489;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;  ha&#772;t&#803;a&#770;ba&#8219;u&#770;.

The word does not elsewhere occur in the Scriptures, and the prevailing sense is that of "sinking," or "settling down," and hence, to "impress" - as a seal "settles down" into wax. The reference here is to a foundation-stone that sinks or settles down into clay or mire until it becomes solid.<p>Or who laid the corner stone thereof - Still an allusion to a building. The cornerstone sustains the principal weight of an edifice, as the weight of two walls is concentrated on it, and hence, it is of such importance that it should be solid and firmly fixed. The question proposed for the solution of Job is, On what the earth is founded? On this question a great variety of opinions waft entertained by the ancients, and of course no correct solution could be given of the difficulty. It was not known that it was suspended and held in its place by the laws of gravitation. The meaning here is, that if Job could not solve this inquiry, he ought not to presume to sit in judgment on the government of God, and to suppose that he was qualified to judge of his secret counsels. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/38.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. foundations&#8212;not "sockets," as Margin.<p>fastened&#8212;literally, "made to sink," as a foundation-stone let down till it settles firmly in the clay (Job 26:7).

This is the connection of thought, by which this final strophe is attached to what precedes. If we have drawn the correct conclusion from <a href="//biblehub.com/job/37-1.htm">Job 37:1</a>, that Elihu's description of a storm is accompanied by a storm which was coming over the sky, &#1493;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;, with which the speech, as <a href="//biblehub.com/job/35-15.htm">Job 35:15</a>, draws towards the close, is not to be understood as purely conclusive, but temporal: And at present one does not see the light (&#1488;&#1493;&#1512; of the sun, as <a href="/job/31-26.htm">Job 31:26</a>) which is bright in the ethereal heights (&#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1497;&#1512; again a Hebr.-Arab. word, comp. ba&#770;hir, outshining, surpassing, especially of the moon, when it dazzles with its brightness); yet it only requires a breath of wind to pass over it, and to clear it, i.e., brings the ethereal sky with the sunlight to view. Elihu hereby means to say that the God who his hidden only for a time, respecting whom one runs the risk of being in perplexity, can suddenly unveil Himself, to our surprise and confusion, and that therefore it becomes us to bow humbly and quietly to His present mysterious visitation. With respect to the removal of the clouds from the beclouded sun, to which <a href="/job/37-21.htm">Job 37:21</a> refers, &#1494;&#1492;&#1489;, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/37-22.htm">Job 37:22</a>, seems to signify the gold of the sun; esh-shemsu bi-tibrin, the sun is gold, says Abulola. Oriental and Classic literature furnishes a large number of instances in support of this calling the sunshine gold; and it should not perplex us here, where we have an Arabizing Hebrew poet before us, that not a single passage can be brought forward from the Old Testament literature. But &#1502;&#1510;&#1468;&#1508;&#1493;&#1503; is against this figurative rendering of the &#1494;&#1492;&#1489; (lxx &#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3b7; &#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;). In <a href="/ezekiel/1-4.htm">Ezekiel 1:4</a> there is good reason for the storm-clouds, which unfold from their midst the glory of the heavenly Judge, who rideth upon the cherubim, coming from the north; but wherefore should Elihu represent the sun's golden light as breaking through from the north? On the other hand, in the conception of the ancients, the north is the proper region for gold: there griffins (grupe's) guard the gold-pits of the Arimaspian mountains (Herod. iii. 116); there, from the narrow pass of the Caucasus along the Gordyaean mountains, gold is dug by barbarous races (Pliny, h. n. vi. 11), and among the Scythians it is brought to light by the ants (ib. xxxiii. 4). Egypt could indeed provide itself with gold from Ethiopia, and the Phoenicians brought the gold of Ophir, already mentioned in the book of Job, from India; but the north was regarded as the fabulously most productive chief mine of gold; to speak more definitely: Northern Asia, with the Altai mountains.<p>(Note: Vid., the art. Gold, S. 91, 101, in Ersch and Gruber. The Indian traditions concerning Uttaraguru (the "High Mountain"), and concerning the northern seat of the god on wealth Kuvra, have no connection here; on their origin comp.
