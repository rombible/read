The church stands as firm as the earth.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/38.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Or who shut up the sea with doors - This refers also to the act of the creation, and to the fact that God fixed limits to the raging of the ocean. The word "doors" is used here rather to denote gates, such as are made to shut up water in a dam. The Hebrew word properly refers, in the dual form which is used here &#1491;&#1500;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501;  delethiym), to "double doors," or to folding doors, and is also applied to the gates of a city; <a href="/deuteronomy/3-5.htm">Deuteronomy 3:5</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/23-7.htm">1 Samuel 23:7</a>; <a href="/isaiah/45-1.htm">Isaiah 45:1</a>. The idea is, that the floods were bursting forth from the abyss or the center of the earth, and were checked by placing gates or doors which restrained them. Whether this is designed to be a poetic or a real description of what took place at the creation, it is not easy to determine. Nothing forbids the idea that something like this may have occurred when the waters in the earth were pouring forth tumultuously, and when they were restrained by obstructions placed there by the hand of God, as if he had made gates through which they could pass only when he should open them. This supposition also would accord well with the account of the flood in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/7-11.htm">Genesis 7:11</a>, where it is said that "the fountains of the great deep were broken up," as if those flood-gates had been opened, or the obstructions which God had placed there had been suffered to be broken through, and the waters of their own accord flowed over the world. We know as yet too little of the interior of the earth, to ascertain whether this is to be understood as a literal description of what actually occurred.<p>When it brake forth, as if it had issued out of the womb - All the images here are taken from child-birth. The ocean is represented as being born, and then as invested with clouds and darkness as its covering and its swaddling-bands. The image is a bold one, and I do not know that it is any where else applied to the formation of the ocean. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/38.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. doors&#8212;floodgates; these when opened caused the flood (Ge 8:2); or else, the shores.<p>womb&#8212;of chaos.

From the earth the transition is to the sea, according to the order of the creation; and this refers not to the state and case of the sea as at the flood, of which some interpret it, but as at its first creation; and it is throughout this account represented as an infant, and here first as in embryo, shut up in the bowels of the earth, where it was when first created with it, as an infant shut up in its mother's womb, and with the doors of it; see <a href="/job/3-10.htm">Job 3:10</a>; the bowels of the earth being the storehouses where God first laid up the deep waters, <a href="/psalms/33-7.htm">Psalm 33:7</a>; and when the chaos, the misshapen earth, was like a woman big with child; <p>when it brake forth out of the abyss, as the Targum, with force and violence, as Pharez broke out of his mother's womb; for which reason he had his name given, which signifies a breach, <a href="/genesis/38-29.htm">Genesis 38:29</a>; so it follows, <p>as if it had issued out of the womb; as a child out of its mother's womb; so the sea burst forth and issued out of the bowels of the earth, and covered it all around, as in <a href="/psalms/104-6.htm">Psalm 104:6</a>; and now it was that the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters, before they were drained off the earth; this was the first open visible production of the sea, and nay be called the birth of it; see <a href="/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a>.

God's might is especially shown in his power to control and confine the sea, which rages so terribly and seems so utterly uncontrollable. God has blocked it in "with doors" - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> with "bounds that it cannot pass, neither turn again to cover the earth" (<a href="/psalms/145-9.htm">Psalm 145:9</a>). Sometimes the barrier is one of lofty and solid rock, which seems well suited to confine and restrain; but sometimes it is no more than a thin streak of sliver sand or a bank of loose, shifting pebbles. Yet, in both cases alike, the restraint suffices. "The sand is placed for the bound of the sea by a perpetual decree, that it cannot pass it" (<a href="/jeremiah/5-22.htm">Jeremiah 5:22</a>); the beach of shifting pebbles remains as firm as the rock itself, and never recedes or advances more than a few feet. <span class="cmt_word">When it brake forth, as if it had issued out of the womb</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> at its birth, when it was first formed, by the gathering together of the waters into one place (see <a href="/genesis/1-9.htm">Genesis 1:9</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/38.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>  1  Then Jehovah answered Job out of the storm, and said:<p>  2  Who then darkeneth counsel<p>With words without knowledge?<p>  3  Gird up now thy loins as a man:<p>I will question thee, and inform thou me!<p>"May the Almighty answer me!" Job has said, <a href="/job/31-35.htm">Job 31:35</a>; He now really answers, and indeed out of the storm (Chethib, according to a mode of writing occurring only here and <a href="//biblehub.com/job/40-6.htm">Job 40:6</a>, &#1502;&#1504;&#1492;&#1505;&#1506;&#1512;&#1492;, arranged in two words by the Keri), which is generally the forerunner of His self-manifestation in the world, of that at least by which He reveals Himself in His absolute awe-inspiring greatness and judicial grandeur. The art. is to be understood generically, but, with respect to Elihu's speeches, refers to the storm which has risen up in the meanwhile. It is not to be translated: Who is he who ... , which ought to be &#1492;&#1502;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1498;, but: Who then is darkening; &#1494;&#1492; makes the interrogative &#1502;&#1497; more vivid and demonstrative, Ges. 122, 2; the part. &#1502;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1498; (instead of which it might also be &#1497;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1498;) favours the assumption that Job has uttered such words immediately before, and is interrupted by Jehovah, without an intervening speaker having come forward. It is intentionally &#1506;&#1510;&#1492; for &#1506;&#1510;&#1514;&#1497; (comp. &#1506;&#1501; for &#1506;&#1502;&#1497;, <a href="/isaiah/26-11.htm">Isaiah 26:11</a>), to describe that which is spoken of according to its quality: it is nothing less than a decree or plan full of purpose and connection which Job darkness, i.e., distorts by judging it falsely, or, as we say: places in a false light, and in fact by meaningless words.<p>(Note: The correct accentuation is &#1502;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1498; with Mercha, &#1506;&#1510;&#1492; with Athnach, &#1489;&#1502;&#1500;&#1497;&#1503; with Rebia mugrasch, bly (without Makkeph) with Munach.)<p>When now Jehovah condescends to negotiate with Job by question and answer, He does not do exactly what Job wished (<a href="/job/13-22.htm">Job 13:22</a>), but something different, of which Job never thought. He surprises him with questions which are intended to bring him indirectly to the consciousness of the wrong and absurdity of his challenge - questions among which "there are many which the natural philosophy of the present day can frame more scientifically, but cannot satisfactorily solve." <p>(Note: Alex. v.
