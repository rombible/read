If we thus try ourselves, we shall soon be brought to own that what we know is nothing in comparison with what we know not. By the tender mercy of our God, the Day-spring from on high has visited us, to give light to those that sit in darkness, whose hearts are turned to it as clay to the seal, 2Co 4:6. God's way in the government of the world is said to be in the sea; this means, that it is hid from us. Let us make sure that the gates of heaven shall be opened to us on the other side of death, and then we need not fear the opening of the gates of death. It is presumptuous for us, who perceive not the breadth of the earth, to dive into the depth of God's counsels. We should neither in the brightest noon count upon perpetual day, nor in the darkest midnight despair of the return of the morning; and this applies to our inward as well as to our outward condition. What folly it is to strive against God! How much is it our interest to seek peace with him, and to keep in his love!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/38.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That it might take hold of the ends of the earth - Margin, as in Hebrew "wings." Wings are in the Scriptures frequently given to the earth, because it seems to be spread out, and the expression refers to its extremities. The language is derived from the supposition that the earth was a plain, and had limits or bounds. The idea here is, that God causes the light of the morning suddenly to spread to the remotest parts of the world, and to reveal everything which was there.<p>That the wicked might be shaken out of it - Out of the earth; that is, by the light which suddenly shines upon them. The sense is, that the wicked perform their deeds in the darkness of the night, and that in the morning light they flee away. The effect of the light coming upon them is to disturb their plans, to fill them with alarm, and to cause them to flee. The idea is highly poetic. The wicked are engaged in various acts of iniquity under cover of the night. Robbers, thieves, and adulterers, go forth to their deeds of darkness as though no one saw them. The light of the morning steals suddenly upon them, and they flee before it under the apprehension of being detected. "The dawn," says Herder, "is represented as a watchman, a messenger of the Prince of heaven, sent to chase away the bands of robbers." It may illustrate this to observe that it is still the custom of the Arabs to go on plundering excursions before the dawn. When on their way this faithful watchman, the aurora, goes out to spread light about them, to intimidate them, and to disperse them; compare the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/job/24-13.htm">Job 24:13-17</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/38.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. take hold of the ends, &c.&#8212;spread itself over the earth to its utmost bounds in a moment.<p>wicked&#8212;who hate the light, and do their evil works in the dark (Job 24:13).<p>shaken out of it&#8212;The corners (Hebrew, "wings" or "skirts") of it, as of a garment, are taken hold of by the dayspring, so as to shake off the wicked.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/job/38.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> That this morning light should in a moment spread itself over the face of the whole earth, from one end of the hemisphere to the other. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Shaken out of it, </span> from the face of the earth.

The wicked, lovers of darkness, are taken by surprise, and receive a shock from which they recover with difficulty (comp. <a href="/job/24-16.htm">Job 24:16, 17</a>).

In opposition to the censurer of God as such the friends were right, although only negatively, since their conduct was based on self-delusion, as though they were in possession of the key to the mystery of the divine government of the world. &#1497;&#1491;&#1506; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492; signifies to understand how to judge, to possess a competent understanding, <a href="/1_chronicles/12-32.htm">1 Chronicles 12:32</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-12.htm">2 Chronicles 2:12</a>, or (&#1497;&#1491;&#1506; taken not in the sense of novisse, but cognoscere) to appropriate to one's self, <a href="/proverbs/4-1.htm">Proverbs 4:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/29-24.htm">Isaiah 29:24</a>. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/38-5.htm">Job 38:5</a>, interchanges with &#1488;&#1501; (comp. <a href="/job/38-18.htm">Job 38:18</a>), for &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1514;&#1491;&#1506; signifies: suppose that thou knowest it, and this si forte scias is almost equivalent to an forte scis, <a href="/proverbs/30-4.htm">Proverbs 30:4</a>. The founding of the earth is likened altogether to that of a building constructed by man. The question: upon what are the bases of its pillars or foundations sunk (&#1496;&#1489;&#1506;, Arab. t&#803;b&#8219;, according to its radical signification, to press with something flat upon something, comp. Arab. t&#803;bq, to lay two flat things on one another, then both to form or stamp by pressure, and to press into soft pliant stuff, or let down into, immergere, or to sink into, immergi), points to the fact of the earth hanging free in space, <a href="/job/26-7.htm">Job 26:7</a>. Then no human being was present, for man was not yet created; the angels, however, beheld with rejoicing the founding of the place of the future human family, and the mighty acts of God in accordance with the decree of His love (as at the building of the temple, the laying of the foundation, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/3-10.htm">Ezra 3:10</a>, and the setting of the head-stone, <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/4-7.htm">Zechariah 4:7</a>, were celebrated), for the angels were created before the visible world (Psychol. S. 63; Genesis, S. 105), as is indeed not taught here, but still (vid., on the other hand, Hofmann, Schriftbew. i. 400) is assumed. For &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; are, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/1.htm">Job 1-2</a>, the angels, who proceeded from God by a mode of creation which is likened to begetting, and who with Him form one &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769; (Genesis, S. 121). The "morning stars," however, are mentioned in connection with them, because between the stars and the angels, which are both comprehended in &#1510;&#1489;&#1488; &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; (Genesis, S. 128), a mysterious connection exists, which is manifoldly attested in Holy Scripture (vid., on the other hand, Hofm. ib. S. 318). &#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1499;&#1489; &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512; is the morning star which in <a href="/isaiah/14-12.htm">Isaiah 14:12</a> is called &#1492;&#1497;&#1500;&#1500; (as extra-bibl. &#1504;&#1490;&#1492;&#1468;) from its dazzling light, which exceeds all other stars in brightness, and &#1489;&#1468;&#1503;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1512;, son of the dawn, because it swims in the dawn as though it were born from it. It was just the dawn of the world coming into being, which is the subject spoken of, that gave rise to the mention of the morning star; the plur., however, does not mean the stars which came into being on that morning of the world collectively (Hofm., Schlottm.), but Lucifer with the stars his peers, as &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/13-10.htm">Isaiah 13:10</a>, Orion and the stars his peers. Arab. suhayl (Canopus) is used similarly as a generic name for stars of remarkable brilliancy, and in general suhe&#770;l is to the nomads and the Hauranites the symbol of what is brilliant, glorious, and beautiful; <p>(Note: A man or woman of great beauty is called suhe&#770;li, suhel&#305;&#770;je. Thus I heard a Hauranitish woman say to her companion: naha&#770;r el-jo&#770;m neda&#770;, shuft ledsch (Arab. lk) wa&#770;hid Suhe&#770;li, To-day is dew, I saw a Suhe&#770;li, i.e., a very handsome man, for thee. - Wetzst.)<p>so that even the beings of light of the first rank among the celestial spirits might be understood by &#1499;&#1493;&#1499;&#1489;&#1497; &#1489;&#1511;&#1512;. But if this ought to be the meaning, <a href="/job/38-7.htm">Job 38:7</a> and <a href="/job/38-7.htm">Job 38:7</a> would be in an inverted order. They are actual stars, whether it is intended of the sphere belonging to the earth or to the higher sphere comprehended in &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="/genesis/1-1.htm">Genesis 1:1</a>. Joy and light are reciprocal notions, and the scale of the tones of joy is likened to the scale of light and colours; therefore the fulness of light, in which the morning stars shone forth all together at the founding of the earth, may symbolize one grandly harmonious song of joy. </body></html>
