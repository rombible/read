Elihu had silenced Job, but had not brought him to admit his guilt before God. It pleased the Lord to interpose. The Lord, in this discourse, humbles Job, and brings him to repent of his passionate expressions concerning God's providential dealings with him; and this he does, by calling upon Job to compare God's being from everlasting to everlasting, with his own time; God's knowledge of all things, with his own ignorance; and God's almighty power, with his own weakness. Our darkening the counsels of God's wisdom with our folly, is a great provocation to God. Humble faith and sincere obedience see farthest and best into the will of the Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/38.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Who is this - Referring doubtless to Job, for he is specified in the previous verse. Some have understood it of Elihu (see Schultens), but the connection evidently demands that it should be understood as referring to Job. The object was, to reprove him for the presumptuous manner in which he had spoken of God and of his government. It was important before God manifested his approval of Job, that he should declare his sense of what he had said, and show him how improper it was to indulge in language such as he had used.<p>That darkeneth counsel - That makes the subject darker. Instead of explaining the reason of the divine dealings, and vindicating God from the objections alleged against him and his government, the only tendency of what he had said had been to make his government appear dark, and severe, and unjust in the view of his friends. It might have been expected of Job, being a friend of God, that all that he said would have tended to inspire confidence in him, and to explain and vindicate the divine dealings; but, God had seen much that was the very reverse. Even the true friends of God, in the dark times of trial, may say much that will tend to make people doubt the wisdom and goodness of his government, and to prejudice the minds of the wicked against him.<p>By words without knowledge - Words that did not contain a true explanation of the difficulty. They conveyed no light about his dealings; they did not tend to satisfy the mind, or to make the subject more clear than it was before. There is much of this kind of speaking in the world; much that is written, and much that fails from the lips in debate, in preaching, and in conversation, that explains nothing, and that even leaves the subject more perplexed than it was before. We see from this verse that God does not and cannot approve of such "words." If his friends speak, they should vindicate his government; they should at least express their conviction that he is right; they should aim to explain his doings, and to show to the world that they are reasonable. If they cannot do this, they should adore in silence. The Savior never spoke of God in such a way as to leave any doubt that his ways could be vindicated, never so as to leave the impression that he was harsh or severe in his administration, or so as to lend the least countenance to a spirit of murmuring and complaining. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/38.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. this&#8212;Job.<p>counsel&#8212;impugning My divine wisdom in the providential arrangements of the universe.

Job has not been without fault. He has spoken many "words without knowledge" or with insufficient knowledge, and has thus trenched on irreverence, and given the enemies of God occasion to blaspheme. Moreover, he has "darkened counsel." Instead of making the ways of God clear to his friends and companions, he has east doubts upon God's moral government (<a href="/job/21-7.htm">Job 21:7-26</a>), upon his mercy and loving-kindness (<a href="/job/16-7.htm">Job 16:7-14</a>), almost upon his justice (<a href="/job/19-7.htm">Job 19:7</a>; <a href="/job/31-1.htm">Job 31:1-35</a>). He is thus open to censure, and receives censure, and owns himself "vile" (<a href="/job/40-4.htm">Job 40:4</a>), before peace and reconciliation can be established. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/37.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>17  Thou whose garments became hot,<p>When the land is sultry from the south:<p>18  Dost thou with Him spread out the sky,<p>The strong, as it were molten, mirror?<p>19  Let us know what we shall say to Him! - <p>We can arrange nothing by reason of darkness.<p>20  Shall it be told Him that Ispeak,<p>Or shall one wish to be destroyed?<p>Most expositors connect <a href="/job/37-17.htm">Job 37:17</a> with <a href="/job/37-16.htm">Job 37:16</a> : (Dost thou know) how it comes to pass that ... ; but      &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; after &#1497;&#1491;&#1506; signifies quod, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/11-7.htm">Exodus 11:7</a>, not quomodo, as it sometimes occurs in a comparing antecedent clause, instead of &#1499;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, <a href="/exodus/14-13.htm">Exodus 14:13</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/33-22.htm">Jeremiah 33:22</a>.
