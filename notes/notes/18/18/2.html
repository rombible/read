Why do not you, my brethren, give over discoursing with Job, who is so transported by his passions, as not to be fit to be discoursed with? At least, forbear to proceed till both you and he shall better understand the subject? For, if Bildad be considered as addressing himself to his two companions, he must have meant to reprove them for making use of too long discourses, and to advise them first to consider the subject well, and then to speak directly to the purpose. But many commentators understand him as addressing Job; using here, as also <a href="/job/18-3.htm" title="Why are we counted as beasts, and reputed vile in your sight?">Job 18:3</a>, the plural number, according to the common idiom of the eastern language: which was to speak thus to, or of one person, especially if he were of great eminence.

It is in the plural number, and it is not usual in Hebrew when addressing an individual to make use of the plural form. Some have supposed that it is addressed to Job and to Eliphaz, as being both "long-winded" and tedious in their remarks. Others have supposed that it refers to Job "and the members of his family," who possibly interposed remarks, and joined Job in his complaints. Others suppose that it refers to Eliphaz and Zophar, as being silent during the speech of Job, and not arresting his remarks as they ought to have done. Rosenmuller supposes that it refers to Job and those similar to him, who were mere feigners of piety, and that Bildad means to ask how long it would be before they would be effectually silenced, and their complaints hushed. I see no great difficulty in supposing that the reference is to Job. The whole strain of the discourse evidently supposes it; and there is no evidence that any of the family of Job had spoken, nor does it seem at all probable that Bildad would reprove his own friends either for the length of their speeches, or for not interrupting an other. The custom in the East is to allow a man to utter all that he has to say without interruption.<p>Mark - Hebrew understand; or be intelligent - &#1514;&#1489;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;  ta&#772;b&#305;&#770;ynu&#770;; that is, either speak distinctly, clearly, intelligently; or consider and weigh our arguments. The former is the interpretation of Schultens, and seems to me to be the true one. The idea is this: "You, Job, have been altering mere words. They are words of complaint, without argument. Speak now in a different manner; show that you understand the case; advance arguments that are worthy of attention, and then we will reply." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. ye&#8212;the other two friends of Job, whom Bildad charges with having spoken mere "words," that is, empty speeches; opposed to "mark," that is, come to reason, consider the question intelligently; and then let us speak.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/job/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Ere ye; </span> either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

Because these words are expressed the plural number, some think more persons than one are addressed, either Eliphaz and Job together, who are complained of as taking up all the time, and having all the talk to themselves, that another could scarce put in a word; Bildad could say this with a better grace, because his discourses were but short; or else all his friends, whom he blames for not stopping Job's mouth at once, and for lengthening out the dispute with him; as if he should say, why are you so complaisant to him, to wait till he has done speaking, before you reply? why do not you, without any ceremony, interrupt him, and not suffer him to go on with his prate, a man that is so insufferably rude as to reckon us all as beasts? and to what purpose is it to talk to such a man, that is so hardened and incorrigible, so proud and conceited? it is all labour in vain, and mere beating the air; it is high time to have done talking, and to put an end to the dispute, when things are such a pass with him as they are: or else the words are directed to Job, and his friends that were with him, who might now and then speak a word in his behalf, though their words are not recorded; or, however, by their looks or gestures might show their approbation of Job's defences: that there were others present besides Job and his three friends, it is probable; yea, it is certain that Elihu was present all the while, but he was not altogether of Job's mind; nor does it appear that he had any to take his part, for his brethren, acquaintance, kinsfolk, and familiar friends, stood at a distance from him, and his maids and menservants used him ill; and even his own wife was not very kind to him, as he declares in the following chapter; wherefore it seems best of all to understand these words as spoken to Job alone, the plural being used for the singular, according to the idiom of the tongue in which they were spoken, and so are a charge of loquacity against him for talking too much, and too long, unless it had been to better purpose; and in like manner Bildad begins his first reply to Job, <a href="/job/8-2.htm">Job 8:2</a>; a late interpreter renders the words, "how long will you lay snares with words" (e)? use cautious words, set snares with words to catch, lie upon the catch, and lay hold upon a word, and improve it to disadvantage, which is imprudently or inadvertently dropped: <p>mark, and afterwards we will speak; or "let us speak" (f); after we have well considered things, got a right understanding of them, and thoroughly digested them, and have well concerted things, and have thought very closely what reply to make to them; and so the words are a tacit reflection of Bildad's on his other two friends, that they spoke before they thought, and therefore some things impertinently, which Job took the advantage of against them; wherefore it would be right, for the future, to mark and consider things well beforehand, and then speak, as they then would with greater propriety, and more to the purpose: public speakers especially, or such who are engaged in public service, or in a public dispute, should meditate beforehand what to say, lest they deliver what is crude and undigested, and may be turned against them. Our Lord indeed directed his disciples, when called before kings and, governors for his sake, not to premeditate what they should answer; but that was an extraordinary case, and they were promised to have extraordinary assistance, whereby some great ends were to be answered, the confusion of their enemies, and the confirmation of the Christian religion. But the words seem rather directed to Job, and to carry in them a charge of inattention to what was said to him by his friends; and therefore Bildad exhorts him to mark and observe what they said to him, to listen attentively to that, and well consider it, and then it would be an encouragement to them to proceed in discoursing with him. Job is represented like some hearers, that stop their ears to the voice of the charmer charming ever so wisely; or that are careless and inattentive to what they hear, and let it pass, and never think of it more; whereas hearers of the word should be swift to hear, and listen with attention, and take care that they let not slip what they have heard, and that they meditate upon it in order to get instruction by it, and when they hear in such a manner it is? a encouragement to speak; or else the sense is, "act wisely" (g), like an honest man, and show yourself to be a wise man, a man of understanding, that well weighs and considers things, and rightly takes them in, and receives instruction by them, and talks like a sensible man: "then afterwards we will speak"; or otherwise, if you go on to talk in the foolish manner you do, it is to no purpose to carry on the dispute; the best way is to put an end to it at once. <p>(e) Schultens.

Then he spoke impiously of God, saying that He tore him in His anger (ch. <a href="/job/16-9.htm" title="He tears me in his wrath, who hates me: he gnashes on me with his teeth; my enemy sharpens his eyes on me.">Job 16:9</a>), and appealed to the earth and nature to rise up on his side (ch. <a href="/job/16-18.htm" title="O earth, cover not you my blood, and let my cry have no place.">Job 16:18</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Such things provoke the personal and moral indignation of Bildad alike. It seems to him that Job holds his brethren and him little higher than the beasts (although it was Job himself that was destitute of understanding), and that in his extravagant self-righteousness he flings them away from him as belonging to the class of the “unclean” (<span class="ital"><a href="/context/job/18-2.htm" title="How long will it be ere you make an end of words? mark, and afterwards we will speak....">Job 18:2-3</a></span>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And it is not God that tears him in His anger; rather in his outrageous fury he is tearing himself.

(<span class="ital"><a href="/job/18-4.htm" title="He tears himself in his anger: shall the earth be forsaken for you? and shall the rock be removed out of his place?">Job 18:4</a></span>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This question naturally leads over to the principal theme of the discourse, the certainty of the destruction of the wicked through the operation of the fixed order of the world and the moral instincts of mankind (<span class="ital"><a href="/context/job/18-5.htm" title="Yes, the light of the wicked shall be put out, and the spark of his fire shall not shine....">Job 18:5-21</a></span>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">ere you make an end of words</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">how long will ye hunt for words</span>, lit. <span class="ital">set snares for words</span>.

By “hunting for words” he means making subtle and artificial attempts at finding arguments—which were only words. He probably refers to the distinctions which Job, in wrestling with his great problem, drew between God and God, and his appeals to the one against the other. Such things seem subtleties to Bildad and but the theme of speakers; man’s destiny in the world of God is a thing of more solid stuff, and its principles not so intangible.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">mark, and afterwards</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">understand</span>. Bildad gives back Job’s words, Thou hast hid their heart from understanding, ch. <a href="/job/17-4.htm" title="For you have hid their heart from understanding: therefore shall you not exalt them.">Job 17:4</a>. It was not they but he that was without wisdom, and until he came to some admission of first principles talking was of little avail.

He means that they deceive themselves concerning the actual state of the case before them; for in reality he is meeting death without being deceived, or allowing himself to be deceived, about the matter. His appeal is similar to <a href="/job/6-29.htm">Job 6:29</a>. Carey translates correctly: Attack me again with another round of arguments, etc. Instead of &#1493;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1501;, as it is written everywhere else (generally when the speech is drawing to a close), we find &#1493;&#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1501; (as the form of writing &#1488;&#1500;&#1501;, &#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1501; occurs also in the subst. &#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1501;), perh. in order to harmonize with &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1501;, which is here according to rule instead of &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1499;&#1501;, which corresponds more to our form of a vocative clause, just as in <a href="/1_kings/22-28.htm">1 Kings 22:28</a>; <a href="/micah/1-2.htm">Micah 1:2</a> (Ewald, 327, a).<p>(Note: Comp. my Anekdota zur Gesch. der mittelalterlichen Scholastik unter Juden und Moslemen (1841), S. 380.)<p>In &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468; the jussive and imper. (for the Chethib &#1497;&#1489;&#1488;&#1497;, which occurs in some Codd. and editions, is meaningless) are united, the former being occasioned by the arrangement of the words, which is unfavourable to the imper. (comp. Ew. 229); moreover, the first verb gives the adverbial notion iterum, denuo to the second, according to Ges. 142, 3, a.<p>What follows, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/17-11.htm">Job 17:11</a>, is the confirmation of the fact that there is no wise man among them who might be able to give him efficient solace by a right estimate of the magnitude and undeservedness of his suffering. His life is indeed run out; and the most cherished plans and hopes which he had hedged in and fostered for the future in his heart, he has utterly and long since given up. The plur. (occurring only here) of &#1494;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;, which occurs also sensu malo, signifies projects, as &#1502;&#1494;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, <a href="/job/21-27.htm">Job 21:27</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/42-2.htm">Job 42:2</a>, from &#1494;&#1502;&#1501;, to tie; Aben-Ezra refers to the Arab. zama&#770;m (a thread, band, esp. a rein). These plans which are now become useless, these cherished thoughts, he calls &#1502;&#1493;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;, peculia (from &#1497;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;, to take possession of) of his heart. Thus, after Obad. Oba 1:17, Gecatilia (in Aben-Ezra) also explains, while, according to Ewald, Beitrge, S. 98, he understands the heart-strings, i.e., the trunks of the arteries (for thus is Arab. n't to be explained), and consequently, as Ewald himself, and even Farisol, most improbably combines &#1502;&#1493;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; with &#1502;&#1493;&#1514;&#1512; (&#1497;&#1514;&#1512;). Similarly the lxx &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b1; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;, as though the joints (instead of the valves) of the heart were intended; probably with Middeldorpf, after the Syriac Hexapla, &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1; is to be read instead of &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;; this, however, rests upon a mistaking of &#1502;&#1493;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; for &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;. While he is now almost dead, and his life-plans of the future are torn away (&#1504;&#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;), the friends turn night into day (&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1501;, as <a href="/isaiah/5-20.htm">Isaiah 5:20</a>); light is (i.e., according to their opinion) nearer than the face of darkness, i.e., than the darkness which is in reality turned to him, and which is as though it stared at him from the immediate future. Thus Nolde explains it as comparative, but connecting <a href="/job/17-12.htm">Job 17:12</a> with &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1502;&#1493;, and considering &#1508;&#1504;&#1497; (which is impossible by this compar. rendering) as meaningless: lucem magis propinquam quam tenebras. It is however possible that &#1502;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497; is used the same as in <a href="/job/23-17.htm">Job 23:17</a> : light is, as they think near before darkness, i.e., while darkness sets in (ingruentibus tenebris), according to which we have translated. If we understand <a href="/job/23-12.htm">Job 23:12</a> from Job's standpoint, and not from that of the friends, &#1502;&#1503; &#1511;&#1512;&#1493;&#1489; is to be explained according to the Arab. qr&#305;&#770;b mn, prope abest ab, as the lxx even translates&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;, which Olympiodorus interprets by &#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#787; &#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;. But by this rendering &#1508;&#1504;&#1497; makes the expression, which really needs investigation, only still lamer. Renderings, however, like Renan's Ah! votre lumire resemble aux tenbres, are removed from all criticism. The subjective rendering, by which <a href="/job/17-12.htm">Job 17:12</a> is under the government of &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1502;&#1493;, is after all the most natural. That he has darkness before him, while the friends present to him the approach of light on condition of penitence, is the thought that is developed in the next strophe. </body></html>
