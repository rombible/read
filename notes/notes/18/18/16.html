The way of sin is the way of fear, and leads to everlasting confusion, of which the present terrors of an impure conscience are earnests, as in Cain and Judas. Miserable indeed is a wicked man's death, how secure soever his life was. See him dying; all that he trusts to for his support shall be taken from him. How happy are the saints, and how indebted to the lord Jesus, by whom death is so far done away and changed, that this king of terrors is become a friend and a servant! See the wicked man's family sunk and cut off. His children shall perish, either with him or after him. Those who consult the true honour of their family, and its welfare, will be afraid of withering all by sin. The judgments of God follow the wicked man after death in this world, as a proof of the misery his soul is in after death, and as an earnest of that everlasting shame and contempt to which he shall rise in the great day. The memory of the just is blessed, but the name of the wicked shall rot, Pr 10:7. It would be well if this report of wicked men would cause any to flee from the wrath to come, from which their power, policy, and riches cannot deliver them. But Jesus ever liveth to deliver all who trust in him. Bear up then, suffering believers. Ye shall for a little time have sorrow, but your Beloved, your Saviour, will see you again; your hearts shall rejoice, and your joy no man taketh away.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>His roots shall be dried up - Another image of complete desolation - where he is compared to a tree that is dead - a figure whose meaning is obvious, and which often occurs; see <a href="//biblehub.com/job/15-30.htm">Job 15:30</a>, note; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/8-12.htm">Job 8:12-13</a>, notes.<p>Above his branch - Perhaps referring to his children or family.

Wicked men are sometimes compared to trees; to trees of the wood, barren, and unfruitful; to trees without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots; and sometimes to green bay trees, very flourishing for a while, and which on a sudden perish, and come to nothing, see Sol 2:3, Jde 1:12; and such a simile is here used; and by his roots may be meant his family, from whence he sprung, which now should be extinct with him, see <a href="/isaiah/11-1.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>; or his substance, which being greatly increased, he seemed to take root in the earth, and not only to be in a prosperous, but in a stable settled condition; but now, like Ephraim, he should be smitten, and his root dried up; all his wealth, and all the resources of it, should be exhausted, be no more, see <a href="/jeremiah/12-2.htm">Jeremiah 12:2</a>; <p>and above shall his branch be cut off; his children that sprung from him, as branches from a tree, and were his glory and beauty, these should be cut off; referring no doubt in both clauses to Job's present circumstances, whose root in the time of his prosperity was spread out by the waters, but now dried up, and on whose branches the dew lay all night, but now cut off, <a href="/job/29-19.htm">Job 29:19</a>; so the Targum, <p>"his children shall be cut off out of the earth, and from heaven his destruction shall be decreed;'' <p>both clauses signify the utter destruction of the family of the wicked man, root and branch, see <a href="/malachi/4-1.htm">Malachi 4:1</a>.

The tree is not a figure for the sinner as a single person, but as the centre of a family, widely ramified and firmly established (his roots), and numerous (his branches). These all perish with him, cf.

The same thing is said in <a href="/job/18-8.htm">Job 18:8</a>; the way on which he complacently wanders up and down (which the Hithp. signifies here) is &#1513;&#1474;&#1489;&#1499;&#1492;, lattice-work, here a snare (Arab. schabacah, a net, from &#1513;&#1474;&#1489;&#1498;, schabaca, to intertwine, weave), and consequently will suddenly break in and bring him to ruin. This fact of delivering himself over to destruction is established in apocopated futt. (<a href="/job/18-9.htm">Job 18:9</a>) used as praes., and without the voluntative signification in accordance with the poetic licence: a trap catches a heel (poetic brevity for: the trap catches his heel), a noose seizes upon him, &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; (but with the accompanying notion of overpowering him, which the translation "bind" is intended to express). Such is the meaning of &#1510;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; here, which is not plur., but sing., from &#1510;&#1502;&#1501; (Arab. d&#803;mm), to tie, and it unites in itself the meanings of snare-layer (<a href="/job/5-5.htm">Job 5:5</a>) and of snare; the form (as &#1488;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;, &#1488;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;) corresponds more to the former, but does not, however, exclude the latter, as &#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503; and &#1500;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491; (&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c2;) show.<p>The continuation in <a href="/job/18-10.htm">Job 18:10</a> of the figure of the fowler affirms that that issue of his life (<a href="/job/18-9.htm">Job 18:9</a>) has been preparing long beforehand; the prosperity of the evil-doer from the beginning tends towards ruin. Instead of &#1495;&#1489;&#1500;&#1493; we have the pointing &#1495;&#1489;&#1500;&#1493;, as it would be in Arab. in a similar sense hhabluhu (from hhabl, a cord, a net). The nearer destruction is now to him, the stronger is the hold which his foreboding has over him, since, as <a href="/job/18-11.htm">Job 18:11</a> adds, terrible thoughts (&#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1514;) and terrible apparitions fill him with dismay, and haunt him, following upon his feet. &#1500;&#1512;&#1490;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;, close behind him, as <a href="/genesis/30-30.htm">Genesis 30:30</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/25-42.htm">1 Samuel 25:42</a>; <a href="/isaiah/41-2.htm">Isaiah 41:2</a>; <a href="/habakkuk/3-5.htm">Habakkuk 3:5</a>. The best authorized pointing of the verb is &#1493;&#1492;&#1508;&#1497;&#1510;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;, with Segol (Ges. 104, 2, c), Chateph-Segol, and Kibbutz. Except in <a href="//biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-14.htm">Habakkuk 3:14</a>, where the prophet includes himself with his people, &#1492;&#1508;&#1497;&#1509;, diffundere, dissipare (vid., <a href="/job/37-11.htm">Job 37:11</a>; <a href="/job/40-11.htm">Job 40:11</a>), never has a person as its obj. elsewhere. It would also probably not be used, but for the idea that the spectres of terror pursue him at every step, and are now here, now there, and his person is as it were multiplied. </body></html>
