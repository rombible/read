Though Bildad thought the application of it to Job was easy, yet it was not safe nor just. It is common for angry disputants to rank their opponents among God's enemies, and to draw wrong conclusions from important truths. The destruction of the wicked is foretold. That destruction is represented under the similitude of a beast or bird caught in a snare, or a malefactor taken into custody. Satan, as he was a murderer, so he was a robber, from the beginning. He, the tempter, lays snares for sinners wherever they go. If he makes them sinful like himself, he will make them miserable like himself. Satan hunts for the precious life. In the transgression of an evil man there is a snare for himself, and God is preparing for his destruction. See here how the sinner runs himself into the snare.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The gin - Another method of taking wild beasts. It was a snare so made as to spring suddenly on an animal, securing him by the neck or feet. We use a trap for the same purpose. The Hebrew word (&#1508;&#1495;  pach) may denote anything of this kind - a snare, net, noose, etc. with which birds or wild animals are taken.<p>By the heel - By the foot.<p>And the robber shall prevail - He shall be overpowered by the highwayman; or the plunderer shall make a sudden descent upon him, and strip him of his all. The meaning is, that destruction would suddenly overtake him.

Fifty years ago man-traps were commonly set at night in gardens and orchards in this country, which held intending thieves until the proprietor came and took them before a magistrate in the morning. (On the employment of such traps in antiquity, see Herod., 2:121. &sect; 2.) <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/18.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>  1  Then began Bildad the Shuhite, and said:<p>  2  How long will ye hunt for words?!<p>Attend, and afterwards we will speak.<p>  3  Wherefore are we accounted as beasts,<p>And narrow-minded in your eyes?<p>Job's speeches are long, and certainly are a trial of patience to the three, and the heaviest trial to Bildad, whose turn now comes on, because he is at pains throughout to be brief. Hence the reproach of endless babbling with which he begins here, as at <a href="//biblehub.com/job/8-2.htm">Job 8:2</a>, when he at last has an opportunity of speaking; in connection with which it must, however, not be forgotten that Job also, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/16-3.htm">Job 16:3</a>, satirically calls upon them to cease. He is indeed more entitled than his opponents to the entreaty not to weary him with long speeches. The question, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/18-2.htm">Job 18:2</a>, if &#1511;&#1504;&#1510;&#1497; six derived from &#1511;&#1509;, furnishes no sense, unless perhaps it is, with Ralbag, explained: how long do you make close upon close in order, when you seem to have come to an end, to begin continually anew? For to give the thought: how long do you make no end of speaking, it must have been &#1500;&#1488; &#1506;&#1491;&#1470;&#1488;&#1504;&#1492;, as the lxx (&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9; &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#787; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#837;:) involuntarily inserts the negative. And what should the plur. mean by this rendering? The form &#1511;&#1504;&#1510;&#1497;  equals  &#1511;&#1510;&#1468;&#1497; would not cause doubt; for though &#1511;&#1510;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; does not occur elsewhere in the Old Testament, it is nevertheless sufficient that it is good Aramaic (&#1511;&#1510;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503;), and that another Hebr. plural, as &#1511;&#1510;&#1497;, &#1511;&#1510;&#1493;&#1497;, &#1511;&#1510;&#1493;&#1493;&#1514;, would have been hardly in accordance with the usage of the language. But the plural would not be suitable here generally, the over-delicate explanation of Ralbag perhaps excepted. Since the book of Job abounds in Arabisms, and in Arabic qanas&#803;a (as synon. of s&#803;a&#770;d) signifies venari, venando capere, and qans&#803;un (maqnas&#803;un) cassis, rete venatorium; since, further, &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1501; &#1511;&#1504;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501; (comp. &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1512;&#1489;, <a href="/jeremiah/9-7.htm">Jeremiah 9:7</a>) is an incontrovertible reading, and all the difficulties in connection with the reference to &#1511;&#1509; lying in the &#1506;&#1491;&#1470;&#1488;&#1504;&#1492; for &#1506;&#1491;&#1470;&#1488;&#1504;&#1492; &#1500;&#1488; and in the plur. vanish, we translate with Castell., Schultens, J. D. Mich., and most modern expositors: how long (here not different from <a href="/job/8-2.htm">Job 8:2</a>; <a href="/job/19-2.htm">Job 19:2</a>) will ye lay snares (construction, as also by the other rendering, like <a href="/job/24-5.htm">Job 24:5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/36-16.htm">Job 36:16</a>, according to Ges. 116, 1) for words; which, however, is not equivalent to hunt for words in order to contradict, but in order to talk on continually.<p>(Note: In post-bibl. Hebrew, &#1511;&#1504;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501; has become common in the signification, proofs, arguments, as e.g., a Karaitic poet says, &#1493;&#1497;&#1495;&#1493;&#1491; &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1498; &#1489;&#1511;&#1504;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501; &#1492;&#1511;&#1497;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;, the oneness of thy name have I upheld with proofs; vid., Pinsker, Likute Kadmoniot. Zur Gesch. des Karaismus und der karischen Literatur, 1860, S. &#1511;&#1505;&#1493;.)<p>Job is the person addressed, for Bildad agrees with the two others. It is remarkable, however, that he addresses Job with "you." Some say that he thinks of Job as one of a number; Ewald observes that the controversy becomes more wide and general; and Schlottm. conjectures that Bildad fixes his eye on individuals of his hearers, on whose countenances he believed he saw a certain inclination to side with Job. This conjecture we will leave to itself; but the remark which Schlottm. also makes, that Bildad regards Job as a type of a whole class, is correct, only one must also add, this address in the plur. is a reply to Job's sarcasm by a similar one. As Job has told the friends that they act as if they were mankind in general, and all wisdom were concentrated in them, so Bildad has taken it amiss that Job connects himself with the whole of the truly upright, righteous, and pure; and he addresses him in the plural, because he, the unit, has puffed himself up as such a collective whole. This wrangler - he means - with such a train behind him, cannot accomplish anything: Oh that you would understand (&#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1503;, as e.g., <a href="//biblehub.com/job/42-3.htm">Job 42:3</a>, not causative, as <a href="/job/6-24.htm">Job 6:24</a>), i.e., come to your senses, and afterward we will speak, i.e., it is only then possible to walk in the way of understanding. That is not now possible, when he, as one who plays the part of their many, treats them, the three who are agreed in opposition to him, as totally void of understanding, and each one of them unwise, in expressions like <a href="//biblehub.com/job/17-4.htm">Job 17:4</a>, <a href="/job/17-10.htm">Job 17:10</a>. Looking to <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/49-13.htm">Psalm 49:13</a>, 21, one might be tempted to regard &#1504;&#1496;&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; (on the vowel  instead of , vid., Ges. 75, rem. 7) as an interchange of consonants from &#1504;&#1491;&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;: be silent, make an end, ye profligati; but the supposition of this interchange of consonants would be arbitrary. On the other hand, there is no suitable thought in "why are we accounted unclean?" (Vulg. sorduimus), from &#1496;&#1502;&#1492;  equals  &#1496;&#1502;&#1488;, <a href="/leviticus/11-43.htm">Leviticus 11:43</a> (Ges. 75, vi.); the complaint would have no right connection, except it were a very slight one, with <a href="/job/17-9.htm">Job 17:9</a>. On the contrary, if we suppose a verb &#1496;&#1502;&#1492; in the signification opplere, obturare, which is peculiar to this consonant-combination in the whole range of the Semitic languages (comp. &#1488;&#1470;&#1496;&#1501;, Arab. 't&#803;m, obstruere, Aram. &#1496;&#1502;&#1468;&#1501;, &#1496;&#1502;&#1496;&#1501;, Arab. t&#803;mm, e.g., Talm.: transgression stoppeth up, &#1502;&#1496;&#1502;&#1496;&#1502;&#1514;, man's heart), and after which this &#1496;&#1502;&#1492; has been explained by the Jewish expositors (Raschi: &#1504;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1504;&#1493; &#1496;&#1502;&#1493;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;), and is interpreted by &#1505;&#1514;&#1501; (Parchon: &#1504;&#1505;&#1514;&#1502;&#1492; &#1491;&#1506;&#1514;&#1504;&#1493;), we gain a sense which corresponds both with previous reproaches of Job and the parallelism, and we decide in its favour with the majority of modern expositors. With the interrogative Wherefore, Bildad appeals to Job's conscience. These invectives proceed from an impassioned self-delusion towards the truth, which he wards off from himself, but cannot however alter. </body></html>
