The way of sin is the way of fear, and leads to everlasting confusion, of which the present terrors of an impure conscience are earnests, as in Cain and Judas. Miserable indeed is a wicked man's death, how secure soever his life was. See him dying; all that he trusts to for his support shall be taken from him. How happy are the saints, and how indebted to the lord Jesus, by whom death is so far done away and changed, that this king of terrors is become a friend and a servant! See the wicked man's family sunk and cut off. His children shall perish, either with him or after him. Those who consult the true honour of their family, and its welfare, will be afraid of withering all by sin. The judgments of God follow the wicked man after death in this world, as a proof of the misery his soul is in after death, and as an earnest of that everlasting shame and contempt to which he shall rise in the great day. The memory of the just is blessed, but the name of the wicked shall rot, Pr 10:7. It would be well if this report of wicked men would cause any to flee from the wrath to come, from which their power, policy, and riches cannot deliver them. But Jesus ever liveth to deliver all who trust in him. Bear up then, suffering believers. Ye shall for a little time have sorrow, but your Beloved, your Saviour, will see you again; your hearts shall rejoice, and your joy no man taketh away.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>His remembrance shall perish - His name - all recollection of him. Calamity shall follow him even after death; and that which every man desires, and every good man has, and honored name when he is dead, will be denied him. Men will hasten to forget him as fast as possible; compare <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/10-7.htm">Proverbs 10:7</a>, "The name of the wicked shall rot."<p>No name in the street - Men when they meet together in highways and places of concourse - when traveler meets traveler, and caravan caravan, shall not pause to speak of him and of the loss which society has substained by his death. It is one of the rewards of virtue that the good will speak of the upright man when he is dead; that they will pause in their journey, or in their business, to converse about him; and that the poor and the needy will dwell with affectionate interest upon their loss. "This" blessing, Bildad says, will be denied the wicked man. The world will not feel that they have any loss to deplore when he is dead. No great plan of benvolence has been arrested by his removal. The poor and the needy fare as well as they did before. The widow and the fatherless make no grateful remembrance of his name, and the world hastens to forget him as soon as possible. There is no man, except one who is lost to all virtue, who does not desire to be remembered when he is dead - by his children, his neighbors, his friends, and by the stranger who may read the record on the stone that marks his grave. Where this desire is "wholly" extinguished, man has reached the lowest possible point of degradation, and the last hold on him in favor of virtue has expired. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17. street&#8212;Men shall not speak of him in meeting in the highways; rather, "in the field" or "meadow"; the shepherds shall no more mention his name&#8212;a picture from nomadic life [Umbreit].<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/job/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Instead of that honour and renown which he designed to have, both whilst he lived, and after his death, he is not so much as remembered, unless it be with contempt and reproach. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/job/18.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>His remembrance shall perish from the earth,.... Not only are the wicked forgotten of God in heaven, and are as the slain he remembers no more, unless it be to pour out his wrath upon them, and punish them for their sins, for which great Babylon will come up in remembrance before him; but of men on earth, and in the very places where they were born, and lived all their days, <a href="/ecclesiastes/8-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:10</a>; yea, those places, houses and palaces, towns and cities, which they have built to perpetuate their memory among men, perish and come to nought, and their memorial with them, <a href="/psalms/9-5.htm">Psalm 9:5</a>; <p>and he shall have no name in the street; much less in the house of God, still less in heaven, in the Lamb's book of life; so far from it, that he shall have none on earth, no good name among men; if ever his name is mentioned after his death, it is with some brand of infamy upon him; he is not spoken of in public, in a court of judicature, nor in any place of commerce and trade, nor in any concourse of people, or public assembly of any note, especially with any credit or commendation; such is the difference between a good man and a wicked man, see <a href="/proverbs/11-7.htm">Proverbs 11:7</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/18.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">His remembrance shall perish from the earth, and he shall have no name in the street.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/job/18.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">17</span>. <span class="ital">perish from the earth</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">from the land</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in the street</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">on the face of the earth</span>.

This is always spoken of in Scripture as a great calamity, one of the greatest that can befall a man. It was felt as such, not only by the Jews, but by the Semitic people generally, whose earnest desire to perpetuate their memory is shown by the elaborate monuments and lengthy inscriptions which they set up in so many places. Arabian poetry, no less than Jewish, is penetrated by the idea. In one point of view it may seem a vulgar ambition; but, in another, it is a pathetic craving alter that continuance which the spirit of man naturally desires, but of which it has, apart from revelation, no assurance. <span class="cmt_word">And he shall have no name in the street</span>; or, <span class="accented">in the world without</span> (comp. <a href="/job/5-10.htm">Job 5:10</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/18.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>  8  For he is driven into the net by his own feet,<p>And he walketh over a snare.<p>  9  The trap holdeth his heel fast,<p>The noose bindeth him.<p>10  His snare lieth hidden in the earth,<p>His nets upon the path;<p>11  Terrors affright him on every side,<p>And scare him at every step.<p>The Pual &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1495; signifies not merely to be betrayed into, but driven into, like the Piel, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/30-12.htm">Job 30:12</a>, to drive away, and as it is to be translated in the similar passage in the song of Deborah, <a href="/judges/5-15.htm">Judges 5:15</a> : "And as Issachar, Barak was driven (i.e., with desire for fighting) behind him down into the valley (the place of meeting under Mount Tabor);" &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1490;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;, which there signifies, according to <a href="/judges/4-10.htm">Judges 4:10</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/8-5.htm">Judges 8:5</a>, "upon his feet  equals  close behind him," is here intended of the intermediate cause: by his own feet he is hurried into the net, i.e., against his will, and yet with his own feet he runs into destruction. The same thing is said in <a href="/job/18-8.htm">Job 18:8</a>; the way on which he complacently wanders up and down (which the Hithp. signifies here) is &#1513;&#1474;&#1489;&#1499;&#1492;, lattice-work, here a snare (Arab. schabacah, a net, from &#1513;&#1474;&#1489;&#1498;, schabaca, to intertwine, weave), and consequently will suddenly break in and bring him to ruin. This fact of delivering himself over to destruction is established in apocopated futt. (<a href="/job/18-9.htm">Job 18:9</a>) used as praes., and without the voluntative signification in accordance with the poetic licence: a trap catches a heel (poetic brevity for: the trap catches his heel), a noose seizes upon him, &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; (but with the accompanying notion of overpowering him, which the translation "bind" is intended to express). Such is the meaning of &#1510;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; here, which is not plur., but sing., from &#1510;&#1502;&#1501; (Arab. d&#803;mm), to tie, and it unites in itself the meanings of snare-layer (<a href="/job/5-5.htm">Job 5:5</a>) and of snare; the form (as &#1488;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;, &#1488;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;) corresponds more to the former, but does not, however, exclude the latter, as &#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503; and &#1500;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491; (&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c2;) show.<p>The continuation in <a href="/job/18-10.htm">Job 18:10</a> of the figure of the fowler affirms that that issue of his life (<a href="/job/18-9.htm">Job 18:9</a>) has been preparing long beforehand; the prosperity of the evil-doer from the beginning tends towards ruin. Instead of &#1495;&#1489;&#1500;&#1493; we have the pointing &#1495;&#1489;&#1500;&#1493;, as it would be in Arab. in a similar sense hhabluhu (from hhabl, a cord, a net). The nearer destruction is now to him, the stronger is the hold which his foreboding has over him, since, as <a href="/job/18-11.htm">Job 18:11</a> adds, terrible thoughts (&#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1514;) and terrible apparitions fill him with dismay, and haunt him, following upon his feet. &#1500;&#1512;&#1490;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;, close behind him, as <a href="/genesis/30-30.htm">Genesis 30:30</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/25-42.htm">1 Samuel 25:42</a>; <a href="/isaiah/41-2.htm">Isaiah 41:2</a>; <a href="/habakkuk/3-5.htm">Habakkuk 3:5</a>. The best authorized pointing of the verb is &#1493;&#1492;&#1508;&#1497;&#1510;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;, with Segol (Ges. 104, 2, c), Chateph-Segol, and Kibbutz. Except in <a href="//biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-14.htm">Habakkuk 3:14</a>, where the prophet includes himself with his people, &#1492;&#1508;&#1497;&#1509;, diffundere, dissipare (vid., <a href="/job/37-11.htm">Job 37:11</a>; <a href="/job/40-11.htm">Job 40:11</a>), never has a person as its obj. elsewhere. It would also probably not be used, but for the idea that the spectres of terror pursue him at every step, and are now here, now there, and his person is as it were multiplied. </body></html>
