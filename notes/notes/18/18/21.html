As Bildad designedly uses the singular here, there can be little doubt that he as designedly intended this terrible and cruel picture to represent Job himself.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/job/18.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>18:11-21 Bildad describes the destruction wicked people are kept for, in the other world, and which in some degree, often seizes them in this world. The way of sin is the way of fear, and leads to everlasting confusion, of which the present terrors of an impure conscience are earnests, as in Cain and Judas. Miserable indeed is a wicked man's death, how secure soever his life was. See him dying; all that he trusts to for his support shall be taken from him. How happy are the saints, and how indebted to the lord Jesus, by whom death is so far done away and changed, that this king of terrors is become a friend and a servant! See the wicked man's family sunk and cut off. His children shall perish, either with him or after him. Those who consult the true honour of their family, and its welfare, will be afraid of withering all by sin. The judgments of God follow the wicked man after death in this world, as a proof of the misery his soul is in after death, and as an earnest of that everlasting shame and contempt to which he shall rise in the great day. The memory of the just is blessed, but the name of the wicked shall rot, Pr 10:7. It would be well if this report of wicked men would cause any to flee from the wrath to come, from which their power, policy, and riches cannot deliver them. But Jesus ever liveth to deliver all who trust in him. Bear up then, suffering believers. Ye shall for a little time have sorrow, but your Beloved, your Saviour, will see you again; your hearts shall rejoice, and your joy no man taketh away.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked - The conclusion or sum of the whole matter. The meaning is, that the habitations of all that knew not God would be desolate - a declaration which Job could not but regard as aimed at himself; compare <a href="/job/20-29.htm">Job 20:29</a>. This is the close of this harsh and severe speech. It is no wonder that Job should feel it keenly, and that he "did" feel it is apparent from the following chapter. A string of proverbs has been presented, having the appearance of proof, and as the result of the long observation of the course of events, evidently bearing on his circumstances, and so much in point that he could not well deny their pertinency to his condition. He was stung to the quick, and and gave vent to his agonized feelings in the following chapter. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21.

Step by step it traces his course to the total destruction, which leaves no trace of him, but still bears evident marks of being the fulfilment of the curse pronounced upon him. In opposition to this explanation, Targ., Raschi, and others, explain &#1488;&#1504;&#1493; according to <a href="/genesis/49-3.htm">Genesis 49:3</a> : the son of his manhood's strength becomes hungry, which sounds comical rather than tragic; another Targ. transl.: he becomes hungry in his mourning, which is indeed inadmissible, because the signif. planctus, luctus, belongs to the derivatives of &#1488;&#1504;&#1492;, &#1488;&#1504;&#1503;, but not to &#1488;&#1493;&#1503;. But even the translation recently adopted by Ew., Stick., and Schlottm., "his strength becomes hungry," is unsatisfactory; for it is in itself no misfortune to be hungry, and &#1512;&#1506;&#1489; does not in itself signify "exhausted with hunger." It is also an odd metaphor, that strength becomes hungry; we would then rather read with Reiske, &#1512;&#1506;&#1489; &#1489;&#1488;&#1504;&#1493;, famelicus in media potentia sua. But as &#1488;&#1493;&#1503; signifies strength (<a href="/job/18-7.htm">Job 18:7</a>), so &#1488;&#1493;&#1503; (root &#1488;&#1503;, to breathe and pant) signifies both wickedness and evil (the latter either as evil  equals  calamity, or as anhelitus, sorrow, Arab. ain); and the thought that his (i.e., appointed to the evil-doer) calamity is hungry to swallow him up (Syr., Hirz., Hahn, and others), suits the parallelism perfectly: "and misfortune stands ready for his fall."<p>(Note: If &#1512;&#1506;&#1489; elsewhere corresponds to the Arabic rugb, to be voraciously hungry, the Arab. ra&#8219;b, to be paralyzed with fright, might correspond to it in the present passage: "from all sides spectres alarm him (&#1489;&#1506;&#1514;&#1492;&#1493; from &#1489;&#1506;&#1514;  equals  Arab. bgt, to fall suddenly upon any one; or better:  equals  b&#8219;t&#817;, to hunt up, excitare, to cause to rise, to fill with alarm) and urge him forward, seizing on his heels; then his strength becomes a paralyzing fright (&#1512;&#1506;&#1489;), and destruction is ready to overwhelm him." The ro&#8219;b (&#1512;&#1506;&#1489;, thus in Damascus) or ra&#8219;b (&#1512;&#1506;&#1489;, thus in Hauran and among the Beduins) is a state of mind which only occurs among us in a lower degree, but among the Arabs it is worthy of note as a psychological fact. If the wahm (Arab. 'l-whm), or idea of some great and inevitable danger or misfortune, overpowers the Arab, all strength of mind and body suddenly forsakes him, so that he breaks down powerless and defenceless. Thus on July 8, 1860, in Damascus, in a few hours, about 6000 Christian men were slain, without any one raising a hand or uttering a cry for mercy. Both European and native doctors have assured me the ro&#8219;b in Arabia kills, and I have witnessed instances myself. Since it often produces a stiffness of the limbs with chronic paralysis, all kinds of paralysis are called ro&#8219;b, and the paralytics mar&#8219;u&#770;b. - Wetzst.)<p>&#1488;&#1497;&#1491; signifies prop. a weight, burden, then a load of suffering, and gen. calamity (root &#1488;&#1491;, Arab. a&#770;da, e.g., Sur. 2, 256, la jaa&#770;duhu, it is not difficult for him, and adda, comp. on <a href="/psalms/31-12.htm">Psalm 31:12</a>); and &#1500;&#1510;&#1500;&#1506;&#1493; not: at his side (Ges., Ew., Schlottm., Hahn), but, according to <a href="/psalms/35-15.htm">Psalm 35:15</a>; <a href="/psalms/38-18.htm">Psalm 38:18</a> : for his fall (lxx freely, but correctly: &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#986;); for instead of "at the side" (Arab. ila ganbi), they no more say in Hebrew than in Germ. "at the ribs."<p><a href="/job/18-13.htm">Job 18:13</a> figuratively describes how calamity takes possession of him. The members, which are called &#1497;&#1510;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/17-7.htm">Job 17:7</a>, as parts of the form of the body, are here called &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, as the parts into which the body branches out, or rather, since the word originally signifies a part, as that which is actually split off (vid., on <a href="//biblehub.com/job/17-16.htm">Job 17:16</a>, where it denotes "cross-bars"), or according to appearance that which rises up, and from this primary signification applied to the body and plants, the members (not merely as Farisol interprets: the veins) of which the body consists and into which it is distributed. &#1506;&#1493;&#1512; (distinct from &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1491;, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/16-15.htm">Job 16:15</a>, similar in meaning to Arab. baschar, but also to the Arab. gild, of which the former signifies rather the epidermis, the latter the skin in the widest sense) is the soluble surface of the naked animal body. &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1493;&#1512; &#1502;&#1493;&#1514; devours this, and indeed, as the repetition implies, gradually, but surely and entirely. "The first-born of the poor," <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/14-30.htm">Isaiah 14:30</a>, are those not merely who belong (&#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;) to the race of the poor, but the poor in the highest sense and first rank. So here diseases are conceived of as children of death, as in the Arabic malignant fevers are called bena&#770;t el-men&#305;&#770;jeh, daughters of fate or death; that disease which Bildad has in his mind, as the one more terrible and dangerous than all others, he calls the "first-born of death," as that in which the whole destroying power of death is contained, as in the first-born the whole strength of his parent.<p>(Note: In Arabic the positive is expressed in the same metonymies with abu, e.g., abu&#770; 'l-che&#770;r, the benevolent; on the other hand, e.g., ibn el&#775;hha&#770;ge is much stronger than abu 'l-hha&#770;ge: the person who is called ibn is conceived of as a child of these conditions; they belong to his inmost nature, and have not merely affected him slightly and passed off. The Hebrew &#1489;&#1499;&#1493;&#1512; represents the superlative, because among Semites the power and dignity of the father is transmitted to the first-born. So far as I know, the Arab does not use this superlative; for what is terrible and revolting he uses "mother," e.g., umm el-fa&#770;ritt, mother of death, a name for the plague (in one of the modern popular poets of Damascus), umm el-quashsha&#770;sh, mother of the sweeping death, a name for war (in the same); for that which awakens the emotions of joy and grief he frequently uses "daughter." In an Arabian song of victory the fatal arrows are called bena&#770;t el-mo&#770;t, and the heroes (slayers) in the battle ben&#305;&#770; el-mo&#770;t, which is similar to the figure used in the book of Job. Moreover, that disease which eats up the limbs could not be described by a more appropriate epithet than &#1489;&#1499;&#1493;&#1512; &#1502;&#1493;&#1514;. Its proper name is shunned in common life; and if it is necessary to mention those who are affected with it, they always say sa&#770;da&#770;t el-gudhama&#770; to avoid offending the company, or to escape the curse of the thing mentioned. - Wetzst.)<p>The Targ. understands the figure similarly, since it transl. &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1498; &#1502;&#1493;&#1514;&#1488; (angel of death); another Targ. has instead &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1497; &#1502;&#1493;&#1514;&#1488;, the firstling of death, which is intended in the sense of the primogenita ( equals  praematura) mors of Jerome. Least of all is it to be understood with Ewald as an intensive expression for &#1489;&#1503;&#1470;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;,   <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-31.htm">1 Samuel 20:31</a>, of the evil-doer as liable to death. While now disease in the most fearful form consumes the body of the evil-doer, &#1502;&#1489;&#1496;&#1495;&#1493; (with Dag.f. impl., as <a href="/job/8-14.htm">Job 8:14</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/31-24.htm">Job 31:24</a>, Olsh. 198, b) (a collective word, which signifies everything in which he trusted) is torn away out of his tent; thus also Rosenm., Ew., and Umbr. explain, while Hirz., Hlgst., Schlottm., and Hahn regard &#1502;&#1489;&#1496;&#1495;&#1493; as in apposition to &#1488;&#1492;&#1500;&#1493;, in favour of which <a href="/job/8-14.htm">Job 8:14</a> is only a seemingly suitable parallel. It means everything that made the ungodly man happy as head of a household, and gave him the brightest hopes of the future. This is torn away (evellitur) from his household, so that he, who is dying off, alone survives. Thus, therefore, <a href="/job/18-14.htm">Job 18:14</a> describes how he also himself dies at last. Several modern expositors, especially Stickel, after the example of Jerome (et calcet super eum quasi rex interitus), and of the Syr. (praecipitem eum reddent terrores regis), take &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1514; as subj., which is syntactically possible (vid., <a href="/job/27-20.htm">Job 27:20</a>; <a href="/job/30-15.htm">Job 30:15</a>): and destruction causes him to march towards itself (Ges.: fugant eum) like a military leader; but since &#1492;&#1510;&#1506;&#1497;&#1491; signifies to cause to approach, and since no &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; (to itself) stands with it, &#1500;&#1502;&#1500;&#1498; is to be considered as denoting the goal, especially as &#1500; never directly signifies instar. In the passage advanced in its favour it denotes that which anything becomes, that which one makes a thing by the mode of treatment (<a href="/job/39-16.htm">Job 39:16</a>), or whither anything extends (e.g., in Schultens on <a href="/job/13-12.htm">Job 13:12</a> : they had claws li-machlbi, i.e., "approaching to the claws" of wild beasts).<p>continued...</body></html>
