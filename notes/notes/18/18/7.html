Though Bildad thought the application of it to Job was easy, yet it was not safe nor just. It is common for angry disputants to rank their opponents among God's enemies, and to draw wrong conclusions from important truths. The destruction of the wicked is foretold. That destruction is represented under the similitude of a beast or bird caught in a snare, or a malefactor taken into custody. Satan, as he was a murderer, so he was a robber, from the beginning. He, the tempter, lays snares for sinners wherever they go. If he makes them sinful like himself, he will make them miserable like himself. Satan hunts for the precious life. In the transgression of an evil man there is a snare for himself, and God is preparing for his destruction.

As a man in health can take large and strong steps, and travel in the greatness of his strength; so in prosperity he can and does take large steps in obtaining fame and reputation among men, in amassing substance to himself, and towards settling his family in the world; he is like one in a large place, and walks at liberty, goes in and out at pleasure, and none can control him; he walks in pride, and with an high and lifted up head, and with contempt of others, and his will is his law, and he does as he pleases; but in adversity, as his strength is weakened in the way, he cannot take the strides he did, his way is hedged up with thorns, he is pressed on every side, and surrounded with troubles, so that, let him turn himself which way he will, he can find no way to escape: <p>and his own counsel shall cast him down; as Ahithophel's and Haman's did, which issued in their ruin, <a href="/2_samuel/17-23.htm">2 Samuel 17:23</a>; what wicked men sometimes plot and devise, with a view to their own good, and the injury of others, proves the destruction of themselves; when they have contrived to raise themselves upon the ruins of others, it has been the means of casting them down from the state and condition they were in, instead of raising to an higher, even down to desolation, and into the most miserable circumstances. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/18.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The steps of his strength shall be straitened, and his own counsel shall cast him down.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/job/18.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">7</span>.

Hence the reproach of endless babbling with which he begins here, as at <a href="//biblehub.com/job/8-2.htm">Job 8:2</a>, when he at last has an opportunity of speaking; in connection with which it must, however, not be forgotten that Job also, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/16-3.htm">Job 16:3</a>, satirically calls upon them to cease. He is indeed more entitled than his opponents to the entreaty not to weary him with long speeches. The question, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/18-2.htm">Job 18:2</a>, if &#1511;&#1504;&#1510;&#1497; six derived from &#1511;&#1509;, furnishes no sense, unless perhaps it is, with Ralbag, explained: how long do you make close upon close in order, when you seem to have come to an end, to begin continually anew? For to give the thought: how long do you make no end of speaking, it must have been &#1500;&#1488; &#1506;&#1491;&#1470;&#1488;&#1504;&#1492;, as the lxx (&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9; &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#787; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#837;:) involuntarily inserts the negative. And what should the plur. mean by this rendering? The form &#1511;&#1504;&#1510;&#1497;  equals  &#1511;&#1510;&#1468;&#1497; would not cause doubt; for though &#1511;&#1510;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; does not occur elsewhere in the Old Testament, it is nevertheless sufficient that it is good Aramaic (&#1511;&#1510;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503;), and that another Hebr. plural, as &#1511;&#1510;&#1497;, &#1511;&#1510;&#1493;&#1497;, &#1511;&#1510;&#1493;&#1493;&#1514;, would have been hardly in accordance with the usage of the language. But the plural would not be suitable here generally, the over-delicate explanation of Ralbag perhaps excepted. Since the book of Job abounds in Arabisms, and in Arabic qanas&#803;a (as synon. of s&#803;a&#770;d) signifies venari, venando capere, and qans&#803;un (maqnas&#803;un) cassis, rete venatorium; since, further, &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1501; &#1511;&#1504;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501; (comp. &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1512;&#1489;, <a href="/jeremiah/9-7.htm">Jeremiah 9:7</a>) is an incontrovertible reading, and all the difficulties in connection with the reference to &#1511;&#1509; lying in the &#1506;&#1491;&#1470;&#1488;&#1504;&#1492; for &#1506;&#1491;&#1470;&#1488;&#1504;&#1492; &#1500;&#1488; and in the plur. vanish, we translate with Castell., Schultens, J. D. Mich., and most modern expositors: how long (here not different from <a href="/job/8-2.htm">Job 8:2</a>; <a href="/job/19-2.htm">Job 19:2</a>) will ye lay snares (construction, as also by the other rendering, like <a href="/job/24-5.htm">Job 24:5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/36-16.htm">Job 36:16</a>, according to Ges. 116, 1) for words; which, however, is not equivalent to hunt for words in order to contradict, but in order to talk on continually.<p>(Note: In post-bibl. Hebrew, &#1511;&#1504;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501; has become common in the signification, proofs, arguments, as e.g., a Karaitic poet says, &#1493;&#1497;&#1495;&#1493;&#1491; &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1498; &#1489;&#1511;&#1504;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501; &#1492;&#1511;&#1497;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;, the oneness of thy name have I upheld with proofs; vid., Pinsker, Likute Kadmoniot. Zur Gesch. des Karaismus und der karischen Literatur, 1860, S. &#1511;&#1505;&#1493;.)<p>Job is the person addressed, for Bildad agrees with the two others. It is remarkable, however, that he addresses Job with "you." Some say that he thinks of Job as one of a number; Ewald observes that the controversy becomes more wide and general; and Schlottm. conjectures that Bildad fixes his eye on individuals of his hearers, on whose countenances he believed he saw a certain inclination to side with Job. This conjecture we will leave to itself; but the remark which Schlottm. also makes, that Bildad regards Job as a type of a whole class, is correct, only one must also add, this address in the plur. is a reply to Job's sarcasm by a similar one. As Job has told the friends that they act as if they were mankind in general, and all wisdom were concentrated in them, so Bildad has taken it amiss that Job connects himself with the whole of the truly upright, righteous, and pure; and he addresses him in the plural, because he, the unit, has puffed himself up as such a collective whole. This wrangler - he means - with such a train behind him, cannot accomplish anything: Oh that you would understand (&#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1503;, as e.g., <a href="//biblehub.com/job/42-3.htm">Job 42:3</a>, not causative, as <a href="/job/6-24.htm">Job 6:24</a>), i.e., come to your senses, and afterward we will speak, i.e., it is only then possible to walk in the way of understanding. That is not now possible, when he, as one who plays the part of their many, treats them, the three who are agreed in opposition to him, as totally void of understanding, and each one of them unwise, in expressions like <a href="//biblehub.com/job/17-4.htm">Job 17:4</a>, <a href="/job/17-10.htm">Job 17:10</a>. Looking to <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/49-13.htm">Psalm 49:13</a>, 21, one might be tempted to regard &#1504;&#1496;&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; (on the vowel  instead of , vid., Ges. 75, rem. 7) as an interchange of consonants from &#1504;&#1491;&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;: be silent, make an end, ye profligati; but the supposition of this interchange of consonants would be arbitrary. On the other hand, there is no suitable thought in "why are we accounted unclean?" (Vulg. sorduimus), from &#1496;&#1502;&#1492;  equals  &#1496;&#1502;&#1488;, <a href="/leviticus/11-43.htm">Leviticus 11:43</a> (Ges. 75, vi.); the complaint would have no right connection, except it were a very slight one, with <a href="/job/17-9.htm">Job 17:9</a>. On the contrary, if we suppose a verb &#1496;&#1502;&#1492; in the signification opplere, obturare, which is peculiar to this consonant-combination in the whole range of the Semitic languages (comp. &#1488;&#1470;&#1496;&#1501;, Arab. 't&#803;m, obstruere, Aram. &#1496;&#1502;&#1468;&#1501;, &#1496;&#1502;&#1496;&#1501;, Arab. t&#803;mm, e.g., Talm.: transgression stoppeth up, &#1502;&#1496;&#1502;&#1496;&#1502;&#1514;, man's heart), and after which this &#1496;&#1502;&#1492; has been explained by the Jewish expositors (Raschi: &#1504;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1504;&#1493; &#1496;&#1502;&#1493;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;), and is interpreted by &#1505;&#1514;&#1501; (Parchon: &#1504;&#1505;&#1514;&#1502;&#1492; &#1491;&#1506;&#1514;&#1504;&#1493;), we gain a sense which corresponds both with previous reproaches of Job and the parallelism, and we decide in its favour with the majority of modern expositors. With the interrogative Wherefore, Bildad appeals to Job's conscience. These invectives proceed from an impassioned self-delusion towards the truth, which he wards off from himself, but cannot however alter. </body></html>
