He allowed that those who had the longest experience should speak first. But God gives wisdom as he pleases; this encouraged him to state his opinion. By attention to the word of God, and dependence upon the Holy Spirit, young men may become wiser than the aged; but this wisdom will render them swift to hear, slow to speak, and disposed to give others a patient hearing.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/32.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I gave ear to your reasons - Margin, "understandings."

With great desire, with great eagerness and earnestness, in hope of meeting with arguments fully satisfying and convincing; he waited for them, as for the rain, and the latter rain, to be revived, refreshed, and edified therewith; and he patiently waited until they had done speaking: <p>I gave ear to your reasons, or "understandings" (r); endeavoured to get into the sense and meaning of their words; not only attended to what they did say, but to what he thought they meant to say: some are not so happy in their expressions; and yet, by what they do say, with close attention it may be understood what they aim at, what is their drift and design; this Elihu was careful to attain unto, not barely to hear their words, but penetrate, if possible, into their meaning: <p>whilst ye searched out what to say; for they did not make their replies to Job immediately, and say what came uppermost at once, but they took time to think of things, and to search out for the most forcible arguments to refute Job, and strengthen their cause; it is very probable they made a pause at the end of every speech of Job's, and considered what was proper to be said in reply, and, perhaps, consulted each other. <p>(r)  "usque ad intellignetias vestras", Pagninus, Montanus, Cocceius, Schultens; "usque ad sensa vestra", Beza, Junius &amp; Tremellius. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/32.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons, whilst ye searched out <span class="cverse3">{g}</span> what to say.</span><p>(g) To prove that Job's affliction came for his sins.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/job/32.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">11</span>. <span class="ital">I gave ear to your reasons</span>] Or, <span class="bld">I listened for your reasons, until ye should search out what to say</span>.

Elihu, directly addressing the three friends, states more clearly his reasons for taking upon him to speak: he had hoped to hear them confute Job, and was disappointed in their arguments; Job may be shewn to be in the wrong, though with different arguments from those they had employed. In Elihu’s opinion the cause of the three friends was much better than their advocacy of it.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, I waited for your words</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "I was full of expectation; I waited impatiently to hear what you would say."

Professor Lee translates, "whilst ye examined <span class="accented">Job's c</span>onclusions; but the Authorized Version is probably correct.

And Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of the three men, then his wrath was kindled. And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite began, and said.<p>He had waited (perf. in the sense of the plusquamperf., Ew. 135, a) for Job with words (&#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; as elsewhere &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503;), i.e., until Job should have spoken his last word in the controversial dialogue. Thus he considered it becoming on his part, for they (&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;, illi, whereas &#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; according to the usage of the language is hi) were older (seniores) than he in days (&#1500;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; as <a href="//biblehub.com/job/32-6.htm">Job 32:6</a>, less harsh here, instead of the acc. of closer definition, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/15-10.htm">Job 15:10</a>, comp. <a href="/job/11-9.htm">Job 11:9</a>). As it now became manifest that the friends made no reply to Job's last speeches for want of the right solution of problem, and therefore also Job had nothing further to say, he believes that he may venture, without any seeming want of courtesy, to give utterance to his long-restrained indignation; and Elihu (with Mahpach) the son of Barach'el (Mercha) the Buzite (with Rebia parvum) began and spoke (&#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; not with Silluk, but Mercha mahpach., and in fact with Mercha on the accented penult., as <a href="//biblehub.com/job/3-2.htm">Job 3:2</a>, and further). </body></html>
