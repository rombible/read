Thus the town of Zahla in the plain of the Lebanon takes its name from the fact that it does not stand out in the plain, but is built close at the foot of the mountain in a corner, and consequently retreats. And zuhale (according to the Kamus) is an animal that creeps backwards into its hole, e.g., the scorpion; and hence, improperly, a man who, as we say with a similar figure, never comes out of his hole, always keeps in his hole, i.e., never leaves his dwelling, as zuhal in general signifies a man who retires or keeps far from active life; in connection with which also the planet Saturn is called Zuhal, the retreating one, on account of its great distance from the rest. Slippery (of ground) is &#1494;&#1495;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;, because it draws the foot backwards (muzhil) by its smoothness, and thus causes the walker to fall. A further formation is &#1494;&#1495;&#1500;&#1511;, to be slippery, and to slip in a slippery place; beside which, &#1494;&#1500;&#1511;, a word of similar meaning, is no longer used in Syria.

The primary notion, to glide (to slip, creep, flow gently, labi), is combined both in the derivatives of the root &#1494;&#1495; and in those of the root &#1494;&#1500; with the notion of a departing and retreating motion. - Wetzst. and Fl.)<p>and &#1491;&#1468;&#1506; for &#1491;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514; (here and <a href="//biblehub.com/job/32-10.htm">Job 32:10</a>, <a href="/job/32-17.htm">Job 32:17</a>; <a href="/job/36-3.htm">Job 36:3</a>; <a href="/job/37-16.htm">Job 37:16</a>) occurs nowhere else in the Old Testament; &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1503; (comp. &#1500;&#1499;&#1503;, <a href="/job/42-3.htm">Job 42:3</a>) is used only by Elihu within the book of Job. &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, days  equals  fulness of days, is equivalent to advanced age, old age with its rich experience. &#1512;&#1489; with its plural genitive is followed (as &#1499;&#1500; sa( d usually is) by the predicate in the plur.; it is the attraction already described by &#1502;&#1505;&#1508;&#1512;, <a href="/job/15-10.htm">Job 15:10</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/21-21.htm">Job 21:21</a>, Ges. 148, 1.</body></html>
