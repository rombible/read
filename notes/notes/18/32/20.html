God is the God of order, not of confusion. It is great refreshment to a good man, to speak for the glory of the Lord, and to edify others. And the more we consider the majesty of God, as our Maker, and the more we dread his wrath and justice, the less shall we sinfully fear or flatter men. Could we set the wrath Lord always before us, in his mercies and his terrors, we should not be moved from doing our duty in whatever we are called to do.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/32.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I will speak, that I may be refreshed - Margin, "breathe."

That his mind might be made easy; the matter it was full of lay with much weight upon it, pressed him hard, and gave him pain; and therefore he determines to speak his mind, and disburden himself: so a minister of the word speaks sometimes to the refreshment of others, the Gospel being a word in season to weary souls, bread to the hungry, drink to the thirsty, even wine to them that are of an heavy heart; and especially it is refreshing when the love of God is shed abroad in the heart through it, and the presence of God is enjoyed under it; and sometimes he speaks to the refreshment of himself with others, <a href="/romans/15-32.htm">Romans 15:32</a>; and whether it be so, one or the other, yet a faithful minister eases his mind, discharges his conscience, and is clear from the blood of all, when he truly and fully declares the whole counsel of God, so far as he is acquainted with it: <p>I will open my lips and answer; speak freely and boldly what was upon his mind, and he had to say, and which he judged would be a sufficient answer to Job; the opening of his lips is a phrase used by him in allusion to the opening of a bottle, full of new wine, the metaphor before expressed by him. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/32.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and answer.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/job/32.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">20</span>. <span class="ital">be refreshed</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">find relief</span>; lit. <span class="ital">get air</span> or <span class="ital">vent</span>.

Elihu feels almost suffocated by conflicting feelings of rage (vers. 1-3), disappointment (vers. 11, 12), and anxiety to vindicate God's honour (ver. 2). <span class="cmt_word">I will open my lips and answer</span>. In the remainder of Elihu's discourse the attempt is made to "answer" Job (see ch. 33-37), with what success will be considered elsewhere. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/32.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>11  Behold, I waited upon your words,<p>Hearkened to your perceptions,<p>While ye searched out replies.<p>12  And I attended closely to you,<p>Yet behold: there was no one who refuted Job,<p>Who answered his sentences, from you.<p>13  Lest ye should say: "We found wisdom,<p>God is able to smite him, not man!"<p>14  Now he hath not arranged his words against me,<p>And with your sentences I will not reply to him.<p>He has waited for their words, viz., that they might give utterance to such words as should tend to refute and silence Job. In what follows, &#1506;&#1491; still more emphatically than &#1500; refers this aim to that to which Elihu had paid great attention: I hearkened to your understandings, i.e., explanations of the matter, that, or whether, they came forth, (I hearkened) to see if you searched or found out words, i.e., appropriate words. Such abbreviated forms as &#1488;&#1494;&#1497;&#1503;  equals  &#1488;&#1488;&#1494;&#1497;&#1503; (comp. &#1502;&#1494;&#1497;&#1503;  equals  &#1502;&#1497;&#1494;&#1497;&#1503; for &#1502;&#1506;&#1494;&#1497;&#1503;, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/17-4.htm">Proverbs 17:4</a>, Ges. 68, rem. 1, if it does not signify nutriens, from &#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;) we shall frequently meet with in this Elihu section. In <a href="//biblehub.com/job/32-12.htm">Job 32:12</a>, <a href="/job/32-12.htm">Job 32:12</a> evidently is related as an antecedent to what follows: and I paid attention to you (&#1506;&#1491;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501; contrary to the analogy of the cognate praep. instead of &#1506;&#1491;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501;, moreover for &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501;, with the accompanying notion: intently, or, according to Aben-Duran: thoroughly, without allowing a word to escape me), and behold, intently as I paid attention: no one came forward to refute Job; there was no one from or among you who answered (met successfully) his assertions. Every unbiassed reader will have an impression of the remarkable expressions and constructions here, similar to that which one has in passing from the book of the Kings to the characteristic sections of the Chronicles. The three, Elihu goes on to say, shall not indeed think that in Job a wisdom has opposed them - a false wisdom, indeed - which only God and not any man can drive out of the field (&#1504;&#1491;&#1507;, Arab. ndf, discutere, dispellere, as the wind drives away chaff or dry leaves); while he has not, however (&#1493;&#1500;&#1488; followed directly by a v. fin. forming a subordinate clause, as <a href="/job/42-3.htm">Job 42:3</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/44-18.htm">Psalm 44:18</a>, and freq., Ew. 341, a), arrayed (&#1506;&#1512;&#1498; in a military sense, <a href="/job/33-5.htm">Job 33:5</a>; or forensic, <a href="/job/23-4.htm">Job 23:4</a>; or even as <a href="//biblehub.com/job/37-19.htm">Job 37:19</a>, in the general sense of proponere) words against him (Elihu), i.e., utterances before which he would be compelled to confess himself affected and overcome. He will not then also answer him with such opinions as those so frequently repeated by them, i.e., he will take a totally different course from theirs in order to refute him. </body></html>
