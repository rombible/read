He allowed that those who had the longest experience should speak first. But God gives wisdom as he pleases; this encouraged him to state his opinion. By attention to the word of God, and dependence upon the Holy Spirit, young men may become wiser than the aged; but this wisdom will render them swift to hear, slow to speak, and disposed to give others a patient hearing.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/32.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Now, he hath not directed his words against me - Margin, "ordered." The meaning of this expression is, "I can approach this subject in a wholly dispassionate and unprejudiced manner. I have had none of the provocations which you have felt; his harsh and severe remarks have not fallen on me as they have on you, and I can come to the subject with the utmost coolness." The object is to show that he was not irritated, and that he would be under no temptation to use words from the influence of passion or any other than those which conveyed the simple truth. He seems disposed to admit that Job had given some occasion for severe remarks, by the manner in which be had treated his friends.<p>Neither will I answer him with your speeches - They also had been wrong. They had given way to passion, and had indulged in severity of language, rather than pursued a simple and calm course of argument. From all this, Eliha says he was free, and could approach the subject in the most calm and dispassionate manner. He had had no temptation to indulge in severity of language like theirs, and he would not do it. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/32.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14.

That is, Job had not directed his speech to him, or levelled his arguments against him; he had not set himself and his words in battle array against him, as the word signifies; he had not lashed and irritated him as he had them; and therefore he came into the dispute calm and unprovoked, having nothing in view but truth, the glory of God, and the good of Job; and therefore hoped for better success than they had had: <p>neither will I answer him with your speeches; he proposed to take a new and different method from them, as he did; for he never charges Job with any sin or sins, or a course of living in a sinful manner, before those afflictions came upon him, and as the cause of them; he only takes notice of what was amiss in him since his afflictions, and what dropped from him in the heat of this controversy, rash and unbecoming speeches, which reflected upon the honour and justice of God; and if he made use of any words and arguments similar to theirs, yet to another purpose, and in a milder and gentler manner. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/32.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Now <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> he hath not directed <i>his</i> words against me: neither will I answer <span class="cverse3">{k}</span> him with your speeches.</span><p>(i) That is, Job.<p>(k) He uses almost the same arguments but without taunting and reproaches.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now he hath not directed his words against me</span>. Elihu thinks that he can interfere in the controversy with the better prospect of a good result, since he is untouched by any of Job's words, and can therefore speak without passion or resentment. <span class="cmt_word">Neither will I answer him with your speeches</span>. He is also going to bring forward fresh arguments, which, as they avoid the line taken by the three friends, may soothe, instead of exasperating, the patriarch. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/32.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>  8  Still the spirit, it is in mortal man,<p>And the breath of the Almighty, that giveth them understanding.<p>  9  Not the great in years are wise,<p>And the aged do not understand what is right.<p>10  Therefore I:say: O hearken to me,<p>I will declare my knowledge, even I.<p>The originally affirmative and then (like &#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1501;) adversative &#1488;&#1499;&#1503; also does not occur elsewhere in the book of Job. In contradiction to biblical psychology, Rosenm. and others take <a href="/job/32-8.htm">Job 32:8</a> as antithetical: Certainly there is spirit in man, but ... . The two halves of the verse are, on the contrary, a synonymous ("the spirit, it is in man, viz., that is and acts") or progressive parallelism) thus according to the accents: "the spirit, even that which is in man, and ... "). It is the Spirit of God to which man owes his life as a living being, according to <a href="/job/33-4.htm">Job 33:4</a>; the spirit of man is the principle of life creatively wrought, and indeed breathed into him, by the Spirit of God; so that with regard to the author it can be just as much God's &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; or &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1492;, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/34-14.htm">Job 34:14</a>, as in respect of the possessor: man's &#1512;&#1493;&#1495; or &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1492;. All man's life, his thinking as well as his bodily life, is effected by this inwrought principle of life which he bears within him, and all true understanding, without being confined to any special age of life, comes solely from this divinely originated and divinely living spirit, so far as he acts according to his divine origin and basis of life. &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; are here (as the opposite of &#1510;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23</a>) grandes  equals  grandaevi (lxx &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;). &#1500;&#1488; governs both members of the verse, as <a href="/job/3-10.htm">Job 3:10</a>; <a href="/job/28-17.htm">Job 28:17</a>; <a href="/job/30-24.htm">Job 30:24</a>. Understanding or ability to form a judgment is not limited to old age, but only by our allowing the &#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; to rule in us in its connection with the divine. Elihu begs a favourable hearing for that of which he is conscious. &#1491;&#1468;&#1506;, and the Hebr.-Aramaic &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492;, which likewise belong to his favourite words, recur here. </body></html>
