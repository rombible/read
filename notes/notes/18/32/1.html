The name appears to mean, <span class= "ital">He is my God. </span>The person from whom he was descended seems to have been the son of Nahor, Abraham’s brother (<a href="/genesis/22-21.htm" title="Huz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram,">Genesis 22:21</a>); and a city of the like name is mentioned in <a href="/jeremiah/25-23.htm" title="Dedan, and Tema, and Buz, and all that are in the utmost corners,">Jeremiah 25:23</a>. There is a Ram mentioned in <a href="/ruth/4-19.htm" title="And Hezron begat Ram, and Ram begat Amminadab,">Ruth 4:19</a>, who was the great grandson of Judah; but we can hardly suppose this was the Ram of whose kindred Elihu was. On the other hand, we have no clue to the identification; for even if, with some, we suppose him to have been the same as Aram, the son of Kemuel, and great nephew of Abraham, it is not easy to see how a descendant of Buz, his uncle, should have been described as of the kindred of Ram. One tradition identifies Ram with Abraham, but this is mere conjecture, and in this case highly improbable; the only inference we can draw is that this specification of Elihu serves to show that he was a real, and not an imaginary, personage. The Targum speaks of Elihu as a relative of Abraham. If we are right in putting the life of Elihu so far back, the whole position and surroundings of Job’s history become the more probable, because what is told us of Abraham and the patriarchs corresponds with the description and character of Job; and then, also, the traditional Mosaic origin of the Book of Job becomes the more probable.<p><span class= "bld">Because he was righteous in his own eyes.</span>—This appears from <a href="/job/3-26.htm" title="I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came.">Job 3:26</a>; <a href="/job/6-10.htm" title="Then should I yet have comfort; yes, I would harden myself in sorrow: let him not spare; for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One.">Job 6:10</a>; <a href="/job/6-29.htm" title="Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yes, return again, my righteousness is in it.">Job 6:29</a>; <a href="/job/10-7.htm" title="You know that I am not wicked; and there is none that can deliver out of your hand.">Job 10:7</a>; <a href="/job/13-15.htm" title="Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him: but I will maintain my own ways before him.">Job 13:15</a>; <a href="/job/19-6.htm" title="Know now that God has overthrown me, and has compassed me with his net.">Job 19:6</a>, &c., <a href="/job/23-7.htm" title="There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be delivered for ever from my judge.">Job 23:7</a>; <a href="/context/job/23-10.htm" title="But he knows the way that I take: when he has tried me, I shall come forth as gold.">Job 23:10-12</a>; <a href="/job/27-6.htm" title="My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: my heart shall not reproach me so long as I live.">Job 27:6</a>; <a href="/job/29-12.htm" title="Because I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless, and him that had none to help him.">Job 29:12</a>, &c.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/job/32.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/job/32-1.htm" title="So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.">Job 32:1</a></span>. <span class="ital">So these three men ceased to answer Job — </span>Finding that he persevered in asserting that he was not guilty of any of the heinous crimes which they laid to his charge, they left off disputing with him; <span class="ital">because he was righteous in his own eyes — </span>So they said; but the fact was they could not answer him.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/job/32.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>32:1-5 Job's friends were silenced, but not convinced.

Elihu was displeased with Job's friends because they had not been candid to Job. Seldom is a quarrel begun, more seldom is a quarrel carried on, in which there are not faults on both sides.

Now all were silent; and though they do not appear in the least to have been convinced, or to have changed their opinion, yet they found no arguments with which to sustain their views. It was this, among other things, which induced Elihu to take up the subject.<p>Because he was righteous in his own eyes - Umbreit expresses the sense of this by adding, "and they could not convince him of his unrighteousness." It was not merely because he was righteous in his own estimation, that they ceased to answer him; it was because their arguments had no effect in convincing him, and they had nothing new to say. He seemed to be obstinately bent on maintaining his own good opinion of himself in spite of all their reasoning, and they sat down in silence. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/32.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 32<p>Job 32:1-37:24.

His three friends, Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite, who came to visit and comfort him under his afflictions; but unawares were led into a controversy with him, occasioned by some rash and impatient expressions of his; which controversy had been carried on between them a considerable time, but now dropped; they grew weary of it, and now rested themselves as men do on a sabbath, as the word signifies; they set themselves down, and made no reply to Job's vindication of himself, not caring to give themselves any further trouble, or labour the point any more and longer, perceiving it was all to no purpose: or "and these three men ceased", &amp;c. the last words of the preceding chapter are, "the words of Job are ended", <a href="/job/31-40.htm">Job 31:40</a>; and the copulative "and" connects these with them, and shows that these men also had done speaking; so that the dispute was closed between Job and them, and the way was clear for another disputant that might think fit to enter, as Elihu did, after mentioned <p>because he was righteous in his own eyes; some take this to express the state of the question between them, rendering the words, "that he was righteous", &amp;c. (f). The notion his friends had of him was, that he was righteous in his own account, and as he professed to be, and might so seem to others; but was a wicked man, and an hypocrite, as his afflictions showed; this point they had been labouring to prove, but, upon Job's long and clear vindication of his integrity, they ceased to defend it: others suppose the words to be an inference of Job's from their silence: "therefore he was righteous", &amp;c. they making no reply to him, he concluded himself to be quit and clear of the charge they had brought against him; but they rather, according to our version, contain a reason why they ceased to answer him; because they thought him self-conceited, self-willed, obstinate, and incorrigible; not open to conviction, stiffly insisting on his own innocence, not allowing that he was guilty of any sin or sins, which were the cause of his afflictions; otherwise, in the article of justification before God, Job was no self-righteous man, nor was he so charged by his friends; to say he was is to abuse his character, and is contrary to that which God himself has given of him; nor would he have so highly commended him as to suggest there was none like him on earth, when of all men in the world there are none more abominable to God than a self-righteous man; see <a href="/isaiah/65-4.htm">Isaiah 65:4</a>. It is contrary to Job's knowledge of and faith in Christ, as his living Redeemer, <a href="/job/19-25.htm">Job 19:25</a>; and to many clear and strong expressions, confessing his sin, disclaiming perfection, and declaring himself no self-justiciary, <a href="/job/7-20.htm">Job 7:20</a>. <p>(f)   "quod ille (tantum) justus in oculis suis", Schmidt. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/32.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/job/32.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">1</span>. <span class="ital">he was righteous</span>] i. e. would admit no guilt, or, was in the right in his plea against God. Job’s friends abandoned further argument with him because they could not move him from his assertion that God afflicted him wrongly and unjustly; comp. ch. <a href="/context/job/27-2.htm" title="As God lives, who has taken away my judgment; and the Almighty, who has vexed my soul;...">Job 27:2-6</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-5.</span> - The discourse of Elihu is prefaced by a short introduction in plain prose, explaining who he was, and giving the reasons which actuated him in coming forward at this point of the dialogue. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So these three men ceased to answer</span> <span class="cmt_word">Job</span>. Zophar had been silenced earlier. Eliphaz and Bildad now felt that they had no more to say. They had exhausted the weapons of their armoury without any effect, and were conscious that nothing would be gained by mere reiteration. All their efforts had aimed at convincing Job of sin; and he was still unconvinced - he remained righteous in his own eyes. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/31.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>35  O that I had one who would hear me!<p>Behold my signature-the Almighty will answer me - <p>And the writing which my opponent hath written!<p>36  Truly I will carry it upon my shoulder,<p>I will wind it about me as a crown.<p>37  The number of my steps I will recount to Him,<p>As a prince will I draw near to Him.<p>The wish that he might find a ready willing hearer is put forth in a general way, but, as is clear in itself, and as it becomes manifest from what follows, refers to Him who, because it treats of a contradiction between the outward appearance and the true but veiled fact, as searcher of the heart, is the only competent judge. It may not be translated: et libellum (the indictment, or even: the reply to Job's self-defence) scribat meus adversarius (Dachselt, Rosenm., Welte) - the accentuation seems to proceed from this rendering, but it ought to be &#1493;&#1499;&#1514;&#1489; &#1505;&#1508;&#1512;; if &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1489; governed by &#1497;&#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497; were intended to be equivalent to &#1497;&#1499;&#1514;&#1468;&#1489;, and referred to God, the longing would be, as it runs, an unworthy and foolish one - nor: (O that I had one who would hear me ... ) and had the indictment, which my adversary has written (Ew., Hirz., Schlottm.) - for &#1493;&#1505;&#1508;&#1512; is too much separated from &#1502;&#1497; &#1497;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503; by what intervenes - in addition to which comes the consideration that the wish, as it is expressed, cannot be referred to God, but only to the human opponent, whose accusations Job has no occasion to wish to hear, since he has already heard amply sufficient even in detail. Therefore &#1492;&#1503; (instead of &#1492;&#1503; with a conjunctive accent, as otherwise with Makkeph) will point not merely to &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;, but also to liber quem scripsit adversarius meus as now lying before them, and the parenthetical &#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497; &#1497;&#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497; will express a desire for the divine decision in the cause now formally prepared for trial, ripe for discussion. By &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;, my sign, i.e., my signature (comp. <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/9-4.htm">Ezekiel 9:4</a>, and Arab. tiwa, a branded sign in the form of a cross), Job intends the last word to his defence which he has just spoken, <a href="/job/31-1.htm">Job 31:1</a>; it is related to all his former confessions as a confirmatory mark set below them; it is his ultimatum, as it were, the letter and seal to all that he has hitherto said about his innocence in opposition to the friends and God. Moreover, he also has the indictment of the triumvirate which has come forward as his opponent in his hands. Their so frequently repeated verbal accusations are fixed as if written; both - their accusation and his defence - lie before him, as it were, in the documentary form of legal writings. Thus, then, he wishes an observant impartial hearer for this his defence; or more exactly: he wishes that the Almighty may answer, i.e., decide. Hahn interprets just as much according to the syntax, but understanding by &#1514;&#1493;&#1497; the witness which Job carries in his breast, and by &#1505;&#1508;&#1512; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; the testimony to his innocence written by God in his own consciousness; which is inadmissible, because, as we have often remarked already, &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1512;&#1497;&#1489;&#1497; (comp. <a href="/job/16-21.htm">Job 16:21</a>) cannot be God himself.<p>In <a href="/job/31-36.htm">Job 31:36</a> Job now says how he will appear before Him with this indictment of his opponent, if God will only condescend to speak the decisive word. He will wear it upon his shoulder as a mark of his dignity (comp. <a href="/isaiah/22-22.htm">Isaiah 22:22</a>; <a href="/isaiah/9-5.htm">Isaiah 9:5</a>), and wind it about him as a magnificent crown of diadems intertwined and heaped up one above another (<a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/19-12.htm">Revelation 19:12</a>, comp. Khler on <a href="/zechariah/6-11.htm">Zechariah 6:11</a>) - confident of his victory at the outset; for he will give Him, the heart-searcher, an account of all his steps, and in the exalted consciousness of his innocence, he will approach Him as a prince (&#1511;&#1512;&#1489; intensive of Kal). How totally different from Adam, who was obliged to be drawn out of his hiding-place, and tremblingly, because conscious of guilt, underwent the examination of the omniscient God! Job is not conscious of cowardly and slyly hidden sins; no secret accursed thing is cherished in the inmost recesses of his heart and home. </body></html>
