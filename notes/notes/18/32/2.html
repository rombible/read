Attentive, all the while, to the debate between Job and his friends, he utters not a word till both sides have done speaking; and then shows, that a stander-by may sometimes see further into a dispute than they who are eagerly engaged therein, and who, by having their passions raised to an undue height, are very apt to carry things to an extreme. <span class="ital">The son of Barachel the Buzite — </span>Of the posterity of Buz, Nahor’s son, <a href="/genesis/22-21.htm" title="Huz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram,">Genesis 22:21</a>; <span class="ital">of the kindred of Ram — </span>Or, <span class="ital">Aram; </span>for the names <span class="ital">Ram </span>and <span class="ital">Aram </span>are used promiscuously in the Hebrew, as the learned reader may see, by comparing <a href="/2_kings/8-28.htm" title="And he went with Joram the son of Ahab to the war against Hazael king of Syria in Ramothgilead; and the Syrians wounded Joram.">2 Kings 8:28</a>, and <a href="/2_chronicles/22-5.htm" title="He walked also after their counsel, and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramothgilead: and the Syrians smote Joram.">2 Chronicles 22:5</a>. The land of Buz was doubtless somewhere in the neighbourhood of Job, as the posterity of Nahor settled in this country. His pedigree is thus particularly described, partly for his honour, as being both a wise and a good man, and principally to evidence the truth of this history. <span class="ital">Because he </span>(Job) <span class="ital">justified himself rather than God — </span>He justified himself not without reflection upon God, as dealing severely with him.

Elihu was not a little provoked at the behaviour of Job for attempting so to vindicate himself as to leave an imputation of injustice on God’s providence. <span class="ital">Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled — </span>For charging Job with such atrocious crimes, and falling so miserably short, when they should have come to the proof, as not to be able to convict him of one of them. <span class="ital">Now Elihu had waited — </span>With patience and expectation, as the word <span class="greekheb">חכה</span>, <span class="ital">chiccha, </span>here used, means; <span class="ital">till Job had spoken — </span>And his three friends; <span class="ital">because they were elder than he — </span>Old age in those days was so highly honoured, that a young man scarcely dared to open his mouth before his elders. Elihu therefore begins with a very modest apology for his engaging in the dispute at all, drawn from his youth. He tells them he had waited a long while to hear what they would offer; but, finding they did not design to reply, he desired their leave to speak his opinion; a liberty, however, which he would not indulge himself in, if they were willing to make an answer, or could any way convict Job of what they had laid to his charge. He intimates that his intention was to attack him in a quite different manner from what they had done, for which reason he should not think himself at all obliged to answer the same arguments he had urged against them. But, at the same time, he declares it was not his intention to speak partially in his favour, since the acceptance of persons was a crime which he was sensible would be severely punished by the Almighty.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/job/32.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>32:1-5 Job's friends were silenced, but not convinced. Others had been present. Elihu was justly displeased with Job, as more anxious to clear his own character than the justice and goodness of God. Elihu was displeased with Job's friends because they had not been candid to Job. Seldom is a quarrel begun, more seldom is a quarrel carried on, in which there are not faults on both sides. Those that seek for truth, must not reject what is true and good on either side, nor approve or defend what is wrong.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/32.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Then was kindled the wrath - Wrath or anger is commonly represented as kindled, or as burning.<p>Of Elihu - The name Elihu (&#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1488;  'e&#774;l&#305;&#770;yhu&#770;') means, "God is he;" or, since the word He (&#1492;&#1493;&#1488;  hu&#770;') is often used by way of eminence to denote the true God or Yahweh, the name is equivalent to saying, "God is my God," or "my God is Yahweh." On what account this name was given to him, is now unknown. The names which were anciently given, however, were commonly significant, and it was not unusual to incorporate the name of God in those given to human beings. See the notes at <a href="/isaiah/1-1.htm">Isaiah 1:1</a>. This name was probably given as an expression of piety on the part of his parents.<p>The son of Barachel - The name Barachel &#1489;&#1512;&#1499;&#1488;&#1500;  ba&#770;rak'e&#770;l means "God blesses," and was also probably given as expressive of the piety of his parents, and as furnishing in the name itself a valuable motto which the child would remember. Nothing more is known of him than the name; and the only propriety of remarking on the philology of the names arises from the fact that they seem to indicate the existence of piety, or of the knowledge of God, on the part of the ancestors of Elihu.<p>The Buzite - Buz was the second son of Nahor, the brother of Abraham, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/22-20.htm">Genesis 22:20-21</a>. A city of the name Buz is mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-23.htm">Jeremiah 25:23</a>, in connection with Dedan and Tema, cities of Arabia, and it is probable that Barachel, the father of Elihu, was of that city. If this name was given to the place after the son of Nahor, it will follow that Elihu, and consequently Job, must have lived after the time of Abraham.<p>Of the kindred of Ram - Of Ram nothing is certainly known. The Chaldee renders this &#1490;&#1504;&#1497;&#1505;&#1514; &#1502;&#1503; &#1488;&#1489;&#1512;&#1495;&#1501;, of the race of Abraham. Some have supposed that the Ram mentioned here is the same as the ancestor of David mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/ruth/4-19.htm">Ruth 4:19</a>, and in the genealogical table in <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/1-3.htm">Matthew 1:3-4</a>, under the name of Aram. Others suppose that he was of the family of Nahor, and that the name is the same as &#1488;&#1512;&#1501;  'a&#774;ra&#770;m mentioned in <a href="/genesis/22-21.htm">Genesis 22:21</a>. Thus, by aphaeresis the Syrians are called &#1512;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;  ramm&#305;&#770;ym, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/22-5.htm">2 Chronicles 22:5</a>, instead of &#1488;&#1512;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;  'a&#774;ramm&#305;&#770;ym, as they are usually denominated; compare <a href="/2_kings/8-29.htm">2 Kings 8:29</a>. But nothing certain is known of him who is mentioned here. It is worthy of observation that the author of the book of Job has given the genealogy of Elihu with much greater particularity than he has that of either Job or his three friends. Indeed, he has not attempted to trace their genealogy at all. Of Job he does not even mention the name of his father; of his three friends he mentions merely the place where they dwelt. Rosenmuller infers, from this circumstance, that Elihu is himself the author of the book, since, says he, it is the custom of the Turks and Persians, in their poems, to weave in, near the end of the poem, the name of the author in an artificial manner. The same view is taken by Lightfoot, Chronica temporum et ord. Text. V. T. A circumstance of this kind, however, is too slight an argument to determine the question of the authorship of the book. It may have been that Elihu was less known than either of the other speakers, and hence, there was a propriety in mentioning more particularly his family. Indeed, this fact is morally certain, for he is not mentioned, as the others are, as the "friend" of Job.<p>Because he justified himself - Margin, his soul. So the Hebrew; the word &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;  nephesh, soul, being often used to denote oneself.<p>Rather than God - Prof. Lee renders this, "justified himself with God;" and so also Umbreit, Good, and some others. And so the Vulgate renders it: - coram Deo. The Septuagint renders it, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;  enantion kuriou - against the Lord; that is, rather than the Lord. The proper translation of the Hebrew (&#1502;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501;  me&#772;'e&#774;lo&#770;h&#305;&#770;ym) is undoubtedly more than God: and this was doubtless the idea which Elihu intended to convey. He understood Job as vindicating himself rather than God; as being more willing that aspersions should be cast on the character and government of God, than to confess his own sin. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/32.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. Elihu&#8212;meaning "God is Jehovah." In his name and character as messenger between God and Job, he foreshadows Jesus Christ (Job 33:23-26).<p>Barachel&#8212;meaning "God blesses." Both names indicate the piety of the family and their separation from idolaters.<p>Buzite&#8212;Buz was son of Nahor, brother of Abraham. Hence was named a region in Arabia-Deserta (Jer 25:23).<p>Ram&#8212;Aram, nephew of Buz. Job was probably of an older generation than Elihu. However, the identity of names does not necessarily prove the identity of persons. The particularity with which Elihu's descent is given, as contrasted with the others, led Lightfoot to infer Elihu was the author of the book. But the reason for particularity was, probably, that Elihu was less known than the three called "friends" of Job; and that it was right for the poet to mark especially him who was mainly to solve the problem of the book.<p>rather than God&#8212;that is, was more eager to vindicate himself than God. In Job 4:17, Job denies that man can be more just than God.

Both against Job and his three friends, for reasons after given; who this person was is not easy to say; they debase him too much, who make him to be Balaam the soothsayer, according to the tradition of the Jews (g); for neither the time he lived in, nor his character, will agree with him; this man living before the times of Balaam; and being also a holy good man, which all his discourses show: and they too much exalt him who make him to be Christ; for though some phrases, being strained, may seem to agree with him, and some things in the signification of his name, and the names of his ancestors, may be thought to answer to him; Elihu signifying, "my God is he"; the son of Barachel, "the son of the blessed God"; of the kindred of Ram, of the high and holy line; the Buzite, one "despised" and reproached; yet there are other things that cannot be said of him, as particularly in <a href="/job/32-22.htm">Job 32:22</a>; besides, the Messiah seems to be spoken of by him as another person, <a href="/job/33-23.htm">Job 33:23</a>; it is very probable that he was one of Job's relations that was come to visit him in his melancholy circumstances, had been a bystander, and an hearer of the whole dispute between Job and his friends, with the management of which he was not a little displeased; he is described by his descent, when Job's other three friends are not, because he was a young man, and not known as they were: and this serves to show the truth of this history, that it is not a mere apologue, or moral fable, but a real fact; though who his father Barachel the Buzite was cannot easily be determined; it is probable he was a descendant of Buz, the son of Nahor, Abraham's brother, <a href="/genesis/22-20.htm">Genesis 22:20</a>; of this opinion are Aben Ezra and Ben Gersom; unless it can be thought he was so called from the city Buz, of which he might be an inhabitant, mentioned along with Dedan and Tema, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-23.htm">Jeremiah 25:23</a>, places in Edom or Idumea, where or near to which <a href="//biblehub.com/job/54.htm">Job 54</a>ed: <p>of the kindred of Ram; according to the Targum, of the kindred of Abraham, in which it is followed by other Jewish writers (h); and some even take him to be Isaac, the son of Abraham (i); Aben Ezra thinks he is the same with Ram the father of Amminadab, <a href="/ruth/4-19.htm">Ruth 4:19</a>; but he is abundantly too late for this man to be of his kindred; others take him to be the same with Aram, the son of Kemuel, a brother of Buz, <a href="/genesis/22-21.htm">Genesis 22:21</a>; these names being used for one another, either by adding or removing a letter; see <a href="/matthew/1-3.htm">Matthew 1:3</a>; compared with <a href="/ruth/4-19.htm">Ruth 4:19</a>; <p>against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God; not that he made himself more just than God, he could never think or say so, see <a href="/job/4-17.htm">Job 4:17</a>; nor that he was just before him or by him; for he was so in an evangelic, though not in a legal sense; and Elihu would not have been displeased with him for asserting that; he did not deny that Job was a righteous man in the sight of God; nor that he was righteous, and in the right in the sight of God, with respect to the controversy between him and his friends; nor did he blame him for justifying himself from their charges; but that he justified himself "more" than God; so the Jewish writers (k) generally render it: he spent more time, and insisted longer on his own justification than upon the justification of God in the dealings of his providence with him; he was more careful of his own character and reputation than he was of the honour of God, and the glory of his justice; he said more for himself than he did for God; and this displeased Elihu; it gave this good man some concern, that, though Job did not directly charge God with unrighteousness in his dealings with him, yet by consequence; and he expressed himself in such language that would bear such a construction, whether it was his real sense or not; and to hear him complain so heavily of God, and at the same time enlarge so much on his own innocence, and to importune in so bold and daring a manner to have a hearing of his cause; these things being observed by Elihu, raised his choler and indignation. <p>(g) T.

Introduction of Elihu, a new speaker, who appears to have been a listener during the progress of the former debate. The descent of Elihu is given with fuller details than in the case of the other speakers. The name Elihu, meaning probably <span class="ital">my God is he</span>, occurs elsewhere, <a href="/1_samuel/1-1.htm" title="Now there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite:">1 Samuel 1:1</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/12-20.htm" title="As he went to Ziklag, there fell to him of Manasseh, Adnah, and Jozabad, and Jediael, and Michael, and Jozabad, and Elihu, and Zilthai, captains of the thousands that were of Manasseh.">1 Chronicles 12:20</a>. He is named the Buzite. Buz was brother of Uz, <a href="/genesis/22-21.htm" title="Huz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram,">Genesis 22:21</a>, and son of Nahor. In <a href="/jeremiah/25-23.htm" title="Dedan, and Tema, and Buz, and all that are in the utmost corners,">Jeremiah 25:23</a> Buz is mentioned along with Tema (cf. <a href="/job/6-19.htm" title="The troops of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for them.">Job 6:19</a>), and reckoned among the Arab tribes. The name Ram, therefore, which does not occur elsewhere, is scarcely to be taken as a contraction for Aram or Syria (though comp. <a href="/2_chronicles/22-5.htm" title="He walked also after their counsel, and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramothgilead: and the Syrians smote Joram.">2 Chronicles 22:5</a>, where Ramites = Aramites).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">justified himself rather than God</span>] The meaning appears to be, justified himself as against God, in his plea with God and at the expense of God’s justice. The sense is given in ch. <a href="/job/40-8.htm" title="Will you also cancel my judgment? will you condemn me, that you may be righteous?">Job 40:8</a>, where the Lord says to Job, “Wilt thou condemn me that thou mayest be righteous”? There are two points to be attended to in these passages when the question of <span class="ital">right</span> is raised, the one a formal point and the other a material one. God had afflicted Job and thus, in Job’s view and the view of his time, passed a verdict of wickedness on him. Against this verdict Job reclaims, God does him wrong in this. This is the formal question of right between Job and God. But this naturally goes back into the material question of Job’s past life. Elihu, defending the righteousness of God, keeps before him chiefly the formal question. He touches little upon Job’s life and history, differing in this entirely from the three friends. He makes a general, abstract question out of Job’s complaints against God, which he argues on general lines with almost no reference to Job’s particular case. Job’s complaints do little more than suggest to him the question, Can God be justly complained of?<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu</span>.

It is found among the ancestors of Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/1-1.htm">1 Samuel 1:1</a>), among the Korhite Levites of the time of David (<a href="/1_chronicles/26-7.htm">1 Chronicles 26:7</a>), and as a variant for Eliab, one of David's brothers (<a href="/1_chronicles/27-8.htm">1 Chronicles 27:8</a>) The meaning of the word was, "He is my God" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5dc;&#x5d9;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5d0;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">The son of Barachal</span>. Barachel is also a significant name. It means, "Bless, O God," or "God blesses" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5dc;</span>). Both names imply that the new interlocutor belonged to a family of monotheists. <span class="cmt_word">The Buzite</span>. "Huz" and "Buz" were brothers, the sons of Nahor, Abraham's brother, by Maleah, the daughter of Haran (<a href="/genesis/11-29.htm">Genesis 11:29</a>; <a href="/genesis/22-20.htm">Genesis 22:20, 21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Of the kindred of Ram.</span> By "Ram" we are probably to understand "Aram," who was the son of Kemuel, a brother of Huz and Buz. (On the connection of Huz and Buz with the Arabian tribes of Khazu and Bazu, see the comment on Job 1:1.) <span class="cmt_word">Against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God</span>. Elihu was well-intentional; and it is perhaps not surprising that he had been shocked by some of Job's expressions. Job had himself apologized for them (<a href="/job/6-26.htm">Job 6:26</a>); and certainly they went perilously near taxing God with injustice (see <a href="/job/40-8.htm">Job 40:8</a>). But it is to be remembered that finally God justifies Job's sayings, while condemning those of his "comforters." "My wrath is kindled," he says to Eliphaz, "against thee, and against thy two friends: for ye have not spoken of me <span class="accented">the thing that is right</span> <span class="accented">as my servant Job</span> hath" (<a href="/job/42-7.htm">Job 42:7</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/31.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>35  O that I had one who would hear me!<p>Behold my signature-the Almighty will answer me - <p>And the writing which my opponent hath written!<p>36  Truly I will carry it upon my shoulder,<p>I will wind it about me as a crown.<p>37  The number of my steps I will recount to Him,<p>As a prince will I draw near to Him.<p>The wish that he might find a ready willing hearer is put forth in a general way, but, as is clear in itself, and as it becomes manifest from what follows, refers to Him who, because it treats of a contradiction between the outward appearance and the true but veiled fact, as searcher of the heart, is the only competent judge. It may not be translated: et libellum (the indictment, or even: the reply to Job's self-defence) scribat meus adversarius (Dachselt, Rosenm., Welte) - the accentuation seems to proceed from this rendering, but it ought to be &#1493;&#1499;&#1514;&#1489; &#1505;&#1508;&#1512;; if &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1489; governed by &#1497;&#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497; were intended to be equivalent to &#1497;&#1499;&#1514;&#1468;&#1489;, and referred to God, the longing would be, as it runs, an unworthy and foolish one - nor: (O that I had one who would hear me ... ) and had the indictment, which my adversary has written (Ew., Hirz., Schlottm.) - for &#1493;&#1505;&#1508;&#1512; is too much separated from &#1502;&#1497; &#1497;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503; by what intervenes - in addition to which comes the consideration that the wish, as it is expressed, cannot be referred to God, but only to the human opponent, whose accusations Job has no occasion to wish to hear, since he has already heard amply sufficient even in detail. Therefore &#1492;&#1503; (instead of &#1492;&#1503; with a conjunctive accent, as otherwise with Makkeph) will point not merely to &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;, but also to liber quem scripsit adversarius meus as now lying before them, and the parenthetical &#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497; &#1497;&#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497; will express a desire for the divine decision in the cause now formally prepared for trial, ripe for discussion. By &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;, my sign, i.e., my signature (comp. <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/9-4.htm">Ezekiel 9:4</a>, and Arab. tiwa, a branded sign in the form of a cross), Job intends the last word to his defence which he has just spoken, <a href="/job/31-1.htm">Job 31:1</a>; it is related to all his former confessions as a confirmatory mark set below them; it is his ultimatum, as it were, the letter and seal to all that he has hitherto said about his innocence in opposition to the friends and God. Moreover, he also has the indictment of the triumvirate which has come forward as his opponent in his hands. Their so frequently repeated verbal accusations are fixed as if written; both - their accusation and his defence - lie before him, as it were, in the documentary form of legal writings. Thus, then, he wishes an observant impartial hearer for this his defence; or more exactly: he wishes that the Almighty may answer, i.e., decide. Hahn interprets just as much according to the syntax, but understanding by &#1514;&#1493;&#1497; the witness which Job carries in his breast, and by &#1505;&#1508;&#1512; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; the testimony to his innocence written by God in his own consciousness; which is inadmissible, because, as we have often remarked already, &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1512;&#1497;&#1489;&#1497; (comp. <a href="/job/16-21.htm">Job 16:21</a>) cannot be God himself.<p>In <a href="/job/31-36.htm">Job 31:36</a> Job now says how he will appear before Him with this indictment of his opponent, if God will only condescend to speak the decisive word. He will wear it upon his shoulder as a mark of his dignity (comp. <a href="/isaiah/22-22.htm">Isaiah 22:22</a>; <a href="/isaiah/9-5.htm">Isaiah 9:5</a>), and wind it about him as a magnificent crown of diadems intertwined and heaped up one above another (<a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/19-12.htm">Revelation 19:12</a>, comp. Khler on <a href="/zechariah/6-11.htm">Zechariah 6:11</a>) - confident of his victory at the outset; for he will give Him, the heart-searcher, an account of all his steps, and in the exalted consciousness of his innocence, he will approach Him as a prince (&#1511;&#1512;&#1489; intensive of Kal). How totally different from Adam, who was obliged to be drawn out of his hiding-place, and tremblingly, because conscious of guilt, underwent the examination of the omniscient God! Job is not conscious of cowardly and slyly hidden sins; no secret accursed thing is cherished in the inmost recesses of his heart and home. </body></html>
