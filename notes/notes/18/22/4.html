What Eliphaz says, is unjustly applied to Job, but it is very true, that when God does us good it is not because he is indebted to us. Man's piety is no profit to God, no gain. The gains of religion to men are infinitely greater than the losses of it. God is a Sovereign, who gives no account of his conduct; but he is perfectly wise, just, faithful, good, and merciful. He approves the likeness of his own holiness, and delights in the fruits of his Spirit; he accepts the thankful services of the humble believer, while he rejects the proud claim of the self-confident.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Will he reprove thee for fear of thee? - Or, rather, will he come into trial, and argue his cause before a tribunal, because he is afraid that his character will suffer, or because he feels himself bound to appear, and answer to the charges which may be brought? The language is all taken from courts of justice, and the object is, to reprove Job as if he felt that it was necessary that God should appear and answer to what he alleged against him.<p>Will he enter with thee into judgment? - Will he condescend to enter on a trial with one like thee? Will he submit his cause to a trial with man, as if he were an equal, or as if man had any right to such an investigation? It is to be remembered, that Job had repeatedly expressed a desire to carry his cause before God, and that God would meet him as an equal, and not take advantage of his majesty and power to overwhelm him; see <a href="//biblehub.com/job/13-3.htm">Job 13:3</a>, note; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/13-20.htm">Job 13:20-21</a>, notes. Eliphaz here asks, whether God could be expected to meet "a man," one of his own creatures, in this manner, and to go into a trial of the cause. He says that God was supreme; that no one could bring him into court; and that he could not be restrained from doing his pleasure by any dread of man. These sentiments are all noble and correct, and worthy of a sage. Soon, however, he changes the style, and utters the language of severe reproach, because Job had presumed to make such a suggestion. Perhaps, also, in this verse, a special emphasis should be placed on "thee." "Will God enter into trial with thee ... a man whose wickedness is so great, and whose sin is infinite?" <a href="//biblehub.com/job/22-4.htm">Job 22:4-5</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4.

That is, chastise, correct, and afflict, for fear that hurt should be done unto him; no, he will not; for as the goodness of men does not profit him, the sinfulness of men does not hurt him, see <a href="/job/35-6.htm">Job 35:6</a>. Kings and civil magistrates sometimes chastise offenders, not only to do justice to them, but through fear of them, lest, if spared or connived at, they should be hurtful to the state, and overturn it; but though sin is an act of hostility against God, and strikes at his being and government, yet he is in no fear of being ruined or dethroned, or of having his government taken out of his hands, and therefore does not chastise men on that account: or "for thy fear" (m), for thy fear of God, thy piety; or "for thy religion", as Mr. Broughton translates the word. Job had often suggested that good men, such that truly feared God, are afflicted by him, and therefore his own afflictions were no objection to his character, as a man that feared God, and eschewed evil, <a href="/job/1-1.htm">Job 1:1</a>; and in this sense Eliphaz uses the word, <a href="/job/4-6.htm">Job 4:6</a>; and here he intimates, as if, according to the notion of Job, that God afflicted him, and other good men, because they feared him, and which he observes, as a great absurdity; whereas, on the contrary, he chastised him for his sins, as <a href="/job/22-5.htm">Job 22:5</a> shows; but though God does not afflict men for their goodness, but for sins, yet they are only such that fear him, and whom he loves, that he chastises in a fatherly way, see <a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6</a>; <p>will he enter with thee into judgment? that is, will he, in reverence to thee, out of respect to so great a person (speaking ironically), in condescension to one of so much consequence, will he regard thy request, so often made, as to come into judgment with thee, and to admit of thy cause being pleaded before him, and to give the hearing of it, and decide the affair in controversy? or rather, will he not plead against thee, and condemn thee for thy sins, as follow? in this sense it is to be deprecated, and not desired, see <a href="/psalms/143-2.htm">Psalm 143:2</a>. <p>(m) "an de religione tua", Junius &amp; Tremellius; "ob timorem tuum", so some in Drusius; "num ob pietatem tuam", others in Michaelis. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/22.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Will he reprove thee for fear <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> of thee? will he enter with thee into judgment?</span><p>(b) Lest you should reprove or hurt him?</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/job/22.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">4</span>.

The words scarcely contain the idea that if God derived advantage from men’s piety He might be supposed to afflict them in order to increase their godliness (Ew.). The simple thought is that man’s conduct does not affect God. If God deals with man it is on account of man himself. Can it be supposed then that God would afflict a man because he is pious? (<span class="ital"><a href="/job/22-4.htm" title="Will he reprove you for fear of you? will he enter with you into judgment?">Job 22:4</a></span>).

It is certainly the most natural to refer &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1491;, like &#1497;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500;, to the deceased. The explanation: and over the tomb one keeps watch (Bttch., Hahn, Rd., Olsh.), is indeed in itself admissible, since that which serves as the efficient subject is often left unexpressed (<a href="/genesis/48-2.htm">Genesis 48:2</a>; <a href="/2_kings/9-21.htm">2 Kings 9:21</a>; <a href="/isaiah/53-9.htm">Isaiah 53:9</a>; comp. supra, on <a href="/job/18-18.htm">Job 18:18</a>); but that, according to the prevalent usage of the language, &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1491; would denote only a guard of honour at night, not also in the day, and that for clearness it would have required &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493; instead of &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, are considerations which do not favour this explanation, for &#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1491; signifies to watch, to be active, instead of sleeping or resting; and moreover, the placing of guards of honour by graves is an assumed, but not proved, custom of antiquity. Nevertheless, &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1491; might also in general denote the watchful, careful tending of the grave, and the maqa&#770;m (the tomb) of one who is highly honoured has, according to Moslem custom, servants (cha&#770;dim&#305;&#770;n) who are appointed for this duty. But though the translation "one watches" should not be objected to on this ground, the preference is to be given to a commendable rendering which makes the deceased the subject of &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1491;. Raschi's explanation does not, however, commend itself: "buried in his own land, he also in death still keeps watch over the heaps of sheaves." The lxx translates similarly, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;, which Jerome improperly, but according to a right sentiment, translates, in congerie mortuorum. For after the preceding mention of the pomp of burial, &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, which certainly signifies a heap of sheaves in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/5-26.htm">Job 5:26</a>, is favoured by the assumption of its signifying a sepulchral heap, with reference to which also in that passage (where interment is likewise the subject of discourse) the expression is chosen. Haji Gaon observes that the dome (&#1511;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492;, Arab. qbbt, the dome and the sepulchral monument vaulted over by it)<p>(Note: Vid., Lane's Manners and Customs of the Modern Egyptians (translated by Zenker).)<p>erected over graves according to Arab custom is intended; and Aben-Ezra says, that not exactly this, but in general the grave-mound formed of earth, etc., is to be understood. In reality, &#1490;&#1491;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; (from the verb &#1490;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;, cumulare, commonly used in the Talmud and Aramaic) signifies cumulus, in the most diversified connections, which in Arabic are distributed among the verbs jds, kds, and jds&#780;, especially tumulus, Arab. jadatun (broader pronunciation jadafun). If by grave-mound a mound with the grave upon it can be understood, a beautiful explanation is presented which accords with the preference of the Beduin for being buried on an eminence, in order that even in death he may be surrounded by his relations, and as it were be able still to overlook their encampment: the one who should have had a better lot is buried in the best place of the plain, in an insignificant grave; the rich man, however, is brought up to an eminence and keeps watch on his elevated tomb, since from this eminence as from a watch-tower he even in death, as it were, enjoys the wide prospect which delighted him so while living.<p>(Note: "Take my bones," says an Arabian poem, "and carry them with you, wherever you go; and if ye bury them, bury them opposite your encampment! And bury me not under a vine, which would shade me, but upon a hill, so that my eye can see you!" Vid., Ausland, 1863, Nr. 15 (Ein Ritt nach Transjordanien).)<p>But the signification collis cannot be supported; &#1490;&#1491;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; signifies the hill which is formed by the grave itself, and <a href="/job/21-33.htm">Job 21:33</a> indeed directs us to the wady as the place of burial, not to the hill. But if &#1490;&#1491;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; is the grave-mound, it is also not possible with Schlottm. to think of the pictures on the wall and images of the deceased, as they are found in the Egyptian vaults (although in <a href="/job/3-14.htm">Job 3:14</a> we recognised an allusion to the pyramids), for it cannot then be a &#1490;&#1491;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; in the strict sense that is spoken of; the word ought, like the Arabic jdt&#817; (which the Arab. translation of the New Testament in the London Polyglott uses of the &#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; of Jesus), with a mingling of its original signification, to have been used in the general signification sepulcrum. This would be possible, but it need not be supposed. Job's words are the pictorial antithesis to Bildad's assertion, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/18-17.htm">Job 18:17</a>, that the godless man dies away without trace or memorial; it is not so, but as may be heard from the mouth of people who have experience in the world: he keeps watch over his tomb, he continues to watch although asleep, since he is continually brought to remembrance by the monument built over his tomb. A keeping watch that no one approaches the tomb disrespectfully (Ew.), is not to be thought of. &#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1491; is a relative negation of the sleep of death: he is dead, but in a certain manner he continues to live, viz., in the monument planting forward his memory, which it remains for the imagination to conceive of as a mausoleum, or weapons, or other votive offerings hung upon the walls, etc. In connection with such honour, which follows him even to and beyond death, the clods of the valley (est ei terra levis) are sweet (&#1502;&#1514;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468; is accentuated with Mercha, and &#1500;&#1493; without Makkeph with little-Rebia) to him; and if death in itself ought to be accounted an evil, he has shared the common fate which all men after him will meet, and which all before him have met; it is the common end of all made sweet to him by the pageantry of his burial and his after-fame. Most modern expositors (Ew., Hirz., Umbr., Hlgst., Welte) understand the &#1497;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498;, which is used, certainly, not in the transitive signification: to draw after one's self, but in the intransitive: to draw towards (lxx &#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;), as <a href="/judges/4-6.htm">Judges 4:6</a> (vid., Ges. Thes.), of an imitative treading of the same way; but &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1491;&#1501; would then be an untrue hyperbole, by which Job would expose himself to the attack of his adversaries.<p>In <a href="/job/21-34.htm">Job 21:34</a> Job concludes his speech; the Waw of &#1493;&#1488;&#1497;&#1498;, according to the idea (as e.g., the Waw in &#1493;&#1488;&#1504;&#1497;, <a href="/isaiah/43-12.htm">Isaiah 43:12</a>), is an inferential ergo.
