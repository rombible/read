He walks above that cerulean, so high, that he cannot see what occurs on earth, and to punish mortals. This was not an uncommon sentiment among the ancients, though it is here, with the greatest injustice, attributed to Job. A similar sentiment is expressed by Lucretius, as quoted by Rosenmuller and Noyes:<p>Omnis enim per se Divum natura necesse est<p>Immortali aevo summa cum pace fruatur,<p>Semota a nostris rebus, sejunctaque longe.<p>Nam privata dolore omni, privata periclis,<p>Ipsa suis pollens opibus, nihil in liga nostri,<p>Nec bene promeritus capitur, nec tangitur ira.<p>Compare <a href="/isaiah/29-15.htm">Isaiah 29:15</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. in the circuit of heaven&#8212;only, not taking any part in earthly affairs. Job is alleged as holding this Epicurean sentiment (La 3:44; Isa 29:15; 40:27; Jer 23:24; Eze 8:12; Ps 139:12).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/job/22.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> His conversation and business and delight is in the higher and heavenly world, which is worthy of his care, but he will not disparage nor burden himself with the care of this contemptible spot of earth; which was the opinion of many heathen philosophers, and, as they fancied, was Job’s opinion also. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/job/22.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Thick clouds are a covering to him, that he seeth not,.... Thus Job is made to speak, or to reason as atheistical persons, or such who are inclined to atheism would, who take God to be altogether such an one as themselves; as that because thick clouds hide objects, as the sun, and moon, and stars, from their sight, therefore they must hide men and their actions from the sight of God; whereas there is nothing between God and man to hide them from him, let them be what they will, clouds as thick and as dark as can be imagined, yet his eyes are upon the ways of man, and see all his goings, nor is there any darkness that can hide from him, <a href="/job/34-21.htm">Job 34:21</a>; <p>and he walketh in the circuit of heaven; within which he keeps himself, and never looks down upon the earth, or takes any notice of what is done there; quite contrary to <a href="/psalms/14-3.htm">Psalm 14:3</a>; as if he only took his walks through the spacious orb of heaven, and delighted himself in viewing the celestial mansions, and the furniture of them, but had no regard to anything below them; whereas, though he walks in the circuit of heaven, he also sits upon the circle of the earth, <a href="/isaiah/41-22.htm">Isaiah 41:22</a>; Eliphaz seems here to ascribe the sentiments perhaps of the Zabians in former times to Job, and since adopted by some philosophers; that God only regards the heavenly bodies, and supports them in their beings, and regulates and directs their motions, and leaves all things below to be governed and influenced by them, as judging it unworthy of him to be concerned with things on earth. Indeed the earth and the inhabitants of it are unworthy of his notice and care, and of his providential visits, but he does humble himself to look upon things on earth as well as in heaven, <a href="/psalms/8-4.htm">Psalm 8:4</a>; to make Job reason after this Epicurean manner was doing great injustice to his character, who most firmly believed both the being and providence of God, and that as extending to all things here below, see <a href="/job/12-13.htm">Job 12:13</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/22.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Thick clouds are a covering to him, that he seeth not; and he walketh in the circuit of heaven.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/job/22.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">14</span>. <span class="ital">in the circuit of heaven</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">on the circle</span>, i. e. the arch of heaven that overspans the earth, <a href="/isaiah/40-22.htm" title="It is he that sits on the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers; that stretches out the heavens as a curtain, and spreads them out as a tent to dwell in:">Isaiah 40:22</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thick clouds are a covering to him, that he seeth not</span> (see the comment on the preceding verse); and he walketh in the circuit of heaven; or, on <span class="accented">the circumference of the heavens.</span> The heavens are regarded as a solid vault, <span class="accented">outside</span> which is the place where God dwells. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/22.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The man of the arm, &#1494;&#1512;&#1493;&#1506;, is in Eliphaz' mind Job himself. He has by degrees acquired the territory far and wide for himself, by having brought down the rightful possessors by open violence (<a href="/job/20-19.htm">Job 20:19</a>), or even by cunning and unfeeling practices, and is not deterred by any threat of a curse (<a href="/job/15-28.htm">Job 15:28</a>): &#1500;&#1493; &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, he looked upon it as his, and his it must become; and since with his possessions his authority increased, he planted himself firmly in it, filled it out alone, like a stout fellow who takes the room of all others away. Umbr., Hahn, and others think Job's partiality for power and rank is described in <a href="/job/22-8.htm">Job 22:8</a>; but both assertions read straightforward, without any intimation of co-operation. The address is here only suspended, in order to describe the man as he was and is. The all-absorbing love of self regulated his dealings. In possession of the highest power and highest rank, he was not easy of access. Widows and orphans, that they might not perish, were obliged to turn suppliantly to him. But the widows he chased away with empty hands, and the arms of the orphans were crushed. From the address a turn is also here taken to an objective utterance turned from the person addressed, intended however for him; the construction is like &#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1514; &#1497;&#1506;&#1499;&#1500;, unleavened bread is eaten, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/13-7.htm">Exodus 13:7</a>, according to Ew. 295, b. The arms are not conceived of as stretched out for help (which would rather be &#1497;&#1491;&#1497;), nor as demanding back their perverted right, but the crushing of the arms, as <a href="/psalms/37-17.htm">Psalm 37:17</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-22.htm">Ezekiel 30:22</a>, and frequently implies a total destruction of every power, support, and help, after the analogy of the Arabic phrase compared by Ges. in his Thes. pp. 268b, 433b.
