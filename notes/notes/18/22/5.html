He charges him with oppression, and that he did harm with his wealth and power in the time of his prosperity.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Is not thy wickedness great? - That is, "Is it not utter presumption and folly for a man, whose wickedness is undoubtedly so great, to presume to enter into a litigation with God?" Eliphaz here "assumes" it as an undeniable proposition, that Job was a great sinner. This charge had not been directly made before. He and his friends had argued evidently on that supposition, and had maintained that one who was a great sinner would be punished in this life for it, and they had left it to be implied, in no doubtful manner, that they so regarded Job. But the charge had not been before so openly made. Here Eliphaz argues as if that were a point that could not be disputed. The only "proof" that he had, so far as appears, was, that Job had been afflicted as they maintained great sinners "would be," and they, therefore, concluded that he must be such. No facts are referred to, except that he was a great sufferer, and yet, on the ground of this, he proceeds to take for granted that he "must have been" a man who had taken a pledge for no cause; had refused to give water to the thirsty; had been an oppressor, etc.<p>And thine iniquities infinite? - Hebrew "And there is no end to thine iniquities," that is, they are without number. This does not mean that sin is an "infinite evil," or that his sins were infinite in degree; but that if one should attempt to reckon up the number of his transgressions, there would be no end to them. This, I believe, is the only place in the Bible where sin is spoken of, in any respect, as "infinite;" and this cannot be used as a proof text, to show that sin is an infinite evil, for:<p>(1) that is not the meaning of the passage even with respect to Job;<p>(2) it makes no affirmation respecting sin in general; and<p>(3) it was untrue, even in regard to Job, and in the sense in which Zophar meant to use the phrase.<p>There is no intelligible sense in which it can be said that sin is "an infinite evil;" and no argument should be based on such a declaration, to prove that sin demanded an infinite atonement, or that it deserves eternal sufferings. Those doctrines can be defended on solid grounds - they should not be made to rest on a false assumption, or on a false interpretation of the Scriptures. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5.

It must be owned it is, it cannot be denied. Indeed, the wickedness of every man's heart is great, it being desperately wicked, full of sin, abounding with it; out of it comes forth everything that is bad, and the wickedness of actions is very great: some sins are indeed greater than others, as those against God, and the first table of the law, are greater than those against men, or the second table; some are like crimson and scarlet, are beams in the eye, while others are comparatively as motes; yet all are great, as committed against God, and as they are breaches of his law; and especially they appear so to sensible sinners, to whom sin is made exceeding sinful; and they see and own themselves to be the chief of sinners, and as such entreat for pardon on that account, see <a href="/psalms/25-11.htm">Psalm 25:11</a>; <p>and thine iniquities infinite? strictly speaking, nothing is infinite but God; sins may be said in some sense to be infinite, because committed against an infinite God, and cannot be satisfied for by a finite creature, or by finite sufferings, only through the infinite value of the blood of Christ; here it signifies, that his iniquities were "innumerable" (n), as some versions, they were not to be reckoned up, they were so many; or, more literally, there is "no end of thine iniquities" (o), there is no summing of them up; and it may denote his continuance in them; Eliphaz suggests as if <a href="//biblehub.com/job/54.htm">Job 54</a>ed in sin, and allowed himself in it, and was going on in a course of iniquity without end, which was very uncharitable; here he charges him in a general way, and next he descends to particulars. <p>(n)  Sept.

It is certainly the most natural to refer &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1491;, like &#1497;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500;, to the deceased. The explanation: and over the tomb one keeps watch (Bttch., Hahn, Rd., Olsh.), is indeed in itself admissible, since that which serves as the efficient subject is often left unexpressed (<a href="/genesis/48-2.htm">Genesis 48:2</a>; <a href="/2_kings/9-21.htm">2 Kings 9:21</a>; <a href="/isaiah/53-9.htm">Isaiah 53:9</a>; comp. supra, on <a href="/job/18-18.htm">Job 18:18</a>); but that, according to the prevalent usage of the language, &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1491; would denote only a guard of honour at night, not also in the day, and that for clearness it would have required &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493; instead of &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, are considerations which do not favour this explanation, for &#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1491; signifies to watch, to be active, instead of sleeping or resting; and moreover, the placing of guards of honour by graves is an assumed, but not proved, custom of antiquity. Nevertheless, &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1491; might also in general denote the watchful, careful tending of the grave, and the maqa&#770;m (the tomb) of one who is highly honoured has, according to Moslem custom, servants (cha&#770;dim&#305;&#770;n) who are appointed for this duty. But though the translation "one watches" should not be objected to on this ground, the preference is to be given to a commendable rendering which makes the deceased the subject of &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1491;. Raschi's explanation does not, however, commend itself: "buried in his own land, he also in death still keeps watch over the heaps of sheaves." The lxx translates similarly, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;, which Jerome improperly, but according to a right sentiment, translates, in congerie mortuorum. For after the preceding mention of the pomp of burial, &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, which certainly signifies a heap of sheaves in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/5-26.htm">Job 5:26</a>, is favoured by the assumption of its signifying a sepulchral heap, with reference to which also in that passage (where interment is likewise the subject of discourse) the expression is chosen. Haji Gaon observes that the dome (&#1511;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492;, Arab. qbbt, the dome and the sepulchral monument vaulted over by it)<p>(Note: Vid., Lane's Manners and Customs of the Modern Egyptians (translated by Zenker).)<p>erected over graves according to Arab custom is intended; and Aben-Ezra says, that not exactly this, but in general the grave-mound formed of earth, etc., is to be understood. In reality, &#1490;&#1491;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; (from the verb &#1490;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;, cumulare, commonly used in the Talmud and Aramaic) signifies cumulus, in the most diversified connections, which in Arabic are distributed among the verbs jds, kds, and jds&#780;, especially tumulus, Arab. jadatun (broader pronunciation jadafun). If by grave-mound a mound with the grave upon it can be understood, a beautiful explanation is presented which accords with the preference of the Beduin for being buried on an eminence, in order that even in death he may be surrounded by his relations, and as it were be able still to overlook their encampment: the one who should have had a better lot is buried in the best place of the plain, in an insignificant grave; the rich man, however, is brought up to an eminence and keeps watch on his elevated tomb, since from this eminence as from a watch-tower he even in death, as it were, enjoys the wide prospect which delighted him so while living.<p>(Note: "Take my bones," says an Arabian poem, "and carry them with you, wherever you go; and if ye bury them, bury them opposite your encampment! And bury me not under a vine, which would shade me, but upon a hill, so that my eye can see you!" Vid., Ausland, 1863, Nr. 15 (Ein Ritt nach Transjordanien).)<p>But the signification collis cannot be supported; &#1490;&#1491;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; signifies the hill which is formed by the grave itself, and <a href="/job/21-33.htm">Job 21:33</a> indeed directs us to the wady as the place of burial, not to the hill. But if &#1490;&#1491;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; is the grave-mound, it is also not possible with Schlottm. to think of the pictures on the wall and images of the deceased, as they are found in the Egyptian vaults (although in <a href="/job/3-14.htm">Job 3:14</a> we recognised an allusion to the pyramids), for it cannot then be a &#1490;&#1491;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; in the strict sense that is spoken of; the word ought, like the Arabic jdt&#817; (which the Arab. translation of the New Testament in the London Polyglott uses of the &#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; of Jesus), with a mingling of its original signification, to have been used in the general signification sepulcrum. This would be possible, but it need not be supposed. Job's words are the pictorial antithesis to Bildad's assertion, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/18-17.htm">Job 18:17</a>, that the godless man dies away without trace or memorial; it is not so, but as may be heard from the mouth of people who have experience in the world: he keeps watch over his tomb, he continues to watch although asleep, since he is continually brought to remembrance by the monument built over his tomb. A keeping watch that no one approaches the tomb disrespectfully (Ew.), is not to be thought of. &#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1491; is a relative negation of the sleep of death: he is dead, but in a certain manner he continues to live, viz., in the monument planting forward his memory, which it remains for the imagination to conceive of as a mausoleum, or weapons, or other votive offerings hung upon the walls, etc. In connection with such honour, which follows him even to and beyond death, the clods of the valley (est ei terra levis) are sweet (&#1502;&#1514;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468; is accentuated with Mercha, and &#1500;&#1493; without Makkeph with little-Rebia) to him; and if death in itself ought to be accounted an evil, he has shared the common fate which all men after him will meet, and which all before him have met; it is the common end of all made sweet to him by the pageantry of his burial and his after-fame. Most modern expositors (Ew., Hirz., Umbr., Hlgst., Welte) understand the &#1497;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498;, which is used, certainly, not in the transitive signification: to draw after one's self, but in the intransitive: to draw towards (lxx &#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;), as <a href="/judges/4-6.htm">Judges 4:6</a> (vid., Ges. Thes.), of an imitative treading of the same way; but &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1491;&#1501; would then be an untrue hyperbole, by which Job would expose himself to the attack of his adversaries.<p>In <a href="/job/21-34.htm">Job 21:34</a> Job concludes his speech; the Waw of &#1493;&#1488;&#1497;&#1498;, according to the idea (as e.g., the Waw in &#1493;&#1488;&#1504;&#1497;, <a href="/isaiah/43-12.htm">Isaiah 43:12</a>), is an inferential ergo.
