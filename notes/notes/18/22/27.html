Let us beware of slandering our brethren; and if it be our lot to suffer in this manner, let us remember how Job was treated; yea, how Jesus was reviled, that we may be patient.

To God, and him only; for not a creature, angels, or men, are to be prayed to; and this is to be done in a supplicating, entreating way, as the word signifies; not pleading merit, but mercy, not presenting prayers and supplications for a man's own righteousness' sake, but for the Lord's mercy's sake, and for the sake of Christ and his righteousness; and prayer is to be made in this manner frequently, to be multiplied, as the word also signifies; prayer should be made always, and without ceasing; and this is not only a duty, but a privilege; and as such it is here observed, even as a benefit and blessing to be enjoyed; as it is when a man can come to God as his Father, through Christ the Mediator, with boldness and confidence, in the faith of him, and to God as on a throne of grace, where he may find grace and mercy to help him in time of need, and especially it is so when attended with the success following: <p>and he shall hear thee; as he does hear those that pray to him in the name of Christ, in the exercise of faith, and in the sincerity and uprightness of their hearts; and answers their requests, fulfils their desires, and gives them what they ask of him; for he is a God hearing prayer, and sooner or later, in his own time and way, grants the petitions of his people: <p>and thou shalt pay thy vows; the sacrifices of praise and thanksgiving which he promised to offer up to God, should he grant him the desires of his heart; and these being granted, he would be laid under obligation to perform his promises; so that this also is to be considered as a benefit and blessing; for it does not so much regard the payment of vows, as it is designed to observe to him that he should have that done for him which would be a sufficient ground and reason for paying his vows, or making good what he promised in the time of his distress; since what he then requested, and was the condition of his vow, should now be granted; see <a href="/psalms/56-12.htm">Psalm 56:12</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/22.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him, and he shall hear thee, and thou shalt pay thy vows.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/job/22.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">27</span>. <span class="ital">pay thy vows</span>] In making requests in prayer it was customary to make a vow to sacrifice or offer unto the Lord if the prayer was granted.

Now Job prays, but is not heard; he asks for death, but it does not come; he begs for a respite from suffering, but it is refused him; he beseeches God to enter into argument with him (<a href="/job/9-32.htm">Job 9:32-34</a>; <a href="/job/10-2.htm">Job 10:2</a>), but God vouchsafes no answer. Let him follow Eliphaz's advice, "return to the Almighty" (ver. 23), humble himself in the dust, repent and "put away his iniquity" (ver. 23), and then, Eliphaz promises him, all shall be changed - God will become gracious to him, will listen to him, and grant his requests, will remove his heavy hand, and crown him with mercy and loving-kindness. Then, he adds, <span class="cmt_word">thou shalt pay thy vows.</span> Thou shalt have wealth enough, and strength enough, to pay any vows that thou hast made, which now in thy afflicted state thou canst not do. Vows are part of natural religion, and were widely prevalent over all the East in ancient times. The performance of vows, which was strictly enjoined in the Mosaic Law (<a href="/deuteronomy/23-21.htm">Deuteronomy 23:21</a>), must at all times have been felt as obligatory by the natural conscience. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/22.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>21  Make friends now with Him, so hast thou peace;<p>Thereby good will come unto thee.<p>22  Receive now teaching from His mouth,<p>And place His utterances in thy heart.<p>23  If thou returnest to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up again;<p>If thou puttest away iniquity far from thy tents.<p>24  And lay by in the dust the gold ore,<p>And under the pebbles of the brooks the gold of Ophir.<p>25  So shall the Almighty be to thee gold ore in abundance,<p>And silver to thee of the brightest lustre.<p>The relationship of the verbs &#1505;&#1499;&#1503;, &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1503;, and Arab. sakana, has been already discussed on <a href="/job/22-2.htm">Job 22:2</a> : the Hiph. signifies to be on friendly terms with any one; to enter into, or to stand in, an intimate relationship to any one (<a href="/psalms/139-3.htm">Psalm 139:3</a>); then also (as the Greek &#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;) to get accustomed to, to be used to (<a href="/numbers/22-30.htm">Numbers 22:30</a>). The second imper. is consecutive, as e.g., <a href="/proverbs/3-4.htm">Proverbs 3:4</a> : and have as the result of it peace (Arab. fa'a&#770;slam)  equals  so shalt thou have peace, Ges. 130, 2. In <a href="/job/22-21.htm">Job 22:21</a> the first thing to be done is to clear up the form &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1498; or (according to another reading which is likewise well attested) &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1498;. Olshausen (in Hirz. and in his Gramm.) and Rdiger (in Thes. p. 11, suppl.) explain this form the same as the other forms which come under consideration in connection with it, viz., &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1492; (veniat), <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-16.htm">Deuteronomy 33:16</a>, and &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1488;&#1514;&#1497;, Keri &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1488;&#1514; (et venisses, addressed to Abigail), <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-34.htm">1 Samuel 25:34</a>, as errors in writing; whereas Ew., 191, c, sees in &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1498; the erroneous form &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488;&#1492;  equals  &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488; with a superfluous feminine termination, in &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1492; an extension of the double feminine by the unaccented ah of intention, and in &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1488;&#1514;&#1497; a transfer of the inflexion of the perf. to the fut. Confining ourselves to the form which occurs here, we refer to what was said above: &#1514;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1498; is not a forma mixta from &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488;&#1498; and &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514;&#1498;, but the mistaken double feminine &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488;&#1492; with suff., the ah of which, although the tone is on the penult., is not He voluntativum, as <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/5-19.htm">Isaiah 5:19</a>, but He femin. The exception of such double feminines is made as certain in Hebrew by the regular form &#1504;&#1490;&#1500;&#1514;&#1492; (  equals  &#1504;&#1490;&#1500;&#1514; with a second feminine termination), and by examples like <a href="/proverbs/1-20.htm">Proverbs 1:20</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-20.htm">Ezekiel 23:20</a>, and also <a href="/joshua/6-17.htm">Joshua 6:17</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/1-26.htm">2 Samuel 1:26</a>; <a href="/amos/4-3.htm">Amos 4:3</a> (comp. even Olsh. in his Gramm. S. 449), as the double plural and its further formation by a feminine termination in Arabic. It is therefore unnecessary, with Olsh. and Rd., after the precedent of the ancient versions, to read &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514;&#1498; (which is found in 19 Codd. in de Rossi): proventus tuus bonus erit. The suff. in &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1501;, as <a href="/isaiah/64-4.htm">Isaiah 64:4</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-18.htm">Ezekiel 23:18</a>, comp. &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/38-16.htm">Isaiah 38:16</a>, is intended as neuter, as the fem. is used elsewhere (e.g., <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/38-16.htm">Isaiah 38:16</a>, &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1503;): by it, i.e., by such conduct, good (prosperity) shall come to thee, and indeed, as the &#1489;&#1493;&#1488; construed with the acc. implies, in a sudden change of thy previous lot, coming about without any further effort on thy part. In the certainty that it is God's word which he presents to his friend (the very certainty which Eliphaz also expresses elsewhere, e.g., <a href="/job/15-11.htm">Job 15:11</a>), he further admonishes him (<a href="/job/22-22.htm">Job 22:22</a>) to receive instruction from God's mouth (&#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493; as <a href="/proverbs/2-6.htm">Proverbs 2:6</a>), and to allow His (God's) utterances a place in his heart, not to let them die away without effect, but to imprint them deeply on his mind.</body></html>
