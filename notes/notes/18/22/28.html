Let us beware of slandering our brethren; and if it be our lot to suffer in this manner, let us remember how Job was treated; yea, how Jesus was reviled, that we may be patient.

Strictly speaking, this is only true of God, whose decrees are unfrustrable, whose counsel shall stand, and the thoughts of his heart be established to all generations; and frequently so it is, according to an usual saying, man appoints, but God disappoints; this may be understood of Job, either as a civil magistrate, that he should decree a thing in a court of judicature with so much wisdom and equity, that it should stand firm and sure, and, though made on earth, should be ratified in heaven, as the decrees and doctrines of the apostles of Christ are said to be, <a href="/matthew/16-19.htm">Matthew 16:19</a>; see <a href="/proverbs/8-15.htm">Proverbs 8:15</a>; or, as a private man in civil affairs, signifying that he should be so guided by the Lord, and prospered and succeeded in all his ways and works, that what he determined to do, and formed a scheme for the execution of, it should be brought about and confirmed; he committing his ways to the Lord, his thoughts should be established, or his purposes and designs effected, see <a href="/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3</a>; or rather as a praying man; and so it agrees with what goes before, that he should lift up his voice to God, and pray unto him with success, and have just occasion to praise him, or pay his vows to him, since he should have the desires of his heart; whatever was upon his mind, and he prayed in faith for, he should have it; as Elijah prayed, both that it might not rain, and that it might rain, and both were according to his word, or the decree of his lips in prayer: see <a href="/1_kings/17-1.htm">1 Kings 17:1</a>; <p>and the light shall shine upon thy ways; which is the reason of all things prospering and succeeding, and being established according to his wish and will; the light of grace shining in him, to put him upon and instruct him in denying and avoiding that which is sinful, and doing that which was just and good; and the light of the word without him, being a light unto his feet, and a lamp to his paths, to guide and direct him, and especially the light of God's favour and blessing on him, succeeding him in all his ways and works, and making them prosperous. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/22.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee: and the <span class="cverse3">{t}</span> light shall shine upon thy ways.</span><p>(t) That is, the favour of God.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee</span>. Whatever thou resolvest on, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, God shall ratify with his authority, and bring to pass in due time for thy benefit - a promise which has certainly "a touch of audacity" about it (Cook). David is less bold, but intends to give the same sort of encouragement when he says, "Delight thyself in the Lord, and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart; commit thy way unto the Lord; trust also in him; and he shall bring it to pass (<a href="/psalms/37-4.htm">Psalm 37:4, 5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And the light shall shine upon thy ways</span>. Job had complained of the "darkness" by which his path was shadowed (<a href="/job/19-8.htm">Job 19:8</a>). Eliphaz promises that this cause of complaint shall be removed. Job's way shall be "made plain before his face." A bright light shall illumine it - a light that shall ever "shine more and more unto the perfect day" (<a href="/proverbs/4-18.htm">Proverbs 4:18</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/22.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>21  Make friends now with Him, so hast thou peace;<p>Thereby good will come unto thee.<p>22  Receive now teaching from His mouth,<p>And place His utterances in thy heart.<p>23  If thou returnest to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up again;<p>If thou puttest away iniquity far from thy tents.<p>24  And lay by in the dust the gold ore,<p>And under the pebbles of the brooks the gold of Ophir.<p>25  So shall the Almighty be to thee gold ore in abundance,<p>And silver to thee of the brightest lustre.<p>The relationship of the verbs &#1505;&#1499;&#1503;, &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1503;, and Arab. sakana, has been already discussed on <a href="/job/22-2.htm">Job 22:2</a> : the Hiph. signifies to be on friendly terms with any one; to enter into, or to stand in, an intimate relationship to any one (<a href="/psalms/139-3.htm">Psalm 139:3</a>); then also (as the Greek &#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;) to get accustomed to, to be used to (<a href="/numbers/22-30.htm">Numbers 22:30</a>). The second imper. is consecutive, as e.g., <a href="/proverbs/3-4.htm">Proverbs 3:4</a> : and have as the result of it peace (Arab. fa'a&#770;slam)  equals  so shalt thou have peace, Ges. 130, 2. In <a href="/job/22-21.htm">Job 22:21</a> the first thing to be done is to clear up the form &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1498; or (according to another reading which is likewise well attested) &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1498;. Olshausen (in Hirz. and in his Gramm.) and Rdiger (in Thes. p. 11, suppl.) explain this form the same as the other forms which come under consideration in connection with it, viz., &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1492; (veniat), <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-16.htm">Deuteronomy 33:16</a>, and &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1488;&#1514;&#1497;, Keri &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1488;&#1514; (et venisses, addressed to Abigail), <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-34.htm">1 Samuel 25:34</a>, as errors in writing; whereas Ew., 191, c, sees in &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1498; the erroneous form &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488;&#1492;  equals  &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488; with a superfluous feminine termination, in &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1492; an extension of the double feminine by the unaccented ah of intention, and in &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1488;&#1514;&#1497; a transfer of the inflexion of the perf. to the fut. Confining ourselves to the form which occurs here, we refer to what was said above: &#1514;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1498; is not a forma mixta from &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488;&#1498; and &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514;&#1498;, but the mistaken double feminine &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488;&#1492; with suff., the ah of which, although the tone is on the penult., is not He voluntativum, as <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/5-19.htm">Isaiah 5:19</a>, but He femin. The exception of such double feminines is made as certain in Hebrew by the regular form &#1504;&#1490;&#1500;&#1514;&#1492; (  equals  &#1504;&#1490;&#1500;&#1514; with a second feminine termination), and by examples like <a href="/proverbs/1-20.htm">Proverbs 1:20</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-20.htm">Ezekiel 23:20</a>, and also <a href="/joshua/6-17.htm">Joshua 6:17</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/1-26.htm">2 Samuel 1:26</a>; <a href="/amos/4-3.htm">Amos 4:3</a> (comp. even Olsh. in his Gramm. S. 449), as the double plural and its further formation by a feminine termination in Arabic. It is therefore unnecessary, with Olsh. and Rd., after the precedent of the ancient versions, to read &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514;&#1498; (which is found in 19 Codd. in de Rossi): proventus tuus bonus erit. The suff. in &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1501;, as <a href="/isaiah/64-4.htm">Isaiah 64:4</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-18.htm">Ezekiel 23:18</a>, comp. &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/38-16.htm">Isaiah 38:16</a>, is intended as neuter, as the fem. is used elsewhere (e.g., <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/38-16.htm">Isaiah 38:16</a>, &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1503;): by it, i.e., by such conduct, good (prosperity) shall come to thee, and indeed, as the &#1489;&#1493;&#1488; construed with the acc. implies, in a sudden change of thy previous lot, coming about without any further effort on thy part. In the certainty that it is God's word which he presents to his friend (the very certainty which Eliphaz also expresses elsewhere, e.g., <a href="/job/15-11.htm">Job 15:11</a>), he further admonishes him (<a href="/job/22-22.htm">Job 22:22</a>) to receive instruction from God's mouth (&#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493; as <a href="/proverbs/2-6.htm">Proverbs 2:6</a>), and to allow His (God's) utterances a place in his heart, not to let them die away without effect, but to imprint them deeply on his mind.</body></html>
