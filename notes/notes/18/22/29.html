The counsel Eliphaz here gives is good, though, as to Job, it was built upon a false supposition that he was a stranger and enemy to God. Let us beware of slandering our brethren; and if it be our lot to suffer in this manner, let us remember how Job was treated; yea, how Jesus was reviled, that we may be patient.

You shall then be enabled to say, "there is lifting up, or there is support." Or, more probably still, it may mean, "in times when others are cast down and afflicted, thou shalt be able to raise them up, or to aid them. Thou shalt be able to go to them and say, 'Be of good cheer. Do not be cast down. There is consolation.' And thou shalt be able to procure important blessings for them by thy counsels and prayers;" see the notes at <a href="/job/22-30.htm">Job 22:30</a>.<p>And he shall save the humble person - That is, either, "Thou shalt save the humble person," by a change from the second person to the third, which is not uncommon in Hebrew; or, "thou shalt be able from thine own experience to say, "He," that is, "God," will save the humble person, or the one that is cast down." Margin, "him that hath low eyes." The Hebrew is like the margin. In affliction the eyes are cast upon the ground; and so, also, a casting the eyes to the ground is indicative of dejection, of humility, or of modesty. It refers here to one who experiences trials; and Eliphaz says that Job would be able to save such an one; that is, to support him in his afflictions, and furnish the helps necessary to restore him again to comfort. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>29. Rather, When (thy ways; from Job 22:28) are cast down (for a time), thou shalt (soon again have joyful cause to) say, There is lifting up (prosperity returns back to me) [Maurer].<p>he&#8212;God.<p>humble&#8212;Hebrew, "him that is of low eyes." Eliphaz implies that Job is not so now in his affliction; therefore it continues: with this he contrasts the blessed effect of being humble under it (Jas 4:6; 1Pe 5:5 probably quote this passage). Therefore it is better, I think, to take the first clause as referred to by "God resisteth the proud." When (men) are cast down, thou shalt say (behold the effects of) pride. Eliphaz hereby justifies himself for attributing Job's calamities to his pride. "Giveth grace to the humble," answers to the second clause.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/job/22.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">When men are cast down, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">When they</span> (i.e. they who do this work.

So the sense is, When there shall come a general calamity, which shall sweep away all the wicked round about them. Or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2.

Wicked men are brought down from a state of prosperity to a state of adversity, are in low circumstances, great straits and difficulties: <p>then thou shall say, there is lifting up; that is, for himself and his; when others are in adversity, he should be in prosperity; when others are cast down into a very low estate and distressed condition, he should be exalted to a very high estate, and be in affluent circumstances, see <a href="/psalms/147-6.htm">Psalm 147:6</a>; or else the sense is, when thou and thine, and what belong to thee, are humbled and brought low, then thou mayest promise thyself a restoration and change for the better; and boldly say, they will be lifted up, and raised up again, since God's usual method is to exalt the humble, and to abase the proud, <a href="/luke/14-11.htm">Luke 14:11</a>; or rather, this may respect the benefit and advantage that humble persons wound gain by Job, and his prayers for them, and may be rendered and interpreted thus: "when they have humbled" (q) themselves, and bowed themselves low at thy feet, and especially before God, "then thou shall say", pray unto God for them, that "there may be a lifting up", raising them up out of their low estate, and thou shall be heard: <p>and he shall save the humble person; that is, "low of eyes" (r), humble in his eyes; who is so pressed with troubles and distress, that he hangs down his head, looks upon the ground, and will not lift up his eyes, but is of a dejected countenance; or that is low in his own eyes, has humble thoughts of himself, esteems others better than himself, and lies low before God under a sense of his sinfulness and unworthiness, and casts himself entirely upon the grace and mercy of God; such an one he saves, in a spiritual sense, out of his troubles and afflictions; he does not forget the cry of such humble ones, but remembers them, and grants their desires: and he saves the lowly and humble with a spiritual and eternal salvation; gives more grace unto them, and outfits them for glory, and at last gives glory itself; raises them on high to sit among princes, and to inherit the throne of glory; the meek shall inherit the earth, the new heavens and earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness, <a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>. <p>(q)  "quum humiliaverint", Montanus, Cocceius, Michaelis.

The promissory &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; is surrounded by conditional clauses, for <a href="/job/22-23.htm">Job 22:23</a> (comp. <a href="/job/11-14.htm">Job 11:14</a>) is a second conditional clause still under the government of &#1488;&#1501;, which is added for embellishment; it opens the statement of that in which penitence must be manifested, if it is to be thorough. The lxx translates &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#834;&#837;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#837;&#x3c2;, i.e., &#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1504;&#1492;, which Ewald considers as the original; the omission of the &#1488;&#1501; (which the poet otherwise in such connections has formerly heaped up, e.g., <a href="/job/8-5.htm">Job 8:5</a>., <a href="/job/11-13.htm">Job 11:13</a>) is certainly inconvenient. And yet we should not on that account like to give up the figure indicated in &#1514;&#1489;&#1504;&#1492;, which is so beautiful and so suited to our poet. The statement advanced in the latter conditional clause is then continued in <a href="/job/22-24.htm">Job 22:24</a> in an independent imperative clause, which the old versions regard as a promise instead of exhortation, and therefore grossly misinterpret. The Targ. translates: and place on the dust a strong city (i.e., thou shalt then, where there is now nothing but dust, raise up such), as if &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1512; could be equivalent to &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1503; or &#1502;&#1489;&#1510;&#1512;, - a rendering to which Saadia at least gives a turn which accords with the connection: "regard the stronghold (Arab. 'l-h&#803;s&#803;n) as dust, and account as the stones of the valleys the gold of Ophir;" better than Eichhorn: "pull down thy stronghold of violence, and demolish (&#1492;&#1508;&#1497;&#1512;) the castles of thy valleys." On the other hand, Gecatilia, who understands &#1489;&#1510;&#1512; proportionately more correctly of treasures, translates it as a promise: so shalt thou inherit treasures (Arab. dcha&#770;yr) more numerous than dust, and gold ore (Arab. tbr') (more than) the stones of the valleys; and again also Rosenm. (repones prae pulvere argentum) and Welte interpret <a href="/job/22-24.htm">Job 22:24</a> as a promise; whereas other expositors, who are true to the imperative &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514;, explain &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514; ni aestimare, and &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1506;&#1508;&#1512; pulveris instar (Grot., Cocc., Schult., Dathe, Umbr.), by falsely assigning to &#1506;&#1500; here, as to &#1500; elsewhere, a meaning which it never has anywhere; how blind, on the other hand, since the words in their first meaning, pone super pulverem, furnish an excellent thought which is closely connected with the admonition to rid one's self of unjust possessions. &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1512;, like Arab. tibr (by which Abulwalid explains it), is gold and silver ore, i.e., gold and silver as they are broken out of the mine, therefore (since silver is partially pure, gold almost pure, and always containing more or less silver) the most precious metal in its pure natural state before being worked, and consequently also unalloyed (comp. Arab. nd&#803;&#305;&#770;r and nud&#803;a&#770;r, which likewise signifies aurum argentumve nativum, but not ab excidendo, but a nitore); and "to lay in the dust" is equivalent to, to part with a thing as entirely worthless and devoid of attraction. The meaning is therefore: put away from thee the idol of previous metal with contempt (comp. <a href="/isaiah/2-20.htm">Isaiah 2:20</a>), which is only somewhat differently expressed in the parallel: lay the Ophir under the quartz (&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; agreeing with &#1489;&#1510;&#1512;) of the brooks (such as is found in the beds of empty wdys), i.e., place it under the rubble, after it has lost for thee its previous bewitching spell.

The matter is still not settled.)<p>is directly called &#1488;&#1493;&#1508;&#1497;&#1512;. When Job thus casts from him temporal things, by the excessive cherishing of which he has hitherto sinned, then God himself will be his imperishable treasure, his everlasting higher delight.

This is what the contrast of the plur. (&#1489;&#1510;&#1512;&#1498; without Jod plur. is a false reading) with the sing. implies; the lxx, Syriac version, Jerome, and Arabic version err here, since they take the &#1489;&#1468; of &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1512;&#1497;&#1498; as a preposition.<p>The ancient versions and lexicographers furnish no explanation of &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1506;&#1508;&#1493;&#1514;.

Accordingly, we must go back to the root &#1493;&#1507;, &#1497;&#1507;, discussed on <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/95-4.htm">Psalm 95:4</a>, which signifies to rise aloft, to be high, and from which &#1497;&#1508;&#1506;, or with a transposition of the consonants &#1497;&#1506;&#1507; (comp. &#1506;&#1497;&#1507; and &#1497;&#1506;&#1507;), acquires the signification of standing out, rising radiantly, shining afar off, since &#1497;&#1506;&#1507;, to become weary, is allied to the Arab. wgf, fut. i; this &#1497;&#1506;&#1507; (&#1497;&#1508;&#1506;), on the other hand, to Arab. yf', ascendere, adolescere, Arab. wf&#8219;, elatum, adultum esse, and Arab. wfa&#770;, eminere, and tropically completum, perfectum esse. Thus we obtain the signification enimentiae for &#1514;&#1493;&#1506;&#1508;&#1493;&#1514;. In <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/95-4.htm">Psalm 95:4</a>, as a numerical plur., it signifies the towerings (tops) of the mountains, and here, as in the passages cited from Numbers, either prominent, eminent attributes, or as an intensive plur. excellence; whence, agreeing with Ewald, we have translated "silver of the brightest lustre" (comp. &#1497;&#1508;&#1506;&#1492;, eminentia, splendor, <a href="/ezekiel/28-7.htm">Ezekiel 28:7</a>). </body></html>
