What Eliphaz says, is unjustly applied to Job, but it is very true, that when God does us good it is not because he is indebted to us. Man's piety is no profit to God, no gain. The gains of religion to men are infinitely greater than the losses of it. God is a Sovereign, who gives no account of his conduct; but he is perfectly wise, just, faithful, good, and merciful. He approves the likeness of his own holiness, and delights in the fruits of his Spirit; he accepts the thankful services of the humble believer, while he rejects the proud claim of the self-confident.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Is it any pleasure to the Almighty that thou art righteous? - This is the same sentiment which was advanced in the previous verse. The meaning is, that it can be no advantage to God that a man is righteous. He is not dependent on man for happiness, and cannot be deterred from dealing justly with him because he is in danger of losing anything. In this sense, it is true. God "has" pleasure in holiness wherever it is, and is pleased when people are righteous; but it is not true that he is dependent on the character of his creatures for his own happiness, or that people can lay him under obligation by their own righteousness. Eliphaz applies this general truth to Job, probably, because he understood him as complaining of the dealings of God with him, as if he had laid God under obligation by his upright life. He supposes that it was implied in the remarks of Job, that he had been so upright, and had been of so much consequence, that God "ought" to have continued him in a state of prosperity. This supposition, if Job ever had it, Eliphaz correctly meets, and shows him that he was not so profitable to God that he could not do without him. Yet, do people not often feel thus? Do ministers of the gospel not sometimes feel thus? Do we not sometimes feel thus in relation to some man eminent for piety, wisdom, or learning? Do we not feel as if God could not do without him, and that there was a sort of necessity that he should keep him alive? Yet, how often are such people cut down, in the very midst of their usefulness, to show<p>(1) that God is not dependent on them; and<p>(2) to keep them from pride, as if they were necessary to the execution of the divine plans; and<p>(3) to teach his people their dependence on "Him," and not on frail, erring mortals. When the church places its reliance on a human arm, God very often suddenly knocks the prop away. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. pleasure&#8212;accession of happiness; God has pleasure in man's righteousness (Ps 45:7), but He is not dependent on man's character for His happiness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/job/22.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Any pleasure, </span> i.e. such a pleasure as he needs for his own ease and contentment, without which he could not be happy, as appears by the foregoing and following words; for otherwise God is oft said to delight in the good actions of his people, to wit, so far as to approve and accept them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">That thou makest thy ways perfect; </span> that thy life is free from blemish, as thou pretendest, but falsely, as I shall show. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/job/22.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Is it any pleasure to the Almighty that thou art righteous?.... It is not; the Lord indeed takes pleasure in his people, not as sinners, but as righteous; and as they are considered such in Christ, he is well pleased for his righteousness' sake, and with it, being agreeable to his nature, will, and law; and with his people in Christ, in whom they are accepted, having imputed the righteousness of his Son unto them, and so they stand before him unblamable and irreprovable, and he takes pleasure in the work of his own hands upon them, called the good pleasure of his will, in the new man formed after his image in righteousness and true holiness, in the graces of his Spirit, and in the exercise of them, faith, hope, love, humility, fear of God, &amp;c. it is a pleasure to him to hear their prayers and praises, and to observe their ready and cheerful obedience to his will; but then all this gives him no new pleasure, or adds anything to the complacency of his mind; he would have had as much delight and pleasure within himself, if there had never been an holy angel in heaven, or a righteous man on earth; he has no such pleasure in either as to be made more happy thereby, or so as to receive any "gain" or profit from it, as the next clause explains it. Some render it, "that thou justifiest thyself" (k), or "that thou art just", or "seemest to be righteous to thyself" (l); a self-righteous person is not pleasing to God; it is no pleasure to him when a man seeks for justification by his own works, or reckons them his righteousness; the publican that confessed his sin was rather justified with God than the Pharisee that applauded his own righteousness; such that are conceited of their own righteousness, and despise others, are an offence to God, a "smoke in his nose", <a href="/isaiah/65-5.htm">Isaiah 65:5</a>; for the righteousness of such is not real righteousness in the account of God, and according to his law; it has only the shadow and appearance of one, but is not truly so; and besides, to seek righteousness this way is going contrary to the revealed will of God, to the Gospel scheme of justification by faith in Christ's righteousness, without the works of the law, and is a setting aside his righteousness, and frustrating and making null and void the death of Christ, and therefore can never be pleasing in the sight of God: <p>or is it gain to him that thou makest thy ways perfect? no man's ways are perfect before God, even the best of men have detects in their works, and failings in their walk and conversations: some men's ways are indeed clean in their own eyes, and perfect in their own conceit; and if Eliphaz thought Job such an one, he was mistaken, see <a href="/job/9-20.htm">Job 9:20</a>; there are others, who are in a sense unblamable in their walk and conversation; that is, are not guilty of any notorious crime, but exercise a conscience void of offence towards God and man, walk in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless; and yet this is no "gain" to God; for what does such a man give to him? or what does he receive of his hands? see <a href="/job/35-7.htm">Job 35:7</a>.

The Piel &#1504;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;, proceeding from the radical meaning to gaze fixedly, is an enantio'seemon, since it signifies both to have regard to, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/34-19.htm">Job 34:19</a>, and to disown, <a href="/deuteronomy/32-27.htm">Deuteronomy 32:27</a>; here it is to be translated: their &#1488;&#1514;&#1514; ye cannot nevertheless deny, ignore (as Arab. nakira and ankara). &#1488;&#1514;&#1514; are tokens, here: remarkable things, and indeed the remarkable histories related by them; Arab. a&#770;yatun (collective plur. a&#770;yun), signs, is also similarly used in the signification of Arab. &#8219;ibrat, example, historical teaching.<p>That the &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/21-30.htm">Job 21:30</a>, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/21-28.htm">Job 21:28</a>, introduces the view of the friends, and is the antecedent clause to <a href="/job/21-31.htm">Job 21:31</a> : quod (si) vos dicitis, in tempora cladis per iram divinam immissae servari et nescium futuri velut pecudem eo deduci improbum (Bttcher, de fin. 76), has in the double &#1500; an apparent support, which is not to be denied, especially in regard to <a href="/job/38-23.htm">Job 38:23</a>; it is, however, on account of the omission of the indispensable &#1514;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493; in this instance, an explanation which does violence to the words.
