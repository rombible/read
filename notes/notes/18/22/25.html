The counsel Eliphaz here gives is good, though, as to Job, it was built upon a false supposition that he was a stranger and enemy to God. Let us beware of slandering our brethren; and if it be our lot to suffer in this manner, let us remember how Job was treated; yea, how Jesus was reviled, that we may be patient. Let us examine whether there may not be some colour for the slander, and walk watchfully, so as to be clear of all appearances of evil.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Yea, the Almighty shall be - Or, rather, "then the Almighty shall be" - &#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492;  yeha&#770;ya&#770;h. The meaning is, that if he would return to God, and cast off his anxiety for gold, "then" the Almighty would be his real treasure, and would impart to him solid happiness.<p>Thy defense - Margin, "gold." The margin is the more correct translation. The word is the same which occurs in the previous verse &#1489;&#1510;&#1512;  betser, and there rendered "gold." The word may have the sense of "defense," as the verb &#1489;&#1510;&#1512;  ba&#770;tsar is often used with such a reference; <a href="/numbers/13-28.htm">Numbers 13:28</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/1-28.htm">Deuteronomy 1:28</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/3-5.htm">Deuteronomy 3:5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-1.htm">Deuteronomy 9:1</a>, et al. The meaning of such places, where the word is applied to walled towns or fortified places, is, that the enemy was, by means of walls, "cut off" from approach. Here, however, the idea of "gold" or "treasure" better suits the connection, and the meaning is, that "God" would be to him an invaluable "treasure" or source of happiness.<p>And thou shalt have plenty of silver - Margin, "silver of strength." The correct idea, however, is, "and the Almighty shall be treasures of silver unto thee;" that is, he shall be better to you than an abundance of the precious metals. The Hebrew is literally, "And silver of treasures unto thee." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>25.

God is instead of all riches to his people; and they that have an interest in him share in the riches of grace, and are entitled to the riches of glory; all are theirs: <p>and thou shall have plenty of silver; or God shall be, or "let him be to thee silver of strength" (p); or instead of silver, which is the strength of men, in which they confide for business or war; but God is to his people infinitely more than what silver or gold can be to them. <p>(o) "lectissimum aurum tuum", Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator; so Vatablus, Schmidt, Schultens; so R.
