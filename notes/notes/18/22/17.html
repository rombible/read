It is good for us to mark it, that we may not walk therein. But if others are consumed, and we are not, instead of blaming them, and lifting up ourselves, as Eliphaz does here, we ought to be thankful to God, and take it for a warning.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Which said unto God, Depart from us - Notes, <a href="/job/21-14.htm">Job 21:14</a>. A very correct description of the old world. They had no wish to retain God in their knowledge. Probably Eliphaz here refers to what Job had said, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/21-14.htm">Job 21:14-15</a>. He had remarked, in describing the wicked, that they said unto God, "Depart from us," and yet they lived prosperously. "But see," says Eliphaz,'" a case" where they did this. It was done by the inhabitants of the world before the deluge, and their houses were filled, as you say the houses of the wicked are, with good things, but God swept them all suddenly away."<p>And what can the Almighty do for them? - Margin, or," to." That is, they demanded what the Almighty could do for them. They did not feel their dependence on him; they did not admit that they needed his aid; they cast off all reliance on him. This whole passage is a most sarcastic retort on what Job had said in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/21-14.htm">Job 21:14-15</a>. He had affirmed that though wicked people used this language, yet that they prospered. Eliphaz takes the same language and applies it to the sinners before the deluge, and says that they expressed themselves just in this manner. The language which Job puts into the mouths of the wicked, had indeed, says Eliphaz, been used. But by whom? By those who lived in security and prosperity. "By the men before the deluge," says he, "the race that was so wicked that it was necessary to cut them off by the flood. These are the people to whose sentiments Job appeals; these the people with whom he has sympathy!" <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17.

Choosing not to be admonished of their sins, nor be exhorted to repentance for them, nor be instructed by him in the way of their duty, nor to attend the worship and ordinances of God, nor be under his rule and government; the same is observed by Job of wicked men, but to a different purpose; he makes this to be the language of such who were in very prosperous circumstances, and continued in them, notwithstanding their impiety; here by this Eliphaz describes such persons who were cut off, and destroyed for their wickedness, see <a href="/job/21-14.htm">Job 21:14</a>; <p>and what can the Almighty do for them? that is, for us; for these are either the words of the wicked continued, being so self-sufficient, and full of good things, having as much, or more, than heart can wish, that they stood in no need of anything from God; nor could they imagine they should receive any profit and advantage from him, by listening to his instructions, or obeying his will; they had such low and mean thoughts of God, that he would neither do them good nor evil; they expected no good from him, and feared no ill at his hands; they ascribed all the good things they had to their own care, industry, and diligence; and when any ill befell them, they attributed it to chance, and second causes, thinking nothing of God: as these are the words of Eliphaz, they may be rendered, "what has the Almighty done to them", or "against them?" (e) what injury has he done them, or ill will has he shown them, that they should treat him in so contemptuous a manner? so far from it, that he has bestowed abundance of good things on them, as follows, see <a href="/jeremiah/2-5.htm">Jeremiah 2:5</a>. <p>(e)    "et quid fecerat omnipotens illis?"

Eliphaz tries, though with no very great success, <span class="accented">to</span> turn Job's words against him. And, What can the Almighty do for them? <span class="accented">i.e. and ask what the Almighty can do for them.</span> A change from the second to the third person, without any change of subject, is not unusual in Hebrew. The wicked renounce God, and bid him depart from them - conduct which they justify by asking what good he could do them if they acted otherwise. The idea is the same as that of <a href="/job/21-15.htm">Job 21:15</a>, though not expressed so pointedly. What Eliphaz thinks to gain by echoing Job's words is not very apparent. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/22.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>10  Therefore snares are round about thee,<p>And fear terrifieth thee suddenly;<p>11  Or percievest thou not the darkness,<p>And the overflow of waters, which covereth thee?<p>On account of this inhuman mode of action by which he has challenged the punishment of justice, snares are round about him (comp. Bildad's picture of this fate of the evil-doer, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/18-8.htm">Job 18:8-10</a>), destruction encompasses him on every side, so that he sees no way out, and must without any escape succumb to it. And the approaching ruin makes itself known to him time after time by terrors which come suddenly upon him and disconcert him; so that his outward circumstances being deranged and his mind discomposed, he has already in anticipation to taste that which is before him. In <a href="//biblehub.com/job/22-11.htm">Job 22:11</a>, &#1500;&#1488; &#1514;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; is by no means to be taken as an eventual circumstantial clause, whether it is translated affirmatively: or darkness (covers thee), that thou canst not see; or interrogatively: or does darkness (surround thee), that thou seest not? In both cases the verb in the principal clause is wanting; apart from the new turn, which &#1488;&#1493; introduces, being none, it would then have to be explained with Lwenthal: or has the habit of sinning already so dulled thy feeling and darkened thine eye, that thou canst not perceive the enormity of thy transgression? But this is a meaning forced from the words which they are not capable of; it must have been at least &#1488;&#1493; &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498; &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1491;&#1498;, or something similar. Since &#1488;&#1493; &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498; (to be accented without Makkeph with Mnach, Dech) cannot form a principal clause of itself, &#1514;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; is without doubt the verb belonging to it: or (&#1488;&#1493; as <a href="/job/16-3.htm">Job 16:3</a>) seest thou not darkness? Because, according to his preceding speeches, Job does not question the magnitude of his sufferings, but acknowledges them in all their fearfulness; therefore Hahn believes it must be explained: or shouldst thou really not be willing to see thy sins, which encompass thee as thick dark clouds, which cover thee as floods of water? The two figures, however, can only be understood of the destruction which entirely shrouds Job in darkness, and threatens to drown him. But destruction, in the sense in which Eliphaz asks if Job does not see it, is certainly intended differently to what it was in Job's complaints. Job complains of it as being unmerited, and therefore mysterious; Eliphaz, on the other hand, is desirous that he should open his eyes that he may perceive in this darkness of sorrow, this flood of suffering, the well-deserved punishment of his heinous sins, and anticipate the worst by penitence. &#1500;&#1488; &#1514;&#1499;&#1505;&#1468;&#1498;&#1468; is a relative clause, and belongs logically also to &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498;, comp. <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/60-2.htm">Isaiah 60:2</a>, where &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1506;&#1514; is also found in <a href="/job/22-6.htm">Job 22:6</a> (from &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1506;, abundare; comp. Arab. s&#780;f&#8219;, &#1505;&#1508;&#1511;, <a href="/job/20-22.htm">Job 20:22</a>). Eliphaz now insinuates that Job denies the special providence of God, because he doubts the exceptionless, just government of God. In the second strophe he has explained his affliction as the result of his uncharitableness; now he explains it as the result of his unbelief, which is now become manifest. </body></html>
