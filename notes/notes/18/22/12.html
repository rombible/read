That is, Is not God exalted over all worlds? This seems to be intended to refer to the sentiments of Job, as if he had maintained that God was so exalted that he could not notice what was occurring on earth. It should, therefore, be read in connection with the following verse: "God is so exalted, that thou sayest, How can he know? Can he look down through the thick clouds which intervene between him and man?" Job had maintained no such opinion, but the process of thought in the mind of Eliphaz seems to have been this. Job had maintained that God did "not" punish the wicked in this life as they deserved, but that they lived and prospered. Eliphaz "inferred" that he could hold that opinion only because he supposed that God was so exalted that he could not attend to worldly affairs. He knew no other way in which the opinion could be held, and he proceeds to argue "as if" it were so.<p>Job had in the previous chapter appealed to plain "facts," and had rested his whole argument on them. Eliphaz, instead of meeting the "facts" in the case, or showing that they did not exist as Job said they did, considered his discourse as a denial of Divine Providence, and as representing God to be so far above the earth that he could not notice what was occurring here. How common is this in theological controversy! One man, in defending his opinions, or in searching for the truth, appeals to "facts," and endeavors to ascertain their nature and bearing. His adversary, instead of meeting them, or showing that they are not so, at once appeals to some admitted doctrine, to some established article of a creed, or to some tradition of the fathers, and says that the appeal to fact is but a denial of an important doctrine of revelation. It is easier to charge a man with denying the doctrine of Providence, or to call him by a harsh name, than it is to meet an argument drawn from fact and from the plain meaning of the Bible.<p>And behold the height of the stars - Margin, as in Hebrew "head" - &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;  ro&#770;'sh. God is more exalted than the highest of the stars.

And therefore, O Job, thou art grossly mistaken, in thinking that all things in this lower world are managed by chance, and without any regard to justice, or to just men, and not by the wise and holy providence of God; for this is the genuine consequence of thy great principle, that good men suffer as deeply as any others, whilst the vilest of men are exalted and flourish. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Behold the height of the stars, how high they are; </span> yet God is far higher than they, and from thence can easily spy all men and things here below; as the highest places afford the best prospects. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/job/22.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Is not God in the height of heaven?.... The heaven is high, it has its name from its height, and is noted for it; some of the heavens are higher than others, as the heaven of heavens, the third heaven, the habitation of angels and glorified saints; and here God dwells, this is the habitation of his holiness, and the high and holy place he inhabits; his throne is in heaven, in the heaven of heavens is his throne, where he in an especial manner manifests his glory, and the lustre of it; he is not indeed continued here, the heaven of heavens cannot contain him, he is everywhere; yet this is his court and palace, where his residence and retinue is and angels behold his face, and wait upon him; and because this is the principal seat of his majesty, it becomes one of his names, <a href="/daniel/4-26.htm">Daniel 4:26</a>; and the words here will bear to be rendered, "is not God the height of the heavens?" (t) or, as the Vulgate Latin version, "higher than the heavens"; he is above them, more exalted than they, being the Creator of them, see <a href="/hebrews/7-26.htm">Hebrews 7:26</a>; <p>and behold the height of the stars, how high they are; or "the head" or "top of the stars" (u), which Ben Gersom interprets of the supreme orb, or that high and vast space in which the fixed stars are, or the highest of them, which are at the greatest distance; according to Mr. Huygens (w) a cannon ball discharged would be twenty five years in passing from the earth to the sun, from, Jupiter to the sun an hundred twenty five years, from Saturn two hundred fifty, and from the sun to the dog star (v) 691,600 years; and if therefore it would be so long going to the nearest of the fixed stars, how great must be the distance of them from our earth, which are so much higher than the dog star as that is from the sun? But, though these are so exceeding high, yet God is higher than they, see <a href="/isaiah/14-13.htm">Isaiah 14:13</a>; the truth contained in these words was what both Eliphaz and Job were agreed in, let them be spoken by which they will, some ascribing them to the One, and some to the other; from whence Eliphaz represents Job drawing an inference very impious, blasphemous, and atheistical. <p>(t)  "sublimitas coelorum", Bolducius; "altitudo coeli", Michaelis; "altitudo coelorum", Schultens.

He  does not acknowledge, Eliphaz says, either the majesty or the omniscience of God. Here he has, at any rate, some tangible ground for his reproaches. Job's words have been over-bold, over-venturesome. He has seemed to forget the distance between God and man (<a href="/job/9-30.htm">Job 9:30-33</a>; <a href="/job/10-2.htm">Job 10:2, 3</a>; <a href="/job/13-3.htm">Job 13:3</a>, etc.), and to call in question either God's omniscience or his regard for moral distinctions (<a href="/job/9-22.htm">Job 9:22, 23</a>; <a href="/job/21-7.htm">Job 21:7-13, 23-26</a>). Hence Eliphaz is enabled to take a high tone and ask, "Hast thou forgotten that God is in the height of heaven, far up above all us poor wretched mortals? Dost thou need to be reminded of this? He is above the stars, and yet behold the height of the stars, how high they are! Even they are infinitely above men, yet how far below <span class="accented">him</span>!"

Job must have committed such sins as are here cited; therefore Eliphaz directly attributes guilt to him, since he thinks thus to tear down the disguise of the hypocrite. The strophe contains no reference to the Mosaic law: the compassionate Mosaic laws respecting duties towards widows and orphans, and the poor who pledge their few and indispensable goods, may have passed before the poet's mind; but it is not safe to infer it from the expression. As specific Mohammedan commandments among the wandering tribes even in the present day have no sound, so the poet dare not assume, in connection with the characters of his drama, any knowledge, of the Sinaitic law; and of this he remains conscious throughout: their standpoint is and remains that of the Abrahamic faith, the primary commands (later called the ten commands of piety, el-fela&#770;hh) of which were amply sufficient for stigmatizing that to which this strophe gives prominence as sin. It is only the force of the connection of the matter here which gives the futt. which follow &#1499;&#1497; a retrospective meaning. &#1495;&#1489;&#1500; is connected either with the accusative of the thing for which the pledge is taken, as in the law, which meets a response in the heart, <a href="/exodus/22-25.htm">Exodus 22:25</a>.; or with the accus. of the person who is seized, as here &#1488;&#1495;&#1497;&#1498;; or, if this is really (as Br asserts) a mistake that has gained a footing, which has Codd. and old printed editions against it, rather &#1488;&#1495;&#1497;&#1498;. lxx, Targ., Syr., and Jer. read the word as plural. &#1506;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; (from &#1506;&#1512;&#1493;&#1501;), like &#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;, <a href="//biblehub.com/james/2-15.htm">James 2:15</a>, nudi (comp.
