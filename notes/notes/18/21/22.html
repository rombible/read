Thus, as Job had introduced the foregoing particular, namely, that wicked men are sometimes severely punished in this world, by an easy transition, at <a href="/job/21-16.htm" title="See, their good is not in their hand: the counsel of the wicked is far from me.">Job 21:16</a>; so, by another as easy, he here introduces the remaining article of his discourse above mentioned, namely, that God deals out things promiscuously in this world, not according to men’s merit or demerit, which he pursues in the following verses.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/job/21.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>21:17-26 Job had described the prosperity of wicked people; in these verses he opposes this to what his friends had maintained about their certain ruin in this life. He reconciles this to the holiness and justice of God. Even while they prosper thus, they are light and worthless, of no account with God, or with wise men. In the height of their pomp and power, there is but a step between them and ruin. Job refers the difference Providence makes between one wicked man and another, into the wisdom of God. He is Judge of all the earth, and he will do right. So vast is the disproportion between time and eternity, that if hell be the lot of every sinner at last, it makes little difference if one goes singing thither, and another sighing. If one wicked man die in a palace, and another in a dungeon, the worm that dies not, and the fire that is not quenched, will be the same to them. Thus differences in this world are not worth perplexing ourselves about.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Shall any teach God knowledge? - This commences the reply of Job to the sentiments of his friends to which he had just adverted. The substance of the reply is, that no one could prescribe to God how he should deal with people, and that it; was not a FACT that people were treated as they had supposed. Instead of its being true, as they maintained, that wicked people would all be cut down in some fearful and violent manner, as a punishment for their sins, Job goes on <a href="//biblehub.com/job/21-23.htm">Job 21:23-26</a> to show that they died in a great variety of ways - one in full age and prosperity, and another in another manner. This, he says, God directs as he pleases. No one can teach him knowledge; no one can tell him what he ought to do. The reasoning of his friends, Job seems to imply, had been rather an attempt to teach God how he "ought" to deal with people, than a patient and candid inquiry into the "facts" in the case, and he says the facts were not as they supposed they ought to be.<p>Seeing he judgeth those that are high - Or rather, he judges "among the things" that are high. He rules over the great affairs of the universe, and it is presumptuous in us to attempt to prescribe to him how he shall govern the world. The design of this and the following verses is to show, that, from the manner in which people actually die, no argument can be derived to determine what was their religious condition, or their real character. Nothing is more fallacious than that kind of reasoning. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22. Reply of Job, "In all these assertions you try to teach God how He ought to deal with men, rather than prove that He does in fact so deal with them. Experience is against you. God gives prosperity and adversity as it pleases Him, not as man's wisdom would have it, on principles inscrutable to us" (Isa 40:13; Ro 11:34).<p>those &#8230; high&#8212;the high ones, not only angels, but men (Isa 2:12-17).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/job/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Knowledge, </span> i.e. discretion, or how to govern the world.

Will anyone be so bold and audacious as to pretend to direct and instruct him whom he shall afflict, and whom not, and when he shall do it, and in what manner? should not these things be left to him, who does all things after the counsel of his own will? shall his dealings with men in an outward way of providence be the criterions of the characters and estates of men, as if love and hatred were to be known by those things, and therefore God must be taught what he should do in order to fix them? <p>seeing he judgeth those that are high; not the high heavens, as the Targum, nor the angels in them, though he has judged them that sinned, and cast them down to hell; but the high ones on earth, kings, princes, and civil magistrates, such as are in high places, and are lifted up with pride above others: God is above them; he is higher than the highest, and judges them; he is the Judge of all the earth, that will do right, the Governor of the universe, and who overrules all things for his own glory and the good of his creatures; and therefore none should pretend to direct him what is fit and proper to be done by him, who is a Sovereign, and distinguishes men in his providence, in life, and at death, as follows; but their characters, as good or bad men, are not to be determined thereby. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/21.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Shall <i>any</i> teach <span class="cverse3">{l}</span> God knowledge? seeing he judgeth those that are high.</span><p>(l) Who sends to the wicked prosperity and punishes the godly.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/job/21.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">22</span>.

By insisting on a doctrine of providence which did not correspond to God’s providence as actually seen in facts, Job’s friends were making themselves wiser than God and becoming His teachers—Will any teach knowledge unto God? Shall we insist on His method of government being what it plainly is not? This is what it is: One man dieth in his full prosperity,—wholly at ease and quiet. Another man dieth in the bitterness of his soul and has not tasted pleasure. They lie down alike in the dust and the worm covers them. Their different fortune is not determined by their different character. The one is not good and the other wicked. But God distributes to them as He chooses.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Shall any teach God knowledge?</span> Job has been searching the "deep things of God," speculating upon the method of the Divine government of the world, he has perhaps rashly ventured to "rush in where angels fear to tread." Now, however, he cheeks himself with the confession that God's ways are inscrutable, his knowledge far beyond any knowledge possessed by man. Men must not presume to judge him; it is for him to judge them. <span class="cmt_word">Seeing he judgeth those that are high</span>. None so exalted, none so advanced in wisdom and knowledge, none so venturesome in sounding depths that they cannot fathom, but God is above them, judges them, knows their hearts, and, according to his infallible wisdom, condemns or approves them. This is a chastening thought, and its effect on Job is to make him contract his sails, and, leaving the empyrean, content himself with s lower flight. Previously he has maintained, as if he were admitted to the Divine counsels, that the prosperity of the wicked was a rule of God's government. Now he goes no further than to say that there is no rule discoverable. Happiness and misery are dispensed - as far as man can see - on no definite principle, and, at the end, one lot happens to all: all go down into the tomb, and lie in the dust, and the worms devour them (vers. 23-26). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/21.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>12  They raise their voice with the playing of timbrel aud harp,<p>And rejoice at the sound of the pipe<p>13  They enjoy their days in prosperity,<p>And in a moment they go down to Sehol.<p>14  And yet they said to God: "Depart from us!<p>We desire not the knowledge of Thy ways.<p>15  What is the Almighty, that we should serve Him? - <p>And what doth it profit us that we should importune Him?" - <p>16  Lo! they have not their prosperity by their own hand,<p>The thought of the wicked be far from me!<p>&#1511;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501; is to be supplied to &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/42-11.htm">Isaiah 42:11</a>, and instead of &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1507; with &#1489;&#1468; of the musical accompaniment (as <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/4-1.htm">Psalm 4:1</a>, <a href="/psalms/49-5.htm">Psalm 49:5</a>), it is to be read &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1507; after the Masora with Kimchi, Ramban, Ralbag, and Farisol,<p>(Note: The Masora observes &#1500;&#1497;&#1514; &#1499;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1492; (not occuring thus elsewhere), and accordingly this &#1499;&#1514;&#1507; is distinguished in the Masoretic &#1488;&#1489; &#1502;&#1503; &#1495;&#1491; &#1495;&#1491; &#1504;&#1505;&#1489;&#1497;&#1503; &#1499;&#1507; &#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1492; (alphabetic list of words which take at one time the prefix &#1499; and at another the prefix )&#1489;, from &#1489;&#1514;&#1507;, which occurs elsewhere.
