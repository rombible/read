Wherefore is it so? This is the day of God's patience; and, in some way or other, he makes use of the prosperity of the wicked to serve his own counsels, while it ripens them for ruin; but the chief reason is, because he will make it appear there is another world. These prospering sinners make light of God and religion, as if because they have so much of this world, they had no need to look after another. But religion is not a vain thing.

The idea is, that when they die they are not afflicted with lingering disease, and great bodily pain, but having lived to an old age in the midst of comforts, they drop off suddenly and quietly, and sleep in the grave. God gives them prosperity while they live, and when they come to die he does not come forth with the severe expressions of his displeasure, and oppress them with long and lingering sickness. The author of <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/73.htm">Psalm 73</a> had a view of the death of the wicked remarkably similar to this, when he said,<p>For I was envious at the foolish,<p>When I saw the prosperity of the wicked.<p>For there are no bands in their death,<p>But their strength is firm. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/73-3.htm">Psalm 73:3-4</a>.<p>All that Job says here is predicated on the supposition that such a sudden removal is preferable to death accompanied with long and lingering illness. The idea is, that it is in itself "desirable" to live in tranquility; to reach an honorable old age surrounded by children and friends, and then quietly and suddenly to drop into the grave without being a burden to friends. The wicked, he says, often live such a life, and he infers, therefore, that it is not a fact that God deals with people according to their character in this life, and that it is not right to draw an inference respecting their moral character from his dealings with them in this world. There are instances enough occurring in every age like those supposed here by Job, to justify the conclusion which he draws. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. wealth&#8212;Old English Version for "prosperity."<p>in a moment&#8212;not by a lingering disease.

Or "in good" (p); not in the performance of good works, or in the exercise of that which is spiritually good; or in seeking after spiritual good things, or eternal happiness; but in earthly good, in the enjoyment of the temporal good things of this life, and which to enjoy in a moderate and becoming manner is not criminal, but commendable; but these men, and such as they, seek no other good but worldly good; their language is, "who will show us any good?" <a href="/psalms/4-6.htm">Psalm 4:6</a>; any outward good; the way to get it, how to come at it, and be put in the possession of it: such place all their happiness in such sort of good, and spend all their time either in getting it, or in enjoying it, and in nothing else; not in spiritual exercises, in prayer, or praise, in their own houses, in private; nor in an attendance on the worship of God in public; it denotes also their continuance in prosperity unto the end of their days; for there is a various reading; we follow the Keri or margin, but the "Cetib", or writing, is, "they become old" (q); in wealth, or good things, and which is followed by many; they live all their days in the midst of wealth and riches, and die in such circumstances, contrary to what Zophar had asserted in <a href="/job/20-5.htm">Job 20:5</a>; <p>and in a moment go down to the grave; the house appointed for all living, man's long home, into which he is said to go down, because let down and interred in the earth; hither wicked men must come, after all their wealth, riches, prosperity, and pleasure; and hither they descend "in a moment"; suddenly, no previous change being made in their outward circumstances; and without any presage or forenotice of it, without any lingering disease and sickness leading on to it, there being no bands in their death, nothing to hinder and restrain from dying; but they drop at once into the grave, without sickness or pain: or "in rest", or "quietly" (r); being wholly at ease and quiet, as in <a href="/job/21-23.htm">Job 21:23</a>; not only free from acute pains and grievous distempers, as burning fevers, and violent tortures, and racks of the stone, and other distressing disorders; but without any distress of mind, ignorant of their state and condition, and unconcerned about it; as they are at ease from their youth, and settled on their lees, they remain so, and go out of the world in like manner; and as sheep are laid in the grave, die senseless and stupid, having no thought in their last moments what will become of them in another world: some render it, "they go down to hell" (s); the state and place of the wicked after death; which, though true, seems not so agreeable to Job's scope and design, which is not to describe the punishment of the wicked, but their easy circumstances in life and in death; and so the Jewish commentators generally understand it. Aben Ezra's note is, <p>"in a moment, without afflictions;'' <p>Jarchi, <p>"quietly, without chastisements;'' <p>and Bar Tzemach, <p>"without evil diseases;'' <p>having nothing to distress them in body or mind, when many a good man lies long on a bed of languishing, tortured with diseases, chastened with sore pain, and his life gradually draws near to the grave, and to the destroyers. <p>(p) "in bono", Pagninus, Montanus, Junius &amp; Tremellius, &amp;c.

Since &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1512;&#1493; and &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;&#1493; are interchangeable, and are construed according to their genus, the former undoubtedly is intended of the male, not also epikoi'noos of the female (lxx &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c2;, Jerome, Saadia), as Rosenm., after Bochart, believes it must be taken, because `br is never said de mare feminam ineunte, but always de femina quae concipit. In reality, however, it is with &#1506;&#1489;&#1512; otherwise than with &#1506;&#1491;&#1492;, whose Pael and Aphel certainly signify concipere (prop. transmittere sc. semen in a passive sense). On the other hand, &#1506;&#1489;&#1512;, even in Kal, signifies to be impregnated (whence &#1506;&#1493;&#1489;&#1512;, the embryo, and the biblical &#1488;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, like the extra-biblical &#1506;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, the produce of the land), the Pael consequently to impregnate, whence &#1502;&#1506;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488; (from the part. pass. &#1502;&#1506;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;) impregnated (pregnant), the Ithpa. to be impregnated, as Rabb. Pual &#1502;&#1506;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;, impregnated (by which &#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1514; also signifies pregnant, which would be hardly possible if &#1506;&#1489;&#1512; in this sexual sense were not radically distinct from &#1506;&#1489;&#1512;, &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;-&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3bd;). Accordingly the Targ. translates &#1506;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; by &#1502;&#1489;&#1496;&#1497;&#1503; (impraegnans), and Gecatilia translates &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1512;&#1493; by Arab. fh&#803;lhm (admissarius eorum), after which nearly all Jewish expositors explain. This explanation also suits &#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1490;&#1506;&#1500;, which lxx translates &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3bf;&#x3bf;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5; (Jer. non abortivit), Symm. in a like sense &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;, Aq. &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;, Saad. la julziq. The reference of &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1512;&#1493; to the female animal everywhere assumed is incorrect; on the contrary, the bullock kept for breeding is the subject; but proceeding from this, that which is affirmed is certainly referred to the female animal. For &#1490;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500; signifies to cast out, cast away; the Hiph. therefore: to cause to cast out; Rabb. in the specified signification: so to heat what has sucked in that which is unclean, that it gives it back or lets it go (&#1500;&#1508;&#1500;&#1493;&#1496; &#1492;&#1489;&#1500;&#1493;&#1506;). Accordingly Raschi explains: "he injects not useless seed into her, which might come back and be again separated (&#1504;&#1508;&#1500;&#1496;) from her inward part, without impregnation taking place." What therefore &#1506;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; says positively, &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1490;&#1506;&#1497;&#1500; says negatively: neque efficit ut ejiciat.<p>(Note: The Aruch under &#1490;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;, quotes a passage of the Tosefta: &#1502;&#1493;&#1494;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; &#1492;&#1497;&#1508;&#1492; &#1514;&#1488;&#1499;&#1500;&#1501; &#1490;&#1497;&#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1497; &#1489;&#1497;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501; &#1502;&#1493;&#1514;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1489;&#1488;&#1499;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492;, the cast away (Wrflinge) eggs (i.e., such as have fallen away from the hen from a stroke on the tail of some other cause, and which are not completely formed) are allowed as food; he may eat them who does not loathe them.)<p>It is then further, in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/21-9.htm">Job 21:9</a>, said of the female animal which has been impregnated that she does not allow it to glide away, i.e., the fruit, therefore that she brings forth (&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1496; as &#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1496;, &#1492;&#1502;&#1500;&#1497;&#1496;), and that she does not cause or suffer any untimely birth.<p>continued...</body></html>
