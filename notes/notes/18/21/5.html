Job is about to controvert Zophar's theory of the certain retribution that overtakes the wicked man in this life, and to maintain that, on the contrary, he usually prospers (vers. 7-18). Knowing that, in thus running counter to the general religious teaching, he will arouse much horror and indignation on the part of those who hear him, he prefaces his remarks with a notice that they will cause astonishment, and an acknowledgment that he himself cannot reflect upon the subject without a feeling of alarm and dismay. He thus hopes partially to disarm his opponents. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Mark me</span>; literally, <span class="accented">look to me</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "attend to me," <span class="cmt_word">for I am about to say something well worth attention</span>. <span class="cmt_word">And be astonished.

Harpocrates, the Egyptian god of silence, was often represented with his finger on his lips (see the author's 'History of Ancient Egypt,' vol. 1. p. 362). The symbolism is almost universal.

Ges. 147, rem. 1. Certainly the relative clause &#1500;&#1488; &#1504;&#1508;&#1495; may also be explained by supplying &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468;: into which one has not blown, or that one has not blown on (Symm., Theod., &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5; &#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;): both renderings are possible, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-20.htm">Ezekiel 22:20</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/22-22.htm">Ezekiel 22:22</a>; but since the masc. &#1497;&#1512;&#1506; follows, having undoubtedly &#1488;&#1513;&#1473; as its subject, we can unhesitatingly take the Synallage gen. as beginning even with &#1504;&#1508;&#1495;.

The correct interpretation has been brought forward by Schultens.<p>It is not without reference to <a href="//biblehub.com/job/16-18.htm">Job 16:18-19</a>, where Job has called upon earth and heaven as witnesses, that in <a href="/job/20-27.htm">Job 20:27</a> Zophar continues: "the heavens reveal his guilt, and the earth rises against him;" heaven and earth bear witness to his being an abhorrence, not worthy of being borne by the earth and shone upon by the light of heaven; they testify this, since their powers from below and above vie with one another to get rid of him. &#1502;&#1514;&#1511;&#1493;&#1502;&#1502;&#1492; is connected closely with &#1500;&#1493; (which has Lamed raphatum) by means of Mercha-Zinnorith, and under the influence of the law, according to which before a monosyllabic accented word the tone is drawn back from the last syllable of the preceding word to the penultima (Ew. 73, 3), is accented as Milel on account of the pause.<p>continued...</body></html>
