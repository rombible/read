Turn to whom you will, you will find that the punishment of sinners is designed more for the other world than for this, Jude 1:14,15. The sinner is here supposed to live in a great deal of power. The sinner shall have a splendid funeral: a poor thing for any man to be proud of the prospect of. He shall have a stately monument. And a valley with springs of water to keep the turf green, was accounted an honourable burial place among eastern people; but such things are vain distinctions. Death closes his prosperity. It is but a poor encouragement to die, that others have died before us. That which makes a man die with true courage, is, with faith to remember that Jesus Christ died and was laid in the grave, not only before us, but for us. That He hath gone before us, and died for us, who is alive and liveth for us, is true consolation in the hour of death.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For ye say, Where is the house of the prince? - That is, you maintain that the house of the wicked man, in a high station, will be certainly over thrown. The parallelism, as well as the whole connection, requires us to understand the word "prince" here as referring to a "wicked" ruler. The word used (&#1504;&#1491;&#1497;&#1489;  na&#770;d&#305;&#770;yb) properly means, one willing, voluntary, prompt; then, one who is liberal, generous, noble; then, one of noble birth, or of elevated rank; and then, as princes often had that character, it is used in a bad sense, and means a "tyrant." See <a href="/isaiah/13-2.htm">Isaiah 13:2</a>.<p>And where are the dwelling places of the wicked - Margin, "tent of the tabernacles." The Hebrew is, "The tent of the dwelling places." The dwelling place was usually a "tent." The meaning is, that such dwelling places would be certainly destroyed, as an expression of the divine displeasure. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>28. ye say&#8212;referring to Zophar (Job 20:7).<p>the house&#8212;referring to the fall of the house of Job's oldest son (Job 1:19) and the destruction of his family.<p>prince&#8212;The parallel "wicked" in the second clause requires this to be taken in a bad sense, tyrant, oppressor (Isa 13:2), the same Hebrew, "nobles"&#8212;oppressors.<p>dwelling-places&#8212;rather, "pavilions," a tent containing many dwellings, such as a great emir, like Job, with many dependents, would have.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/job/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Ye say, </span> to wit, in your minds. <span class="ital">Where is the house of the prince</span>? i.e. it is no where, it is lost and gone.

Since they maintain that necessarily and constantly virtue is rewarded by prosperity, and sin by misfortune, but without this law of the divine order of the world which is maintained by them being supported by experience: if they set themselves up as teachers of God, they will teach Him the right understanding of the conduct which is to be followed by Him as a ruler and judge of men, while nevertheless He is the Absolute One, beneath whose judicial rule not merely man, but also the heavenly spirits, are placed, and to which they must conform and bow. The verb &#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1491;, instead of being construed with two acc., as in the dependent passage <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/40-14.htm">Isaiah 40:14</a>, is here construed with the dat. of the person (which is not to be judged according to <a href="/job/5-2.htm">Job 5:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/19-3.htm">Job 19:3</a>, but according to &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769; &#x3c4;&#x3b9;, to teach one anything, beside the other prevailing construction). With &#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1488; a circumstantial clause begins regularly: while He, however, etc. Arnh. and Lwenth. translate: while, however, He exaltedly judges, i.e., according to a law that infinitely transcends man; but that must have been &#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1501; (and even thus it would still be liable to be misunderstood). Hahn (whom Olsh. is inclined to support): but He will judge the proud, to which first the circumstantial clause, and secondly the parallels, <a href="/job/35-2.htm">Job 35:2</a>; <a href="/job/15-15.htm">Job 15:15</a>; <a href="/job/4-18.htm">Job 4:18</a> (comp. <a href="/isaiah/24-21.htm">Isaiah 24:21</a>), from which it is evident that &#1512;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; signifies the heavenly beings (as <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/78-69.htm">Psalm 78:69</a>, the heights of heaven), are opposed: it is a fundamental thought of this book, which abounds in allusions to the angels, that the angels, although exalted above men, are nevertheless in contrast with God imperfect, and therefore are removed neither from the possibility of sin nor the necessity of a government which holds them together in unity, and exercises a judicial authority over them. The rule of the all-exalted Judge is different from that which the three presumptuously prescribe to Him.<p>The one (viz., the evil-doer) dies &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1510;&#1501; &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;, in ipsa sua integritate, like &#1489;&#1506;&#1510;&#1501; &#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1501;, ipso illo die; the Arabic would be f&#305;&#770; &#8219;yn, since there the eye, here the bone (comp.

As to the form, however (which Rd. and Olsh. consider to be an error in writing), it is either a mixed form from &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1504;&#1503; and &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493; with the blended meaning of both (Ew. 106, c), to which the comparison with &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; ( equals  &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;) is not altogether suitable, or it is formed from &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1504;&#1503; by means of an epenthesis (as &#1494;&#1500;&#1506;&#1507; from &#1494;&#1506;&#1507;, aestuare, and &#1489;&#1500;&#1505;&#1501;, &#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, from &#1489;&#1513;&#1474;&#1501;), and of similar but intensified signification; we prefer the latter, without however denying the real existence of such mixed forms (vid., on <a href="/job/26-9.htm">Job 26:9</a>; <a href="/job/33-25.htm">Job 33:25</a>). This fulness of health and prosperity is depicted in <a href="/job/21-24.htm">Job 21:24</a>.
