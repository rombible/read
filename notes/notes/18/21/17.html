He reconciles this to the holiness and justice of God. Even while they prosper thus, they are light and worthless, of no account with God, or with wise men. In the height of their pomp and power, there is but a step between them and ruin. Job refers the difference Providence makes between one wicked man and another, into the wisdom of God. He is Judge of all the earth, and he will do right. So vast is the disproportion between time and eternity, that if hell be the lot of every sinner at last, it makes little difference if one goes singing thither, and another sighing. If one wicked man die in a palace, and another in a dungeon, the worm that dies not, and the fire that is not quenched, will be the same to them. Thus differences in this world are not worth perplexing ourselves about.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>How oft is the candle of the wicked put out? - Margin, "lamp." A light, or a lamp, was an image of prosperity. There is, probably, an allusion here to what had been maintained by Bildad, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/18-5.htm">Job 18:5-6</a>, that the light of the wicked would be extinguished, and their dwellings made dark; see the notes at those verses. Job replies to this by asking how often it occurred. He inquires whether it was a frequent thing. By this, he implies that it was not universal; that it was a less frequent occurrence than they supposed. The meaning is, "How often does it, in fact, happen that the light of the wicked is extinguished, and that God distributes sorrows among them in his anger? Much less frequently than you suppose, for he bestows upon many of them tokens of abundant prosperity." In this manner, by an appeal to "fact" and "observation," Job aims to convince them that their position was wrong, and that it was not true that the wicked were invariably overwhelmed with calamity, as they had maintained.<p>God distributeth sorrows - The word "God" here, is understood, but there can be no doubt that it is correct. Job means to ask, how often it was true in fact that God "apportioned" the sorrows which he sent on men in accordance with their character. How often, in fact, did he treat the wicked as they deserved, and overwhelm them with calamity. It was not true that he did it, by any means, as often as they maintained, or so as to make it a certain rule in judging of character. <p><a href="//biblehub.com/job/21-17.htm">Job 21:17-18</a><a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17. Job in this whole passage down to Job 21:21 quotes the assertion of the friends, as to the short continuance of the sinner's prosperity, not his own sentiments. In Job 21:22 he proceeds to refute them. "How oft is the candle" (lamp), &c., quoting Bildad's sentiment (Job 18:5, 6), in order to question its truth (compare Mt 25:8).<p>how oft&#8212;"God distributeth," &c.

Job here returns, as Jarchi observes, to his former account of the constant and continued prosperity of wicked men; and puts questions tending to prove the same. Bildad had said, that the light and candle of the wicked would be put out, <a href="/job/18-5.htm">Job 18:5</a>. Job, referring to this, asks how often this is the case; meaning, by the candle of the wicked, not his soul or spirit, which cannot be put out, or become extinct, as to be no more; nor the light of nature in his soul, though that may be put out in a great measure, and he be given up to judicial blindness and hardness of heart; but either his natural life, which, like a candle, burns for a while, and then becomes extinct, or rather his outward prosperity and happiness: if the question relates to the former, to the natural life of wicked men, it is not whether they die, that is no question; all die, good and bad; but whether they die in common sooner than others, or whether the instances of the brevity of the life of wicked men were frequent, or but seldom; or, is this always the case? it is not, it is rare, and not common; they live as long as other men, and oftentimes longer; they live and become old, as Job before observes; they prolong their days in their wickedness; or, if this refers to the latter, the prosperity of the wicked, the question is, is that for the most part a short lived prosperity? it is not, it is but rarely so; wicked men generally spend all their days in wealth, as before observed; so Ramban interprets "how oft", that is, how seldom; and to the same sense Mr. Broughton, <p>"not so often is the candle of the wicked put out;'' <p>and how oft cometh their destruction upon them? not eternal, but temporal destruction, calamities and distresses; these are threatened them, but they are not executed on them immediately; and therefore their hearts are set in them to do evil: generally speaking, they have their good things here; they are filled with hidden treasure, which they enjoy while they live, and leave the rest of their substance to their babes; they are not destroyed on every side, as Job was; their substance, their cattle, their servants, their children, and their own health. Job asks how often this is their case, as had been his; and his sense is, and what experience testifies, it is but rarely the, case of wicked men; he seems to refer to what is said, <a href="/job/18-12.htm">Job 18:12</a>. <p>God distributeth sorrows in his anger; or rather, "how oft doth he distribute sorrows in his anger?" but seldom; he is angry with the wicked every day, and reserves wrath for them, and many sorrows shall be to them, but not for the present; those are future, and even such as of a woman in travail, as the word used signifies, and which shall come upon them suddenly and certainly, and there will be no avoiding them; see <a href="/psalms/32-10.htm">Psalm 32:10</a>; but does God frequently distribute or portion out sorrows to them now? he does not; they have their portion of good things in this life; does he usually give them sorrow of heart, his curse unto them? he does not; it is very seldom he does; they are not in trouble, nor plagued as other men; they are not men of sorrows and acquainted with griefs; they are generally strangers to them, and live merrily all their days, <a href="/job/21-12.htm">Job 21:12</a>; respect seems to be had to the conclusion of Zophar's speech, <a href="/job/20-29.htm">Job 20:29</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/21.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">How oft is the candle of the wicked put out! and how oft cometh their destruction upon them!

Is not the signal downfall of the wicked  prosperous man a comparatively rare occur-fence? How oft cometh their destruction upon them*. When the problem here propounded came before Asaph, he seems to have solved it by the supposition that in all cases retribution visited the wicked in this life, and that they were cast down from their prosperity. "I went," he says, "into the sanctuary of God; then understood I the end of these men. Surely thou didst set them in slippery places; thou castedst them down into destruction. How are they brought into desolation, as in a moment! They are utterly consumed with terrors. As a dream when one awaketh; so, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou shalt despise their image" (<a href="/psalms/73-17.htm">Psalm 73:17-20</a>). Job maintains that such a catastrophe happens but seldom, and that for the most part the wicked go down to the grave in peace. God distributeth sorrows in his anger. This is hot an independent clause. The sense runs on: <span class="accented">How off is it that the candle of the wicked is put out</span> <span class="accented">and that destruction cometh upon them</span> <span class="accented">and God showers sorrows upon them in his anger</span>?

It is the antithesis of Zophar's thesis, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/20-5.htm">Job 20:5</a>, and seeks the reason of the fact established by experience which had also well-nigh proved the ruin of Asaph (<a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/73.htm">Psalm 73</a>:comp. <a href="//biblehub.com/malachi/3-13.htm">Malachi 3:13-15</a>), viz., that the ungodly, far from being overtaken by the punishment of their godlessness, continued in the enjoyment of life, that they attain to old age, and also a proportionately increasing power and wealth.

Accordingly the Targ. translates &#1506;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; by &#1502;&#1489;&#1496;&#1497;&#1503; (impraegnans), and Gecatilia translates &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1512;&#1493; by Arab. fh&#803;lhm (admissarius eorum), after which nearly all Jewish expositors explain. This explanation also suits &#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1490;&#1506;&#1500;, which lxx translates &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3bf;&#x3bf;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5; (Jer. non abortivit), Symm. in a like sense &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;, Aq. &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;, Saad. la julziq. The reference of &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1512;&#1493; to the female animal everywhere assumed is incorrect; on the contrary, the bullock kept for breeding is the subject; but proceeding from this, that which is affirmed is certainly referred to the female animal. For &#1490;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500; signifies to cast out, cast away; the Hiph. therefore: to cause to cast out; Rabb. in the specified signification: so to heat what has sucked in that which is unclean, that it gives it back or lets it go (&#1500;&#1508;&#1500;&#1493;&#1496; &#1492;&#1489;&#1500;&#1493;&#1506;). Accordingly Raschi explains: "he injects not useless seed into her, which might come back and be again separated (&#1504;&#1508;&#1500;&#1496;) from her inward part, without impregnation taking place." What therefore &#1506;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; says positively, &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1490;&#1506;&#1497;&#1500; says negatively: neque efficit ut ejiciat.<p>(Note: The Aruch under &#1490;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;, quotes a passage of the Tosefta: &#1502;&#1493;&#1494;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; &#1492;&#1497;&#1508;&#1492; &#1514;&#1488;&#1499;&#1500;&#1501; &#1490;&#1497;&#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1497; &#1489;&#1497;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501; &#1502;&#1493;&#1514;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1489;&#1488;&#1499;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492;, the cast away (Wrflinge) eggs (i.e., such as have fallen away from the hen from a stroke on the tail of some other cause, and which are not completely formed) are allowed as food; he may eat them who does not loathe them.)<p>It is then further, in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/21-9.htm">Job 21:9</a>, said of the female animal which has been impregnated that she does not allow it to glide away, i.e., the fruit, therefore that she brings forth (&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1496; as &#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1496;, &#1492;&#1502;&#1500;&#1497;&#1496;), and that she does not cause or suffer any untimely birth.<p>continued...</body></html>
