Here it means preparation, equipment - that is, anything put in order, or ready, <a href="/judges/17-10.htm">Judges 17:10</a>. It is also used in the sense of estimation or valuation, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/5-15.htm">Leviticus 5:15</a>, <a href="/leviticus/5-18.htm">Leviticus 5:18</a>. The word "price" here, however, seems to form no proper answer to the question in the previous verse, as the question is, "where" wisdom is to be found, not what is its "value." Many expositors have, therefore, introduced a different idea in their interpretation. Dr. Good renders it, "Man knoweth not its source." Prof. Lee, "Man knoweth not its equal." Herder, "Man knoweth not the seat thereof." Coverdale, "No man can tell how worthy a thing she is." The Septuagint renders it, "Man knoweth not - &#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2;  hodon aute&#772;s - her way." But the word used here is not employed to denote a "place" or "way," and the true interpretation doubtless is, that Job does not confine himself to a strict answer of the question proposed in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/28-12.htm">Job 28:12</a>, but goes on to say that man could not buy it; he could neither find it, nor had he the means of purchasing it with all the wealth of which he was the owner.<p>Neither is it found in the land of the living - That is, it is not found among human beings. We must look to a higher source than man for true wisdom; compare <a href="/isaiah/38-11.htm">Isaiah 38:11</a>; <a href="/isaiah/53-8.htm">Isaiah 53:8</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/28.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13.

The worth and value of it, what price to set upon it, or offer and give for it; nor does he know where to find an equivalent to it, or what is a valuable consideration for it: as for the wisdom of God in his dealings with men, if a man was to give all the substance of his house to know the secret reasons of them, it would utterly be condemned; yea, if he had all the riches in the world in his possession, and would offer them on that consideration, he would not be able to attain the knowledge of them: or "the order thereof" (o); the order of divine Providence, the wise disposal of thing, and the reasons thereof. In the first sense it is applicable to all the things before mentioned; to spiritual wisdom in men, supernatural grace, experimental religion, and real godliness; the worth of which is not known by carnal men, they despise it, and scoff at it; and to the Gospel, which is reckoned foolishness by them, and is of no account; and so is Christ himself rejected and disallowed of men, though chosen of God, and precious both to him and them that believe, who only know the price and value of him: <p>neither is it found in the land of the living; meaning not wisdom, though that in every sense is not from below, or earthly, but from above, and heavenly, but the price of it; and the sense is, that there is nothing in the whole globe that is equal to its worth, or can be proposed as a valuable consideration for it. <p>(o) "ordinem ejus", Montanus, Bolducius. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/28.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Man knoweth not <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> the price thereof; neither is it found in the land of the living.</span><p>(i) It is too high a thing for man to attain to in this world.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/job/28.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">13</span>. <span class="ital">the price thereof</span>] For “price” the Sept. read <span class="ital">way</span>—man knoweth not the way thereof (cf. <span class="ital"><a href="/job/28-23.htm" title="God understands the way thereof, and he knows the place thereof.">Job 28:23</a></span>), i. e. the <span class="ital">way to it</span>, and very many commentators adopt this reading, which gives a more direct answer to the question in <span class="ital"><a href="/job/28-12.htm" title="But where shall wisdom be found? and where is the place of understanding?">Job 28:12</a></span>.

They are two grammatically independent predicates, the first of which is only the foil of the other: the earth, out of it cometh forth bread (&#1500;&#1495;&#1501; as <a href="/psalms/104-14.htm">Psalm 104:14</a>), and beneath it (the surface of the earth)  equals  that which lies beneath it (&#1493;&#1514;&#1495;&#1514;&#1497;&#1492; only virtually a subj. in the sense of &#1493;&#1514;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1492;, since &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; occurs only as a preposition), is turned about (comp. the construction of the sing. of the verb with the plur. subj. <a href="/job/30-15.htm">Job 30:15</a>) as (by) fire Instar ignis, scil. subvertentis); i.e., the earth above furnishes nourishment to man, but that not satisfying him, he also digs out its inward parts (comp. Pliny, h. n. xxxiii. proaem.: in sede Manium opes quaerimus, tanquam parum benigna fertilique quaqua calcatur), since this is turned or tossed about (comp. &#1502;&#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1499;&#1492;, the special word for the overthrow of Sodom by fire) by mining work, as when fire breaks out in a house, or even as when a volcanic fire rumbles within a mountain (Castalio: agunt per magna spatia cuniculos et terram subeunt non secus ac ignis facet ut in Aetna et Vesuvio). The reading &#1489;&#1502;&#1493; (Schlottm.) instead of &#1499;&#1502;&#1493; is natural, since fire is really used to blast the rock, and to separate the ore from the stone; but, with the exception of Jerome, who has arbitrarily altered the text (terra, de qua oriebatur panis in loco suo, igni subversa est), all the old translations reproduce &#1499;&#1502;&#1493;, which even Nasse, in opposition to von Veltheim, thinks suitable: Man's restless search, which rummages everything through, is compared to the unrestrainable ravaging fire.<p><a href="/job/28-6.htm">Job 28:6</a> also consists of two grammatically independent assertions: the place (bed) of the sapphire is its rock. Must we refer &#1500;&#1493; to &#1505;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;, and translate: "and it contains fine dust of gold" (Hirz., Umbr., Stick., Nasse)? It is possible, for Theophrastus (p. 692, ed. Schneider) says of the sapphire it is &#x3c9;&#788;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1; &#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, as it were covered with gold dust or grains of gold; and Pliny, h. n. xxxvii. 9, 38f.: Inest ei (cyano) aliquando et aureus pulvis qualis in sapphiris, in iis enim aurum punctis conlucet, which nevertheless does not hold good of the proper sapphire, but of the azure stone (lapis lazuli) which is confounded with it, a variegated species of which, with gold, or rather with iron pyrites glittering like gold, is specially valued.<p>(Note: Comp. Quenstedt, Handbuch der Mineralogie (1863), S. 355 and 302.)<p>But Schultens rightly observes: vix cerdiderim, illum auratilem pulvisculum sapphiri peculiari mentione dignum; and Schlottm.: such a collateral definition to &#1505;&#1508;&#1497;&#1512;, expressed in a special clause (not a relative one), has something awkward about it. On the other hand, &#1506;&#1508;&#1512;&#1514; &#1494;&#1492;&#1489; is a perfectly suitable appellation of gold ore. "The earth, which is in itself black," says Diodorus in the passage quoted before, "is interspersed with veins of marble, which is of such pre-eminent whiteness, that its brilliance surpasses everything that glitters, and from it the overseers of the mine prepare gold with a large number of workmen." And further on, of the heating of this gold ore he says: "the hardest auriferous earth they burn thoroughly in a large fire; thus they make it soft, so that it can be worked by the hand." &#1506;&#1508;&#1512;&#1514; &#1494;&#1492;&#1489; is a still more suitable expression for such auriferous earth and ore than for the nuggets of &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; (i.e., unsmelted) of the size of a chestnut, which, according to Diodorus, ii. 50, are obtained in mines in Arabia (&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;). But it is inadmissible to refer &#1500;&#1493; to man, for the clause would then require to be translated: and gold ore is to him  equals  he has, while it is the rather intended to be said that the interior of the earth has gold ore. &#1500;&#1493; is therefore, with Hahn and Schlottm., to be referred to &#1502;&#1511;&#1493;&#1501;: and this place of the sapphire, it contains gold. The poet might have written &#1500;&#1492;&#1468; but &#1500;&#1493; implies that where the sapphire is found, gold is also found. The following &#1504;&#1514;&#1497;&#1489; (with Dech), together with the following relative clause, is connected with &#1488;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492;, or even with &#1502;&#1511;&#1493;&#1501;, which through <a href="/job/28-6.htm">Job 28:6</a> is become the chief subj.: the place of the sapphire and of the gold is the rock of the bowels of the earth, - a way, which, etc., i.e., such a place is the interior of the earth, accessible to no living being of the earth's surface except to man alone. The sight of the bird of prey, the &#1506;&#1497;&#1496;, &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;, and of the &#1488;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, i.e., the hawk or kite, reaches from above far and wide beneath;<p>(Note: The &#1488;&#1497;&#1492; - says the Talmud b.
