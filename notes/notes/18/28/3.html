To confirm this, he showed of what a great deal of knowledge and wealth men may make themselves masters. The caverns of the earth may be discovered, but not the counsels of Heaven. Go to the miners, thou sluggard in religion, consider their ways, and be wise. Let their courage and diligence in seeking the wealth that perishes, shame us out of slothfulness and faint-heartedness in labouring for the true riches. How much better is it to get wisdom than gold! How much easier, and safer! Yet gold is sought for, but grace neglected. Will the hopes of precious things out of the earth, so men call them, though really they are paltry and perishing, be such a spur to industry, and shall not the certain prospect of truly precious things in heaven be much more so?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He setteth an end to darkness - That is, man does. The reference here is undoubtedly to the operations of mining, and the idea is, that man delves into the darkest regions; he goes even to the outer limits of darkness; he penetrates everywhere. Probably the allusion is derived from the custom of carrying torches into mines.<p>And searcheth out all perfection - Makes a complete search; examines everything; carries the matter to the utmost. The idea is not that he searches out all perfection - as our translation would seem to convey; but that he makes a complete and thorough search - and yet after all he does not come to the true and highest wisdom.<p>The stones of darkness - The last stone, says Herder, in the mining investigations in the time of Job; the corner or boundary stone, as it were, of the kingdom of darkness and night. Prof. Lee supposes that there is allusion here to the fact that stones were used as "weights," and that the idea is, that man had ascertained the "exact weight" of the gross darkness, that is, had taken an accurate admeasurement of it, or had wholly investigated it. But this solution seems far-fetched. Schultens supposes the center of the earth to be denoted by this expression. But it seems to me that the words "stone" and "darkness" are to be separated, and that the one is not used to qualify the other. The sense is, that man searches out everything; he perfectly and accurately penetrates everywhere, and examines all objects; "the stone" (&#1488;&#1489;&#1503;  'eben), that is, the rocks, the mines; "the darkness" (&#1488;&#1508;&#1500;  'o&#770;phel), that is, the darkness of the cavern, the interior of the earth; "and the shadow of death" (&#1510;&#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;  tsalma&#770;veth), that is, the most dark and impenetrable regions of the earth.

Bttcher's translation, "He lieth down rich and cannot be displaced," gives the words a meaning that is ridiculed by the usage of the language. On the other hand, &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1488;&#1505;&#1507; can signify: and he is not conveyed away (comp. e.g., <a href="/jeremiah/8-2.htm">Jeremiah 8:2</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/29-5.htm">Ezekiel 29:5</a>; but not <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/57-1.htm">Isaiah 57:1</a>, where it signifies to be swept away, and also not <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/20-26.htm">Numbers 20:26</a>, where it signifies to be gathered to the fathers), and is probably intended to be explained after the pointing that we have, as Rosenm. and even Ralbag explain it: "he is not conveyed away; one opens his eyes and he is not;" or even as Schlottm.: "he is not conveyed away; in one moment he still looks about him, in the next he is no more;" but the relation of the two parts of the verse in this interpretation is unsatisfactory, and the preceding strophe has already referred to his not being buried. Since, therefore, only an unsuitable, and what is more, a badly-expressed thought, is gained by this reading, it may be that the expression should be regarded with Hahn as interrogative: is he not swept away? This, however, is only a makeshift, and therefore we must see whether it may not perhaps be susceptible of another pointing. Jerome transl.: dives cum dormierit, nihil secum auferet; the thought is not bad, but &#1502;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492; is wanting, and &#1500;&#1488; alone does not signify nihil.

This translation follows the form of reading &#1497;&#1488;&#1505;&#1507;  equals  &#1497;&#1493;&#1505;&#1497;&#1507;, gives a suitable sense, places both parts of the verse in the right relation, and accords with the style of the poet (vid., <a href="/job/20-9.htm">Job 20:9</a>; <a href="/job/40-5.htm">Job 40:5</a>); and accordingly, with Ew., Hirz., and Hlgst., we decide in favour of this reading: he lieth down to sleep rich, and he doeth it no more, since in the night he is removed from life and also from riches by sudden death; or also: in the morning he openeth his eyes without imagining it is the last time, for, overwhelmed by sudden death, he closes them for ever. <a href="/job/27-20.htm">Job 27:20</a> and <a href="/job/27-20.htm">Job 27:20</a> are attached crosswise (chiastisch) to this picture of sudden destruction, be it by night or by day: the terrors of death seize him (sing. fem. with a plur. subj. following it, according to Ges. 146, 3) like a flood (comp. the floods of Belial, <a href="/psalms/18-5.htm">Psalm 18:5</a>), by night a whirlwind (&#1490;&#1468;&#1504;&#1489;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; &#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1492;, as <a href="/job/21-18.htm">Job 21:18</a>) carrieth him away. The Syriac and Arabic versions add, as a sort of interpolation: as a fluttering (large white) night-moth, - an addition which no one can consider beautiful.<p><a href="/job/27-21.htm">Job 27:21</a> extends the figure of the whirlwind. In Hebrew, even when the narrative has reference to Egyptian matters (<a href="/genesis/41-23.htm">Genesis 41:23</a>), the &#1511;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; which comes from the Arabian desert is the destructive, devastating, and parching wind &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4; &#787; &#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd;.<p>(Note: In Syria and Arabia the east wind is no longer called qad&#305;&#770;m, but exclusively sharq&#305;&#770;ja, i.e., the wind that blows from the rising of the sun (sharq). This wind rarely prevails in summer, occurring then only two or three days a month on an average; it is more frequent in the winter and early spring, when, if it continues long, the tender vegetation is parched up, and a year of famine follows, whence in the Lebanon it is called semu&#770;m (&#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;), which in the present day denotes the "poisonous wind" ( equals  nesme musimme), but originally, by alliance with the Hebr. &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1501;, denoted the "devastating wind." The east wind is dry; it excites the blood, contracts the chest, causes restlessness and anxiety, and sleepless nights or evil dreams. Both man and beast feel weak and sickly while it prevails. Hence that which is unpleasant and revolting in life is compared to the east wind. Thus a maid in Hauran, at the sight of one of my Damascus travelling companions, whose excessive ugliness struck her, cried: billa&#770;h, naha&#770;r el-jo&#770;m aqshar (Arab. 'qs&#780;r), wagahetni (Arab. w-jht&#775;n&#305;&#770;) sharq&#305;&#770;ja, "by God, it is an unhealthy day to-day: an east wind blew upon me." And in a festive dance song of the Merg district, these words occur:<p>wa rudd l&#305;&#770; ho&#770;met hode&#770;nik<p>continued...</body></html>
