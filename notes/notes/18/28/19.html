Its worth is infinitely more than all the riches in this world. It is a gift of the Holy Ghost which cannot be bought with money. Let that which is most precious in God's account, be so in ours. Job asks after it as one that truly desired to find it, and despaired of finding it any where but in God; any way but by Divine revelation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The topaz - The topaz is a precious stone, whose colors are yellow, green, blue, and red. Its natural place is in various primitive rocks, such as the topaz-rock, gneiss, and clay-slate. It is found in the granite and gneiss districts of Mar and Cairnaorta, in Cornwall, in Brazil, and in various other places. The most valuable stones of this kind now known are those which are found in Brazil. This gem is much prized by jewelers, and is considered as one of the more beautiful ornamental stones. The Hebrew word &#1508;&#1496;&#1491;&#1492;  p&#305;&#770;t&#803;da&#770;h, occurs in <a href="/exodus/28-17.htm">Exodus 28:17</a>; <a href="/exodus/39-10.htm">Exodus 39:10</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/28-13.htm">Ezekiel 28:13</a>. and in this place only. It is uniformly rendered topaz. It is not improbable that the English word "topaz," and the Greek &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  topazion, are derived from this, by a slight transposition of the letters - &#1496;&#1508;&#1491;&#1492;. The Vulgate and the Septuagint render this "topaz."<p>Of Ethiopia - Hebrew &#1499;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;  ku&#770;sh - "Cush." Coverdale here renders it, "India." On the meaning of this word, and the region denoted by it, see the notes at <a href="/isaiah/11-11.htm">Isaiah 11:11</a>. It may mean either the part of Africa now known as Ethiopia, or Abyssinia and Nubia; the southern part of Arabia, or the Oriental Cush in the vicinity of the Tigris. It is better, since the word has such ambiguity, to retain the original, and to translate it "Cush." For anything that appears, this may have denoted, in the time of Job, the southern part of Arabia. It is known that the topaz was found there. Thus, Pliny says, Lib. xxxvii. 32, Reperta est - in Arabiae insula, quae Citis vocatur; in qua Troglodytae praedones, diutius fame - prossi cum herbas radicesque effoderant, eruerunt topazion. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/28.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19.

Not Ethiopia Abyssinia, or that which lies beyond Egypt in Africa; for, as Ludolphus (x) says, there are no gems found there, or very rarely; but Cush, as the word is, or Arabia Chusaea, the same with the country of Midian, and the parts adjacent; see <a href="/habakkuk/3-7.htm">Habakkuk 3:7</a>; hence Zipporah, the wife of Moses, who was of that country, is called an Ethiopian woman, <a href="/numbers/12-1.htm">Numbers 12:1</a>; and this was near Job's country, who knew the produce of it; and here the topaz is found, as many writers observe. Diodorus Siculus says (y), in Ophiodes, an island in the Arabian gulf, belonging to the Troglodytes, the topaz is found, which is a very clear stone, pleasant to the sight, like to glass, and affording a wonderful golden colour; and with him Strabo (z) agrees, who relates there is an island called Ophiodes, from its being freed from serpents by the king's orders, which killed men that came there for topazes; which, he says, is a clear stone of a golden colour, and so refulgent, that it is not easy to see it in the daytime, being so surrounded with light; but at night it is seen by those that gather it, who set a vessel for a sign, and then dig for it in the daytime; and, he adds, a multitude of men are hired by the kings of Egypt, to gather and keep these stones, and men from stealing them; and, according to Archelaus (a), the topaz is found in Chitis, an island in Arabia, where the Troglodytes digging for herbs and roots find it; and, as Juba relates (b), there is an island called Topazion, in the Red sea, three hundred furlongs (about 73 miles) from the continent, which is cloudy, and is therefore often sought for by navigators; whence he says it had its name Topazion, which in the language of the Troglodytes signifies to seek, and the topaz itself in their language so signifies; in the Samaritan version of <a href="/exodus/39-10.htm">Exodus 39:10</a>; it is called Dachetah, from the Arabic word (c) "Dachatz", the language of the Troglodytes, which signifies to seek and search by removing the earth with the foot. This island seems to be the same with Topazos, which Pliny (d) says is an island of the Arabians, and gave name to a gem, meaning the topaz; but the truth rather is, that the gem gave name to the island: upon the whole, it is no wonder, as Braunius (e) observes, that this gem should be called by Job the Arabian topaz. The Targum here calls it a green pearl; and some have thought the emerald is meant, which is of that colour; and the emeralds of Ethiopia are praised by some, according to Juba (f); and in Egypt were emerald mines the Ethiopians laid a claim to (g); and there were emeralds also in Arabia, as the above Juba relates; however, be this what it may, as it is most likely to be the topaz, it is not equal in value to wisdom, no, not the largest topaz ever known; not even that of the great Mogul, which weighs more than an hundred fifty seven carats, valued at 271,500 French pounds (h); and according to Tavernier (i) it weighs almost an hundred fifty eight carats, and was bought at Goa for almost 272,000 florins: <p>neither shall it be valued with pure gold; that is most refined and freed from dross; they are not to be laid together as of equal value; See Gill on <a href="//biblehub.com/job/28-16.htm">Job 28:16</a>, where the same word is used. <p>(x) Hist.

It is generally allowed that the <span class="accented">pithdath</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b4;&#x5d8;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span>) is either the "topaz" or the "chrysolite." In favour of its being the chrysolite is the passage of Pliny which mentions its being esteemed for its <span class="accented">green</span> tints ('Hist. Nat.,' 37:8). Otherwise "topaz" might have appeared to be the best rendering. By "Cush," here translated "Ethiopia," is probably meant Cushite Arabia, or the southern and south-eastern regions (see the author's 'Origin of Nations,' pp. 206-209). Neither shall it be valued with pare gold. Of the four words used for "gold" in this passage (vers. 15-17), one (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5d4;&#x5d1;</span>) seems to be the common name, and to designate the metal by its coleus, "yellow," since <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;</span> means "to be yellow" Another (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b8;&#x5d2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;</span>) means properly "what is treasured," or "shut up," from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b8;&#x5d2;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>, "to shut." The third (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b7;&#x5d6;</span>) seems to be the name for "native gold," or that found in river-washings and nuggets, which was regarded as the purest. The fourth (<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5d7;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;</span>) is a poetical name only, and designates gold of extreme purity (<a href="/songs/5-11.htm">Song of Solomon 5:11</a>), whether highly refined or native. Job uses them all, to show that there was no gold of any kind wherewith it was possible to purchase wisdom. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/28.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>13  A mortal knoweth not its price,<p>And it is not found in the land of the living.<p>14  The abyss saith: It is not in me,<p>And the sea saith: It is not with me.<p>15  Pure gold cannot be given for it,<p>And silver cannot be weighed as its price;<p>16  And it is not outweighed with fine gold of Ophir,<p>With the precious onyx and the sapphire.<p>It is self-evident that wisdom is found nowhere directly present and within a limited space, as at the bottom of the sea, and cannot be obtained by a direct exchange by means of earthly treasures. It is, moreover, not this self-evident fact that is denied here; but the meaning is, that even if a man should search in every direction through the land of the living, i.e., (as e.g., <a href="/psalms/52-7.htm">Psalm 52:7</a>) the world - if he should search through the &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1501;, i.e., the subterranean waters that feed the visible waters (vid., <a href="/genesis/39-25.htm">Genesis 39:25</a>) - if he should search through the sea, the largest bounded expanse of this water that wells up from beneath - yea, even if he would offer all riches and precious things to put himself in possession of the means and instruments for the acquirement of wisdom, - wisdom, i.e., the profoundest perception of the nature of things, would still be beyond him, and unattainable. &#1506;&#1512;&#1498;, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/28-13.htm">Job 28:13</a>, an equivalent (from &#1506;&#1512;&#1498;, to range beside, to place at the side of), interchanges with &#1502;&#1495;&#1497;&#1512; (from &#1502;&#1495;&#1512;, cogn. &#1502;&#1492;&#1512;, &#1502;&#1499;&#1512;, mercari). &#1505;&#1490;&#1493;&#1512; is &#1494;&#1492;&#1489; &#1505;&#1490;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, <a href="/1_kings/6-20.htm">1 Kings 6:20</a> and freq., which hardly signifies gold shut up  equals  carefully preserved, rather: closed  equals  compressed, unmixed; Targ. &#1491;&#1468;&#1492;&#1489; &#1505;&#1504;&#1497;&#1503;, aurum colatum (purgatum).
