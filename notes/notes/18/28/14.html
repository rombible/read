Its worth is infinitely more than all the riches in this world. It is a gift of the Holy Ghost which cannot be bought with money. Let that which is most precious in God's account, be so in ours. Job asks after it as one that truly desired to find it, and despaired of finding it any where but in God; any way but by Divine revelation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The depth saith - This is a beautiful personification. The object of this verse and the following is, to show that wisdom cannot be found in the deepest recesses to which man can penetrate, nor purchased by anything which man possesses. It must come from God only. The word "depth" here (&#1514;&#1492;&#1493;&#1501;  teho&#770;m) means properly a wave, billow, surge; then a mass of waters, a flood, or the deep ocean, <a href="/deuteronomy/8-7.htm">Deuteronomy 8:7</a>; <a href="/genesis/7-11.htm">Genesis 7:11</a>; <a href="/psalms/36-6.htm">Psalm 36:6</a>; and then a gulf, or abyss. It refers here to the sea, or ocean; and the idea is, that its vast depths might be sounded, and true wisdom would not be found there. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/28.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. Man can fix no price upon it, as it is nowhere to be found in man's abode (Isa 38:11).

This is a very common figure, whereby speech is ascribed to dumb and senseless creatures. The meaning is, This is not to be found in any part of the land or sea, yea, though a man should dig or dive never so deep to find it, nor to be learned from any creatures; for though these discover the being, and power, and in part the wisdom of God, yet they do not instruct us in the methods and grounds of God’s providential dispensations to good and evil men: these are secrets of wisdom reserved for God himself. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/job/28.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>The depth saith, it is not in me,.... That is, the deep places of the earth, that are dug in it, the mines, and the like, could they speak, they would say there are no metal, nor minerals, no rich treasures of gold and silver ore, of pearls and precious stones, in the bowels of it, that are of the value of wisdom, or to be compared to it: <p>and the sea saith, it is not with me; had that a voice to speak, it would freely declare, that there is nothing in its vast compass, at the bottom of it, or to be got out of it, as corals that grow in it, and pearls fished from thence, after mentioned, that are a sufficient price for wisdom. Some understand these words, the former part of miners and colliers, and such sort of men, that dig and live in the depths of the earth; and the latter part of mariners, that are employed on the sea, who are generally ignorant and carnal men, and void of the knowledge of wisdom in every view of it; but the sense first given is best. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/28.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The depth saith, It is not in me: and the sea saith, It is not with me.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/job/28.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">14</span>. Three great regions are mentioned, none of which is the “place” of Wisdom, the land of the living, the deep, and the sea. These three exhaust the extent of the upper world.

They are two grammatically independent predicates, the first of which is only the foil of the other: the earth, out of it cometh forth bread (&#1500;&#1495;&#1501; as <a href="/psalms/104-14.htm">Psalm 104:14</a>), and beneath it (the surface of the earth)  equals  that which lies beneath it (&#1493;&#1514;&#1495;&#1514;&#1497;&#1492; only virtually a subj. in the sense of &#1493;&#1514;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1492;, since &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; occurs only as a preposition), is turned about (comp. the construction of the sing. of the verb with the plur. subj. <a href="/job/30-15.htm">Job 30:15</a>) as (by) fire Instar ignis, scil. subvertentis); i.e., the earth above furnishes nourishment to man, but that not satisfying him, he also digs out its inward parts (comp. Pliny, h. n. xxxiii. proaem.: in sede Manium opes quaerimus, tanquam parum benigna fertilique quaqua calcatur), since this is turned or tossed about (comp. &#1502;&#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1499;&#1492;, the special word for the overthrow of Sodom by fire) by mining work, as when fire breaks out in a house, or even as when a volcanic fire rumbles within a mountain (Castalio: agunt per magna spatia cuniculos et terram subeunt non secus ac ignis facet ut in Aetna et Vesuvio). The reading &#1489;&#1502;&#1493; (Schlottm.) instead of &#1499;&#1502;&#1493; is natural, since fire is really used to blast the rock, and to separate the ore from the stone; but, with the exception of Jerome, who has arbitrarily altered the text (terra, de qua oriebatur panis in loco suo, igni subversa est), all the old translations reproduce &#1499;&#1502;&#1493;, which even Nasse, in opposition to von Veltheim, thinks suitable: Man's restless search, which rummages everything through, is compared to the unrestrainable ravaging fire.<p><a href="/job/28-6.htm">Job 28:6</a> also consists of two grammatically independent assertions: the place (bed) of the sapphire is its rock. Must we refer &#1500;&#1493; to &#1505;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;, and translate: "and it contains fine dust of gold" (Hirz., Umbr., Stick., Nasse)? It is possible, for Theophrastus (p. 692, ed. Schneider) says of the sapphire it is &#x3c9;&#788;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1; &#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, as it were covered with gold dust or grains of gold; and Pliny, h. n. xxxvii. 9, 38f.: Inest ei (cyano) aliquando et aureus pulvis qualis in sapphiris, in iis enim aurum punctis conlucet, which nevertheless does not hold good of the proper sapphire, but of the azure stone (lapis lazuli) which is confounded with it, a variegated species of which, with gold, or rather with iron pyrites glittering like gold, is specially valued.<p>(Note: Comp. Quenstedt, Handbuch der Mineralogie (1863), S. 355 and 302.)<p>But Schultens rightly observes: vix cerdiderim, illum auratilem pulvisculum sapphiri peculiari mentione dignum; and Schlottm.: such a collateral definition to &#1505;&#1508;&#1497;&#1512;, expressed in a special clause (not a relative one), has something awkward about it. On the other hand, &#1506;&#1508;&#1512;&#1514; &#1494;&#1492;&#1489; is a perfectly suitable appellation of gold ore. "The earth, which is in itself black," says Diodorus in the passage quoted before, "is interspersed with veins of marble, which is of such pre-eminent whiteness, that its brilliance surpasses everything that glitters, and from it the overseers of the mine prepare gold with a large number of workmen." And further on, of the heating of this gold ore he says: "the hardest auriferous earth they burn thoroughly in a large fire; thus they make it soft, so that it can be worked by the hand." &#1506;&#1508;&#1512;&#1514; &#1494;&#1492;&#1489; is a still more suitable expression for such auriferous earth and ore than for the nuggets of &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; (i.e., unsmelted) of the size of a chestnut, which, according to Diodorus, ii. 50, are obtained in mines in Arabia (&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;). But it is inadmissible to refer &#1500;&#1493; to man, for the clause would then require to be translated: and gold ore is to him  equals  he has, while it is the rather intended to be said that the interior of the earth has gold ore. &#1500;&#1493; is therefore, with Hahn and Schlottm., to be referred to &#1502;&#1511;&#1493;&#1501;: and this place of the sapphire, it contains gold. The poet might have written &#1500;&#1492;&#1468; but &#1500;&#1493; implies that where the sapphire is found, gold is also found. The following &#1504;&#1514;&#1497;&#1489; (with Dech), together with the following relative clause, is connected with &#1488;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492;, or even with &#1502;&#1511;&#1493;&#1501;, which through <a href="/job/28-6.htm">Job 28:6</a> is become the chief subj.: the place of the sapphire and of the gold is the rock of the bowels of the earth, - a way, which, etc., i.e., such a place is the interior of the earth, accessible to no living being of the earth's surface except to man alone. The sight of the bird of prey, the &#1506;&#1497;&#1496;, &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;, and of the &#1488;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, i.e., the hawk or kite, reaches from above far and wide beneath;<p>(Note: The &#1488;&#1497;&#1492; - says the Talmud b.
