One day's events, and one man's affairs, have such reference to, and so hang one upon another, that He only, to whom all is open, and who sees the whole at one view, can rightly judge of every part. But the knowledge of God's revealed will is within our reach, and will do us good. Let man look upon this as his wisdom, To fear the Lord, and to depart from evil. Let him learn that, and he is learned enough. Where is this wisdom to be found? The treasures of it are hid in Christ, revealed by the word, received by faith, through the Holy Ghost. It will not feed pride or vanity, or amuse our vain curiosity. It teaches and encourages sinners to fear the Lord, and to depart from evil, in the exercise of repentance and faith, without desiring to solve all difficulties about the events of this life.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>It is hid from the eyes of all living - That is, of all people, and of all animals. Man has not found it by the most sagacious of all his discoveries, and the keenest vision of beasts and fowls has not traced it out.<p>And kept close - Hebrew "concealed."<p>From the fowls of the air - Compare the notes at <a href="/job/28-7.htm">Job 28:7</a>. Umbreit remarks, on this passage, that there is attributed to the fowls in Oriental countries a deep knowledge, and an extraordinary gift of divination, and that they appear as the interpreters and confidants of the gods. One cannot but reflect, says he, on the personification of the good spirit of Ormuzd through the fowls, according to the doctrine of the Persians (Compare Creutzer's Symbolik Thes 1. s. 723); upon the ancient fowlking (Vogelkonig) Simurg upon the mountain Kap, representing the highest wisdom of life; upon the discourses of the fowls of the great mystic poet of the Persians, Ferideddin Attar, etc. Among the ancient Greeks and Romans, also, a considerable part of their divinations consisted in observing the flight of birds, as if they were endowed with intelligence, and indicated coming events by the course which they took; compare also, <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-20.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:20</a>, where wisdom or intelligence is ascribed to the birds of the air. "Curse not the king, no, not in thy thought; and curse not the rich in thy bed-chamber: for a bird of the air shall carry the voice, and that which hath wings shall tell the matter." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/28.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21. None can tell whence or where, seeing it, &c.<p>fowls&#8212;The gift of divination was assigned by the heathen especially to birds. Their rapid flight heavenwards and keen sight originated the superstition. Job may allude to it. Not even the boasted divination of birds has an insight into it (Ec 10:20). But it may merely mean, as in Job 28:7, It escapes the eye of the most keen-sighted bird.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/job/28.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Of all living; </span> of all men that live upon the earth. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">From the fowls of the air:</span> though they fly high, and can see far and well, yet they cannot discern this: men of the most raised understandings cannot discover it.
