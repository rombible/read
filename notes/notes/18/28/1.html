That Job should say this is but natural, after his painful experience of the want of wisdom in his friends.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/job/28.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/job/28-1.htm" title="Surely there is a vein for the silver, and a place for gold where they fine it.">Job 28:1</a></span>. <span class="ital">Surely, </span>&c. — Job, having confuted his three friends on their own principles, in the last two and some of the preceding chapters, here falls into a kind of soliloquy on the difficulty of obtaining true wisdom. His friends had laid claim to it from their great age, and from their knowledge of ancient traditions: see <a href="/job/5-27.htm" title="See this, we have searched it, so it is; hear it, and know you it for your good.">Job 5:27</a>, and <a href="/context/job/8-8.htm" title="For inquire, I pray you, of the former age, and prepare yourself to the search of their fathers:...">Job 8:8-9</a>, and <a href="/context/job/15-9.htm" title="What know you, that we know not? what understand you, which is not in us?...">Job 15:9-10</a>, and <a href="/job/20-4.htm" title="Know you not this of old, since man was placed on earth,">Job 20:4</a>; but he had shown them of how little importance or signification their conclusions were. Where, then, it became the question, is wisdom to be found? To answer this question is the intent of Job’s discourse in this chapter, which is evidently an inquiry after wisdom; not the unsearchable depths of God’s counsels, but wisdom in general; or, rather, the wisdom proper to man: see <a href="/job/28-28.htm" title="And to man he said, Behold, the fear of the LORD, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding.">Job 28:28</a>. Job here determines, that even that wisdom is not attainable by the human capacity and industry without a revelation from God. The several arts of discovering and purifying silver, of refining gold, making iron and brass from the ore, the art of mining itself, the secrets of husbandry, are all within the reach of human ability and diligence: but to comprehend the ways of Divine Providence, and understand the reasons of God’s dispensations toward mankind, whether the righteous or the wicked, is above man’s capacity, and can only be known so far as God is pleased to reveal them: that God, however, has furnished man with a sufficient rule to walk by, and that to attend to it is his highest wisdom, and, indeed, the only way to be truly wise; all other speculations and attempts to attain true wisdom being vain and fruitless.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">There is a vein for silver, </span>&c. — Thus the chapter begins with a fine description of the indefatigable industry and ardour of mankind in searching after things which contribute either to the use or ornament of life; how they dig into the bowels of the earth for metals, gold, silver, iron, brass; and that the industry or avarice of man is without bounds: he searcheth into the land of darkness itself for hidden treasures. The word rendered <span class="ital">vein, </span><span class="greekheb">מוצא</span>, <span class="ital">mutza, </span>signifies properly a <span class="ital">going forth; there is a going forth for the silver: </span>that is, “man hath found where silver may be dug out of the earth.” <span class="ital">And a place for gold where they fine it — </span>Or, as it is in the margin, rather, <span class="ital">for gold which they fine. </span>For he speaks not here of the works of men and of art, but of those of God and nature, as is manifest from the foregoing and following words.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/job/28.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>28:1-11 Job maintained that the dispensations of Providence were regulated by the highest wisdom. To confirm this, he showed of what a great deal of knowledge and wealth men may make themselves masters. The caverns of the earth may be discovered, but not the counsels of Heaven. Go to the miners, thou sluggard in religion, consider their ways, and be wise. Let their courage and diligence in seeking the wealth that perishes, shame us out of slothfulness and faint-heartedness in labouring for the true riches. How much better is it to get wisdom than gold! How much easier, and safer! Yet gold is sought for, but grace neglected. Will the hopes of precious things out of the earth, so men call them, though really they are paltry and perishing, be such a spur to industry, and shall not the certain prospect of truly precious things in heaven be much more so?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Surely there is a vein for silver - Margin, "mine" Coverdale renders this, "There are places where silver is molten." Prof. Lee renders it, "There is an outlet for the silver," and supposes it means the coming out or separation of the silver from the earthy particles by which it is surrounded in the ore, not the coming out from the mine. The word rendered "vein" (&#1502;&#1493;&#1510;&#1488;  mo&#770;tsa&#770;') means properly a going forth, as the rising of the sun, <a href="/psalms/19-6.htm">Psalm 19:6</a>; the promulgation of an edict <a href="/daniel/9-25.htm">Daniel 9:25</a>; then a place of going forth - as a gate, door; <a href="/ezekiel/42-11.htm">Ezekiel 42:11</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-11.htm">Ezekiel 43:11</a>, and thence a mine, a vein, or a place of the going forth of metals; that is, a place where they are procured. So the Septuagint here, &#x395;&#787;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; &#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c1; &#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#837; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;  Esti gar argurio&#772; topos hothen ginetai - "there is a place for silver whence it is obtained." The idea here is that man had evinced his wisdom in finding out the mines of silver and working them. It was one of the instances of his skill that he had been able to penetrate into the earth, and bring out the ore of the precious metals, and convert it to valuable purposes.<p>And a place for gold - A workshop, or laboratory, for working the precious metals. Job says, that even in his time such a laboratory was a proof of the wisdom of man. So now, one of the most striking proofs of skill is to be found in the places where the precious metals are purified, and worked into the various forms in which they are adapted to ornament and use.<p>Where they fine it -  - &#1497;&#1494;&#1511;&#1493;  ya&#772;zoqu&#770;. The word used here (&#1494;&#1511;&#1511;  za&#770;qaq) means properly to bind fast, to fetter; and then to compress, to squeeze through a strainer; and hence, to strain, filter; and thence to purify - as wine that is thus filtered, or gold that is purified <a href="/malachi/3-3.htm">Malachi 3:3</a>. It may refer here to any process of purifying or refining. It is commonly done by the application of heat. One of the instructive uses of the book of Job is the light which it throws incidentally on the state of the ancient arts and sciences, and the condition of society in reference to the comforts of life at the early period of the world when the author lived. In this passage it is clear:<p>(1) that the metals were then in general use, and<p>(2) that they were so worked as to furnish, in the view of Job a striking illustration of human wisdom and skill.<p>Society was so far advanced as to make use not only of gold and silver, but also of copper and brass. The use of gold and silver commonly precedes the discovery of iron, and consequently the mention of iron in any ancient book indicates a considerably advanced state of society. It is of course, not known to what extent the art of working metals was carried in the time of Job, as all that would be indicated here would be that the method of obtaining the pure metal from the ore was understood. It may be interesting, however, to observe, that the art was early known to the Egyptians, and was carried by them to a considerable degree of perfection. Pharaoh arrayed Joseph in vestures of fine linen, and put a chain of gold about his neck; <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/41-42.htm">Genesis 41:42</a>, and great quantities of gold and silver ornaments were borrowed by the Israelites of the Egyptians, when they were about to go to the promised land. Gold and silver are mentioned as known in the earliest ages; compare <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/2-11.htm">Genesis 2:11-12</a>; <a href="/genesis/41-42.htm">Genesis 41:42</a>; <a href="/exodus/20-23.htm">Exodus 20:23</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/23-15.htm">Genesis 23:15-16</a>. Iron is also mentioned as having been early known; <a href="/genesis/4-22.htm">Genesis 4:22</a>. Tubal Cain was instructor in iron and brass. Gold and silver mines were early worked in Egypt, and if Moses was the compiler of the book of Job, it is possible that some of the descriptions here may have been derived from that country, and at all events the mode of working these precious metals was probably the same in Arabia and Egypt. From the mention of ear rings, bracelets, and jewels of silver and gold, in the days of Abraham, it is evident that the art of metallurgy was known at a very remote period. Workmen are noticed by Homer as excelling in the manufacture of arms, rich vases, and other objects inlaid or ornamented with vessels:<p>&#x3a0;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; &#x3b4; &#787; &#x3b1;&#787;&#834;&#x3b9;&#x3c8; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1; &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;,<p>&#x391;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c1;&#x3b1; &#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;.<p>Pe&#772;leide&#772;s d' aips alla tithei tachute&#772;nos aethla,<p>Argirepm krate&#772;ra tetugmeion.<p>Iliad xxiii. 741.<p>His account of the shield of Achilles (Iliad xviii. 474) proves that the art of working in the precious metals was well known in his time; and the skill required to delineate the various objects which he describes was such as no ordinary artisan, even at this time, could be supposed to possess. In Egypt, ornaments of gold and silver, consisting of rings, bracelets, necklaces, and trinkets, have been found in considerable abundance of the times of Osirtasen I, and Thothmes III, the contemporaries of Joseph and of Moses. Diodorus (i. 49) mentions silver mine of Egypt which produced 3,200 myriads of minae. The gold mines of Egypt remained long unknown, and their position has been ascertained only a few years since by M. Linant and M. Bonomi. They lie in the Bisharee desert, about seventeen days' journey to the South-eastward from Derow. The matrix in which the gold in Egypt was found is quartz, and the excavations to procure the gold are exceedingly deep.<p>The principal excavation is 180 feet deep. The quartz thus obtained was broken by the workmen into small fragments, of the size of a bean, and these were passed through hand mills made of granitic stone, and when reduced to powder the quartz was washed on inclined tables, and the gold was thus separated from the stone. Diodorus says, that the principal persons engaged in mining operations were captives, taken in war, and persons who were compelled to labor in the mines, for offences against the government. They were bound in fetters, and compelled to labor night and day. "No attention," he says, "is paid to these persons; they have not even a piece of rag to cover themselves; and so wretched is their condition, that every one who witnesses it, deplores the excessive misery which they endure. No rest, no intermission from toil, are given either to the sick or the maimed; neither the weakness of age, nor women's infirmities, are regarded; all are driven to the work with the lash, until, at last, overcome with the intolerable weight of their afflictions, they die in the midst of their toil."<p>Diodorus adds, "Nature indeed, I think, teaches that as gold is obtained with immense labor, so it is kept with difficulty, creating great anxiety, and attended in its use both with pleasure and with grief." It was perhaps, in view of such laborious and difficult operations in obtaining the precious metals, and of the skill which man had evinced in extracting them from the earth, that Job alluded here to the process as a striking proof of human wisdom. On the early use of the metals among the ancient Egyptians, the reader may consult with advantage, Wilkinsoh's "Manners and Customs of the Ancient Egyptians," vol. iii. pp. 215ff. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/28.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 28<p>Job 28:1-28. Job's Speech Continued.<p>In the twenty-seventh chapter Job had tacitly admitted that the statement of the friends was often true, that God vindicated His justice by punishing the wicked here; but still the affliction of the godly remained unexplained. Man has, by skill, brought the precious metals from their concealment. But the Divine Wisdom, which governs human affairs, he cannot similarly discover (Job 28:12, &c.). However, the image from the same metals (Job 23:10) implies Job has made some way towards solving the riddle of his life; namely, that affliction is to him as the refining fire is to gold.<p>1. vein&#8212;a mine, from which it goes forth, Hebrew, "is dug."<p>place for gold&#8212;a place where gold may be found, which men refine.

The connexion of this chapter with the former is difficult, and diversly apprehended; but this may seem to be the fairest account of it: Job having in the last chapter discoursed of God’s various providences and carriages towards wicked men, and showed that God doth sometimes for a season give them wealth and prosperity, but afterwards calls them to a sad account, and punisheth them severely for their abuse of his mercies; and having formerly showed that God doth sometimes prosper the wicked all their days, so as they live and die without any visible token of God’s displeasure against them, when, on the contrary, good men are exercised with many and grievous calamities; and perceiving that his friends were, as men in all ages have been, scandalized at these methods of Divine Providence, and denied the thing, because they could not understand the reason of such unequal dispensations: in this chapter he declares that this is one of the depths and secrets of Divine Wisdom, not discoverable by any mortal man in this world; and that although men had some degree of wisdom whereby they could dig deep, and search out many hidden things, as the veins of silver, gold, &c., yet this was a wisdom of a higher nature, and out of man’s reach. And hereby he secretly checks the arrogance and confidence of his friends, who, because they had some parts of wisdom, the knowledge of natural things, such as are here contained, and of human affairs, and of some Divine matters, therefore presumed to fathom the depths of God’s wisdom and providence, and to judge of all God’s ways and works by the scantling of their own narrow understandings. Possibly it may be connected thus: Job having been discoursing of the wonderful ways of God, both in the works of nature, <span class="bld"><a href="/context/job/26-5.htm" title="Dead things are formed from under the waters, and the inhabitants thereof....">Job 26:5-14</a></span>, and in his providential dispensations towards wicked men, <span class="bld"><a href="/context/job/27-13.htm" title="This is the portion of a wicked man with God, and the heritage of oppressors, which they shall receive of the Almighty....">Job 27:13-23</a></span> to the end, he here returns to the first branch of his discourse, and discovers more of God’s wisdom and power in natural things. And this he doth partly, that by this manifestation of his singular skill in the ways and actions of God, he might vindicate himself from that contempt which they seemed to have of him, and oblige them to hear what he had further to say with more attention and consideration; and partly that by this representation of the manifold wisdom and power of God, they might be wrought to a greater reverence for God and for his works, and not presume to judge so rashly and boldly of them, and to condemn what they did not understand in them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Where they fine it; </span> or rather, as it is in the margin of our Bibles, which they, to wit, the refiners, <span class="ital">do fine</span>. For he speaks not here of the works of men and of art, but of God and of nature, as is manifest from the foregoing and following words. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/job/28.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Surely there is a vein for the silver,.... Silver is mentioned first, not because the most valuable, for gold is preferable to it, as brass is to iron, and yet iron is mentioned first in <a href="/job/28-2.htm">Job 28:2</a>; but because silver might be first known, or was first in use, especially in the coinage of money; we read of pieces of silver, or shekels of silver, in the times of Abraham, but not of any golden coin, <a href="/genesis/23-15.htm">Genesis 23:15</a>; and among the old Romans silver was coined before gold (p); it has its name from a word which signifies "desire", because it is desirable to men, it answering to various uses and purposes; and sometimes the desires and cravings of men after it are enlarged too far, and become criminal, and so the root of all evil to them: and now there is a "vein" for it in the earth, or a mine in which it may be dug for, and found, in which it runs as veins in a man's body, in certain ramifications, like branches of trees, as they do; and the inhabitants of Hispaniola, and other parts of the West Indies, when found out by Columbus, which abounded with gold mines, declared that they found by experience that the vein of gold is a living tree, (and so the same, perhaps, may be said of silver,) and that it spreads and springs from the root, which they say extends to the centre of the earth by soft pores and passages of the earth, and puts forth branches, even to the uppermost part of the earth, and ceases not till it discovers itself unto the open air; at which time it shows forth certain beautiful colours instead of flowers, round stones of golden earth instead of fruits, and thin plates instead of leaves (q); so here there is a vein, or a "going out for the silver" (r), by which it makes its way, as observed of the gold, and shows itself by some signs and tokens where it may be found; or rather this egress is made for it, by opening the mine where it is, digging into it, and fetching it out of it, and from whence great quantities are often brought. In Solomon's time it was made as the stones in Jerusalem, <a href="/1_kings/10-27.htm">1 Kings 10:27</a>; <p>and a place for gold where they fine it; there are particular places for this most excellent of all metals, which has its name in Hebrew from its yellow colour; all countries do not produce it; some are famous for it, and some parts of them, as the land of Havilah, where was gold, and that gold was good, <a href="/genesis/2-11.htm">Genesis 2:11</a>; and Ophir; hence we often read of the gold of Ophir, so called from the place where it was found, as in this chapter, <a href="/job/28-16.htm">Job 28:16</a>; and now the Spanish West Indies; but nearer to Job than these gold was found; there were not only mountains that abounded with gold near to Horeb, in the desert of Arabia (s), but it was to be found with the Sabeans (t), the near neighbours of Job; yea, the Ophir before referred to was in Arabia. Some understand this of the place where pure gold is found already refined, and needs no melting and refining; and of such Pliny (u) speaks, and of large lumps and masses of it; but for the most part it lies in ore, which needs refining; and so here it may intend the place where it is found in the ore, and from whence it is taken and had to the place where it is refined; for melting places used to be near where the golden ore was found; and so when Hispaniola was first found by Columbus, the gold that was dug out of the mountains of Cibana, and other places, were brought to two shops, which were erected with all things appertaining to melt and refine it, and cast into wedges; and so early as that, in these two shops, were molten yearly three hundred thousand pound weight of gold (w). <p>(p) Plin.

Probably we are to regard Job as led to see, even while he is justifying God's ways with sinners (<a href="/job/27-8.htm">Job 27:8-23</a>), how many and how great are the difficulties in the way of forming a single consistent theory of the Divine action, which shall be applicable to all cases. Hence he comes to the conclusion that God is incomprehensible by man and inscrutable; and that it is only given to man to know him sufficiently for his practical guidance. To impress this on his hearers is his main object (vers. 12-28); and, to impress it the more, he introduces it by a sharp contrast. Wonderful as is man's cleverness and ingenuity in respect of earthly things and physical phenomena (vers. 1-11), with respect to heavenly things and the spiritual world - wherewith  true wisdom is concerned - he knows next to nothing. All that he knows is just enough to guide his conduct aright (ver. 28). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Surely there is a vein for the silver</span>; literally, <span class="accented">an issue for silver? i.e.</span> a place or places whence it is drawn forth from the earth. The silver-mines of Spain were very early worked by the Phoenicians, and produced the metal in great abundance (see the author's 'History of Phoenicia,' p. 314). But Asia itself was probably the source whence silver was obtained in primitive times. And a place for gold where they fine it; or, fuse it. Gold is very widely spread over the earth's surface, and in ancient times was especially abundant in Arabia (Diod. Sic.. 2:1; 3:42; Strabo, 16:4. &sect; 18; Pit,y, 'Hist. Nat.,' 6:32, etc.); so that Job might easily have been acquainted with the processes of fusing and refining it. Two processes of refining are mentioned by Diodorus as practised by the Egyptians (3:11). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/27.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>13  This is the lot of the wicked man with God,<p>And the heritage of the violent which they receive from the Almighty:<p>14  If his children multiply, it is for the sword,<p>And his offspring have not bread enough.<p>15  His survivors shall be buried by the pestilence,<p>And his widows shall not weep.<p>16  If he heapeth silver together as dust,<p>And prepareth garments for himself as mire:<p>17  He prepareth it, and the righteous clothe themselves,<p>And the innocent divide the silver among themselves.<p>18  He hath built as a moth his house,<p>And as a hut that a watchman setteth up.<p>We have already had the combination &#1488;&#1491;&#1501; &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; for &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; in <a href="/job/20-29.htm">Job 20:29</a>; it is a favourite expression in Proverbs, and reminds one of &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#788;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; in Homer, and &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#986;, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;, &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, in the parables <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/13.htm">Matthew 13</a>.

The sword, famine, and pestilence are the three punishing powers by which the evil-doer's posterity, however numerous it may be, is blotted out; these three, &#1495;&#1512;&#1489;, &#1512;&#1506;&#1489;, and &#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, appear also side by side in <a href="/jeremiah/15-2.htm">Jeremiah 15:2</a>; &#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, instead of &#1502;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;, diris mortibus, is (as also <a href="/jeremiah/18-21.htm">Jeremiah 18:21</a>) equivalent to &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; in the same trio, <a href="/jeremiah/14-12.htm">Jeremiah 14:12</a>; the plague is personified (as when it is called by an Arabian poet umm el-farit, the mother of death), and Vavassor correctly observes: Mors illos sua sepeliet, nihil praeterea honoris supremi consecuturos. Bttcher (de inferis, 72) asserts that &#1489;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; can only signify pestilentiae tempore, or better, ipso mortis momento; but since &#1489;&#1468; occurs by the passive elsewhere in the sense of ab or per, e.g., <a href="/numbers/36-2.htm">Numbers 36:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/14-4.htm">Hosea 14:4</a>, it can also by &#1504;&#1511;&#1489;&#1512; denote the efficient cause.

The treasure in gold which his avarice has heaped up, and in garments which his love of display has gathered together, come into the possession of the righteous and the innocent, who are spared when these three powers of judgment sweep away the evil-doer and his family. Dust and dirt (i.e., of the streets, &#1495;&#1493;&#1510;&#1493;&#1514;) are, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/9-3.htm">Zechariah 9:3</a>, the emblem of a great abundance that depreciates even that which is valuable. The house of the ungodly man, though a palace, is, as the fate of the fabric shows, as brittle and perishable a thing, and can be as easily destroyed, as the fine spinning of a moth, &#1506;&#1513;&#1473; (according to the Jewish proverb, the brother of the &#1505;&#1505;), or even the small case which it makes from remnants of gnawed articles, and drags about with it; it is like a light hut, perhaps for the watchman of a vineyard (<a href="/isaiah/1-8.htm">Isaiah 1:8</a>), which is put together only for the season during which the grapes are ripening.<p>continued...</body></html>
