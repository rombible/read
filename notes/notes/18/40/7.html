And those who are truly convinced of sin, yet need to be more thoroughly convinced and more humbled. No doubt God, and he only, has power to humble and bring down proud men; he has wisdom to know when and how to do it, and it is not for us to teach him how to govern the world. Our own hands cannot save us by recommending us to God's grace, much less rescuing us from his justice; and therefore into his hand we must commit ourselves. The renewal of a believer proceeds in the same way of conviction, humbling, and watchfulness against remaining sin, as his first conversion. When convinced of many evils in our conduct, we still need convincing of many more.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/40.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Gird up thy loins now like a man - An expression taken from the ancient mode of dress. That was a loose, flowing robe, which was secured by a girdle when traveling, or when one entered upon anything requiring energy; see the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/5-38.htm">Matthew 5:38-41</a>. The meaning here is, "Prepare thyself for the highest effort that can be made.

That is, I will submit some questions to you to be answered.<p>And declare thou unto me - Hebrew "Cause me to know." That is, furnish a satisfactory answer to these inquiries, so as to show that you understand the subject. The object is to appeal to the proofs of divine wisdom, and to show that the whole subject was far above human comprehension. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/40.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7.
