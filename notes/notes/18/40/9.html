The power of creatures, even of angels themselves, is derived from God, limited by him, dependant on him; but the power of God is original, independent, and unlimited: he can do every thing without us; we can do nothing without him; and therefore we have not an arm like God. The meaning is, Thou art infinitely short of God in power, and therefore in justice: for all his perfections are equal and infinite. Injustice is much more likely to be in thee, an impotent creature, than in the Almighty God; see on <a href="/job/40-2.htm" title="Shall he that contends with the Almighty instruct him? he that reproves God, let him answer it.">Job 40:2</a>. <span class="ital">Canst thou thunder with a voice like him? — </span>No: his voice will soon drown thine; and one of his mighty thunders will overpower and overrule thy weak speeches.

And those who are truly convinced of sin, yet need to be more thoroughly convinced and more humbled. No doubt God, and he only, has power to humble and bring down proud men; he has wisdom to know when and how to do it, and it is not for us to teach him how to govern the world. Our own hands cannot save us by recommending us to God's grace, much less rescuing us from his justice; and therefore into his hand we must commit ourselves. The renewal of a believer proceeds in the same way of conviction, humbling, and watchfulness against remaining sin, as his first conversion. When convinced of many evils in our conduct, we still need convincing of many more.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/40.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Hast thou an arm like God? - The arm is the symbol of strength.

Such power as he has, which is infinite, almighty, and uncontrollable, and therefore there is no contending with him; as he has an arm on which good men may lean on and trust in, and by which they are supported, protected, and saved, so he has an arm to crush like a moth all that strive with him or against him; <p>or canst thou thunder with a voice like him? thunder is his voice; see <a href="//biblehub.com/job/37-4.htm">Job 37:4</a>, &amp;c. and is expressive of his power, <a href="/job/26-14.htm">Job 26:14</a>; and his powerful voice may be observed in calling all things out of nothing into being in creation; in commanding and ordering all things in providence according to his pleasure; and in quickening sinners through his Gospel, by his Spirit and grace in conversion, and will be in calling men out of their graves and summoning them to judgment at the last day.

As Job questions the manner of the Almighty’s rule of the world, God invites him to deck himself with the thunder and majesty of the supreme ruler, and himself undertake the government of the world; and in the execution of this government to bring low all that is proud (comp. <a href="/isaiah/2-12.htm" title="For the day of the LORD of hosts shall be on every one that is proud and lofty, and on every one that is lifted up; and he shall be brought low:">Isaiah 2:12</a> <span class="ital">seq</span>.), to subdue and keep down the forces of evil, and hide the faces of the wicked in darkness.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Under this ironical invitation to Job there lie two general thoughts, <span class="ital">first</span>, that omnipotence is necessary in the ruler of all; and <span class="ital">second</span>, that rule of the world consists in keeping in check the forces of evil. This is the idea under which rule of the world is conceived; in other words it is regarded as necessarily moral; and it is assumed that God’s rule is in fact a rule of this kind. In his present frame of mind Job probably would not now contest this. But if God’s rule be moral on the whole, it must be so in every particular; real exceptions are inconceivable, however like exceptions many things may appear.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/40.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hast thou an arm like God?</span> The might of God's arm is often dwelt upon in Scripture.
