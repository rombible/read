But different constructions are put upon this verse also by learned men. Bochart and several others think the former clause should be read with an interrogation, thus, <span class="ital">Who will, </span>or <span class="ital">who can take him in his eyes? </span>That is, while he sees them, and is sensible what they are about: or openly, and by manifest force? Surely none. His force and strength are too great for men to resist and overcome, and therefore they are compelled to make use of many wiles and stratagems to take him; which is true, both of the elephant and of the hippopotamus. And the latter clause is rendered by Heath, <span class="ital">Can cords be drawn through his nose? </span>and by Houbigant, <span class="ital">Can his nose be perforated with hooks? </span>“The way of taking these animals,” (the hippopotami,) says Dr. Dodd, “as related by Achilles Tatius, will explain this passage. The huntsmen, having found the places where they haunt, dig a trench or ditch, which they cover with reeds and earth, having placed underneath a wooden chest whose lids are opens like a folding-door, on each side, to the height of the cavity; after this they conceal themselves, watching till the beast is taken; for as soon as ever it treads on the surface of the hole, it is sure to fall to the bottom. The huntsmen run up immediately to the cavity and shut down the lids, and by these means catch the beast, which could not be taken by any other method, on account of its prodigious strength.” The latter clause of the verse signifies literally, <span class="ital">Canst thou bore his nose with cords? </span>But this kind of boring is made by a hook, in order to insert a cord to lead the creature about with pleasure. It is very remarkable, that this cord in the ox’s nose serves instead of a bit to guide him. This Thevenot confirms in his <span class="ital">Voyage to Indostan, </span>where, having mentioned that oxen are used instead of horses for travelling, he adds, “These creatures are managed like our horses, and have no other bits or bridles than a cord which passes through the tendon of their nose or nostrils.” So that this boring his nose and introducing a cord were not to take, but to keep him, in order to make him serviceable when taken. — Heath. I would just observe upon this and the following description, that nervous and excellent as they are, they do not strike us with the same degree of admiration as the foregoing description of the horse, because we are not so well acquainted with the nature of the animals described. Dr. Young renders the last two verses of this chapter thus: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><span class="ital">“His eye drinks Jordan up, when fired with drought,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>He trusts to turn its current down his throat:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In lessen’d waves it creeps along the plain,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>He sinks a river, and he thirsts again.”</span></span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The reader who can have access to the <span class="ital">Encyclop.

Behemoth signifies beasts. Most understand it of an animal well known in Egypt, called the river-horse, or hippopotamus. This vast animal is noticed as an argument to humble ourselves before the great God; for he created this vast animal, which is so fearfully and wonderfully made. Whatever strength this or any other creature has, it is derived from God. He that made the soul of man, knows all the ways to it, and can make the sword of justice, his wrath, to approach and touch it. Every godly man has spiritual weapons, the whole armour of God, to resist, yea, to overcome the tempter, that his never-dying soul may be safe, whatever becomes of his frail flesh and mortal body.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/40.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He taketh it with his eyes - Margin, "Or, will any take him in his sight, or, bore his nose with a gin!" From this marginal reading it is evident that our translators were much perplexed with this passage. Expositors have been also much embarrassed in regard to its meaning, and have differed much in their exposition. Rosenmuller supposes that this is to be regarded as a question, and is to be rendered, "Will the hunter take him while he sees him?" - meaning that he could not be taken without some snare or guile. The same view also is adopted by Bochart, who says that the hippopotamus could be taken only by some secret snare or pitfall. The common mode of taking him, he says, was to excavate a place near where the river horse usually lay, and to cover it over with reeds and canes, so that he would fall into it unawares. The meaning then is, that the hunter could not approach him openly and secure him while he saw him, but that some secret plan must be adopted to take him. The meaning then is, "Can he be taken when he sees the hunter?"<p>His nose pierceth through snares - Or rather, "When taken in snares, can anyone pierce his nose?" That is, Can the hunter even then pierce his nose so as to put in a ring or cord, and lead him wherever he pleases? This was the common method by which a wild animal was secured when taken (see the notes at <a href="/isaiah/37-29.htm">Isaiah 37:29</a>), but it is here said that this could not be done to this huge animal. He could not be subdued in this manner. He was a wild, untamed and fierce animal, that defied all the usual methods by which wild beasts were made captive. In regard to the difficulty of taking this animal, see the account of the method by which it is now done, in the notes at <a href="/job/40-15.htm">Job 40:15</a>. That account shows that there is a striking accuracy in the description. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/40.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24. Rather, "Will any take him by open force" (literally, "before his eyes"), "or pierce his nose with cords?" No; he can only be taken by guile, and in a pitfall (Job 41:1, 2).   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/job/40.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> According to this translation the sense is this, <span class="ital">He taketh, or snatcheth, or draweth up</span> (as was now said, <span class="bld"><a href="/job/40-23.htm" title="Behold, he drinks up a river, and hastens not: he trusts that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth.">Job 40:23</a></span>) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">it</span> (to wit, the river Jordan) with his eyes, i.e. when he sees it, he trusteth that he can drink it all up; as we use to say, <span class="ital">The eye is bigger than the belly: his nose or snout pierceth</span>, &c., i.e. he securely thrusteth his snout into the river, even to the bottom of it, to stir up the mud, because he delights to drink muddy water; and if there be any snares laid for other creatures, he breaks them to pieces. But this verse is otherwise translated by others. <span class="ital">Will</span> or <span class="ital">can</span> any man <span class="ital">take him in his eyes</span>, (i.e. openly, and by manifest force? Surely no.

No. He may be taken by art and cunning, but not by violence. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/job/40.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>He taketh it with his eyes,.... Or "can men take him before his eyes?" so Mr. Broughton; and others translate it to the same purpose; no, he is not to be taken openly, but privately, by some insidious crafty methods; whether it be understood of the elephant or river horse; elephants, according to Strabo (q) and Pliny (r) were taken in pits dug for them, into which they were decoyed; in like manner, according to some (s), the river horse is taken; a pit being dug and covered with reeds and sand, it falls into it unawares; <p>his nose pierceth through snares; he discerns them oftentimes and escapes them, so that he is not easily taken in them. It is reported of the sea morss (t), before mentioned; see Gill on <a href="//biblehub.com/job/40-20.htm">Job 40:20</a>, that they ascend mountains in great herds, where, before they give themselves to sleep, to which they are naturally inclined, they appoint one of their number as it were a watchman; who, if he chances to sleep or to be slain by the hunter, the rest may be easily taken; but if the watchman gives warning by roaring as the manner is, the whole herd immediately awake and fall down from the mountains with great swiftness into the sea, as before described; or, as Mr. Broughton, "cannot men take him, to pierce his nose with many snares?" they cannot; the elephant has no nose to be pierced, unless his trunk can be called so, and no hook nor snare can be put into the nose of the river horse. Diodorus Siculus (u) says, it cannot be taken but by many vessels joining together and surrounding it, and striking it with iron hooks, to one of which ropes are fastened, and so the creature is let go till it expires. The usual way of taking it now is, by baiting the hook with the roots of water lilies, at which it will catch, and swallow the hook with it; and by giving it line enough it will roll and tumble about, until, through loss of blood, it faints and dies. The way invented by Asdrubal for killing elephants was by striking a carpenter's chopping axe into his ear (w); the Jews (x) say a fly is a terror to an elephant, it enters into his nose and torments him grievously. <p>(q) Geograph. l. 15. p. 484.

It is, as Bochart has first of all shown, the so-called river or Nile horse, Hippopotamus amphibius (in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/30-6.htm">Isaiah 30:6</a>, &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; &#1504;&#1490;&#1489;, as emblem of Egypt, which extends its power, and still is active in the interest of others), found in the rivers of Africa, but no longer found in the Nile, which is not inappropriately called a horse; the Arab. water-hog is better, Italian bomarino, Eng. sea-cow ?, like the Egyptian p-ehe-mau. The change of p and b in the exchange of Egyptian and Semitic words occurs also elsewhere, e.g., pug' and &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509;, harpu and &#1495;&#1512;&#1489; (&#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;), Apriu and &#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; (according to Lauth). Nevertheless p-ehe-mau (not mau-t, for what should the post-positive fem. art. do here?) is first of all only the &#1489;&#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; translated back again into the Egyptian by Jablonsky; an instance in favour of this is still wanting.
