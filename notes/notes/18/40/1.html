There is need to be thoroughly convinced and humbled, to prepare us for remarkable deliverances. After God had shown Job, by his manifest ignorance of the works of nature, how unable he was to judge of the methods and designs of Providence, he puts a convincing question to him; Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct him? Now Job began to melt into godly sorrow: when his friends reasoned with him, he did not yield; but the voice of the Lord is powerful. When the Spirit of truth is come, he shall convince. Job yields himself to the grace of God. He owns himself an offender, and has nothing to say to justify himself. He is now sensible that he has sinned; and therefore he calls himself vile. Repentance changes men's opinion of themselves. Job is now convinced of his error. Those who are truly sensible of their own sinfulness and vileness, dare not justify themselves before God. He perceived that he was a poor, mean, foolish, and sinful creature, who ought not to have uttered one word against the Divine conduct. One glimpse of God's holy nature would appal the stoutest rebel. How, then will the wicked bear the sight of his glory at the day of judgment? But when we see this glory revealed in Jesus Christ, we shall be humbled without being terrified; self-abasement agrees with filial love.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/40.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Moreover, the Lord answered Job - The word "answered" is used here as it is often in the Scriptures, not to denote a reply to what had been immediately said, but to take up or continue an argument.

God calls upon Job to make good his charges (vers. 1, 2). Job declines, acknowledges himself to be of no account, and promises silence and submission for the future (vers. 3-5).

Here haw&#305;&#770;d signifies the sound of the bells which those who wish to announce themselves as warriors hang about their horses, to draw the attention of the enemy to them. Mubershema&#770;t are the mares that carry the bure&#770;shima&#770;n, i.e., the bells. The meaning therefore is: thou couldst hear this sound, which ought only to be heard in the fray, in flight, when the warriors consecrated to death fled as cowards. Taijr (Te&#770;ja&#770;r) is Slih the son of Cana'an (died about 1815), mentioned in p. 456, note 1, a great warrior of the wandering tribe of the 'Aneze. - Wetzst.)<p>The substantival clause is intended to affirm that its dull-toned snort causes or spreads terror. In <a href="/job/39-21.htm">Job 39:21</a> the plur. alternates with the sing., since, as it appears, the representation of the many pawing hoofs is blended with that of the pawing horse, according to the well-known line,<p>Quadrupedante putrem sonitu quatit ungula campum<p>(Virgil, Aen. viii. 596);<p>or, since this is said of the galloping horse, according to the likewise Virgilian line,<p>Cavatque<p>Tellurem, et solido graviter sonat ungula cornu<p>(Georg. iii. 87 f).<p>&#1495;&#1508;&#1512; is, as the Arab. ha&#770;fir, hoof, shows, the proper word for the horse's impatient pawing of the ground (whence it then, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/39-29.htm">Job 39:29</a>, signifies rimari, scrutari). &#1506;&#1502;&#1511; is the plain as the place of contest; for the description, as now becomes still more evident, refers to the war-horse. The verb &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1513;&#1474; (&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;) has its radical signification exsultare (comp. Arab. s]ts, skirta'n, of the foetus) here; and since &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1495;, not &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1495;, is added to it, it is not to be translated: it rejoices in its strength, but: it prances or is joyous with strength, lxx &#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#834;&#837; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x399;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b9;&#836;. The difference between the two renderings is, however, scarcely perceptible. &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;, armament, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/39-21.htm">Job 39:21</a>, is meton. the armed host of the enemy; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1492;, "the quiver," is, however, not used metonymically for the arrows of the enemy whizzing about the horse (Schult.), but <a href="/job/39-23.htm">Job 39:23</a> is the concluding description of the horse that rushes on fearlessly, proudly, and impetuously in pursuit, under the rattle and glare of the equipment of its rider (Schlottm. and others). &#1512;&#1504;&#1492; (cogn. of &#1512;&#1504;&#1503;), of the rattling of the quiver, as Arab. ranna, ranima, of the whirring of the bow when the arrow is despatched; to point it &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; (<a href="/proverbs/1-20.htm">Proverbs 1:20</a>; <a href="/proverbs/8-3.htm">Proverbs 8:3</a>), instead of &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1504;&#1492;, would be to deprive the language of a word supported by the dialects (vid., Ges. Thes.). On <a href="/job/39-24.htm">Job 39:24</a> we may compare the Arab. iltahama-l-farasu-l-arda, the horse swallows up the ground, whence lahimm, lah&#305;&#770;m, a swallower  equals  swift-runner; so here: with boisterous fierceness and angry impatience (&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1506;&#1513;&#1473; &#1493;&#1512;&#1490;&#1494;) it swallows up the ground, i.e., passes so swiftly over it that long pieces vanish so rapidly before it, as though it greedily sucked them up (&#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1488; intensive of &#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1488;, whence &#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1488;, the water-sucking papyrus); a somewhat differently applied figure is nahab-el-arda, i.e., according to Silius' expression, rapuit campum. The meaning of <a href="/job/39-24.htm">Job 39:24</a> is, as in Virgil, Georg. iii.:83f.:<p>Tum si qua sonum procul arma dedere,<p>Stare loco nescit;<p>and in Aeschylus, Septem, 375: &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#788;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; (Hermann, &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; (impatiently awaiting the call of the trumpet). &#1492;&#1488;&#1502;&#1497;&#1503; signifies here to show stability (vid., Genesis, S. 367f.) in the first physical sense (Bochart, Rosenm., and others): it does not stand still, i.e., will not be held, when (&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, quum) the sound of the war-trumpet, i.e., when it sounds. &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1508;&#1512; is the signal-trumpet when the army was called together, e.g., <a href="/judges/3-27.htm">Judges 3:27</a>; to gather the army that is in pursuit of the enemy, <a href="/2_samuel/2-28.htm">2 Samuel 2:28</a>; when the people rebelled, <a href="/2_samuel/20-1.htm">2 Samuel 20:1</a>; when the army was dismissed at the end of the war, <a href="/2_samuel/20-22.htm">2 Samuel 20:22</a>; when forming for defence and for assault, e.g., <a href="/amos/3-6.htm">Amos 3:6</a>; and in general the signal of war, <a href="/jeremiah/4-19.htm">Jeremiah 4:19</a>. As often as this is heard (&#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;, in sufficiency, i.e., happening at any time  equals  quotiescunque), it makes known its lust of war by a joyous neigh, even from afar, before the collision has taken place; it scents (praesagit according to Pliny's expression) the approaching conflict, (scents even in anticipation) the thundering command of the chiefs that may soon be heard, and the cry of battle giving loose to the assault. "Although," says Layard (New Discoveries, p. 330), "docile as a lamb, and requiring no other guide than the halter, when the Arab mare hears the war-cry of the tribe, and sees the quivering spear of her rider, her eyes glitter with fire, her blood-red nostrils open wide, her neck is nobly arched, and her tail and mane are raised and spread out to the wind. The Bedouin proverb says, that a high-bred mare when at full speed should hide her rider between her neck and her tail." </body></html>
