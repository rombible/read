Behemoth signifies beasts. Most understand it of an animal well known in Egypt, called the river-horse, or hippopotamus. This vast animal is noticed as an argument to humble ourselves before the great God; for he created this vast animal, which is so fearfully and wonderfully made. Whatever strength this or any other creature has, it is derived from God. He that made the soul of man, knows all the ways to it, and can make the sword of justice, his wrath, to approach and touch it. Every godly man has spiritual weapons, the whole armour of God, to resist, yea, to overcome the tempter, that his never-dying soul may be safe, whatever becomes of his frail flesh and mortal body.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/40.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He lieth under the shady trees - Referring to his usually inactive and lazy life. He is disposed to lie down in the shade, and especially in the vegetable growth in marshy places on the banks of lakes and rivers, rather than to dwell in the open field or in the upland forest. This account agrees well with the habits of the hippopotamus. The word here and in <a href="/job/40-22.htm">Job 40:22</a> rendered "shady trees" (&#1510;&#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;  tse'eliym), is by Gesenius, Noyes, Prof. Lee, and Schultens, translated "lotus," and "wild lotus." The Vulgate, Syriac, Rosenmuller, Aben-Ezra, and others, render it "shady trees." It occurs nowhere else in the Scriptures, and it is difficult, therefore, to determine its meaning. According to Schultens and Gesenius, it is derived from the obsolete word &#1510;&#1488;&#1500;  tsa&#772;'al, "to be thin, slender;" and hence, in Arabic it is applied to the "wild lotus" - a plant that grows abundantly on the banks of the Nile, and that often serves the wild beasts of the desert for a place of retreat. It is not very important whether it be rendered the "lotus," or "shades," though the probable derivation of the word seems to favor the former.<p>In the covert of the reed - It is well known that reeds abounded on the banks of the Nile. These would furnish a convenient and a natural retreat for the hippopotamus.<p>And fens - &#1489;&#1510;&#1492;  bitstsa&#770;h - "marsh, marshy places." This passage proves that the elephant is not here referred to. He is never found in such places. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/40.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21. lieth&#8212;He leads an inactive life.<p>shady trees&#8212;rather, "lotus bushes"; as Job 40:22 requires.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/job/40.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The elephant lies down to rest himself; and it is but fabulous which some writers affirm, that they have no joints in their legs, and so cannot lie down, but sleep or rest themselves standing or leaning against a tree; which is denied and confuted by Aristotle in his History of Living Creatures, 2, 4. and by later writers. For the elephant, being a creature naturally hot, and living generally in hot countries, diligently seeks for and delights in shady and waterish places, as is noted by Aristotle, and after him by Pliny and Ælian. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/job/40.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>He lieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed,  <p>and fens. This may be thought to agree very well with the river horse, the inhabitant of the Nile, where reeds in great plenty grew, and adjoining to which were fenny and marshy places, and shady trees; and, as historians relate (e), this creature takes its lodging among high reeds, and in shady places; yea, the reeds and sugar canes, and the leaves of the papyrus, are part of the food on which it lives; and hence the hunters of them sometimes cover their bait with a reed to take them; though it must be allowed that the elephant delights to be about rivers, and in clayey and fenny places (f), and therefore Aelianus (g) says it may be called the fenny animal. <p>(e) Ammian.

The dense shade of trees is sought alike by the hippopotamus and the elephant. <span class="cmt_word">In the covert of the reed, and fens.</span> This is exactly descriptive of the hippopotamus; far less so of the elephant. Gordon Cumming says, "At every turn there occurred deep still pools, and occasional sandy islands, densely clad with lofty reeds Above and beyond these reeds stood trees of immense age. beneath which grew a rank kind of grass, on which the sea-cow (hippopotamus) delights to pasture" ('Lion-Hunter of South Africa,' p. 297). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/40.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>15  Behold now the behmth,<p>Which I have made with thee:<p>He eateth grass like an ox.<p>16  Behold now, his strength is in his loins,<p>And his force in the sinews of his belly.<p>17  He bendeth his tail like a cedar branch,<p>The sinews of his legs are firmly interwoven.<p>18  His bones are like tubes of brass,<p>His bones like bars of iron.<p>&#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; (after the manner of the intensive plur. &#1492;&#1493;&#1500;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514;, &#1495;&#1499;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, which play the part of the abstract termination), which sounds like a plur., but without the numerical plural signification, considered as Hebrew, denotes the beast &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4; &#787; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;, or the giant of beasts, is however Hebraized from the Egyptian p-ehe-mau, (muau), i.e., the (p) ox (ehe) of the water (mau as in the Hebraized proper name &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;). It is, as Bochart has first of all shown, the so-called river or Nile horse, Hippopotamus amphibius (in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/30-6.htm">Isaiah 30:6</a>, &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; &#1504;&#1490;&#1489;, as emblem of Egypt, which extends its power, and still is active in the interest of others), found in the rivers of Africa, but no longer found in the Nile, which is not inappropriately called a horse; the Arab. water-hog is better, Italian bomarino, Eng. sea-cow ?, like the Egyptian p-ehe-mau. The change of p and b in the exchange of Egyptian and Semitic words occurs also elsewhere, e.g., pug' and &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509;, harpu and &#1495;&#1512;&#1489; (&#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;), Apriu and &#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; (according to Lauth). Nevertheless p-ehe-mau (not mau-t, for what should the post-positive fem. art. do here?) is first of all only the &#1489;&#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; translated back again into the Egyptian by Jablonsky; an instance in favour of this is still wanting. In Hieroglyph the Nile-horse is called apet; it was honoured as divine. Brugsch dwelt in Thebes in the temple of the Apet.<p>(Note: In the astronomical representations the hippopotamus is in the neighbourhood of the North Pole in the place of the dragon of the present day, and bears the name of hes-mut, in which mut  equals  t. mau, "the mother."
