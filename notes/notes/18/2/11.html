The preserving so much wisdom and piety among those that were not children of the promise was a happy presage of God’s grace to the Gentiles, when the partition wall should, in the latter days, be taken down.

It would appear that they suspected his unexampled troubles were judgments for some crimes, which he had vailed under his professions of godliness. Many look upon it only as a compliment to visit their friends in sorrow; we must look life. And if the example of Job's friends is not enough to lead us to pity the afflicted, let us seek the mind that was in Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Now when Job's three friends heard - It would seem from this that these men were his particular friends.<p>They came every one from his own place - His residence. This was the result of agreement or appointment thus to meet together.<p>Eliphaz the Temanite - This was the most prominent of his friends. In the ensuing discussion he regularly takes the lead, advances the most important and impressive considerations, and is followed and sustained by the others. The Septuagint renders this &#x395;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3b6; &#x3bf;&#788; &#x398;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2;  Elifaz ho Thaimaino&#772;n basileus - Eliphaz, the king of the Themanites. The Hebrew does not intimate that he held any office or rank. The word rendered "Temanite" &#1514;&#1497;&#1502;&#1504;&#1497;  te&#770;yma&#770;n&#305;&#770;y is a patronymic from &#1514;&#1502;&#1503;  te&#770;ma&#770;n, meaning properly "at the right hand," and then "the South." The Hebrew geographers are always represented as looking to the East, and not toward the North, as we do; and hence, with them, the right hand denotes the South. Teman or Theman was a son of Eliphaz, and grandson of Esau; see <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/36-15.htm">Genesis 36:15</a>, where he is spoken of as "duke" or prince &#1488;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507;  'alu&#770;ph a head of a family or tribe, a chieftain.<p>He is supposed to have lived on the east of Idumea. Eusebius places Thaeman in Arabia Petrara, five miles from Petra (see the notes at <a href="/isaiah/16-1.htm">Isaiah 16:1</a>), and says that there was a Roman garrison there. The Temanites were cclebrated for wisdom. "Is wisdom no more in Teman?" <a href="/jeremiah/49-7.htm">Jeremiah 49:7</a>. The country was distinguished also for producing men of strength: "And thy mighty men, O Teman, shall be dismayed;" <a href="/obadiah/1-9.htm">Obadiah 1:9</a>. That this country was a part of Idumea is apparent, not only from the fact that Teman was a descendant of Esau, who settled there, but from several places in the Scriptures. Thus, in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-13.htm">Ezekiel 25:13</a>, it is said, "I will also stretch out mine hand upon Edom, and I will make it desolate from Toman, and they of Dedan shall fall by the sword." In <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/1-12.htm">Amos 1:12</a>, Teman is mentioned as in the vicinity of Bozrah, at one time the capital of Idumea: "But I will send a fire upon Teman, which shall devour the palaces of Bozrah;" see the notes at <a href="/isaiah/21-14.htm">Isaiah 21:14</a>. The inhabitants of this country were distinguished in early times for wisdom, and particularly for that kind of wisdom which is expressed in close observation of men and manners, and the course of events, and which was expressed in proverbs. Thus, they are mentioned in the book of Baruch, 3:23: "The merchants of Meran and of Theman, the authors of fables, and searchers out of understanding," &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788; &#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;  hoi muthologoi kai hoi ekze&#772;te&#772;tai te&#772;s suneseo&#772;s.<p>And Bildad the Shuhite - The second speaker uniformly in the following argument. The Septuagint renders this, "Bildad the sovereign of the Saucheans," &#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  Saucheo&#772;n turannos. Shuah &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;  shu&#770;ach (meaning a pit) was the name of a son of Abraham, by Keturah, and also of an Arabian tribe, descended from him, <a href="/genesis/25-2.htm">Genesis 25:2</a>. "The country of the Shuhites," says Gesenius, "was not improbably the same with the &#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;  Sakkaia of Ptolemy, v. 15, eastward of Batanea." But the exact situation of the Shubites is unknown. It is difficult to determine the geography of the tribes of Arabia, as many of them are migratory and unsettled. It would seem that Bildad did not reside very far from Eliphaz, for they made an "agreement" to go and visit Job.<p>And Zophar the Naamathite - An inhabitant of Naamah, whose situation is unknown. The Septuagint renders this, "Zophar, king of the Minaians - &#x39c;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;  &#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c2;  Minaio&#772;n basileus. A place by the name of Naamah is mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/15-41.htm">Joshua 15:41</a>, as in the limits of the tribe of Judah. But this was a considerable distance from the residence of Job, and it is not probable that Zophar was far from that region. Conjecture is useless as to the place where he lived. The Editor of the Pictorial Bible, however, supposes that Zophar was from the town in Judah mentioned in <a href="/joshua/15-41.htm">Joshua 15:41</a>. He observes that this town is "mentioned in a list of the uttermost cities of Judah's lot, 'toward the coast of Edom southward; ' it is further among that portion of those towns that lay 'in the valley' <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/15-33.htm">Joshua 15:33</a>, wbich valley is the same that contained Joktheel <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/15-38.htm">Joshua 15:38</a>, which is supposed to have been Petra. Naamah was probably, therefore, in or near the Ghor or valley which extends from the Dead Sea to the Gulf of Akaba. - These considerations," he adds, "seem to establish the conclusion that the scene of this book is laid in the land of Edom." In the first part of this verse, a remarkable addition occurs in the Chaldee paraphrase. - It is as follows: "And the three friends of Job heard of all the evil which had come upon him, and when they saw the trees of his gardens (Chaldean, "Paradise" &#1508;&#1512;&#1491;&#1505;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1503;) that they were dried up, and the bread of his support that it was turned into living flesh (&#1500;&#1489;&#1505;&#1512;&#1488; &#1488;&#1514;&#1492;&#1508;&#1498; &#1505;&#1506;&#1493;&#1491;&#1514;&#1495;&#1493;&#1503; &#1493;&#1500;&#1495;&#1501; &#1495;&#1497;&#1488;), and the wine of his drink turned into blood (&#1488;&#1514;&#1492;&#1508;&#1498; &#1502;&#1513;&#1514;&#1497;&#1495;&#1493;&#1503; &#1493;&#1495;&#1502;&#1512; &#1500;&#1491;&#1502;&#1488;)."<p>Here is evidently the doctrine of "transubstantiation," the change of bread into flesh, and of wine into blood, and bears the marks of having been interpolated by some friend of the papacy. But when or by whom it was done is unknown. It is a most stupid forgery. The evident intention of it was to sustain the doctrine of transubstantiation, by the plea that it was found far back in the times of Job, and that it could not be regarded, therefore, as an absurdity. To what extent it has ever been used by the advocates of that doctrine, I have no means of ascertaining. Its interpolation here is a pretty sure proof of the conviction of the author of it that the doctrine is not found in any fair interpretation of the Bible.<p>For they had made an appointment together - They had agreed to go together, and they evidently set out on the journey together. The Chaldee - or someone who has interpolated a passage in the Chaldee - has introduced a circumstance in regard to the design of their coming, which savors also of the Papacy. It is as follows: "They came each one from his place, and for the merit of this they were freed from the place destined to them in Gehenna," a passage evidently intended to defend the doctrine of "purgatory," by the authority of the ancient Chaldee Paraphrase.<p>To come to mourn with him, and to comfort him - To show the appropriate sympathy of friends in a time of special calamity. They did not come with an intention to reproach him, or to charge him with being a hypocrite. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. Eliphaz&#8212;The view of Rawlinson that "the names of Job's three friends represent the Chaldean times, about 700 B.C.," cannot be accepted. Eliphaz is an Idumean name, Esau's oldest son (Ge 36:4); and Teman, son of Eliphaz (Ge 36:15), called "duke." Eusebius places Teman in Arabia-Petr&aelig;a (but see on [494]Job 6:19). Teman means "at the right hand"; and then the south, namely, part of Idumea; capital of Edom (Am 1:12). Hebrew geographers faced the east, not the north as we do; hence with them "the right hand" was the south. Temanites were famed for wisdom (Jer 49:7). Baruch mentions them as "authors of fables" (namely, proverbs embodying the results of observation), and "searchers out of understanding."<p>Bildad the Shuhite&#8212;Shuah ("a pit"), son of Abraham and Keturah (Ge 25:2).

From the allusions in chaps. 7, 19, and 30, it is probable that a considerable time elapsed. A man of Job’s rank would not choose his friends from the men of inferior station around him; they would be, like himself, Eastern princes, all but his equals in rank and influence. Their abodes would therefore be distant from one another, and more distant from his, and travelling in the East is slow. The tone of Job’s mind, too, as reflected in ch. 3, has undergone a change, the effect, no doubt, of protracted sufferings.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Eliphaz is an old Idumean name (<a href="/genesis/36-4.htm" title="And Adah bore to Esau Eliphaz; and Bashemath bore Reuel;">Genesis 36:4</a>), and Teman, the place of his abode, is frequently mentioned in connexion with Edom.

It is not to be supposed that Job had no more than three friends - indeed, Elihu the Buzzite appears later on as one of his friends (<a href="/job/32-2.htm">Job 32:2-6</a>) - but he had three contemporaries with whom he was especially intimate, old men (<a href="/job/32-6.htm">Job 32:6</a>), with whom he was probably accustomed to confer from time to time, and who were in the habit of giving him their advice. All three, apparently, lived at a distance; and it seems to have been some weeks before the news of his misfortunes reached them. When the news came they held communication one with another, and agreed to pay him visits of condolence at a certain definite time, which was determined upon between them. Some months - at least two - seem to have elapsed between the date of Job's latest affliction and the time of their arrival  (<a href="/job/7-3.htm">Job 7:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">They came every one from his own place</span>. They had separate homes, and probably lived at some considerable distance from one another. Eliphaz the Temanite. There was an Eliphaz, the son of Esau by his wife Adah, who had a son Teman (<a href="/genesis/36-4.htm">Genesis 36:4</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/1-35.htm">1 Chronicles 1:35, 36</a>); but it is not supposed that this can be the person here intended. The name Teman did not become geographical until the descendants of this Eliphaz's son had multiplied into a tribe, when they gave name to the portion of Arabia which they inhabited. This tract seems to have been either a part of Edom, or in its immediate vicinity (<a href="/genesis/36-42.htm">Genesis 36:42, 43</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/49-7.htm">Jeremiah 49:7, 8, 20</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/25-15.htm">Ezekiel 25:15</a>; <a href="/obadiah/1-8.htm">Obadiah 1:8, 9</a>), but cannot be located with accuracy. The Temanitee were celebrated for their wisdom, as we learn from Jeremiah, who says (<a href="/jeremiah/49-7.htm">Jeremiah 49:7</a>), "Concerning Edom, thus saith the Lord of hosts; Is wisdom no more in Teman? is counsel perished from the prudent? is their wisdom vanished?" Job's friend was probably among their wisest men at the time; and his discourses certainly show a considerable knowledge of human nature. They do not, however, solve the riddle of the universe. <span class="cmt_word">And Bildad the Shuhite</span>. Bildad is a name which does not occur elsewhere in Scripture, neither is there any other mention of Shuhites. Conjecture has identified the Shuhites with the Saccaei of Ptolemy ('Geograph.,' 5:15), whom he places in the neighbourhood of Batanaea and Trachonitis. But the Saccaei are unheard of till Ptolemy's time, and seem to be a tribe of very small importance. Perhaps Bildad belonged to the people known to the Assyrians as the Tsukhi, or Sukhi ('Records of the Past,' vol. 1. p. 14), who dwelt on the Middle Euphrates from about Anah to Hit ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. pp. 66, 67). <span class="cmt_word">And Zophar the Naamathite</span>. Zophar, or rather Tsophar, is another unknown name. There was a Naamah, a city, in south-western Judaea (<a href="/joshua/15-41.htm">Joshua 15:41</a>), to which Zophar may have belonged, though probably a region, rather than a city, is here intended. <span class="cmt_word">For they had made an appointment together</span>; or, <span class="accented">agreed together</span>, by message or letter probably. <span class="cmt_word">To come to mourn with him and to comfort him</span>. A good intention, at any rate, and one agreeable to the apostolic injunction to us to "weep with them that weep" (<a href="/romans/12-15.htm">Romans 12:15</a>). That they failed to carry out their intention (<a href="/job/16-2.htm">Job 16:2</a>; <a href="/job/21-34.htm">Job 21:34</a>) was owing to a want of judgment, and, perhaps, in part, to a want of love. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>4, 5  And Satan answered Jehovah, and said, Skin for skin, and all that man hath will he give for his life: stretch forth yet once Thy hand, and touch his bone, and his flesh, truly he will renounce Thee to Thy face.<p>Olshausen refers &#1506;&#1494;&#1512; &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1491; &#1506;&#1494;&#1512; to Job in relation to Jehovah: So long as Thou leavest his skin untouched, he will also leave Thee untouched; which, though it is the devil who speaks, were nevertheless too unbecomingly expressed. Hupfeld understands by the skin, that skin which is here given for the other, - the skin of his cattle, of his servants and children, which Job had gladly given up, that for such a price he might get off with his own skin sound; but &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1491; cannot be used as Beth pretii: even in <a href="/proverbs/6-26.htm">Proverbs 6:26</a> this is not the case. For the same reason, we must not, with Hirz., Ew., and most, translate, Skin for skin  equals  like for like, which Ewald bases on the strange assertion, that one skin is like another, as one dead piece is like another. The meaning of the words of Satan (rightly understood by Schlottm. and the Jewish expositors) is this: One gives up one's skin to preserve one's skin; one endures pain on a sickly part of the skin, for the sake of saving the whole skin; one holds up the arm, as Raschi suggests, to avert the fatal blow from the head. The second clause is climacteric: a man gives skin for skin; but for his life, his highest good, he willingly gives up everything, without exception, that can be given up, and life itself still retained. This principle derived from experience, applied to Job, may be expressed thus: Just so, Job has gladly given up everything, and is content to have escaped with his life. &#1493;&#1488;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501;, verum enim vero, is connected with this suppressed because self-evident application. The verb &#1504;&#1504;&#1506;, above, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/1-11.htm">Job 1:11</a>, with &#1489;&#1468;, is construed here with &#1488;&#1500;, and expresses increased malignity: Stretch forth Thy hand but once to his very bones, etc. Instead of &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1498;, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/1-11.htm">Job 1:11</a>, &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468; is used here with the same force: forthwith, fearlessly and regardlessly (comp. <a href="/job/13-15.htm">Job 13:15</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/7-10.htm">Deuteronomy 7:10</a>), he will bid Thee farewell. </body></html>
