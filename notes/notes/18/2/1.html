How well is it for us, that neither men nor devils are to be our judges! but all our judgment comes from the Lord, who never errs. Job holds fast his integrity still, as his weapon. God speaks with pleasure of the power of his own grace. Self-love and self-preservation are powerful in the hearts of men. But Satan accuses Job, representing him as wholly selfish, and minding nothing but his own ease and safety. Thus are the ways and people of God often falsely blamed by the devil and his agents. Permission is granted to Satan to make trial, but with a limit. If God did not chain up the roaring lion, how soon would he devour us! Job, thus slandered by Satan, was a type of Christ, the first prophecy of whom was, that Satan should bruise his heel, and be foiled.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Again there was a day ... - See the notes at <a href="/job/1-6.htm">Job 1:6</a>.

When good men, professors of religion, met together by agreement to worship the Lord; the Targum calls them companies of angels, interpreting the words of them, and of their standing before the Lord, as most interpreters do; how long this time of their meeting was from the former cannot be said, probably but a few days, a week or fortnight at most; the Targum says, it was on the day of the great judgment, and which, as in <a href="/job/1-6.htm">Job 1:6</a>; was at the beginning of the year; so that according to this, and other Jewish writers, there was a whole year between this and the former meeting, and so between the first and second trial of Job; but this is not likely, since Satan would never give him so much breathing time; nor can it be thought that Job's friends should stay so long before they paid him a visit, which was not till after this day: <p>and Satan came also among them to present himself before the Lord; being either obliged to it upon a summons to appear before God, and give an account of what he had been doing on the earth, and especially to Job; or rather he came willingly, seeking an opportunity to continue his charge against Job, and to accuse him afresh, and get his commission enlarged to do him more mischief, which he could not do without a fresh grant. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Again there was a day when the <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> Satan came also among them to present himself before the LORD.</span><p>(a) That is, the angels, Job 1:6.<p>(b) Read Job 1:6.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/job/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>Ch. <a href="/context/job/2-1.htm" title="Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them to present himself before the LORD....">Job 2:1-10</a>. Job’s second trial and its issue: he sinned not with his lips<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>How long time intervened between Job’s first trial and the second is not stated. The Targum seems to conjecture a year. The new trial is introduced like the first by a scene in heaven. The Council of God convenes. His ministers stand before Him, and among them the one whose office is, as the Targum says, to scrutinize the deeds of men. The Lord speaks of His servant Job with approval and with compassion, reproaching the Satan with instigating Him to bring undeserved affliction upon him. Satan’s answer is ready: the trial did not touch Job near enough; safe himself, his children may perish; if the hand of God would touch him in his own bone and flesh, he would renounce Him to his face. Satan receives permission to afflict Job himself, with the reservation that he shall spare his life. Straightway Satan goes forth and smites Job with sore boils, the leprosy called Elephantiasis or botch of Egypt, <a href="/deuteronomy/28-27.htm" title="The LORD will smite you with the botch of Egypt, and with the tumors, and with the scab, and with the itch, whereof you can not be healed.">Deuteronomy 28:27</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/28-35.htm" title="The LORD shall smite you in the knees, and in the legs, with a sore botch that cannot be healed, from the sole of your foot to the top of your head.">Deuteronomy 28:35</a>. The deeper affliction only opens or reveals greater deeps in Job’s reverent piety. In his former trial he blessed God who took away the good He had added to naked man; this was strictly no evil: now he bows beneath His hand when He inflicts positive evil, “We receive good at the hand of God and shall we not also receive evil?” And again the Writer sums up the issue of the trial with the words, “In all this Job sinned not.”<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-13.</span> - This chapter concludes the "Introductory section." It consists of three parts. Vers. 1-6 contain an account of Satan's second appearance in the courts of heaven, and of a second colloquy between him and the Almighty. Vers. 7-10 contain the sequel to this colloquy, viz. Satan's further affliction of Job, and his conduct under it. Vers. 11-13 contain an account of the arrival of Job's three special friends to mourn with him and to comfort him; and of their behavior during the first seven days after their arrival <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Again there was a day when the sons of God same to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan came also among them</span>. There is no "again" in the original. The words used are an exact repetition of those contained in ver. 6 of ch. 1. But they mark, no doubt, a <span class="accented">second</span> occasion on which  the angelic host came to present themselves before the throne of God, and Satan came with them. <span class="cmt_word">To present himself before the Lord</span>. These words are additional to those used in the former passage. We may gather from them, that, whereas on the former occasion Satan came only to observe, and with no intention of drawing God's special attention to himself, he now had such intention, and looked forward to a colloquy. He anticipated, doubtless, that the circumstances of Job's probation would be referred to, and he had prepared himself to make answer. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Third Messenger:<p>17  While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans ranged themselves in three bands, and rushed upon the camels, and carried them away, and slew the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.<p>Without any authority, Ewald sees in this mention of the Chaldeans an indication of the composition of the book in the seventh century b.c., when the Chaldeans under Nabopolassar began to inherit the Assyrian power.
