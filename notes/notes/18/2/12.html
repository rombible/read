Much of the comfort of this life lies in friendship with the prudent and virtuous. Coming to mourn with him, they vented grief which they really felt. Coming to comfort him, they sat down with him. It would appear that they suspected his unexampled troubles were judgments for some crimes, which he had vailed under his professions of godliness. Many look upon it only as a compliment to visit their friends in sorrow; we must look life. And if the example of Job's friends is not enough to lead us to pity the afflicted, let us seek the mind that was in Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And when they lifted up their eyes afar off - "When they saw him at the distance at which they could formerly recognize him without difficulty, disease had so altered his appearance that at first sight they knew him not" - Noyes.<p>They lifted up their voice - This is a common expression in the Scriptures, to denote grief; <a href="/genesis/27-38.htm">Genesis 27:38</a>; <a href="/genesis/29-11.htm">Genesis 29:11</a>; <a href="/judges/2-4.htm">Judges 2:4</a>; <a href="/ruth/1-9.htm">Ruth 1:9</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-16.htm">1 Samuel 24:16</a>, "et soepe al." We learn to suppress the expressions of grief. The ancients gave vent to their sorrows aloud. - They even hired persons to aid them in their lamentations; and it became a professional business of women to devote themselves to the office of making an outcry on occasions of mourning. The same thing prevails in the East at present. Friends sit around the grave of the dead, or go there at different times, and give a long and doleful shriek or howl, as expressive of their grief.<p>And they rent every one his mantle - See the notes at <a href="/job/1-20.htm">Job 1:20</a>.<p>And sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven - Another expression of sorrow; compare <a href="/lamentations/2-10.htm">Lamentations 2:10</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/9-1.htm">Nehemiah 9:1</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/4-12.htm">1 Samuel 4:12</a>; <a href="/joshua/7-6.htm">Joshua 7:6</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/27-30.htm">Ezekiel 27:30</a>. Thc indications of grief here referred to, were such as were common in ancient times. They resemble, in a remarkable manner, the mode in which Achilles gave utterance to his sorrow, when informed of the death of Patroclus.
