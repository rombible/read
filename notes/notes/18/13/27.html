There is a difficulty in these two verses, arising from the pronouns. Some understand the subject to be the fetter: “Thou puttest my feet in the fetter that watcheth over all my paths, and imprinteth itself upon the roots of my feet, and it (the foot) consumeth like a rotten thing, and like a garment that is moth-eaten.” Others refer the “he” to Job himself; and others to man, the subject of the following chapter. In the Hebrew future tense the third person feminine and the second person masculine are alike, and the word for fetter, which is only found here and at <a href="/job/33-11.htm" title="He puts my feet in the stocks, he marks all my paths.">Job 33:11</a>, where Elihu quotes these words, may possibly be feminine in this place, though it is clear that Elihu understood Job to be speaking of God.

Bishop Patrick’s paraphrase here is, “I can no more escape than a malefactor, whose feet are in the stocks, who is encompassed with a vigilant guard, and cannot stir a foot from the place where he is.” Heath thinks there is an allusion, in these words, to the custom of putting a clog on the feet of fugitive slaves, that they might be tracked and found.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/job/13.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>13:23-28 Job begs to have his sins discovered to him. A true penitent is willing to know the worst of himself; and we should all desire to know what our transgressions are, that we may confess them, and guard against them for the future. Job complains sorrowfully of God's severe dealings with him. Time does not wear out the guilt of sin. When God writes bitter things against us, his design is to make us bring forgotten sins to mind, and so to bring us to repent of them, as to break us off from them. Let young persons beware of indulging in sin. Even in this world they may so possess the sins of their youth, as to have months of sorrow for moments of pleasure. Their wisdom is to remember their Creator in their early days, that they may have assured hope, and sweet peace of conscience, as the solace of their declining years. Job also complains that his present mistakes are strictly noticed. So far from this, God deals not with us according to our deserts. This was the language of Job's melancholy views. If God marks our steps, and narrowly examines our paths, in judgment, both body and soul feel his righteous vengeance. This will be the awful case of unbelievers, yet there is salvation devised, provided, and made known in Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks - The word rendered "stocks" (&#1505;&#1491;  sad), denotes the wooden frame or block in which the feet of a person were confined for punishment. The whole passage here is designed to describe the feet; as so confined in a clog or clogs, as to preclude the power of motion. Stocks or clogs were used often in ancient times as a mode of punishment. <a href="/proverbs/7-22.htm">Proverbs 7:22</a>. Jeremiah was punished by being confined in the stocks. <a href="/jeremiah/20-2.htm">Jeremiah 20:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-2.htm">Jeremiah 29:2</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/29-6.htm">Jeremiah 29:6</a>. Paul and Silas were in like manner confined in the prison in stocks; <a href="/acts/16-24.htm">Acts 16:24</a>. Stocks appear to have been of two kinds. They were either clogs attached to one foot or to both feet, so as to embarrass, but not entirely to prevent walking, or they were fixed frames to which the feet were attached so as entirely to preclude motion. The former were often used with runaway slaves to prevent their escaping again when taken, or were affixed to prisoners to prevent their escape. The fixed kinds - which are probably referred to here - were of different sorts. They consisted of a frame, with holes for the feet only; or for the feet and the hands; or for the feet, the hands, and the neck. At Pompeii, stocks have been found so contrived that ten prisoners might be chained by the leg, each leg separately by the sliding of a bar. "Pict. Bible." The instrument is still used in India, and is such as to confine the limbs in a very distressing position, though the head is allowed to move freely.<p>And lookest narrowly unto all my paths - This idea occurs also in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/33-11.htm">Job 33:11</a>, though expressed somewhat differently, "He putteth my feet in the stocks, he marketh all my paths." Probably the allusion is to the paths by which he might escape. God watched or observed every way - as a sentinel or guard would a prisoner who was hampered or clogged, and who would make an attempt to escape.<p>Thou settest a print upon the heels of my feet - Margin, "roots." Such also is the Hebrew - &#1512;&#1490;&#1500;&#1497;  &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;  shereshy regely. Vulgate, "vestigia." Septuagint, "Upon the roots - &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;  eis de rizas - of my feet thou comest." The word &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;  sha&#770;rash means properly "root;" then the "bottom," or the lower part of a thing; and hence, the soles of the feet. The word rendered" settest a print," from &#1495;&#1511;&#1492;  cha&#770;qa&#770;h, means to cut in, to hew, to hack; then to engrave, carve, delineate, portray; then to dig. Various interpretations have been given of the passage here. Gesenius supposes it to mean, "Around the roots of my feet thou hast digged," that is, hast made a trench so that I can get no further. But though this suits the connection, yet it is an improbable interpretation. It is not the way in which one would endeavor to secure a prisoner, to make a ditch over which he could not leap.<p>Others render it, "Around the soles of my feet thou hast drawn lines," that is, thou hast made marks how far I may go. Dr. Good supposes that the whole description refers to some method of clogging a wild animal for the purpose of taming him, and that the expression here refers to a mark on the hoof of the animal by which the owner could designate him. Noyes accords with Gesenius. The editor of the Pictorial Bible supposes that it may refer to the manner in which the stocks were made, and that it means that a seal was affixed to the parts of the plank of which they were constructed, when they were joined together. He adds that the Chinese have a portable pillory of this kind, and that offenders are obliged to wear it around their necks for a given period, and that over the place where it is joined together a piece of paper is pasted, that it may not be opened without detection. Rosenmuller supposes that it means, that Job was confined within certain prescribed limits, beyond which he was not allowed to go. This restraint he supposes was effected by binding his feet by a cord to the stocks, so that he was not allowed to go beyond a certain distance. The general sense is clear, that Job was confined within certain limits, and was observed with very marked vigilance. But I doubt whether either of the explanations suggested is the true one. Probably some custom is alluded to of which we have no knowledge now - some mark that was affixed to the feet to prevent a prisoner from escaping without being detected. What that was, I think, we do not know. Perhaps Oriental researches will yet disclose some custom that will explain it. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>27. stocks&#8212;in which the prisoner's feet were made fast until the time of execution (Jer 20:2).<p>lookest narrowly&#8212;as an overseer would watch a prisoner.<p>print&#8212;Either the stocks, or his disease, marked his soles (Hebrew, "roots") as the bastinado would.

Which is one kind of punishment of offenders, and a preservation of them from making their escape; and is a security and reservation of them for further punishment sometimes; and so Job looked upon his afflictions as a punishment for he knew not what, and with which he was so surrounded and enclosed, that there was no getting out of them any more than a man can whose feet are set fast in the stocks; and that he was here kept for greater afflictions still, which he dreaded. Aben Ezra interprets it, "thou puttest my feet in lime"; and this is followed by others (n), suggesting, as a man's steps in lime are marked and easily discerned, so were his by the Lord; but this seems to be foreign from the mind of Job, who would not make such a concession as this, as if his steps taken amiss were so visible: <p>and lookest narrowly into all my paths; so that there was no possibility of escaping out of his troubles and afflictions; so strict a watch was kept over him; see <a href="/job/7-19.htm">Job 7:19</a>; according to Ben Gersom, this refers to the stocks, "it keeps all my ways", kept him within from going abroad about the business of life, and so may refer to the disease of his body, his boils and ulcers, which kept him at home, and suffered him not to stir out of doors; but the former sense is best: <p>thou settest a print upon the heels of my feet; either it, the stocks, made a mark upon his heels, with which they were pressed hard, as Gersom; or rather God set one upon them, afflicting him very sorely and putting him to an excruciating pain, such as is felt by criminals when heavy blows are laid upon the soles of their feet, to which the allusion may be; or else the sense is, that he followed him closely by the heels, that whenever he took a step, it was immediately marked, and observed by the Lord, as if he trod in his steps, and set his own foot in the mark that was left. <p>(n) "Calce tinxisti pedes meos", Gussetius, p. 550. so some in Ben Melech. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/13.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Thou puttest my feet also in the <span class="cverse3">{n}</span> stocks, and lookest narrowly unto all my paths; thou settest a print upon the heels of my feet.</span><p>(n) You make me your prisoner, and so press me that I cannot stir hand or foot.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/job/13.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">27</span>. <span class="ital">Thou puttest</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">and puttest my feet in</span> &c. The verse describes his afflictions under three figures, all denoting arrest, impossibility of movement or escape, and chastisement. The first words are brought up by Elihu, ch. <a href="/job/33-11.htm" title="He puts my feet in the stocks, he marks all my paths.">Job 33:11</a>, cf. <a href="/jeremiah/20-2.htm" title="Then Pashur smote Jeremiah the prophet, and put him in the stocks that were in the high gate of Benjamin, which was by the house of the LORD.">Jeremiah 20:2</a>; <a href="/acts/16-24.htm" title="Who, having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks.">Acts 16:24</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">settest a print upon the heels</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">and drawest thee a line around the soles</span> of my feet.

The punishment is said to be still in use among the Bedouin Arabs. It was well known to the Israelites (<a href="/proverbs/7-22.htm">Proverbs 7:22</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/20-2.htm">Jeremiah 20:2</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/29-26.htm">Jeremiah 29:26</a>), to the Greeks (Herod., 9:87), and to the Romans (<a href="/acts/16-24.htm">Acts 16:24</a>).

The chastening hand of God is generally called &#1497;&#1491; elsewhere; but in spite of this prevalent usage of the language, &#1499;&#1468;&#1507; cannot be understood here (comp. on the contrary <a href="/job/33-7.htm">Job 33:7</a>) otherwise than of the hand (<a href="/job/9-34.htm">Job 9:34</a> : the rod) of God, which lies heavily on Job. The painful pressure of that hand would prevent the collecting and ordering of his thoughts required for meeting with God, and the &#1488;&#1497;&#1502;&#1492; (Codd. defectively &#1488;&#1502;&#1514;&#1498;) of God would completely crush and confound him. But if God grants these two things: to remove His hand for a time, and not to turn the terrible side of His majesty to him, then he is ready whether God should himself open the cause or permit him to have the first word. Correctly Mercerus: optionem ei dat ut aut actoris aut rei personam deligat, sua fretus innocentia, sed interim sui oblitus et immodicus. In contrast with God he feels himself to be a poor worm, but his consciousness of innocence makes him a Titan.<p>He now says what he would ask God; or rather, he now asks Him, since he vividly pictures to himself the action with God which he desires. His imagination anticipates the reality of that which is longed for. Modern expositors begin a new division at <a href="/job/13-23.htm">Job 13:23</a>. But Job's speech does not yet take a new turn; it goes on further continually uno tenore. </body></html>
