He depended upon God for justification and salvation, the two great things we hope for through Christ. Temporal salvation he little expected, but of his eternal salvation he was very confident; that God would not only be his Saviour to make him happy, but his salvation, in the sight and enjoyment of whom he should be happy. He knew himself not to be a hypocrite, and concluded that he should not be rejected. We should be well pleased with God as a Friend, even when he seems against us as an enemy. We must believe that all shall work for good to us, even when all seems to make against us. We must cleave to God, yea, though we cannot for the present find comfort in him. In a dying hour, we must derive from him living comforts; and this is to trust in him, though he slay us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Though he slay me - "God may so multiply my sorrows and pains that I cannot survive them. I see that I may be exposed to increased calamities, yet I am willing to meet them. If in maintaining my own cause, and showing that I am not a hypocrite <a href="//biblehub.com/job/13-16.htm">Job 13:16</a>, it should so happen that my sufferings should be so increased that I should die, yet I will do it." The word "slay," or "kill," here refers to temporal death. It has no reference to punishment in the future world, or to the death of the soul. It means merely that Job was determined to maintain his cause and defend his character, though his sufferings should be so increased that life would be the forfeit. Such was the extent of his sufferings, that he had reason to suppose that they would terminate in death; and yet notwithstanding this, it was his fixed purpose to confide in God; compare the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/job/19-25.htm">Job 19:25-27</a>. This was spoken in Job's better moments, and was his deliberate and prevailing intention. This deliberate purpose expresses what was really the character of the man, though occasionally, when he became impatient, he gave utterance to different sentiments and feelings. We are to look to the prevailing and habitual tenor of a man's feelings and declared principles, in order to determine what his character is, and not to expressions made under the influence of temptation, or under the severity of pain. On the sentiment here expressed, compare <a href="/psalms/23-4.htm">Psalm 23:4</a>; <a href="/proverbs/14-32.htm">Proverbs 14:32</a>.<p>Yet will I trust in him - The word used here (&#1497;&#1495;&#1500;  ya&#770;chal) means properly to wait, stay, delay; and it usually conveys the idea of waiting on one with an expectation of aid or help. Hence, it means to hope. The sense here is, that his expectation or hope was in God; and if the sense expressed in our common version be correct, it implies that even in death, or after death, he would confide in God. He would adhere to him, and would still feel that beyond death he would bless him.<p>In him - In God. But there is here an important variation in the reading. The present Hebrew is &#1500;&#1488;  lo' - "not." The Qeriy or marginal reading, is with a &#1493;  (v) - "in him." Jerome renders it as if it were &#1500;&#1493;  lo&#770; - "in ipso," that is, in him. The Septuagint followed some reading which does not now appear in any copies of the Hebrew text, or which was the result of mere imagination: "Though the Almighty, as he hath begun, may subdue me - &#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;  cheiro&#772;setai - yet will I speak, and maintain my cause before him." The Chaldee renders it, &#1488;&#1510;&#1500;&#1497; &#1511;&#1491;&#1502;&#1493;&#1497; - I will pray before him; evidently reading it as if it were &#1500;&#1493;  lo&#770;, "in him." So the Syriac, in him. I have no doubt, therefore, that this was the ancient reading, and that the true sense is retained in our common version though Rosenmuller, Good, Noyes, and others, have adopted the other reading, and suppose that it is to be taken as a negative.<p>Noyes renders it," Lo! he slayeth me, and I have no hope!" Good, much worse, "Should he even slay me, I would not delay." It may be added, that there are frequent instances where &#1500;&#1488;  lo' and &#1500;&#1493;  lo&#770; are interchanged, and where the copyist seems to have been determined by the sound rather than by a careful inspection of the letters. According to the Masoretes, there are fifteen places where &#1500;&#1488;  lo', "not," is written for &#1500;&#1493;  lo&#770;, "to him." <a href="/exodus/21-8.htm">Exodus 21:8</a>; <a href="/leviticus/11-21.htm">Leviticus 11:21</a>; <a href="/leviticus/25-30.htm">Leviticus 25:30</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/2-3.htm">1 Samuel 2:3</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/16-18.htm">2 Samuel 16:18</a>; <a href="/psalms/100-4.htm">Psalm 100:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/139-16.htm">Psalm 139:16</a>; <a href="/job/13-15.htm">Job 13:15</a>; <a href="/job/41-4.htm">Job 41:4</a>; <a href="/ezra/4-2.htm">Ezra 4:2</a>; <a href="/proverbs/19-7.htm">Proverbs 19:7</a>; <a href="/proverbs/26-2.htm">Proverbs 26:2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/9-2.htm">Isaiah 9:2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/63-9.htm">Isaiah 63:9</a>. On the other hand, &#1500;&#1493;  lo&#770;  is put for &#1500;&#1488;  lo' in <a href="/1_samuel/2-16.htm">1 Samuel 2:16</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/20-2.htm">1 Samuel 20:2</a>; <a href="/job/6-21.htm">Job 6:21</a>. A mistake of this kind may have easily occurred here. The sentiment here expressed is one of the noblest that could fall from the lips of man. It indicates unwavering confidence in God, even in death.<p>It is the determination of a mind to adhere to him, though he should strip away comfort after comfort, and though there should be no respite to his sorrows until he should sink down in death. This is the highest expression of piety, and thus it is the privilege of the friends of God to experience. When professed earthly friends become cold toward us, our love for them also is chilled. Should they leave and forsake us in the midst of suffering and want, and especially should they leave us on a bed of death, we should cease to confide in them. But not so in respect to God. Such is the nature of our confidence in him, that though he takes away comfort after comfort, though our health is destroyed and our friends are removed, and though we are led down into the valley and the shadow of death, yet still we never lose our confidence in him. We feel that all will yet be well. We look forward to another state, and anticipate the blessedness of another and a better world.<p>Reader, can you in sincerity lift the eye toward God, and say to him, "Though Thou dost slay me, though comfort after comfort is taken away, though the waves of trouble roll over me, and though I go down into the valley of the shadow of death, yet i will trust in thee; - Thine I will be even then, and when all is dark I will believe that God is right, and just, and true, and good, and will never doubt that he is worthy of my eternal affection and praise?" Such is religion. Where else is it found but in the views of God and of his government which the Bible reveals. The infidel may have apathy in his sufferings, the blasphemer may be stupid, the moralist or the formalist may be unconcerned; but that is not to have confidence in God. That results from religion alone.<p>But I will maintain mine own ways before him - Margin, "prove," or "argue." The sense is, I will "vindicate" my ways, or myself. That is, I will maintain that I am his friend, and that I am not a hypocrite. His friends charged him with insincerity. They were not able, Job supposed, to appreciate his arguments and to do justice to him. He had, therefore, expressed the wish to carry his cause directly before God <a href="/job/13-3.htm">Job 13:3</a>; and he was assured that he would do justice to his arguments. Even should he slay him, he would still stand up as his friend, and would still maintain that his calamities had not come upon him, as his friends supposed, because he was a hypocrite and a secret enemy of his Maker. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15. in him&#8212;So the margin or keri, reads.

There is a double reading of these words; the "Keri", or marginal reading, is  "in him", which we follow; the "Cetib", or textual reading, is  "not", which many follow, and render the words, "lo, he will slay me, I shall not hope"; or, "I have no hope", or "do not expect" (m) that is, any other than to be slain or die; and this agrees with various expressions of his elsewhere, that he had no hope of any long continuance of life, or of restoration to health and outward happiness again, but expected to die quickly; see <a href="/job/6-11.htm">Job 6:11</a>; <p>but I will maintain mine own ways before him; or "to his face" (n); though I die on the spot instantly, I will stand by it, and make it appear that the ways I have walked in are right, that I have behaved as a sincere upright man, a man fearing God, and eschewing evil; a character which God himself has given of me, and I have not forfeited it: "I will argue" or "prove" (o) it before him, as it may be rendered; that my life and conversation has been agreeable to my profession of him; that my ways have been according to his revealed will, and my walk as becoming the character I bear; and this I will maintain and support as long as I live; I will never depart from this sentiment, or let go my integrity to my latest breath; see <a href="/job/27-5.htm">Job 27:5</a>; but the marginal reading seems best, "yet will I trust in him" (p)? verily I will, though I am under cutting and slaying providences, under sore afflictions, which may be called killing and slaying, or death itself; though there is an addition of them, one affliction upon another, and sorrow upon sorrow; though I am killed continually, all the day long, or die by inches; yea, though in the article of death itself, yet even then "will I trust" and hope: God only is the object of trust and confidence, and not a creature, or any creature enjoyment, or creature act; and great encouragement there is to trust in him, seeing in him is everlasting strength, to fulfil his promises, to help in time of need, and to save with an everlasting salvation; he is to be trusted in at all times, in times of affliction, temptation, desertion, and death itself: it may be rendered (q), "I will hope in him", since there is mercy and plenteous redemption with him, and he delights in those that hope in his mercy; his eye is upon them, and his heart is towards them: or "I will wait for him", or "expect him" (r); wait for deliverance by him, wait all the days of his appointed time, till his change come; wait for the hope of righteousness by faith, expect all needful grace from him now, and eternal glory and happiness hereafter: "but" notwithstanding his trust was alone in God for time and eternity, yet, says he, "I will maintain mine own ways before him"; that I am not an hypocrite, or have behaved as a bad man; but have acted under the influence of grace, according to his mind and will revealed. <p>(m) "Non sperabo", Pagninus, Montanus, Vatablus.

These two clauses are in close connexion, and the words “I will not wait” are almost parenthetical—behold he will slay me (I will not wait for a more distant death), notwithstanding I will defend, &c. Others refer the words “behold he will slay me” to Job’s certainty of speedy death from his disease. And again, some render the words “I will not wait,” <span class="ital">I have no hope</span>; and thus a variety of meanings all more or less suitable arises. The word <span class="ital">to wait</span> hardly has the sense of <span class="ital">to hope</span>, at least in this Book, cf. ch. <a href="/job/6-11.htm" title="What is my strength, that I should hope? and what is my end, that I should prolong my life?">Job 6:11</a>, <a href="/job/14-14.htm" title="If a man die, shall he live again? all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come.">Job 14:14</a>, <a href="/job/29-21.htm" title="To me men gave ear, and waited, and kept silence at my counsel.">Job 29:21</a>, <a href="/job/30-26.htm" title="When I looked for good, then evil came to me: and when I waited for light, there came darkness.">Job 30:26</a>, and in another form in the mouth of Elihu, ch. <a href="/job/32-11.htm" title="Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons, whilst you searched out what to say.">Job 32:11</a>; <a href="/job/32-16.htm" title="When I had waited, (for they spoke not, but stood still, and answered no more;)">Job 32:16</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Instead of the word <span class="ital">not</span> before <span class="ital">wait</span> another reading gives <span class="ital">for him</span>, or <span class="ital">for it</span>.

They set themselves up as God's advocates (&#1500;&#1488;&#1500; &#1512;&#1497;&#1489;, like &#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500; &#1512;&#1497;&#1489;, <a href="/judges/6-31.htm">Judges 6:31</a>), and at the same time accept His person, accipiunt (as in acceptus  equals  gratus), or lift it up, i.e., favour, or give preference to, His person, viz., at the expense of the truth: they are partial in His favour, as they are twice reminded and given to understand by the fut. energicum &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;.

They know that Job is not a flagrant sinner; nevertheless they deceive themselves with the idea that he is, and by reason of this delusion they take up the cause of God against him. Such perversion of the truth in majorem Dei gloriam is an abomination to God. When He searches them, His advocates, out (&#1495;&#1511;&#1512;, as Prov.Job 28:11), they will become conscious of it; or will God be mocked, as one mocketh mortal men? Comp. <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a> for a similar thought. &#1495;&#1514;&#1500; is inf. absol. after the form &#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1500;&#1468;, and &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1514;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; is also to be derived from &#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1500;&#1468;, and is fut. Hiph., the preformative not being syncopated, for &#1514;&#1468;&#1514;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; (Ges. 53, rem. 7); not Piel, from &#1492;&#1514;&#1500; (as <a href="/1_kings/18-27.htm">1 Kings 18:27</a>), with the doubling of the middle radical resolved (Olsh. in his Lehrb. S. 577). God is not pleased with &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; (<a href="/john/16-2.htm">John 16:2</a>) which gives the honour to Him, but not to truth, such &#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3bb; &#787; &#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#787; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4; &#787; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; (<a href="/romans/10-2.htm">Romans 10:2</a>), such advocacy contrary to one's better knowledge and conscience, in which the end is thought to sanctify the means. Such advocacy must be put to shame and confounded when He who needs no concealment of the truth for His justification is manifest in His &#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1514;, i.e., not: in the kindling of His wrath (after <a href="/judges/20-38.htm">Judges 20:38</a>; <a href="/isaiah/30-27.htm">Isaiah 30:27</a>), but: in His exaltation (correctly by Ralbag: &#1492;&#1514;&#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;&#1493; &#1493;&#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;&#1493;), and by His direct influence brings all untruth to light. It is the boldest thought imaginable, that one dare not have respect even to the person of God when one is obliged to lie to one's self. And still it is also self-evident. For God and truth can never be antagonistic. </body></html>
