Those who dispute are tempted to magnify themselves, and lower their brethren, more than is fit. When dismayed or distressed with the fear of wrath, the force of temptation, or the weight of affliction, we should apply to the Physician of our souls, who never rejects any, never prescribes amiss, and never leaves any case uncured. To Him we may speak at all times. To broken hearts and wounded consciences, all creatures, without Christ, are physicians of no value. Job evidently speaks with a very angry spirit against his friends. They had advanced some truths which nearly concerned Job, but the heart unhumbled before God, never meekly receives the reproofs of men.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He will surely reprove you, if ye do secretly accept persons - If you show partiality, you will incur his disapprobation. This seems to have much era proverbial cast, and to mean that under no possible circumstances was it right to show partiality. No matter for whom it may be done, it will be displeasing to God. Even if it be in favor of the righteous, the widow, the fatherless, or of himself, if there is not a disposition to judge according to truth and evidence, God will frown upon you. No matter who the parties might be; no matter what their rank; no matter what friendship there might be for one or the other of them, it was never to be assumed that one was right and the other wrong without evidence. The exact truth was to be sought after, and the judgement made up accordingly. Even when God was one of the parties, the same course was to be pursued. His character was capable of being successfully vindicated, and he would not be pleased to have his cause defended or decided by partiality, or by mere favor. Hence, he encourages people to bring forth their strong reasons, and to adduce all that can be said against his government and laws.

Or "in reproving he will reprove you" (r); he will certainly do it, it may be depended upon, and be expected; he will never suffer sin to go unreproved and uncorrected; he will do it to the purpose, with sharpness and severity, as the nature of the crime requires; he reproves by his spirit, and it is well for men when he thoroughly, and in a spiritual and saving way, reproves them by him, and convinces them of sin, righteousness, and judgment; and he reproves by his word, which is written for reproof and correction; and by his ministers, one part of whose work it is to rebuke and reprove men for bad practices, and bad principles; and in some cases they are to use sharpness, and which when submitted to, and kindly taken, it is well; and sometimes he reproves by his providences, by afflictive dispensations, and that either in love, as he rebukes his own children, or in wrath and hot displeasure, as others, which is here designed; and as it is always for sin he rebukes men, so particularly he rebukes for the following, as might be expected: <p>if ye do secretly accept persons; acceptance of persons in judgment is prohibited by God, and is highly resented by him; yea, even the acceptance of his own person to the prejudice of the character of an innocent man; which seems to be what Job has respect unto, as appears from <a href="/job/13-8.htm">Job 13:8</a>; and some versions render it, "if ye accept his face" (a); and though this may be done no openly and publicly, but in a covert and secret manner, under disguise, and with specious pretences to the honour and glory of God. <p>(r)  "arguiendo arguet", Pagninus, Montanus, Munster, Bolducius, Mercerus, Cocceius, Schmidt; "redarguendo redarguet", Michaelis.

True, he has said in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/9.htm">Job 9</a> that no one can maintain his cause before God; but his confidence in God grows in proportion as his distrust of the friends increases; and at the same time, the hope is begotten that God will grant him that softening of the terror of His majesty which he has reserved to himself in connection with this declaration (<a href="//biblehub.com/job/9-34.htm">Job 9:34</a>, comp. <a href="/job/13-20.htm">Job 13:20</a>.). The infin. absol. &#1492;&#1493;&#1499;&#1495;, which in <a href="/job/6-25.htm">Job 6:25</a> is used almost as a substantive, and indeed as the subject, is here in the place of the object, as e.g., <a href="/isaiah/5-5.htm">Isaiah 5:5</a>; <a href="/isaiah/58-6.htm">Isaiah 58:6</a> : to prove, i.e., my cause, to God (&#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1500;, like <a href="//biblehub.com/job/13-15.htm">Job 13:15</a>, &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493;) I long. With &#1493;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1501; (<a href="/job/13-4.htm">Job 13:4</a>) the antithesis is introduced anew: I will turn to God, you on the contrary (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768;). Since the verb &#1496;&#1508;&#1500;, from its primary meaning to spread on, smear on (whence e.g., Talmudic &#1496;&#1508;&#1500;&#1492;, the act of throwing on, as when plastering up the cracks of an oven), cogn. &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1500; (whence &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1500;, plaster, and perhaps also in the signification tasteless, <a href="/job/6-6.htm">Job 6:6</a>  equals  sticky, greasy, slimy), does not signify, at least not at first, consuere, but assuere (without any relation of root with &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1512;), we explain, not with Olshausen and others, concinnatores mendacii, such as sew together lies as patchwork; but with Hirzel and others, assutores mendacii, such as patch on lies, i.e., charge falsely, since they desire throughout to make him out to be a sinner punished according to his desert. This explanation is also confirmed by <a href="/job/14-17.htm">Job 14:17</a>. Another explanation is given by Hupfeld: sarcinatores false  equals  inanes, inutiles, so that &#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1512; signifies what lies  equals  what deceives, as in the parallel member of the verse &#1488;&#1500;&#1500;, <p>(Note: In the Talmudic, the jugular vein, the cutting of which produces death, is called &#1488;&#1500;&#1500; (later &#1506;&#1510;&#1489;, Arab. &#8219;s&#803;b), according to which (b. Chullin 121a) it is explained: healer of the jugular artery, i.e., those who try to heal what is incurable, therefore charlatans, - a strange idea, which has arisen from the defective form of writing &#1488;&#1500;&#1500;. The lxx translates &#x3b9;&#787;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;.)<p>nothingness, and also &#1506;&#1502;&#1500; (<a href="/job/16-2.htm">Job 16:2</a>) in a similar connection, is not an objective but attributive genitive; but <a href="/psalms/119-69.htm">Psalm 119:69</a> is decisive against this interpretation of &#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1512; &#1496;&#1508;&#1500;&#1497;. The parallelism is not so exactly adjusted, as e.g., even &#1512;&#1508;&#1488;&#1497; does not on account of the parallel with &#1496;&#1508;&#1500;&#1497; signify patchers, &#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, but: they are not able to heal Job's wounds with the medicine of consolation; they are medici nihili, useless physicians. <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/17-28.htm">Proverbs 17:28</a>, "Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise," applies to them, si tacuisses, sapiens mansisses; or, as a rabbinical proverb of similar meaning, quoted by Heidenheim, says, &#1492;&#1513;&#1474;&#1490;&#1492; &#1489;&#1492;&#1513;&#1474;&#1490;&#1492; &#1492;&#1500;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;, "the fatigue of comprehension is comprehension," i.e., the silent pause before a problem is half the solution. The jussive form &#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1492;&#1497;, it would be (Ges. 128, 2), is used in the conclusion of the wish. Thus he challenges them to hear his &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1499;&#1495;&#1514; (&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1499;&#1495;&#1492;) and his &#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1492;. Hirzel is quite right when he says the former does not mean defence (justification), nor the latter proofs (counter-evidence); &#1514;&#1493;&#1499;&#1495;&#1514; is, according to his signification (significatus, in distinction from sensus), &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, correptio (lxx, Vulg.), and here not so much refutation and answer, as correction in an ethical sense, in correspondence with which &#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; is also intended of reproaches, reproofs, or reprimands. </body></html>
