He depended upon God for justification and salvation, the two great things we hope for through Christ. Temporal salvation he little expected, but of his eternal salvation he was very confident; that God would not only be his Saviour to make him happy, but his salvation, in the sight and enjoyment of whom he should be happy. He knew himself not to be a hypocrite, and concluded that he should not be rejected. We should be well pleased with God as a Friend, even when he seems against us as an enemy. We must believe that all shall work for good to us, even when all seems to make against us. We must cleave to God, yea, though we cannot for the present find comfort in him. In a dying hour, we must derive from him living comforts; and this is to trust in him, though he slay us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Who is he that will plead with me? - That is, "who is there now that will take up the cause, and enter into an argument against me?

I am confident of a sucessful issue, and await calmly the divine adjudication."<p>For now, if I hold my tongue I shall give up the ghost - This translation, in my view, by no means expresses the sense of the original, if indeed it is not exactly the reverse. According to this version, the meaning is, that if he did not go into a vindication of himself he would die. The Hebrew, however is, "for now I will be silent, and die." That is, "I have maintained my cause, I will say no more. If there is anyone who can successfully contend with me, and can prove that my course cannot be vindicated, then I have no more to say. I will be silent, and die. I will submit to my fate without further argument, and without a complaint.

Enter the lists with him; dispute the point, and try the strength of his arguments he had to plead for his own justification: thus Christ, the head of the church, and the surety of his people, is represented as speaking when he had by his obedience and sufferings made satisfaction for them, by bringing in an everlasting righteousness, and was, as their public and federal head, justified and acquitted, <a href="/isaiah/1-4.htm">Isaiah 1:4</a>; and much the same words are put into the mouth of a believer in him, and are expressed by him, <a href="/romans/8-33.htm">Romans 8:33</a>; who stands acquitted from all charges that men or devils, friends or foes, the law or justice of God, the devil and his own unbelieving heart, at any time, can bring against him. Job, well knowing the uprightness of his heart and life, the justness of his cause depending between him and his friends, boldly challenges them to come forth, and try it with him; or rather he seems desirous that God himself would take the case in hand, and plead with him; he was ready to engage with him, and in the presence of his friends, and in their hearing; and doubted not of being acquitted before God, and at his bar; so satisfied was he of his own innocence as to the things charged upon him: <p>for now, if I hold my peace, I shall give up the ghost; his sense seems to be, that if he was not allowed to speak for himself, and plead his cause, and have a hearing of it out, he could not live, he could not contain himself, he must burst and die; nor could he live under such charges and calumnies, he must die under the weight and pressure of them; though some think that this not only expresses his eagerness and impatience to have his cause tried fairly before God, but contains in it an argument to hasten it, taken from the near approach of his death: "for now", in a little time, "I shall be silent" (w); be in the silent grave: "I shall expire"; or die; and then it will be too late; therefore if any will plead with me, let them do it immediately, or I shall be soon gone, and then it will be all over: or rather the sense is, I challenge anyone to reason the matter, and dispute the point with me; and I promise that, if the cause goes against me, "now will I be silent"; I will not say one word more in my vindication: "I will die"; or submit to any death, or any sort of punishment, that shall be pronounced upon me; I shall patiently endure it, and not complain of it, or object to the execution of it; so Sephorno. <p>(w)    "nune enim silebo et expirabo", Cocceius; so Schmidt, Schultens. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/13.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Who <i>is</i> he <i>that</i> will plead <span class="cverse3">{h}</span> with me? for now, if I hold my tongue, I shall <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> give up the ghost.</span><p>(h) To prove that God punishes me for my sins.<p>(i) If I do not defend my cause, every man will condemn me.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/job/13.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">19</span>. <span class="ital">Who is he that will plead with me</span>] i. e. plead against me, enter to oppose me with good reasons—who will bring a valid argument against me? The words are a triumphant expression of the feeling that no one will or can, cf. <a href="/isaiah/50-8.htm" title="He is near that justifies me; who will contend with me? let us stand together: who is my adversary? let him come near to me.">Isaiah 50:8</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">for now if I hold my tongue</span>, &c.] Rather, <span class="bld">for then would I hold my peace, and give up the ghost</span>; that is, in case any one should appear against him with proof of his sin. The words form a splendid climax to the declaration of his consciousness of innocence. He is sure he shall be found in the right, nay, none will be found to contend with him; if he thought any one could he would be silent and die.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who is he that will plead with me?</span> Will God himself plead?

Some translate, "For now shall I hold my peace and give up the ghost," which they explain to mean, "If God does implead me, I shall take refuge in silence, and straightway expire." But this seems an impossible conclusion, when all that Job has been aiming at and striving for since his opponents taxed him with wickedness has been that he might "speak to the Almighty, and reason with God" (ver. 3). It is far simpler to keep to the translation of the Authorized Version, and understand Job to mean that things have now reached a point at which he must either speak or expire. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/13.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Be silent therefore from me, he says to them, i.e., stand away from me and leave me in peace (opp. &#1492;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1488;&#1500;, <a href="/isaiah/41-1.htm">Isaiah 41:1</a>): then will I speak, or: in order that I may speak (the cohortative usual in apod. imper.) - he, and he alone, will defend (i.e., against God) his cause, which they have so uncharitably abandoned in spite of their better knowledge and conscience, let thereby happen (&#1506;&#1489;&#1512;, similar to <a href="/deuteronomy/24-5.htm">Deuteronomy 24:5</a>) to him &#1502;&#1492;, whatever may happen (&#1502;&#1492; &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1506;&#1489;&#1512;); or more simply: whatever it may be, quidquid est, as <a href="/2_samuel/18-22.htm">2 Samuel 18:22</a> &#1493;&#1497;&#1492;&#1497; &#1502;&#1492;, let happen whatever may happen; or more simply: whatever it may be, like &#1502;&#1492; &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; quodcunque, <a href="/numbers/23-3.htm">Numbers 23:3</a>; &#1502;&#1497; occurs also in a similar sense, thus placed last (Ewald, 104, d).</body></html>
