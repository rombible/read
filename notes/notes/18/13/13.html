He depended upon God for justification and salvation, the two great things we hope for through Christ. Temporal salvation he little expected, but of his eternal salvation he was very confident; that God would not only be his Saviour to make him happy, but his salvation, in the sight and enjoyment of whom he should be happy. He knew himself not to be a hypocrite, and concluded that he should not be rejected. We should be well pleased with God as a Friend, even when he seems against us as an enemy. We must believe that all shall work for good to us, even when all seems to make against us. We must cleave to God, yea, though we cannot for the present find comfort in him. In a dying hour, we must derive from him living comforts; and this is to trust in him, though he slay us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Hold your peace - Margin, Be silent from me; see <a href="/job/13-5.htm">Job 13:5</a>.

Or, cease "from me" (i): from speaking to me, or hindering me from speaking. Job might perceive, by some motions of his friends, that they were about to interrupt him; and therefore he desires they would be silent, and let him go on: <p>that I may speak; or, "and I will speak", <p>and let come on me what will; either from men, or from God himself; a good man, when he knows his cause is good, and he has truth on his side, is not careful or concerned what reproach may be cast upon him, or what censures from men he may undergo; or what persecutions from them he may endure; none of these things move him from his duty, or can stop his mouth from speaking the truth; let him be threatened with what he will, he cannot but speak the things which he has seen and heard, and knows to be true; as for what may come upon him from God, that he is not solicitous about; he knows he will lay nothing upon him but what is common to men, will support him under it, or deliver him from it in his own time and way, or however make all things work together for his good: some render it, "and let something pass by me", or "from me" (k); that is, somewhat of his grief and sorrow, while he was speaking and pouring out his complaints before God; but the former sense seems best. <p>(i) "desistite a me", Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator.

The passage has two parts, one preliminary, <span class="ital"><a href="/context/job/13-13.htm" title="Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak, and let come on me what will....">Job 13:13-16</a></span>, exhibiting a singular picture of the conflict between resolution and fear in Job’s mind.

The second part, <span class="ital"><a href="/context/job/13-17.htm" title="Hear diligently my speech, and my declaration with your ears....">Job 13:17-22</a></span>.

He feels, as he expresses it below (ver. 19), that, if he holds his tongue, he must die. He <span class="accented">must</span> speak, and speak he will. After that, let God do as he may please - he will accept his punishment, if God thinks fit to punish him. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/13.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>  7  Will ye speak what is wrong for God, <p>And speak what is deceitful for Him?<p>  8  Will ye be partial for Him,<p>Or will ye play the part of God's advocates?<p>  9  Would it be pleasant if He should search you out,<p>Or can ye jest with Him, as one jesteth with men?<p>10  He will surely expose you<p>If ye secretly act with partiality.<p>11  Will not His majesty confound you,<p>And His fear fall upon you?<p>Their advocacy of God - this is the thought of this strophe - is an injustice to Job, and an evil service rendered to God, which cannot escape undisguised punishment from Him. They set themselves up as God's advocates (&#1500;&#1488;&#1500; &#1512;&#1497;&#1489;, like &#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500; &#1512;&#1497;&#1489;, <a href="/judges/6-31.htm">Judges 6:31</a>), and at the same time accept His person, accipiunt (as in acceptus  equals  gratus), or lift it up, i.e., favour, or give preference to, His person, viz., at the expense of the truth: they are partial in His favour, as they are twice reminded and given to understand by the fut. energicum &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;. The addition of &#1489;&#1468;&#1505;&#1468;&#1514;&#1512; (<a href="/job/13-10.htm">Job 13:10</a>) implies that they conceal their better knowledge by the assumption of an earnest tone and bearing, expressive of the strongest conviction that they are in the right. They know that Job is not a flagrant sinner; nevertheless they deceive themselves with the idea that he is, and by reason of this delusion they take up the cause of God against him. Such perversion of the truth in majorem Dei gloriam is an abomination to God. When He searches them, His advocates, out (&#1495;&#1511;&#1512;, as Prov.Job 28:11), they will become conscious of it; or will God be mocked, as one mocketh mortal men? Comp. <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a> for a similar thought. &#1495;&#1514;&#1500; is inf. absol. after the form &#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1500;&#1468;, and &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1514;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; is also to be derived from &#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1500;&#1468;, and is fut. Hiph., the preformative not being syncopated, for &#1514;&#1468;&#1514;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; (Ges. 53, rem. 7); not Piel, from &#1492;&#1514;&#1500; (as <a href="/1_kings/18-27.htm">1 Kings 18:27</a>), with the doubling of the middle radical resolved (Olsh. in his Lehrb. S. 577). God is not pleased with &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; (<a href="/john/16-2.htm">John 16:2</a>) which gives the honour to Him, but not to truth, such &#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3bb; &#787; &#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#787; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4; &#787; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; (<a href="/romans/10-2.htm">Romans 10:2</a>), such advocacy contrary to one's better knowledge and conscience, in which the end is thought to sanctify the means. Such advocacy must be put to shame and confounded when He who needs no concealment of the truth for His justification is manifest in His &#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1514;, i.e., not: in the kindling of His wrath (after <a href="/judges/20-38.htm">Judges 20:38</a>; <a href="/isaiah/30-27.htm">Isaiah 30:27</a>), but: in His exaltation (correctly by Ralbag: &#1492;&#1514;&#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;&#1493; &#1493;&#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;&#1493;), and by His direct influence brings all untruth to light. It is the boldest thought imaginable, that one dare not have respect even to the person of God when one is obliged to lie to one's self. And still it is also self-evident. For God and truth can never be antagonistic. </body></html>
