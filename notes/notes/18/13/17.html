He depended upon God for justification and salvation, the two great things we hope for through Christ. Temporal salvation he little expected, but of his eternal salvation he was very confident; that God would not only be his Saviour to make him happy, but his salvation, in the sight and enjoyment of whom he should be happy. He knew himself not to be a hypocrite, and concluded that he should not be rejected. We should be well pleased with God as a Friend, even when he seems against us as an enemy. We must believe that all shall work for good to us, even when all seems to make against us. We must cleave to God, yea, though we cannot for the present find comfort in him. In a dying hour, we must derive from him living comforts; and this is to trust in him, though he slay us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Hear diligently my speech - That which I have made; that is, the declaration which I have made of my innocence.

They set themselves up as God's advocates (&#1500;&#1488;&#1500; &#1512;&#1497;&#1489;, like &#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500; &#1512;&#1497;&#1489;, <a href="/judges/6-31.htm">Judges 6:31</a>), and at the same time accept His person, accipiunt (as in acceptus  equals  gratus), or lift it up, i.e., favour, or give preference to, His person, viz., at the expense of the truth: they are partial in His favour, as they are twice reminded and given to understand by the fut. energicum &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;. The addition of &#1489;&#1468;&#1505;&#1468;&#1514;&#1512; (<a href="/job/13-10.htm">Job 13:10</a>) implies that they conceal their better knowledge by the assumption of an earnest tone and bearing, expressive of the strongest conviction that they are in the right. They know that Job is not a flagrant sinner; nevertheless they deceive themselves with the idea that he is, and by reason of this delusion they take up the cause of God against him. Such perversion of the truth in majorem Dei gloriam is an abomination to God. When He searches them, His advocates, out (&#1495;&#1511;&#1512;, as Prov.Job 28:11), they will become conscious of it; or will God be mocked, as one mocketh mortal men? Comp. <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a> for a similar thought. &#1495;&#1514;&#1500; is inf. absol. after the form &#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1500;&#1468;, and &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1514;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; is also to be derived from &#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1500;&#1468;, and is fut. Hiph., the preformative not being syncopated, for &#1514;&#1468;&#1514;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; (Ges. 53, rem. 7); not Piel, from &#1492;&#1514;&#1500; (as <a href="/1_kings/18-27.htm">1 Kings 18:27</a>), with the doubling of the middle radical resolved (Olsh. in his Lehrb. S. 577). God is not pleased with &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; (<a href="/john/16-2.htm">John 16:2</a>) which gives the honour to Him, but not to truth, such &#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3bb; &#787; &#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#787; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4; &#787; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; (<a href="/romans/10-2.htm">Romans 10:2</a>), such advocacy contrary to one's better knowledge and conscience, in which the end is thought to sanctify the means. Such advocacy must be put to shame and confounded when He who needs no concealment of the truth for His justification is manifest in His &#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1514;, i.e., not: in the kindling of His wrath (after <a href="/judges/20-38.htm">Judges 20:38</a>; <a href="/isaiah/30-27.htm">Isaiah 30:27</a>), but: in His exaltation (correctly by Ralbag: &#1492;&#1514;&#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;&#1493; &#1493;&#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;&#1493;), and by His direct influence brings all untruth to light. It is the boldest thought imaginable, that one dare not have respect even to the person of God when one is obliged to lie to one's self. And still it is also self-evident. For God and truth can never be antagonistic. </body></html>
