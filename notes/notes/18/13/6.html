He means, is his cause so bad as to call for your assistance to defend it? Will you plead for him, as one person pleads for another, making use of little arts and subtle contrivances in his defence? He wants no such crafty, unprincipled advocates. “Job here convicts his friends of wickedness, in taking upon them to defend God in an improper manner, as if he needed their rash censures to vindicate the ways of his providence. This was such a fault, as they had but too much reason to fear might one time or other draw down his severe chastisements on their own heads.” See Peters.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/job/13.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>13:1-12 With self-preference, Job declared that he needed not to be taught by them. Those who dispute are tempted to magnify themselves, and lower their brethren, more than is fit. When dismayed or distressed with the fear of wrath, the force of temptation, or the weight of affliction, we should apply to the Physician of our souls, who never rejects any, never prescribes amiss, and never leaves any case uncured. To Him we may speak at all times. To broken hearts and wounded consciences, all creatures, without Christ, are physicians of no value. Job evidently speaks with a very angry spirit against his friends. They had advanced some truths which nearly concerned Job, but the heart unhumbled before God, never meekly receives the reproofs of men.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Oh that ye would altogether hold your peace! - You would show your wisdom by silence.

All secret plans of the wicked, all secret sins, and the deeds of the evil-doer though veiled in deep darkness, He bringeth before the tribunal of the world. The form of writing given by the Masora is &#1506;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511;&#1493;&#1514; with koph raphatum, consequently plur. from &#1506;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511;, like &#1506;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, &#1506;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; from &#1506;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;, &#1506;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;, not from &#1506;&#1502;&#1511;.<p>(Note: Kimchi in his Wrterbuch adopts the form &#1506;&#1502;&#1511;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, but gives Abulwalid as an authority for the lengthened form, which, according to the Masora on <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/13-3.htm">Leviticus 13:3</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/13-25.htm">Leviticus 13:25</a>, is the traditional. The two exceptions where the form occurs with a long vowel are <a href="/proverbs/23-27.htm">Proverbs 23:27</a> and this passage.)<p>The lxx translates &#1502;&#1513;&#1490;&#1497;&#1488; &#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;, as it is also explained in several Midrash-passages, but only by a few Jewish expositors (Jachja, Alschech) by &#1502;&#1496;&#1506;&#1492;. The word, however, is not &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1488;, but &#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1488; with &#1513; sinistrum, after which in Midrash Esther it is explained by &#1502;&#1490;&#1491;&#1497;&#1500;; and Hirzel correctly interprets it of upward growth (Jerome after the Targ. unsuitably, multiplicat), and &#1513;&#1473;&#1496;&#1495;, on the other hand, of growth in extent. The latter word is falsely explained by the Targ. in the sense of expandere rete, and Abenezra also falsely explains: He scatters nations, and brings them to their original peace. The verb &#1513;&#1473;&#1496;&#1495; is here connected with &#1500;, as &#1492;&#1508;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; (<a href="/genesis/9-27.htm">Genesis 9:27</a>); both signify to make a wider and longer space for any one, used here of the ground where they dwell and rule. The opposite, in an unpropitious sense, is &#1492;&#1504;&#1495;&#1492;, which is used here, as <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/18-11.htm">2 Kings 18:11</a>, in a similar sense with &#1492;&#1490;&#1500;&#1492; (abducere, i.e., in servitutem). We have intentionally translated &#1490;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501; nations, &#1506;&#1501; people; for &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;, as we shall show elsewhere, is the mass held together by the ties of a common origin, language, and country; (&#1506;&#1501;) &#1506;&#1501;, the people bound together by unity of government, whose membra praecipua are consequently called &#1492;&#1506;&#1501; &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;. &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; is, in this connection, the country, although elsewhere, as <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/24-4.htm">Isaiah 24:4</a>, comp. <a href="//biblehub.com/job/42-5.htm">Job 42:5</a>, &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1506;&#1501; signifies also the people of the earth or mankind; for the Hebrew language expresses a country as a portion of the earth, and the earth as a whole, by the same name. Job dwells longer on this tragic picture, how God makes the star of the prosperity of these chiefs to set in mad and blind self-destruction, according to the proverb, quem Deus perdere vult prius dementat. This description seems to be echoed in many points in Isaiah, especially in the oracle on Egypt, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/19.htm">Job 19</a> (e.g., &#1499;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;, <a href="/job/19-14.htm">Job 19:14</a>). The connection &#1489;&#1512;&#1498; &#1500;&#1488; &#1489;&#1514;&#1492;&#1493; is not genitival; but &#1491;&#1512;&#1498; &#1500;&#1488; is either an adverbial clause appended to the verb, as &#1495;&#1511;&#1512; &#1500;&#1488;, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/34-24.htm">Job 34:24</a>, &#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; &#1500;&#1488;, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-30.htm">1 Chronicles 2:30</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-32.htm">1 Chronicles 2:32</a>, or, which we prefer as being more natural, and on account of the position of the words, a virtual adjective: in a trackless waste, as &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1500;&#1488;, <a href="/job/38-26.htm">Job 38:26</a>; &#1506;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; &#1500;&#1488;,   <a href="/2_samuel/23-4.htm">2 Samuel 23:4</a> (Olsh.).<p>Job here takes up the tone of Eliphaz (comp. <a href="/job/5-13.htm">Job 5:13</a>.). Intentionally he is made to excel the friends in a recognition of the absolute majesty of God. He is not less cognizant of it than they. </body></html>
