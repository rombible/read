Those who dispute are tempted to magnify themselves, and lower their brethren, more than is fit. When dismayed or distressed with the fear of wrath, the force of temptation, or the weight of affliction, we should apply to the Physician of our souls, who never rejects any, never prescribes amiss, and never leaves any case uncured. To Him we may speak at all times. To broken hearts and wounded consciences, all creatures, without Christ, are physicians of no value. Job evidently speaks with a very angry spirit against his friends.

The meaning in our common version is certainly not very clear. The Vulgate renders it, Memoria vestra comparabitur cineri. The Septuagint, &#x391;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; &#x399;&#787;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b1; &#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#834;&#837;  Apobe&#772;setai de humo&#772;n to gauriama isa spodo&#772; - "your boasting shall pass away like ashes." Dr. Good renders it, "Dust are your stored-up sayings." Noyes, "Your maxims are words of dust." The word rendered "remembrances" &#1494;&#1499;&#1512;&#1493;&#1503;  z&#305;&#770;kro&#770;n means properly "remembrance, memory," <a href="/joshua/4-7.htm">Joshua 4:7</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/12-14.htm">Ezekiel 12:14</a>; then a "memento," or "record;" then a "memorable saying, a maxim." This is probably the meaning here; and the reference is to the apothegms or proverbs which they had so profusely uttered, and which they regarded as so profound and worthy of attention, but which Job was disposed to regard as most common-place, and to treat with contempt.<p>Are like unto ashes - That is, they are valueless. See the notes at <a href="/isaiah/44-20.htm">Isaiah 44:20</a>. Their maxims had about the same relation to true wisdom which ashes have to substantial and nutritious food. The Hebrew here (&#1488;&#1508;&#1512; &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1497;  ma&#770;shaly 'e&#770;pher) is rather, "are parables of ashes;" - the word &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;  ma&#770;sha&#770;l meaning similitude, parable, proverb. This interpretation gives more force and beauty to the passage.<p>Your bodies -  - &#1490;&#1489;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501;  gabe&#772;ykem Vulgate, "cervices." Septuagint, &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; &#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  to de so&#772;ma pe&#772;linon - but the body is clay. The Hebrew word &#1490;&#1489;  gab, means something gibbous (from where the word "gibbous" is derived), convex, arched; hence, the "back" of animals or human beings, <a href="/ezekiel/10-12.htm">Ezekiel 10:12</a>; the boss of a shield or buckler - the "gibbous," or exterior convex part - <a href="/job/15-26.htm">Job 15:26</a>; and then, according to Gesenius, an entrenchment, a fortress, a strong-hold. According to this interpretation, the passage here means, that the arguments behind which they entrenched themselves were like clay. They could not resist an attack made upon them, but would be easily thrown down, like mud walls. Grotius renders it, "Your towers (of defense) are tumult of clay." Rosenmuller remarks on the verse that the ancients were accustomed to inscribe sentences of valuable historical facts on pillars. If these were engraved on stone, they would be permanent; if on pillars covered with clay, they would soon be obliterated. On a pillar or column at Aleandria, the architect cut his own name at the base deep in the stone. On the plaster or stucco with which the column was covered, he inscribed the name of the person to whose honor it was reared. The consequence was, that that name became soon obliterated; his own then appeared, and was permanent. But the meaning here is rather, that the apothegms and maxims behind which they entrenched themselves were like mud walls, and could not withstand an attack. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. remembrances&#8212;"proverbial maxims," so called because well remembered.<p>like unto ashes&#8212;or, "parables of ashes"; the image of lightness and nothingness (Isa 44:20).<p>bodies&#8212;rather, "entrenchments"; those of clay, as opposed to those of stone, are easy to be destroyed; so the proverbs, behind which they entrench themselves, will not shelter them when God shall appear to reprove them for their injustice to Job.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/job/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Your remembrances; </span> either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

So it turned out, cf. ch. <a href="/job/42-7.htm" title="And it was so, that after the LORD had spoken these words to Job, the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled against you, and against your two friends: for you have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job has.">Job 42:7</a> <span class="ital">seq</span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Your remembrances are like unto ashes</span>. The "remembrances" intended are probably the wise saws, embodiments of the ancient wisdom, on which Job's adversaries have relied in their disputations with him (<a href="/job/4-7.htm">Job 4:7, 8</a>; <a href="/job/8-8.htm">Job 8:8-11</a>, etc.).

These defences, Job <span class="accented">says - i.e</span>, the arguments by which his opponents support their views - are no better than "defences of clay " - easy to batter down and destroy. The ancient defences of a town were usually either of stone, as at Khorsabad ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 1. pp. 278, 279), or of crude brick faced with burnt brick, as at Babylon and elsewhere. But Job seems to be speaking of something more primitive than either of these - mere earthworks, like the Roman <span class="accented">aggera</span> hastily thrown up and easy to level with the ground. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/13.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>  3  But I would speak to the Almighty,<p>And I long to reason with God.<p>  4  And ye however are forgers of lies,<p>Physicians of no value are ye all.<p>  5  Oh that ye would altogether hold your peace,<p>It would be accounted to you as wisdom.<p>  6  Hear now my instruction,<p>Ando hearken to the answers of my lips!<p>He will no longer dispute with the friends; the more they oppose him, the more earnestly he desires to be able to argue his cause before God. &#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1501; (<a href="/job/13-3.htm">Job 13:3</a>) is disjunctive, like &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;, and introduces a new range of thoughts; lxx &#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#787; &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;, verum enim vero. True, he has said in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/9.htm">Job 9</a> that no one can maintain his cause before God; but his confidence in God grows in proportion as his distrust of the friends increases; and at the same time, the hope is begotten that God will grant him that softening of the terror of His majesty which he has reserved to himself in connection with this declaration (<a href="//biblehub.com/job/9-34.htm">Job 9:34</a>, comp. <a href="/job/13-20.htm">Job 13:20</a>.). The infin. absol. &#1492;&#1493;&#1499;&#1495;, which in <a href="/job/6-25.htm">Job 6:25</a> is used almost as a substantive, and indeed as the subject, is here in the place of the object, as e.g., <a href="/isaiah/5-5.htm">Isaiah 5:5</a>; <a href="/isaiah/58-6.htm">Isaiah 58:6</a> : to prove, i.e., my cause, to God (&#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1500;, like <a href="//biblehub.com/job/13-15.htm">Job 13:15</a>, &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493;) I long. With &#1493;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1501; (<a href="/job/13-4.htm">Job 13:4</a>) the antithesis is introduced anew: I will turn to God, you on the contrary (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768;). Since the verb &#1496;&#1508;&#1500;, from its primary meaning to spread on, smear on (whence e.g., Talmudic &#1496;&#1508;&#1500;&#1492;, the act of throwing on, as when plastering up the cracks of an oven), cogn. &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1500; (whence &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1500;, plaster, and perhaps also in the signification tasteless, <a href="/job/6-6.htm">Job 6:6</a>  equals  sticky, greasy, slimy), does not signify, at least not at first, consuere, but assuere (without any relation of root with &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1512;), we explain, not with Olshausen and others, concinnatores mendacii, such as sew together lies as patchwork; but with Hirzel and others, assutores mendacii, such as patch on lies, i.e., charge falsely, since they desire throughout to make him out to be a sinner punished according to his desert. This explanation is also confirmed by <a href="/job/14-17.htm">Job 14:17</a>. Another explanation is given by Hupfeld: sarcinatores false  equals  inanes, inutiles, so that &#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1512; signifies what lies  equals  what deceives, as in the parallel member of the verse &#1488;&#1500;&#1500;, <p>(Note: In the Talmudic, the jugular vein, the cutting of which produces death, is called &#1488;&#1500;&#1500; (later &#1506;&#1510;&#1489;, Arab. &#8219;s&#803;b), according to which (b. Chullin 121a) it is explained: healer of the jugular artery, i.e., those who try to heal what is incurable, therefore charlatans, - a strange idea, which has arisen from the defective form of writing &#1488;&#1500;&#1500;.

The parallelism is not so exactly adjusted, as e.g., even &#1512;&#1508;&#1488;&#1497; does not on account of the parallel with &#1496;&#1508;&#1500;&#1497; signify patchers, &#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, but: they are not able to heal Job's wounds with the medicine of consolation; they are medici nihili, useless physicians. <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/17-28.htm">Proverbs 17:28</a>, "Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise," applies to them, si tacuisses, sapiens mansisses; or, as a rabbinical proverb of similar meaning, quoted by Heidenheim, says, &#1492;&#1513;&#1474;&#1490;&#1492; &#1489;&#1492;&#1513;&#1474;&#1490;&#1492; &#1492;&#1500;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;, "the fatigue of comprehension is comprehension," i.e., the silent pause before a problem is half the solution. The jussive form &#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1492;&#1497;, it would be (Ges. 128, 2), is used in the conclusion of the wish. Thus he challenges them to hear his &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1499;&#1495;&#1514; (&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1499;&#1495;&#1492;) and his &#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1492;. Hirzel is quite right when he says the former does not mean defence (justification), nor the latter proofs (counter-evidence); &#1514;&#1493;&#1499;&#1495;&#1514; is, according to his signification (significatus, in distinction from sensus), &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, correptio (lxx, Vulg.), and here not so much refutation and answer, as correction in an ethical sense, in correspondence with which &#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; is also intended of reproaches, reproofs, or reprimands. </body></html>
