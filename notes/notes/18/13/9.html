Those who dispute are tempted to magnify themselves, and lower their brethren, more than is fit. When dismayed or distressed with the fear of wrath, the force of temptation, or the weight of affliction, we should apply to the Physician of our souls, who never rejects any, never prescribes amiss, and never leaves any case uncured. To Him we may speak at all times. To broken hearts and wounded consciences, all creatures, without Christ, are physicians of no value. Job evidently speaks with a very angry spirit against his friends.

The idea is, that if God should make such an investigation, the result would be highly unfavorable to them. Perhaps Job means to intimate that, if they were subjected to the kind of trial that he had been, it would be seen that they could not bear it. "Or as one man mocketh another." The idea here is, "it is possible to delude or deceive man, but God cannot be deceived. You may conceal your thoughts and motives from man, but you cannot from God. You may use arguments that may impose upon man - you may employ fallacies and sophisms which he cannot detect, but every such effort is vain with God;" compare <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9.

That is, God; searching is ascribed to him after the manner of men; not that he is ignorant of persons or things he searches after, or exercises that application, diligence, and industry, and takes those pains which are necessary in men to find out anything; when he makes search, it is not on his own account, but others; at least it is only to show his knowledge of persons and things, and to make men known to others, or things to them themselves; and is here to be understood in a judicial sense, as it frequently is the case, so it was here, a man that is "first in his own cause", as the wise man says, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/18-17.htm">Proverbs 18:17</a>, "seemeth just"; to himself and others; it looks upon the representation he makes of things as if he was in the right: "but his neighbour cometh and searcheth him"; traverses his arguments in his own vindication, and shows the fallacy of them; so Job's friends, making the worst of his cause, and the best of their own, seemed right in their own eyes; but God, who is the searcher of hearts, and who knows all things, could see through their coverings of things, and could not be deceived by them, but would find them out, and expose them; as he did afterwards, when he gave judgment against them, and declared they had not said that which was right, as his servant Job had, <a href="/job/42-7.htm">Job 42:7</a>; and therefore it was not to their profit and advantage, and to their honour and credit, to be searched out by him, or to run the risk of it, as they did, which is the amount of this question: <p>or as one mocketh another, do ye so mock him? men may be mocked by their fellow creatures, either by words or gestures, as good men usually are in all ages, especially the prophets of the Lord, and the ministers of his word; or they may he deceived and imposed upon by the false glosses and colourings of artful men, as simple men are deceived by the fair speeches of false teachers, which is no other than an illusion of them, or mocking them: in the first sense God may be mocked, though he should not; there have been and will be such bold and daring creatures as to mock at his promises and his providence, to mock at his word, ordinances, and ministers, which is interpreted by him a mocking and despising himself; but in the latter sense he cannot be mocked, and it is a vain thing to attempt it; "be not deceived, God is not mocked", <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>; he sees through all the fallacious reasonings of men; he judges not according to outward appearance; he sees and knows the heart, and all the views and designs of men, and can detect all their sophisms and false glosses; he is not to be deceived by specious pretences of doing such and such actions for his glory, as casting out good men, and their names, or traducing their characters that he may be glorified, or killing them to do him service, <a href="/isaiah/66-5.htm">Isaiah 66:5</a>; he is not to be flattered as one man may flatter another; to do this with him, is to mock him, he is not to be mocked in this way. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/13.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Is it good that he should search you out? or as one man mocketh another, do ye so mock him?</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/job/13.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">9</span>. <span class="ital">Is it good</span>] The words may mean, will it be well (for you) that He should search (or, when He shall search)? or as ch. <a href="/job/10-3.htm" title="Is it good to you that you should oppress, that you should despise the work of your hands, and shine on the counsel of the wicked?">Job 10:3</a>, do you like that He should search you out?

True, he has said in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/9.htm">Job 9</a> that no one can maintain his cause before God; but his confidence in God grows in proportion as his distrust of the friends increases; and at the same time, the hope is begotten that God will grant him that softening of the terror of His majesty which he has reserved to himself in connection with this declaration (<a href="//biblehub.com/job/9-34.htm">Job 9:34</a>, comp. <a href="/job/13-20.htm">Job 13:20</a>.). The infin. absol. &#1492;&#1493;&#1499;&#1495;, which in <a href="/job/6-25.htm">Job 6:25</a> is used almost as a substantive, and indeed as the subject, is here in the place of the object, as e.g., <a href="/isaiah/5-5.htm">Isaiah 5:5</a>; <a href="/isaiah/58-6.htm">Isaiah 58:6</a> : to prove, i.e., my cause, to God (&#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1500;, like <a href="//biblehub.com/job/13-15.htm">Job 13:15</a>, &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493;) I long. With &#1493;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1501; (<a href="/job/13-4.htm">Job 13:4</a>) the antithesis is introduced anew: I will turn to God, you on the contrary (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768;). Since the verb &#1496;&#1508;&#1500;, from its primary meaning to spread on, smear on (whence e.g., Talmudic &#1496;&#1508;&#1500;&#1492;, the act of throwing on, as when plastering up the cracks of an oven), cogn. &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1500; (whence &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1500;, plaster, and perhaps also in the signification tasteless, <a href="/job/6-6.htm">Job 6:6</a>  equals  sticky, greasy, slimy), does not signify, at least not at first, consuere, but assuere (without any relation of root with &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1512;), we explain, not with Olshausen and others, concinnatores mendacii, such as sew together lies as patchwork; but with Hirzel and others, assutores mendacii, such as patch on lies, i.e., charge falsely, since they desire throughout to make him out to be a sinner punished according to his desert. This explanation is also confirmed by <a href="/job/14-17.htm">Job 14:17</a>. Another explanation is given by Hupfeld: sarcinatores false  equals  inanes, inutiles, so that &#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1512; signifies what lies  equals  what deceives, as in the parallel member of the verse &#1488;&#1500;&#1500;, <p>(Note: In the Talmudic, the jugular vein, the cutting of which produces death, is called &#1488;&#1500;&#1500; (later &#1506;&#1510;&#1489;, Arab. &#8219;s&#803;b), according to which (b. Chullin 121a) it is explained: healer of the jugular artery, i.e., those who try to heal what is incurable, therefore charlatans, - a strange idea, which has arisen from the defective form of writing &#1488;&#1500;&#1500;. The lxx translates &#x3b9;&#787;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;.)<p>nothingness, and also &#1506;&#1502;&#1500; (<a href="/job/16-2.htm">Job 16:2</a>) in a similar connection, is not an objective but attributive genitive; but <a href="/psalms/119-69.htm">Psalm 119:69</a> is decisive against this interpretation of &#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1512; &#1496;&#1508;&#1500;&#1497;. The parallelism is not so exactly adjusted, as e.g., even &#1512;&#1508;&#1488;&#1497; does not on account of the parallel with &#1496;&#1508;&#1500;&#1497; signify patchers, &#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, but: they are not able to heal Job's wounds with the medicine of consolation; they are medici nihili, useless physicians. <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/17-28.htm">Proverbs 17:28</a>, "Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise," applies to them, si tacuisses, sapiens mansisses; or, as a rabbinical proverb of similar meaning, quoted by Heidenheim, says, &#1492;&#1513;&#1474;&#1490;&#1492; &#1489;&#1492;&#1513;&#1474;&#1490;&#1492; &#1492;&#1500;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;, "the fatigue of comprehension is comprehension," i.e., the silent pause before a problem is half the solution. The jussive form &#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1492;&#1497;, it would be (Ges. 128, 2), is used in the conclusion of the wish. Thus he challenges them to hear his &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1499;&#1495;&#1514; (&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1499;&#1495;&#1492;) and his &#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1492;. Hirzel is quite right when he says the former does not mean defence (justification), nor the latter proofs (counter-evidence); &#1514;&#1493;&#1499;&#1495;&#1514; is, according to his signification (significatus, in distinction from sensus), &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, correptio (lxx, Vulg.), and here not so much refutation and answer, as correction in an ethical sense, in correspondence with which &#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; is also intended of reproaches, reproofs, or reprimands. </body></html>
