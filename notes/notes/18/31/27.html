That he never set his heart upon the wealth of this world. How few prosperous professors can appeal to the Lord, that they have not rejoiced because their gains were great! Through the determination to be rich, numbers ruin their souls, or pierce themselves with many sorrows. 2. He never was guilty of idolatry. The source of idolatry is in the heart, and it corrupts men, and provokes God to send judgments upon a nation. 3. He neither desired nor delighted in the hurt of the worst enemy he had. If others bear malice to us, that will not justify us in bearing malice to them. 4. He had never been unkind to strangers.

The margin accords with the Hebrew. It was customary in ancient worship to kiss the idol that was worshipped; compare <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/19-18.htm">1 Kings 19:18</a>, "I have left me seven thousand in Israel - and every mouth which hath not kissed him." See, also, <a href="/hosea/13-2.htm">Hosea 13:2</a>. The Muslims at the present day, in their worship at Mecca, kiss the black stone which is fastened in the corner of the Beat Allah, as often as they pass it, in going round the Caaba. If they cannot come near enough to kiss it, they touch it with the hand, and kiss that. An Oriental pays his respects to one of a superior station by kissing his hand and putting it to his forehead. Paxton. See the custom of kissing the hand of a Prince, as it exists in Arabia, described by Niebuhr, Reisebeschreib. 1, S. 414. The custom prevailed, also, among the Romans and Greeks. Thus, Pliny (Hist. Nat. 28:2) says, Inter adorandum dexterarm ad osculum referimus, et totum corpus circumagimus. So Lucian in the book, &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;  peri orche&#772;seo&#772;s, says, "And the Indians, rising early, adore the sun - not as we, kissing the hand - &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1; &#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;  te&#772;n cheira kusantes - think that our vow is perfect." The foundation of the custom here alluded to, is the respect and affection which is shown for one by kissing; and as the heavenly bodies which were worshipped were so remote that the worshippers could not have access to them, they expressed their veneration by kissing the hand. Job means to say, that he had never performed an act of homage to the heavenly bodies. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/31.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>27. enticed&#8212;away from God to idolatry.<p>kissed &#8230; hand&#8212;"adoration," literally means this.

Drawn away by beholding the magnitude of these bodies, the swiftness of their motion, their glorious appearance, and great usefulness to mankind, to entertain a thought of their being deities; and privately to worship them, in secret acts of devotion, as by an honourable esteem of them as such, reverence and affection for them, trust and confidence in them; for, as there is a secret worshipping of the true God, so there is a secret idolatry, idolatry in the heart, and setting up of idols there, as well as worshipping them in dark places, in chambers of imagery, as the Jews did, <a href="/ezekiel/8-12.htm">Ezekiel 8:12</a>; <p>or my mouth hath kissed my hand; idols used to be kissed by their votaries, in token of their veneration of them, and as expressive of their worship of them; so Baal and Jeroboam's calves were kissed by the worshippers of them, <a href="/1_kings/19-18.htm">1 Kings 19:18</a>.

On this naturally follows the outward act which, in the case of idolatry, was commonly the act exactly expressed by the word "adore" - the movement of the hand to the mouth in token of reverence and honour (see Pliny, 'Hist.

The shaking, &#1492;&#1504;&#1497;&#1507;, of the hand, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/31-21.htm">Job 31:21</a>, is intended, like <a href="/isaiah/11-15.htm">Isaiah 11:15</a>; <a href="/isaiah/19-16.htm">Isaiah 19:16</a> (comp. the Pilel, <a href="/isaiah/10-32.htm">Isaiah 10:32</a>), <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/2-13.htm">Zechariah 2:13</a>, as a preparation for a crushing stroke. Job refrained himself from such designs upon the defenceless orphan, even when he saw his help in the gate, i.e., before the tribunal (<a href="/job/29-7.htm">Job 29:7</a>), i.e., even when he had a certain prospect or powerful assistance there. If he has acted otherwise, his &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1507;, i.e., his upper arm together with the shoulder, must fall out from its &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1501;, i.e., the back which bears it together with the shoulder-blades, and his &#1488;&#1494;&#1512;&#1506;, upper and lower arm, which is considered here according to its outward flesh, must be broken out of its &#1511;&#1504;&#1492;, tube, i.e., the reed-like hollow bone which gives support to it, i.e., be broken asunder from its basis (Syr. a radice sua), this sinning arm, which did not compassionate the naked, and mercilessly threatened the defenceless and helpless. The &#1514; raphatum which follows in both cases, and the express testimony of the Masora, show that &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1499;&#1502;&#1492; and &#1502;&#1511;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; have no Mappik.

But &#1488;&#1500;&#1497; is not favourable to this. It establishes the particular thing which he imprecates upon himself, and that consequently which, according to his own conviction and perception, ought justly to overtake him out of the general mass, viz., that terror ought to come upon him, a divine decreed weight of affliction. &#1488;&#1497;&#1491; &#1488;&#1500; is a permutative of &#1508;&#1495;&#1491;  equals  &#1508;&#1495;&#1491; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501;, and &#1488;&#1500;&#1497; with Dech equivalent to &#1488;&#1500;&#1497; (&#1497;&#1489;&#1488;) &#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492;, comp. <a href="/jeremiah/2-19.htm">Jeremiah 2:19</a> (where it is to be interpreted: and that thou lettest no fear before me come over thee).
