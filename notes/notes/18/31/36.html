We are loth to confess our faults, willing to excuse them, and to lay the blame upon others. But he that thus covers his sins, shall not prosper, Pr 28:13. He speaks of his courage in what is good, as an evidence of his sincerity in it. When men get estates unjustly, they are justly deprived of comfort from them; it was sown wheat, but shall come up thistles. What men do not come honestly by, will never do them any good. The words of Job are ended. They end with a bold assertion, that, with respect to accusation against his moral and religious character as the cause for his sufferings, he could appeal to God. But, however confident Job was, we shall see he was mistaken, chap. 40:4,5; 1Jo 1:8. Let us all judge ourselves; wherein we are guilty, let us seek forgiveness in that blood which cleanseth from all sin; and may the Lord have mercy upon us, and write his laws in our hearts!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/31.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Surely, I would take it upon my shoulder - That is, the book or bill which the Almighty would write in the case. Job says that he has such confidence that what God would record in his case would be in his favor, such confidence that he had no charge of hypocrisy against him, and that he who knew him altogether would not bring such an accusation against him, that he would bear it off triumphantly on his shoulders. It would be all that he could desire. This does not refer to what a judge would decide if the cause were submitted to him, but to a case where an opponent or adversary in court should bring all that he could say against him. He says that he would bear even such a bill on his shoulders in triumph, and that it would be a full vindication of his innocence. It would afford him the best vindication of his character, and would be that which he had long desired.<p>And bind it as a crown to me - I would regard it as an ornament - a diadem. I would bind it on my head as a crown is worn by princes, and would march forth exultingly with it. Instead of covering me with shame, it would be the source of rejoicing, and I would exhibit it every where in the most triumphant manner. It is impossible for anyone to express a more entire consciousness of innocence from charges alleged against him than Job does by this language. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/31.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>36.

He did not rejoice at the destruction (&#1508;&#1497;&#1491;, Arab. fe&#770;d, <p>(Note: Gesenius derives the noun &#1508;&#1497;&#1491; from the verb &#1508;&#1497;&#1491;, but the Arabic, which is the test here, has not only the verb fa&#770;da as med. u and as med. i in the signification to die, but also in connection with el&#775;feid (fe&#770;d) the substantival form el-f&#305;&#770;d ( equals  el-mo&#770;t), which ( equals  fiwd, comp. p. 26, note) is referable to fa&#770;da, med. u. Thus Neshwn, who in his Lexicon (vol. ii. fol. 119) even only knows fa&#770;da, med. u, in the signif. to die (comp. infra on <a href="//biblehub.com/job/39-18.htm">Job 39:18</a>, note).)<p>as <a href="/job/12-5.htm">Job 12:5</a>; <a href="/job/30-24.htm">Job 30:24</a>) of his enemy who was full of hatred towards him (&#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1504;&#1488;&#1497;, elsewhere also &#1513;&#1474;&#1504;&#1488;&#1497;), and was not excited with delight (&#1492;&#1514;&#1506;&#1512;&#1512;, to excite one's self, a description of emotion, whether it be pleasure, or as <a href="//biblehub.com/job/17-8.htm">Job 17:8</a>, displeasure, as a not merely passive but moral incident) if calamity came upon him, and he did not allow his palate (&#1495;&#1498; as the instrument of speech, like <a href="/job/6-30.htm">Job 6:30</a>) to sin by asking God that he might die as a curse. Love towards an enemy is enjoined by the Thora, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/23-4.htm">Exodus 23:4</a>, but it is more or less with a national limitation, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>, because the Thora is the law of a people shut out from the rest of the world, and in a state of war against it (according to which <a href="/matthew/5-43.htm">Matthew 5:43</a> is to be understood); the books of the Chokma, however (comp. <a href="/proverbs/24-17.htm">Proverbs 24:17</a>; <a href="/proverbs/25-21.htm">Proverbs 25:21</a>), remove every limit from the love of enemies, and recognise no difference, but enjoin love towards man as man. With <a href="/job/31-30.htm">Job 31:30</a> this strophe closes. Among modern expositors, only Arnh. takes in <a href="/job/31-31.htm">Job 31:31</a> as belonging to it: "Would not the people of my tent then have said: Would that we had of his flesh?! we have not had enough of it," i.e., we would eat him up both skin and hair. Of course it does not mean after the manner of cannibals, but figuratively, as <a href="/job/19-22.htm">Job 19:22</a>; but in a figurative sense "to eat any one's flesh" in Semitic is equivalent to lacerare, vellicare, obtrectare (vid., on <a href="//biblehub.com/job/19-22.htm">Job 19:22</a>, and comp. also Sur. xlix. 12 of the Koran, and Schultens' Erpenius, pp. 592f.), which is not suitable here, as in general this drawing of <a href="/job/31-31.htm">Job 31:31</a> to <a href="/job/31-29.htm">Job 31:29</a> is in every respect, and especially that of the syntax, inadmissible.
