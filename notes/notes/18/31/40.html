We are loth to confess our faults, willing to excuse them, and to lay the blame upon others. But he that thus covers his sins, shall not prosper, Pr 28:13. He speaks of his courage in what is good, as an evidence of his sincerity in it. When men get estates unjustly, they are justly deprived of comfort from them; it was sown wheat, but shall come up thistles. What men do not come honestly by, will never do them any good. The words of Job are ended. They end with a bold assertion, that, with respect to accusation against his moral and religious character as the cause for his sufferings, he could appeal to God. But, however confident Job was, we shall see he was mistaken, chap. 40:4,5; 1Jo 1:8. Let us all judge ourselves; wherein we are guilty, let us seek forgiveness in that blood which cleanseth from all sin; and may the Lord have mercy upon us, and write his laws in our hearts!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/31.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Let thistles grow; - <a href="/genesis/3-18.htm">Genesis 3:18</a>. Thistles are valueless; and Job is so confident of entire innocence in regard to this, that he says he would be willing, if he were guilty, to have his whole land overrun with noxious weeds.<p>And cockle - Cockle is a well known herb that gets into wheat or other grain. It has a bluish flower, and small black seed, and is injurious because it tends to discolor the flour. It is not certain by any means, however, that this is intended here. The margin is, noisome weeds. The Hebrew word &#1489;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;  bo'sha&#770;h is from &#1489;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;  ba&#770;'ash, "to have a bad smell, to stink," and was given to the weed here referred to on that account, compare <a href="/isaiah/34-3.htm">Isaiah 34:3</a>. The cockle however, has no unpleasant odor, and the word here probably means noxious weeds. So it is rendered by Herder and by Noyes. The Septuagint has &#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  batos, bramble; the Vulgate, spina, thorn; Prof. Lee, prunus sylvestris, "a bramble resembling the hawthorn;" Schultens, labrusca, wild vine.<p>The words of Job are ended - That is, in the present speech or argument; his discussions with his friends are closed. He spoke afterward, as recorded in the subsequent chapters, but not in controversy with them. He had vindicated his character, sustained his positions, and they had nothing to reply. The remainder of the book is occupied mainly with the speech of Elihu, and with the solemn and sublime address which God himself makes. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/31.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>40. thistles&#8212;or brambles, thorns.<p>cockle&#8212;literally, "noxious weeds."<p>The words &#8230; ended&#8212;that is, in the controversy with the friends. He spoke in the book afterwards, but not to them. At Job 31:37 would be the regular conclusion in strict art. But Job 31:38-40 are naturally added by one whose mind in agitation recurs to its sense of innocence, even after it has come to the usual stopping point; this takes away the appearance of rhetorical artifice. Hence the transposition by Eichorn of Job 31:38-40 to follow Job 31:25 is quite unwarranted.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/job/31.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> To wit, in answer to his friends; for he speaks but little afterwards, and that is to God. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/job/31.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Let thistles grow instead of wheat, and cockle instead of barley,.... This is an imprecation of Job's, in which he wishes that if what he had said was not true, or if he was guilty of the crimes he denied, that when and where he sowed wheat, thorns or thistles might come up instead of it, or tares, as some Jewish writers (d) interpret it; and that when and where he should sow barley, cockle, or darnel, or any "stinking" or "harmful" weed (e), as the word signifies, might spring up in room of it; respect seems to be had to the original curse upon the earth, and by the judgment of God is sometimes the case, that a fruitful land is turned into barrenness for the wickedness of them that dwell in it, <a href="/genesis/3-18.htm">Genesis 3:18</a>; <p>the words of Job are ended; which is either said by himself, at the close of his speech; thus far says Job, and no farther, having said enough in his own defence, and for the confutation of his antagonists, and so closes in a way of triumph: or else this was added by Moses, supposed to have written this book; or by some other hand, as Ezra, upon the revision of it, and other books of the Old Testament, when put in order by him: and these were the last words of Job to his friends, and in vindication of himself; for though there is somewhat more said afterwards by him, and but little, yet to God, and by way of humiliation, acknowledging his sin, and repentance for it with shame and abhorrence; see <a href="/job/40-3.htm">Job 40:3</a>. Jarchi, and so the Midrash, understand this concluding clause as all imprecation of Job's; that if he had done otherwise than he had declared, he wishes that these might be his last words, and he become dumb, and never open his mouth more; but, as Bar Tzemach observes, the simple sense is, that his words were now completed and finished, just as the prayers of David, the son of Jesse, are said to be, <a href="/psalms/72-20.htm">Psalm 72:20</a>. <p>(d) Bar Tzemach, et alii.

For “thistles” perhaps <span class="ital">thorns</span> is more accurate. The word translated “cockle” means perhaps any noisome weed. The concrete expressions, however, add to the vigour of the passage.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Some have thought that these last verses (38–40) have been misplaced, and ought to be introduced at some other point in the chapter, allowing Job’s challenge <span class="ital"><a href="/context/job/31-35.htm" title="Oh that one would hear me! behold, my desire is, that the Almighty would answer me, and that my adversary had written a book....">Job 31:35-37</a></span> to be the last words which he utters. To modern feeling the passage would thus gain in rhetorical effect; but it is not certain that the Author’s taste would have coincided with modern feeling in this instance. And it is difficult to find in the chapter a suitable place where the verses could be inserted. If the verses belong to the passage at all, which there is no reason to doubt, they seem to stand in the only place suitable for them.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The concluding statement “the words of Job are ended” hardly belongs to the Author of the Book. It is the remark of some editor or copyist, who drew attention to the fact that Job’s connected discourses here come to an end. It is rather hazardous to draw any critical conclusion from it in reference to the immediately following speeches of Elihu.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 40.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let thistles grow instead of wheat, and cockles instead of barley</span>. Then let me be appropriately punished by finding the land, whereof I have wrongfully become possessed, produce nothing but thistles (or thorns) and noxious weeds, such as cockles (Authorized Version) or hemlock (Professor Lee). <span class="cmt_word">The words of Job are ended</span>. This may be regarded either as Job's own conclusion of his long speech, or as a remark of the author's. On the whole, the former view is to be preferred. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/31.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>With &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; follows the motive which Job might have had for hiding himself with his sin: he has been neither an open sinner, nor from fear of men and a feeling of honour a secret sinner. He cherished within him no secret accursed thing, and had no need for playing the hypocrite, because he dreaded (&#1506;&#1512;&#1509; only here with the acc. of the obj. feared) the great multitude of the people (&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492; not adv. but adj.; &#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503; with Mercha-Zinnorith, consequently fem., as &#1506;&#1501; sometimes, Ew. 174, b), and consequently the moral judgment of the people; and because he feared the stigma of the families, and therefore the loss of honour in the higher circles of society, so that as a consequence he should have kept himself quiet and retired, without going out of the door. One might think of that abhorrence of voluptuousness, with which, in the consciousness of its condemnatory nature, a man shuts himself up in deep darkness; but according to <a href="/job/31-33.htm">Job 31:33</a> it is in general deeds that are intended, which Job would have ground for studiously concealing, because if they had become known he would have appeared a person to be scouted and despised: he could frankly and freely meet any person's gaze, and had no occasion to fear the judgment of men, because he feared sin. He did nothing which he should have caused for carefully keeping from the light of publicity. And yet his affliction is to be accounted as the punishment of hidden sin! as proof that he has committed punishable sin, which, however, he will not confess! </body></html>
