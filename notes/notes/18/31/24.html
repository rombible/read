Job here introduces another class of sins, and says that his conscience did not charge him with guilt in respect to them. He had before spoken mainly of social duties, and of his manner of life toward the poor, the needy, the widow, and the orphan. He here turns to the duty which he owed to God, and says that his conscience did not charge him with idolatry in any form. He had indeed been rich, but he had not fixed his affections with idolatrous attachment on his wealth.<p>Or have said to fine gold - The word used here (&#1499;&#1514;&#1501;  kethem) is the same which is employed in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/28-16.htm">Job 28:16</a>, to denote the gold of Ophir. It is used to express that which was most pure - from the verb &#1499;&#1514;&#1501;  ka&#770;tham - to hide, to hoard, and then denoting that which was hidden, hoarded, precious. The meaning is, that he had not put his trust in that which was most sought after, and which was deemed of the highest value by people. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/31.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24, 25.

Job here purges himself from idolatry in a figurative sense, as he afterwards does from it, taken in a literal sense; for covetousness is idolatry, and a covetous man is an idolater; he worships his gold and silver, placing his affections on them, and putting his trust and confidence in them, <a href="/ephesians/5-5.htm">Ephesians 5:5</a>; for to make gold the object or ground of hope is to place it in the room of God, who is the Hope of Israel, and in whom every good man should trust, and whom he should make his hope, <a href="/jeremiah/14-8.htm">Jeremiah 14:8</a>; not gold on earth, but glory in heaven, is what the good man is hoping for; and not riches, but Christ and his righteousness, are the foundation of such an hope; to make gold our hope, is to have hope in this life, and to make a thing present the object of it; whereas true hope is of things not seen and future, and if only in this life good men have hope, they are of all most miserable; but they have in heavens better and a more enduring substance, and a better ground for hope of that substance, than worldly wealth and riches can give: <p>or have said to the fine gold, thou art my confidence; as bad men do, and good men are prone unto, and therefore to be cautioned against it, <a href="/psalms/49-6.htm">Psalm 49:6</a>; for this is not only to trust in uncertain riches, and in unsatisfying ones, but to put them in the stead of God, who is or ought to be the confidence of the ends of the earth: not gold, but the living God, who gives all things richly to enjoy, is to be trusted in; when men covet riches, and trust in them as their security from evil, and that they may live independent of the providence of God, it is virtually to deny it, and carries in it secret atheism; as well as such a confidence is destruction of the worship of God, and such a temper makes a man an unprofitable hearer, plunges him into errors and hurtful lusts, and endangers his everlasting happiness, <a href="/habakkuk/2-9.htm">Habakkuk 2:9</a>; in later times the Romans worshipped the goddess "Pecunia", or money, as Austin (z) relates. <p>(z) De Civitate Dei, l. 4. c. 21. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/31.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">If I have made gold my hope, or have said to the fine gold, Thou art my confidence;</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/job/31.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">24–34</span>.

On &#1495;&#1508;&#1509;, vid., on <a href="/job/21-21.htm">Job 21:21</a>; it signifies solicitude (what is ardently desired) and business, here the former: what is ever the interest and want of the poor (the reduced or those without means). From such like things he does not keep the poor back, i.e., does not refuse them; and the eyes of the widow he did not cause or allow to languish (&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;, to bring to an end, i.e., cause to languish, of the eyes, as <a href="/leviticus/26-16.htm">Leviticus 26:16</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/2-33.htm">1 Samuel 2:33</a>); he let not their longing for assistance be consumed of itself, let not the fountain of their tears become dry without effect. If he had done the opposite, if he had eaten his bread (&#1508;&#1468;&#1514;  equals  &#1508;&#1468;&#1514; &#1500;&#1495;&#1501;) alone, and not allowed the orphan to eat of it with him - but no, he had not acted thus; on the contrary (&#1499;&#1468;&#1497; as <a href="/psalms/130-4.htm">Psalm 130:4</a> and frequently), he (the parentless one) grew up to him (&#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1500;&#1504;&#1497;  equals  &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1500; &#1500;&#1468;&#1497;, Ges. 121, 4, according to Ew. 315, b, "by the interweaving of the dialects of the people into the ancient form of the declining language;" perhaps it is more correct to say it is by virtue of a poetic, forced, and rare brevity of expression) as to a father ( equals  &#1500;&#1488;&#1489; &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;), and from his mother's womb he guided her, the helpless and defenceless widow, like a faithful child leading its sick or aged mother. The hyperbolical expression &#1502;&#1489;&#1468;&#1496;&#1503; &#1488;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497; dates this sympathizing and active charity back to the very beginning of Job's life. He means to say that it is in-born to him, and he has exercised it ever since he was first able to do so. The brevity of the form &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1500;&#1504;&#1497;, brief to incorrectness, might be removed by the pointing &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1504;&#1497; (Olsh.): from my youth up he (the fatherless one) honoured me as a father; and &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1504;&#1497; (instead of &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497; would be explained by the consideration, that a veneration is meant that attributed a dignity which exceed his age to the &#1504;&#1506;&#1512; who was not yet old enough to be a father. But &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1500; signifies "to cause to grow" in such a connection elsewhere (parall. &#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1501;, to raise), wherefore lxx translates &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; (&#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;); and &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1500;&#1504;&#1497; has similar examples of the construction of intransitives with the acc. instead of the dat. (especially <a href="/zechariah/7-5.htm">Zechariah 7:5</a>) in its favour: they became me great, i.e., became great in respect of me. Other ways of getting over the difficulty are hardly worth mentioning: the Syriac version reads &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1489; (pain) and &#1488;&#1504;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514;; Raschi makes <a href="//biblehub.com/job/31-18.htm">Job 31:18</a>, the idea of benevolence, the subj., and <a href="/job/31-18.htm">Job 31:18</a> (as &#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1492;, attribute) the obj.
