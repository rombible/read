He understood the spiritual nature of God's commandments, as reaching to the thoughts and intents of the heart. It is best to let our actions speak for us; but in some cases we owe it to ourselves and to the cause of God, solemnly to protest our innocence of the crimes of which we are falsely accused. The lusts of the flesh, and the love of the world, are two fatal rocks on which multitudes split; against these Job protests he was always careful to stand upon his guard. And God takes more exact notice of us than we do of ourselves; let us therefore walk circumspectly. He carefully avoided all sinful means of getting wealth. He dreaded all forbidden profit as much as all forbidden pleasure. What we have in the world may be used with comfort, or lost with comfort, if honestly gotten. Without strict honestly and faithfulness in all our dealings, we can have no good evidence of true godliness. Yet how many professors are unable to abide this touchstone!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/31.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Let me be weighed in an even balance - Margin, him weigh me in balances of justice. That is, let him ascertain exactly my character, and treat me accordingly. If on trial it be found that I am guilty in this respect, I consent to be punished accordingly. Scales or balances are often used as emblematic of justice. Many suppose, however, that this verse is a parenthesis, and that the imprecation in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/31-8.htm">Job 31:8</a>, relates to <a href="//biblehub.com/job/31-5.htm">Job 31:5</a>, as well as to <a href="/job/31-7.htm">Job 31:7</a>. But most probably the meaning is, that he consented to have his life tried in this respect in the most exact and rigid manner, and was willing to abide the result. A man may express such a consciousness of integrity in his dealings with others, without any improper self-reliance or boasting. It may be a simple fact of which he may be certain, that he has never meant to defraud any man. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/31.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6.

An imprecation; or rather, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. A submission to trial, as the following words show. The sense is, I am so far from being conscious to myself of any hypocrisy or secret wickedness, whereby I have brought these unusual judgments upon myself, as you traduce me, that I desire nothing more than to have my heart and life weighed in just balances, and searched out by the all-seeing God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">That God may know, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">and let him know</span> (i.e. let him acknowledge and show that he knoweth and approveth); or let him make known to my friends and others, who censure or condemn me.

Or "in balances of righteousness" (z), even in the balance or strict justice, the justice of God; he was so conscious to himself that he had done no injustice to any man in his dealings with them, that, if weight of righteousness, which was to be, and was the rule of his conduct between man and man, was put into one scale, and his actions into another, the balance would be even, there would be nothing wanting, or, however, that would require any severe censure: <p>that God may know mine integrity; God did knew his integrity, and bore a testimony to it, and to his retaining it, <a href="/job/2-3.htm">Job 2:3</a>; but his meaning is, that should God strictly inquire into his life and conduct with respect to his dealings with men, as it would appear that he had lived in all good conscience to that day, so he doubted not but he would find his integrity such, that he would own and acknowledge it, approve of it, and commend it, and make it known to his friends and others, whereby he would be cleared of all those calumnies that were cast upon him. Some connect these words with the following, reading them affirmatively, "God knows mine integrity"; he knows that my step has not turned out of the way of truth and righteousness; that my heart has not walked after mine eye, in lustful thoughts and desires; and that there is no spoil, nor rapine, nor violence in my hand, that I should deserve such a punishment as to sow, and another eat: thus Sephorno. <p>(z)  "in bilancibus justitiae", Montanus, Mercerus, Drusius, so Junius &amp; Tremellius, Cocceius, Michaelis, Schultens. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/31.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Let me be weighed in an even balance, that God may know mine <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> integrity.</span><p>(d) He shows what his uprightness stands in, in as much as he was blameless before men and did not sin against the second table.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/job/31.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>.

It is an essential part of every Egyptian representation of the final judgment of souls by Osiris. Each man's merits are formally weighed in a balance, which is carefully depicted, and he is judged accordingly. Job asks that this may be done in his case, either immediately or at any rate ultimately. He would have the act performed, <span class="cmt_word">that God may know his integrity</span>; or rather, may <span class="accented">recognize</span> it. (So Professor Leo.) Job has no doubt that a thorough investigation of his case will lead to a, acknowledgment and proclamation of his innocence. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/30.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Now for the first time he speaks of his disfigurement by leprosy in particular: my skin (&#1506;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;, masc., as it is also used in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/19-26.htm">Job 19:26</a>, only apparently as fem.) is become black (nigruit) from me, i.e., being become black, has peeled from me, and my bones (&#1506;&#1510;&#1502;&#1497;, construed as fem. like <a href="/job/19-20.htm">Job 19:20</a>; <a href="/psalms/102-6.htm">Psalm 102:6</a>) are consumed, or put in a glow (&#1495;&#1512;&#1492;, Milel, from &#1495;&#1512;&#1512;, as <a href="/ezekiel/24-11.htm">Ezekiel 24:11</a>) by a parching heat.

Thus the second part of the monologue closes. It is somewhat lengthened and tedious; it is Job's last sorrowful lament before the catastrophe. What a delicate touch of the poet is it that he makes this lament, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/30-31.htm">Job 30:31</a>, die away so melodiously! One hears the prolonged vibration of its elegiac strains. The festive and joyous music is hushed; the only tones are tones of sadness and lament, mesto, flebile. </body></html>
