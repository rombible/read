He is most large upon this head, because in this matter he was particularly accused. He was tender of all, and hurtful to none. Notice the principles by which Job was restrained from being uncharitable and unmerciful. He stood in awe of the Lord, as certainly against him, if he should wrong the poor. Regard to worldly interests may restrain a man from actual crimes; but the grace of God alone can make him hate, dread, and shun sinful thoughts and desires.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/31.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>If I have seen any perish ... - He turns to another virtue of the same general class - that of providing for the poor.

A man may be in such poor circumstances as to want proper clothing to cover his naked body with, and preserve it from the inclemencies of the weather, and for want of it be ready to perish or die with cold. Job denies he had seen any such; not that he had never seen persons in such perishing circumstances; but he had not seen them as to "despise" them, as the Vulgate Latin version, as to have them in contempt, or look at them with disdain because of their poverty and rags, or sordid apparel; or so as to "overlook" them, as the Septuagint version, to neglect them, and to take no notice of them, and make no provision for their clothing, a warm and comfortable garment, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/31-20.htm">Job 31:20</a>, <p>or any poor without covering; without clothing sufficient to cover himself with, and keep him warm; Job had seen such objects, but he did not leave them in such a condition; he saw them, and had compassion on them, and clothed them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/31.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">If I have seen any perish for want of clothing, or any poor without covering;</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/job/31.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">19</span>. <span class="ital">seen any perish</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">perishing</span>, or ready to perish, ch. <a href="/job/29-13.htm" title="The blessing of him that was ready to perish came on me: and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy.">Job 29:13</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If I have seen any perish for want of clothing</span> (scrap. <a href="/job/22-6.htm">Job 22:6</a>, where Eliphaz taxes Job with so acting; and, on the duty of clothing the naked, see <a href="/isaiah/58-7.htm">Isaiah 58:7</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/18-7.htm">Ezekiel 18:7, 16</a>; <a href="/matthew/25-36.htm">Matthew 25:36</a><span class="cmt_word">).

Christopher Scultetus observes here: Gentiles quidem non concedebant jus servo contra dominum, cui etiam vitae necisque potestas in ipsum erat; sed Iob amore justitiae libere se demisit, ut vel per alios judices aut arbitros litem talem curaret decidi vel sibi ipsi sit moderatus, ut juste pronuntiaret.
