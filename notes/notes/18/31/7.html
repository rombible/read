He understood the spiritual nature of God's commandments, as reaching to the thoughts and intents of the heart. It is best to let our actions speak for us; but in some cases we owe it to ourselves and to the cause of God, solemnly to protest our innocence of the crimes of which we are falsely accused. The lusts of the flesh, and the love of the world, are two fatal rocks on which multitudes split; against these Job protests he was always careful to stand upon his guard. And God takes more exact notice of us than we do of ourselves; let us therefore walk circumspectly. He carefully avoided all sinful means of getting wealth. He dreaded all forbidden profit as much as all forbidden pleasure. What we have in the world may be used with comfort, or lost with comfort, if honestly gotten. Without strict honestly and faithfulness in all our dealings, we can have no good evidence of true godliness.

The way of God, the way of his commandments, the good and right way, the way of truth and righteousness, so far as Job had knowledge of it: for, besides the law and light of nature the Gentiles had in common, good men had some revelation, and notions of the mind and will of God unto them, both before and after the flood, previous to the Mosaic dispensation; which in some measure directed them what way to walk in, with respect to worship and duty; and from this way Job swerved not; not that he walked so perfectly in it as to be free from sin, and never commit any; or that he never took a step out of the way, or stepped awry; but he did not knowingly, wittingly, and purposely turn out of the way; and when, through infirmity of the flesh, the temptations of Satan, and snares of the world, he was drawn aside, he did not obstinately and finally persist therein; though this may have respect not to sin in general, but to the particular sin he is clearing himself from, namely, dealing falsely and deceitfully with men, in whatsoever he had to do with them, in matters of "meum" and "tuum"; or with regard to the rules of justice and equity between man and man, he was not conscious to himself he had departed from them; a like expression to those in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/7-3.htm">Psalm 7:3</a>, where some particular sin is referred unto: <p>and mine heart walked after mine eyes; meaning not in the lust of uncleanness, of which he had spoken before, as such do whose eyes are full of adultery; but in the sin of covetousness, so Achan's heart walked after his eyes, <a href="/joshua/7-20.htm">Joshua 7:20</a>; and this is one of the three things the world is full of, and the men of it indulge themselves in, the lust of the eyes, <a href="/1_john/2-16.htm">1 John 2:16</a>; the sense is, that when he saw the riches and wealth of others, he did not covet them, nor take any illicit methods to get them out of their hands; or, when he saw the goods they were possessed of, and had with them to dispose of, he did not take the advantage of their ignorance, or use any evil ways and means to cheat and beguile them of them: it is pleasing to the flesh for the heart to walk after the eye, or to indulge to that which it is taken with; but it is very vain and foolish, as well as very dangerous so to do, <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:10</a>; a good man chooses a better guide than his eyes; even to be a follower of God, to tread in the steps of his living Redeemer, to walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit, and according to the law and will of God: <p>and if any blot cleaved to my hands; any spot, stain, or blemish, as all sin is of a defiling nature, particularly the hands may be blotted by shedding innocent blood, by taking bribes to pervert judgment; which the Septuagint version directs to here; and by getting, holding, and retaining mammon of unrighteousness, or ill gotten goods; which is what is chiefly if not solely intended here; for it may be rendered, "if any thing hath cleaved", &amp;c. so Aben Ezra and Ben Gersom; for the word signifies both a "blot" and "anything": and the Targum takes in both senses: the meaning seems to be, that there was not anything of another man's in his hands, which he had taken from him by force and violence, or find obtained by any deceitful methods, and which he held fast, and it stuck with him as pitch to the hands, and he did not care to part with it, or restore it, whereby his hands were defiled; otherwise Job had no such opinion of the cleanness of his hands and actions, as if he thought there was no spot of sin in them, or only such as he could wash out himself; he clearly speaks the contrary, <a href="/job/9-30.htm">Job 9:30</a>; which is the sense of every good man, who, conscious of his spots and blemishes, washes his hands, his actions, his conversation garments, and makes them white in the blood of the Lamb; and such, and such only, have clean hands. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/31.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">If my step hath turned out of the way, and mine heart <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> walked after mine eyes, and if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands;</span><p>(e) That is, has accomplished the lust of my eyes.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/job/31.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">7</span>. <span class="ital">out of the way</span>] i. e. the way of rectitude, set before him by God, ch. <a href="/job/23-11.htm" title="My foot has held his steps, his way have I kept, and not declined.">Job 23:11</a>.

Job is not an Israelite, he is without the pale of the positive, Sinaitic revelation; his religion is the old patriarchal religion, which even in the present day is called d&#305;&#770;n Ibra&#770;h&#305;&#770;m (the religion of Abraham), or d&#305;&#770;n el-bedu (the religion of the steppe) as the religion of those Arabs who are not Moslem, or at least influenced by the penetrating Islamism, and is called by Meja&#770;n&#305;&#770;sh&#305;&#770; el-han&#305;&#770;f&#305;&#770;je (vid., supra, p. 362, note) as the patriarchally orthodox religion.<p>(Note: Also in the Merg district east of Damascus, which is peopled by an ancient unmixed race, because the fever which prevails there kills strangers, remnants of the d&#305;&#770;n Ibra&#770;h&#305;&#770;m have been preserved despite the penetrating Islamism. There the mulaqqin (Souffleur), who says the creed into the grave as a farewell to the buried one, adds the following words: "The muslim is my brother, the muslima my sister, Abraham is my father (ab&#305;&#770;), his religion (d&#305;&#770;nuh) is mine, and his confession (medhebuh) mine." It is indisputable that the words muslim (one who is submissive to God) and islm (submission to God) have originally belonged to the d&#305;&#770;n Ibra&#770;h&#305;&#770;m. It is also remarkable that the Moslem salutation sela&#770;m occurs only as a sign in war among the wandering tribes, and that the guest parts from his host with the words: da&#770;ima&#770; besa&#770;t el-Chal&#305;&#770;l&#770; la&#770; maqtu&#770;&#8219; wala&#770; memnu&#770;&#8219;, i.e., mayest thou always have Abraham's table, and plenty of provisions and guests. - Wetzst.)<p>As little as this religion, even in the present day, is acquainted with the specific Mohammedan commandments, so little knew Job of the specifically Israelitish. On the contrary, his confession, which he lays down in this third monologue, coincides remarkably with the ten commandments of piety (el-fela&#770;h) peculiar to the d&#305;&#770;n Ibra&#770;h&#305;&#770;m, although it differs in this respect, that it does not give the prominence to submission to the dispensations of God, that tesl&#305;&#770;m which, as the whole of this didactic poem teaches by its issue, is the duty of the perfectly pious; also bravery in defence of holy property and rights is wanting, which among the wandering tribes is accounted as an essential part of the hebbet er-r&#305;&#770;h (inspiration of the Divine Being), i.e., active piety, and to which it is similarly related, as to the binding notion of "honour" which was coined by the western chivalry of the middle ages.<p>Job begins with the duty of chastity. Consistently with the prologue, which the drama itself nowhere belies, he is living in monogamy, as at the present day the orthodox Arabs, averse to Islamism, are not addicted to Moslem polygamy. With the confession of having maintained this marriage (although, to infer from the prologue, it was not an over-happy, deeply sympathetic one) sacred, and restrained himself not only from every adulterous act, but also from adulterous desires, his confessions begin. Here, in the middle of the Old Testament, without the pale of the Old Testament &#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, we meet just that moral strictness and depth with which the Preacher on the mount, <a href="/matthew/5-27.htm">Matthew 5:27</a>., opposes the spirit to the letter of the seventh commandment. It is &#1500;&#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;, not &#1506;&#1501;&#1470;&#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;, designedly; &#1499;&#1512;&#1514; &#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; &#1506;&#1501; or &#1488;&#1514; is the usual phrase where two equals are concerned; on the contrary, &#1499;&#1512;&#1514; &#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; &#1500; where two the superior - Jehovah, or a king, or conqueror - binds himself to another under prescribed conditions, or the covenant is made not so much by a mutual advance as by the one taking the initiative. In this latter case, the secondary notions of a promise given (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/55-3.htm">Isaiah 55:3</a>), or even, as here, of a law prescribed, are combined with &#1499;&#1512;&#1514; &#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514;: "as lord of my senses I prescribed this law for my eyes" (Ew.). The eyes, says a Talmudic proverb, are the procuresses of sin (&#1505;&#1512;&#1505;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497; &#1491;&#1495;&#1496;&#1488;&#1492; &#1504;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492;&#1493;); "to close his eyes, that they may not feast on evil," is, in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/33-15.htm">Isaiah 33:15</a>, a clearly defined line in the picture of him on whom the everlasting burnings can have no hold.

Adulterium reale, and in fact two-sided, is first spoken of in the third strophe, here it is adulterium mentale and one-sided; the object named is not any maiden whatever, but any &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;, because virginity is ever to be revered, a most sacred thing, the holy purity of which Job acknowledges himself to have guarded against profanation from any lascivious gaze by keeping a strict watch over his eyes. The Waw of &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492; is, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/31-14.htm">Job 31:14</a>, copulative: and if I had done it, what punishment might I have looked for?<p>The question, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/31-2.htm">Job 31:2</a>, is proposed in order that it may be answered in <a href="/job/31-3.htm">Job 31:3</a> again in the form of a question: in consideration of the just punishment which the injurer of female innocence meets, Job disavows every unchaste look.

Conscious of the just punishment of the unchaste, and, as he adds in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/31-4.htm">Job 31:4</a>, of the omniscience of the heavenly Judge, Job has made dominion over sin, even in its first beginnings and motions, his principle.<p>The &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;, which gives prominence to the subject, means Him who punishes the unchaste. By Him who observes his walk on every side, and counts (&#1497;&#1505;&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;, plene, according to Ew. 138, a, on account of the pause, but vid., the similar form of writing, <a href="/job/39-2.htm">Job 39:2</a>; <a href="/job/18-15.htm">Job 18:15</a>) all his steps, Job has been kept back from sin, and to Him Job can appeal as a witness. </body></html>
