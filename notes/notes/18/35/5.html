They are far above us, and God is far above them; how much then is he out of the reach, either of our sins or of our services! We have no reason to complain if we have not what we expect, but should be thankful that we have better than we deserve.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/35.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Look unto the heavens, and see - This is the commencement of the reply which Elihu makes to the sentiment which he had understood Job to advance, and which Eliphaz had proposed formerly to examine. The general object of the reply is, to show that God is so great that he cannot be affected with human conduct, and that he has no interest in treating people otherwise than according to character. He is so exalted that their conduct cannot reach and affect his happiness. It ought to be "presumed," therefore, since there is no motive to the contrary, that the dealings of God with people would be impartial, and that there "would" be an advantage in serving him - not because people could lay him under "obligation," but because it was right and proper that such advantage should accrue to them. To impress this view on the mind, Elihu directs Job and his friends to look to the heavens - so lofty, grand, and sublime; to reflect how much higher they are than man; and to remember that the great Creator is "above" all those heavens, and "thus" to see that he is so far cxalted that he is not dependent on man; that he cannot be affected by the righteousness or wickedness of his creatures; that his happiness is not dependent on them, and consequently that it is to bc presumed that he would act impartially, and treat all people as they deserved. There "would" be, therefore, an advantage in serving God.<p>And behold the clouds - Also far above us, and seeming to float in the heavens. The sentiment here is, that one view of the astonishing display of wisdom and power above us must extinguish every feeling that he will be influenced in his dealings as people are in theirs, or that he can gain or suffer anything by the good or bad behavior of his creatures. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/35.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5-8. Elihu like Eliphaz (Job 22:2, 3, 12) shows that God is too exalted in nature to be susceptible of benefit or hurt from the righteousness or sin of men respectively; it is themselves that they benefit by righteousness, or hurt by sin.<p>behold the clouds, which are higher than thou&#8212;spoken with irony. Not only are they higher than thou, but thou canst not even reach them clearly with the eye. Yet these are not as high as God's seat. God is therefore too exalted to be dependent on man. Therefore He has no inducement to injustice in His dealings with man. When He afflicts, it must be from a different motive; namely, the good of the sufferer.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/job/35.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> How much more is God, who is far above all heavens, higher than thou! And therefore God is out of the reach of all profit or loss by thy actions. If thy goodness do not profit thee, it is certain it doth not profit him; and therefore doth not lay any obligation upon him to indulge or recompense thee for it, save only so far as he hath graciously obliged himself; and therefore thou canst not accuse him of injustice for afflicting thee, nor pretend that thou hast deserved better usage from him. And this infinite distance between God and thee should cause thee to think and speak more modestly and reverently of that glorious majesty. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/job/35.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Look unto the heavens, and see,.... The firmament of heaven, in which are the sun and moon and stars: <p>and behold the clouds which are higher than thou; the clouds of the air or sky, which are lower than the starry heavens, yet these were higher than Job, and much more the starry heavens: but because the word has the signification of "thinness", which does not so well agree with the clouds, which are thick substances, condensed air; some take it to be meant of the supreme region of the heavens, which is pure and thin; so Sephorno: and Job is directed to look to these, not as stargazers do, such as are given to judicial astrology, to judge of the fates of men and kingdoms; but rather thereby to be led to the contemplation of God the author of them, and the glorious perfections of his being they display; and chiefly to observe the height of them, that they were out of his reach, and he could neither help them nor hurt them; that he could neither increase nor diminish the light of the celestial bodies, which he could only behold; nor either advance or hinder their course, nor in the least add to or abate their influence and efficacy; and if he could neither be beneficial nor harmful to them, how was it possible that he could be of any advantage or detriment to God, by any actions of his, good or bad, who is higher and out of sight? This is the answer Elihu in general returned, he more particularly replies as follows. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/35.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Look unto the heavens, and see; and behold the <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> clouds <i>which</i> are higher than thou.</span><p>(c) If you cannot control the clouds, will you presume to instruct God?</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/job/35.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5–8</span>. The reply of Elihu to Job’s complaint. A glance at heaven, the infinitely exalted abode of God, must tell us that our conduct whether good or bad cannot affect Him. Our righteousness confers no profit on Him, neither does our wickedness entail any loss. It is men themselves that their conduct affects. It is in human life that the influence of righteousness or evil-doing is seen. And being so eternally unlike they cannot have the same effect.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Elihu does not contemplate any one going so far as to maintain that godliness and unrighteousness do not differ in themselves. Job assumes and most strongly asserts their difference. He even rises to the sublime height of resolving to adhere to righteousness though God and men should shew their indifference to it (ch. <a href="/job/17-9.htm" title="The righteous also shall hold on his way, and he that has clean hands shall be stronger and stronger.">Job 17:9</a>). And what he complains of is that God is indifferent to it, and that in His government the righteous is treated as the wicked. This is the point which Elihu touches.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/35.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Look unto the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds which are higher than thou</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "look to the material sky and heavens, so far above thee and so unapproachable, and judge from them how far the God who made them is above thy puny,  feeble self - how incapable he is of being touched by any of thy doings." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/34.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>33  Shall He recompense it as thou wilt?

Elihu on his part knows that he does not stand alone against Job, the censurer of the divine government of the world, but that men of heart (understanding) and (every) wise man who listens to him will coincide with him in the opinion that Job's talk is devoid of knowledge and intelligence (on the form of writing &#1492;&#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500; as <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-15.htm">Jeremiah 3:15</a>, vid., Ges. 53, rem. 2).<p>In <a href="/job/34-36.htm">Job 34:36</a> we will for the present leave the meaning of &#1488;&#1489;&#1497; undecided; &#1497;&#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1503; is certainly intended as optative: let Job be tried to the extreme or last, i.e., let his trial by affliction continue until the matter is decided (comp. <a href="/habakkuk/1-4.htm">Habakkuk 1:4</a>), on account of the opposition among men of iniquity, i.e., after the manner of such (on this Beth of association comp. &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="/job/36-14.htm">Job 36:14</a>), for to &#1495;&#1496;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514;, by which the purpose of his affliction is to be cleared up, he adds &#1508;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;, viz., the wickedness of blasphemous speeches: among us (therefore without fear) he claps (viz., his hands scornfully together, &#1497;&#1505;&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1511; only here thus absolute instead of &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1508;&#1468;&#1511; &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493; fo dae, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/27-23.htm">Job 27:23</a>, comp. &#1489;&#1513;&#1474;&#1508;&#1511; <a href="/job/36-18.htm">Job 36:18</a> with &#1505;&#1508;&#1511;&#1493; <a href="/job/20-22.htm">Job 20:22</a>)<p>continued...</body></html>
