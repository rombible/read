He first puts it to his conscience whether he thought it could be right to gain his acquittal by an impeachment of God’s justice; yet, he tells him he must have thought after this manner, otherwise he would never have made use of such an atheistical expression as, “that he had no profit by doing his duty, more than if he had sinned;” referring, probably, to <a href="/job/23-11.htm" title="My foot has held his steps, his way have I kept, and not declined.">Job 23:11</a>; <a href="/job/23-15.htm" title="Therefore am I troubled at his presence: when I consider, I am afraid of him.">Job 23:15</a>.

Elihu very probably paused awhile, and waited to observe whether any of the company would rise up, and either contradict and refute what he had said, or declare their assent unto it and approbation of it; or rather to see whether Job would make any reply or not; but perceiving no inclination in him to it, he proceeded to take notice of some other undue expressions of Job, and refute them; one of which is observed in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/35-2.htm">Job 35:2</a>, and the proof of it given in <a href="/job/35-3.htm">Job 35:3</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/35.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Elihu spake moreover, and said,</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/35.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-16.</span> - In this short chapter, once more Elihu addresses himself to Job, first (vers. 1-8) answering his complaint that a life of righteousness has brought him no correspondent blessings; and then (vers. 9-14) explaining to him that his prayers and appeals to God have probably not been answered because they were not preferred in a right spirit, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> with faith and humility. Finally (verb. 15, 16), he condemns Job for haughtiness and arrogance, and reiterates the charge that he "multiplies words without knowledge" (comp. <a href="/job/34-35.htm">Job 34:35-37</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1, 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Elihu spake moreover, and said, Thinkest thou this to be right, that thou saidst, My righteousness is more than God's?</span> Once more it is to be observed that Job had said no such thing.

But Elihu insists on pushing Job's intemperate phrases to their extremest logical issues, and taxing Job with having <span class="accented">said</span> all that his words might seem to a strict logician to involve (compare the comment on Job 34:5, 9). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/34.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>29  If He, however, maketh peace, who will then condemn?<p>And if He hideth His countenance - who then can behold Him? - <p>Both concerning numbers and individuals together:<p>30  That godless men reign not,<p>That they be not nets to the people.<p>31  For one, indeed, saith to God,<p>"I have been proud, I will not do evil;<p>32  "What I see not, show Thou me;<p>"If I have done wrong, I will do it no more"!? - <p>If God makes peace (&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1497;&#1496; as <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/94-13.htm">Psalm 94:13</a>, comp. <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/14-7.htm">Isaiah 14:7</a>, &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1496;&#1492; &#1499;&#1500;&#1470;, viz., after the overthrow of the tyrant) in connection with such crying oppression of the poor, who will then condemn Him without the rather recognising therein His comprehensive justice? The conjecture &#1497;&#1512;&#1506;&#1513;&#1473;<p>(Note: Vid., Grtz in Frankel's Monatsschrift, 1861, i.)<p>is not required either here or <a href="/1_samuel/14-47.htm">1 Samuel 14:47</a> (where &#1492;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1506; signifies to punish the guilty); &#1497;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; is also not to be translated turbabit (Rosenm.), since &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; (Arab. rs&#8219;, rsg) according to its primitive notion does not signify "to be restless, to rage," but "to be relaxed, hollow" (opposite of &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;, Arab. s&#803;dq, to be hard, firm, tight). Further: If God hides His countenance, i.e., is angry and punishes, who can then behold Him, i.e., make Him, the veiled One, visible and claim back the favour withdrawn? The Waw of &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;, if one marks off the periods of the paratactic expression, is in both cases the Waw of conclusion after hypothetical antecedents, and. <a href="/job/34-29.htm">Job 34:29</a> refers to Job's impetuous challenging of God. Thus exalted above human controversy and defiance, God rules both over the mass and over individuals alike. &#1497;&#1495;&#1491; gives intensity of the equality thus correlatively (et-et) expressed (Targ., Syr.); to refer it to &#1488;&#1491;&#1501; as generalizing (lxx, Jer. et super omnes homines), is forbidden by the antithesis of peoples and individuals. To the thought, that God giveth rest (from oppressors) and hides His countenance (from the oppressors and in general those who act wrongly), two co-ordinate negative final clauses are attached: in order that godless men may not rule (&#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1498;, as e.g., <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/23-33.htm">2 Kings 23:33</a>, Keri), in order that they may no longer be (&#1502;( e  equals  &#1502;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514;, under the influence of the notion of putting aside contained in the preceding final clause, therefore like <a href="/isaiah/7-8.htm">Isaiah 7:8</a> &#1502;&#1506;&#1501;, <a href="/isaiah/24-2.htm">Isaiah 24:2</a> &#1502;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512;, <a href="/jeremiah/48-2.htm">Jeremiah 48:2</a> &#1502;&#1490;&#1493;&#1497;, and the like) snares of the people, i.e., those whose evil example and bad government become the ruin of the community.<p>In <a href="/job/34-31.htm">Job 34:31</a> the view of those who by some jugglery concerning the laws of the vowel sounds explain &#1492;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; as imper. Niph. ( equals  &#1492;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;), be it in the sense of &#1500;&#1492;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;, dicendum est (Rosenm., Schlottm., and others, after Raschi), or even in the unheard-of reflexive signification: express thyself (Stick., Hahn), is to be rejected. The syncopated form of the infin. &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1512;&#1490;, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/26-15.htm">Ezekiel 26:15</a>, does not serve as a palliation of this adventurous imperative. It is, on the contrary, &#1488;&#1502;&#1512; with &#1492; interrog., as <a href="/ezekiel/28-9.htm">Ezekiel 28:9</a> &#1492;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;, and probably also &#1492;&#1506;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; <a href="/micah/2-7.htm">Micah 2:7</a> (vid., Hitz.). A direct exhortation to Job to penitence would also not be in place here, although what Elihu says is levelled against Job. The &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; is confirmatory. Thus God acts with that class of unscrupulous men who abuse their power for the destruction of their subjects: for he (one of them) says (or: has said, from the standpoint of the execution of punishment) to God, etc. Ew. differently: "for one says thus to God even: I expiate what I do not commit," by understanding the speech quoted of a defiance which reproachfully demands an explanation. It is, however, manifestly a compendious model confession. And since Elihu with &#1499;&#1497; establishes the execution of punishment from this, that it never entered the mind of the &#1506;&#1491;&#1501; &#1495;&#1504;&#1507; thus to humble himself before God, so &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1514;&#1497; here cannot signify: I have repented (put up with and had to bear what I have deserved); on the contrary, the confession begins with the avowal: I have exalted myself (&#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;, se efferre, in <a href="/hosea/13-1.htm">Hosea 13:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/89-10.htm">Psalm 89:10</a>), which is then followed by the vow: I will not (in the future) do evil (&#1495;&#1489;&#1500; synon. &#1506;&#1493;&#1492;, as <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/1-7.htm">Nehemiah 1:7</a>, and probably also supra, <a href="/job/24-9.htm">Job 24:9</a>), and the entreaty, <a href="/job/34-32.htm">Job 34:32</a> : beside that which I behold (elliptical object-clause, Ew. 333, b), i.e., what lies beyond my vision ( equals  &#1504;&#1505;&#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; or &#1506;&#1500;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="/psalms/19-13.htm">Psalm 19:13</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/90-8.htm">Psalm 90:8</a>, unacknowledged sins), teach me; and the present vow has reference to acknowledged sins and sins that have still to be acknowledged: if I have done wrong, I will do it no more. Thus speaking - Elihu means - those high ones might have anticipated the punishment of the All-just God, for favour instead of wrath cannot be extorted, it is only reached by the way of lowly penitence. </body></html>
