This he knew not how to reconcile the justice of God and his government. Elihu solves the difficulty. Men do not notice the mercies they enjoy in and under their afflictions, nor are thankful for them, therefore they cannot expect that God should deliver them out of affliction. He gives songs in the night; when our condition is dark and melancholy, there is that in God's providence and promise, which is sufficient to support us, and to enable us even to rejoice in tribulation. When we only pore upon our afflictions, and neglect the consolations of God which are treasured up for us, it is just in God to reject our prayers. Even the things that will kill the body, cannot hurt the soul. If we cry to God for the removal of an affliction, and it is not removed, the reason is, not because the Lord's hand is shortened, or his ear heavy; but because we are not sufficiently humbled.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/35.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Surely God will not hear vanity - A vain, hollow, heartless petition. The object of Elihu here is to account for the reason why sufferers are not relieved - having his eye, doubtless, on the case of Job as one of the most remarkable of the kind. The solution which he here gives of the difficulty is, that it is not consistent for God to hear a prayer where there is no sincerity. Of the "truth" of the remark there can be no doubt, but he seems to have taken it for granted that all prayers offered by unrelieved sufferers are thus insincere and hollow. This was needfull in his view to account for the fact under consideration, and this he "assumes" as being unquestionable. Yet the very point indispensable to make out his case was, that "in fact" the prayers offered by such persons were insincere. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/35.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. vanity&#8212;that is, cries uttered in an unhumbled spirit, Job 35:12, which applies in some degree to Job's cries; still more to those of the wicked (Job 27:9; Pr 15:29).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/job/35.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

The combination &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1496; &#1493;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; is like <a href="/psalms/80-15.htm">Psalm 80:15</a> and freq. &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501; (&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1511;, Arab. sh&#803;q, to rub in pieces, make thin, therefore the opposite of &#1506;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501;) are the thin transparent strata of the atmosphere above the hanging clouds. &#1502;&#1503; after &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1492;&#1468; denotes the height that is on the opposite side to the beholder. From the exaltation of God it is then further inferred that it is impossible to exercise any human influence upon Him, by which He might suffer. The pointing wavers here between &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1506;&#1500; (the common fut. form) and &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1506;&#1500;(as a contraction of &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1506;&#1500; after the form &#1488;&#1494;&#1506;&#1501;, <a href="/numbers/23-8.htm">Numbers 23:8</a>). Human wrong or right doing neither diminishes nor increases His blessedness; injury or advantage is only on the side of man, from whom it proceeds. Others, whom his conduct affect, are not included in <a href="/job/35-8.htm">Job 35:8</a> : righteous or ungodly doing, Elihu means to say, as such and with its consequences, belongs solely to the doer himself, the man "like thee" (&#1500;&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; with Munach, &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1498; with Munach), the son of man, i.e., man, capable of evil as of good, and who always, after deciding in favour of the latter or the former, determines his fortune or misfortune, in distinction from God, who ever remains unchangeably the same in His perfect righteousness. What Elihu here says we have already heard from Eliphaz, <a href="/job/22-2.htm">Job 22:2</a>., and Job even expresses himself similarly in <a href="/job/7-20.htm">Job 7:20</a>; but to Elihu's mind it all becomes for Job new and powerful motives to quiet submission, for what objection should Job raise in justification of his complaints concerning his affliction against such sentiments as these, that goodness bears its reward and evil its punishment in itself, and that God's reward of goodness is not a work of indebtedness, nor His punishment of evil a work of necessity? Before such truth he must really hold his peace. </body></html>
