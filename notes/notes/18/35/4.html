It may be doubted, however, whether he was much more successful than Eliphaz had been. The doctrine of the future state, as it is revealed by Christianity, was needful to enable these speakers to comprehend and explain this subject. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/35.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. companions&#8212;those entertaining like sentiments with thee (Job 34:8, 36).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/job/35.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Thy companions, </span> i.e. those who are of thy opinion, or with whom thou dost associate thyself in those speeches and carriages; which seems to be meant not of Job’s three friends, (as many understand it, for their opinions were contrary to Job’s in this point,) but of <span class="ital">wicked men</span>, with whom Job is said to walk and go in company for this same opinion or assertion, <span class="bld"><a href="/job/34-8.htm" title="Which goes in company with the workers of iniquity, and walks with wicked men.">Job 34:8</a>,9</span>. And these men he here calls Job’s companions, partly because they are very forward to harp upon the same string, and to accuse God and justify themselves upon all occasions; and partly that he might awaken Job to a more serious review of his former assertions, by representing to him whose cause he pleaded, and who were his confederates and colleagues in this opinion. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/job/35.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>I will answer thee, and thy companions with thee.
