to reflect that his failings, whatever they were, had not been at all prejudicial to them; but if, on the strength of their general principle, they thought themselves warranted from his sufferings to infer his guilt, he desires them to take notice that this was God’s particular infliction, <a href="/context/job/19-2.htm" title="How long will you vex my soul, and break me in pieces with words?...">Job 19:2-7</a>;

Harsh language from friends, greatly adds to the weight of afflictions: yet it is best not to lay it to heart, lest we harbour resentment. Rather let us look to Him who endured the contradiction of sinners against himself, and was treated with far more cruelty than Job was, or we can be.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked - The conclusion or sum of the whole matter. The meaning is, that the habitations of all that knew not God would be desolate - a declaration which Job could not but regard as aimed at himself; compare <a href="/job/20-29.htm">Job 20:29</a>. This is the close of this harsh and severe speech. It is no wonder that Job should feel it keenly, and that he "did" feel it is apparent from the following chapter. A string of proverbs has been presented, having the appearance of proof, and as the result of the long observation of the course of events, evidently bearing on his circumstances, and so much in point that he could not well deny their pertinency to his condition. He was stung to the quick, and and gave vent to his agonized feelings in the following chapter. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/19.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 19<p>SECOND SERIES.<p>Job 19:1-29.

Next, he proceeds to make his great avowal, prefacing it with a wish for its preservation as a perpetual record (vers. 23, 24); the avowal itself follows (vers. 25-27); and the speech terminates with a warning to his "comforters," that if they continue to persecute him, a judgment will fall upon them (vers. 28, 29). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1, 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then Job answered and said, How long will ye vex my soul, and break me in pieces with words?</span> Job is no Stoic. He is not insensible to his friends' attacks. On the contrary, their words sting him, torture him, "break him in pieces," wound his soul in its tenderest part. Bildad's attack had been the cruellest of all, and it drives him to expostulation (vers. 2-5) and entreaty (vers. 21, 22). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/18.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>16  His roots wither beneath,<p>And above his branch is lopped off.<p>17  His remembrance is vanished from the land,<p>And he hath no name far and wide on the plain;<p>18  They drive him from light into darkness,<p>And chase him out of the world.<p>19  He hath neither offspring nor descendant among his people,<p>Nor is there an escaped one in his dwellings.<p>The evil-doer is represented under the figure of a plant, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/18-16.htm">Job 18:16</a>, as we have had similar figures already, <a href="/job/8-16.htm">Job 8:16</a>., <a href="//biblehub.com/job/15-30.htm">Job 15:30</a>, <a href="/job/15-32.htm">Job 15:32</a>.; <p>(Note: To such biblical figures taken from plants, according to which root and branch are become familiar in the sense of ancestors and descendants (comp. Sir. 23:25, 40:15; Wisd. 4:3-5; <a href="/romans/11-16.htm">Romans 11:16</a>), the arbor consanguineitatis, which is not Roman, but is become common in the Christian refinement of the Roman right, may be traced back; the first trace of this is found in Isidorus Hispalensis (as also the Cabbalistic tree &#1488;&#1497;&#1500;&#1503;, which represents the Sephir-genealogy, has its origin in Spain).)<p>his complete extirpation is like the dying off of the root and of the branch, as <a href="/amos/2-9.htm">Amos 2:9</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/5-24.htm">Isaiah 5:24</a>, and "let him not have a root below and a branch above" in the inscription on the sarcophagus of Eschmunazar. Here we again meet with &#1497;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;, the proper meaning of which is so disputed; it is translated by the Targ. (as by us) as Niph. &#1497;&#1514;&#1502;&#1493;&#1500;&#1500;, but the meaning "to wither" is near at hand, which, as we said on <a href="//biblehub.com/job/14-2.htm">Job 14:2</a>, may be gained as well from the primary notion "to fall to pieces" (whence lxx &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;), as from the primary notion "to parch, dry." &#1488;&#1502;&#1500; (whence &#1488;&#1502;&#1500;&#1500;, formed after the manner of the Arabic IX. form, usually of failing; vid., Caspari, 59) offers a third possible explanation; it signifies originally to be long and lax, to let anything hang down, and thence in Arab. (amala) to hope, i.e., to look out into the distance. Not the evil-doer's family alone is rooted out, but also his memory. With &#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509;, a very relative notion, both the street outside in front of the house (<a href="/job/31-32.htm">Job 31:32</a>), and the pasture beyond the dwelling (<a href="/job/5-10.htm">Job 5:10</a>), are described; here it is to be explained according to <a href="/proverbs/8-26.htm">Proverbs 8:26</a> (&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1493;&#1495;&#1493;&#1510;&#1493;&#1514;), where Hitz. remarks: "The lxx translates correctly &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;. The districts beyond each persons' land, which also belong to no one else, the desert, whither one goes forth, is meant." So &#1488;&#1512;&#1509; seems also here (comp. <a href="/job/30-8.htm">Job 30:8</a>) to denote the land that is regularly inhabited - Job himself is a large proprietor within the range of a city (<a href="/job/29-7.htm">Job 29:7</a>) - and &#1495;&#1493;&#1509; the steppe traversed by the wandering tribes which lies out beyond. Thus also the Syr. version transl. 'al apai barito, over the plain of the desert, after which the Arabic version is el-barr&#305;&#770;je (the synon. of bedw, ba&#770;dije, whence the name of the Beduin<p>(Note: The village with its meadow-land is el-beled wa 'l-berr. The arable land, in distinction from the steppe, is el-ardd el-a&#770;mira, and the steppe is el-berr&#305;&#770;je. If both are intended, ardd can be used alone. Used specially, el-berr&#305;&#770;je is the proper name for the great Syrian desert; hence the proverb: el-hhurr&#305;&#770;je fi 'l-berr&#305;&#775;je, there is freedom in the steppe (not in towns and villages). - Wetzst.)).<p>What is directly said in <a href="/job/18-17.htm">Job 18:17</a> is repeated figuratively in <a href="/job/18-18.htm">Job 18:18</a>; as also what has been figuratively expressed in <a href="/job/18-16.htm">Job 18:16</a> is repeated in <a href="/job/18-19.htm">Job 18:19</a> without figure. The subj. of the verbs in <a href="/job/18-18.htm">Job 18:18</a> remains in the background, as <a href="/job/4-19.htm">Job 4:19</a>; <a href="/psalms/63-11.htm">Psalm 63:11</a>; <a href="/luke/12-20.htm">Luke 12:20</a> : they thrust him out of the light (of life, prosperity, and fame) into the darkness (of misfortune, death, and oblivion); so that the illustris becomes not merely ignobilis, but totally ignotus, and they hunt him forth (&#1497;&#1504;&#1491;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; from the Hiph. &#1492;&#1504;&#1491; of the verb &#1504;&#1491;&#1491;, instead of which it might also be &#1497;&#1504;&#1491;&#1492;&#1493; from &#1504;&#1491;&#1468;&#1492;, they banish him) out of the habitable world (for this is the signification of &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500;, the earth as built upon and inhabited). There remains to him in his race neither sprout nor shoot; thus the rhyming alliteration &#1504;&#1497;&#1503; and &#1504;&#1499;&#1491; (according to Luzzatto on <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/14-22.htm">Isaiah 14:22</a>, used only of the descendants of persons in high rank, and certainly a nobler expression than our rhyming pairs: Germ. Stumpf und Stiel, Mann und Maus, Kind und Kegel). And there is no escaped one (as <a href="/deuteronomy/2-34.htm">Deuteronomy 2:34</a> and freq., Arab. sha&#770;rid, one fleeing; sharu&#770;d, a fugitive) in his abodes (&#1502;&#1490;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, as only besides <a href="/psalms/55-16.htm">Psalm 55:16</a>). Thus to die away without descendant and remembrance is still at the present day among the Arab races that profess D&#305;&#770;n Ibra&#770;h&#305;&#770;m (the religion of Abraham) the most unhappy thought, for the point of gravitation of continuance beyond the grave is transferred by them to the immortality of the righteous in the continuance of his posterity and works in this world (vid., supra, p. 386); and where else should it be at the time of Job, since no revelation had as yet drawn the curtain aside from the future world? Now follows the declamatory conclusion of the speech. </body></html>
