What is the fire of hell but the wrath of God! Seared consciences will feel it hereafter, but do not fear it now: enlightened consciences fear it now, but shall not feel it hereafter. It is a very common mistake to think that those whom God afflicts he treats as his enemies. Every creature is that to us which God makes it to be; yet this does not excuse Job's relations and friends. How uncertain is the friendship of men! but if God be our Friend, he will not fail us in time of need. What little reason we have to indulge the body, which, after all our care, is consumed by diseases it has in itself. Job recommends himself to the compassion of his friends, and justly blames their harshness. It is very distressing to one who loves God, to be bereaved at once of outward comfort and of inward consolation; yet if this, and more, come upon a believer, it does not weaken the proof of his being a child of God and heir of glory.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I called my servant - He lost all respect for me, and paid me no attention.<p>I entreated him - I ceased to expect "obedience," and tried to see what "persuasion" would do.

His manservant, whom he had hired into his house, and who waited upon his person, and had been his trusty and faithful servant, and was dear unto him, and he had shown him much respect and kindness in the time of his prosperity; him he called to him, to do this and that and the other thing for him as usual; and of whose assistance and service he might stand in more need, being so greatly afflicted in body as well as in other things; and who ought to have been obedient to his call in all things, and have served him with all readiness and cheerfulness, with all heartiness, sincerity, integrity, and faithfulness; and given him the same honour and reverence as before; but instead of all this, it is observed, <p>and he gave me no answer; whether he would or would not do what he ordered him to do; he took no notice of him, he turned a deaf ear to him, and his back upon him; he came not near him, but kept his place where he was, or walked off without showing any regard to what he said to him; he neither answered him by words, nor by deeds; neither signified his readiness to do what he was ordered, nor did it. In some cases it is criminal in servants to answer again, when they thwart and contradict their masters, or reply in a saucy, surly, and impudent manner; but when they are spoke to about their master's business, it becomes them to answer in a decent, humble, and respectable way, declaring their readiness to do their master's will and pleasure: <p>I entreated him with my mouth; which is an aggravation of his insolence and disobedience; such was the low condition Job was reduced unto, and such the humility of his mind under his present circumstances, that he laid aside the authority of a master, and only entreated his servant, and begged it as if it was a favour, to do this or the other for him; nor did he signify this by a look and cast of his eye, or by a nod of his head, or by the direction of his hand; but with his mouth he spake unto him, and let him know what he would have done; and this not in an authoritative, haughty, and imperious manner; but with good words, and in submissive language, as it was something he was beholden to his servant for, rather than obedience to be performed. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/19.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">I called my servant, and he gave me no answer; I intreated him with my mouth.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I called my servant, and he gave me no answer</span>.

He finds, however, neither with God nor among men any response of sympathy and help; he cries for help (which &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;, perhaps connected with &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;, Arab. s&#8219;t, from &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;, Arab. ws&#8219;, seems to signify), without justice, i.e., the right of an impartial hearing and verdict, being attainable by him. He is like a prisoner who is confined to a narrow space (comp. <a href="/job/3-23.htm">Job 3:23</a>; <a href="/job/13-27.htm">Job 13:27</a>) and has no way out, since darkness is laid upon him wherever he may go. One is here reminded of <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/3-7.htm">Lamentations 3:7-9</a>; and, in fact, this speech generally stands in no accidental mutual relation to the lamentations of Jeremiah. The "crown of my head" has also its parallel in <a href="/lamentations/5-16.htm">Lamentations 5:16</a>; that which was Job's greatest ornament and most costly jewel is meant. According to <a href="//biblehub.com/job/29-14.htm">Job 29:14</a>, &#1510;&#1491;&#1511; and &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1496; were his robe and diadem. These robes of honour God has stripped from him, this adornment more precious than a regal diadem He has taken from him since, i.e., his affliction puts him down as a transgressor, and abandons him to the insult of those around him. God destroyed him roundabout (destruxit), as a house that is broken down on all sides, and lifted out as a tree his hope. &#1492;&#1505;&#1468;&#1497;&#1506; does not in itself signify to root out, but only to lift out (<a href="//biblehub.com/job/4-21.htm">Job 4:21</a>, of the tent-cord, and with it the tent-pin) of a plant: to remove it from the ground in which it has grown, either to plant it elsewhere, as <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/80-9.htm">Psalm 80:9</a>, or as here, to put it aside. The ground was taken away from his hope, so that its greenness faded away like that of a tree that is rooted up. The fut. consec. is here to be translated: then I perished (different from <a href="/job/14-20.htm">Job 14:20</a> : and consequently he perishes); he is now already one who is passed away, his existence is only the shadow of life. God has caused, fut. Hiph. apoc. &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1495;&#1512;, His wrath to kindle against him, and regarded him in relation to Himself as His opponents, therefore as one of them. Perhaps, however, the expression is intentionally intensified here, in contrast with <a href="/job/13-24.htm">Job 13:24</a> : he, the one, is accounted by God as the host of His foes; He treats him as if all hostility to God were concentrated in him. </body></html>
