What is the fire of hell but the wrath of God! Seared consciences will feel it hereafter, but do not fear it now: enlightened consciences fear it now, but shall not feel it hereafter. It is a very common mistake to think that those whom God afflicts he treats as his enemies. Every creature is that to us which God makes it to be; yet this does not excuse Job's relations and friends. How uncertain is the friendship of men! but if God be our Friend, he will not fail us in time of need. What little reason we have to indulge the body, which, after all our care, is consumed by diseases it has in itself. Job recommends himself to the compassion of his friends, and justly blames their harshness. It is very distressing to one who loves God, to be bereaved at once of outward comfort and of inward consolation; yet if this, and more, come upon a believer, it does not weaken the proof of his being a child of God and heir of glory.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>All my inward friends - Margin, "the men of my secret." The meaning is those, who were admitted to the intimacy of friendship or who were permitted to be acquainted with his secret thoughts, purposes, and plans. The word uses here (&#1505;&#1493;&#1491;  so&#770;d) denotes properly "a couch, cushions, pillow," on which one reclines; then a "divan," a circle of persons sitting together for consultation or conversation; and hence, it refers to those who are sitting together in intimate counsel, (see <a href="//biblehub.com/job/15-8.htm">Job 15:8</a>, note; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/29-4.htm">Job 29:4</a>, note) and then familiar conversation, intimacy. Here the phrase "men of my intimacy" (&#1505;&#1493;&#1491;&#1497;  so&#770;d&#305;&#770;y) denotes those who were admitted to intimate friendship.

The saints of God in all ages, and however differently circumstanced, are assailed by almost the same trials and temptations. Whether it be Job, or David, or Jeremiah, or One greater than any of them, the desertion and unkindness of their nearest and dearest, as the bitterest of all sufferings, is almost sure to be included in their cup, which they must drink to the dregs, if they are to experience to the full "the precious uses of adversity." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/19.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>12  His troops came together,<p>And threw up their way against me,<p>And encamped round about my tent.<p>13  My brethren hath He removed far from me,<p>And my acquaintance are quite estranged from me.<p>14  My kinsfolk fail,<p>And those that knew me have forgotten me.<p>15  The slaves of my house and my maidens,<p>They regard me as a stranger,<p>I am become a perfect stranger in their eyes.<p>It may seem strange that we do not connect <a href="/job/19-12.htm">Job 19:12</a> with the preceding strophe or group of verses; but between <a href="/job/19-7.htm">Job 19:7</a> and <a href="/job/19-21.htm">Job 19:21</a> there are thirty &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;, which, in connection with the arrangement of the rest of this speech in decastichs (accidentally coinciding remarkably with the prominence given to the number ten in <a href="/job/19-3.htm">Job 19:3</a>), seem intended to be divided into three decastichs, and can be so divided without doing violence to the connection. While in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/19-12.htm">Job 19:12</a>, in connection with <a href="//biblehub.com/job/19-11.htm">Job 19:11</a>, Job describes the course of the wrath, which he has to withstand as if he were an enemy of God, in <a href="/job/19-13.htm">Job 19:13</a>. he refers back to the degradation complained of in <a href="/job/19-9.htm">Job 19:9</a>. In <a href="/job/19-12.htm">Job 19:12</a> he compares himself to a besieged (perhaps on account of revolt) city. God's &#1490;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; (not: bands of marauders, as Dietr. interprets, but: troops, i.e., of regular soldiers, synon. of &#1510;&#1489;&#1488;, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/10-17.htm">Job 10:17</a>, comp. <a href="/job/25-3.htm">Job 25:3</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/29-25.htm">Job 29:25</a>, from the root &#1490;&#1491;, to unite, join, therefore prop. the assembled, a heap; vid., Frst's Handwrterbuch) are the bands of outwards and inward sufferings sent forth against him for a combined attack (&#1497;&#1495;&#1491;). Heaping up a way, i.e., by filling up the ramparts, is for the purpose of making the attack upon the city with battering-rams (<a href="/job/16-14.htm">Job 16:14</a>) and javelins, and then the storm, more effective (on this erection of offensive ramparts (approches), called elsewhere &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1498; &#1505;&#1500;&#1500;&#1492;, vid., Keil's Archologie, 159). One result of this condition of siege in which God's wrath has placed him is that he is avoided and despised as one smitten of God: neither love and fidelity, nor obedience and dependence, meet him from any quarter. What he has said in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/17-6.htm">Job 17:6</a>, that he is become a byword and an abomination (an object to spit upon), he here describes in detail. There is no ground for understanding &#1488;&#1495;&#1497; in the wider sense of relations; brethren is meant here, as in <a href="/psalms/69-9.htm">Psalm 69:9</a>. He calls his relations &#1511;&#1512;&#1493;&#1489;&#1497;, as <a href="/psalms/38-12.htm">Psalm 38:12</a>. &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1497; are (in accordance with the pregnant biblical use of this word in the sense of nosse cum affectu et effectu) those who know him intimately (with objective suff. as <a href="/psalms/87-4.htm">Psalm 87:4</a>), and &#1502;&#1497;&#1491;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497;, as <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/31-12.htm">Psalm 31:12</a>, and freq., those intimately known to him; both, therefore, so-called heart-or bosom-friends. &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497; &#1490;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497; Jer. well translates inquilinin domus meae; they are, in distinction from those who by birth belong to the nearer and wider circle of the family, persons who are received into this circle as servants, as vassals (comp. <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/3-22.htm">Exodus 3:22</a>, and Arabic ja&#770;r, an associate, one sojourning in a strange country under the protection of its government, a neighbour), here espec. the domestics. The verb &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; (Ges. 60) is construed with the nearest feminine subject. These people, who ought to thank him for taking them into his house, regard him as one who does not belong to it (&#1494;&#1512;); he is looked upon by them as a perfect stranger (&#1504;&#1499;&#1512;&#1497;), as an intruder from another country. </body></html>
