Houbigant translates the verse, <span class="ital">My wife abhors even my breath: the children of my body fly far from my offensive smell: </span>and he observes, that “we are nowhere told that all the children of Job perished, but only such as were feasting in their eldest brother’s house.” It must be observed, however, that when the messenger informed Job of the destruction of his family, the answer which he gave, namely, <span class="ital">Naked came I,</span> &c., supposes that there were none who survived that calamity. Some are of opinion that those whom Job calls his children were grandchildren. The LXX. take them for the children of concubines. Sol. Jarchi supposes they were his domestics: but the Hebrew text here does not necessarily imply that there were any children of his then in existence. For there is nothing for the word <span class="ital">sake; </span>it is literally, <span class="ital">I entreated for the children of my body, </span>which may mean, as interpreted above, for, or by the memory of our children, namely, the children now dead. The general interpretation here supposes that Job’s breath, by reason of his sores and ulcers, was so offensive that his wife could not bear to come near him; but the words do not necessarily imply that: for, as he had just said before, <span class="ital">I entreated </span>my servant <span class="ital">with my mouth; </span>so, when he immediately adds, <span class="ital">My breath is strange: </span>&c., he might mean no more than that his breath or voice was strange also to his wife: that is, she had as little regard to what he said as the servant who gave him no answer when he was called. See Chappelow, who thus paraphrases the passage: “When my servant gave no attention, I called to my wife; but neither did she regard me, though I particularly mentioned to her (as an aggravation of my calamities, and to move her compassion) the loss of my children, whom I had begotten.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/job/19.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>19:8-22 How doleful are Job's complaints! What is the fire of hell but the wrath of God! Seared consciences will feel it hereafter, but do not fear it now: enlightened consciences fear it now, but shall not feel it hereafter. It is a very common mistake to think that those whom God afflicts he treats as his enemies. Every creature is that to us which God makes it to be; yet this does not excuse Job's relations and friends. How uncertain is the friendship of men! but if God be our Friend, he will not fail us in time of need. What little reason we have to indulge the body, which, after all our care, is consumed by diseases it has in itself. Job recommends himself to the compassion of his friends, and justly blames their harshness. It is very distressing to one who loves God, to be bereaved at once of outward comfort and of inward consolation; yet if this, and more, come upon a believer, it does not weaken the proof of his being a child of God and heir of glory.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>My breath is strange to my wife - Schultens renders this, "my breath is loathsome to my wife," and so also Noyes. Wemyss translates it, "my own wife turns aside from my breath." Dr Good, "my breath is scattered away by my wife." The literal meaning is, "my breath is "strange" (&#1494;&#1512;&#1492;  za&#770;ra&#770;h) to my wife;" and the idea is, that there had been such a change in him from his disease, that his breath was not that which she had been accustomed to breathe without offence, and that she now turned away from it as if it were the breath of a stranger. Jerome renders it, "Halitum meum exhorruit uxor mea - my wife abhors my breath." It may be worthy of remark here, that but "one" wife of Job is mentioned - a remarkable fact, as he probably lived in an age when polygamy was common.<p>I entreated her - I appealed to her by all that was tender in the domestic relation, but in vain. From this it would seem that even his wife had regarded him as an object of divine displeasure and had also left him to suffer alone.<p>For the children's sake of mine own body - Margin, "my belly." There is consideralbe variety in the interpretation of this passage. The word rendered "my own body" (&#1489;&#1496;&#1504;&#1497;  bet&#803;en&#305;&#770;y) means literally, "my belly or womb;" and Noyes, Gesenius, and some others, suppose it means the children of his own mother! But assuredly this was scarcely an appeal that Job would be likely to make to his wife in such circumstances. There can be no impropriety in supposing that Job referred to himself, and that the word is used somewhat in the same sense as the word "loins" is in <a href="/genesis/35-11.htm">Genesis 35:11</a>; <a href="/genesis/46-26.htm">Genesis 46:26</a>; <a href="/exodus/1-5.htm">Exodus 1:5</a>; <a href="/1_kings/8-19.htm">1 Kings 8:19</a>. Thus, understood, it would refer to his own children, and the appeal to his wife was founded on the relation which they had sustainded to them. Though they were now dead, he referred to their former united attachment to them, to the common affliction which they had experienced in their loss; and in view of all their former love to them, and all the sorrow which they had experienced in their death, he made an appeal to his wife to show him kindness, but in vain. Jerome renders this, "Orabam filios uteri mei." The Septuagint, not understanding it, and trying to "make" sense of it, introduced a statement which is undoubtedly false, though Rosenmuller accords with it. "I called affectionately (&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;  kolakeuo&#772;n) the sons of my concubines" - &#x3c5;&#x3b9;&#788;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;  huious pallakido&#772;n mou. But the whole meaning is evidently that he made a solemn and tender appeal to his wife, in view of all the joys and sorrows which they had experience as the united head of a family of now no more. What would reach the heart of an estranged wife, if such an appeal would not? <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/19.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17. strange&#8212;His breath by elephantiasis had become so strongly altered and offensive, that his wife turned away as estranged from him (Job 19:13; 17:1).<p>children's &#8230; of mine own body&#8212;literally, "belly." But "loins" is what we should expect, not "belly" (womb), which applies to the woman. The "mine" forbids it being taken of his wife. Besides their children were dead. In Job 3:10 the same words "my womb" mean, my mother's womb: therefore translate, "and I must entreat (as a suppliant) the children of my mother's womb"; that is, my own brothers&#8212;a heightening of force, as compared with last clause of Job 19:16 [Umbreit]. Not only must I entreat suppliantly my servant, but my own brothers (Ps 69:8). Here too, he unconsciously foreshadows Jesus Christ (Joh 7:5).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/job/19.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">To my wife; </span> who by reason of the stink of my breath and sores denied me her company. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">For the children’s sake of mine own body; </span> by these pledges of our mutual and matrimonial tie and affection, the children which came out of my loins, and were begotten by me upon her body. But divers render the words thus, <span class="ital">and I entreated the children of my own body</span>, i.e. either some of Job’s younger children, who by reason of their tender years were kept at home with their father, when their elder brethren and sisters were gone abroad to the feast; or some of his grandchildren by those grown sons and daughters; for such also oft come under the name of <span class="ital">children</span>. But this sense seems not so proper, partly because according to that translation here is mention only of Job’s entreating them, but not a word of their denying his request; which is the only matter of his present complaint; and partly because according to the former translation it is a great and just aggravation of his wife’s unkindness, and exactly answers to the foregoing verse, where the servant’s perverseness is aggravated in the same manner, and by part of the same words. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/job/19.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>My breath is strange to my wife,.... Being corrupt and unsavoury, through some internal disorder; see <a href="/job/17-1.htm">Job 17:1</a>; so that she could not bear to come nigh him, to do any kind deed for him; but if this was his case, and his natural breath was so foul, his friends would not have been able to have been so long in the same room with him, and carry on so long a conversation with him; rather therefore it may signify the words of his mouth, his speech along with his breath, which were very disagreeable to his wife; when upon her soliciting him to curse God and die, he told her she talked like one of the foolish women; and when he taught her to expect evil as well as good at the hand of God, and to bear afflictions patiently, or else the sense may be, "my spirit" (f), his vital spirit, his life, was wearisome and loathsome to his wife; she was tired out with him, with hearing his continual groans and complaints, and wished to be rid of him, and that God would take away his life: or else, as some render it, "my spirit is strange to me, because of my wife" (g); and then the meaning is, that Job was weary of his own life, he loathed it, and could have been glad to have it taken from him, because of the scoffs and jeers of his wife at him, her brawls and quarrels with him, and solicitations of him to curse God and renounce religion: <p>though I entreated her for the children's sake of mine own body; this clause creates a difficulty with interpreters, since it is generally thought all Job's children were dead. Some think that only his elder children were destroyed at once, and that he had younger ones at home with him, which he here refers to; but this does not appear: others suppose these were children of his concubines; but this wants proof that he had any concubine; and besides an entreaty for the sake of such children could have no influence upon his proper wife: others take them for grandchildren, and who, indeed, are sometimes called children; but then they could not with strict propriety be called the children of his body; and for the same reason it cannot be meant of such that were brought up in his house, as if they were his children; nor such as were his disciples, or attended on him for instruction: but this may respect not any children then living, but those he had had; and the sense is, that Job entreated his wife, not for the use of the marriage bed, as some suggest (h); for it can hardly be thought, that, in such circumstances in which he was, there should be any desire of this kind; but to do some kind deed for him, as the dressing of his ulcers, &amp;c. or such things which none but a wife could do well for him; and this he entreated for the sake of the children he had had by her, those pledges of their conjugal affection; or rather, since the word has the signification of deploring, lamenting, and bemoaning, the clause may be thus rendered, "and I lamented the children of my body" (i); he had none of those indeed to afflict him; and his affliction was, that they were taken away from him at once in such a violent manner; and therefore he puts in this among his family trials; or this may be an aggravation of his wife's want of tenderness and respect unto him; that his breath should be unsavoury, his talk disagreeable, and his sighs and moans be wearisome to her, when the burden of his song, the subject of his sorrowful complaints, was the loss of his children; in which it might have been thought she would have joined with him, being equally concerned therein. <p>(f) "spiritus meus", Junius &amp; Tremellius, Vatablus, Schmidt, Schultens; "anima mea", Cocceius.

As he has other servants he might have other children. These might be children of concubines, as Job lived in the patriarchal age, though no allusion is made to such connexions, and the references to his wife are of such a kind as to suggest that Job lived in a state of strict monogamy. Or the expression “children of my body” might be used somewhat loosely to mean grandchildren—children of his sons. The impression conveyed by the Prologue is that the seven sons were unmarried, though this is left uncertain. Others consider the phrase “children of my womb” to mean, children of my mother—children of the same womb with myself.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My breath is strange to my wife</span>.

He finds, however, neither with God nor among men any response of sympathy and help; he cries for help (which &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;, perhaps connected with &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;, Arab. s&#8219;t, from &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;, Arab. ws&#8219;, seems to signify), without justice, i.e., the right of an impartial hearing and verdict, being attainable by him.

One is here reminded of <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/3-7.htm">Lamentations 3:7-9</a>; and, in fact, this speech generally stands in no accidental mutual relation to the lamentations of Jeremiah. The "crown of my head" has also its parallel in <a href="/lamentations/5-16.htm">Lamentations 5:16</a>; that which was Job's greatest ornament and most costly jewel is meant.

The ground was taken away from his hope, so that its greenness faded away like that of a tree that is rooted up. The fut. consec. is here to be translated: then I perished (different from <a href="/job/14-20.htm">Job 14:20</a> : and consequently he perishes); he is now already one who is passed away, his existence is only the shadow of life. God has caused, fut. Hiph. apoc. &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1495;&#1512;, His wrath to kindle against him, and regarded him in relation to Himself as His opponents, therefore as one of them. Perhaps, however, the expression is intentionally intensified here, in contrast with <a href="/job/13-24.htm">Job 13:24</a> : he, the one, is accounted by God as the host of His foes; He treats him as if all hostility to God were concentrated in him. </body></html>
