Were any of the saints or servants of God visited with such Divine judgments as Job, or did they ever behave like him under their sufferings? The term, saints, holy, or more strictly, consecrated ones, seems in all ages to have been applied to the people of God, through the Sacrifice slain in the covenant of their reconciliation. Eliphaz doubts not that the sin of sinners directly tends to their ruin. They kill themselves by some lust or other; therefore, no doubt, Job has done some foolish thing, by which he has brought himself into this condition. The allusion was plain to Job's former prosperity; but there was no evidence of Job's wickedness, and the application to him was unfair and severe.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>His children are far from safety - That is, this is soon manifest by their being cut off or subjected to calamity. The object of Eliphaz is, to state the result of his own observation, and to show how calamity overtook the wicked though they even prospered for a time. He begins with that which a man would feel most - the calamity which comes upon his children, and says that God would punish him in them. Every word of this would go to the heart of Job; for he could not but feel that it was aimed at him, and that the design was to prove that the calamities that had come upon his children were a proof of his own wickedness and of the divine displeasure. It is remarkable that Job listens to this with the utmost patience. There is no interruption of the speaker; no breaking in upon the argument of his friend; no mark of uneasiness. Oriental politeness required that a speaker should be heard attentively through whatever he might say. See the Introduction, Section 7. Cutting and severe, therefore, as this strain of remark must have been, the sufferer sat meekly and heard it all, and waited for the appropriate time when an answer might be returned.<p>And they are crushed in the gate - The gate of a city in ancient times was the chief place of concourse, and was the place where public business was usually transacted, and where courts of justice were held; see <a href="/genesis/23-10.htm">Genesis 23:10</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/21-19.htm">Deuteronomy 21:19</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/25-6.htm">Deuteronomy 25:6-7</a>; <a href="/ruth/4-1.htm">Ruth 4:1</a> ff: <a href="/psalms/127-5.htm">Psalm 127:5</a>; <a href="/proverbs/22-22.htm">Proverbs 22:22</a>. The Greeks also held their courts in some public place of business. Hence, the forum, &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;  agora, was also a place for fairs. See Jahn's Archaeology, section 247. Some suppose that the meaning here is, that they were oppressed and trodden down by the concourse in the gate. But the more probable meaning is, that they found no one to advocate their cause; that they were subject to oppression and injustice in judicial decisions, and then when their parent was dead, no one would stand up to vindicate them from respect to his memory. The idea is, that though there might be temporary prosperity, yet that it would not be long before heavy calamities would come upon the children of the wicked. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. His children &#8230; crushed in the gate&#8212;A judicial formula. The gate was the place of judgment and of other public proceedings (Ps 127:5; Pr 22:22; Ge 23:10; De 21:19). Such propyl&aelig;a have been found in the Assyrian remains.

The sins of the fathers arc visited upon the children. Eliphaz makes covert allusion to the death of Job's children (<a href="/job/1-19.htm">Job 1:19</a>). Feeling, however, that he is on delicate ground, he goes on into details which in no way fit their case. <span class="cmt_word">And</span> (he says) <span class="cmt_word">they are crushed in the gate</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> they are oppressed, crushed, by litigations. The house once smitten of God, human beasts of prey enter in; claims are made against the children; lawsuits commenced; all the arts of chicanery set in motion; every effort made to strip them of their last penny. (For the sense here assigned to "the gate," see <a href="/job/29-7.htm">Job 29:7</a> and Job 31:21.) <span class="cmt_word">Neither is there any to deliver them</span>. No one intercedes on their behalf, undertakes their detente in the courts, or makes any effort to avert their ruin. This picture of legal oppression accords very closely with what we know of the East in all ages (comp. <a href="/isaiah/1-17.htm">Isaiah 1:17, 23</a>; <a href="/isaiah/3-14.htm">Isaiah 3:14, 15</a>; <a href="/isaiah/5-23.htm">Isaiah 5:23</a>; <a href="/isaiah/10-2.htm">Isaiah 10:2</a>, etc.). Oriental cowardice causes men to shrink from casting in their lot with those whom Misfortune has marked as her own. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>&#1488;&#1507; signifies, like &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1488;&#1507;, quanto minus, or quanto magis, according as a negative or positive sentence precedes: since <a href="/job/4-18.htm">Job 4:18</a> is positive, we translate it here quanto magis, as <a href="/2_samuel/16-11.htm">2 Samuel 16:11</a>. Men are called dwellers in clay houses: the house of clay is their &#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;, as being taken de limo terrae (<a href="/job/33-6.htm">Job 33:6</a>; comp. Wis. 9:15); it is a fragile habitation, formed of inferior materials, and destined to destruction. The explanation which follows - those whose &#1497;&#1505;&#1493;&#1491;, i.e., foundation of existence, is in dust - shows still more clearly that the poet has <a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/3-19.htm">Genesis 3:19</a>, in his mind. It crushes them (subject, everything that operates destructively on the life of man) &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1470;&#1506;&#1513;&#1473;, i.e., not: sooner than the moth is crushed (Hahn), or more rapidly than a moth destroys (Oehler, Fries), or even appointed to the moth for destruction (Schlottm.); but &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497; signifies, as <a href="/job/3-24.htm">Job 3:24</a> (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/1-16.htm">1 Samuel 1:16</a>), ad instar: as easily as a moth is crushed. They last only from morning until evening: they are broken in pieces (&#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1514;, from &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1514;, for &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1514;); they are therefore as ephemerae. They perish for ever, without any one taking it to heart (suppl. &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1500;&#1489;, <a href="/isaiah/42-25.htm">Isaiah 42:25</a>; <a href="/isaiah/57-1.htm">Isaiah 57:1</a>), or directing the heart towards it, animum advertit (suppl. &#1500;&#1489;, <a href="/job/1-8.htm">Job 1:8</a>).<p>In <a href="/job/4-21.htm">Job 4:21</a> the soul is compared to the cord of a tent, which stretches out and holds up the body as a tent, like <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:6</a>, with a silver cord, which holds the lamp hanging from the covering of the tent. Olshausen is inclined to read &#1497;&#1514;&#1491;&#1501;, their tent-pole, instead of &#1497;&#1514;&#1512;&#1501;, and at any rate thinks the accompanying &#1489;&#1468;&#1501; superfluous and awkward. But (1) the comparison used here of the soul, and of the life sustained by it, corresponds to its comparison elsewhere with a thread or weft, of which death is the cutting through or loosing (<a href="/job/6-9.htm">Job 6:9</a>; <a href="/job/27-8.htm">Job 27:8</a>; <a href="/isaiah/38-12.htm">Isaiah 38:12</a>); (12) &#1489;&#1468;&#1501; is neither superfluous nor awkward, since it is intended to say, that their duration of life falls in all at once like a tent when that which in them (&#1489;&#1501;) corresponds to the cord of a tent (i.e., the &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;) is drawn away from it. The relation of the members of the sentence in <a href="/job/4-21.htm">Job 4:21</a> is just the same as in <a href="/job/4-2.htm">Job 4:2</a> : Will they not die when it is torn away, etc. They then die off in lack of wisdom, i.e., without having acted in accordance with the perishableness of their nature and their distance from God; therefore, rightly considered: unprepared and suddenly, comp. <a href="/job/36-12.htm">Job 36:12</a>; <a href="/proverbs/5-23.htm">Proverbs 5:23</a>. Oehler, correctly: without having been made wiser by the afflictions of God. The utterance of the Spirit, the compass of which is unmistakeably manifest by the strophic division, ends here. Eliphaz now, with reference to it, turns to Job. </body></html>
