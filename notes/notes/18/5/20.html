Eliphaz might think that Job feared perishing by want, as being so poor, that he needed the contributions of his friends for his relief. <span class="ital">And in war from the sword </span>— These things he utters with more confidence, because the rewards or punishments of this life were more constantly distributed to men in the Old Testament, according to their good or bad behaviour, than they are now: and, because it was his opinion, that great afflictions were the certain evidences of wickedness; and, consequently, that great deliverances would infallibly follow upon true repentance.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/job/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:17-27 Eliphaz gives to Job a word of caution and exhortation: Despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty. Call it a chastening, which comes from the Father's love, and is for the child's good; and notice it as a messenger from Heaven. Eliphaz also encourages Job to submit to his condition. A good man is happy though he be afflicted, for he has not lost his enjoyment of God, nor his title to heaven; nay, he is happy because he is afflicted. Correction mortifies his corruptions, weans his heart from the world, draws him nearer to God, brings him to his Bible, brings him to his knees. Though God wounds, yet he supports his people under afflictions, and in due time delivers them. Making a wound is sometimes part of a cure. Eliphaz gives Job precious promises of what God would do for him, if he humbled himself. Whatever troubles good men may be in, they shall do them no real harm. Being kept from sin, they are kept from the evil of trouble. And if the servants of Christ are not delivered from outward troubles, they are delivered by them, and while overcome by one trouble, they conquer all. Whatever is maliciously said against them shall not hurt them. They shall have wisdom and grace to manage their concerns. The greatest blessing, both in our employments and in our enjoyments, is to be kept from sin. They shall finish their course with joy and honour. That man lives long enough who has done his work, and is fit for another world. It is a mercy to die seasonably, as the corn is cut and housed when fully ripe; not till then, but then not suffered to stand any longer. Our times are in God's hands; it is well they are so. Believers are not to expect great wealth, long life, or to be free from trials. But all will be ordered for the best. And remark from Job's history, that steadiness of mind and heart under trial, is one of the highest attainments of faith. There is little exercise for faith when all things go well. But if God raises a storm, permits the enemy to send wave after wave, and seemingly stands aloof from our prayers, then, still to hang on and trust God, when we cannot trace him, this is the patience of the saints. Blessed Saviour! how sweet it is to look unto thee, the Author and Finisher of faith, in such moments!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In famine he shall redeem thee - That is, will deliver thee from death. On the meaning of the word "redeem," see the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/43-1.htm">Isaiah 43:1</a>, <a href="/isaiah/43-3.htm">Isaiah 43:3</a>.<p>From the power of the sword - Margin, as in Hebrew "hands." That is, he should not be slain by armed men. A mouth is often attributed to the sword in the Scriptures, because it devours; "hands" are attributed to it here, because it is by the hand that we perform an undertaking, and the sword is personified, and represented as acting as a conscious agent; compare <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-5.htm">Ezekiel 35:5</a>, margin. The meaning is that God would protect those who put their trust in him, in times of calamity and war. Doubtless Eliphaz had seen instances enough of this kind to lead him to this general conclusion, where the pious poor had been protected in a remarkable manner, and where signal deliverances had been vouchsafed to the righteous in danger. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20. power&#8212;(Jer 5:12).

In a time of extreme want of provisions, God so cares for his own dear people, that they shall not be starved to death by the famine; so in the famine in Egypt, which the Targum takes notice of, in the times of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, and the patriarchs, there was food provided for them, so that they and their families were sustained, and perished not for lack of the necessaries of life: God sometimes goes out of his ordinary way, and works wonders for his poor and needy in distress, when they cry unto him; see <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/41-17.htm">Isaiah 41:17</a>, <p>and in war from the power of the sword; or, "from the hands of the sword" (f): from swords in hand, when drawn, and men are ready to push with them with all their force; as he delivered and preserved Abraham from the sword of the four kings, when he waged war with them, <a href="/genesis/14-20.htm">Genesis 14:20</a>; and the Israelites, in the war of Amalek, in the times of Moses, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/17-8.htm">Exodus 17:8</a>, which the Targum here refers to; and David from the harmful sword of Goliath, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-46.htm">1 Samuel 17:46</a>, and others with whom he was concerned in war: and so the Lord covers the heads of his people in the day of battle oftentimes, when multitudes fall on their right hand and on their left. <p>(f)  "de manu gladii", V.

It is meant that they accomplish nothing that has actual duration and advantage. <a href="/job/5-13.htm">Job 5:13</a> cannot be better translated than by Paul, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-19.htm">1 Corinthians 3:19</a>, who here deviates from the lxx.

Bttch. translates: without sword, i.e., instrument of power (comp. <a href="/job/9-15.htm">Job 9:15</a>; <a href="/job/21-9.htm">Job 21:9</a>); but &#1502;&#1503; with &#1495;&#1512;&#1489; leads one to expect that that from which one is rescued is to be described (comp. <a href="/job/5-20.htm">Job 5:20</a>). Ewald corrects &#1502;&#1495;&#1512;&#1489;, which Olsh. thinks acute: it is, however, unhebraic, according to our present knowledge of the usage of the language; for the passives of &#1495;&#1512;&#1489; are used of cities, countries, and peoples, but not of individual men.
