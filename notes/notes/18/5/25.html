Call it a chastening, which comes from the Father's love, and is for the child's good; and notice it as a messenger from Heaven. Eliphaz also encourages Job to submit to his condition. A good man is happy though he be afflicted, for he has not lost his enjoyment of God, nor his title to heaven; nay, he is happy because he is afflicted. Correction mortifies his corruptions, weans his heart from the world, draws him nearer to God, brings him to his Bible, brings him to his knees. Though God wounds, yet he supports his people under afflictions, and in due time delivers them. Making a wound is sometimes part of a cure. Eliphaz gives Job precious promises of what God would do for him, if he humbled himself. Whatever troubles good men may be in, they shall do them no real harm. Being kept from sin, they are kept from the evil of trouble. And if the servants of Christ are not delivered from outward troubles, they are delivered by them, and while overcome by one trouble, they conquer all. Whatever is maliciously said against them shall not hurt them. They shall have wisdom and grace to manage their concerns. The greatest blessing, both in our employments and in our enjoyments, is to be kept from sin. They shall finish their course with joy and honour. That man lives long enough who has done his work, and is fit for another world. It is a mercy to die seasonably, as the corn is cut and housed when fully ripe; not till then, but then not suffered to stand any longer. Our times are in God's hands; it is well they are so. Believers are not to expect great wealth, long life, or to be free from trials. But all will be ordered for the best. And remark from Job's history, that steadiness of mind and heart under trial, is one of the highest attainments of faith. There is little exercise for faith when all things go well. But if God raises a storm, permits the enemy to send wave after wave, and seemingly stands aloof from our prayers, then, still to hang on and trust God, when we cannot trace him, this is the patience of the saints. Blessed Saviour! how sweet it is to look unto thee, the Author and Finisher of faith, in such moments!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great - Margin, "much."

Little by little Eliphaz passes from a general description of the blessedness of those faithful ones who "despise not the chastening of the Almighty" (ver. 17) to a series of allusions which seem specially to touch Job's case. Without claiming prophetical inspiration, he ventures to promise him in the future "the exact reverse of all that he had experienced" in the past - "a safe home, flocks untouched, a happy and prosperous family, a peaceful old age" (Cook). The promises may have sounded in Job's ears as "a mockery" (ibid.); but it is creditable to the sagacity of Eliphaz that he ventured to make them. And thine offspring as the grass of the earth. The ordinary symbols for multitudinous-ness - the sand of the sea, and the stars of heaven - are here superseded by an entirely new one, "the grass of the earth." Undoubtedly it is equally appropriate, and perhaps more natural in a pastoral community. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>17  Behold, happy is the man whom Eloah correcteth;<p>So despise not the chastening of the Almighty!<p>18  For He woundeth, and He also bindeth up;<p>He bruiseth, and His hands make whole.<p>19  In six troubles He will rescue thee,<p>And in seven no evil shall touch thee.<p>20  In famine He will redeem thee from death,<p>And in war from the stroke of the sword.<p>21  When the tongue scourgeth, thou shalt be hidden;<p>And thou shalt not fear destruction when it cometh.<p>The speech of Eliphaz now becomes persuasive as it turns towards the conclusion. Since God humbles him who exalts himself, and since He humbles in order to exalt, it is a happy thing when He corrects (&#1492;&#1493;&#1499;&#1497;&#1495;) us by afflictive dispensations; and His chastisement (&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1512;) is to be received not with a turbulent spirit, but resignedly, yea joyously: the same thought as <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/3-11.htm">Proverbs 3:11-13</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/94-12.htm">Psalm 94:12</a>, in both passages borrowed from this; whereas <a href="/job/5-18.htm">Job 5:18</a> here, like <a href="/hosea/6-1.htm">Hosea 6:1</a>; <a href="/lamentations/3-31.htm">Lamentations 3:31</a>., refers to <a href="/deuteronomy/32-39.htm">Deuteronomy 32:39</a>. &#1512;&#1508;&#1488;, to heal, is here conjugated like a &#1492;&#1500; verb (Ges. 75, rem. 21). <a href="/job/5-19.htm">Job 5:19</a> is formed after the manner of the so-called number-proverbs (<a href="/proverbs/6-16.htm">Proverbs 6:16</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/30-15.htm">Proverbs 30:15</a>, <a href="/proverbs/30-18.htm">Proverbs 30:18</a>), as also the roll of the judgment of the nations in <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/1.htm">Amos 1-2</a>: in six troubles, yea in still more than six. &#1512;&#1506; is the extremity that is perhaps to be feared. In <a href="//biblehub.com/job/5-20.htm">Job 5:20</a>, the praet. is a kind of prophetic praet. The scourge of the tongue recalls the similar promise, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/31-21.htm">Psalm 31:21</a>, where, instead of scourge, it is: the disputes of the tongue. &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1491;, from &#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1491; violence, disaster, is allied in sound with &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1496;. Isaiah has this passage of the book of Job in his memory when he writes <a href="/job/28-15.htm">Job 28:15</a>. The promises of Eliphaz now continue to rise higher, and sound more delightful and more glorious. </body></html>
