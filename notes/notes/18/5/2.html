But the meaning seems rather to be, as Bishop Patrick observes, that “God in his anger and indignation destroys the wicked, and such as err from his precepts.” It is probable that Eliphaz intended to distinguish Job by the characters of <span class="ital">foolish and silly one, </span>to insinuate that all his misfortunes were owing to his folly and weakness, or to his sins and vices. By the <span class="ital">foolish </span>is meant the <span class="ital">rash </span>and <span class="ital">inconsiderate </span>man, who does not weigh things impartially; and by the <span class="ital">silly one, </span>the man who, for want of true wisdom, is soon deceived with false opinions, and with appearances of present things.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/job/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:1-5 Eliphaz here calls upon Job to answer his arguments. Were any of the saints or servants of God visited with such Divine judgments as Job, or did they ever behave like him under their sufferings? The term, saints, holy, or more strictly, consecrated ones, seems in all ages to have been applied to the people of God, through the Sacrifice slain in the covenant of their reconciliation. Eliphaz doubts not that the sin of sinners directly tends to their ruin. They kill themselves by some lust or other; therefore, no doubt, Job has done some foolish thing, by which he has brought himself into this condition. The allusion was plain to Job's former prosperity; but there was no evidence of Job's wickedness, and the application to him was unfair and severe.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For wrath killeth the foolish man - That is, the wrath of God. The word foolish here is used as synonymous with wicked, because wickedness is supreme folly. The general proposition here is, that the wicked are cut off, and that they are overtaken with heavy calamities in this life. In proof of this, Eliphaz appeals in the following verses to his own observation: The implied inference is, that Job, having had all his possessions taken away, and having been overwhelmed with unspeakably great personal calamities, was to be regarded as having been a great sinner. Some suppose, however, that the word "wrath" here relates to the indignation or the repining of the individual himself, and that the reference is to the fact that such wrath or repining preys upon the spirit, and draws down the divine vengeance. This is the view of Schultens, and of Noyes. But it seems more probable that Eliphaz means to state the proposition, that the wrath of God burns against the wicked, and that the following verses are an illustration of this sentiment, derived from his own observation.<p>And envy - Margin, "indignation." Jerome, invidia, envy. Septuagint &#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  ze&#772;los. Castellio, severitas ac vehementia. The Hebrew word &#1511;&#1504;&#1488;&#1492;  q&#305;&#770;n'a&#770;h means jealousy, envy, ardor, zeal. It may be applied to any strong affection of the mind; any fervent, glowing, and burning emotion. Gesenius supposes it means here envy, as excited by the prosperity of others. To me it seems that the connection requires us to understand it of wrath, or indignation, as in <a href="/deuteronomy/29-20.htm">Deuteronomy 29:20</a>; <a href="/psalms/79-5.htm">Psalm 79:5</a>. As applied to God, it often means his jealousy, or his anger, when the affections of people are placed on other objects than himself; <a href="/numbers/25-11.htm">Numbers 25:11</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-18.htm">Zephaniah 1:18</a>, et al.<p>Slayeth the silly one - Good and Noyes render this, "the weak man." Jerome, parvulum, the little one. The Septuagint, &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  peplane&#772;menon, the erring. Walton, ardelionem, the busy-body. The Hebrew word &#1508;&#1514;&#1492;  poteh is from &#1508;&#1514;&#1492;  pa&#770;tha&#770;h, to open, go expand; and hence, the participleis applied to one who opens his lips, or whose mouth is open; that is, a garrulous person, <a href="/proverbs/20-19.htm">Proverbs 20:19</a>; and also to one who is open-hearted, frank, ingenuous, unsuspicious; and hence, one who is easily influenced by others, or whose heart may be easily enticed. Thus, it comes to mean one who is simple and foolish. In this sense it is used here, to denote one who is so simple and foolish as to be drawn aside by weak arguments and unfounded opinions. I have no doubt that Eliphaz meant, by insinuation, to apply this to Job, as being a weak-minded man, for having allowed the views which he entertained to make such an impression on his mind, and for having expressed himself as he had done. The proposition is general; but it would be easy to undertand how he intended it to be applied. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. wrath &#8230; envy&#8212;fretful and passionate complaints, such as Eliphaz charged Job with (Job 4:5; so Pr 14:30).

For those men, notwithstanding their present prosperity, are doomed to great and certain misery, as it here follows. And so this verse coheres with the following as well as the foregoing verses. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/job/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For wrath killeth the foolish man,.... Not one that is an idiot, and destitute of common sense, and has no understanding in things natural and civil; but a wicked man, who has no knowledge of things divine and spiritual, and so foolish; which is the character of every natural man, and of God's people before conversion; and even of some professors, who are foolish virgins, and carry the lamp of a religious profession without the oil of grace; and such an one Eliphaz took Job to be, whom sooner or later the wrath of the Lord, as the Targum interprets it, which is revealed from heaven, and comes down upon the children of disobedience, would consume like devouring fire: or this may be understood of the wrath and passion of such men themselves, which sometimes rises in them to such an height, as that they die in a fit of it; or do those things which bring them to death, either by the hand of God, or by the civil magistrate: <p>and envy slayeth the silly one; one that is simple and void of understanding, and is easily persuaded and drawn into sin, either by his own heart, or by evil men, or by the temptations of Satan; and in whose heart envy at the prosperity of others dwells, and which insensibly preys upon him, eats up his own spirits, and is rottenness to his bones, and crumbles them into dust, <a href="/proverbs/14-30.htm">Proverbs 14:30</a>; or the word may be rendered "jealousy", or "zeal" (q), as it sometimes is, and may signify the jealousy of the Lord, zeal for his own glory, which he sometimes stirs up as a man of war, and which smokes against wicked men, and consumes them as fire, see <a href="/isaiah/42-13.htm">Isaiah 42:13</a>; Eliphaz by all this would represent and insinuate that Job was such a man, hot, passionate, and angry with God and his providence, and envious at the prosperity of others, particularly his friends; and so was a foolish and silly man, in whose breast wrath and envy rested, and would be his ruin and destruction, as he was already under slaying and killing providences. <p>(q) "zelus", Vatablus, Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator, Schmidt, Michaelis, Schultens. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> wrath killeth the foolish man, and envy slayeth the silly one.</span><p>(b) Murmuring against God in afflictions increases the pain, and uttered man's folly.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/job/5.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2</span>. <a href="/job/5-1.htm" title="Call now, if there be any that will answer you; and to which of the saints will you turn?">Job 5:1</a> asked, Will any one answer thy complaint? will complaining bring any deliverance? This verse gives the other side—nay, rather, such murmuring betrays a mind “most incorrect to heaven,” and such a fool will by his impatience but bring upon himself increased calamity till he altogether perish.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Nay, rather, the foolish man impatience killeth,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And the silly one his passion slayeth.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The meaning, of course, is not that the fool and silly one vex themselves to death, but that their rebellious impatience and resentment of the chastisements of heaven bring down upon them more grievous chastisement, under which they perish. There are several words for “fool” in the Old Testament. Two characteristics of the fool here spoken of are mentioned: he rejects instruction or correction, <a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm" title="The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction.">Proverbs 1:7</a>; <a href="/proverbs/12-15.htm" title="The way of a fool is right in his own eyes: but he that listens to counsel is wise.">Proverbs 12:15</a>; and he openly exhibits his chagrin or angry impatience, <a href="/proverbs/12-16.htm" title="A fool's wrath is presently known: but a prudent man covers shame.">Proverbs 12:16</a> (<span class="ital">ka‘as</span> as here). The last word describes impatient bearing under affliction, or under that which offends, such as an affront. These words of Eliphaz hurt Job deeply, and in the very first sentence of his reply he alludes to them, “Oh that my impatience (<span class="ital">ka‘as</span>) were weighed and laid in the balances against my affliction,” ch. <a href="/job/6-2.htm" title="Oh that my grief were thoroughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances together!">Job 6:2</a>. The word in the second half of the verse means properly <span class="ital">heat</span>, hence any strong passion, as jealousy, the wild ardour of battle, <a href="/isaiah/42-13.htm" title="The LORD shall go forth as a mighty man, he shall stir up jealousy like a man of war: he shall cry, yes, roar; he shall prevail against his enemies.">Isaiah 42:13</a>, and the like. On the use of “fool” and similar words in a moral sense to denote wicked, that is, without true insight into the ways of God and right feeling towards Heaven, see on ch. <a href="/job/2-10.htm" title="But he said to her, You speak as one of the foolish women speaks. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips.">Job 2:10</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For wrath killeth the foolish man, and envy slayeth the silly one</span>. For "wrath" and "envy "others suggest "vexaation" and "impatience" (Lee), or "vexation" and "jealousy" (Revised Version). The connection of thought seems to be, "For thou art quite foolish enough to let thy vexation and impatience prompt thee to such a course, which could only lead to thy destruction." Eliphaz is quite sure that trust in any other beside God, and appeal to any other against God, is utter folly, sinful infatuation, and must lead to the ruin of whoever indulges in it. Thus the invocation of angels receives no countenance from him, but the contrary. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>17  Is a mortal just before Eloah,<p>Or a man pure before his Maker?<p>18  Behold, He trusteth not His servants!<p>And His angels He chargeth with imperfection.<p>19  How much more those who dwell in houses of clay,<p>They are crushed as though they were moths.<p>20  From morning until evening, - so are they broken in pieces:<p>Unobserved they perish for ever.<p>21  Is it not so: the cord of their tent in them is torn away,<p>So they die, and not in wisdom?<p>The question arises whether &#1502;&#1503; is comparative: prae Deo, on which Mercier with penetration remarks: justior sit oportet qui immerito affligitur quam qui immerito affligit; or causal: a Deo, h.e., ita ut a Deo justificetur. All modern expositors rightly decide on the latter. Hahn justly maintains that &#1506;&#1501; and &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497; are found in a similar connection in other places; and <a href="/job/32-2.htm">Job 32:2</a> is perhaps not to be explained in any other way, at least that does not restrict the present passage. By the servants of God, none but the angels, mentioned in the following line of the verse, are intended. &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1501; with &#1489;&#1468; signifies imputare (<a href="/1_samuel/22-15.htm">1 Samuel 22:15</a>); in <a href="/job/24-12.htm">Job 24:12</a> (comp. <a href="/job/1-22.htm">Job 1:22</a>) we read &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1500;&#1492;, absurditatem (which Hupf. wishes to restore even here), joined with the verb in this signification. The form &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1500;&#1492; is certainly not to be taken as stultitia from the verb &#1492;&#1500;&#1500;; the half vowel, and still less the absence of the Dagesh, will not allow this. &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1503; (Olsh. 213, c), itself uncertain in its etymology, presents no available analogy. The form points to a Lamedh-He verb, as &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1502;&#1492; from &#1512;&#1502;&#1492;, so perhaps from &#1492;&#1500;&#1492;, Niph. &#1504;&#1492;&#1500;&#1488;, remotus, <a href="/micah/4-7.htm">Micah 4:7</a> : being distant, being behind the perfect, difference; or even from &#1492;&#1500;&#1492; (Targ. &#1492;&#1500;&#1488;, Pa. &#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;)  equals  &#1500;&#1488;&#1492;, weakness, want of strength.<p>(Note: Schnurrer compares the Arabic wahila, which signifies to be relaxed, forgetful, to err, to neglect. Ewald, considering the &#1514; as radical, compares the Arabic dll, to err, and ta&#770;l, med. wau, to be dizzy, unconscious; but neither from &#1493;&#1492;&#1500; nor from &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1500; can the substantival form be sustained.)<p>Both significations will do, for it is not meant that the good spirits positively sin, as if sin were a natural necessary consequence of their creatureship and finite existence, but that even the holiness of the good spirits is never equal to the absolute holiness of God, and that this deficiency is still greater in spirit-corporeal man, who has earthiness as the basis of his original nature. At the same time, it is presupposed that the distance between God and created earth is disproportionately greater than between God and created spirit, since matter is destined to be exalted to the nature of the spirit, but also brings the spirit into the danger of being degraded to its own level.</body></html>
