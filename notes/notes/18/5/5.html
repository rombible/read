The word <span class="greekheb">שׂא</span>Š<span class="ital">shaaph, </span>rendered <span class="ital">swalloweth up, </span>literally means to <span class="ital">draw in the air, </span>to <span class="ital">pant after, </span>to <span class="ital">swallow greedily; </span>and is applied to wild beasts, snuffing up the wind in pursuit of their prey. The sense of the clause is, that these robbers shall hasten with great eagerness, shall greedily pant after and swallow up their entire substance, so as to leave them in the most deplorable condition.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/job/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:1-5 Eliphaz here calls upon Job to answer his arguments. Were any of the saints or servants of God visited with such Divine judgments as Job, or did they ever behave like him under their sufferings? The term, saints, holy, or more strictly, consecrated ones, seems in all ages to have been applied to the people of God, through the Sacrifice slain in the covenant of their reconciliation. Eliphaz doubts not that the sin of sinners directly tends to their ruin. They kill themselves by some lust or other; therefore, no doubt, Job has done some foolish thing, by which he has brought himself into this condition. The allusion was plain to Job's former prosperity; but there was no evidence of Job's wickedness, and the application to him was unfair and severe.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Whose harvest the hungry eateth up - That is, they are not permitted to enjoy the avails of their own labor. The harvest field is subject to the depredations of others, who contrive to possess themselves of it, and to consume it.<p>And taketh it even out of the thorns - Or, he seizes it to the very thorns. That is, the famished robber seizes the whole of the harvest. He takes it all away, even to the thistles, and chaff, and cockle, and whatever impure substances there may be growing with the grain. He does not wait to separate the grain from the other substances, but consumes it all. He spares nothing.<p>And the robber swalloweth up their substance - Noyes renders this, as Gesenius proposes to do, "and a snare gapeth after his substance;" Dr. Good, "and rigidly swoopeth up their substance." Rosenmuller much better:<p>Cujusquo facultates oxhauriebant sitibundi, copying exactly the version of Castellio. The Vulgate in a similar manner, Et bibent sitientes divitias ejus - And the thirsty drink up his wealth. The Septuagint, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b7; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c2;  eksifo&#772;nisthein auto&#772;n he&#772; ischus - "should their power be absorbed." The true sense, as I conceive, is, "the thirsty gasp, or pant, after their wealth;" that is, they consume it. The word rendered in our common version "the robber &#1510;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;  tsamm&#305;&#770;ym is, according to the ancient versions, the same as &#1510;&#1502;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501;  tsa&#770;me&#770;'&#305;&#770;ym, the thirsty, and this sense the parallelism certainly requires. So obvious is this, that it is better to suppose a slight error in the Hebrew text, than to give it the signification of a snare," as Noyes does, and as Gesenius (Lexicon) proposes. The word rendered "swalloweth up" (&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1507;  sha&#770;'aph) means, properly, to breathe hard, to pant, to blow; and then to yawn after, to desire, to absorb; and the sense here is, that the thirsty consume their property. The whole figure is taken from robbers and freebooters; and I have no doubt that Eliphaz meant impliedly to allude to the ease of Job, and to say that he had known just such cases, where, though there was great temporary prosperity, yet before long the children of the man who was prospered, and who professed to be pious, but was not, were crushed, and his property taken away by robbers. It was this similarity of the case of Job to the facts which he had observed, that staggered him so much in regard to his cbaracter. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. even out of the thorns&#8212;Even when part of the grain remains hanging on the thorn bushes (or, "is growing among thorns," Mt 13:7), the hungry gleaner does not grudge the trouble of even taking it away, so clean swept away is the harvest of the wicked.<p>the robber&#8212;as the Sabeans, who robbed Job.

This is to be understood of the foolish rich man before described, as taking root and flourishing; though he sows, and reaps and gathers in his harvest, and fancies he has goods laid up for many years, to be enjoyed by him, yet he is taken away by death, and another eats what he has gathered; either his hungry heirs, that he has kept bare, and without the proper necessaries of life; or the poor whom he has oppressed, who, driven by hunger, seize upon his harvest, and eat it up, whether he be alive or dead: Sephorno interprets this of the wicked man himself, who should eat up his own harvest, and not have enough to satisfy him, the curse of God being upon his land; and another learned interpreter (s) thinks the sense is, that such should be the curse of God on the fields of wicked men, that they should produce no more than what was usually left to the poor, and therefore should have no need to gather it: <p>and taketh it even out of the thorns; that is, either the hungry man takes the harvest out of the thorns, among which it grows, see <a href="/matthew/13-7.htm">Matthew 13:7</a>; or which he had gotten "through the thorns", as Mr. Broughton renders it; that is, the owner, through many difficulties; and hunger will break through many to get at it; or though his harvest being got in, is enclosed with a thorn hedge, the hungry man gets through it, and takes it out from it, surrounded by it; the above mentioned Jewish writer understands this also of the wicked man, who takes his own harvest out from among the thorns, so that there is nothing left for the poor and his friends, as it is meet there should: the word (t) for "thorns" has also the signification of armour, particularly of shields; hence the Targum is,"and armed men with warlike arms shall take it away;''to which agrees the Vulgate Latin version,"and the armed men shall take it away;''that is, soldiers should forage, spoil, and destroy it: <p>and the robber swalloweth up their substance; the house robber, who breaks in and devours all at once, and makes a clear riddance of it; some render it "the hairy man" (u) either that neglects his hair, as beggars, or such that live in desert places, as robbers, that they may appear the more terrible; or that take care of it, and nourish it, and tie it up in locks, and behind their heads, as Bar Tzemach and Ben Melech observe they do in Turkey; others translate it "the thirsty" (w), and so it answers to the hungry in the preceding clause, and designs such who thirst, and gape after, and covet the substance of others, and greedily catch at it, and swallow it up at once, at one draught, as a thirsty man does a large quantity of liquor, see <a href="/proverbs/1-12.htm">Proverbs 1:12</a>; this may have some respect to the Sabeans and Chaldeans, that swallowed up Job's substance, and took away his cattle from him at once, and were no other than bands of robbers; and the use of the word for a thief or a robber, as we take it, is confirmed by a learned man (x), who derives it from the Arabic word which signifies to smite with a club or stone. <p>(s) Schmidt.

The explanation which follows - those whose &#1497;&#1505;&#1493;&#1491;, i.e., foundation of existence, is in dust - shows still more clearly that the poet has <a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/3-19.htm">Genesis 3:19</a>, in his mind.

They last only from morning until evening: they are broken in pieces (&#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1514;, from &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1514;, for &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1514;); they are therefore as ephemerae.

Olshausen is inclined to read &#1497;&#1514;&#1491;&#1501;, their tent-pole, instead of &#1497;&#1514;&#1512;&#1501;, and at any rate thinks the accompanying &#1489;&#1468;&#1501; superfluous and awkward. But (1) the comparison used here of the soul, and of the life sustained by it, corresponds to its comparison elsewhere with a thread or weft, of which death is the cutting through or loosing (<a href="/job/6-9.htm">Job 6:9</a>; <a href="/job/27-8.htm">Job 27:8</a>; <a href="/isaiah/38-12.htm">Isaiah 38:12</a>); (12) &#1489;&#1468;&#1501; is neither superfluous nor awkward, since it is intended to say, that their duration of life falls in all at once like a tent when that which in them (&#1489;&#1501;) corresponds to the cord of a tent (i.e., the &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;) is drawn away from it. The relation of the members of the sentence in <a href="/job/4-21.htm">Job 4:21</a> is just the same as in <a href="/job/4-2.htm">Job 4:2</a> : Will they not die when it is torn away, etc. They then die off in lack of wisdom, i.e., without having acted in accordance with the perishableness of their nature and their distance from God; therefore, rightly considered: unprepared and suddenly, comp. <a href="/job/36-12.htm">Job 36:12</a>; <a href="/proverbs/5-23.htm">Proverbs 5:23</a>.
