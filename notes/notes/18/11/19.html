He thought that worldly prosperity was always the lot of the righteous, and that Job was to be deemed a hypocrite unless his prosperity was restored. Then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; that is, thou mayst come boldly to the throne of grace, and not with the terror and amazement expressed in ch. 9:34. If we are looked upon in the face of the Anointed, our faces that were cast down may be lifted up; though polluted, being now washed with the blood of Christ, they may be lifted up without spot. We may draw near in full assurance of faith, when we are sprinkled from an evil conscience, Heb 10:22.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Many shall make suit unto thee - Many shall come in a suppliant manner to ask counsel and advice.

To spread out the hands in prayer is &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; (&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1474;) &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1474;; &#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; is seldom used instead of the more artistic &#1499;&#1508;&#1497;&#1501;, palmas, h.e. manus supinas. The conditional antecedent clause is immediately followed, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/11-14.htm">Job 11:14</a>, by a similarly conditional parenthetical clause, which inserts the indispensable condition of acceptable prayer; the conclusion might begin with &#1492;&#1512;&#1492;&#1497;&#1511;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;: when thou sendest forth thy heart and spreadest out thy hands to Him, if there is wickedness in thy hand, put it far away; but the antecedent requires a promise for its conclusion, and the more so since the praet. and fut. which follow &#1488;&#1501;, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/11-13.htm">Job 11:13</a>, have the force of futt. exact.: si disposueris et extenderis, to which the conclusion: put it far away, is not suited, which rather expresses a preliminary condition of acceptable prayer. The conclusion then begins with &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1470;&#1488;&#1494;, then indeed, like <a href="/job/8-6.htm">Job 8:6</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/13-19.htm">Job 13:19</a>, comp. <a href="//biblehub.com/job/6-3.htm">Job 6:3</a>, with &#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, now indeed; the causal signification of &#1499;&#1497; has in both instances passed into the confirmatory (comp. <a href="/1_samuel/14-44.htm">1 Samuel 14:44</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/118-10.htm">Psalm 118:10-12</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/128-2.htm">Psalm 128:2</a>, and on <a href="/genesis/26-22.htm">Genesis 26:22</a>): then verily wilt thou be able to raise thy countenance (without being forced to make any more bitter complaints, as <a href="/job/10-15.htm">Job 10:15</a>.), without spot, i.e., not: without bodily infirmity, but: without spot of punishable guilt, sceleris et paenae (Rosenmller). &#1502;&#1503; here signifies without (Targ. &#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;), properly: far from, as <a href="/job/21-9.htm">Job 21:9</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/1-22.htm">2 Samuel 1:22</a>; <a href="/proverbs/20-3.htm">Proverbs 20:3</a>.
