He represented him as a man that loved to hear himself speak, though he could say nothing to the purpose, and as a man that maintained falsehoods. He desired God would show Job that less punishment was exacted than he deserved. We are ready, with much assurance, to call God to act in our quarrels, and to think that if he would but speak, he would take our part. We ought to leave all disputes to the judgment of God, which we are sure is according to truth; but those are not always right who are most forward to appeal to the Divine judgment.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Should not the multitude of words be answered? - As if all that Job had said had been mere words; or as if he was remarkable for mere garrulity.<p>And should a man full of talk be justified - Margin, as in Hebrew "of lips." The phrase is evidently a Hebraism, to denote a great talker - a man of mere lips, or empty sound. Zophar asks whether such a man could be justified or vindicated. It will be recollected that taciturnity was with the Orientals a much greater virtue than with us, and that it was regarded as one of the proofs of wisdom. The wise man with them was he who sat down at the feet of age, and desired to learn; who carefully collected the maxims of former times; who diligently observed the course of events; and who deliberated with care on what others had to say. Thus, Solomon says, "In the multitude of words there wanteth not sin: but he that refraineth his lips is wise;" <a href="/proverbs/10-19.htm">Proverbs 10:19</a>; so <a href="//biblehub.com/james/1-19.htm">James 1:19</a>, "let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak." It was supposed that a man who said much would say some foolish or improper things, and hence, it was regarded as a proof of prudence to be distinguished for silence. In Oriental countries, and it may be added also, in all countries that we regard as uncivilized, it is unusual and disrespectful to be hasty in offering counsel, to be forward to speak, or to be confident and bold in opinion; see the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/job/32-6.htm">Job 32:6-7</a>. It was for reasons such as these that Zophar maintained that a man who was full of talk could not be justified in it; that there was presumptive proof that he was not a safe man, or a man who could be vindicated in all that he said. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. Zophar assails Job for his empty words, and indirectly, the two friends, for their weak reply. Taciturnity is highly prized among Orientals (Pr 10:8, 19).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/job/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Dost thou think to carry thy cause by thy long and tedious discourses, consisting of empty words, without weight or reason?

Zophar insinuates, that Job was a mere babbler, a talkative man, that had words, but no matter; said a great deal, but there was nothing in what he said; that his words were but wind, yea, in effect that he was a fool, who is commonly full of words, and is known by the multitude of them; and whereas he might think to bear down all before him in this way, and to discourage persons from giving him an answer; this Zophar suggests should not be the case, nor would he be deterred hereby from giving one, which he now undertook: some supply it, as Bar Tzemach, "should not a man of a multitude of words" (s), &amp;c. a verbose man, a dealer in many words, and nothing else, should not he be "answered?" if he uses nothing but words, and there is no argument in them, they seem not to deserve an answer, unless it be to show the emptiness of them, expose a man's folly, and pull down his pride and vanity: <p>and should a man full of talk be justified? or "a man of lips" (t), an eloquent man, or one that affects to be so; a man of a fine speech, who artfully colours things, and makes a show of wisdom and truth, when there are neither in what he says; is such a man to be justified? he would seem to be in his own eyes at least, if not in the eyes of others, if not answered; he would be thought to have carried his point, to have had the better of the argument, and to have got the victory by dint of words and power of oratory; for this is not to be understood of justification before God; for as no man is heard and accepted by him for his "much speaking", as was the opinion of the Heathens, so neither are any justified on account of their many words, any more than their many works; since, in a multitude of words there are often not only much folly and weakness, but vanities and sins, <a href="/proverbs/10-19.htm">Proverbs 10:19</a>; there is indeed a sense in which a man is justified by his words, <a href="/matthew/12-37.htm">Matthew 12:37</a>; when he confesses Christ, and professes to be justified by his righteousness, and believes in that, and pleads it as his justifying righteousness; he is justified by that righteousness; which is contained in the confession and profession of his faith; but this is not here meant. <p>(s)  "an abundans verbis", Beza; "an multus verbis", Mercerus, so Kimchi &amp; Ben Melech; and most Hebrew writers take for an adjective.

A pause was allowed to intervene, and the words with which he commences form his apology for speaking—he replies to Job only lest Job should fancy that by his much speaking he has shewn himself to be in the right, cf. <a href="/proverbs/10-19.htm" title="In the multitude of words there wants not sin: but he that refrains his lips is wise.">Proverbs 10:19</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">should a man full of talk</span>] Or, <span class="ital">shall</span> a man full of talk, lit. <span class="ital">a man of lips</span>.

Job had certainly been somewhat unduly verbose, and laid himself open to the taunt here launched against him; but neither had brevity been studied by his other friends in their previous answers (ch. 4, 5, and 8.), nor is it greatly studied by Zophar here. <span class="cmt_word">And should a man full of talk be justified?</span> literally, <span class="accented">a man of lips</span> which may mean either "a great talker" or "a man who makes many professions."

This detestation of his existence passes into the wish, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/10-20.htm">Job 10:20</a>, that God would be pleased at least somewhat to relieve him ere he is swallowed up by the night of Hades. We must neither with the Targ. translate: are not my days few, and vanishing away? nor with Oetinger: will not my fewness of days cease? Both are contrary to the correct accentuation. Olshausen thinks it remarkable that there is not a weaker pausal accent to &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;; but such a one is really indirectly there, for Munach is here equivalent to Dech, from which it is formed (vid., the rule in Comm. ber den Psalter, ii. 504). Accordingly, Seb. Schmid correctly translates: nonne parum dies mei? ideo cessa. The Keri substitutes the precative form of expression for the optative: cease then, turn away from me then (imper. consec. with waw of the result, Ewald, 235, a); comp. the precative conclusion to the speech, <a href="/job/7-16.htm">Job 7:16</a>., but there is no real reason for changing the optative form of the text. &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514; (voluntative for &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;, <a href="/job/9-33.htm">Job 9:33</a>) may be supplemented by &#1497;&#1491;&#1493;, &#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493;, &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493; ,&#1508;, or &#1500;&#1489;&#1493; (<a href="/job/7-17.htm">Job 7:17</a>) (not, however, with Hirz., &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1496;&#1493;, after <a href="//biblehub.com/job/9-34.htm">Job 9:34</a>, which is too far-fetched for the usage of the language, or with Bttch., &#1502;&#1495;&#1504;&#1492;&#1493;, copias suas); &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514; can however, like &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/4-20.htm">Job 4:20</a>, signify to turn one's self to, se disponere  equals  to attend to, consequently &#1502;&#1503; &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514;, to turn the attention from, as &#1502;&#1503; &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1492;, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/7-19.htm">Job 7:19</a>, <a href="/psalms/39-14.htm">Psalm 39:14</a> (where, as here, &#1493;&#1488;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497;&#1490;&#1492; follows).<p>continued...</body></html>
