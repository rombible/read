Literally, it runs, <span class= "ital">And hollow man is instructed, and the wild ass’s colt is born a man. </span>Whether it means that if God did not thus conceal His observation of human actions, the very fool and the most obstinate would become instructed and disciplined, whereas now they are allowed to go on in their folly and obstinacy; or whether it is meant that, notwithstanding the dealings of Providence, hollow-hearted man is still devoid of heart, and every son of Adam at his birth is a very wild ass colt; or whether, again, it is meant that by reason of the Divine discipline the hollow-hearted man is disciplined, and the very wild ass colt is born a man and humanised, it is hard to decide. The uncertainty in part arises from our not knowing the exact meaning of the first verb: whether it is to get understanding or to be deprived of it—for either is possible. Another way of taking the context is to refer the last clause of <a href="/job/11-11.htm" title="For he knows vain men: he sees wickedness also; will he not then consider it?">Job 11:11</a>, not to God, but to man. Man sees not that God sees him, for an empty man will get understanding when a wild ass’s colt is born a man—that is, the latter is as likely as the former. One point is pretty clear, that by the wild ass’s colt Zophar means Job. However, he suggests that if he will become something better and wiser, and will put away his secret sin, which he is convinced must cling to him, then he shall again know prosperity and be established in it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/job/11.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/job/11-12.htm" title="For vain men would be wise, though man be born like a wild ass's colt.">Job 11:12</a></span>. <span class="ital">For, </span>or, <span class="ital">yet, vain man would be wise — </span>Man, who since the fall is void of all true wisdom, pretends to be wise, and able to pass a censure upon all God’s ways and works. <span class="ital">Born like a wild ass’s colt — </span>Ignorant, and dull, and stupid, as to divine things, and yet heady and untractable.

See here what man is; and let him be humbled. God sees this concerning vain man, that he would be wise, would be thought so, though he is born like a wild ass's colt, so unteachable and untameable. Man is a vain creature; empty, so the word is. Yet he is a proud creature, and self-conceited. He would be wise, would be thought so, though he will not submit to the laws of wisdom. He would be wise, he reaches after forbidden wisdom, and, like his first parents, aiming to be wise above what is written, loses the tree of life for the tree of knowledge. Is such a creature as this fit to contend with God?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For vain man - Margin, "empty." &#1504;&#1489;&#1493;&#1489;  na&#770;bu&#770;b, according to Gesenius, from the root &#1504;&#1489;&#1489;  na&#770;bab, to bore through, and then to be hollow; metaphorical, "empty," "foolish." The Septuagint, strangely enough, renders this," but man floats about with words." The Hebrew here means, manifestly, hollow, empty; then insincere and hypocritical. Zophar refers to a hollow-hearted man, who, though he was in fact like a wild ass's colt, attempted to appear mild and gentle, and to have a heart. The meaning is, that man by nature has a spirit untamed and unsubdued, and that with this, he assumes the appearance of gentleness and tenderness, and attempts to appear as if he was worthy of love and affection. God, seeing this hollow-heartedness, treats him accordingly. The reference here is to men like Job, and Zophar undoubtedly meant to say that he was hollow-hearted and insincere, and yet that he wished to appear to be a man having a heart, or, having true piety.<p>Would be wise - Various interpretations have been given to this expression. The most simple and obvious seems to be the true one, though I have not seen it noticed by any of the commentators. The word rendered "would be wise" (&#1497;&#1500;&#1489;&#1489;  y&#305;&#770;la&#770;be&#772;b) is from &#1500;&#1489;&#1489;  la&#770;bab, or &#1500;&#1489;  le&#770;b, meaning "heart," and the sense here, as it seems to me, is, "vain, hollow, and insincere, man would wish to seem to have a heart;" that is, would desire to appear sincere, or pious. Destitute of that truly, and false and hollow, he would nevertheless wish to appear different, and would put on the aspect of sincerity and religion. This is the most simple exposition, and this accords with the drift of the passage exactly, and expresses a sentiment which is unquestionably true. Gesenius, however, and some others render it, "but man is hollow and wanteth understanding; yea, man is born like a wild ass's colt, signifying the weakness and dullness of the human understanding in comparison with the divine wisdom." Others render it, "but the foolish man becometh wise when the wild ass's colt shall become a man," that is, never, a most forced and unnatural construction. Dr. Good renders it:<p>Will he then accept the hollow-hearted person?<p>Or shall the wild ass-colt assume the man?<p>Schultens and Dathe translate it:<p>Let then vain man be wise,<p>And the wild ass's colt become a man.<p>Though man be born - Though man by nature, or in connection with his birth, is untamed, lawless, rebellious. The wild ass is a striking image of that which is untamed and unsubdued; compare the notes at <a href="/job/39-5.htm">Job 39:5</a>. Thus, Jeremiah describes it, "a wild ass used to the wilderness, that snuffeth up the wind at her pleasure," <a href="/jeremiah/2-24.htm">Jeremiah 2:24</a>. Thus, it is said of Ishmael <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/16-12.htm">Genesis 16:12</a>, "and he will be a wild man," &#1488;&#1491;&#1501;  &#1508;&#1512;&#1488;  pa&#770;ra&#770;' 'a&#770;da&#770;m - a wild ass of a man. So <a href="/job/39-5.htm">Job 39:5</a> :<p>Who hath sent out the wild ass free?<p>Or who hath loosed the bands of the wild ass?<p>It is not quite easy for us to understand these allusions, for with us the ass is the proverbial image of stupidity, dullness, obstinacy, and immobility. But it was not so with the ancients. It is mentioned as distinguished for velocity, for wildness, and for an unsubdued spirit. Thus, Oppian, as quoted by Bochart, Hieroz. Lib. i. c. ix. p. 63, says:<p>&#x39a;&#x3c1;&#787;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd;, &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;, &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;.<p>Kraipnon, aellopode&#772;n, kratero&#772;nuchon, ocutaton thein.<p>"Swift, rapid, with strong hoofs, and most fleet in his course."<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. vain&#8212;hollow.<p>would be&#8212;"wants to consider himself wise"; opposed to God's "wisdom" (see on [498]Job 11:11); refuses to see sin, where God sees it (Ro 1:22).<p>wild ass's colt&#8212;a proverb for untamed wildness (Job 39:5, 8; Jer 2:24; Ge 16:12; Hebrew, "a wild-ass man").

Having finished his brilliant picture of God’s omniscient wisdom, Zophar adds further brilliancy to it by contrasting it with the brutishness of man. The verse perhaps should read,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But an empty man will become wise<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>When a wild ass colt is born a man,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>the one thing will happen when the other happens. The verse seems to be in the shape of a proverb, and is full of alliterations which cannot be reproduced in translation. The word “empty” is properly “hollow;” and “to become wise” is literally “to get heart,” i. e. understanding or mind (ch. <a href="/job/9-4.htm" title="He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who has hardened himself against him, and has prospered?">Job 9:4</a>, <a href="/job/12-3.htm" title="But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you: yes, who knows not such things as these?">Job 12:3</a>). The last phrase was understood by Gesenius to mean “to be without heart” or understanding. Following this view, many translate: But empty man is void of understanding, yea, man is born (like) a wild ass colt. Gesenius objects to the other that it offends against dignity. The verse has been interpreted in a great variety of ways.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> <span class="cmt_word">- For vain man would be wise, though man be born like a wild ass's colt</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and a vain man may get understanding</span>, <span class="accented">and the colt of a wild ass become a than</span> (compare the Revised Version, marginal rendering).

Instead of saying: then thou wouldst perceive, Zophar, realizing in his mind that which he has just wished, says imperiously &#1493;&#1491;&#1506; (an imper. consec., or, as Ewald, 345, b, calls it, imper. futuri, similar to <a href="/genesis/20-7.htm">Genesis 20:7</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/21-3.htm">2 Samuel 21:3</a>): thou must then perceive that God has dealt far more leniently with thee than thou hast deserved.
