Zophar, therefore, who professes superior wisdom, desires that God would show Job how far short he falls of it: that He would show him the hidden things, the secrets of wisdom; for sound wisdom is manifold: it has many aspects, and lies as it were fold over fold in unexpected complexities, defying the shallow and unscrutinising gaze; and were He to do this, Job would find out to his dismay that God still credited him part of the penalty due to him.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/job/11.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/job/11-4.htm" title="For you have said, My doctrine is pure, and I am clean in your eyes.">Job 11:4</a></span>. <span class="ital">Thou hast said, My doctrine — </span>Concerning God and his providence; <span class="ital">is pure — </span>That is, true and certain.

He represented him as a man that loved to hear himself speak, though he could say nothing to the purpose, and as a man that maintained falsehoods. He desired God would show Job that less punishment was exacted than he deserved. We are ready, with much assurance, to call God to act in our quarrels, and to think that if he would but speak, he would take our part. We ought to leave all disputes to the judgment of God, which we are sure is according to truth; but those are not always right who are most forward to appeal to the Divine judgment.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>My doctrine is pure - The Septuagint instead of the word "doctrine" here reads "deeds," &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;  ergois; the Syriac, "thou sayest I have acted justly." But the word used here (&#1500;&#1511;&#1495;  leqach) means properly "fair speech" or "taking arguments," that by which one is "taken" or captivated, from &#1500;&#1511;&#1495;  la&#770;qach, "to take."

This was a false charge.

The words are those of Job addressed to God, which Zophar recalls, cf. ch. <a href="/job/9-21.htm" title="Though I were perfect, yet would I not know my soul: I would despise my life.">Job 9:21</a>, <a href="/job/10-7.htm" title="You know that I am not wicked; and there is none that can deliver out of your hand.">Job 10:7</a>. It is probable that this clause explains what Zophar means by the preceding clause, “my doctrine is pure.” Job’s “doctrine,” which Zophar considers an example of “mockery,” is not his general principles, but this particular point, that God afflicts a man whom He <span class="ital">knows</span> to be righteous. Zophar quite justly discovers here a novel doctrine to which he certainly had not been accustomed. But connected with this particular assertion of Job’s were his views on human destiny in general, ch. <a href="/job/7-1.htm" title="Is there not an appointed time to man on earth? are not his days also like the days of an hireling?">Job 7:1</a>, and on the character of God’s government, ch. <a href="/context/job/9-1.htm" title="Then Job answered and said,...">Job 9:1-23</a>. The two preceding speakers had assumed that Job’s principles were identical with their own, and anticipated that a few good advices in the line of these principles would bring the man to a right mind. Zophar begins to surmise that they have a more obstinate disease to cure than they had looked for, and that Job’s principles, instead of being identical with theirs, cut clean athwart them. This discovery accounts for the rather unworthy tone of his language. His irritation was natural. He had never met a man with such ideas as those of Job before, and he is driven out of patience and decorum by his new theories. Elihu is even more shocked, and thinks that such another as Job does not exist, ch. <a href="/job/34-6.htm" title="Should I lie against my right? my wound is incurable without transgression.">Job 34:6</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For thou hast said, My doctrine is pure</span>. Job had certainly not said this in so many words. In fact, he had not spoken of his "doctrine" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5e7;&#x5d7;</span>), nor had he called either his doctrine or his conduct absolutely pure (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;</span>). But, no doubt, he had maintained, in a certain sense, his innocency; not, indeed, his entire freedom from sin or guilt, but his honest endeavour to serve God and lead a good life. This was the real point disputed between him and his "comforters;" they argued, from his sufferings, that he must be a "chief sinner;" he maintained, from the testimony of his conscience, that he was free from all heinous sins<span class="cmt_word">.

This detestation of his existence passes into the wish, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/10-20.htm">Job 10:20</a>, that God would be pleased at least somewhat to relieve him ere he is swallowed up by the night of Hades. We must neither with the Targ. translate: are not my days few, and vanishing away? nor with Oetinger: will not my fewness of days cease? Both are contrary to the correct accentuation. Olshausen thinks it remarkable that there is not a weaker pausal accent to &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;; but such a one is really indirectly there, for Munach is here equivalent to Dech, from which it is formed (vid., the rule in Comm. ber den Psalter, ii. 504). Accordingly, Seb. Schmid correctly translates: nonne parum dies mei? ideo cessa. The Keri substitutes the precative form of expression for the optative: cease then, turn away from me then (imper. consec. with waw of the result, Ewald, 235, a); comp. the precative conclusion to the speech, <a href="/job/7-16.htm">Job 7:16</a>., but there is no real reason for changing the optative form of the text. &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514; (voluntative for &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;, <a href="/job/9-33.htm">Job 9:33</a>) may be supplemented by &#1497;&#1491;&#1493;, &#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493;, &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493; ,&#1508;, or &#1500;&#1489;&#1493; (<a href="/job/7-17.htm">Job 7:17</a>) (not, however, with Hirz., &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1496;&#1493;, after <a href="//biblehub.com/job/9-34.htm">Job 9:34</a>, which is too far-fetched for the usage of the language, or with Bttch., &#1502;&#1495;&#1504;&#1492;&#1493;, copias suas); &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514; can however, like &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/4-20.htm">Job 4:20</a>, signify to turn one's self to, se disponere  equals  to attend to, consequently &#1502;&#1503; &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514;, to turn the attention from, as &#1502;&#1503; &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1492;, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/7-19.htm">Job 7:19</a>, <a href="/psalms/39-14.htm">Psalm 39:14</a> (where, as here, &#1493;&#1488;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497;&#1490;&#1492; follows).<p>continued...</body></html>
