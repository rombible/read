See here what man is; and let him be humbled. God sees this concerning vain man, that he would be wise, would be thought so, though he is born like a wild ass's colt, so unteachable and untameable. Man is a vain creature; empty, so the word is. Yet he is a proud creature, and self-conceited. He would be wise, would be thought so, though he will not submit to the laws of wisdom. He would be wise, he reaches after forbidden wisdom, and, like his first parents, aiming to be wise above what is written, loses the tree of life for the tree of knowledge. Is such a creature as this fit to contend with God?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For he knoweth vain men - He is intimately acquainted with the heart; he knows human beings altogether. The word "vain" here (&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1488;  sha&#770;v'), means properly vanity, emptiness, falsehood, a lie, iniquity. "Men of vanity," here may mean people whose opinions are valueless, or it may mean people of deceit, falsehood, hypocrisy. Most probably it means the latter, and the indirect reference may be to such men as Job. The sense is, that God is intimately acquainted with such men. They cannot deceive him, and their wickedness will be found out.<p>Will he not then consider it? - Various ways have been proposed of explaining this. By some it is supposed to mean, "He seeth iniquity, where they do not observe it;" that is, he perceives it, where people do not themselves. This would express a thought which would accord well with the connection, but it is doubtful whether the Hebrew will bear this construction. By another explanation it is supposed to mean, as in our common version, "Will not God observe it, and bring it to trial? Will he suffer it to pass unnoticed?" This makes good sense, and the Hebrew will admit of this interpretation. But there is another view still, which is preferable to either. According to this it means, that God perceives the iniquity in man, though he does not seem to notice it; see the notes at <a href="/job/11-6.htm">Job 11:6</a>. He appears to pass over a part of it, but he sees it notwithstanding, and is intimately acquainted with all the depravity of the heart. The main reference here is to Job, and the object is to show him that he was guilty, though he had asserted his innocence in so decided a manner. Though he seemed to himself to be innocent, yet Zophar labors to show him that he must be guilty, and that he had seen but a small part of his sins. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11.

Rather, from the connection, Job 11:6, "He seeth wickedness also, which man does not perceive"; literally, "But no (other, save He) perceiveth it" [Umbreit].

He knoweth that every man in the world is guilty of much vanity and folly, and therefore seeth sufficient reason for his severity against the best men, such as thou, O Job, fanciest thyself to be; and if thou wert so, thou hast no reason to wonder at or quarrel with his proceedings; and if thy quarrel be that he <span class="ital">shuts</span> thee <span class="ital">up</span>, or <span class="ital">cuts</span> thee <span class="ital">off</span>, when he <span class="ital">gathers others</span> under his wing and protection, whom thou thinkest or knowest to be worse than thyself, while thou dost impeach his justice, thou dost but betray thy own vanity and folly; for he knows both whom he chastiseth, and whom he spareth, and why he doth it, though he do not acquaint thee with the reasons of all his actions. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">He seeth wickedness also; </span> as he knoweth the vanity of all men, so he exactly perceiveth the wickedness of evil men, though it be covered with the veil of religion.

Job had used these words to describe God as an irresistible, unaccountable force; Zophar indicates what account is to be given of God’s actions—He knoweth vain (wicked, <a href="/psalms/26-4.htm" title="I have not sat with vain persons, neither will I go in with dissemblers.">Psalm 26:4</a>) men.

God is justified in these his judgments, even though he does not implead the man or bring him to account, or hear what he has got to say (Job 9:39), since he intuitively and at once "knoweth vain men;" sooth, that is, into the ground of the heart, and recognizes vanity, pretence, false seeming, so that he can judge infallibly without the forensic apparatus wherewith human tribunals are rightly surrounded, on account of the weakness and fallibility of human judges. He sooth wickedness also. If God can detect in a moment vanity,  pretence, false seeming, much more can he detect actual wickedness; which Zophar assumes to have been detected in Job's case<span class="cmt_word">. Will he not then consider it?</span> rather, <span class="accented">even though he consider it not</span> (see the Revised Version). God does not need to pause and ponder and "consider" each case.
