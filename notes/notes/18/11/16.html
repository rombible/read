He thought that worldly prosperity was always the lot of the righteous, and that Job was to be deemed a hypocrite unless his prosperity was restored. Then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; that is, thou mayst come boldly to the throne of grace, and not with the terror and amazement expressed in ch. 9:34. If we are looked upon in the face of the Anointed, our faces that were cast down may be lifted up; though polluted, being now washed with the blood of Christ, they may be lifted up without spot.

The comparison is beautiful. The water of the river is borne by us, and returns no more. The rough, the swollen, the turbid stream, we remember as it foamed and dashed along, threatening to sweep everything away; but it went swiftly by, and will never come back. So with afflictions. They are soon gone. The most intense pain soon subsides. The days of sorrow pass quickly away. There is an outer limit of suffering, and even ingenuity cannot prolong it far. The man disgraced, and whose life is a burden, will soon die. On the checks of the solitary prisoner doomed to the dungeon for life, a "mortal paleness" will soon settle down, and the comforts of approaching death will soothe the anguish of his sad heart. The rack of torture cheats itself of its own purpose, and the exhausted sufferer is released. "The excess (of grief) makes it soon mortal." "No sorrow but killed itself much sooner." Shakespeare. When we look back upon our sorrows, it is like thinking of the stream that was so much swollen, and was so impetuous. Its waters rolled on, and they come not back again; and there is a kind of pleasure in thinking of that time of danger, of that flood that was then so fearful, and that has now swept on to come back no more. So there is a kind of peaceful joy in thinking of the days of sorrow that are now fled forever; in the assurance that those sad times will never, never recur again. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16.

One might almost imagine that Zophar looks upon himself and the other two friends as forming such an "assembly:" they cannot justify him in opposition to God, since He accounts him guilty. God's mode of trial is summary, because infallible: He knows altogether &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1488; &#1502;&#1514;&#1497;, people who hypocritically disguise their moral nothingness (on this idea, vid., on <a href="/psalms/26-4.htm">Psalm 26:4</a>); and sees (looks through) &#1488;&#1493;&#1503; (from the root n, to breathe), otherwise grief, with which one pants, in a moral sense worthlessness, without any trace whatever of worth or substance. He knows and sees this moral wretchedness at once, and need not first of all reflect upon it: non opus habet, as Abenezra has correctly explained, ut diu consideret (comp. the like thought, <a href="/job/34-23.htm">Job 34:23</a>).<p><a href="/job/11-12.htm">Job 11:12</a> has been variously misinterpreted. Gesenius in his Handwrterbuch<p>(Note: Vid., Lexicon, Engl. edition, s.v. &#1500;&#1489;&#1489; Niphal. - Tr.)<p>translates: but man is empty and void of understanding; but this is contrary to the accentuation, according to which &#1504;&#1489;&#1493;&#1489; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; together form the subject. Olshausen translates better: an empty man, on the other hand, is without heart; but the fut. cannot be exactly so used, and if we consider that Piel has never properly a privative meaning, though sometimes a privative idea (as e.g., &#1505;&#1511;&#1468;&#1500;, operam consumere in lapidos, scil. ejiciendos), we must regard a privative Niphal as likewise inadmissible. Stickel translates peculiarly: the man devoid of understanding is enraged against God; but this is opposed to the manifest correlation of &#1504;&#1489;&#1493;&#1489; and &#1497;&#1500;&#1468;&#1489;&#1489;, which does not indicate the antithesis of an empty and sulky person (Bttcher): the former rather signifies empty, and the latter to acquire heart or marrow (Heidenheim, &#1500;&#1489; &#1497;&#1511;&#1504;&#1492;), so that &#1500;&#1489; fills up the hollow space. Hirzel's rendering partly bears out the requirement of this correlation: man has understanding like a hollow pate; but this explanation, like that of Gesenius, violates the accentuation, and produces an affected witticism. The explanation which regards <a href="/job/11-12.htm">Job 11:12</a> as descriptive of the wholesome effect of the discipline of the divine judgments (comp. <a href="/isaiah/26-9.htm">Isaiah 26:9</a>) is far better; it does not violate the accent, and moreover is more in accordance with the future form: the empty one becomes discerning thereby, the rough, humane (thus recently Ewald, Heiligst., Schlottm.); but according to this explanation, <a href="/job/11-12.htm">Job 11:12</a> is not connected with what immediately precedes, nor is the peculiarity of the expression fully brought out. Hupfeld opens up another way of interpreting the passage when he remarks, nil dicto facilius et simplicius; he understands <a href="/job/11-12.htm">Job 11:12</a> according to <a href="/job/11-12.htm">Job 11:12</a>: But man is furnished with an empty heart, i.e., receives at his birth an empty undiscerning heart, and man is born as a wild ass's colt, i.e., as stupid and obstinate. This thought is satisfactorily connected with the preceding; but here also &#1504;&#1489;&#1493;&#1489; is taken as predicate in violation of the accentuation, nor is justice done to the correlation above referred to, and the whole sentence is referred to the portion of man at his birth, in opposition to the impression conveyed by the use of the fut. Oehler appears to us to have recognised the right sense: But an empty man is as little endowed with sense, as that a wild ass should ever be born as man - be, so to speak, born again and become a man.<p>(Note: Wetzstein explains: "But a man that barks like a dog (i.e., rages shamelessly) can become sensible, and a young wild ass (i.e., the wildest and roughest creature) be born again as a man (i.e., become gentle and civilised)," from &#1504;&#1489;&#1489;  equals  &#1504;&#1489;&#1495;, since &#1504;&#1489;&#1495; is the commoner word for "barking" in the Syrian towns and villages, and &#1504;&#1489;&#1489;, on the other hand, is used among those who dwelt in tents. But we must then point it &#1504;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;, and the antithesis &#1497;&#1500;&#1468;&#1489;&#1489; is more favourable the Hebrew meaning, "hollowed out, empty.")<p>The waw in &#1493;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512; is just like <a href="/job/5-7.htm">Job 5:7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/12-11.htm">Job 12:11</a>, and brings into close connection the things that are to be compared, as in the form of emblematic proverbs (vid., Herzog's Real Encyklopdie, xiv. 696): the one will happen not earlier than, and as little as, the other. The Niphal &#1504;&#1493;&#1500;&#1491;, which in <a href="/proverbs/17-17.htm">Proverbs 17:17</a> signifies to become manifest, here borders on the notion of regenerari; a regeneration would be necessary if the wild ass should become human, - a regeneration which is inconceivable. It is by nature refractory, and especially when young (&#1493;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512; from Arab. &#8219;a&#770;r, fut. i in the signification vagari, huc illuc discurrere, of a young, restless, wild, frisking animal). Just so, says Zophar, the vacuum in an empty man is incapable of being filled up, - a side hit at Job, which rebounds on Zophar himself; for the dogma of the friends, which forms the sole contents of their hollowness, can indeed not fill with brightness and peace a heart that is passing through conflict. The peculiarity of the expression is no longer unintelligible; Zophar is the most impassioned of the three friends. </body></html>
