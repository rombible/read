In this way Job might have been a righteous man, and yet be justly chastened lest he should prove unrighteous.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/job/33.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>33:14-18 God speaks to us by conscience, by providences, and by ministers; of all these Elihu discourses. There was not then, that we know of, any Divine revelation in writing, though now it is our principal guide. When God designs men's good, by the convictions and dictates of their own consciences, he opens the heart, as Lydia's, and opens the ears, so that conviction finds or forces its way in. The end and design of these admonitions are to keep men from sin, particularly the sin of pride. While sinners are pursuing evil purposes, and indulging their pride, their souls are hastening to destruction. That which turns men from sin, saves them from hell. What a mercy it is to be under the restraints of an awakened conscience!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/33.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That he may withdraw man from his purpose - Margin, "work." The sense is plain. God designs to warn him of the consequences of executing a plan of iniquity. He alarms him by showing him that his course will lead to punishment, and by representing to him in the night visions, the dreadful woes of the future world into which he is about to plunge. The object is to deter him from committing the deed of guilt which he had contemplated, and to turn him to the paths of righteousness. Is it unreasonable to suppose that the same thing may occur now, and that God may have a purpose in the dreams which often visit the man who has formed a plan of iniquity, or who is living a life of sin? It cannot be doubted that such people often have alarming dreams; that these dreams are such as are fitted to deter them from the commission of their contemplated wickedness; and that in fact they not unfrequently do it.<p>What shall hinder us from supposing that God intends that the workings of the mind when the senses are locked in repose, shall be the means of alarming the guilty, and of leading them to reflection? Why should not mind thus be its own admonisher, and be made the instrument of restraining the guilty then, as really as by its sober reasonings and reflections when awake? Many a wicked man has been checked in a career of wickedness by a frightful dream; and not a few have been brought to a degree of reflection which has resulted in sound conversion by the alarm caused on the mind by having the consequences of a career of wickedness traced out in the visions of the night. The case of Colonel Gardiner cannot be forgotten - though in that instance it was rather "a vision of the night" than a dream. He was meditating an act of wickedness. and was alone in his room awaiting the appointed hour. In the silence of the night, and in the solitude of his room, he seemed to see the Savior on the cross. This view, however, it may be accounted for, restrained him from the contemplated act of wickedness, and he became an eminently pious man; see Doddridge's Life of Col. Gardiner. The mind, with all its faculties, is under the control of God, and no one can demonstrate that he does not make its actings, even in the wanderings of a dream, the designed means of checking the sinner, and of saving the soul.<p>And hide pride from man - Probably the particular thing which Elihu here referred to, was pride and arrogance toward God; or an insolent bearing toward him, and a reliance on one's own merits. This was the particular thing in Job which Elihu seems to have thought required animadversion, and probably he meant to intimate that all people had such communications from God by dreams as to save them from such arrogance. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/33.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17. purpose&#8212;Margin, "work." So Job 36:9. So "business" in a bad sense (1Sa 20:19). Elihu alludes to Job's words (Job 17:11). "Pride," an open "pit" (Job 33:18) which God hides or covers up, lest man should fall into it. Even the godly need to learn the lesson which trials teach, to "humble themselves under the mighty hand of God."<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/job/33.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">That he, </span> i.e. God, who was expressed <span class="bld"><a href="/job/33-14.htm" title="For God speaks once, yes twice, yet man perceives it not.">Job 33:14</a></span>, and designed by this pronoun he both in the foregoing and following verses. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">From his purpose, </span> i.e. from the execution of his purpose.

So this is noted as the design of God’s giving man this warning, to keep him from executing that evil work which possibly he had designed to do; of which see examples, <span class="bld"><a href="/genesis/20-5.htm" title="Said he not to me, She is my sister? and she, even she herself said, He is my brother: in the integrity of my heart and innocence of my hands have I done this.">Genesis 20:5</a>,6 31:24</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Hide pride, </span> i.e. either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

And <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">pride</span> is here mentioned as the root of those evil purposes or works last mentioned; which for the most part proceed from haughtiness of spirit, whereby men scorn to submit themselves and their wills and actions to God’s authority, and presume to advance themselves above God, and resolve to follow their own wills and lusts in spite of God, and with contempt of him.

Or "work" (m), his wicked work, as the Targum; either which he has begun upon, or which he designed to do. Thus Abimelech and Laban were restrained from their intentions by a divine admonition in a dream, the one from taking Abraham's wife, as he intended, and the other from doing harm to Jacob, which he designed: <p>and hide pride from man; by pardoning his sins, in which there is always pride, so some; pardon of sin being expressed by covering it, <a href="/psalms/32-1.htm">Psalm 32:1</a>; or rather by repressing, weakening, and preventing it; and that by not suffering vain and proud men to perform their enterprises, but obliging them to submit to the will of God, and humble themselves under his mighty hand. These are the ends proposed, and which are effected through the Lord speaking to men in dreams, opening their ears, and sending instructions to them; and others also for their good follow. <p>(m) "opere", Pagninus, Montanus, Mercerus, &amp;c. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/33.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">That he may withdraw man <i>from his</i> purpose, and hide <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> pride from man.</span><p>(i) He shows for why God sends afflictions: to beat down man's pride, and to turn from evil.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/job/33.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">17, 18</span>.

Elihu regards the Divine teaching through visions as intended to elevate and purify men. Sometimes God so works upon them as to make them abandon an evil course on which they had entered. Sometimes his object is to save them from indulgence in an evil temper into which, without his help, they might have fallen. In this latter case he may occasionally hide pride from man. Elihu, perhaps, thinks that Job is unduly proud of his integrity. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/33.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>  8  Verily thou hast said in mine ears,<p>And I heard the sound of thy words:<p>  9  "I am pure, without transgression;<p>"Spotless am I, and I have no guilt.<p>10  "Behold, He findeth malicious things against me,<p>"He regardeth me as His enemy;<p>11  "He putteth my feet in the stocks,<p>"He observeth all my paths."<p>12  Behold, therein thou art not right, I will answer thee,<p>For Eloah is too exalted for man.<p>With &#1488;&#1498; &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468; Elihu establishes the undeniable fact, whether it be that &#1488;&#1498; is intended as restrictive (only thou hast said, it is not otherwise than that thou ... ), or as we have translated, according to its primary meaning, affirmative (forsooth, it is undeniable).
