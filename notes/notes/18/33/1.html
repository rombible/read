He then begins to reprehend those passages which he thought blameable in Job’s speeches; particularly his insisting so much on his integrity, which, however evident, should not have been mentioned without due acknowledgment, that the Sovereign of the world had done him no wrong in thus afflicting him; urging that it was not proper for him to call in question the wisdom and justice of God’s providence, because he did not understand it, <a href="/context/job/33-1.htm" title="Why, Job, I pray you, hear my speeches, and listen to all my words....">Job 33:1-13</a>.

In the preceding chapter, Elihu directed his discourse to the three friends of Job chiefly, here to Job himself, and that by name; which none of his friends in all their discourses ever used; and in an humble suppliant manner entreats his attention to what he was about to deliver, and that for reasons which his address to his friends could furnish him with; and hence begins his speech with "wherefore", seeing he took not the part of his three friends, but blamed them; and because he had the Spirit of God in him, and was full of matter, and uneasy until he had vented it; and which he proposed to deliver in a plain and faithful manner, with sincerity and without flattery; on all which accounts be beseeches him to give him a diligent and attentive hearing: <p>and hearken to all my words; not to some of them only, but to all; he bespeaks his candid and constant attention, that he would hear him out, all that he had to say, with patience, and without interruption; and then judge of the truth, force, and pertinency of them; which he would not so well be able to do, unless he heard them all; for sometimes the proof, the evidence, and demonstration of a thing depends not on a single argument, but upon many put together; each of them alone being insufficient, at least may appear so, when all considered together give full satisfaction. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/33.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Wherefore, Job, I pray thee, hear my speeches, and hearken to all my words.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/job/33.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">1</span>.

After a brief exordium (vers. 1-7), he takes exception <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to Job's self-assertion (vers. 8, 9); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> to his charges against God (vers. 10-13), <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>which (he says) are unjust. He next brings forward his theory of God-inflicted sufferings being, in the main, chastisements proceeding from a loving purpose, intended to purify, to strengthen, to purge out faults, to "save from the pit," to improve, and to enlighten (vers. 14-24). He points out in what spirit chastisement should be received (vers. 25-30); and concludes with a recommendation to Job to remain silent, and hear him out, while at the same time he expresses a willingness to listen to what Job has to say, if he has objections to offer (vers. 31-33). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore, Job, I pray thee, hear my speeches</span>; rather, <span class="accented">howbeit</span>, <span class="accented">Job</span>, <span class="accented">I pray thee</span>, <span class="accented">hear my speech</span> (see the Revised Version); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "However you regard me personally, hear what I have to say." And hearken to all my words. Give me your <span class="accented">full</span> attention; do not suffer aught that I say to escape you. Elihu has a deep conviction of the importance of what he is about to utter (comp. <a href="/job/32-8.htm">Job 32:8, 10, 17</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/32.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>15  They are amazed, they answer no more,<p>Words have fled from them.<p>16  And I waited, for they spake not,<p>For they stand still, they answer no more.<p>17  Therefore I also will answer for my part,<p>I will declare my knowledge, even I.<p>In order to give a more rapid movement and an emotional force to the speech, the figure asyndeton is introduced in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/32-15.htm">Job 32:15</a>, as perhaps in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-7.htm">Jeremiah 15:7</a>, Ew. 349, a. Most expositors render &#1492;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468; passively, according to the sense: they have removed from them, i.e., are removed from them; but why may &#1492;&#1506;&#1514;&#1497;&#1511; not signify, like <a href="/genesis/12-8.htm">Genesis 12:8</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/26-22.htm">Genesis 26:22</a>, to move away, viz., the tent  equals  to wander on (Schlottm.)? The figure: words are moved away (as it were according to an encampment broken up) from them, i.e., as we say: they have left them, is quite in accordance with the figurative style of this section. It is unnecessary to take &#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1495;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/32-16.htm">Job 32:16</a>, with Ew. (342, c) 2 and Hirz. as perf. consec. and interrogative: and should I wait, because they speak no more? Certainly the interrog. part. sometimes disappears after the Waw of consequence, e.g., <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-13.htm">Ezekiel 18:13</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/18-24.htm">Ezekiel 18:24</a> (and will he live?); but by what would &#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1495;&#1500;&#1514;&#1497; be distinguished as perf. consec. here? Hahn's interpretation: I have waited, until they do not speak, for they stand ... , also does not commend itself; the poet would have expressed this by &#1506;&#1491; &#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1491;&#1489;&#1512;&#1493;, while the two &#1499;&#1497;, especially with the poet's predilection for repetition, appear to be co-ordinate. Elihu means to say that he has waited a long time, surprised that the three did not speak further, and that they stand still without speaking again. Therefore he thinks the time is come for him also to answer Job. &#1488;&#1506;&#1504;&#1492; cannot be fut. Kal, since where the 1 fut. Kal and Hiph. cannot be distinguished by the vowel within the word (as in the Ayin Awa and double Ayin verbs), the former has an inalienable Segol; it is therefore 1 fut. Hiph., but not as in <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-19.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:19</a> in the signification to employ labour upon anything (lxx &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3bd;), but in an intensive Kal signification (as &#1492;&#1494;&#1506;&#1497;&#1511; for &#1494;&#1506;&#1511;, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/35-9.htm">Job 35:9</a>, comp. on <a href="/job/31-18.htm">Job 31:18</a>): to answer, to give any one an answer when called upon. Ewald's supposedly proverbial: I also plough my field! (192, c, Anm. 2) does unnecessary violence to the usage of the language, which is unacquainted with this &#1492;&#1506;&#1504;&#1492;, to plough. It is perfectly consistent with Elihu's diction, that &#1495;&#1500;&#1511;&#1497; beside &#1488;&#1504;&#1497; as permutative signifies, "I, my part," although it might also be an acc. of closer definition (as pro parte mea, for my part), or even - which is, however, less probable - acc. of the obj. (my part). Elihu speaks more in the scholastic tone of controversy than the three. </body></html>
