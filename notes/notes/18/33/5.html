Without partiality he will speak, flattery is not his force. If by flattery he should deny the truth, his Maker would quickly carry him off. &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1506;&#1496; followed by subjunct. fut.: for a little (with disjunctive accent, because equivalent to haud multum abest quin), i.e., very soon indeed, or easily would or might ... ; &#1497;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1504;&#1497; (as <a href="/job/27-21.htm">Job 27:21</a>) seems designedly to harmonize with &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1504;&#1497;. </body></html>
