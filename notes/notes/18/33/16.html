By God’s <span class="ital">hiding pride from man </span>may be meant his taking it away, as he is said to hide sin when he removes the guilt and power of it. Or, <span class="ital">pride </span>may be here put for the occasion of it.

There was not then, that we know of, any Divine revelation in writing, though now it is our principal guide. When God designs men's good, by the convictions and dictates of their own consciences, he opens the heart, as Lydia's, and opens the ears, so that conviction finds or forces its way in. The end and design of these admonitions are to keep men from sin, particularly the sin of pride. While sinners are pursuing evil purposes, and indulging their pride, their souls are hastening to destruction. That which turns men from sin, saves them from hell. What a mercy it is to be under the restraints of an awakened conscience!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/33.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Then he openeth the ears of men - Margin, as in Hebrew "revealeth," or "uncovereth." The idea is, that he then reveals to the ear of man important admonitions or counsels. He communicates valuable truth. We are not to understand this as saying that the sleeper actually hears God speak, but as the ear is the organ of hearing, it is employed here to denote that God then communicates His will to human beinigs. In what way he had access to the souls of people by dreams, it is impossible to explain.<p>And sealeth their instruction - literally, "In their admonition he seals;" or he affixes a seal. The idea is, that he makes the admonition or instruction as secure as if a seal were affixed to it. A seal ratified or confirmed a contract, a will, or a deed, and the sense here is, that the communications of God to the soul were as firm as if they had been ratified in like manner. Or possibly it may mean, that the warnings of God were communicated to the soul like a sealed letter or message unknown to any other; that is, were made privately to the individual himself in the slumbers of the night. Others have understood the word rendered instruction, as denoting castigation, or punishment, and according to that explanation the meaning would be, that he announces to them certain punishment if they continued in sin; he made it as certain to them as if it were ratified by a seal. So Rosenmuller and Mercer. Schultens supposes it to be equivalent to inspires them, or communicates instruction by inspiration as if it were confirmed and ratified by a seal. He observes that the Arabic word hhatham is often used in the Koran, meaning to inspire. The Septuagint renders it, &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;  autous exephobe&#772;sen - "he terrifies them" - where they evidently read &#1497;&#1495;&#1514;&#1501;  yechathe&#772;m instead of &#1497;&#1495;&#1514;&#1501;  yachthom. The sense is, that God communicates warnings to people on their beds, in a manner as solemn and impressive as if it were ratified with a seal, and made as secure as possible. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/33.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16.

This is done partly by the impressive circumstances and manner of the dream; compare the impression produced on Eliphaz, after the model of whose vision the passage seems moulded. Perhaps the figure of “sealing” the instruction arises from the idea of closing up again the opened ear over the divine communication.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Others understand by “instruction” here the chastisement of affliction, assuming that the person to whom the vision was sent was one under trouble. “Instruction” is possibly used in this sense by Elihu, ch. <a href="/job/36-10.htm" title="He opens also their ear to discipline, and commands that they return from iniquity.">Job 36:10</a>; but in this chap. the case of affliction seems introduced first in <span class="ital"><a href="/job/33-19.htm" title="He is chastened also with pain on his bed, and the multitude of his bones with strong pain:">Job 33:19</a></span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/33.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their instruction</span>. At such times, Elihu holds, God gives men spiritual wisdom, instructs them, makes them understand his dealings with them and his purposes with respect to them. If Job is perplexed concerning the Almighty's ways with himself, and desires explanations, let him have his ear open to the Divine teaching on such occasions, and seriously lay it to heart. He will thus, it may be, find his perplexity diminished. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/33.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>  8  Verily thou hast said in mine ears,<p>And I heard the sound of thy words:<p>  9  "I am pure, without transgression;<p>"Spotless am I, and I have no guilt.<p>10  "Behold, He findeth malicious things against me,<p>"He regardeth me as His enemy;<p>11  "He putteth my feet in the stocks,<p>"He observeth all my paths."<p>12  Behold, therein thou art not right, I will answer thee,<p>For Eloah is too exalted for man.<p>With &#1488;&#1498; &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468; Elihu establishes the undeniable fact, whether it be that &#1488;&#1498; is intended as restrictive (only thou hast said, it is not otherwise than that thou ... ), or as we have translated, according to its primary meaning, affirmative (forsooth, it is undeniable).
