of all these Elihu discourses. There was not then, that we know of, any Divine revelation in writing, though now it is our principal guide. When God designs men's good, by the convictions and dictates of their own consciences, he opens the heart, as Lydia's, and opens the ears, so that conviction finds or forces its way in. The end and design of these admonitions are to keep men from sin, particularly the sin of pride. While sinners are pursuing evil purposes, and indulging their pride, their souls are hastening to destruction. That which turns men from sin, saves them from hell. What a mercy it is to be under the restraints of an awakened conscience!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/33.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He keepeth back his soul from the pit - The word soul in the Hebrew is often equivalent to self, and the idea is, that he keeps the man from the pit in this manner. The object of these warnings is to keep him from rushing on to his own destruction. The word rendered "pit" - &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1514;  shachath, properly means a pit, or pitfall, in which traps are laid for wild animals; <a href="/psalms/7-15.htm">Psalm 7:15</a>; <a href="/psalms/9-15.htm">Psalm 9:15</a>; then a cistern that is miry; <a href="/job/9-31.htm">Job 9:31</a>; a prison, <a href="/isaiah/51-14.htm">Isaiah 51:14</a>; then the grave, or sepulchre, as being often a cavern; <a href="/job/17-13.htm">Job 17:13</a>; <a href="/psalms/30-9.htm">Psalm 30:9</a>; see <a href="//biblehub.com/job/33-28.htm">Job 33:28</a>, <a href="/job/33-30.htm">Job 33:30</a>. It evidently means here the grave, and the sense is, that God thus warns people against pursuing a course of conduct which would lead them to destruction, or would speedily terminate their lives.<p>And his life from perishing by the sword - Margin, "passing by." The meaning of the Hebrew may be, "to keep his life from passing away by the sword;" as if the sword were the means by which the life or soul passed from the body. The word rendered sword here - &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495;  shelach is from &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495;  sha&#770;lach - to send, cast, hurl, and the reference is rather to something sent, as of an arrow, dart, javelin, than to a sword. The sense is not materially varied, and the idea referred to is that of a violent death. The meaning is, that God by these warnings would keep a man from such a course of life as would lead to a death by violence - either by punishment for his crime, or by being cut off in war. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/33.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18. his soul&#8212;his life.<p>the pit&#8212;the grave; a symbol of hell.<p>perishing by the sword&#8212;that is, a violent death; in the Old Testament a symbol of the future punishment of the ungodly.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/job/33.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">He keepeth back, </span> to wit, by these gracious admonitions, whereby he leads them to repentance, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">his soul; </span> either the man, who is oft expressed by this part; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">his life, </span> as the next branch explains it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">From the pit, </span> i.e. from the grave, from death or destruction. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">From perishing by the sword, </span> i.e. by some dreadful judgment of God which was ready to fall upon him. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/job/33.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>He keepeth back his soul from the pit,.... Or, "that he may keep back" (n); for this is another end and use of God's speaking unto men; it is to preserve them for the present from going down to the grave, the pit of corruption and destruction; so called because the bodies of men, being there laid, corrupt, and are entirely destroyed by worms, and turn to rottenness and dust; and to preserve them from the bottomless pit of everlasting ruin and destruction; for the Lord's people are reproved by him, that they may not be condemned with the world, <a href="/1_corinthians/11-32.htm">1 Corinthians 11:32</a>; <p>and his life from perishing by the sword; by the sword of men, which is one of God's sore judgments; or by the sword of the civil magistrate, the man spoken to being warned of God of committing these sins, which would bring him into the hands of such; or by the sword of divine justice; Jarchi interprets it of the sword of the angel of death; the word signifies a missive weapon, as a dart; so Mr. Broughton renders the words, "and his life from going on the dart": or, as another version has it, "lest it should go on under the cast of darts" (o); the darts of an enemy in war, or the fiery darts of Satan, <a href="/ephesians/6-16.htm">Ephesians 6:16</a>. <p>(n) "ut prohibeat", Mercerus, Piscator.

By these interpositions God may even save a man from utter ruin, when, but for them, he would have rushed upon it. He may cause a person -to give up designs or enterprises which would have brought him into danger, and perhaps led to his being slain with the sword. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/33.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>  8  Verily thou hast said in mine ears,<p>And I heard the sound of thy words:<p>  9  "I am pure, without transgression;<p>"Spotless am I, and I have no guilt.<p>10  "Behold, He findeth malicious things against me,<p>"He regardeth me as His enemy;<p>11  "He putteth my feet in the stocks,<p>"He observeth all my paths."<p>12  Behold, therein thou art not right, I will answer thee,<p>For Eloah is too exalted for man.<p>With &#1488;&#1498; &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468; Elihu establishes the undeniable fact, whether it be that &#1488;&#1498; is intended as restrictive (only thou hast said, it is not otherwise than that thou ... ), or as we have translated, according to its primary meaning, affirmative (forsooth, it is undeniable). To say anything &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1494;&#1504;&#1497; of another is in Hebrew equivalent to not saying it secretly, and so as to be liable to misconstruction, but aloud and distinctly. In <a href="//biblehub.com/job/33-9.htm">Job 33:9</a>, Elihu falls back on Job's own utterances, as <a href="//biblehub.com/job/9-21.htm">Job 9:21</a>, &#1514;&#1501; &#1488;&#1504;&#1497;; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/16-17.htm">Job 16:17</a>, &#1514;&#1508;&#1500;&#1514;&#1497; &#1494;&#1499;&#1492;; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/12-4.htm">Job 12:4</a>, where he calls himself &#1510;&#1491;&#1497;&#1511; &#1514;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, comp. <a href="/job/10-7.htm">Job 10:7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/13-18.htm">Job 13:18</a>, <a href="/job/13-23.htm">Job 13:23</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/23-10.htm">Job 23:10</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/27-5.htm">Job 27:5</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/29-1.htm">Job 29:1</a>, <a href="/job/31-1.htm">Job 31:1</a>.

In <a href="/job/33-10.htm">Job 33:10</a> Elihu also makes use of a word that does not occur in Job's mouth, viz., &#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;, which, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/14-34.htm">Numbers 14:34</a>, signifies "alienation," from &#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; (&#1492;&#1504;&#1497;&#1488;), to hinder, restrain, turn aside, abalienare, <a href="/numbers/32-7.htm">Numbers 32:7</a>; and according to the Arab. na'a (to rise heavily), <p>(Note: Nevertheless Zamachschari does not derive Arab. na&#770;wa&#770;, to treat with enmity, from Arab. n', but from nwy, so that na&#770;wa fula&#770;nan signifies "to have evil designs against any one, to meditate evil against one."
