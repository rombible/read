By whatever means we are kept back from the we shall bless the Lord for them at least, and should bless him for them though they be painful and distressing.

These remarks of Elihu imply great confidence in the truth of what he had to say, but they are not arrogant and disrespectful. He treats Job with the utmost deference; is willing to hear all that could be said in opposition to his own views, and is desirous of not wounding his feelings or doing injustice to his cause. It may be supposed that he paused here, to give Job an opportunity to reply, but as he made no remarks, he resumed his discourse in the following chapter. The views which he had expressed were evidently new to Job, and were entirely at variance with those of his three friends, and they appear to have been received by all with profound and respectful silence. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/33.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>32. justify&#8212;to do thee justice; and, if I can, consistently with it, to declare thee innocent. At Job 33:33 Elihu pauses for a reply; then proceeds in Job 34:1.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/job/33.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> i.e. What thy wisdom and duty is in thy circumstances. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/job/33.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>If not, hearken to me,.... If he had no objection to make, nor answer to return, then he desires he would attend and listen to what he had further to lay before him: <p>hold thy peace, and I shall teach thee wisdom. For though Job was a wise and good man, he might become wiser and more knowing; and indeed when instruction is given to a wise man, he will be yet wiser, <a href="/proverbs/9-9.htm">Proverbs 9:9</a>; and this may be received sometimes from persons inferior in age and abilities. Elihu proposed to teach him, as he did, natural, moral, and evangelical wisdom, especially the wisdom of God in his providential dealings with men, and what is man's highest wisdom under them; which is to be reconciled unto them, and patiently to submit, and to fear the Lord, and be careful not to offend him, which to do is wisdom and understanding. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/33.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">If not, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I shall teach thee wisdom.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/33.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If not, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I shall teach thee wisdom</span>. Elihu is certainly quite sufficiently impressed with the sense of his intellectual capacity. Job's silence may have been meant as a sort of tacit rebuke to him. Considering his youth (<a href="/job/32-6.htm">Job 32:6</a>), there is something of arrogance in the whole tone of his address, and especially in his notion that he could "teach Job wisdom." It is significant that neither now, when expressly invited to reply, nor at any subsequent point of the discourse, nor even at its close, does Job condescend to make any answer at all to Elihu's speech. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/33.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>25  His flesh swelleth with the freshness of youth,<p>He returneth to the days of his youth.<p>26  If he prayeth to Eloah, He showeth him favour,<p>So that he seeth His face with joy,<p>And thus He recompenseth to man his uprightness.<p>27  He singeth to men and saith:<p>"I had sinned and perverted what was straight,<p>"And it was not recompensed to me.<p>28  "He hath delivered my soul from going down into the pit,<p>"And my life rejoiceth in the light."<p>Misled by the change of the perf. and fut. in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/33-25.htm">Job 33:25</a>, Jer. translates <a href="/job/33-25.htm">Job 33:25</a> : consumta est caro ejus a suppliciis; Targ.: His flesh had been weakened (&#1488;&#1514;&#1495;&#1500;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;), or made thin (&#1488;&#1514;&#1511;&#1500;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;), more than the flesh of a child; Raschi: it had become burst (French &#1488;&#1513;&#1511;&#1493;&#1513;&#1488;, in connection with which only &#1508;&#1513;&#1473; appears to have been in his mind, in the sense of springing up, prendre son escousse) from the shaking (of disease). All these interpretations are worthless; &#1504;&#1506;&#1512;, peculiar to the Elihu section in the book of Job (here and <a href="/job/36-14.htm">Job 36:14</a>), does not signify shaking, but is equivalent to &#1504;&#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; (<a href="/job/13-26.htm">Job 13:26</a>; <a href="/job/31-18.htm">Job 31:18</a>); and &#1512;&#1496;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; is in the perf. only because the passive quadriliteral would not so easily accommodate itself to inflexion (by which all those asserted significations, which suit only the perf. sense, fall to the ground). The Chateph instead of the simple Sehev is only in order to give greater importance to the passive u. But as to the origin of the quadriliteral (on the four modes of the origin of roots of more than three radicals, vid., Jesurun, pp. 160-166), there is no reason for regarding it as a mixed form derived from two different verbs: it is formed just like &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1494; (from &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;, by Arabizing  equals  &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1474;) with a sibilant termination from &#1512;&#1496;&#1507;  equals  &#1512;&#1496;&#1489;, and therefore signifies to be (to have been made) over moist or juicy. However, there is yet another almost more commendable explanation possible. In Arab. t&#803;rfs&#780; signifies to recover, prop. to grow green, become fresh (perhaps from tarufa, as in the signification to blink, from tarafa). From this Arab. tarfasha, or even from a Hebr. &#1496;&#1512;&#1508;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;,<p>(Note: The Talmud. &#1496;&#1512;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488; &#1491;&#1500;&#1497;&#1489;&#1488; (Chullin, 49b) signifies, according to the customary rendering, the pericardium, and &#1496;&#1512;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488; &#1491;&#1499;&#1489;&#1491;&#1488; (ib. 46a) the diaphragm, or rather the little net (omentum minus). Originally, however, the former signified the cushion of fat under the pericardium on which the heart rests, especially in the crossing of the furrows; the latter the accumulation of fat on the porta (&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;) and between the laminae of the little net. For &#1496;&#1512;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; is correctly explained by &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1502;&#1503;, fat. It has nothing to do with &#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b6;&#x3b1; (an old name for a part of the liver), with which Ges. after Buxtorf connects it.)<p>pinguefacere (which may with Frst be regarded as springing from &#1496;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;, to be fleshy, like &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1500;, &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1505;&#1501;), &#1512;&#1496;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; might have sprung by transposition. In a remarkable manner one and the same idea is attained by all these ways: whether we regard &#1493;&#1496;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; as a mixed form from &#1512;&#1496;&#1489; and &#1496;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;, or as an extended root-form from one or other of these verbs, it is always according to the idea: a superabundance of fresh healthfulness. The &#1502;&#1503; or &#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512; is chiefly regarded as comparative: more than youth, i.e., leaving this behind, or exceeding it, Ew. 221, a; but <a href="//biblehub.com/job/33-25.htm">Job 33:25</a>, according to which he who was hitherto sick unto death actually renews his youth, makes it more natural to take the &#1502;&#1503; as causal: it swells from youth or youthfulness. In this description of the renovation which the man experiences, it is everywhere assumed that he has taken the right way announced to him by the mediating angel. Accordingly, <a href="/job/33-26.htm">Job 33:26</a> is not intended of prayer that is heard, which resulted in pardon, but of prayer that may be heard continually, which results from the pardon: if he prays to Eloah (fut. hypotheticum as <a href="//biblehub.com/job/22-27.htm">Job 22:27</a>, vid., on <a href="/job/29-24.htm">Job 29:24</a>), He receives him favourably (&#1512;&#1510;&#1492;, Arab. rad&#803;iya, with &#1489;, Arab. b, to have pleasure in any one, with the acc. eum gratum vel acceptum habere), and he (whose state of favour is now established anew) sees God's countenance (which has been hitherto veiled from him, <a href="/job/34-29.htm">Job 34:29</a>) with rejoicing (as <a href="/psalms/33-3.htm">Psalm 33:3</a> and freq.), and He (God) recompenses to the man his uprightness (in his prolonged course of life), or prop., since it is not &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1501;, but &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;, He restores on His part his relation in accordance with the order of redemption, for that is the idea of &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1492;; the word has either a legal or a so-to-speak evangelical meaning, in which latter, used of God (as so frequently in Isaiah II), it describes His rule in accordance with His counsel and order of redemption; the primary notion is strict observance of a given rule.<p>In <a href="/job/33-27.htm">Job 33:27</a> the favoured one is again the subj. This change of person, without any indication of the same, belongs to the peculiarities of the Hebrew, and, in general, of the Oriental style, described in the Geschichte der jd. Poesie, S. 189 [History of Jewish Poetry;] the reference of &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;, as Hiph., to God, which is preferred by most expositors, is consequently unnecessary. Moreover, the interpretation: He causes his (the favoured one's) countenance to behold joy (Umbr., Ew.), is improbable as regards the phrase (&#1504;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492;) &#1512;&#1488;&#1492; &#1508;&#1504;&#1497; &#1492;, and also syntactically lame; and the interpretation: He causes (him, the favoured one) to behold His (the divine) countenance with joy (Hirz., Hahn, Schlottm., and others), halts in like manner, since this would be expressed by &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; (&#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;). By the reference to psalmody which follows in <a href="/job/33-27.htm">Job 33:27</a> (comp. <a href="/job/36-24.htm">Job 36:24</a>), it becomes natural that we should understand <a href="/job/33-26.htm">Job 33:26</a> according to such passages in the Psalms as <a href="/psalms/90-2.htm">Psalm 90:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/67-2.htm">Psalm 67:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/17-15.htm">Psalm 17:15</a>. &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512; is a poetically contracted fut. after the manner of a jussive, for &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;; and perhaps it is a dialectic form, for the Kal &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;  equals  &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1512; occurs only besides in <a href="/1_samuel/18-6.htm">1 Samuel 18:6</a> as Chethb.
