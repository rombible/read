When we hear any thing said to God's dishonour, we ought to bear our testimony against it. Job had represented God as severe in marking what he did amiss. Elihu urges that he had spoken wrong, and that he ought to humble himself before God, and by repentance to unsay it. God is not accountable to us. It is unreasonable for weak, sinful creatures, to strive with a God of infinite wisdom, power, and goodness. He acts with perfect justice, wisdom, and goodness, where we cannot perceive it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/33.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Why dost thou strive against him? - By refusing to submit to him, and by calling in question his wisdom and goodness.<p>For he giveth not account of any of his matters - Margin, as in Hebrew "answereth not." The idea is, that it is as useless as it is improper to contend with God. He does his own pleasure, and deals with man as he deems best and right. The reason of his doings he does not state, nor has man any power to extort from him a statement of the causes why he afflicts us. This is still true. The reason of his doings he does not often make known to the afflicted, and it is impossible to know now the causes why he has brought on us the calamity with which we are visited. The general reasons why men are afflicted may be better known now than they were in the time of Elihu, for successive revelations have thrown much light on that subject. But when he comes and afflicts us as individuals; when he takes away a beloved child; when he cuts down the young, the vigorous, the useful, and the pious, it is often impossible to understand why he has done it.<p>All that we can do then is to submit to his sovereign will, and to believe that though we cannot see the reasons why he has done it, yet that does not prove that there are no reasons, or that we may never be permitted to understand them. We are required to submit to his will, not to our own reason; to acquiesce because he does it, not because we see it to be right. If we always understood the reasons why he afflicts us, our resignation would be not to the will of God, but to our own knowledge of what is right; and God, therefore, often passes before us in clouds and thick darkness to see whether we have sufficient confidence in him to believe that he does right, even when we cannot see or understand the reason of his doings. So a child reposes the highest confidence in a parent, when he believes that the parent will do right, though he cannot understand why he does it, and the parent does not choose to let him know. May not a father see reasons for what he does which a child could not understand, or which it might be proper for him to withhold from him? <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/33.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13.

And therefore, O Job, thou exceedest all bounds of modesty, and humility, and reverence, and submission, which thou owest to thy Maker, in that thou presumest to demand a reason for his dealings with thee, and to quarrel with him for not giving it to thee at thy desire. Or, <span class="ital">he answereth not all his words</span>, i.e. he doth not say, or hath not said, all that he can to justify his actions, which he can do many more ways than we can imagine; but hath revealed so much of his will and ways to mankind as he hath thought meet, and as their narrow capacity can comprehend; as he declareth in the following verses. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/job/33.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Why dost thou strive against him?.... A creature against the Creator, a man against his Maker, the clay against the potter; how absurd and stupid is this! and a piece of weakness and folly it was in him to desire to litigate the point with God, and dispute with him, as he often did, when men cannot answer him one of a thousand, as he himself owned, <a href="/job/9-3.htm">Job 9:3</a>; and very sinful and criminal it is to chide with God, or complain of him, on account of any of his dealings with the sons of men, as well as it is vain and fruitless: <p>for he giveth not account of any of his matters; he is a sovereign Being, and does what he pleases in nature, providence, and grace, and is not accountable to any for what he does; in things temporal, he does all after the counsel of his will; he bestows riches and honours, wealth and health, gifts of natural wisdom and knowledge on some, and withholds them from others; and each of these are his own, and he may do with them as he pleases: so likewise in things spiritual, he loves, chooses, redeems, regenerates, calls by his grace, and brings to glory whom he thinks fit; the blessings of grace and glory are his own, and he disposes of them as seems good in his sight; and in all respects he acts according to his will in heaven and in earth; none can stay his hand, or hinder him from doing his pleasure; and none ought to say to him, what dost thou? or why dost thou thus? or, if they do, he is not obliged to give any reasons for his so doing. Some take this to be the thing Job strove and contended with God about, that he did not, and because he did not give an account of all his matters, or answer all his words; and particularly he did not show to him wherefore he contended with him; and others think the meaning is, that God does not reveal all his secrets to men, but only as much as he thinks fit to acquaint them with; secret things belong to him, and things revealed to men; the secrets of his own nature, and the modes of subsistence of the divine Persons in the Godhead, the secret reasons of divine predestination of men to life or death, and of his dealings with men in a providential way, afflicting the righteous, and suffering the wicked to prosper. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/33.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> account of any of his matters.</span><p>(e) The cause of his judgments is not always declared to man.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/job/33.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">13–28</span>. When Elihu gives the general answer to Job’s charges against God that “God is greater than man” he means that the moral loftiness of God’s nature made it impossible that He should act in the arbitrary, hostile manner charged against Him by Job (comp. ch. <a href="/job/36-5.htm" title="Behold, God is mighty, and despises not any: he is mighty in strength and wisdom.">Job 36:5</a>). It was but another form of the same charge of arbitrary hostility to man when Job affirmed that God was deaf to all appeal and refused to speak to man; comp. ch. <a href="/job/19-7.htm" title="Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry aloud, but there is no judgment.">Job 19:7</a>, <a href="/job/30-20.htm" title="I cry to you, and you do not hear me: I stand up, and you regard me not.">Job 30:20</a>, and often. To this general form of the charge Elihu directs his attention and replies that God speaks to man in many ways, though He may not answer when challenged as Job had challenged Him; comp. ch. <a href="/job/35-14.htm" title="Although you say you shall not see him, yet judgment is before him; therefore trust you in him.">Job 35:14</a>. He speaks to man in ways becoming His greatness, ways that shew that His goodness is over all His works. <a href="/job/33-13.htm" title="Why do you strive against him? for he gives not account of any of his matters.">Job 33:13</a> probably reads<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Why dost thou contend against him<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>That he giveth not account of any of his matters?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>that is, Job’s contention or plea against God is that He deals arbitrarily and refuses all account of His dealing.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/33.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Why dost thou strive against him?</span> Why dost thou insist on taking the attitude of one who contends with God, who would fain enter into a controversy with him, and force him to plead in his own defence? It is not alone his omnipotence that makes such conduct folly, but his remoteness, his inaccessibility. He cannot be forced to make answer; it is not his wont to do so; he giveth not account of any of his matters. It is presumptuous to suppose that God will condescend to reveal himself from heaven and make answer to thy overbold challenges. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/33.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>  4  The Spirit of God hath made me,<p>And the breath of the Almighty hath given me life.<p>  5  If thou canst, answer me,<p>Prepare in my presence, take thy stand!<p>  6  Behold, I am like thyself, of God,<p>Formed out of clay am Ialso.<p>  7  Behold, my terror shall not affright thee,<p>And my pressure shall not be heavy upon thee.<p>He has both in common with Job: the spirituality as well as the earthliness of man's nature; but by virtue of the former he does not, indeed, feel himself exalted above Job's person, but above the present standpoint taken up by Job; and in consideration of this, Job need not fear any unequal contest, nor as before God, <a href="/job/9-34.htm">Job 9:34</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/13-21.htm">Job 13:21</a>, in order that he may be able to defend himself against Him, make it a stipulation that His majesty may not terrify him. It is man's twofold origin which Elihu, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/33-4.htm">Job 33:4</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/33-6.htm">Job 33:6</a>, gives utterance to in harmony with <a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a> : the mode of man's origin, which is exalted above that of all other earthly beings that have life; for the life of the animal is only the individualizing of the breath of the Divine Spirit already existing in matter. The spirit of man, on the contrary (for which the language has reserved the name &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1492;), is an inspiration directly coming forth from God the personal being, transferred into the bodily frame, and therefore forming a person.<p>(Note: God took a small piece of His own life - says the tradition among the Karens, a scattered tribe of Eastern India - blew into the nostrils of His son and daughter, and they became living beings, and were really human.)<p>In the exalted consciousness of having been originated by the Spirit of God, and being endowed with life from the inbreathed breath of the Almighty, Elihu stands invincible before Job: if thou canst, refute me (&#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489; with acc. of the person, as <a href="/job/33-32.htm">Job 33:32</a>); array thyself (&#1506;&#1512;&#1499;&#1492; for &#1506;&#1512;&#1499;&#1492;, according to Ges. 63, rem. 1) before me (here with the additional thought of &#1502;&#1500;&#1495;&#1502;&#1492;, as <a href="//biblehub.com/job/23-4.htm">Job 23:4</a>, in a forensic sense with &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;), place thyself in position, or take thy post (imper. Hithpa. with the ah less frequent by longer forms, Ew. 228, a).<p>On the other side, he also, like Job, belongs to God, i.e., is dependent and conditioned. &#1492;&#1503;&#1470;&#1488;&#1504;&#1497; is to be written with Segol (not Ssere); &#1500;&#1488;&#1500; is intended like &#1500;&#1493;, <a href="/job/12-16.htm">Job 12:16</a>; and &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1497;&#1498; signifies properly, according to thine utterance, i.e., standard, in accordance with, i.e., like thee, and is used even in the Pentateuch (e.g., <a href="/exodus/16-21.htm">Exodus 16:21</a>) in this sense pro ratione; &#1499;&#1508;&#1497;, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/30-18.htm">Job 30:18</a>, we took differently. He, Elihu, is also nipped from the clay, i.e., taken from the earth, as when the potter nips off a piece of his clay (comp. Aram. &#1511;&#1512;&#1509;, a piece, Arab. qurs, a bread-cake, or a dung-cake, vid., supra, p. 449, from qarasa, to pinch off, take off, cogn. qarada, to gnaw off, cut off, p. 512). Thus, therefore, no terribleness in his appearing will disconcert Job, and his pressure will not be a burden upon him. By a comparison of <a href="//biblehub.com/job/13-21.htm">Job 13:21</a>, it might seem that &#1488;&#1499;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497; is equivalent to &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497; (lxx &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c1; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;), but &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1491; is everywhere connected only with &#1497;&#1491;, never with &#1499;&#1468;&#1507;; and the &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;. is explained according to <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/16-26.htm">Proverbs 16:26</a>, where &#1488;&#1499;&#1507; signifies to oppress, drive (Jer. compulit), and from the dialects differently, for in Syr. ecaf signifies to be anxious about anything (ecaf li, it causes me anxiety, curae mihi est), and in Arab. accafa, to saddle, uca&#770;f, Talmud. &#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1507;, a saddle, so that consequently the Targ. translation of &#1488;&#1499;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497; by &#1496;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;, my burden, and the Syr. by &#1488;&#1493;&#1499;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;, my pressing forward (Arabic version iqba&#770;li, my touch), are supported, since &#1488;&#1499;&#1507; signifies pressure, heavy weight, load, and burden; according to which it is also translated by Saad. (my constraint), Gecat. (my might). It is therefore not an opponent who is not on an equality with him by nature, with whom Job has to do. If he is not able to answer him, he will have to be considered as beaten. </body></html>
