In view of what has been just said. Or perhaps the word means merely certainly, truly.<p>Do my thoughts cause me to answer - This is variously rendered. The Vulgate renders it, Idcirco cogitationes meae variae succedunt sibi, et mens in diversa rapitur - "Therefore my various thoughts follow in succession, and the mind is distracted." The Septuagint, "I did not suppose that thou wouldst speak against these things, and you do not understand more than I." How this was ever made from the Hebrew it is impossible to say. On the word "thoughts," see the notes at <a href="/job/4-13.htm">Job 4:13</a>. The word denotes thoughts which divide and distract the mind; not calm and collected reflections, but those which disturb, disconcert, and trouble. He acknowledges that it was not calm reflection which induced him to reply, but the agitating emotions produced by the speech of Job. The word rendered "cause me to answer" (&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;  yesh&#305;&#770;ybu&#770;n&#305;&#770;y), "cause me to return" - and Jerome understood it as meaning that his thoughts returned upon him in quick and troublesome succession, and says in his Commentary on Job, that the meaning is, "I am troubled and agitated because you say that you sustain these evils from God without cause, when nothing evil ought to be suspected of God."<p>And for this I make haste - Margin, "my haste is in me." The meaning is, "the impetuosity of my feelings urges me on. I reply on account of the agitation of my soul, which will admit of no delay." His heart was full, and he hastened to give vent to his feelings in impassioned and earnest language. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/20.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2.

His natural strength becomes more and more feeble, and his voice weaker and weaker. It is a feeling of sadness that prevails in the preceding description of suffering, and now even stamps the address to the friends with a tone of importunate entreaty which shall, if possible, affect their heart. They are indeed his friends, as the emphatic &#1512;&#1506;&#1497; &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501; affirms; impelled towards him by sympathy they are come, and at least stand by him while all other men flee from him. They are therefore to grant him favour (&#1495;&#1504;&#1503;, prop. to incline to) in the place of right; it is enough that the hand of Eloah has touched him (in connection with this, one is reminded that leprosy is called &#1504;&#1490;&#1506;, and is pre-eminently accounted as plaga divina; wherefore the suffering Messiah also bears the significant name &#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488; &#1491;&#1489;&#1497; &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;, "the leprous one from the school of Rabbi," in the Talmud, after <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4</a>, <a href="/isaiah/53-8.htm">Isaiah 53:8</a>), they are not to make the divine decree heavier to him by their uncharitableness. Wherefore do ye persecute me - he asks them in <a href="/job/19-22.htm">Job 19:22</a> - like as God (&#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1470;&#1488;&#1500;, according to Saad. and Ralbag  equals  &#1499;&#1502;&#1493;&#1470;&#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;, which would be very tame); by which he means not merely that they add their persecution to God's, but that they take upon themselves God's work, that they usurp to themselves a judicial divine authority, they act towards him as if they were superhuman (vid., <a href="/isaiah/31-3.htm">Isaiah 31:3</a>), and therefore inhumanly, since they, who are but his equals, look down upon him from an assumed and false elevation. The other half of the question: wherefore are ye not full of my flesh (de ma chair, with &#1502;&#1503;, as <a href="/job/31-31.htm">Job 31:31</a>), but still continue to devour it? is founded upon a common Semitic figurative expression, with which may be compared our Germ. expression, "to gnaw with the tooth of slander" comp. Engl. "backbiting". In Chaldee, &#1488;&#1499;&#1500; &#1511;&#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1492;&#1497; &#1491;&#1497;, to eat the pieces of (any one), is equivalent to, to slander him; in Syriac, ochelqarsso is the name of Satan, like &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;. The Arabic here, as almost everywhere in the book of Job, presents a still closer parallel; for Arab. 'kl lh&#803;m signifies to eat any one's flesh, then (different from &#1488;&#1499;&#1500; &#1489;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;, <a href="/psalms/27-2.htm">Psalm 27:2</a>) equivalent to, to slander, <p>(Note: Vid., Schultens' ad Prov. Meidanii, p. 7 (where "to eat his own flesh," equivalent to "himself," without allowing others to do it, signifies to censure his kinsmen), and comp. the phrase Arab. aclu-l-a&#8219;ra&#770;dhi in the signification arrodere existimationem hominum in Makkari, i. 541, 13.)<p>since an evil report is conceived of as a wild beast, which delights in tearing a neighbour to pieces, as the friends do not refrain from doing, since, from the love of their assumption that his suffering must be the retributive punishment of heinous sins, they lay sins to his charge of which he is not conscious, and which he never committed. Against these uncharitable and groundless accusations he wishes (<a href="/job/19-23.htm">Job 19:23</a>) that the testimony of his innocence, to which they will not listen, might be recorded in a book for posterity, or because a book may easily perish, graven in a rock (therefore not on leaden plates) with an iron style, and the addition of lead, with which to fill up the engraved letters, and render them still more imperishable. In connection with the remarkable fidelity with which the poet throws himself back into the pre-Israelitish patriarchal time of his hero, it is of no small importance that he ascribes to him an acquaintance not only with monumental writing, but also with book and documentary writing (comp. <a href="/job/31-35.htm">Job 31:35</a>).<p>The fut., which also elsewhere (<a href="/job/6-8.htm">Job 6:8</a>; <a href="/job/13-5.htm">Job 13:5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/14-13.htm">Job 14:13</a>, once the praet., <a href="//biblehub.com/job/23-3.htm">Job 23:3</a>, noverim) follows &#1502;&#1497;&#1470;&#1497;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503;, quis dabat  equals  utinam, has Waw consec. here (as <a href="/deuteronomy/5-26.htm">Deuteronomy 5:26</a> the praet.); the arrangement of the words is extremely elegant, &#1489;&#1468;&#1505;&#1468;&#1508;&#1512; stands per hyperbaton emphatically prominent. &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1489; and &#1495;&#1511;&#1511; (whence fut.
