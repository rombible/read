The triumph of the wicked and the joy of the hypocrite are fleeting. The pleasures and gains of sin bring disease and pain; they end in remorse, anguish, and ruin. Dissembled piety is double iniquity, and the ruin that attends it will be accordingly.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Though his excellency mount up to the heavens - Though he attain to the highest pitch of honor and prosperity. The Septuagint renders this, "Though his gifts should go up to heaven, and his sacrifice should touch the clouds;" a sentence conveying a true and a beautiful idea, but which is not a translation of the Hebrew. The phrases, to go up to heaven, and to touch the clouds, often occur to denote anything that is greatly exalted, or that is very high. Thus, in Virgil,<p>It clamor coelo.<p>So Horace,<p>Sublimi feriam sidera vertice.<p>And again,<p>Attingit solium Joyis.<p>Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/11-4.htm">Genesis 11:4</a>, "Let us build us a tower whose top may reach unto heaven." In Homer the expression not unfrequently occurs, &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c1; &#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b9;&#788;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;  tou gar kleos ouranon hikei. In Seneca (Thyest. Act. v. ver. 1, 2,4,) similar expressions occur:<p>Aequalis astris gradior, et cunctos super<p>Altum superbo vertice attingens polum,<p>Dimitto superos: summa votorum attigi.<p>The "language" of Zophar would also well express the condition of many a hypocrite whose piety seems to be of the most exalted character, and who appears to have made most eminent attainments in religion. Such a man may "seem" to be a man of uncommon excellence. He may attract attention as having extraordinary sanctity. He may seem to have a remarkable spirit of prayer, and yet all may be false and hollow. Men who design to be hypocrites, aim usually to be "eminent" hypocrites; they who have true piety often, alas, aim at a much lower standard. A hypocrite cannot keep himself in countenance, or accomplish his purpose of imposing on the world, without the appearance of extraordinary devotedness to God; many a sincere believer is satisfied with much less of the appearance of religion. He is sincere and honest. He is conscious of true piety, and he attempts to impose on none. At the same time he makes no attempt scarcely "to be" what the hypocrite wishes "to appear" to be; and hence, the man that shall appear to be the most eminently devoted to God "may" be a hypocrite - yet usually not long. His zeal dies away, or he is suffered to fall into open sin, and to show that he had no true religion at heart. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/20.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6.

Bibl. d. bibl. Lit. i. 3, 1787, von Clln, BCr., Knapp, von Hofm., <p>(Note: Von Hofmann (Schriftbeweis, ii. 2, 503) translates: "I know, however, my Redeemer is living, and hereafter He will stand forth which must have been &#1497;&#1506;&#1502;&#1491; instead of &#1497;&#1511;&#1493;&#1501;] upon the earth and after my skin, this surrounding (&#1504;&#1511;&#1468;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468;, Chaldaism, instead of &#1504;&#1511;&#1468;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; after the form &#1506;&#1511;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;), and from my flesh shall I behold God, whom I shall behold for myself, and my eyes see [Him], and He is not strange.")<p>and others), but hereby the relation of <a href="/job/19-26.htm">Job 19:26</a> to <a href="/job/19-26.htm">Job 19:26</a> becomes a contrast, without there being anything to indicate it. Moreover, this rendering, as &#1502;&#1489;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497; may also be explained, is in itself contrary to the spirit and plan of the book; for the character of Job's present state of mind is, that he looks for certain death, and will hear nothing of the consolation of recovery (<a href="//biblehub.com/job/17-10.htm">Job 17:10-16</a>), which sounds to him as mere mockery; that he, however, notwithstanding, does not despair of God, but, by the consciousness of his innocence and the uncharitableness of the friends, is more and more impelled from the God of wrath and caprice to the God of love, his future Redeemer; and that then, when at the end of the course of suffering the actual proof of God's love breaks through the seeming manifestation of wrath, even that which Job had not ventured to hope is realized: a return of temporal prosperity beyond his entreaty and comprehension.<p>On the other hand, the mode of interpretation of the older translators and expositors, who find an expression of the hope of a resurrection at the end of the preceding strophe or the beginning of this, cannot be accepted.
