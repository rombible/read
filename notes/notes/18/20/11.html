The lusts of the flesh are here called the sins of his youth. His hiding it and keeping it under his tongue, denotes concealment of his beloved lust, and delight therein. But He who knows what is in the heart, knows what is under the tongue, and will discover it. The love of the world, and of the wealth of it, also is wickedness, and man sets his heart upon these. Also violence and injustice, these sins bring God's judgments upon nations and families. Observe the punishment of the wicked man for these things. Sin is turned into gall, than which nothing is more bitter; it will prove to him poison; so will all unlawful gains be. In his fulness he shall be in straits, through the anxieties of his own mind. To be led by the sanctifying grace of God to restore what was unjustly gotten, as Zaccheus was, is a great mercy. But to be forced to restore by the horrors of a despairing conscience, as Judas was, has no benefit and comfort attending it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>His bones are full of the sin of his youth - The words "of the sin" in our common translation are supplied by the translators. Gesenius and Noyes suppose that the Hebrew means, "His bones are full of youth;" that is, full of vigor and strength, and the idea according to this would be, that he would be cut off in the fulness of his strength. Dr. Good renders it forcibly,<p>"His secret lusts shall follow his bones,<p>Yea, they shall press upon him in the dust."<p>The Vulgate renders it, "His bones are full of the sins of his youth." The Septuagint, "His bones are full of his youth." The Chaldee Paraphrase, "His bones are full of his strength." The Hebrew literally is, "His bones are full of his secret things" (&#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;  &#8219;a&#770;lu&#770;ma&#772;y&#770;) - referring, as I suppose, to the "secret, long-cherished" faults of his life; the corrupt propensities and desires of his soul which had been seated in his very nature, and which would adhere to him, leaving a withering influence on his whole system in advancing years. The effect is that which is so often seen, when vices corrupt the very physical frame, and where the results are seen long in future life. The effect would be seen in the diseases which they engendered in his system, and in the certainty with which they would bring him down to the grave. The Syriac renders it, "marrow," as if the idea were that he would die full of vigor and strength. But the sense is rather that his secret lusts would work his certain ruin.<p>Which shall lie down with him - That is, the results of his secret sins shall lie down with him in the grave. He will never get rid of them. He has so long indulged in his sins; they have so thoroughly pervaded his nature, and he so delights to cherish them, that they will attend him to the tomb. There is truth in this representation. Wicked people often indulge in secret sin so long that it seems to pervade the whole system. Nothing will remove it; and it lives and acts until the body is committed to the dust, and the soul sinks ruined into hell. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/20.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. (Ps 25:7), so Vulgate. Gesenius has "full of youth"; namely, in the fulness of his youthful strength he shall be laid in the dust. But "bones" plainly alludes to Job's disease, probably to Job's own words (Job 19:20). Umbreit translates, "full of his secret sins," as in Ps 90:8; his secret guilt in his time of seeming righteousness, like secret poison, at last lays him in the dust. The English Version is best. Zophar alludes to Job's own words (Job 17:16).<p>with him&#8212;His sin had so pervaded his nature that it accompanies him to the grave: for eternity the sinner cannot get rid of it (Re 22:11).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/job/20.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">His bones, </span> i.e. his whole body, even the strongest parts of it, which may seem most remote from danger. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Of the sin of his youth, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">of his youth</span>, i.e. of his youthful pleasures and lusts, by a metonymy of the subject.

Man is born in sin, and is a transgressor from the womb; and the youthful age is addicted to many sins, as pride, passion, lust, luxury, intemperance, and uncleanness; and these are sometimes brought to mind, and men are convinced of them, and corrected for them, when more advanced in years; and if not stopped in them, and reformed from them, they are continued in an old age; and the effects of them are seen in bodily diseases, which a debauched life brings upon them, not only to the rottenness and consumption of their flesh, but to the putrefaction of their bones; though this may be understood of the whole body, the bones, the principal and stronger parts, being put for the whole, and denote that general decay and waste which gluttony, drunkenness, and uncleanness, bring into, see <a href="/proverbs/5-11.htm">Proverbs 5:11</a>; Some interpret this of "secret" sins (p), as the word is thought to signify, which, if not cleansed from and pardoned, will be found and charged on them, and be brought into judgment, and they punished for them, <a href="/psalms/90-8.htm">Psalm 90:8</a>; <p>which shall lie down with him in the dust: to be in the dust is to be in the state of the dead, to lie in the grave, where men lie down and sleep as on a bed; and this is common to good and bad men, all sleep in the dust of the earth, but with this difference, the sins of wicked men lie down with them; as they live in sin, they die in their sins; not that their sins die with them, and are no more, but they continue on them, and with them, and will rise with them, and will follow them to judgment, and remain with them after, and the guilt and remorse of which will be always on their consciences, and is that worm that never dies: of such it is said, that they "are gone down to hell with their weapons of war"; with the same enmity against God, against Christ, and his people, and all that is good, they had in their lifetime: and "they have laid their swords under their heads"; in the grave, and shall rise with the same revengeful spirit they ever had against the saints, see <a href="/revelation/20-8.htm">Revelation 20:8</a>; "but their iniquities shall be upon their bones"; both them, and the punishment of them, <a href="/ezekiel/32-27.htm">Ezekiel 32:27</a>.

Ewald observes: "&#1489;&#1506;&#1489;&#1493;&#1512; stands without addition, because this is easily understood from the &#1499;&#1503; in &#1500;&#1499;&#1503;." But although this ellipsis is not inadmissible (comp. &#1500;&#1499;&#1503;  equals  &#1500;&#1499;&#1503; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, <a href="/job/34-25.htm">Job 34:25</a>; &#1499;&#1506;&#1500;, <a href="/isaiah/59-18.htm">Isaiah 59:18</a>), in spite of it <a href="/job/20-2.htm">Job 20:2</a> furnishes no meaning that can be accepted. Most expositors translate: "and hence the storm within me" (thus e.g., Ewald); but the signification perturbatio animi, proposed by Schultens for &#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;, after the Arab. h&#803;a&#770;s&#780;, is too remote from the usage of Hebrew. Moreover, this Arab. h&#803;a&#770;s&#780; signifies prop. to scare, hunt, of game; not, however: to be agitated, to storm, - a signification which even the corresponding Hebr. &#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;, properare, does not support. Only a few expositors (as Umbreit, who translates: because of my storm within me) take &#1489;&#1506;&#1489;&#1493;&#1512; (which occurs only this once in the book of Job) as praepos., as it must be taken in consideration of the infin. which follows (comp. <a href="/exodus/9-16.htm">Exodus 9:16</a>; <a href="/exodus/20-20.htm">Exodus 20:20</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/1-6.htm">1 Samuel 1:6</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/10-3.htm">2 Samuel 10:3</a>). Further, &#1500;&#1499;&#1503; (only by Umbreit translated by "yet," after the Arab. la&#770;kin, la&#770;kinna, which it never signifies in Hebr., where &#1500; is not  equals  &#1500;&#1488;, but  equals  &#1500; with Kametz before the tone) with that which follows is referred by several expositors to the preceding speech of Job, e.g., Hahn: "under such circumstances, if thou behavest thus;" by most, however, it is referred to <a href="//biblehub.com/job/20-3.htm">Job 20:3</a>, e.g., Ew.: "On this account he feels called upon by his thoughts to answer, and hence his inward impulse leaves him no rest: because he hears from Job a contemptuous wounding reproof of himself." In other words: in consequence of the reproach which Job casts upon him, especially with his threat of judgment, Zophar's mind and feelings fall into a state of excitement, and give him an answer to which he now gives utterance. This prospective sense of &#1500;&#1499;&#1503; may at any rate be retained, though &#1489;&#1506;&#1489;&#1493;&#1512; is taken as a preposition (wherefore ... and indeed on account of my inward commotion); but it is far more natural that the beginning of Zophar's speech should be connected with the last word of Job's. <a href="/job/20-2.htm">Job 20:2</a> may really be so understood if we connect &#1495;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;, not with Arab. h&#803;a&#770;s&#780;, &#1495;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;, to excite, to make haste (after which also Saad. and Aben-Ezra: on account of my inward hastening or urging), but with Arab. h&#803;s, to feel; in this meaning chsh is usual in all the Semitic dialects, and is even biblical also; for <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-25.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:25</a> is to be translated: who hath feeling (pleasure) except from Him (read &#1502;&#1502;&#1504;&#1493;)? i.e., even in pleasure man is not free, but has conditions fixed by God.<p>With &#1500;&#1499;&#1503; (used as in <a href="/job/42-3.htm">Job 42:3</a>) Zophar draws an inference from Job's conduct, esp. from the turn which his last speech has taken, which, as &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1513;&#1474;&#1506;&#1497;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;<p>(Note: Thus it is to be read according to the Masoretic note, &#1493;&#1502;&#1500;&#1488; &#1500;&#1497;&#1514; (i.e., plene, as nowhere else), which occurs in Codd., as is also attested by Kimchi in his Gramm., Moznajim, p. 8; Aben-Ezra in his Gramm., Zachoth 1, b; and the punctuator Jekuthil, in his Darche ha-Nikkud (chapter on the letters &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1488;).)<p>affirms, urges him involuntarily and irresistibly forward, and indeed, as he adds with Waw explic.: on account of the power of feeling dwelling in him, by which he means both his sense of truth and his moral feeling, in general the capacity of direct perception, not perception that is only attained after long reflection.
