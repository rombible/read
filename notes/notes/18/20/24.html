There is no fence against this, but in Christ, who is the only Covert from the storm and tempest, Isa 32:2. Zophar concludes, This is the portion of a wicked man from God; it is allotted him. Never was any doctrine better explained, or worse applied, than this by Zophar, who intended to prove Job a hypocrite. Let us receive the good explanation, and make a better application, for warning to ourselves, to stand in awe and sin not. One view of Jesus, directed by the Holy Spirit, and by him suitably impressed upon our souls, will quell a thousand carnal reasonings about the suffering of the faithful.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>To the works cast up by a besieging army for the annoyance of a city by their weapons of war:<p>His troops advanced together against me;<p>They throw up their way against me,<p>And they encamp round about my dwelling. <a href="/job/19-12.htm">Job 19:12</a>.<p>In this connection, also, should be mentioned the sublime description of the war-horse in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/39-19.htm">Job 39:19</a>, following The horse was undoubtedly used in war and a more sublime description of this animal caparisoned for battle, impatient for the contest, does not occur in any language:<p>Hast thou given the horse his strength?<p>Hast thou clothed his neck with thunder?<p>Dost thou make him to leap as the locust?<p>How terrible is the glory of his nostrils!<p>He paweth in the valley; he exulteth in his strength;<p>He goeth forth into the midst of arms.<p>He laugheth at fear, and is nothing daunted;<p>And he turneth not back from the sword.<p>Upon him rattleth the quiver;<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/20.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24. steel&#8212;rather, "brass."

The sword, for fear of being thrust through with it; the flaming sword of justice God sometimes threatens to take, and whet, and make use of against ungodly men; the sword of God, as Bar Tzemach observes, is hereby figuratively expressed; fleeing from it, or an attempt to flee from it, shows guilt in the conscience, danger, and a sense of it, and a fear of falling into it, and yet there is no escaping the hand of God, or fleeing from his presence: <p>and the bow of steel shall strike him through; that is, an arrow out of a bow, made of steel or brass, of which bows were formerly made, and reckoned the strongest and most forcible, see <a href="/psalms/18-34.htm">Psalm 18:34</a>; signifying, that if he should escape the dint of a weapon, a sword or spear used near at hand, yet, as he fled, he would be reached by one that strikes at a distance, an arrow shot from a bow; the sense is, that, if a wicked man escapes one judgment, another will be sure to follow him, and overtake him and destroy him, see <a href="/isaiah/24-17.htm">Isaiah 24:17</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/20.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">He shall flee from the iron weapon, and the bow of steel shall strike him through.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/job/20.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">24</span>.

This is no indication of the late authorship of Job. Iron was in use in Egypt at a very early date. A thin plate of it was found by Colonel Howard Vyse embedded in the masonry of the great pyramid; and iron implements and ornaments, iron spear-heads, iron sickles, iron gimlets, iron keys, iron bracelets, iron wire, have been found in the early tombs not infrequently (see the author's 'History of Ancient  Egypt,' vol. 1. p. 505). That they are not more common is accounted for by the rapid oxidization of iron by exposure to the air, and its rapid decay in the nitrous soil of Egypt. The inhabitants of South-Western Asia were at no time much behind the Egyptians in their knowledge of the useful arts: and iron appears as a well-known metal in the Jewish Scriptures from the time of the Exodus (see <a href="/numbers/35-16.htm">Numbers 35:16</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/3-11.htm">Deuteronomy 3:11</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/4-20.htm">Deuteronomy 4:20</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/8-9.htm">Deuteronomy 8:9</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/28-23.htm">Deuteronomy 28:23</a>; <a href="/joshua/8-31.htm">Joshua 8:31</a>). It is true that the principal weapons of war continued to be made ordinarily of bronze, both in South-Western Asia and in Egypt, till a comparatively late period; but Zophar may mean to assign to the slayer of the wicked man weapons of a superior character. <span class="cmt_word">And the bow of steel shall strike him through</span>. It is uncertain whether steel was known in the ancient world. But, whether or no, "steel" is not meant here. The word used in the original is <span class="accented">nehushtah</span>, which undoubtedly means either "copper" or "bronze." As copper would be too soft a material for a bow, we may assume bronze to be intended. The bronze used in Egypt was extremely elastic, and there would have been little difficulty in fashioning bows of it (on the existence of such bows, see 2 Samuel 26:5; <a href="/psalms/18-34.htm">Psalm 18:34</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/20.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>17  He shall not delight himself in streams,<p>Like to rivers and brooks of honey and cream.<p>18  Giving back that for which he laboured, he shall not swallow it;<p>He shall not rejoice according to the riches he hath gotten.<p>19  Because he cast down, let the destitute lie helpless;<p>He shall not, in case he hath seized a house, finish building it.<p>20  Because he knew no rest in his craving,<p>He shall not be able to rescue himself with what he most loveth.<p>As poets sing of the aurea aetas of the paradise-like primeval age: Flumina jam lactis, jam flumina nectaris ibant, <p>(Note: Ovid, Metam. i. 112, comp.
