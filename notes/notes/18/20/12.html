The lusts of the flesh are here called the sins of his youth. His hiding it and keeping it under his tongue, denotes concealment of his beloved lust, and delight therein. But He who knows what is in the heart, knows what is under the tongue, and will discover it. The love of the world, and of the wealth of it, also is wickedness, and man sets his heart upon these. Also violence and injustice, these sins bring God's judgments upon nations and families. Observe the punishment of the wicked man for these things. Sin is turned into gall, than which nothing is more bitter; it will prove to him poison; so will all unlawful gains be. In his fulness he shall be in straits, through the anxieties of his own mind. To be led by the sanctifying grace of God to restore what was unjustly gotten, as Zaccheus was, is a great mercy. But to be forced to restore by the horrors of a despairing conscience, as Judas was, has no benefit and comfort attending it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth - Though he has pleasure in committing it, as he has in pleasant food. The sense of this and the following verses is, that though a man may have pleasure in indulgence in sin, and may find happiness of a certain kind in it, yet that the consequences will be bitter - as if the food which he ate should become like gall, and he should cast it up with loathing. There are many sins which, from the laws of our nature, are attended with a kind of pleasure. Such, for illustration, are the sins of gluttony and of intemperance in drinking; the sins of ambition and vanity; the sins of amusement and of fashionable life. To such we give the name of "pleasures." We do not speak of them as "happiness." That is a word which would not express their nature. It denotes rather substantial, solid, permanent joy - such joy as the "pleasures of sin for a season" do not furnish. It is this temporary "pleasure" which the lovers of vanity, fashion and dress, seek, and which, it cannot be denied, they often find. As long ago as the time of Zophar, it was admitted that such pleasure might be found in some forms of sinful indulgence and yet even in his time that was seen, which all subsequent observation has proved true, that such indulgence must lead to bitter results.<p>Though he hide it under his tongue - It is from this passage, probably, that we have derived the phrase, "to roll sin as a sweet morsel under the tongue," which is often quoted as if it were a part of Scripture. The "meaning" here is, that a man would find pleasure in sin, and would seek to prolong it, as one does the pleasure of eating that which is grateful to the palate by holding it long in the mouth, or by placing it under the tongue. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/20.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. be&#8212;"taste sweet."

Which may respect some particular sin, and by the context it seems to be the sin of covetousness, or of getting riches in an unlawful way, which is very sweet and pleasing to wicked men, while they are in such pursuits that succeed; and so Mr. Broughton renders it by "wrong"; though it may be applied to sin in general, which is "wickedness", or an evil (q), being contrary to the pure and holy nature, will, and law of God; and it is evil in its effects on men, it having deprived them of the image and glory of God, and exposed them to his wrath, to the curses of his law, and to eternal deaths. Now this is "sweet" to an unregenerate man, who minds and savours the things of the flesh, whose taste is not changed, but is as it was from his birth, and who calls sweet bitter, and bitter sweet; such a man has the same delight in sin as a man has in his food, drinks up iniquity like water, and commits sin with greediness; for it is natural to him, he is conceived, born, and brought up in it; besides, some sins are what are more particularly called constitution sins, which some are peculiarly addicted to, and in which they take a peculiar delight and pleasure; these are like the right hand or right eye, and they cannot be persuaded, at any rate, to part with them: <p>though he hide it under his tongue; not for the sake of concealing it, nor by denying, dissembling, or excusing it, but for the sake of enjoying more pleasure in it; as a gluttonous man, when he has got a sweet morsel in his mouth, do not let it go down his throat immediately, but rolls it under his tongue, that he may have all the pleasure of it he can; so a wicked man devises sin in his heart, keeps it on his mind, revolves it in his thoughts, and his meditation on it is sweet; and he is so far from hiding it from others, that he openly declares it, freely tells of it, and takes pleasure in so doing: "fools make a mock at sin"; it is their diversion and recreation. <p>(q) "malum", Pagninus, Montanus, Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator, &amp;c. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/20.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Though wickedness be <span class="cverse3">{f}</span> sweet in his mouth, <i>though</i> he hide it under his tongue;</span><p>(f) As poison that is sweet in the mouth brings destruction when it comes into the body: so all vice at the first is pleasant, but God later turns it to destruction.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/job/20.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">12</span>.

It is, perhaps, the most surprising among the phenomena of wickedness that men can gloat over it, voluntarily recur to it, make a boast of it, recount signal instances of it to their friends, and seem to find a satisfaction in the recollection. One would have expected that shame and self-disapproval and fear of retribution would have led them to dismiss their wicked acts from their thoughts as soon as possible. But certainly the fact is otherwise. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/20.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>  6  If his aspiration riseth to the heavens,<p>And he causeth his head to touch the clouds:<p>  7  Like his dung he perisheth for ever;<p>Those who see him say: Where is he?<p>  8  As a dream he flieth away, and they cannot find him;<p>And he is scared away as a vision of the night.<p>  9  The eye hath seen him, and never again,<p>And his place beholdeth him no more.<p>10  His children must appease the poor,<p>And his hands give up his wealth.<p>11  His bones were full of youthful vigour;<p>Now it is laid down with him in the dust.<p>If the exaltation of the evil-doer rises to heaven, and he causes his head to reach to the clouds, i.e., to touch the clouds, he notwithstanding perishes like his own dung.

It is unnecessary, with Ew., Hirz., and Hlgst., after Schultens, to transl. &#1499;&#1490;&#1500;&#1500;&#1493;, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/20-7.htm">Job 20:7</a>, according to the Arab. jla&#770;l (whence the name Gell-ed-dn): secundum majestatem suam, or with Reiske to read &#1489;&#1490;&#1500;&#1500;&#1493;, in magnificentia sua, and it is very hazardous, since the Hebrew &#1490;&#1500;&#1500; has not the meaning of Arab. jll, illustrem esse. Even Schultens, in his Commentary, has retracted the explanation commended in his Animadv., and maintained the correctness of the translation, sicut stercus suum (Jer. sicut sterquilinium), which is also favoured by the similar figurative words in <a href="/1_kings/14-10.htm">1 Kings 14:10</a> : as one burneth up (not: brushes away) dung (&#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1500;), probably cow-dung as fuel, until it is completely gone. &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1500;&#1493; (or &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1500;&#1493; with an audible Shev) may be derived from &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1500;, but the analogy of &#1510;&#1500;&#1500;&#1493; favours the primary form &#1490;&#1468;&#1500; (Ew. 255, b); on no account is it &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1500;. The word is not low, as <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-12.htm">Ezekiel 4:12</a>, comp. <a href="//biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-17.htm">Zephaniah 1:17</a>, shows, and the figure, though revolting, is still very expressive; and how the fulfilment is to be thought of may be seen from an example from <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/9-37.htm">2 Kings 9:37</a>, according to which, "as dung upon the face of the field shall it be, so that they cannot say: this is Jezebel." <p>(Note: In Arabic, gille (&#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;) and gelle (&#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;) is the usual and preferred fuel (hence used as synon. of hhattab) formed of the dung of cows, and not indeed yoke-oxen (baqar 'ammle), because they have more solid fodder, which produces no material for the gelle, but from cattle that pasture in the open fields (baqar bat.tle), which are almost entirely milking cows. This dung is collected by women and children in the spring from the pastures as perfectly dry cakes, which have the green colour of the grass. Every husbandman knows that this kind of dung - the product of a rapid, one might say merely half, digestion, even when fresh, but especially when dry - is perfectly free from smell. What is collected is brought in baskets to the forming or pressing place (mattba'a, &#1502;&#1496;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492;), where it is crumbled, then with water made into a thick mass, and, having been mixed with chopped straw, is formed by the women with the hand into round cakes, about a span across, and three fingers thick. They resemble the tanners' tan-cakes, only they are not square. Since this compound has the form of a loaf it is called qurss (which also signifies a loaf of bread); and since a definite form is given to it by the hand, it is called ttabu' (&#1496;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;), collective ttbbi', which &#1510;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497; (&#1510;&#1508;&#1497;&#1506;&#1497;), <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-15.htm">Ezekiel 4:15</a>, resembles in meaning; for ssaf', &#1510;&#1508;&#1506; (cogn. ssafhh, &#1510;&#1508;&#1495;), signifies to beat anything with the palm of the hand. First spread out, then later on piled up, the gelle lies the whole summer in the mattba'a. The domes (qubeb) are not formed until a month before the rainy season, i.e., a circular structure is built up of the cakes skilfully placed one upon another like bricks; it is made from six to eight yards high, gradually narrowed and finished with a vaulted dome, whence this structure has its name, qubbe (&#1511;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492;). Below it measures about eight or ten paces, it is always hollow, and is filled from beneath by means of an opening which serves as a door. The outside of the qubbe is plastered over with a thick solution of dung; and this coating, when once dried in the sun, entirely protects the building, which is both storehouse and store, against the winter rains. When they begin to use the fuel, they take from the inside first by means of the doorway, and afterwards (by which time the heavy rains are over) they use up the building itself, removing the upper part first by means of a ladder. By the summer the qubbe has disappeared. Many large households have three or four of these stores. Where walled-in courts are spacious, as is generally the case, they stand within; where not, outside. The communities bordering on the desert, and exposed to attacks from the Arabs, place them close round their villages, which gives them a peculiar appearance. When attacked, the herds are driven behind these buildings, and the peasants make their appearance between them with their javelins. Seetzen reckons the gelle among the seven characteristics of the district of Haurn (Basan).<p>continued...</body></html>
