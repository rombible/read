Though impenitent sinners do not always fall under such temporal judgments as are here described, and in that Zophar was mistaken; yet the wrath of God abides upon them: and they are made miserable by spiritual judgments, which are much worse; their consciences being either, on the one hand, a terror to them, and then they are in continual amazement; or, on the other hand, seared and silenced, and then they are given up to a reprobate mind, and bound over to eternal ruin. “Never was any doctrine better explained,” says Henry, “nor worse applied, than this here by Zophar: who intended by all this to prove Job to be a hypocrite.

There is no fence against this, but in Christ, who is the only Covert from the storm and tempest, Isa 32:2. Zophar concludes, This is the portion of a wicked man from God; it is allotted him. Never was any doctrine better explained, or worse applied, than this by Zophar, who intended to prove Job a hypocrite. Let us receive the good explanation, and make a better application, for warning to ourselves, to stand in awe and sin not.

Zophar intended, undoubtedly, that Job should apply it to himself, and that he should draw the inference, that one who had been treated in this manner, must be a wicked man.<p>And the heritage appointed - Margin, "of his decree from." The Hebrew is," Of his word" (&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;  'e&#770;mero&#770; ) - that is, of his "purpose." The idea is, that this is the divine rule, or arrangement. It is not a matter of chance. It is the result of appointment, and when people are afflicted in this manner, we are to conclude that "God" regards them as guilty. The whole object of the discussion was to arrive at the principles of the divine administration. Nothing is attributed to chance; and nothing is ascribed to second causes, except as indicating the will of God. It is assumed, that the course of events in the world was a sufficient exponent of the divine intention, and that when they understood how God "treated" a man, they could clearly understand how he regarded his character. The principle is a good one, when "the whole of existence" is taken into the account; the fault here was in taking in only a small part of existence - this short life - and hastening to the conclusion, that the character could be certainly determined by the manner in which God deals with people here. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/20.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>29. appointed&#8212;not as a matter of chance, but by the divine "decree" (Margin) and settled principle.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/job/20.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">From God; </span> who like a wise master of a feast gives to every man his proper portion, and as a just judge distributes to him according to his deserts. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The heritage appointed unto him by God, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">the heritage</span> (i.e. the portion, as before; called here a heritage; partly to note the stability and assurance of it, that it is as firm as an inheritance to the right heir; and partly in opposition to that inheritance which he had gotten by fraud and violence) <span class="ital">of his word</span>; either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

Some choose to render the clause, "and the inheritance of his word or words (i) is unto him by God"; that is, punishment shall be inflicted upon him, and continue with him as an inheritance, because of his words, his indecent words, hard speeches and blasphemies uttered by him; referring, as it is thought, to the words which had dropped from the lips of Job. <p>(i)  "haereditas eloquii ejus", Pagninus, Montanus; "verborum ejus", V.

Like all the speakers in this second round of debate Zophar concludes by pointing with an impressive gesture to the picture he has drawn. Job should see himself there. He finishes by saying “from God.” This forces Job into the arena; he has no help, however unwilling he may be, but face this argument (ch. <a href="/job/21-27.htm" title="Behold, I know your thoughts, and the devices which you wrongfully imagine against me.">Job 21:27</a>), and he shews that that which comes “from God” (ch. <a href="/job/21-22.htm" title="Shall any teach God knowledge? seeing he judges those that are high.">Job 21:22</a>) is something very different.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This is the portion of a wicked man from God</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the lot, or <span class="accented">possession of a wicked man -</span> that which God makes over to him as his own in the last resort, and which is all that he has to look for.

The form of inflection &#1500;&#1495;&#1502;&#1468;&#1501; is referable to &#1500;&#1495;&#1501; after the form &#1500;&#1488;&#1501;.)<p>A suitable thought is obtained if &#1500;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; is taken in the signification, food: He will rain upon him his food, i.e., what is fit for him (with Beth of the instrument instead of the accusative of the object), or: He will rain down (His wrath) upon him as his food (with Beth essent., according to which Ew.: what can satisfy him; Bridel: pour son aliment; Renan: en guise de pain); but we give the preference to the other interpretation, because it is at once natural in this book, abounding in Arabisms, to suppose for &#1500;&#1495;&#1493;&#1501; the signification of the Arab. lah&#803;m, which is also supported in Hebrew by <a href="/zephaniah/1-17.htm">Zephaniah 1:17</a>; further, because the Targ. favours it, which transl. &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1491;&#1497;&#1492;&#1468;, and expositors, as Aben-Ezra and Ralbag, who interpret by &#1489;&#1489;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1493;; finally, because it gives an appropriate idea, to which <a href="/lamentations/1-13.htm">Lamentations 1:13</a> presents a commendable parallel, comp. also <a href="//biblehub.com/james/5-3.htm">James 5:3</a>, and Koran, Sur. 2, 169: "those who hide what God has sent down by the Scripture, and thereby obtain a small profit, eat only fire into their belly." That &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1502;&#1493; can be used pathetically for &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; is unmistakeably clear from <a href="//biblehub.com/job/22-2.htm">Job 22:2</a>, comp. <a href="//biblehub.com/job/27-23.htm">Job 27:23</a>, and on <a href="/psalms/11-7.htm">Psalm 11:7</a>; the morally indignant speech which threatens punishment, intentionally seeks after rare solemn words and darksome tones. Therefore: Upon his flesh, which has been nourished in unsympathizing greediness, God rains down, i.e., rain of fire, which scorches it. This is the hidden background of the lot of punishment, the active principle of which, though it be effected by human agency, is the punitive power of the fire of divine wrath. <a href="/job/20-24.htm">Job 20:24</a> describe, by illustration, how it is worked out. The evil-doer flees from a hostile superior power, is hit in the back by the enemy's arrows; and since he, one who is overthrown, seeks to get free from them, he is made to feel the terrors of inevitably approaching death.</body></html>
