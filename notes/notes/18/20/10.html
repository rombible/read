The lusts of the flesh are here called the sins of his youth. His hiding it and keeping it under his tongue, denotes concealment of his beloved lust, and delight therein. But He who knows what is in the heart, knows what is under the tongue, and will discover it. The love of the world, and of the wealth of it, also is wickedness, and man sets his heart upon these. Also violence and injustice, these sins bring God's judgments upon nations and families. Observe the punishment of the wicked man for these things. Sin is turned into gall, than which nothing is more bitter; it will prove to him poison; so will all unlawful gains be. In his fulness he shall be in straits, through the anxieties of his own mind. To be led by the sanctifying grace of God to restore what was unjustly gotten, as Zaccheus was, is a great mercy.

The idea in the Hebrew seems to be, that his sons shall be reduced to the humiliating condition of asking the aid of the most needy and abject. Instead of being in a situation to assist others, and to indulge in a liberal hospitality, they themselves shall be reduced to the necessity of applying to the poor for the means of subsistence. There is great strength in this expression. It is usually regarded as humiliating to be compelled to ask aid at all; but the idea here is, that they would be reduced to the necessity of asking it of those who themselves needed it, "or would be beggars of beggars."<p>And his hands shall restore their goods - Noyes renders this, "And their hands shall give back his wealth." Rosenmuller supposes it means, "And their hands shall restore his iniquity;" that is, what their father took unjustly away. There can be but little doubt that this refers to his "sons," and not to himself - though the singular suffix in the word (&#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1493;  ya&#770;da&#772;y&#770;), "his hands" is used. But the singular is sometimes used instead of the plural. The word rendered "goods" (&#1488;&#1493;&#1503;  'o&#770;n), means "strength, power, and then wealth;" and the idea here is, that the hands of his sons would be compelled to give back the property which the father had unjustly acquired. Instead of retaining and enjoying it, they would be compelled to make restitution, and thus be reduced to penury and want. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/20.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. seek to please&#8212;"Atone to the poor" (by restoring the property of which they had been robbed by the father) [De Wette].

In this and some following verses the miserable state of a wicked man is described, and which begins with his children, who are often visited in wrath for their parents' sins, especially when they tread in their steps, and follow their example; and it is an affliction to parents to see their children in distress, and particularly on their account, and even to be threatened with it. According to our version, the sense of this clause is, that after a wicked man's death his children shall seek to gain the good will and favour of the poor who have been oppressed by him, that they may not reproach them, or take revenge on them, or apply to the civil magistrate to have justice done them; but Jarchi renders the words, <p>"the poor shall oppress or destroy his children;'' <p>and so the margin of our Bible, who, being enraged with the ill usage of their parents, shall fall upon them in great wrath, and destroy them, <a href="/proverbs/28-3.htm">Proverbs 28:3</a>; and the same Jewish writer restrains the words to the men of Sodom, who were oppressive and cruel to the poor; or rather the sense is, that the children of the wicked man shall be reduced to such extreme poverty, that they shall even seek relief of the poor, and supplicate and entreat them to give them something out of their small pittance; with which others in a good measure agree, who render the words, "his children shall please, being poor" (n); it shall be a pleasure and satisfaction to those they have been injurious to, to see their children begging their bread from door to door, see <a href="/psalms/109-5.htm">Psalm 109:5</a>; <p>and his hands shall restore their goods: or "for his hands", &amp;c. (o); and so are a reason why his children shall be so reduced after his death as to need the relief of others, because their parent, in his lifetime, was obliged to make restitution of his ill gotten goods, so that in the end he had nothing to leave his children at his death; for this restitution spoken of is not voluntary, but forced. Sephorno thinks reference is had to the Egyptians lending jewels and other riches to the Israelites, whereby they were obliged to repay six hundred thousand men for their service. <p>(n)   "filii ejus placabunt, mendici", Montanus.

But the translation of the Authorized Version seems preferable. His children will curry favour with the poor, either by making restitution to them on account of their father's injuries, or simply because they are friendless, and desire to ingratiate themselves with some one. <span class="cmt_word">And his hands shall restore their goods</span> (comp. vers. 15 and 18).

Ewald observes: "&#1489;&#1506;&#1489;&#1493;&#1512; stands without addition, because this is easily understood from the &#1499;&#1503; in &#1500;&#1499;&#1503;." But although this ellipsis is not inadmissible (comp. &#1500;&#1499;&#1503;  equals  &#1500;&#1499;&#1503; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, <a href="/job/34-25.htm">Job 34:25</a>; &#1499;&#1506;&#1500;, <a href="/isaiah/59-18.htm">Isaiah 59:18</a>), in spite of it <a href="/job/20-2.htm">Job 20:2</a> furnishes no meaning that can be accepted. Most expositors translate: "and hence the storm within me" (thus e.g., Ewald); but the signification perturbatio animi, proposed by Schultens for &#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;, after the Arab. h&#803;a&#770;s&#780;, is too remote from the usage of Hebrew. Moreover, this Arab. h&#803;a&#770;s&#780; signifies prop. to scare, hunt, of game; not, however: to be agitated, to storm, - a signification which even the corresponding Hebr. &#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;, properare, does not support. Only a few expositors (as Umbreit, who translates: because of my storm within me) take &#1489;&#1506;&#1489;&#1493;&#1512; (which occurs only this once in the book of Job) as praepos., as it must be taken in consideration of the infin. which follows (comp. <a href="/exodus/9-16.htm">Exodus 9:16</a>; <a href="/exodus/20-20.htm">Exodus 20:20</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/1-6.htm">1 Samuel 1:6</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/10-3.htm">2 Samuel 10:3</a>). Further, &#1500;&#1499;&#1503; (only by Umbreit translated by "yet," after the Arab. la&#770;kin, la&#770;kinna, which it never signifies in Hebr., where &#1500; is not  equals  &#1500;&#1488;, but  equals  &#1500; with Kametz before the tone) with that which follows is referred by several expositors to the preceding speech of Job, e.g., Hahn: "under such circumstances, if thou behavest thus;" by most, however, it is referred to <a href="//biblehub.com/job/20-3.htm">Job 20:3</a>, e.g., Ew.: "On this account he feels called upon by his thoughts to answer, and hence his inward impulse leaves him no rest: because he hears from Job a contemptuous wounding reproof of himself." In other words: in consequence of the reproach which Job casts upon him, especially with his threat of judgment, Zophar's mind and feelings fall into a state of excitement, and give him an answer to which he now gives utterance. This prospective sense of &#1500;&#1499;&#1503; may at any rate be retained, though &#1489;&#1506;&#1489;&#1493;&#1512; is taken as a preposition (wherefore ... and indeed on account of my inward commotion); but it is far more natural that the beginning of Zophar's speech should be connected with the last word of Job's. <a href="/job/20-2.htm">Job 20:2</a> may really be so understood if we connect &#1495;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;, not with Arab. h&#803;a&#770;s&#780;, &#1495;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;, to excite, to make haste (after which also Saad. and Aben-Ezra: on account of my inward hastening or urging), but with Arab. h&#803;s, to feel; in this meaning chsh is usual in all the Semitic dialects, and is even biblical also; for <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-25.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:25</a> is to be translated: who hath feeling (pleasure) except from Him (read &#1502;&#1502;&#1504;&#1493;)? i.e., even in pleasure man is not free, but has conditions fixed by God.<p>With &#1500;&#1499;&#1503; (used as in <a href="/job/42-3.htm">Job 42:3</a>) Zophar draws an inference from Job's conduct, esp. from the turn which his last speech has taken, which, as &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1513;&#1474;&#1506;&#1497;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;<p>(Note: Thus it is to be read according to the Masoretic note, &#1493;&#1502;&#1500;&#1488; &#1500;&#1497;&#1514; (i.e., plene, as nowhere else), which occurs in Codd., as is also attested by Kimchi in his Gramm., Moznajim, p. 8; Aben-Ezra in his Gramm., Zachoth 1, b; and the punctuator Jekuthil, in his Darche ha-Nikkud (chapter on the letters &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1488;).)<p>affirms, urges him involuntarily and irresistibly forward, and indeed, as he adds with Waw explic.: on account of the power of feeling dwelling in him, by which he means both his sense of truth and his moral feeling, in general the capacity of direct perception, not perception that is only attained after long reflection.
