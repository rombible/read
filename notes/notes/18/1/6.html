(Comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/11-10.htm" title="For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels.">1Corinthians 11:10</a>.) In the latter sense, a solemn thought is suggested by it to those who join in the public worship of God.<p><span class= "bld">Satan.</span>—The word appears in the Old Testament as the name of a specific person only here and in <a href="/zechariah/3-2.htm" title="And the LORD said to Satan, The LORD rebuke you, O Satan; even the LORD that has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you: is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?">Zechariah 3:2</a>, and possibly in <a href="/1_chronicles/21-1.htm" title="And Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to number Israel.">1Chronicles 21:1</a> and <a href="/psalms/109-6.htm" title="Set you a wicked man over him: and let Satan stand at his right hand.">Psalm 109:6</a>. If this psalm is David’s, according to the inscription, no reliance can be placed on speculations as to the late introduction of a belief in Satan among the Jews, nor, therefore, on any as to the lateness of these early chapters of Job. Precisely the same word is used, apparently as a common name, in the history of Balaam (<a href="/numbers/22-22.htm" title="And God's anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of the LORD stood in the way for an adversary against him.

Here only and in Zechariah it is found with the definite article “the adversary.” The theory of the personality of the evil one must largely depend upon the view we take of these and other passages of Scripture as containing an authoritative revelation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/job/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/job/1-6.htm" title="Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them.">Job 1:6</a></span>. <span class="ital">Now there was a day — </span>A certain time appointed by God; <span class="ital">when the sons of God came — </span>The Targum says, <span class="ital">Troops of angels, </span>the LXX., <span class="ital">Angels of God; </span>the holy angels are called sons of God, (<a href="/job/38-7.htm" title="When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?">Job 38:7</a>, and <a href="/daniel/3-25.htm" title="He answered and said, See, I see four men loose, walking in the middle of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.">Daniel 3:25</a>; <a href="/daniel/3-28.htm" title="Then Nebuchadnezzar spoke, and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who has sent his angel, and delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the king's word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God.">Daniel 3:28</a>,) because of their creation by God, their resemblance of him in power, dignity, and holiness, and their filial affection and obedience to him. <span class="ital">To present themselves before the Lord — </span>Before his throne, to receive his commands, and to give him an account of their ministrations. The verb <span class="greekheb">להתיצב</span>, <span class="ital">lehithjatseb, </span>here rendered <span class="ital">to present themselves, </span>expresses the attendance and assiduity of ministers appearing before their king to receive his instructions, or give an account of their negotiations. This must be understood as a parabolical representation, similar to that in <a href="/1_kings/22-19.htm" title="And he said, Hear you therefore the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left.">1 Kings 22:19</a>. The Scripture speaks of God after the manner of men, condescending to our capacities, and suiting the revelation to our apprehensions. As kings, therefore, transact their most important affairs in a solemn council or assembly, so God is pleased to represent himself as having his council likewise and as passing the decrees of his providence in an assembly of his holy angels. We have here, in the case of Job, the same grand assembly held as was before in that of Ahab, 1 Kings 22 : the same host of heaven, called here the <span class="ital">sons of God, </span>presenting themselves before Jehovah, as in the vision of Micaiah they are said to stand <span class="ital">on his right hand and on his left: </span>a wicked spirit appearing among them, here called <span class="ital">Satan, </span>or <span class="ital">the adversary, </span>and there <span class="ital">a lying spirit, </span>both bent on mischief, and ready to do all the hurt that they were able, as far as God would give them leave; but, nevertheless, both under the control of his power, and suffered to go as far as might best serve the wise ends of his justice and his providence, and no further. The imagery, in short, is just the same; and the only difference is in the manner of the relation. Micaiah, as a prophet, and in the actual exercise of his prophetic office, delivers it as he received it, that is, in a <span class="ital">vision: I saw the Lord sitting on his throne, </span>&c. The other, as an historian, interweaves it with the history, and tells us, in the plain narrative style, <span class="ital">There was a day, </span>&c. And this parabolical or prophetical way of representing what is a great and most important truth, namely, that God, by his wise and holy providence, governs all the actions of men and devils, is used that it may make a more lively and lasting impression on our minds. At the same time it must not be forgotten that representations of this kind are founded in a well-known and established truth, namely, that there are angels, both good and bad, that they are interested in the affairs of men; a point revealed, no doubt, from the beginning. And that the affairs of earth are much the subject of the counsels of the unseen world, to which we lie open, though that world is in a great measure concealed from us. And such representations may also be intended to discover to us, in part, at least, the causes of many of those things which happen on earth, and which appear to us unaccountable, namely, that they arise from our having some connection with, or relation to, other orders of beings through the universe, on whose account, and through whose ministry, many things may happen to us, which otherwise would not. Thus the dreadful calamities and afflictions which befell Job, in such quick succession, are utterly unaccountable according to the ordinary course of human things, and seem almost without reason, if he were considered merely as a human being, having no connection with, relation to, or influence upon, any world but this, or any order of beings but those among whom he lived; but are easily accounted for if brought on him by invisible agents, through divine permission, and certainly answered a most wise and grand purpose, if intended to show to superior beings, whether good or evil, to what a degree of steady and invincible piety and fidelity to God his grace can raise creatures formed out of the clay, and dwelling in flesh. It is but just to observe here, that some commentators adopt a different interpretation of this verse, understanding by <span class="ital">the sons of God presenting themselves before the Lord, </span>the people of God meeting together for religious worship on earth. Dr. Lightfoot’s comment is, “On a sabbath day, when the professors of the true religion were met together, in the public assembly, Satan was invisibly there among them;” namely, to distract and disturb them in their worship, and observe their infirmities and defects, that he might have matter of accusation against them. But what we have stated above seems to be the most probable sense of the passage.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/job/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:6-12 Job's afflictions began from the malice of Satan, by the Lord's permission, for wise and holy purposes. There is an evil spirit, the enemy of God, and of all righteousness, who is continually seeking to distress, to lead astray, and, if possible, to destroy those who love God. How far his influence may extend, we cannot say; but probably much unsteadiness and unhappiness in Christians may be ascribed to him. While we are on this earth we are within his reach. Hence it concerns us to be sober and vigilant, 1Pe 5:8. See how Satan censures Job. This is the common way of slanderers, to suggest that which they have no reason to think is true. But as there is nothing we should dread more than really being hypocrites, so there is nothing we need dread less than being called and counted so without cause. It is not wrong to look at the eternal recompence in our obedience; but it is wrong to aim at worldly advantages in our religion. God's people are taken under his special protection; they, and all that belong to them. The blessing of the Lord makes rich; Satan himself owns it. God suffered Job to be tried, as he suffered Peter to be sifted. It is our comfort that God has the devil in a chain, Re 20:1. He has no power to lead men to sin, but what they give him themselves; nor any power to afflict men, but what is given him from above. All this is here described to us after the manner of men. The Scripture speaks thus to teach us that God directs the affairs of the world.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Now there was a day - Dr. Good renders this, "And the day came." Tindal." Now upon a time." The Chaldee paraphrasist has presumed to specify the time, and renders it, "Now it happened in the day of judgment (or scrutiny, &#1491;&#1491;&#1497;&#1504;&#1488; &#1489;&#1497;&#1493;&#1502;&#1488;), "in the beginning of the year," that hosts of angels came to stand in judgment before yahweh, and Satan came." According to this, the judgment occurred once a year, and a solemn investigation was had of the conduct even of the angels. In the Hebrew there is no intimation of the frequency with which this occurred, nor of the time of the year when it happened. The only idea is, that "the sons of God" on a set or appointed day came to stand before God to give an account of what they had done, and to receive further orders in regard to what they were to do. - This is evidently designed to introduce the subsequent events relating to Job. It is language taken from the proceedings of a monarch who had sent forth messengers or ambassadors on important errands through the different provinces of his empire, who now returned to give an account of what they had observed, and of the general state of the kingdom. Such a return would, of course, be made on a fixed day when, in the language of the law, their report would be "returnable," and when they would be required to give in an account of the state of the kingdom. If it be said that it is inconsistent with the supposition that this book was inspired to suppose such a poetic fiction, Ireply,<p>(1) That it is no more so than the parables of the Savior, who often supposes cases, and states them as real occurrences, in order to illustrate some important truth. Yet no one was ever led into error by this.<p>(2) It is in accordance with the language in the Scripture everywhere to describe God as a monarch seated on his throne, surrounded by his ministers, and sending them forth to accomplish important purposes in different parts of his vast empire.<p>It is not absolutely necessary, therefore, to regard this as designed to represent an actual occurrence. It is one of the admissible ornaments of poetry; - as admissible as any other poetic ornament. To represent God as a king is not improper; and if so, it is not improper to represent him with the usual accompaniments of royalty, - surrounded by ministers, and employing angels and messengers for important purposes in his kingdom. This supposition being admitted, all that follows is merely in "keeping," and is designed to preserve the verisimilitude of the conception. - This idea, however, by no means militates against the supposition that angels are in fact really employed by God in important purposes in the government of his kingdom, nor that Satan has a real existence, and is permitted by God to employ an important agency in the accomplishment of his purposes toward his people. On this verse, however, see the Introduction, Section 1, (4).<p>The sons of God - Angels; compare <a href="/job/38-7.htm">Job 38:7</a>. The whole narrative supposes that they were celestial beings.<p>Came to present themselves - As having returned from their embassy, and to give an account of what they had observed and done.<p>Before the Lord - Before &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; yehova&#770;h. On the meaning of this word, see the notes at <a href="/isaiah/1-2.htm">Isaiah 1:2</a>. A scene remarkably similar to this is described in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/22-19.htm">1 Kings 22:19-23</a>. Yahweh is there represented as "sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left." He inquires who would go and persuade Ahab that he might go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead? "And there came forth a spirit and stood before the Lord, and said, I will persuade him." This he promised to do by being "a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets."<p>And Satan came also among them - Margin, "The adversary" came "in the midst of them." On the general meaning of this passage, and the reasons why Satan is introduced here, and the argument thence derived respecting the age and authorship of the book of Job, see the Introduction, Section 4, (4). The Vulgate renders this by the name "Satan." The Septuagint: &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; ho diabolos - the devil, or the accuser. The Chaldee, &#1505;&#1496;&#1504;&#1488;  sat&#803;ena&#772;', "Satan." So the Syriac. Theodotion, &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  ho antikeimenos - "the adversary." The word rendered "Satan" &#1513;&#1474;&#1496;&#1503;  s&#769;a&#770;t&#803;a&#770;n is derived from &#1513;&#1474;&#1496;&#1503;  s&#769;a&#770;t&#803;an "Satan," to lie in wait, to be an adversary, and hence, it means properly an adversary, an accuser. It is used to denote one who "opposes," as in war <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/11-14.htm">1 Kings 11:14</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/11-23.htm">1 Kings 11:23</a>, <a href="/1_kings/11-25.htm">1 Kings 11:25</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/29-4.htm">1 Samuel 29:4</a>; onc who is an adversary or an accuser in a court of justice <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/109-6.htm">Psalm 109:6</a>, and one who stands in the way of another; <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/22-22.htm">Numbers 22:22</a>, "And the angel of yahweh stood in the way for an adversary against him" &#1500;&#1492; &#1500;&#1513;&#1474;&#1496;&#1503;  les&#769;a&#770;t&#803;a&#770;n lo&#770;h, "to oppose him."<p>It is then used by way of eminence, to denote the "adversary," and assumes the form of a proper name, and is applied to the great foe of God and man - the malignant spirit who seduces people to evil, and who accuses them before God. Thus, in <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/3-1.htm">Zechariah 3:1-2</a>, "And he showed me Joshua the priest standing before the angel of the Lord, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him. And the Loan said unto Satan, The Lord rebuke thee, O Satan;" compare <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/12-10.htm">Revelation 12:10</a>, "Now is come salvation - for the accuser &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;  ho kate&#772;goro&#772;n - that is, Satan, see <a href="/revelation/12-9.htm">Revelation 12:9</a>) of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night." - The word does not often occur in the Old Testament. It is found in the various forms of a verb and a noun in only the following places. As a verb, in the sense of being an adversary, <a href="/psalms/71-13.htm">Psalm 71:13</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/109-4.htm">Psalm 109:4</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/109-20.htm">Psalm 109:20</a>, <a href="/psalms/109-29.htm">Psalm 109:29</a>; <a href="/zechariah/3-1.htm">Zechariah 3:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/38-20.htm">Psalm 38:20</a>; as a noun, rendered "adversary" and "adversaries," <a href="/1_kings/5-4.htm">1 Kings 5:4</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/11-14.htm">1 Kings 11:14</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/11-23.htm">1 Kings 11:23</a>, <a href="/1_kings/11-25.htm">1 Kings 11:25</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/22-22.htm">Numbers 22:22</a>, <a href="/numbers/22-32.htm">Numbers 22:32</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/29-4.htm">1 Samuel 29:4</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/19-22.htm">2 Samuel 19:22</a>; rendered "Satan," <a href="/1_chronicles/21-1.htm">1 Chronicles 21:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/109-6.htm">Psalm 109:6</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/1-6.htm">Job 1:6-9</a>, <a href="/job/1-12.htm">Job 1:12</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/2-1.htm">Job 2:1-4</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/2-6.htm">Job 2:6-7</a>; <a href="/zechariah/3-2.htm">Zechariah 3:2</a>; and once rendered "an accusation," <a href="/ezra/4-6.htm">Ezra 4:6</a>.<p>It was a word, therefore, early used in the sense of an adversary or accuser, and was applied to anyone who sustained this character, until it finally came to be used as a proper name, to denote, by way of eminence, the prince of evil spirits, as the adversary or accuser of people. An opinion has been adopted in modern times by Herder, Eichhorn, Dathe, Ilgen, and some others, that the being here referred to by the name of Satan is not the malignant spirit, the enemy of God, the Devil, but is one of the sons of God, "a faithful, but too suspicious servant of yahweh." According to this, God is represented as holding a council to determine the state of his dominions. In this council, Satan, a zealous servant of yahweh, to whom had been assigned the honorable office of visiting different parts of the earth, for the purpose of observing the conduct of the subjects of yahweh, makes his appearance on his return with others.<p>Such was the piety of Job, that it had attracted the special attention of yahweh, and he puts the question to Satan, whether in his journey be had remarked this illustrious example of virtue. Satan, who, from what he has observed on earth, is supposed to have lost all confidence in the reality and genuineness of the virtue which man may exhibit, suggests that he doubts whether even Job serves God from a disinterested motive; that God had encompassed him with blessings, and that his virtue is the mere result of circumstances; and that if his comforts were removed he would be found as destitute of principle as any other man. Satan, according to this, is a suspicious minister of yahweh, not a malignant spirit; he inflicts on Job only what he is ordered to by God, and nothing because he is himself malignant. Of this opinion Gesenius remarks (Lexicon), that it "is now universally exploded."<p>An insuperable objection to this view is, that it does not accord with the character usually ascribed to Satan in the Bible, and especially that the disposition attributed to him in the narrative before us is wholly inconsistent with this view. He is a malignant being; an accuser; one delighting in the opportunity of charging a holy man with hypocrisy, and in the permission to inflict tortures on him, and who goes as far in producing misery as he is allowed - restrained from destroying him only by the express command of God. - In Arabic the word Satan is often applied to a serpent. Thus, Gjauhari, as quoted by Schultens, says, "The Arabs call a serpent Satan, especially one that is conspicuous by its crest, head, and odious appearance." It is applied also to any object or being that is evil. Thus, the Scholiast on Hariri, as quoted by Schultens also, says, "Everything that is obstinately rebellious, opposed, and removed from good, of genii, human beings, and beasts, is called Satan." - The general notion of an adversary and an opponent is found everywhere in the meaning of the word. - Dr. Good remarks on this verse, "We have here another proof that, in the system of patriarchal theology, the evil spirits, as well as the good, were equally amenable to the Almighty, and were equally cited, at definite periods, to answer for their conduct at his bar."<p>Rosenmuller remarks well on this verse, "It is to be observed, that Satan, no less than the other celestial spirits, is subject to the government of God, and dependent on his commands (compare <a href="/job/2-1.htm">Job 2:1</a>) where Satan equally with the sons of God  (&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; &#1489;&#1503;  be&#770;n 'e&#774;loh&#305;&#770;ym) is said to present himself before God (&#1500;&#1495;&#1492;&#1497;&#1510;&#1489;  leh&#305;&#770;tyatse&#772;b; that is, &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;  leitourgein), to minister. Yahweh uses the ministry of this demon (hujus daemonis) to execute punishment, or when from any other cause it seemed good to him to send evil upon men. But he, although incensed against the race of mortals, and desirous of injuring, is yet described as bound with a chain, and never dares to touch the pious unless God relaxes the reins. Satan, in walking round the earth, could certainly attentively consider Job, but to injure him he could not, unless permission had been given him." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Job 1:6-12. Satan, Appearing before God, Falsely Accuses Job.<p>6. sons of God&#8212;angels (Job 38:7; 1Ki 22:19). They present themselves to render account of their "ministry" in other parts of the universe (Heb 1:14).<p>the Lord&#8212;Hebrew, Jehovah, the self-existing God, faithful to His promises. God says (Ex 6:3) that He was not known to the patriarchs by this name. But, as the name occurs previously in Ge 2:7-9, &c., what must be meant is, not until the time of delivering Israel by Moses was He known peculiarly and publicly in the character which the name means; namely, "making things to be," fulfilling the promises made to their forefathers. This name, therefore, here, is no objection against the antiquity of the Book of Job.<p>Satan&#8212;The tradition was widely spread that he had been the agent in Adam's temptation. Hence his name is given without comment. The feeling with which he looks on Job is similar to that with which he looked on Adam in Paradise: emboldened by his success in the case of one not yet fallen, he is confident that the piety of Job, one of a fallen race, will not stand the test. He had fallen himself (Job 4:19; 15:15; Jude 6). In the Book of Job, Satan is first designated by name: "Satan," Hebrew, "one who lies in wait"; an "adversary" in a court of justice (1Ch 21:1; Ps 109:6; Zec 3:1); "accuser" (Re 12:10). He has the law of God on his side by man's sin, and against man. But Jesus Christ has fulfilled the law for us; justice is once more on man's side against Satan (Isa 42:21); and so Jesus Christ can plead as our Advocate against the adversary. "Devil" is the Greek name&#8212;the "slanderer," or "accuser." He is subject to God, who uses his ministry for chastising man. In Arabic, Satan is often applied to a serpent (Ge 3:1). He is called prince of this world (Joh 12:31); the god of this world (2Co 4:4); prince of the power of the air (Eph 2:2). God here questions him, in order to vindicate His own ways before angels.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/job/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">There was a day, </span> i.e. a certain time appointed by God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The sons of God, </span> i.e. the holy angels, so called <span class="bld"><a href="/job/38-7.htm" title="When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?">Job 38:7</a> <a href="/daniel/3-25.htm" title="He answered and said, See, I see four men loose, walking in the middle of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.">Daniel 3:25</a>,28</span>, because of their creation by God, as Adam also was, <span class="bld"><a href="/luke/3-38.htm" title="Which was the son of Enos, which was the son of Seth, which was the son of Adam, which was the son of God.">Luke 3:38</a></span>, and for their great resemblance of him in power, and dignity, and holiness, and for their filial affection and obedience to him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Before the Lord, </span> i.e. before his throne, to receive his commands, and to give him an account of their negotiations.

Levi (l) derives it from  "to decline" or "turn aside"; and so Suidas says (m), Satan, in the Hebrew language, is an apostate; and Theodoret (n) mentions both, that it signifies either an adversary or an apostate; the first derivation is best: knowing the end of the above meeting, that it was with respect to Job, and therefore he came with an intent to contradict what they should say of him, and to accuse him before God; he came among them as one of them, transforming himself into an angel of light, as he sometimes does; or he came, being sent for, and obliged to come to give an account of himself, and of what he had been doing in the world, in order to be reproved and punished: but though the stream of interpreters run this way, I cannot say I am satisfied with it; for, setting aside the passages in this book in question, angels are nowhere called "the sons of God"; for besides, this being denied of them in the sense that Christ is, they are represented as servants, yea, as servants to the sons of God, ministering spirits to the heirs of salvation; they call themselves the fellow servants of the saints, and of their brethren, but do not say that they are sons of the same family, or fellow heirs, or their brethren, <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/1-5.htm">Hebrews 1:5</a>, moreover, they always stand in the presence of God, and behold his face, be they where they will, <a href="/matthew/18-10.htm">Matthew 18:10</a> nor is there any particular day assigned them for the service of God; for though they are under the moral law, so far as it is suitable to their nature, yet not under the ceremonial law, to which the observance of days belonged; and besides, they have no rest night nor day, but continually serve God, and glorify him, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty: and if this presentation of themselves to God is supposed to be in heaven, as where else should it be? it is not possible that Satan could come among them; he is fallen from heaven, being cast down from thence, nor can he, nor ever will he, be able to find a place any more there, see <a href="/luke/10-18.htm">Luke 10:18</a> it seems better therefore to understand this of the people of God, of professors of religion, who, earlier than the times of Job, were distinguished from the men of the world by this character, "the sons of God", <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/6-2.htm">Genesis 6:2</a>, such that were truly godly being so by adopting grace, and which was made manifest by their regeneration by the Spirit of God, and by their faith in Christ, and all were so by profession: now these assembled themselves together, to present themselves, their bodies and souls, before the Lord, which was but their reasonable service; as to pray unto him, and praise him, to offer sacrifice, and perform every religious exercise enjoined in those times; the apostle uses the like phrase of the saints' social worship, <a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a> now for this there was a "day"; though I very much question whether any sabbath, or much less a seventh day sabbath, was as yet instituted; but inasmuch as men agreed together to call on the name of the Lord, or to worship him in a social way, <a href="/genesis/4-26.htm">Genesis 4:26</a> as it was necessary that a place should be appointed to meet at, so a time fixed by consent and agreement; even as now, the seventh day sabbath being abrogated, Christians agree to meet on the first day of the week, called the Lord's day, in imitation of the apostles of Christ; and on one of these days thus fixed and agreed on was the above meeting, at which Satan came among them, as he frequently does in the assembly of the saints, to do what mischief he can; by snatching away the word from inattentive hearers, and by directing the eye to such objects, and putting such things into the mind, as divert from the service of God; or by suggesting to the saints themselves, that what is attended to does not belong to them, with many other things of the like kind: the Targum interprets this day of the day of judgment, at the beginning of the year, and the sons of God of angels, as do other Jewish writers. <p>(k) Contr.

The word <span class="ital">Elohîm</span> usually means God, but this is scarcely its meaning here. The angels are not called “sons of God” as if they had actually derived their nature from Him as a child from its father; nor in a less exact way, because though created they have received a nature similar to God’s, being spirits; nor yet as if on account of their stedfast holiness they had been adopted by grace into the family of God. These ideas are not found here. The name <span class="ital">Elohim</span> or <span class="ital">sons</span> (i. e. members of the race) <span class="ital">of the Elohim</span> is a name given directly to angels in contrast with men. The word means probably “powers,” “mights,” and the name is given to God and angels in common; He is the Elohim preeminently, they are Elohim in an inferior sense. The name describes their nature or standing in contrast to what is human; the name angels, that is, messengers, is descriptive of the duties which they fulfil. The same Beings are called “sons of Elîm,” <a href="/psalms/89-6.htm" title="For who in the heaven can be compared to the LORD? who among the sons of the mighty can be likened to the LORD?">Psalm 89:6</a> (“sons of the mighty”), and <a href="/psalms/29-1.htm" title="Give to the LORD, O you mighty, give to the LORD glory and strength.">Psalm 29:1</a> (“ye mighty”), and there as here they stand in the temple or palace of the Lord, <a href="/psalms/29-9.htm" title="The voice of the LORD makes the hinds to calve, and discovers the forests: and in his temple does every one speak of his glory.">Psalm 29:9</a>; <a href="/context/psalms/89-6.htm" title="For who in the heaven can be compared to the LORD? who among the sons of the mighty can be likened to the LORD?...">Psalm 89:6-8</a>.

In <a href="/job/5-1.htm" title="Call now, if there be any that will answer you; and to which of the saints will you turn?">Job 5:1</a> the supposition is put that men might appeal to them for sympathy or a hearing amidst sufferings judged to be undeserved.

The word Satan means one who opposes another in his purpose, <a href="/numbers/22-22.htm" title="And God's anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of the LORD stood in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding on his ass, and his two servants were with him.">Numbers 22:22</a>; <a href="/numbers/22-32.htm" title="And the angel of the LORD said to him, Why have you smitten your ass these three times? behold, I went out to withstand you, because your way is perverse before me:">Numbers 22:32</a>, or pretensions and claims, <a href="/zechariah/3-1.htm" title="And he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him.">Zechariah 3:1</a>; <a href="/1_kings/11-14.htm" title="And the LORD stirred up an adversary to Solomon, Hadad the Edomite: he was of the king's seed in Edom.">1 Kings 11:14</a>; <a href="/1_kings/11-23.htm" title="And God stirred him up another adversary, Rezon the son of Eliadah, which fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah:">1 Kings 11:23</a>; <a href="/1_kings/11-25.htm" title="And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, beside the mischief that Hadad did: and he abhorred Israel, and reigned over Syria.">1 Kings 11:25</a>, or generally. The Satan is that one of God’s ministers whose part it is to oppose men in their pretensions to a right standing before God, <a href="/zechariah/3-1.htm" title="And he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him.">Zechariah 3:1</a>, and here; that is, who represents God’s trying, sifting providence. He is one of God’s messengers and presents himself before God to report, or to receive commissions, parts of God’s will which he is to execute.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>God’s providence is over all; He doeth whatsoever is done in heaven or on earth. But He makes use of agents in His operations. Hence the same act, such as instigating David to number the people, may be in one place ascribed to God directly, <a href="/2_samuel/24-1.htm" title="And again the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he moved David against them to say, Go, number Israel and Judah.">2 Samuel 24:1</a>, and in another to Satan, <a href="/1_chronicles/21-1.htm" title="And Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to number Israel.">1 Chronicles 21:1</a>. God’s purposes are usually beneficent and gracious, hence the angels are comprehensively designated as “ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for the sake of them who shall be heirs of salvation,” <a href="/hebrews/1-14.htm" title="Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?">Hebrews 1:14</a>. But He has also purposes of judgment and chastisement, which are executed by those called the “destroyers,” <a href="/job/33-22.htm" title="Yes, his soul draws near to the grave, and his life to the destroyers.">Job 33:22</a>; <a href="/exodus/12-23.htm" title="For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he sees the blood on the lintel, and on the two side posts, the LORD will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in to your houses to smite you.">Exodus 12:23</a>. In all these operations, whether of mercy or of judgment, the angels are simply servants. They do God’s behests. Their own moral character does not come into question. They are neither good nor bad angels. The spirit from the Lord that troubled Saul is called “evil,” <a href="/1_samuel/16-14.htm" title="But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD troubled him.">1 Samuel 16:14</a> <span class="ital">seq</span>., not in reference to its own character, but to the effect produced on Saul’s mind. In like manner the spirit that came forth and undertook to delude Ahab to his destruction, was not a false spirit in himself, he merely became a lying spirit in the mouth of Ahab’s prophets, <a href="/1_kings/22-19.htm" title="And he said, Hear you therefore the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left.">1 Kings 22:19</a> <span class="ital">seq</span>. In all such cases the spirit is characterized according to the influence which he exerts. Neither is the Satan represented here as a fallen or evil spirit. Yet undoubtedly a step towards this is taken. He shews an assiduity slightly too keen in the exercise of his somewhat invidious function. He rather usurps the initiative in marking out Job for trial, even though he might feel sheltered under his general commission. The Author lets us know that this is his view of him when he puts into God’s mouth the words: Thou didst set me on against him, <a href="/job/2-3.htm" title="And the LORD said to Satan, Have you considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that fears God, and eschews evil? and still he holds fast his integrity, although you moved me against him, to destroy him without cause.">Job 2:3</a>. And in the parallel passage Zechariah 3 his cold-blooded cruelty in the exercise of his office against the miserable and in a moral sense the somewhat ragged Church of the Restoration stands rebuked before the spirit of Divine compassion: “The Lord rebuke thee Satan, is not this a brand plucked from the burning?” Subsequent revelation made advances on the doctrine of Satan, the discussion of which, however, does not belong here.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>6–12. The disinterestedness of Job’s piety brought under suspicion by the Adversary in the Council of Heaven<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>After the scene of happiness and piety presented by Job’s home on earth, the Poet draws the veil aside and shews us a scene in heaven. The Council of the Most High convenes. Around the throne of the King, whose subject and servant Job is, stand “his ministers that do his pleasure,” <a href="/psalms/103-21.htm" title="Bless you the LORD, all you his hosts; you ministers of his, that do his pleasure.">Psalm 103:21</a>. Their offices are various. The office of one of them is to try the sincerity of men, and put their religion to the proof. Job’s piety is commended on the part of God, but suspicions regarding its disinterestedness are insinuated on the part of this angel. He receives permission to try Job, with the reservation that he must not afflict him in his person.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord</span>. By "the sons of God" it is generally admitted that, in this place, the angels are meant (so again in <a href="/job/38-7.htm">Job 38:7</a>). The meaning of the phrase is probably different in <a href="/genesis/6-2.htm">Genesis 6:2</a>. Angels and men are alike "sons of God," as created by him, in his image, to obey and serve him. Christ, the "Only Begotten," is his Son in quite a different sense. We may gather, perhaps, from this place and <a href="/job/2-1.htm">Job 2:1</a> that there are fixed times at which the angelic host, often sent out by the Almighty on distant errands, has to gather together, one and all, before the great white throne, to pay homage to their Lord, and probably to give an account of their doings<span class="cmt_word">. And Satan came also among them</span>. The word "Satan" has the article prefixed to it <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5ea;&#x5df;</span> here and elsewhere in Job, as in <a href="/zechariah/3-1.htm">Zechariah 3:1, 2</a> and in <a href="/luke/22-31.htm">Luke 22:31</a>; <a href="/revelation/12-9.htm">Revelation 12:9</a>. Thus accompanied, it is less a proper name than an appellative - "the adversary" (comp. <a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>; <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>). In <a href="/1_chronicles/21-1.htm">1 Chronicles 21:1</a>, without the article, it is undoubtedly a proper name, as in the New Testament, <span class="accented">passim</span>. Accusation of men before God is one of the special offices of the evil spirit (see <a href="/zechariah/3-1.htm">Zechariah 3:1, 2</a>), who is "the accuser of the brethren, he that accuses  them before God day and night" (<a href="/revelation/12-10.htm">Revelation 12:10</a>). The accusations that he makes may be either true or false, but they are so often false that his ordinary New Testament name is <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "the Slanderer." The existence of an evil spirit must have been known to all who read or heard the story of the fall of man (<a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>.), and the descriptive epithet, "the Adversary," is likely to have been in use from a very early date. The notion that the Satan of the Old Testament is a reflex of the Persian Ahriman, and that the Jews derived their belief upon the subject from the Persians, is quite untenable. The character and position of Satan in the Hebrew system are quite unlike those of Ahriman (<span class="accented">Angro-mainyus</span>) in the religion of the Zoroastrians (see 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 3. pp. 104-113). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/esther/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>And King Ahashverosh laid a tribute upon the land, and upon the isles of the sea. <a href="/esther/10-2.htm">Esther 10:2</a>.

As the provinces of the kingdom paid the imposts for the most part in natural produce, which they had reared or obtained by the labour of their hands, their labour (agriculture, cattle-keeping, etc.) was to a certain extent service rendered to the king. The matter of <a href="/esther/10-1.htm">Esther 10:1</a> seems extraneous to the contents of our book, which has hitherto communicated only such information concerning Ahashverosh as was necessary for the complete understanding of the feast of Purim. "It seems" - remarks Bertheau - "as thou the historian had intended to tell in some further particulars concerning the greatness of King Ahashverosh, for the sake of giving his readers a more accurate notion of the influential position and the agency of Mordochai, the hero of his book, who, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/esther/9-4.htm">Esther 9:4</a>, waxed greater and greater; but then gave up his intention, and contented himself with referring to the book of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia, which contained information of both the power and might of Ahashverosh and the greatness of Mordochai." There is not, however, the slightest probability in such a conjecture. This matter may be simply explained by the circumstance, that the author of this book was using as an authority the book of the chronicles alluded to in <a href="//biblehub.com/esther/10-2.htm">Esther 10:2</a>, and is quite analogous with the mode observed in the books of Kings and Chronicles by historians both of Babylonian and post-Babylonian days, who quote from the documents they make use of such events only as seem to them important with regard to the plan of their own work, and then at the close of each reign refer to the documents themselves, in which more may be found concerning the acts of the kings, at the same time frequently adding supplementary information from these sources, - comp. e.g., <a href="/1_kings/14-30.htm">1 Kings 14:30</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/15-7.htm">1 Kings 15:7</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/15-23.htm">1 Kings 15:23</a>, <a href="/1_kings/15-32.htm">1 Kings 15:32</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/22-47.htm">1 Kings 22:47-50</a>; <a href="/2_kings/15-37.htm">2 Kings 15:37</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-15.htm">2 Chronicles 12:15</a>, - with this difference only, that in these instances the supplementary notices follow the mention of the documents, while in the present book the notice precedes the citation. As, however, this book opened with a description of the power and glory of King Ahashverosh, but yet only mentioned so much concerning this ruler of 127 provinces as was connected with the history of the Jews, its author, before referring to his authorities, gives at its close the information contained in <a href="//biblehub.com/esther/10-1.htm">Esther 10:1</a>, from the book of the chronicles of the kingdom, in which probably it was connected with a particular description of the power and greatness of Ahashverosh, and probably of the wars in which he engaged, for the sake of briefly intimating at the conclusion whence the king derived the means for keeping up the splendour described at the commencement of the book. This book of the chronicles contained accounts not only of the power and might of Ahashverosh, but also a &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;, a plain statement or accurate representation of the greatness of Mordochai wherewith the king had made him great, i.e., to which he had advanced him, and therefore of the honours of the individual to whom the Jews were indebted for their preservation. On this account is it referred to. For Mordochai was next to the king, i.e., prime minister of the king (&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492;, comp. <a href="/2_chronicles/28-7.htm">2 Chronicles 28:7</a>), and great among the Jews and acceptable to the multitude of his brethren, i.e., he was also a great man among the Jews and was beloved and esteemed by all his fellow-countrymen (on &#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1497;, comp. <a href="/deuteronomy/23-24.htm">Deuteronomy 23:24</a>), seeking the good of his people and speaking peace to all his race. This description of Mordochai's position with respect both to the king and his own people has, as expressive of an exalted frame of mind, a rhetorical and poetic tinge. Hence it contains such expressions as &#1488;&#1495;&#1497;&#1493; &#1512;&#1489;, the fulness of his brethren, &#1496;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489; &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;; comp. <a href="/psalms/122-9.htm">Psalm 122:9</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/38-4.htm">Jeremiah 38:4</a>. On &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501; &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;, comp. <a href="/psalms/85-9.htm">Psalm 85:9</a>; <a href="/psalms/35-20.htm">Psalm 35:20</a>; <a href="/psalms/27-3.htm">Psalm 27:3</a>. &#1494;&#1512;&#1506;&#1493; in parallelism with &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493; is not the descendants of Mordochai, or his people, but his race. Comp. on this signification of &#1494;&#1512;&#1506;, <a href="/2_kings/11-1.htm">2 Kings 11:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/61-9.htm">Isaiah 61:9</a>. The meaning of the two last phrases is: Mordochai procured both by word and deed the good and prosperity of his people. And this is the way in which honour and fortune are attained, the way inculcated by the author of the 34th Psalm in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/34-13.htm">Psalm 34:13</a>, when teaching the fear of the Lord.</body></html>
