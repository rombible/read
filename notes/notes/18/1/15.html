The Septuagint gives a paraphrase, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788; &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2; &#x3b7;&#787;&#x3c7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;  kai elthonia hoi aichmalo&#772;teuontes e&#772;chmalo&#772;teusan, "And the plunderers coming, plundered them," or made them captive. On the situation of Sheba and Seba, see <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/43-3.htm">Isaiah 43:3</a>, note; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/45-14.htm">Isaiah 45:14</a>, note; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>, note. The people here referred to were, undoubtedly, inhabitants of some part of Arabia Felix. There are three persons of the name of Sheba mentioned in the Scriptures.<p>(1) A grandson of Cush; <a href="/genesis/10-7.htm">Genesis 10:7</a>.<p>(2) A son of Joktan; <a href="/genesis/10-28.htm">Genesis 10:28</a>.<p>(3) A son of Jokshan, the son of Abraham by Keturah.<p>"Calmet." The Sheba here referred to was probably in the southern part of Arabia, and from the narrative it is evident that the Sabeans here mentioned were a predatory tribe. It is not improbable that these tribes were in the habit of wandering for purposes of plunder over the whole country, from the banks of the Euphrates to the outskirts of Egypt. The Bedawin Arabs of the present day resemble in a remarkable manner the ancient inhabitants of Arabia, and for many centuries the manners of the inhabitants of Arabia have not changed, for the habits of the Orientals continue the same from age to age. The Syriac renders this simply, "a multitude rushed" upon them;" omitting the word "Sabean."<p>Fell upon them - With violence; or rushed unexpectedly upon them. This is the way in which the Arab tribes now attack the caravan, the traveler, or the village, for plunder.<p>And took them away - As plunder. It is common now to make such sudden incursions, and to carry off a large booty.<p>They have slain the servants - Hebrew &#1504;&#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;  na&#8219;ar&#305;&#770;ym, "the young men." The word &#1504;&#1506;&#1512;  na&#8219;ar, properly means a "boy," and is applied to an infant just born, <a href="/exodus/2-6.htm">Exodus 2:6</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/13-5.htm">Judges 13:5</a>, <a href="/judges/13-7.htm">Judges 13:7</a>; or to a youth, <a href="/genesis/34-19.htm">Genesis 34:19</a>; <a href="/genesis/41-12.htm">Genesis 41:12</a>. It came then to denote a servant or slave, like the Greek &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2;  pais; <a href="/genesis/24-2.htm">Genesis 24:2</a>; <a href="/2_kings/5-20.htm">2 Kings 5:20</a>; compare <a href="/acts/5-6.htm">Acts 5:6</a>. So the word "boy" is often used in the Southern States of North America to denote a slave. Here it evidently means the servants that were employed in cultivating the lands of Job, and keeping his cattle. There is no intimation that they were slaves. Jerome renders it "pueros, boys;" so the Septuagint &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;  tous paidas.<p>And I only am escaped alone - By myself, &#1489;&#1491;  bad. There is no other one with me. It is remarkable that the same account is given by each one of the servants who escaped, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/1-16.htm">Job 1:16-17</a>, <a href="/job/1-19.htm">Job 1:19</a>. The Chaldee has given a very singular version of this - apparently from the desire of accounting for everything, and of mentioning the "names" of all the persons intended.

We may suppose that hem, either the general sense is intended, or, if the specific one, then that, at the date whereto the story of Job belongs, there were Sabeans in Eastern as well as in Southern Arabia, in the neighbourhood of the Upper Persian Gulf as well as in the neighbourhood of the Indian Ocean. The plundering habits of all the Arab tribes are well known. Strabo says that the Sabeans, even at the height of their prosperity, made excursions for the sake of plunder into Arabia Petraea and even Syria (Strab., 16:4) <span class="cmt_word">Yea, they have slain</span>; rather, <span class="accented">they slew</span>, or <span class="accented">they smote. <span class="cmt_word"></span>The servants</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the young men</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the labourers who were engaged in ploughing, and would be in duty bound to resist the carrying off of the cattle. <span class="cmt_word">With the edge of the sword</span>.

Hast Thou not made a hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? Hast Thou not blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land? But put forth Thine hand now, and touch all that he hath: truly he will renounce Thee to Thy face.<p>Satan is, according to the <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/12-10.htm">Revelation 12:10</a>, the &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3c1; who accuses the servants of God day and night before God. It is a fact respecting the invisible world, though expressed in the language and imagery of this world. So long as he is not finally vanquished and condemned, he has access to God, and thinks to justify himself by denying the truth of the existence and the possibility of the continuance of all piety. God permits it; for since everything happening to the creature is placed under the law of free development, evil in the world of spirits is also free to maintain and expand itself, until a spiritual power comes forward against it, by which the hitherto wavering conflict between the principles of good and evil is decided. This is the truth contained in the poetic description of the heavenly scene, sadly mistaken by Umbreit in his Essay on Sin, 1853, in which he explains Satan, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/109-6.htm">Psalm 109:6</a>, as a creation of our author's fancy. The paucity of the declarations respecting Satan in the Old Testament has misled him. And indeed the historical advance from the Old Testament to the New, though in itself well authorized, has in many ways of late induced to the levelling of the heights and depths of the New Testament. Formerly Umbreit was of the opinion, as many are still, that the idea of Satan is derived from Persia; but between Ahriman (Angramainyus) and Satan there is no striking resemblance;<p>(Note: Moreover, it is still questionable whether the form of the ancient doctrine of fire-worship among the Persians did not result from Jewish influences. Vid., Stuhr, Religionssysteme der herdn. Vlker des Orients, S. 373-75.)<p>whereas Diestel, in his Abh. ber Set-Typhon, Asasel und Satan, Stud. u. Krit., 1860, 2, cannot indeed recognise any connection between &#1506;&#1494;&#1488;&#1494;&#1500; and the Satan of the book of Job, but maintains a more complete harmony in all substantial marks between the latter and the Egyptian Typhon, and infers that "to Satan is therefore to be denied a purely Israelitish originality, the natural outgrowth of the Hebrew mind. It is indeed no special honour for Israel to be able to call him their own. He never has taken firm hold on the Hebrew consciousness." But how should it be no honour for Israel, the people to whom the revelation of redemption was made, and in whose history the plan of redemption was developed, to have traced the poisonous stream of evil up to the fountain of its first free beginning in the spiritual world, and to have more than superficially understood the history of the fall of mankind by sin, which points to a disguised superhuman power, opposed to the divine will? This perception undoubtedly only begins gradually to dawn in the Old Testament; but in the New Testament, the abyss of evil is fully disclosed, and Satan has so far a hold on the consciousness of Jesus, that He regards His life's vocation as a conflict with Satan. And the Protevangelium is deciphered in facts, when the promised seed of the woman crushed the serpent's head, but at the same time suffered the bruising of its own heel.<p>The view (e.g., Lutz in his Biblishce Dogmatik) that Satan as he is represented in the book of Job is not the later evil spirit, is to be rejected: he appears here only first, say Herder and Eichhorn, as impartial executor of judgment, and overseer of morality, commissioned by God. But he denies what God affirms, acknowledges no love towards God in the world which is not rooted in self-love, and is determined to destroy this love as a mere semblance. Where piety is dulled, he rejoices in its obscurity; where it is not, he dims its lustre by reflecting his own egotistical nature therein. Thus it is in <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/3-1.htm">Zechariah 3:1-10</a>, and so here. Genuine love loves God &#1495;&#1504;&#1468;&#1501; (adverb from &#1495;&#1503;, like gratis from gratia): it loves Him for His own sake; it is a relation of person to person, without any actual stipulations and claim. But Job does not thus fear God; &#1497;&#1512;&#1488; is here praet., whereas in <a href="/job/1-1.htm">Job 1:1</a> and <a href="/job/1-8.htm">Job 1:8</a> it is the adjective. God has indeed hitherto screened him from all evil; &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1514;&#1468; from &#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498;, sepire, and &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1491; (&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1491;) composed of &#1489;&#1468; and &#1506;&#1491;, in the primary signification circum, since &#1506;&#1491; expresses that the one joins itself to the other, and &#1489;&#1468; that it covers it, or covers itself with it. By the addition of &#1502;&#1505;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489;, the idea of the triple &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1491; is still strengthened. &#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;, lxx, Vulg., have translated by the plural, which is not false according to the thought; for &#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; &#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; is, especially in Deuteronomy, a favourite collective expression for human enterprise. &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1509;, a word, with the Sanskrito-Sem. frangere, related to &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1511;, signifying to break through the bounds, multiply and increase one's self unboundedly (<a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/30-30.htm">Genesis 30:30</a>, and freq.). The particle &#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1501;, proper only to the oldest and classic period, and very commonly used in the first four books of the Pentateuch, and in our book, generally &#1493;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1501;, is an emphatic "nevertheless;" Lat. (suited to this passage at least) verum enim vero. &#1488;&#1501;&#1470;&#1500;&#1488; is either, as frequently, a shortened formula of asseveration: May such and such happen to me if he do not, etc.,  equals  forsooth he will (lxx &#x3b7;&#787;&#834; &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;); or it is half a question: Attempt only this and this, whether he will not deny thee,  equals  annon, as <a href="/job/17-2.htm">Job 17:2</a>; <a href="/job/22-20.htm">Job 22:20</a>. The first perhaps suits the character of Satan better: he affirms that God is mistaken. &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; signifies here also, valedicere: he will say farewell to thee, and indeed &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1498; (as <a href="/isaiah/65-3.htm">Isaiah 65:3</a>), meeting thee arrogantly and shamelessly: it signifies, properly, upon thy countenance, i.e., say it to thee, to the very face, that he will have nothing more to do with thee (comp. on <a href="/job/2-5.htm">Job 2:5</a>). In order now that the truth of His testimony to Job's piety, and this piety itself, may be tried, Jehovah surrenders all Job's possessions, all that is his, except himself, to Satan. </body></html>
