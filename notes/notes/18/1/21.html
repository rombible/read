Whether history or a parable, its worth is the same, as tortured hearts have felt for countless centuries, and will feel to the end. Perhaps no picture that was ever painted is grander and more touching than that of the man of Uz, in the antique wealth and happiness of his brighter days, rich, joyful, with his children round him, living in men’s honour, and walking upright before God. Then come the dramatic completeness and suddenness of his great trials. One day strips him of all, and stripped of all he rises to a loftier dignity, for there is a majesty as well as an isolation in his sorrow.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> How many spirits tossed by afflictions have found peace in these words! How many quivering lips have tried to utter their grave, calm accents! To how many of us are they hallowed by memories of times when they stood between us and despair!<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> They seem to me to say everything that can be said about our trials and losses, to set forth the whole truth of the facts, and to present the whole series of feelings with which good men may and should be exercised.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. The vindication of sorrow.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>He ‘rent his clothes’-the signs and tokens of inward desolation and loss.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> It is worth our while to stay for one moment with the thought that we are meant to feel grief. God sends sorrows in order that they may pain. Sorrow has its manifold uses in our lives and on our hearts. It is natural. That is enough. God set the fountain of tears in our souls. We are bidden not to ‘despise the chastening of the Lord.’ It is they who are ‘exercised’ thereby to whom the chastisement is blessed.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> It is sanctioned by Christ. He wept. He bade the women of Jerusalem weep for themselves and for their children.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Religion does not destroy the natural emotions-sorrow as little as any other. It guides, controls, curbs, comforts, and brings blessings out of it. So do not aim at an impossible stoicism, but permit nature to have its way, and look at the picture of this manly sorrow of Job’s-calm, silent, unless when stung by the undeserved reproaches of these three ‘orthodox liars for God,’ and going to God and worshipping.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. The recognition of loss and sorrow as the law of life.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>‘Naked came I out of my mother’s womb.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> We need not dwell on the figure ‘mother,’ suggesting the grave as the kindly mother’s bosom that gathers us all in, and the thought that perhaps gleams forth that death, too, is a kind of birth.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> But the truth picturesquely set forth is just the old and simple one-that all possessions are transient.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The naked self gets clothed and lapped round with possessions, but they are all outside of it, apart from its individuality. It has been without them. It will be without them. Death at the end will rob us of them all.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The inevitable law of loss is fixed and certain. We are losing something every moment-not only possessions, but all our dearest ties are knit but for a time, and sure to be snapped. They go, and then after a while we go.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The independence of each soul of all its possessions and relations is as certain as the loss of them. They may go and we are made naked, but still we exist all the same. We have to learn the hard lesson which sounds so unfeeling, that we can live on in spite of all losses. Nothing, no one, is necessary to us.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> All this is very cold and miserable; it is the standing point of law and necessity. An atheist could say it. It is the beginning of the Christian contemplation of life, but only the beginning.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">III. The recognition of God in the law.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>‘The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away.’ That is a step far beyond the former. To bring in the thought of <span class="ital">the Lord</span> makes a world of difference.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The tendency is to look only at the second cause. In Job’s case there were two classes of agencies, men, Chaldeans and Sabeans, and natural causes, fire and wind, but he did not stop with these.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The grand corrective of that tendency lies in the full theistic idea, that God is the sole cause of all. The immanence of Deity in all things and events is our refuge from the soul-crushing tyranny of the reign of law.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> That devout recognition of God in law is eminently to be made in regard to death, as Job does in the text: ‘The number of his months is with Thee.’ Death is not any more nor any less under His control than all other human incidents are. It has no special sanctity, nor abnormally close connection with His will, but it no more is exempt from such connection than all the other events of life. The connection is real. He opens the gate of the grave and no man shuts. He shuts, and no man opens.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Job did not forget the Lord’s gifts even while he was writhing under the stroke of His withdrawings. Alas! that it should so often need sorrow to bear into our hearts that we owe all to Him, but even then, if not before, it is well to remember how much good we have received of the Lord, and the remembrance should not be ‘a sorrow’s crown of sorrow,’ but a thankful one.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">IV. The thankful resignation to God’s loving administration of the law.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>The preceding words might be said with mere submission to an irresistible power, but this last sentence climbs to the highest of the true Christian idea. It recognises in loss and sorrow a reason for praise.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Why?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Because we may be sure that all loss is for our good.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Because we may be sure that all loss is from a loving God. In loss of dear ones, <span class="ital">our</span> gain is in drawing nearer to God, in being taught more to long for heaven. In our relation to them, a loftier love, a hallowing of all the past. <span class="ital">Their</span> gain is in their entrance to heaven, and all the glory that they have reached.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> This blessing of God for loss is not inconsistent with sorrow, but anticipates the future when we shall know all and bless Him for all.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/job/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/job/1-21.htm" title="And said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: the LORD gave, and the LORD has taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD.">Job 1:21</a></span>. <span class="ital">Naked came I out of my mother’s womb </span>— I brought none of those things which I have now lost with me when I came out of my mother’s womb into the world, but I received them from the hand and favour of that God who hath now required his own again; <span class="ital">and naked shall I return — </span>I shall be as rich when I die as I was when I was born; and therefore have reason to be contented with my condition, which also is the common lot of all men. We go naked out of the world into the womb or lap of our common mother the earth, as the weary child lays its head on its mother’s bosom. Death strips us of all our possessions and enjoyments; clothing can neither warm nor adorn a dead body: a consideration which silenced Job under all his losses. The sanctified soul, however, goes out of the world clothed, (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-3.htm" title="If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.">2 Corinthians 5:3</a>,) and when it appears in the presence of God is not found naked. <span class="ital">The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away — </span>He hath taken away nothing but his own; nothing but what he so gave to me as to reserve the supreme dominion and disposal of it in his own hand.

He reasons from the common state of human life, which he describes. We brought nothing of this world's goods into the world, but have them from others; and it is certain we can carry nothing out, but must leave them to others. Job, under all his losses, is but reduced to his first state. He is but where he must have been at last, and is only unclothed, or unloaded rather, a little sooner than he expected. If we put off our clothes before we go to bed, it is some inconvenience, but it may be the better borne when it is near bed-time. The same who gave hath taken away. See how Job looks above instruments, and keeps his eye upon the First Cause. Afflictions must not divert us from, but quicken us to religion. If in all our troubles we look to the Lord, he will support us. The Lord is righteous. All we have is from his gift; we have forfeited it by sin, and ought not to complain if he takes any part from us. Discontent and impatience charge God with folly. Against these Job carefully watched; and so must we, acknowledging that as God has done right, but we have done wickedly, so God has done wisely, but we have done very foolishly. And may the malice and power of Satan render that Saviour more precious to our souls, who came to destroy the works of the devil; who, for our salvation, suffered from that enemy far more than Job suffered, or we can think.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And said, Naked came I out - That is, destitute of property, for so the connection demands; compare <a href="/1_timothy/6-7.htm">1 Timothy 6:7</a>; "For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out." A similar expression also occurs in Pliny, "Hominem natura tanturn nudism." Nat. Hist. proem. L. vii. Job felt that he was stripped of all, and that he must leave the world as destitute as he entered it.<p>My mother's womb - The earth - the universal mother. That he refers to the earth is apparent, because he speaks of returning there again. The Chaldee adds &#1511;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;&#1488; &#1500;&#1489;&#1497;&#1514;  lebe&#772;yt qebu&#770;rata&#772;' - "to the house of burial." The earth is often called the mother of mankind; see Cic. de Nat. Deor. ii. 26; compare <a href="/psalms/139-15.htm">Psalm 139:15</a>. Dr. Good remarks, that "the origin of all things from the earth introduced, at a very early period of the world, the superstitious worship of the earth, under the title of Dameter, or the "Mother-goddess," a Chaldee term, probably common to Idumea at the time of the existence of Job himself. It is hence the Greeks derive their &#x394;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bd;&#x3c1;  De&#772;me&#772;te&#772;r (Demeter), or as they occasionally wrote it &#x393;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;  Ge&#772;me&#772;te&#772;r (Ge-meter), or Mother Earth, to whom they appropriated annually two religious festivals of extraordinary pomp and solemnity. Thus, Lucretius says,<p>Linquitur, ut merito materhum nomen adepta<p>Terra sit, e terra quoniam sunt cuneta creata.<p>v. 793.<p> - "Whence justly earth<p>Claims the dear name of mother, since alone<p>Flowed from herself whate'er the sight enjoys."<p>For a full account of the views of the ancients in regard to the "marriage" (&#x3b9;&#788;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; &#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  gamos hieros)of the "heaven" and the "earth," from which union all things were supposed to proceed, see Creuzer's Symbolik und Mythologie der alt. Volk. Erst. Theil, p. 26, fg.<p>And naked - Stripped of all, I shall go to the common mother of the race. This is exceedingly beautiful language; and in the mouth of Job it was expressive of the most submissive piety. It is not the language of complaint; but was in him connected with the deep feeling that the loss of his property was to be traced to God, and that he had a right to do as he had done.<p>The Lord gave - Hebrew &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; yehova&#770;h. He had nothing when he came into the world, and all that he had obtained had been by the good providence of God. As "he" gave it, he had a right to remove it. Such was the feeling of Job, and such is the true language of submission everywhere. He who has a proper view of what he possesses will feel that it is all to be traced to God, and that he has a right to remove it when he pleases.<p>And the Lord hath taken away - It is not by accident; it is not the result of haphazard; it is not to be traced to storms and winds and the bad passions of people. It is the result of intelligent design, and whoever has been the agent or instrument in it, it is to be referred to the overruling providence of God. Why did not Job vent his wrath on the Sabeans? Why did he not blame the Chaldeans? Why did he not curse the tempest and the storm? Why did he not blame his sons for exposing themselves? Why not suspect the malice of Satan? Why not suggest that the calamity was to be traced to bad fortune, to ill-luck, or or to an evil administration of human affairs? None of these things occurred to Job. He traced the removal of his property and his loss of children at once to God, and found consolation in the belief that an intelligent and holy Sovereign presided over his affairs, and that he had removed only what he gave.<p>Blessed be the name of the Lord - That is, blessed be yahweh - the "name" of anyone in Hebrew being often used to denote the person himself. The Syriac, Arabic, and some manuscripts of the Septuagint here adds "forever." - "Here," says Schmid, "the contrast is observable between the object of Satan, which was to induce Job to renounce God, and the result of the temptation which was to lead Job to bless God." Thus, far Satan had been foiled, and Job had sustained the shock of the calamity, and showed that he did not serve God on account of the benefits which be had received from him. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21.

Job considered he did not bring his substance, his servants, and his children into the world with him; and now they were taken from him, he was but as he was when he came into the world, and not at all the worse; he knew how to be abased, and to abound, and in both was content: <p>and naked shall I return thither; not into his mother's womb in a literal sense, which was impossible, <a href="//biblehub.com/john/3-4.htm">John 3:4</a>, but to the earth, and to the dust of it, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/3-19.htm">Genesis 3:19</a>, pointing to it with his finger, on which he now lay; meaning that he should go to the place appointed for him, the grave, the house of all living, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/30-23.htm">Job 30:23</a>, and so the Targum here has it, <p>to the house of the grave, where he should lie unseen, as in his mother's womb, till the resurrection morn; which would be a kind of a regeneration of him, when he should be delivered up from thence, and enjoy a state of happiness and glory: he should descend into the grave as naked as he was born, respecting not so much the nakedness of his body, as being stripped of all worldly enjoyments, see <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:15</a> and he says this in his present view of things; he thought once he should have died in his nest, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/29-18.htm">Job 29:18</a>, in the midst of all his prosperity, and left a large substance to his children; but now all was taken away, and for the present had no hope or expectation of a restoration, as afterwards was; but whereas he was now naked and bare of all, he expected he should continue and die so: or this is said with respect to the common case of men, who it is certain cannot carry anything out of the world with them, either riches or honour, but must leave all behind them, <a href="/1_timothy/6-7.htm">1 Timothy 6:7</a> which may serve to loosen the minds of men from worldly things, not to set their eyes and hearts upon them, nor to put their trust and confidence in them; and good men may part with them, especially at death with pleasure, since they will have no further use of them, and will have a better and a more enduring substance in their stead: <p>the Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; all outward enjoyments, all the good things of this world, are the Lord's, and at his dispose; the earth, and the fulness of it; kingdoms, nations, countries, houses and lands, the beasts of the field, and cattle on a thousand hills; the gold and silver, and all the riches of the earth: and these are the gifts of his providence to the sons of men; nor have they anything but in a way of giving and receiving; and even what they enjoy, through diligence and industry, is owing to the blessing of God; and who gives not in such sort as that he loses his property in what is given; this he still retains, these are talents which he puts into the hands of men to use for themselves and others, and for which they are accountable to him; and they are but stewards, with whom he will hereafter reckon, and therefore has a right to take away when he pleases; and both Job ascribes to God, not only the giving, but the taking away: he does not attribute his losses to second causes, to the Sabeans and Chaldeans, to the fire from heaven, and the wind from the desert, but to God, whose sovereign will and overruling hand were in all; these were but the instruments of Satan, and he had no power but what was given from God; and therefore to the counsel of his will, who suffered it, Job refers it, and for that reason sits down satisfied and quiet. This is all to be understood of temporal things only; for of spiritual things it cannot be said that God gives and takes away; such gifts are without repentance, and are irreversible, <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/11-29.htm">Romans 11:29</a>, the Targum is, <p>"the Word of the Lord hath given, and the Word of the Lord and the house of his judgment hath taken away; the Septuagint and Vulgate Latin versions add, <p>as it pleased the Lord, so it is done:'' <p>blessed be the name of the Lord; for all his blessings and mercies; for all the gifts of nature and providence that had been bestowed, which could not be claimed, and of which he knew himself unworthy; and for the continuance of them so long with goodness and mercy had followed him all the days or his life hitherto, and still he had mercies to bless God for; his wife was still with him, he had some servants left, his own life was spared; he continued as yet in health of body, and therefore could sing of mercy as well as judgment; nor is there any state on earth a man can be in, but there is something to bless God for; wherefore the apostle's exhortation will always hold good, "in everything give thanks": <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-18.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:18</a>; besides the name, the nature, the perfections, of God are always the same, and therefore always to be celebrated, and blessing, honour, and glory, are to be ascribed to him continually, in every state and condition of life; wherefore the Arabic version adds, "from henceforth, and for ever"; which agrees with <a href="/psalms/72-19.htm">Psalm 72:19</a>; and thus Job, instead of cursing God, blesses him, and proves the devil to be a liar, as he was from the beginning; and shows his superiority over him through the power of divine grace; this evil one could not touch him, he was overcome by him, and his designs defeated. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> thither: the LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken away; <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> blessed be the name of the LORD.</span><p>(b) That is, into the belly of the earth, which is the mother of all.<p>(c) By this he confesses that God is just and good, although his hand is sore on him.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/job/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">21</span>. <span class="ital">naked shall I return thither</span>] The general sense is plain, though the precise idea is obscure. The words “my mother’s womb” must be used literally, and <span class="ital">return thither</span> somewhat inexactly, to describe a condition similar to that which preceded entrance upon life and light. Or, as growth in the womb is described, <a href="/psalms/139-15.htm" title="My substance was not hid from you, when I was made in secret, and curiously worked in the lowest parts of the earth.">Psalm 139:15</a>, as “being curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth,” the womb and the bosom of the earth, “the mother of all,” may be compared together. “We brought nothing into the world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out,” <a href="/1_timothy/6-7.htm" title="For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out.">1 Timothy 6:7</a>.

Perhaps the phrase was a general one which alteration would have spoiled; or more likely, the writer was so much in sympathy with the sentiment put into Job’s mouth that it escaped him for the moment that it was not himself or his nation but one foreign to Israel that was uttering it.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither</span>. There is some difficulty in the word "thither," since no man returns to his mother's womb (<a href="/john/3-4.htm">John 3:4</a>), at death or otherwise. The expression must not be pressed. It arises out of the analogy, constantly felt and acknowledged, between "mother" earth and a man's actual mother (setup. Psalm 129:15). <span class="cmt_word">The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away</span>. Job is here represented as knowing God by his name "Jehovah," though elsewhere the "great Name" appears once only in the words of Job (<a href="/job/12-9.htm">Job 12:9</a>), and never in the words of his friends. The natural <span class="accented">conclusion is</span> that the name was known in the land of Uz at the time, but was very rarely used - scarcely, except in moments of excitement. <span class="cmt_word">Blessed be the Name of the Lord</span>; literally, <span class="accented">may the Name of Jehovah be blessed!</span> The ermphatic word is kept for the last. According to Satan, Job was to have" cursed God to his face" (ver. 11). The event is that he openly and resolutely blesses God. That the same word is used in its two opposite senses rather accentuates the antithesis. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>13-15  And it came to pass one day, when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their eldest brother, that a messenger came to Job, and said, The oxen were ploughing, and the asses feeding beside them, when the Sabeans fell upon them, and carried them away, and smote the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.<p>The principal clause, &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1501; &#1493;&#1497;&#1492;&#1497;, in which the art. of &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1501; has no more reference to anything preceding than in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/1-6.htm">Job 1:6</a>, is immediately followed by an adverbial clause, which may be expressed by participles, Lat. filiis ejus filiabusque convivantibus. The details which follow are important. Job had celebrated the usual weekly worship early in the morning with his children, and knew that they were met together in the house of his eldest son, with whom the order of mutual entertainment came round again, when the messengers of misfortune began to break in upon him: it is therefore on the very day when, by reason of the sacrifice offered, he was quite sure of Jehovah's favour. The participial construction, the oxen were ploughing (vid., Ges. 134, 2, c), describes the condition which was disturbed by the calamity that befell them. The verb &#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468; stands here because the clause is a principal one, not as <a href="//biblehub.com/job/1-13.htm">Job 1:13</a>, adverbial. &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1497;&#1491;&#1497;, properly "at hand," losing its radical meaning, signifies (as <a href="/judges/11-26.htm">Judges 11:26</a>) "close by." The interpretation "in their places," after <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/2-17.htm">Numbers 2:17</a>, is untenable, as this signification of &#1497;&#1491; is only supported in the sing. &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1488; is construed as fem., since the name of the country is used as the name of the people. In Genesis three races of this name are mentioned: Cushite (<a href="/genesis/10-7.htm">Genesis 10:7</a>), Joktanish (<a href="/genesis/10-28.htm">Genesis 10:28</a>), and Abrahamic (<a href="/genesis/25-3.htm">Genesis 25:3</a>). Here the nomadic portion of this mixed race in North Arabia from the Persian Gulf to Idumaea is intended. Luther, for the sake of clearness, translates here, and <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/10-1.htm">1 Kings 10:1</a>, Arabia. In &#1493;&#1488;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1496;&#1492;, the waw, as is seen from the Kametz, is waw convertens, and the paragogic ah, which otherwise indicates the cohortative, is either without significance, or simply adds intensity to the verbal idea: I have saved myself with great difficulty. For this common form of the 1 fut. consec., occurring four times in the Pentateuch, vid., Ges. 49, 2. The clause &#1500;&#1498; &#1500;&#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491; is objective: in order that - so it was intended by the calamity - I might tell thee. </body></html>
