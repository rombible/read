Or, as Schultens paraphrases the words, “He will, with the highest degree of insolence and contumacy, entirely renounce thee and religion.” Thus, when Satan could not accuse Job of any thing really ill, he charges him with having merely selfish and sinister ends in view in doing good, which was, in effect, charging him with being a hypocrite. Let us not think it strange if those who are approved and accepted of God, be unjustly censured by the devil and his instruments; and if they be otherwise perfectly unexceptionable, it is easy to charge them with hypocrisy, as Satan charged Job, and they have no way to clear themselves, but patiently to wait for the judgment of God. As there is nothing we should dread more than being hypocrites, so there is nothing we should dread less than being called and accounted so without cause. It was a great truth that Job did not fear God for naught; he got much by it: for <span class="ital">godliness is great gain. </span>But it was a false lie that he would not have feared God if he had not got this by it, as the event proved. Job’s friends charged him with hypocrisy because he was greatly afflicted, Satan because he greatly prospered. It is no hard matter for those to calumniate that seek occasion. Let us remember it is not mercenary to look at the eternal recompense in our obedience; but to aim merely or chiefly at temporal advantages in our religion, and to make it subservient to them, is spiritual idolatry, worshipping the creature more than the Creator, and is likely to end in a fatal apostacy. Men cannot long <span class="ital">serve God and Mammon.</span><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/job/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:6-12 Job's afflictions began from the malice of Satan, by the Lord's permission, for wise and holy purposes. There is an evil spirit, the enemy of God, and of all righteousness, who is continually seeking to distress, to lead astray, and, if possible, to destroy those who love God. How far his influence may extend, we cannot say; but probably much unsteadiness and unhappiness in Christians may be ascribed to him. While we are on this earth we are within his reach. Hence it concerns us to be sober and vigilant, 1Pe 5:8. See how Satan censures Job. This is the common way of slanderers, to suggest that which they have no reason to think is true. But as there is nothing we should dread more than really being hypocrites, so there is nothing we need dread less than being called and counted so without cause. It is not wrong to look at the eternal recompence in our obedience; but it is wrong to aim at worldly advantages in our religion. God's people are taken under his special protection; they, and all that belong to them. The blessing of the Lord makes rich; Satan himself owns it. God suffered Job to be tried, as he suffered Peter to be sifted. It is our comfort that God has the devil in a chain, Re 20:1. He has no power to lead men to sin, but what they give him themselves; nor any power to afflict men, but what is given him from above. All this is here described to us after the manner of men. The Scripture speaks thus to teach us that God directs the affairs of the world.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But put forth thine hand now - That is, for the purpose of injuring him, and taking away his property.<p>And touch all that he hath - Dr. Good renders this, "and smite."

Professor  Lee translates, "If not, he will bless thee to thy face;" the LXX., "Surely he will bless thee to thy face;" Canon Cook, "See if he will not renounce thee openly." But the majority of Hebraists agree with the Authorized Version. Satan suggests that, if Job be stripped of his possessions, he will openly curse God, and renounce his worship. Here he did not so much calumniate, or lie, as show the evil thoughts that were in his own heart. No doubt he believed that Job would act as he said. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>4, 5  And his sons went and feasted in the house of him whose day it was, and sent and called for their sisters to eat and drink with them.

Thus did Job continually.<p>The subordinate facts precede, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/1-4.htm">Job 1:4</a>, in perff.; the chief fact follows, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/1-5.htm">Job 1:5</a>, in fut. consec. The perff. describe, according to Ges. 126, 3, that which has happened repeatedly in the past, as e.g., <a href="/ruth/4-7.htm">Ruth 4:7</a>; the fut. consec. the customary act of Job, in conjunction with this occurrence. The consecutio temporum is exactly like <a href="/1_samuel/1-3.htm">1 Samuel 1:3</a>.<p>It is questionable whether &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; is a distinct adverbial expression, in domu unuiscujusque, and &#1497;&#1493;&#1502;&#1493; also distinct, die ejus (Hirz. and others); or whether the three words are only one adverbial expression, in domo ejus cujus dies erat, which latter we prefer. At all events, &#1497;&#1493;&#1502;&#1493; here, in this connection, is not, with Hahn, Schlottm., and others, to be understood of the birthday, as <a href="/job/3-1.htm">Job 3:1</a>. The text, understood simply as it stands, speaks of a weekly round (Oehler and others). The seven sons took it in turn to dine with one another the week round, and did not forget their sisters in the loneliness of the parental home, but added them to their number. There existed among them a family peace and union which had been uninterruptedly cherished; but early on the morning of every eighth day, Job instituted a solemn service for his family, and offered sacrifices for his ten children, that they might obtain forgiveness for any sins of frivolity into which they might have fallen in the midst of the mirth of their family gatherings.<p>The writer might have represented this celebration on the evening of every seventh day, but he avoids even the slightest reference to anything Israelitish: for there is no mention in Scripture of any celebration of the Sabbath before the time of Israel. The sacred observance of the Sabbath, which was consecrated by God the Creator, was first expressly enjoined by the Sinaitic Thora. Here the family celebration falls on the morning of the Sunday, - a remarkable prelude to the New Testament celebration of Sunday in the age before the giving of the law, which is a type of the New Testament time after the law. The fact that Job, as father of the family, is the Cohen of his house, - a right of priesthood which the fathers of Israel exercised at the first passover (&#1502;&#1510;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1508;&#1505;&#1495;), and from which a relic is still retained in the annual celebration of the passover (&#1492;&#1491;&#1493;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; &#1508;&#1505;&#1495;), - is also characteristic of the age prior to the law. The standpoint of this age is also further faithfully preserved in this particular, that &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492; here, as also <a href="//biblehub.com/job/42-8.htm">Job 42:8</a>, appears distinctly as an expiatory offering; whilst in the Mosaic ritual, although it still indeed serves &#1500;&#1499;&#1508;&#1512; (<a href="/leviticus/1-4.htm">Leviticus 1:4</a>), as does every blood-offering, the idea of expiation as its peculiar intention is transferred to &#1492;&#1496;&#1488;&#1514; and &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501;. Neither of these forms of expiatory offering is here mentioned. The blood-offering still bears its most general generic name, &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492;, which it received after the flood. This name indicates that the offering is one which, being consumed by fire, is designed to ascend in flames and smoke. &#1492;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492; refers not so much to bringing it up to the raised altar, as to causing it to rise in flame and smoke, causing it to ascend to God, who is above. &#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; is the outward cleansing and the spiritual preparation for the celebration of the sacred festival, as <a href="/exodus/19-14.htm">Exodus 19:14</a>. It is scarcely necessary to remark, that the masculine suffixes refer also to the daughters. There were ten whole sacrifices offered by Job on each opening day of the weekly round, at the dawn of the Sunday; and one has therefore to imagine this round of entertainment as beginning with the first-born on the first day of the week. "Perhaps," says Job, "my children have sinned, and bidden farewell to God in their hearts." Undoubtedly, &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; signifies elsewhere (<a href="/1_kings/21-10.htm">1 Kings 21:10</a>; <a href="/psalms/10-3.htm">Psalm 10:3</a>), according to a so-called &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;, maledicere. This signification also suits <a href="//biblehub.com/job/2-5.htm">Job 2:5</a>, but does not at all suit <a href="/job/2-9.htm">Job 2:9</a>. This latter passage supports the signification valedicere, which arises from the custom of pronouncing a benediction or benedictory salutation at parting (e.g., <a href="/genesis/47-10.htm">Genesis 47:10</a>). Job is afraid lest his children may have become somewhat unmindful of God during their mirthful gatherings. In Job's family, therefore, there was an earnest desire for sanctification, which was far from being satisfied with mere outward propriety of conduct. Sacrifice (which is as old as the sin of mankind) was to Job a means of grace, by which he cleansed himself and his family every week from inward blemish. The futt. consec. are followed by perff., which are governed by them. &#1499;&#1468;&#1499;&#1492;, however, is followed by the fut., because in historical connection (cf. on the other hand, <a href="/numbers/8-26.htm">Numbers 8:26</a>), in the signification, faciebat h.e. facere solebat (Ges. 127, 4, b). Thus Job did every day, i.e., continually. As head of the family, he faithfully discharged his priestly vocation, which permitted him to offer sacrifice as an early Gentile servant of God. The writer has now made us acquainted with the chief person of the history which he is about to record, and in <a href="/job/1-6.htm">Job 1:6</a> begins the history itself. </body></html>
