And there came down fire from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.">2Kings 1:10-14</a>.) It is characteristic of the Old Testament poetry to see in the convulsions of nature the immediate action of the Most High; but perhaps it is intended throughout Job that we should see more than this, as the book undoubtedly assumes to be the record of a Divine revelation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/job/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/job/1-16.htm" title="While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and has burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell you.">Job 1:16</a></span>. <span class="ital">While he was yet speaking — </span>Before the former had done speaking, or Job could have time to compose his disturbed mind, and to digest his former loss; <span class="ital">there came also another — </span>Another messenger of evil tidings; <span class="ital">and said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven — </span>Not ordinary lightning, which could scarcely have destroyed seven thousand sheep at once; but an extraordinary, terrible, and widely-spreading flame or fire, issuing from the air, accompanied, probably, by a dreadful storm of thunder and hail, such as that recorded Exodus 9., which destroyed both man and beast that were left without shelter in the field; or that which destroyed the army of the confederate kings, <a href="/joshua/10-11.htm" title="And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, and were in the going down to Bethhoron, that the LORD cast down great stones from heaven on them to Azekah, and they died: they were more which died with hailstones than they whom the children of Israel slew with the sword.">Joshua 10:11</a>.

His dearest and most valuable possessions were his ten children; news is brought him that they are killed. They were taken away when he had most need of them to comfort him under other losses.

The. object seems to have been to give him no time to recover from the shock of one form of trial before another came upon him. If an interval had been given him he might have rallied his strength to bear his trials; but afflictions are much more difficult to be borne when they come in rapid succession. - It is not a very uncommon occurrence, however, that the righteous are tried by the rapidity and accumulation as well as the severity of their afflictions. It has passed into a proverb that "afflictions do not come alone."<p>The fire of God. - Margin, "A great fire;" evidently meaning a flash of lightning, or a thunderbolt. The Hebrew is "fire of God;" but it is probable that the phrase is used in a sense similar to the expression, "cedars of God," meaning lofty cedars; I or "mountains of God," meaning very high mountains. The lightning is I probably intended; compare <a href="/numbers/16-35.htm">Numbers 16:35</a>; see the note at <a href="/isaiah/29-6.htm">Isaiah 29:6</a>.<p>From heaven - From the sky, or the air.

Another messenger, one of Job's servants, from another part of his fields where his sheep were grazing, and was one of those that kept them; he came with another piece of bad news, even before the other had finished his whole account; and the same is observed of all the other messengers that follow: so Satan ordered it, that all Job's afflictions should come upon him at once, and the news of them be brought him as thick and as fast as they could, to surprise him the more into some rash expressions against God; that he might have no intermission, no breathing time; no time for prayer to God to support him under the affliction, and sanctify it unto him; no time for meditation upon, or recollection of, past experiences of divine goodness, or of promises that might have been useful to him; but they came one upon the back of another, to hurry him into some indecent carriage and behaviour towards God, being considered by him as his judgments upon him: <p>and said, the fire of God is fallen from heaven; which the servant thought, or Satan put it into his mind to say, that it came immediately from God, like that which destroyed Nadab and Abihu and the murmurers in the camp of Israel, <a href="/leviticus/10-2.htm">Leviticus 10:2</a> or, as it is commonly thought, is so called, because a most vehement one, as a vehement flame is called the flame of the Lord, Sol 8:6 this being such a fire as was never known, since the fire that came down from heaven and destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities of the plain. I am inclined to think it was a prodigious flash or flashes of lightning; for as thunder is the voice of God, so lightning, which accompanies it, may be called the fire of God; and this agrees with the phraseology of the passage; it comes from heaven, or the air, and falls upon the earth, and strikes creatures and things in it; and which, as it is the effect of natural causes, Satan might be permitted to join them together and effect it; and this was done, and the news of it expressed in such language as to make Job believe that God was against him, and become his enemy, and that the artillery of heaven was employed to his harm, and to the ruin of his substance: <p>and hath burnt up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; as the fire or lightning which came down from heaven and consumed the captains, and their fifties, in Elijah's time, <a href="/2_kings/1-10.htm">2 Kings 1:10</a> and such like effects of lightning are often to be observed, both with respect to men and cattle; these were the 7000 sheep Job was possessed of, <a href="/job/1-3.htm">Job 1:3</a> and which were all destroyed at once, with the servants that kept them, excepting one; creatures very productive and very useful both for food and clothing, and also used for sacrifice; and it is thought that Satan's end in the destruction of these was, that Job might conclude from hence that his sacrifices were not acceptable to God, and therefore it was in vain to serve him; which he hoped by this means to bring him to express in a passionate manner to God: <p>and I only am escaped alone to tell thee; See Gill on <a href="/job/1-15.htm">Job 1:15</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">While he <i>was</i> yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The <span class="cverse3">{y}</span> fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</span><p>(y) Which was also done by the craft of Satan, to tempt Job even more grievously, so he might see that not only men were his enemies, but that God made war against him.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/job/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">16</span>.

This Satan, under permission, might wield, as being "the prince of the power of the air" (<a href="/ephesians/2-2.htm">Ephesians 2:2</a>): but there is, no doubt, something very extraordinary in a storm extending over the pastures occupied by nine thousand sheep, and destroying the whole of them (Cook)  Still, it cannot be said that such a storm is impossible; and perhaps the damage done was not greater than that which followed on the seventh Egyptian plague (see <a href="/exodus/9-18.htm">Exodus 9:18-26</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And hath burned up the sheep, and the servants</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the young men</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the shepherds who were in attendance upon the sheep. <span class="cmt_word">And consumed them</span>; literally, <span class="accented">devoured them.</span> Fire is often said to "devour" what it destroys.

Hast Thou not made a hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? Hast Thou not blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land? But put forth Thine hand now, and touch all that he hath: truly he will renounce Thee to Thy face.<p>Satan is, according to the <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/12-10.htm">Revelation 12:10</a>, the &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3c1; who accuses the servants of God day and night before God. It is a fact respecting the invisible world, though expressed in the language and imagery of this world. So long as he is not finally vanquished and condemned, he has access to God, and thinks to justify himself by denying the truth of the existence and the possibility of the continuance of all piety. God permits it; for since everything happening to the creature is placed under the law of free development, evil in the world of spirits is also free to maintain and expand itself, until a spiritual power comes forward against it, by which the hitherto wavering conflict between the principles of good and evil is decided. This is the truth contained in the poetic description of the heavenly scene, sadly mistaken by Umbreit in his Essay on Sin, 1853, in which he explains Satan, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/109-6.htm">Psalm 109:6</a>, as a creation of our author's fancy. The paucity of the declarations respecting Satan in the Old Testament has misled him. And indeed the historical advance from the Old Testament to the New, though in itself well authorized, has in many ways of late induced to the levelling of the heights and depths of the New Testament. Formerly Umbreit was of the opinion, as many are still, that the idea of Satan is derived from Persia; but between Ahriman (Angramainyus) and Satan there is no striking resemblance;<p>(Note: Moreover, it is still questionable whether the form of the ancient doctrine of fire-worship among the Persians did not result from Jewish influences. Vid., Stuhr, Religionssysteme der herdn. Vlker des Orients, S. 373-75.)<p>whereas Diestel, in his Abh. ber Set-Typhon, Asasel und Satan, Stud. u. Krit., 1860, 2, cannot indeed recognise any connection between &#1506;&#1494;&#1488;&#1494;&#1500; and the Satan of the book of Job, but maintains a more complete harmony in all substantial marks between the latter and the Egyptian Typhon, and infers that "to Satan is therefore to be denied a purely Israelitish originality, the natural outgrowth of the Hebrew mind. It is indeed no special honour for Israel to be able to call him their own. He never has taken firm hold on the Hebrew consciousness." But how should it be no honour for Israel, the people to whom the revelation of redemption was made, and in whose history the plan of redemption was developed, to have traced the poisonous stream of evil up to the fountain of its first free beginning in the spiritual world, and to have more than superficially understood the history of the fall of mankind by sin, which points to a disguised superhuman power, opposed to the divine will? This perception undoubtedly only begins gradually to dawn in the Old Testament; but in the New Testament, the abyss of evil is fully disclosed, and Satan has so far a hold on the consciousness of Jesus, that He regards His life's vocation as a conflict with Satan. And the Protevangelium is deciphered in facts, when the promised seed of the woman crushed the serpent's head, but at the same time suffered the bruising of its own heel.<p>The view (e.g., Lutz in his Biblishce Dogmatik) that Satan as he is represented in the book of Job is not the later evil spirit, is to be rejected: he appears here only first, say Herder and Eichhorn, as impartial executor of judgment, and overseer of morality, commissioned by God. But he denies what God affirms, acknowledges no love towards God in the world which is not rooted in self-love, and is determined to destroy this love as a mere semblance. Where piety is dulled, he rejoices in its obscurity; where it is not, he dims its lustre by reflecting his own egotistical nature therein. Thus it is in <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/3-1.htm">Zechariah 3:1-10</a>, and so here. Genuine love loves God &#1495;&#1504;&#1468;&#1501; (adverb from &#1495;&#1503;, like gratis from gratia): it loves Him for His own sake; it is a relation of person to person, without any actual stipulations and claim. But Job does not thus fear God; &#1497;&#1512;&#1488; is here praet., whereas in <a href="/job/1-1.htm">Job 1:1</a> and <a href="/job/1-8.htm">Job 1:8</a> it is the adjective. God has indeed hitherto screened him from all evil; &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1514;&#1468; from &#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498;, sepire, and &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1491; (&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1491;) composed of &#1489;&#1468; and &#1506;&#1491;, in the primary signification circum, since &#1506;&#1491; expresses that the one joins itself to the other, and &#1489;&#1468; that it covers it, or covers itself with it. By the addition of &#1502;&#1505;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489;, the idea of the triple &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1491; is still strengthened. &#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;, lxx, Vulg., have translated by the plural, which is not false according to the thought; for &#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; &#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; is, especially in Deuteronomy, a favourite collective expression for human enterprise. &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1509;, a word, with the Sanskrito-Sem. frangere, related to &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1511;, signifying to break through the bounds, multiply and increase one's self unboundedly (<a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/30-30.htm">Genesis 30:30</a>, and freq.). The particle &#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1501;, proper only to the oldest and classic period, and very commonly used in the first four books of the Pentateuch, and in our book, generally &#1493;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1501;, is an emphatic "nevertheless;" Lat. (suited to this passage at least) verum enim vero. &#1488;&#1501;&#1470;&#1500;&#1488; is either, as frequently, a shortened formula of asseveration: May such and such happen to me if he do not, etc.,  equals  forsooth he will (lxx &#x3b7;&#787;&#834; &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;); or it is half a question: Attempt only this and this, whether he will not deny thee,  equals  annon, as <a href="/job/17-2.htm">Job 17:2</a>; <a href="/job/22-20.htm">Job 22:20</a>. The first perhaps suits the character of Satan better: he affirms that God is mistaken. &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; signifies here also, valedicere: he will say farewell to thee, and indeed &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1498; (as <a href="/isaiah/65-3.htm">Isaiah 65:3</a>), meeting thee arrogantly and shamelessly: it signifies, properly, upon thy countenance, i.e., say it to thee, to the very face, that he will have nothing more to do with thee (comp. on <a href="/job/2-5.htm">Job 2:5</a>). In order now that the truth of His testimony to Job's piety, and this piety itself, may be tried, Jehovah surrenders all Job's possessions, all that is his, except himself, to Satan. </body></html>
