Such is the uniform teaching of Scripture. We are not under the uncontrolled dominion of evil, strong as the temptation may be at times to think so. (See <a href="/2_corinthians/12-7.htm" title="And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.">2Corinthians 12:7</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm" title="And he said to me, My grace is sufficient for you: for my strength is made perfect in weakness.

It seems strange that God should give Satan such a permission as this. But he did it for his own glory, for the honour of Job, for the explanation of providence, and the encouragement of his afflicted people in all ages. <span class="ital">So Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord — </span>From the place where God is represented as having been especially present, glad of the permission he had obtained to do mischief to a good man; and resolved to lose no time, but immediately to put his project in execution.

There is an evil spirit, the enemy of God, and of all righteousness, who is continually seeking to distress, to lead astray, and, if possible, to destroy those who love God. How far his influence may extend, we cannot say; but probably much unsteadiness and unhappiness in Christians may be ascribed to him. While we are on this earth we are within his reach. Hence it concerns us to be sober and vigilant, 1Pe 5:8. See how Satan censures Job. This is the common way of slanderers, to suggest that which they have no reason to think is true. But as there is nothing we should dread more than really being hypocrites, so there is nothing we need dread less than being called and counted so without cause. It is not wrong to look at the eternal recompence in our obedience; but it is wrong to aim at worldly advantages in our religion. God's people are taken under his special protection; they, and all that belong to them. The blessing of the Lord makes rich; Satan himself owns it. God suffered Job to be tried, as he suffered Peter to be sifted. It is our comfort that God has the devil in a chain, Re 20:1. He has no power to lead men to sin, but what they give him themselves; nor any power to afflict men, but what is given him from above. All this is here described to us after the manner of men. The Scripture speaks thus to teach us that God directs the affairs of the world.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>All that he hath is in thy power - Margin, as in Hebrew "hand." That is, all this is now committed to thee, for it is manifest that hitherto Satan had no power to injure even his property. He complained that God had made a hedge around all that Job possessed. Now it was all entrusted to him in order that he might make full trim of the faith of Job. The grant extended to his sons and daughters as well as to his property.<p>Only upon himself put not forth thine hand - Job himself was not to be visited with sickness nor was his life to be taken. The main accusation of Satan was, that Job was virtuous only because God encompassed him with so many blessings, and especially because he had endowed him with so much property. The trial, therefore, only required that it should be seen whether his piety was the mere result of these blessings.<p>So Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord - That is from the council which had been convened; see the notes at <a href="/job/1-6.htm">Job 1:6</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. in thy power&#8212;Satan has no power against man till God gives it.

This he said not as angry and displeased with Job, or as entertaining any ill opinion of him through the suggestions of Satan, nor as gratifying that evil spirit; but in order to convince and confound him, and to try the grace of Job, that he might shine the brighter; and it may be observed, that the Lord alone had the sovereign dispose of all that Job had, and that Satan could have no power over him or his, but what was given him: <p>only upon himself put not forth thine hand; thus the Lord restrained Satan, who could do nothing without his leave, and limits and bounds the present affliction of his servant to his family and estate; reserving his person and the health of it for another temptation and trial: <p>so Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord; the Targum adds, "with power", authority, liberty of acting; not from his general presence, which is everywhere, from whence there is no going; nor from his gracious presence, in which he had not been; and much less his glorious presence in heaven, from whence he had been cast long ago; but from the place where the sons and people of God worshipped, and where he granted his presence to them, and from conversing with God there: as soon as Satan had got leave, he at once went forth to execute what he had permission to do, glad at heart he had so far succeeded; and eager upon doing all the mischief he could to a man that was the butt of his malice, and the object of his envy and hatred; the sad effects and consequences of which follow. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath <i>is</i> in <span class="cverse3">{t}</span> thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand.

God withdraws his protection from Job's possessions; he does not himself take them away, as Satan had suggested (ver. 11); but he allows Satan, who can do nothing without his allowance, to deal with them as he pleases. As God dispenses blessings through the angelic host (<a href="/psalms/91-11.htm">Psalm 91:11, 12</a>; <a href="/hebrews/1-14.htm">Hebrews 1:14</a>), so he, sometimes at any rate, allows spirits of evil to be the ministers of his chastisements. <span class="cmt_word">Only upon himself put not forth thine hand</span>.

The article is used in the opposite manner here, because the narrator in thought connects the day with the following occurrence; and this frees it from absolute indefiniteness: the western mode of expression is different. From the writer assigning the earthly measure of time to the place of God and spirits, we see that celestial things are represented by him parabolically. But the assumptions on which he proceeds are everywhere recognised in Scripture; for (1.) &#1492;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;, as the name of the celestial spirits, is also found out of the book of Job (<a href="/genesis/6-2.htm">Genesis 6:2</a>; cf. <a href="/psalms/29-1.htm">Psalm 29:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/59-7.htm">Psalm 59:7</a>; <a href="/daniel/3-25.htm">Daniel 3:25</a>). They are so called, as beings in the likeness of God, which came forth from God in the earliest beginning of creation, before this material world and man came into existence (<a href="//biblehub.com/job/28-4.htm">Job 28:4-7</a>): the designation &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; points to the particular manner of their creation. (2.) Further, it is the teaching of Scripture, that these are the nearest attendants upon God, the nearest created glory, with which He has surrounded himself in His eternal glory, and that He uses them as the immediate instruments of His cosmical rule. This representation underlies <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/1-26.htm">Genesis 1:26</a>, which Philo correctly explains, &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3c1; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;; and in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/59-6.htm">Psalm 59:6-8</a>, a psalm which is closely allied to the book of Job, &#1511;&#1492;&#1500; and &#1505;&#1493;&#1491;, of the holy ones, is just the assembly of the heavenly spirits, from which, as &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; of God, they go forth into the universe and among men. (3.) It is also further the teaching of Scripture, that one of these spirits has withdrawn himself from the love of God, has reversed the truth of his bright existence, and in sullen ardent self-love is become the enemy of God, and everything godlike in the creature. This spirit is called, in reference to God and the creature, &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1496;&#1503; ,er, from the verb &#1513;&#1474;&#1496;&#1503;, to come in the way, oppose, treat with enmity, - a name which occurs first here, and except here occurs only in <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/3-1.htm">Zechariah 3:1-10</a> and <a href="/1_chronicles/21-1.htm">1 Chronicles 21:1</a>. Since the Chokma turned, with a decided preference, to the earliest records of the world and mankind before the rise of nationalities, it must have known the existence of this God-opposing spirit from <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/2.htm">Genesis 2</a>f. The frequent occurrence of the tree of life and the way of life in the Salomonic Proverbs, shows how earnestly the research of that time was engaged with the history of Paradise: so that it cannot be surprising that it coined the name &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1496;&#1503; for that evil spirit. (4.) Finally, it agrees with <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/22-19.htm">1 Kings 22:19-22</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/3-1.htm">Zechariah 3:1</a>, on the one hand, and <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/12.htm">Revelation 12</a> on the other, that Satan here appears still among the good spirits, resembling Judas Iscariot among the disciples until his treachery was revealed. The work of redemption, about which his enmity to God overdid itself, and by which his damnation is perfected, is during the whole course of the Old Testament history incomplete.<p>Herder, Eichhorn, Lutz, Ewald, and Umbreit, see in this distinct placing of Satan in relation to the Deity and good spirits nothing but a change of representations arising from foreign influences; but if Jesus Christ is really the vanquisher of Satan, as He himself says, the realm of spirits must have a history, which is divided into two eras by this triumph. Moreover, both the Old and New Testaments agree herein, that Satan is God's adversary, and consequently altogether evil, and must notwithstanding serve God, since He makes even evil minister to His purpose of salvation, and the working out of His plan in the government of the world. This is the chief thought which underlies the further progress of the scene. The earthly elements of time, space, and dialogue, belong to the poetic drapery.<p>Instead of &#1506;&#1500; &#1492;&#1514;&#1497;&#1510;&#1468;&#1489;, &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497; is used elsewhere (<a href="/proverbs/22-29.htm">Proverbs 22:29</a>): &#1506;&#1500; is a usage of language derived from the optical illusion to the one who is in the foreground seeming to surpass the one in the background. It is an assembly day in heaven. All the spirits present themselves to render their account, and expecting to receive commands; and the following dialogue ensues between Jehovah and Satan: -  </body></html>
