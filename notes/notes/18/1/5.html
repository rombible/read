Thus, what is called cursing one’s father or mother, <a href="/exodus/21-17.htm" title="And he that curses his father, or his mother, shall surely be put to death.">Exodus 21:17</a>, is elsewhere called setting light by them, as <a href="/deuteronomy/27-16.htm" title="Cursed be he that sets light by his father or his mother.

It has been thought by some, that it was substituted instead of the word <span class="greekheb">ארר</span>, <span class="ital">arar; </span><span class="greekheb">קבב</span>, <span class="ital">ka-bab; </span>or <span class="greekheb">קלל</span>, <span class="ital">kalal, </span>(one or other of which is usually put for <span class="ital">cursing, </span>or <span class="ital">vilifying,</span>) out of reverence for God, when he is spoken of. But, “It is most certain,” says Selden, as quoted by Leigh, “that the verb <span class="ital">barak </span>signifies to <span class="ital">execrate </span>or to <span class="ital">curse, </span>as well as to <span class="ital">bless; </span>and this, as I think, not by <span class="ital">antiphrasis, </span>as some will have it; but almost from the very idiom of the sacred language it may signify either way, according to the connection in which it is used, as among the Latins <span class="ital">sacrare </span>and <span class="ital">imprecari. </span>For as the first signifies sometimes to devote any one by curses to destruction, and at others, to consecrate any thing to God; and as we call for either good or evil upon others; so <span class="ital">barak </span>denotes what a man wishes or calls for, with an ardent mind, whether it be salvation or perdition. And when applied to the Deity, it either signifies addressing him by praises and thanksgivings, (which is more common,) or with revilings and reproaches; and the difference is to be collected from the nature of the case and from the context.” What Dr. Dodd observes here is also worth attention. “The Hebrew word,” says he, “signifies <span class="ital">to bless; </span>but it here implies to <span class="ital">renounce </span>or <span class="ital">bid adieu to, </span>or take our leave of those things which we abandon or renounce. It is therefore used with great elegance in this sense, to signify, <span class="ital">they renounced God; </span>and this signification is still softened and rendered more elegant by the addition of the words, <span class="ital">in their hearts.” Thus did Job continually </span>— It was his constant course, at the end of every feasting-time, to offer a sacrifice for each of his children. Parents should be particular in their addresses to God, for the several branches of their family; praying for each child, according to his particular temper, genius, and disposition.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/job/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:1-5 Job was prosperous, and yet pious. Though it is hard and rare, it is not impossible for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven. By God's grace the temptations of worldly wealth may be overcome. The account of Job's piety and prosperity comes before the history of his great afflictions, showing that neither will secure from troubles. While Job beheld the harmony and comforts of his sons with satisfaction, his knowledge of the human heart made him fearful for them. He sent and sanctified them, reminding them to examine themselves, to confess their sins, to seek forgiveness; and as one who hoped for acceptance with God through the promised Saviour, he offered a burnt-offering for each. We perceive his care for their souls, his knowledge of the sinful state of man, his entire dependence on God's mercy in the way he had appointed.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about - Dr. Good renders this, "as the days of such banquets returned." But this is not the idea intended. It is, when the banquets had gone round as in a circle through all the families, "then" Job sent and sanctified them. It was not from an anticipation that they "would" do wrong, but it was from the apprehension that they "might" have sinned. The word rendered "were gone about" (&#1504;&#1511;&#1507;  na&#770;qaph) means properly to join together, and then to move round in a circle, to revolve, as festivals do; see the notes at <a href="/isaiah/29-1.htm">Isaiah 29:1</a> : "Let the festivals go round." Here it means that the days of their banqueting had gone round the circle, or had gone round the several families. Septuagint "When the days of the entertainment (or drinking, &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;  potou) were finished." A custom of feasting similar to this prevails in China. "They have their fraternities which they call the brotherhood of the months; this consists of months according to the number of the days therein, and in a circle they go abroad to eat at one another's houses by turns. If one man has not conveniences to receive the fraternity in his own house, he may provide for them in another; and there are many public houses well furnished for this purpose." See Semedo's History of China, i chapter 13, as quoted by Burder in Rosenmuller's Morgenland. "in loc."<p>That Job sent - Sent for them, and called them around him. He was apprehensive that they might have erred, and he took every measure to keep them pure, and to maintain the influence of religion in his family.<p>And sanctified them - This expression, says Schultens, is capable of two interpretations. It may either mean that he "prepared" them by various lustrations, ablutions, and other ceremonies to offer sacrifice; or that he offered sacrifices for the purpose of procuring expiation for sins which they might actually have committed. The former sense, he remarks, is favored by the use of the word in <a href="/exodus/19-10.htm">Exodus 19:10</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-5.htm">1 Samuel 16:5</a>, where the word means to prepare themselves by ablutions to meet God and to worship him. The latter sense is demanded by the connection. Job felt as every father should feel in such circumstances, that there was reason to fear that God had not been remembered as he ought to have been, and he was therefore more fervent in his devotions, and called them around him, that their own minds might be affected in view of his pious solicitude. What father is there who loves God, and who feels anxious that his children should also, who does not feel special solicitude if his sons and his daughters are in a situation where successive days are devoted to feasting and mirth? The word here rendered "sanctified" (&#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;  qa&#770;dash) means properly to be pure, clean, holy; in Pihel, the form used here, to make holy, to sanctify, to consecrate, as a priest; and here it means, that he took measures to make them holy on the apprehension that they had sinned; that is, he took the usual means to procure for them forgiveness. The Septuagint renders it &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;  ekatharizen, he purified them.<p>And rose up early in the morning - For the purpose of offering his devotions, and procuring for them expiation. It was customary in the patriarchal times to offer sacrifice early in the morning. See <a href="/genesis/22-3.htm">Genesis 22:3</a>; <a href="/exodus/32-6.htm">Exodus 32:6</a>.<p>And offered burnt-offerings - Hebrew "and caused to ascend;" that is, by burning them so that the smoke ascended toward heaven. The word rendered "burnt-offerings" (&#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492;  &#8219;o&#770;la&#770;h) is from &#1506;&#1500;&#1492;  &#8219;a&#770;la&#770;h, "to ascend" (the word used here and rendered "offered"), and means that which was made to ascend, to wit, by burning. It is applied in the Scriptures to a sacrifice that was wholly consumed on the altar, and answers to the Greek word &#x3bf;&#788;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  holokauston, "Holocaust." See the notes at <a href="/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11</a>. Such offerings in the patriarchal times were made by the father of a family, officiating as priest in behalf of his household. Thus, Noah officiated, <a href="/genesis/8-20.htm">Genesis 8:20</a>; and thus also Abraham acted as the priest to offer sacrifice, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7-8</a>; <a href="/genesis/13-18.htm">Genesis 13:18</a>; <a href="/genesis/22-13.htm">Genesis 22:13</a>. In the earliest times, and among pagan nations, it was supposed that pardon might be procured for sin by offering sacrifice. In Homer there is a passage which remarkably corresponds with the view of Job before us; Iliad 9:493:<p>The gods (the great and only wise)<p>Are moved by offerings, vows, and sacrifice;<p>Offending man their high compassion wins,<p>And daily prayers atone for daily sins.<p>Pope<p>According to the number of them all - Sons and daughters. Perhaps an additional sacrifice for each one of them. The Septuagint renders this, "according to their numbers, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#788;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1; &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;  kai moschon hena peri hamartias peri to&#772;n psucho&#772;n auto&#772;n - a young bullock for sin or a sin-offering for their souls."<p>It may be that my sons have sinned - He had no positive or certain proof of it. He felt only the natural apprehension which every pious father must, that his sons might have been overtaken by temptation, and perhaps, under the influence of wine, might have been led to speak reproachfully of God, and of the necessary restraints of true religion and virtue.<p>And cursed God in their hearts - The word here rendered curse is that which is usually rendered "bless" &#1489;&#1512;&#1498;  ba&#772;rak. It is not a little remarkable that the same word is used in senses so directly opposite as to "bless" and "to curse." Dr. Good contends that the word should be always rendered "bless," and so translates it in this place, "peradventure my sons may have sinned, "nor" blessed God in their hearts," understanding the Hebrew prefix &#1493;  (v) as a disjunctive or negative participle. So too in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/2-9.htm">Job 2:9</a>, rendered in our common translation, "curse God and die," he translates it, "blessing God and dying." But the interpretation which the connection demands is evidently that of cursing, renouncing, or forgetting; and so also it is in <a href="/job/2-9.htm">Job 2:9</a>. This sense is still more obvious in <a href="/1_kings/21-10.htm">1 Kings 21:10</a> : "Thou didst "blaspheme" &#1489;&#1512;&#1498;  ba&#772;rak God and the king." So also <a href="/1_kings/21-13.htm">1 Kings 21:13</a> of the same chapter - though here Dr. Good contends that the word should be rendered "bless," and that the accusation was that Naboth "blessed" or worshipped the gods, even Moloch - where he supposes the word &#1502;&#1500;&#1498;  melek, should be pointed &#1502;&#1500;&#1498;  mo&#770;lek and read "Molech." But the difficulty is not removed by this, and after all it is probable that the word here, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/2-9.htm">Job 2:9</a>, means to "curse." So it is understood by nearly all interpreters. The Vulgate indeed renders it singularly enough, "Lest perhaps my sons have sinned, and have blessed God (et benedixerint Deo) in their hearts." The Septuagint, "Lest perhaps my sons in their mind have thought evil toward God" - &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;  kaka enenoe&#772;san pros Theon. The Chaldee, "Lest my sons have sinned and provoked yahweh (&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1493;&#1488;&#1512;&#1490;&#1497;&#1494;&#1491;&#1511;&#1491;&#1501;) in their hearts." Assuming that this is the sense of the word here, there are three ways of accounting for the fact that the same word should have such opposite significations.<p>(1) One is that proposed by Taylor (Concor.), that pious persons of old regarded blasphemy as so abominable that they abhorred to express it by the proper name, and that therefore by an "euphemism" they used the term "bless" instead of "curse." But it should be said that nothing is more common in the Scriptures than words denoting cursing and blasphemy. The word &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;  'a&#770;la&#770;h, in the sense of cursing or execrating, occurs frequently. So the word &#1490;&#1491;&#1507;  ga&#770;daph, means to blaspheme, and is often used; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/19-6.htm">2 Kings 19:6</a>, <a href="/2_kings/19-22.htm">2 Kings 19:22</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/37-6.htm">Isaiah 37:6</a>, <a href="/isaiah/37-23.htm">Isaiah 37:23</a>; <a href="/psalms/44-16.htm">Psalm 44:16</a>. Other words also were used in the same sense, and there was no necessity of using a mere "euphemism" here.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. when the days of their feasting were gone about&#8212;that is, at the end of all the birthdays collectively, when the banquets had gone round through all the families.<p>Job &#8230; sanctified&#8212;by offering up as many expiatory burnt offerings as he had sons (Le 1:4). This was done "in the morning" (Ge 22:3; Le 6:12). Jesus also began devotions early (Mr 1:35). The holocaust, or burnt offering, in patriarchal times, was offered (literally, "caused to ascend," referring to the smoke ascending to heaven) by each father of a family officiating as priest in behalf of his household.<p>cursed God&#8212;The same Hebrew word means to "curse," and to "bless"; Gesenius says, the original sense is to "kneel," and thus it came to mean bending the knee in order to invoke either a blessing or a curse. Cursing is a perversion of blessing, as all sin is of goodness. Sin is a degeneracy, not a generation. It is not, however, likely that Job should fear the possibility of his sons cursing God. The sense "bid farewell to," derived from the blessing customary at parting, seems sufficient (Ge 47:10). Thus Umbreit translates "may have dismissed God from their hearts"; namely, amid the intoxication of pleasure (Pr 20:1). This act illustrates Job's "fear of God" (Job 1:1).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/job/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">When the days of their feasting were gone about; </span> when each of them had had his turn, which peradventure came speedily, though not immediately one after another; and there was some considerable interval before their next feasting time. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Job sent and sanctified them, </span> i.e. he exhorted and commanded them to sanctify themselves for the following work, to wit, by purifying themselves from all ceremonial and moral pollution, as the manner then was, <span class="bld"><a href="/exodus/19-10.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Go to the people, and sanctify them to day and to morrow, and let them wash their clothes,">Exodus 19:10</a></span>, and by preparing themselves by true repentance for all their sins, and particularly such as they had committed in their time of feasting and jollity, and by fervent prayers to make their peace with God by sacrifice. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Rose up early in the morning; </span> thereby showing his ardent zeal in God’s service, and his impatience till God was reconciled to him and to his children. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">It may be that my sons have sinned:</span> his zeal for God’s glory, and his true love to his children, made him jealous; for which he had cause enough from the corruption of man’s nature, the frailty and folly of youth, the many temptations which attend upon feasting and jollity, and the easiness of sliding from lawful to forbidden delights. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And cursed God; </span> not in the grossest manner and highest degree, which it is not probable either that they should do, now especially when they had no provocation to do it, as being surrounded with blessings and comforts which they were actually enjoying, and not yet exercised with any affliction, or that Job should suspect it concerning them; but <span class="ital">despised</span> and <span class="ital">dishonoured</span> God; for both Hebrew and Greek words signifying cursing, are sometimes used to note only reviling, or detracting, or speaking evil, or setting light by a person.

When they had been at each other's houses in turn; when the rotation was ended: something like this is practised by the Chinese, who have their co-fraternities, which they call "the brotherhood of the month"; this consists of thirty, according to the number of days therein, and in a circle they go every day to eat at one another's house by turns; if one man has not convenience to receive the fraternity in his own house, he may provide it at another man's, and there are many public houses very well furnished for this purpose (e): Job's sons probably began at the elder brother's house, and so went on according to their age, and ended with the younger brother; so when they had gone through the circuit, as the word (f) signifies, and the revolution was over, and they had done feasting for that season, or that year: <p>that Job sent and sanctified them; not that he did or could make them holy, by imparting grace, or infusing holiness into them; at most he could only pray for their sanctification, and give them rules, precepts, and instructions about holiness, and exhortations to it; but here it signifies, that being at some distance from them he sent messengers or letters to them to sanctify and prepare themselves for the sacrifices he was about to offer for them; either by some rites and ceremonies, as by washing themselves, and abstinence from their wives, which were sometimes used as preparatory to divine service, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/35-2.htm">Genesis 35:2</a>, or by fasting and prayer; or, perhaps, no more is intended by it than an invitation of them to come and attend the solemn sacrifice which he, as the head of the family, would offer for them; so, to sanctify people, is sometimes to invite, to call and gather them to holy service, see <a href="/joel/2-15.htm">Joel 2:15</a> and so the Targum renders it. "Job sent and invited them:" <p>and rose up early in the morning of the last of the days of feasting; he took the first opportunity, and that as early as he could; which shows the eagerness of his spirit for the glory of God, and the good of his children, losing no time for his devotion to God, and regard for his family; this being also the fittest time for religious worship and service, see <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/5-3.htm">Psalm 5:3</a>, and was used for sacrifice, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/29-39.htm">Exodus 29:39</a>, <p>and offered burnt offering according to the number of them all either of his ten children, or only his seven sons, since they only are next mentioned, and were the masters of the feast: this was before the law of the priesthood was in being, which restrained the offering of sacrifice to those in the office of priests, when, before, every head of a family had a right unto it; and this custom of offering sacrifice was before the law of Moses, it was of divine institution, and in use from the time of the fall of man, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/3-21.htm">Genesis 3:21</a>, and was by tradition handed down from one to another, and so Job had it; and which was typical of the sacrifice of Christ, to be offered up in the fulness of time for the expiation of sin; and Job, no doubt, by faith in Christ, offered up those burnt offerings for his sons, and one for each of them, thereby signifying, that everyone stood in need of the whole sacrifice of Christ for the atonement of sin, as every sinner does: <p>for Job said, it may be that my sons have sinned; not merely as in common, or daily sins of infirmity; for Job so full well knew the corruption of human nature, that a day could not pass without sin in thought, word, or deed; but some more notorious or scandalous sin; that, in the midst of their feasting and mirth, they had used some filthy, or frothy, and unsavoury and unbecoming language; had dropped some impure words, or impious jests, or done some actions which would reflect dishonour on God and true religion, and bring an odium on themselves and families: now Job was not certain of this, he had had no instruction or intelligence of it; he only surmised and conjectured it might be so; he was fearful and jealous lest it should: this shows his care and concern, as for the glory of God, so for the spiritual welfare of his children, though they were grown up and gone from him, and is to be considered in favour of his sons; for by this it is evident they were not addicted to any sin, or did not live a vicious course of life; but that they were religious and godly persons; or, otherwise Job would have had no doubt in his mind about their conduct and behaviour: the particular sin he feared they might have been guilty of follows: <p>and cursed God in their hearts; not in the grossest sense of the expression, so as to deny the being of God, and wish there was none, and conceive blasphemy in their hearts, and utter it with their lips; but whereas to bless God is to think and speak well of him, and ascribe that to him which is his due; so to curse him is to think and speak irreverently of him, and not to attribute to him what belongs unto him; and thus Job might fear that his sons, amidst their feasting, might boast of their plenty, and of the increase of their substance, and attribute it to their own diligence and industry, and not to the providence of God, of which he feared they might speak slightingly and unbecomingly, as persons in such circumstances sometimes do, see <a href="/deuteronomy/32-15.htm">Deuteronomy 32:15</a>. Mr. Broughton renders it, "and little blessed God in their hearts" not blessing him as they should was interpretatively cursing him; the Hebrew word used properly and primarily signifies to bless (g), and then the meaning is, either that his sons had sinned, but took no notice of it, nor were humbled for it, but blessed God, being prosperous and successful, as if they had never sinned at all, see <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/13-1.htm">Zechariah 13:1</a>, Sanctius adds the negative particle "not", as if the meaning was, that they sinned, and did not bless God for their mercies as they should, <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-10.htm">Deuteronomy 8:10</a>, but this is too daring and venturous to make such an addition; though this is favoured by the Targum, as in some copies, which paraphrases it, <p>and have not prayed in the name of the Lord in their hearts: and because the word is used at parting, and taking a farewell of friends, Cocceius thinks it may be so used here, and the sense to be, that they sinned, and took their leave of God, and departed from him; but rather, as the word Elohim is used of strange gods, of false deities, <a href="/exodus/18-11.htm">Exodus 18:11</a>. Job's fears might be, lest his sons should have been guilty of any idolatrous action, at least of blessing the gods of the Gentiles in their hearts, since feasting sometimes leads to idolatry, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/32-6.htm">Exodus 32:6</a>, but the first sense seems best, with which the Septuagint version agrees, <p>"it may be my sons in their mind have thought evil things against the Lord:'' <p>thus did Job continually; or "all those days" (h); that is, after every such circuit and rotation of feasting, or after every feast day kept by them, he offered sacrifices for them; or every year (i), as some interpret the phrase, the feasts, and so the sacrifices, being annual; all this is observed, partly further to describe the piety of Job, his affection for his family, and concern for their spiritual good, and the glory of God, and partly as a leading step to an later event, <a href="/job/1-18.htm">Job 1:18</a>. <p>(e) Semedo's History of China, par. 1. c. 13.

As was customary in the Patriarchal age, to which Job belonged, and even far down in the history of Israel, the father was priest of the family, and the sacrifice offered was the burnt-offering.

His desire was to see his children happy, provided their happiness was innocent.

That Job sent and sanctified them. In the old world, outside the Mosaic Law, the father of the family was the priest, to whom alone it belonged to bless, purify, and offer sacrifice. Job, after each birthday-feast, sent, it would seem, for his sons, and purified them by the accustomed ablutions, or possibly by some other ceremonial process, regarding it as probable that, in the course of their feasting, they had contracted some defilement. It would seem by the next clause that the purification took place at the close of the day of festivity. <span class="cmt_word">And rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings</span>.

Two wholly different meanings are assigned by good Hebraists to the expression <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5d7;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>. According to some, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5e8;</span> has its usual sense, "to bless," and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5dc;&#x5d4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> signifies "false gods," or "idols;" according to the others, who form the great majority, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5dc;&#x5d4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> has its usual sense of "God," and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5e8;</span> has the unusual sense of "curse" (so Buxtorf, Rosenmuller, Schultens, (Cook, Stanley Leathes, among moderns, and among ancient authorities, the Septuagint and the Vulgate). How the same word comes to have the two wholly opposite senses of "to bless" and "to curse" has been differently explained. Some think that, as men blessed their friends both on receiving them and on bidding them adieu, the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5e8;</span> got the sense of "bidding adieu to," "dismissing," "renouncing." Others regard the use of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5e8;</span> for "to curse" as a mere euphemism, and compare the use of <span class="accented">sacer</span> and <span class="accented">sacrari</span> in Latin, and such expressions as "<span class="accented">Bless</span> the stupid man!" "What a <span class="accented">blessed</span> nuisance!" in English. The maledictory sense seems to be established by <a href="/job/2-9.htm">Job 2:9</a> and <a href="/1_kings/21-10.htm">1 Kings 21:10</a>. By "cursing God in their hearts" Job probably means "forgetting him," "putting him out of sight," "not giving him the honour which is his due." <span class="cmt_word">Thus did Job continually</span>; literally, as in the margin, <span class="accented">all the days</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> whenever one of the festival-days occurred. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/esther/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>And King Ahashverosh laid a tribute upon the land, and upon the isles of the sea. <a href="/esther/10-2.htm">Esther 10:2</a>. And all the acts of his power and of his might, and the statement of the greatness of Mordochai to which the king advanced him, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia? The Chethiv &#1488;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; is a clerical error for &#1488;&#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;. The word &#1502;&#1505;, service, here stands for tribute. As the provinces of the kingdom paid the imposts for the most part in natural produce, which they had reared or obtained by the labour of their hands, their labour (agriculture, cattle-keeping, etc.) was to a certain extent service rendered to the king. The matter of <a href="/esther/10-1.htm">Esther 10:1</a> seems extraneous to the contents of our book, which has hitherto communicated only such information concerning Ahashverosh as was necessary for the complete understanding of the feast of Purim. "It seems" - remarks Bertheau - "as thou the historian had intended to tell in some further particulars concerning the greatness of King Ahashverosh, for the sake of giving his readers a more accurate notion of the influential position and the agency of Mordochai, the hero of his book, who, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/esther/9-4.htm">Esther 9:4</a>, waxed greater and greater; but then gave up his intention, and contented himself with referring to the book of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia, which contained information of both the power and might of Ahashverosh and the greatness of Mordochai." There is not, however, the slightest probability in such a conjecture. This matter may be simply explained by the circumstance, that the author of this book was using as an authority the book of the chronicles alluded to in <a href="//biblehub.com/esther/10-2.htm">Esther 10:2</a>, and is quite analogous with the mode observed in the books of Kings and Chronicles by historians both of Babylonian and post-Babylonian days, who quote from the documents they make use of such events only as seem to them important with regard to the plan of their own work, and then at the close of each reign refer to the documents themselves, in which more may be found concerning the acts of the kings, at the same time frequently adding supplementary information from these sources, - comp. e.g., <a href="/1_kings/14-30.htm">1 Kings 14:30</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/15-7.htm">1 Kings 15:7</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/15-23.htm">1 Kings 15:23</a>, <a href="/1_kings/15-32.htm">1 Kings 15:32</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/22-47.htm">1 Kings 22:47-50</a>; <a href="/2_kings/15-37.htm">2 Kings 15:37</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-15.htm">2 Chronicles 12:15</a>, - with this difference only, that in these instances the supplementary notices follow the mention of the documents, while in the present book the notice precedes the citation. As, however, this book opened with a description of the power and glory of King Ahashverosh, but yet only mentioned so much concerning this ruler of 127 provinces as was connected with the history of the Jews, its author, before referring to his authorities, gives at its close the information contained in <a href="//biblehub.com/esther/10-1.htm">Esther 10:1</a>, from the book of the chronicles of the kingdom, in which probably it was connected with a particular description of the power and greatness of Ahashverosh, and probably of the wars in which he engaged, for the sake of briefly intimating at the conclusion whence the king derived the means for keeping up the splendour described at the commencement of the book. This book of the chronicles contained accounts not only of the power and might of Ahashverosh, but also a &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;, a plain statement or accurate representation of the greatness of Mordochai wherewith the king had made him great, i.e., to which he had advanced him, and therefore of the honours of the individual to whom the Jews were indebted for their preservation. On this account is it referred to. For Mordochai was next to the king, i.e., prime minister of the king (&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492;, comp. <a href="/2_chronicles/28-7.htm">2 Chronicles 28:7</a>), and great among the Jews and acceptable to the multitude of his brethren, i.e., he was also a great man among the Jews and was beloved and esteemed by all his fellow-countrymen (on &#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1497;, comp. <a href="/deuteronomy/23-24.htm">Deuteronomy 23:24</a>), seeking the good of his people and speaking peace to all his race. This description of Mordochai's position with respect both to the king and his own people has, as expressive of an exalted frame of mind, a rhetorical and poetic tinge. Hence it contains such expressions as &#1488;&#1495;&#1497;&#1493; &#1512;&#1489;, the fulness of his brethren, &#1496;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489; &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;; comp. <a href="/psalms/122-9.htm">Psalm 122:9</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/38-4.htm">Jeremiah 38:4</a>.
