The difficulty consists in this: <span class= "ital">the bars of the grave </span>are masculine, and the verb, <span class= "ital">they shall go down, </span>is feminine plural; it seems improbable that <span class= "ital">the bars of the grave </span>should be the subject of the verb (though perhaps not absolutely impossible); but if <span class= "ital">the bars of the grave </span>are the place to which the going down is, as in the Authorised Version, then what is the subject to the verb, go down, seeing that <span class= "ital">hope, </span>the apparent subject, is a feminine singular? Some render “it shall go down,” but this is in defiance of the grammar, though, probably, the meaning it conveys is not far from the truth. The words clearly express a condition of utter despair, and that Job’s only hope of rest is in the grave. It is a rule in Hebrew grammar that when the verb precedes its subject it need not agree with it in gender or number; but here the verb must, at all events, come after its subject, and consequently, it is very difficult to determine what that subject is. The only apparent subject is to be found in the <span class= "ital">corruption </span>of the <span class= "ital">worm </span>of <a href="/job/17-14.htm" title="I have said to corruption, You are my father: to the worm, You are my mother, and my sister.">Job 17:14</a>; but they, instead of going down to the grave, are already there.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/job/17.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/job/17-16.htm" title="They shall go down to the bars of the pit, when our rest together is in the dust.">Job 17:16</a></span>. <span class="ital">They shall go down to the bars of the pit — </span>They that would see my hope must go down into the grave, or rather into the invisible world, to behold it. Or, he means, My hope shall go down, of which he spake in the singular number, <a href="/job/17-15.htm" title="And where is now my hope? as for my hope, who shall see it?">Job 17:15</a>, and which he here changes into the plural, as is usual in these poetical books. Thus Houbigant renders this clause: <span class="ital">It, </span>namely, my hope, <span class="ital">shall descend together with me into the grave: it shall rest with me in the dust. </span>My hopes of temporal good are dying, and will be buried in my grave, where I and they, and I and my friends, shall lie together. Remember, reader, we must all shortly lie in the dust, under the bars of the pit; held fast there, till the general resurrection. And all good men, if, like Job and his friends, they cannot agree now, will there rest together. Let the foresight of this cool the heat of all contenders, and moderate the disputers of this world. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/job/17.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>17:10-16 Job's friends had pretended to comfort him with the hope of his return to a prosperous estate; he here shows that those do not go wisely about the work of comforting the afflicted, who fetch their comforts from the possibility of recovery in this world. It is our wisdom to comfort ourselves, and others, in distress, with that which will not fail; the promise of God, his love and grace, and a well-grounded hope of eternal life. See how Job reconciles himself to the grave. Let this make believers willing to die; it is but going to bed; they are weary, and it is time that they were in their beds. Why should not they go willingly when their Father calls them? Let us remember our bodies are allied to corruption, the worm and the dust; and let us seek for that lively hope which shall be fulfilled, when the hope of the wicked shall be put out in darkness; that when our bodies are in the grave, our souls may enjoy the rest reserved for the people of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They shall go down - That is, my hopes shall go down. All the expectations that I have cherished of life and happiness, will descend there with me. We have a similar expression when we say, that a man "has buried his hopes in the grave," when he loses an only son.<p>To the bars of the pit - "Bars of Sheol" - &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1500; &#1489;&#1491;  bad she'o&#770;l. Vulgate, "Profoundest deep." Septuagint, &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#837;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;  eis hade&#772;n - to Hades. Sheol, or Hades, was supposed to be under the earth. Its entrance was by the grave as a gate that led to it. It was protected by bars - as prisons are - so that those who entered there could not escape; see the notes at <a href="/isaiah/14-9.htm">Isaiah 14:9</a>. It was a dark, gloomy dwelling, far away from light, and from the comforts which people enjoy in this life; see <a href="//biblehub.com/job/10-21.htm">Job 10:21-22</a>. To that dark world Job expected soon to descend; and though he did not regard that as properly a place of punishment, yet it was not a place of positive joy. It was a gloomy and wretched world - the land of darkness and of the shadow of death; and he looked to the certainty of going there not with joy, but with anguish and distress of heart. Had Job been favored with the clear and elevated views of heaven which we have in the Christian revelation, death to him would have lost its gloom.<p>We wonder, often, that so good a man expressed such a dread of death, and that he did not look more calmly into the future world. But to do him justice, we should place ourselves in his situation. We should lay aside all that is cheerful and glad in the views of heaven which Christianity has given us. We should look upon the future world as the shadow of death; a land of gloom and spectres; a place beneath the ground - dark, chilly, repulsive; and we shall cease to wonder at the expressions of even so good a man at the prospect of death. When we look at him, we should remember with thankfulness the different views which we have of the future world, and the source to which we owe them. To us, if we are pious in any measure as Job was, death is the avenue, not to a world of gloom, but to a world of light and glory. It opens into heaven. There is no gloom, no darkness, no sorrow. There all are happy; and there all that is mysterious in this life is made plain - all that is sad is succeeded by eternal joy. These views we owe to that gospel which has brought life and immortality to light; and when we think of death and the future world, when from the midst of woes and sorrows we are compelled to look out on eternity, let us rejoice that we are not constrained to look forward with the sad forebodings of the Sage of Uz, but that we may think of the grave cheered by the strong consolations of Christian hope of the glorious resurrection.<p>When our rest together is in the dust - The rest of me and my hopes.

There is great difficulty in determining the subject to the verb "go down," which is the third person plural <span class="accented">feminine</span>, whereas the only plural substantive at all near - the word translated "bars" - is masculine. Some suppose Job's <span class="accented">hopes</span> to be meant, "hope" in the preceding verse having the force of any number of "hopes" (so the R.V.) Others disregard the grammatical difficulty of the plural <span class="accented">feminine</span> verb, and, making "bars" the nominative, translate, "The bars of Sheol shall go down," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "be broken down, perish;" or interrogatively, "Shall the bars of Sheol go down?" This rendering is thought to be "in harmony with the whole undercurrent of thought in the chapter;" but it has not approved itself to many commentators. The present commentator must acknowledge that he is unable to attach any satisfactory meaning to the words of the Hebrew text. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/17.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>10  But only come again all of you!<p>I shall not find a wise man among you. - <p>11  My days are past, My purposes cut off,<p>The cherished thoughts of my heart, - <p>12  Ye explain night as day,<p>Light is near when darkness sets in.<p>The truly righteous man, even if in the midst of his affliction he should see destruction before him, does not however forsake God.

He means that they deceive themselves concerning the actual state of the case before them; for in reality he is meeting death without being deceived, or allowing himself to be deceived, about the matter. His appeal is similar to <a href="/job/6-29.htm">Job 6:29</a>. Carey translates correctly: Attack me again with another round of arguments, etc. Instead of &#1493;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1501;, as it is written everywhere else (generally when the speech is drawing to a close), we find &#1493;&#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1501; (as the form of writing &#1488;&#1500;&#1501;, &#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1501; occurs also in the subst. &#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1501;), perh. in order to harmonize with &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1501;, which is here according to rule instead of &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1499;&#1501;, which corresponds more to our form of a vocative clause, just as in <a href="/1_kings/22-28.htm">1 Kings 22:28</a>; <a href="/micah/1-2.htm">Micah 1:2</a> (Ewald, 327, a).<p>(Note: Comp. my Anekdota zur Gesch. der mittelalterlichen Scholastik unter Juden und Moslemen (1841), S. 380.)<p>In &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468; the jussive and imper.

(comp. Ew. 229); moreover, the first verb gives the adverbial notion iterum, denuo to the second, according to Ges. 142, 3, a.<p>What follows, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/17-11.htm">Job 17:11</a>, is the confirmation of the fact that there is no wise man among them who might be able to give him efficient solace by a right estimate of the magnitude and undeservedness of his suffering. His life is indeed run out; and the most cherished plans and hopes which he had hedged in and fostered for the future in his heart, he has utterly and long since given up. The plur. (occurring only here) of &#1494;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;, which occurs also sensu malo, signifies projects, as &#1502;&#1494;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, <a href="/job/21-27.htm">Job 21:27</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/42-2.htm">Job 42:2</a>, from &#1494;&#1502;&#1501;, to tie; Aben-Ezra refers to the Arab. zama&#770;m (a thread, band, esp. a rein). These plans which are now become useless, these cherished thoughts, he calls &#1502;&#1493;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;, peculia (from &#1497;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;, to take possession of) of his heart. Thus, after Obad. Oba 1:17, Gecatilia (in Aben-Ezra) also explains, while, according to Ewald, Beitrge, S. 98, he understands the heart-strings, i.e., the trunks of the arteries (for thus is Arab. n't to be explained), and consequently, as Ewald himself, and even Farisol, most improbably combines &#1502;&#1493;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; with &#1502;&#1493;&#1514;&#1512; (&#1497;&#1514;&#1512;). Similarly the lxx &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b1; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;, as though the joints (instead of the valves) of the heart were intended; probably with Middeldorpf, after the Syriac Hexapla, &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1; is to be read instead of &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;; this, however, rests upon a mistaking of &#1502;&#1493;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; for &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;. While he is now almost dead, and his life-plans of the future are torn away (&#1504;&#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;), the friends turn night into day (&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1501;, as <a href="/isaiah/5-20.htm">Isaiah 5:20</a>); light is (i.e., according to their opinion) nearer than the face of darkness, i.e., than the darkness which is in reality turned to him, and which is as though it stared at him from the immediate future. Thus Nolde explains it as comparative, but connecting <a href="/job/17-12.htm">Job 17:12</a> with &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1502;&#1493;, and considering &#1508;&#1504;&#1497; (which is impossible by this compar. rendering) as meaningless: lucem magis propinquam quam tenebras. It is however possible that &#1502;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497; is used the same as in <a href="/job/23-17.htm">Job 23:17</a> : light is, as they think near before darkness, i.e., while darkness sets in (ingruentibus tenebris), according to which we have translated. If we understand <a href="/job/23-12.htm">Job 23:12</a> from Job's standpoint, and not from that of the friends, &#1502;&#1503; &#1511;&#1512;&#1493;&#1489; is to be explained according to the Arab. qr&#305;&#770;b mn, prope abest ab, as the lxx even translates&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;, which Olympiodorus interprets by &#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#787; &#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;. But by this rendering &#1508;&#1504;&#1497; makes the expression, which really needs investigation, only still lamer. Renderings, however, like Renan's Ah! votre lumire resemble aux tenbres, are removed from all criticism. The subjective rendering, by which <a href="/job/17-12.htm">Job 17:12</a> is under the government of &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1502;&#1493;, is after all the most natural. That he has darkness before him, while the friends present to him the approach of light on condition of penitence, is the thought that is developed in the next strophe. </body></html>
