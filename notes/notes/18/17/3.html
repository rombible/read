This is virtually the same prayer that we find Hezekiah using (<a href="/isaiah/38-14.htm" title="Like a crane or a swallow, so did I chatter: I did mourn as a dove: my eyes fail with looking upward: O LORD, I am oppressed; undertake for me.">Isaiah 38:14</a>): “O Lord, I am oppressed: <span class= "ital">undertake </span>for me,” that is, “Be surety for me.” (See also <a href="/psalms/119-122.htm" title="Be surety for your servant for good: let not the proud oppress me.">Psalm 119:122</a> : “Be surety for thy servant for good.”) There is that in man which demands exact and rigorous fulfilment or expiation of non-fulfilment. Job felt that his only hope of this fulfilment or expiation of non-fulfilment lay with God Himself: that same God who had put this sense of obligation within him; therefore he says, Be surety for me with Thyself.” He longed for the daysman who should lay his hand upon both him and God; he now longs for that surety with God that God alone can give. The surety must be Divine if his witness is in the heavens; it must be the witness of God to God himself. In this wonderful way does the language of Job fit in with all that we have since and elsewhere learnt of the persons in the Godhead.<p><span class= "bld">Who is he that will strike hands with me?</span>—This was the method of becoming surety; but he knows that there is no one among his friends who will do this, or that could do it if he would.

But, probably, we ought rather to consider Job as addressing God in these words, and then we must understand them as containing an humble desire that he would be his surety, or would appoint him a surety, who should maintain his righteous cause against his opposers. “Our English annotations,” says Henry, “give this reading of the verse; <span class="ital">Appoint, I pray thee, my surety with thee, </span>namely, Christ, who is with thee in heaven, and hath undertaken to be my surety: let him plead my cause, and stand up for me, and <span class="ital">who is he then that will strike upon my hand? </span>that is, who dares then contend with me?

Our time is ending. It concerns us carefully to redeem the days of time, and to spend them in getting ready for eternity. We see the good use the righteous should make of Job's afflictions from God, from enemies, and from friends. Instead of being discouraged in the service of God, by the hard usage this faithful servant of God met with, they should be made bold to proceed and persevere therein. Those who keep their eye upon heaven as their end, will keep their feet in the paths of religion as their way, whatever difficulties and discouragements they may meet with.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Lay down now - This is evidently an address to God - a repetition of the wish which he had so often expressed, that he might be permitted to bring his cause directly before him; see <a href="/job/13-3.htm">Job 13:3</a>. The whole passage here is obscure, because we are in a great measure ignorant of the ancient practices in courts of law, and of the ancient forms of trial. The general sense seems to be, that Job desires the Deity to enter into a judicial investigation, and to give him a "pledge" - or, as we should say, a "bond," or "security" - that he would not avail himself of his almighty power, but would place him on an equality in the trial, and allow him to plead his cause on equal terms; see the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/job/13-20.htm">Job 13:20-22</a>. The phrase "lay down now" means, lay down a pledge, or something of that kind; and may have referred to some ancient custom of giving security on going to trial, that no advantage would be taken, or that the parties would abide by the decision in the case.<p>Put me in a surety with thee - The word used here (&#1506;&#1512;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497;  &#8219;a&#770;rab&#305;&#770;yn) is from &#1506;&#1512;&#1489;  &#8219;a&#770;rab, to mix, mingle; to exchange, to barter and then to become surety for anyone - that is, to "exchange" places with him, or to stand in his place; <a href="/genesis/43-9.htm">Genesis 43:9</a>; <a href="/genesis/44-32.htm">Genesis 44:32</a>. Here the idea seems to be, that Job wished the Deity to give him some pledge or security that justice would be done, or that he would not take advantage of his power and majesty to overawe him. Or, as has been remarked, it may refer to some custom of furnishing security on a voluntary trial or arbitration, that the award of the referees would be observed. I think it most probable that this is the idea. The controversy here was to be voluntary. In a voluntary trial, or an arbitration, there is a necessity of some security by the parties that the decision shall be submitted to - a pledge to each other that they will abide by it. Such a pledge Job desired in this case. All this is language taken from courts, and should not be pressed too much, nor should Job be hastily charged with irreverence. Having once suggested the idea of a "trial" of the cause, it was natural for him to use the language which was commonly employed in reference to such trials; and these expressions are to be regarded as thrown in for the sake of "keeping," or verisimilitude.<p>Who is he that will strike hands with me? - Striking hands then, as now, seems to have been one mode of confirming an agreement, or ratifying a compact. The idea here is," Who is there that will be surety to me for thee?" that is, for the faithful observance of right and justice. There is an appearance of irreverence in this language, but it arises from carrying out the ideas pertaining to a form of trial in a court. In entering into "sureties," it was usual to unite hands; see <a href="/proverbs/6-1.htm">Proverbs 6:1</a> :<p>My son, if thou be surety for thy friend,<p>If thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger.<p>So <a href="/proverbs/17-18.htm">Proverbs 17:18</a> :<p>A man void of understanding striketh hands,<p>And becometh surety in the presence of his friend<p>Compare <a href="/proverbs/11-15.htm">Proverbs 11:15</a>; <a href="/proverbs/22-26.htm">Proverbs 22:26</a>. The same custom prevailed in the times of Homer and of Virgil. Thus, Homer (Iliad, &#x3b2; b. 341) says:<p>&#x3a0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#768; - <p> - &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b7;&#787;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; - <p>Pou de4 - <p> - dexiai he&#772;s epepithmen - <p>And so Virgil (Aeneid 4:597) says;<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/17.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3.

These words contain either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. A humble desire to God that he would appoint him a surety, who should undertake for his friends; that they should refer the cause in difference between them to God or to some other person, who should determine the matter in God’s name, and according to God’s will; or that God would be his Surety, or appoint him a surety who should maintain his righteous cause against his opposers; for so this phrase is oft used, as <span class="bld"><a href="/psalms/119-121.htm" title="I have done judgment and justice: leave me not to my oppressors.">Psalm 119:121</a>,122 Isa 38:14</span>.

Or rather, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. An appeal from God unto God, or a kind of challenge or desire of debating his cause with God; which, though it savoureth of too much boldness and irreverence to God, yet seeing Job expresseth the same desire almost in the same manner, <span class="bld"><a href="/job/9-33.htm" title="Neither is there any judge between us, that might lay his hand on us both.">Job 9:33</a>,34</span>, and is sharply reproved by God for contending with him, <span class="bld"><a href="/job/40-2.htm" title="Shall he that contends with the Almighty instruct him? he that reproves God, let him answer it.">Job 40:2</a></span>, I know no inconvenience of ascribing the same thing to him here. So the sense is, Because I am not able to deal with thee immediately, considering the dread of thy majesty, my only desire is, that thou wouldst deal with me upon fair and equal terms, as if thou wert a man like myself, and appoint some man who shall in thy name and stead determine the time and place for the trial of my cause with thee.

The first expression, give a pledge, is more fully expressed by the second, be surety for me with thee; and the question, Who (else) will <span class="ital">strike hands</span> with me? refers to the gesture or action by which suretyship was undertaken, viz. by striking hands.; cf. <a href="/proverbs/6-1.htm" title="My son, if you be surety for your friend, if you have stricken your hand with a stranger,">Proverbs 6:1</a>; <a href="/proverbs/11-15.htm" title="He that is surety for a stranger shall smart for it: and he that hates indebtedness is sure.">Proverbs 11:15</a> (margin), <a href="/proverbs/17-18.htm" title="A man void of understanding strikes hands, and becomes surety in the presence of his friend.">Proverbs 17:18</a>, <a href="/proverbs/22-26.htm" title="Be not you one of them that strike hands, or of them that are sureties for debts.">Proverbs 22:26</a>. First, Job beseeches God to become surety for him; that is something to be done in the present. But second, a suretyship necessarily refers to the future; though undertaken in the present it is to be fulfilled later. This is expressed by the words <span class="ital">with thee</span>, i. e. with God. Job beseeches God to undertake now that He will cause his innocence to be yet acknowledged with God. The same division of God into two parties, God who persecutes Job and wrongs him and God who becomes surety for Job and undertakes to see his cause righted with God, appears here as before in <a href="/job/16-21.htm" title="O that one might plead for a man with God, as a man pleads for his neighbor!">Job 16:21</a>; see something similar <a href="/hebrews/7-22.htm" title="By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.">Hebrews 7:22</a>.

The terms used in this verse are law terms. Job calls upon God to go into court with him, and, first of all, to deposit the caution-money which the court will require before it undertakes the investigation of the case. Next, he goes on to say, <span class="cmt_word">put me in a surety with thee</span>; or rather (as in the Revised Version), <span class="accented">be surety for me with thyself</span> which is either the same thing with giving a pledge, or a further legal requirement. Finally, he asks the question, <span class="cmt_word">Who is he that will strike hands with me?</span> meaning, "Who else is there but thyself, to whom I can look to be my surety, and by striking hands (comp. <a href="/proverbs/6-1.htm">Proverbs 6:1</a>) with me to accept the legal responsibility?" As Dr. Stanley Leathes says, "It is wonderful the way in which the language of Job fits in with what we have since and elsewhere learnt concerning the Persons in the Godhead." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/16.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>18  Oh earth, cover thou not my blood,<p>And let my cry find no resting-place!! - <p>19  Even now behold in heaven is my Witness,<p>And One who acknowledgeth me is in the heights!<p>20  Though the mockers of me are my friends - <p>To Eloah mine eyes pour forth tears,<p>21  That He may decide for man against Eloah,<p>And for the son of man against his friend.<p>22  For the years that may be numbered are coming on,<p>And I shall go a way without return.<p>Blood that is not covered up cries for vengeance, <a href="/ezekiel/24-7.htm">Ezekiel 24:7</a>.; so also blood still unavenged is laid bare that it may find vengeance, <a href="/isaiah/26-21.htm">Isaiah 26:21</a>. According to this idea, in the lofty consciousness of his innocence, Job calls upon the earth not to suck in his blood as of one innocently slain, but to let it lie bare, thereby showing that it must be first of all avenged ere the earth can take it up; <p>(Note: As, according to the tradition, it is said to have been impossible to remove the stain of the blood of Zachariah the son of Jehoiada, who was murdered in the court of the temple, until it was removed by the destruction of the temple itself.)<p>and for his cry, i.e., the cry (&#1494;&#1506;&#1511;&#1514;&#1497; to be explained according to <a href="/genesis/4-10.htm">Genesis 4:10</a>) proceeding from his blood as from his poured-out soul, he desires that it may urge its way unhindered and unstilled towards heaven without finding a place of rest (Symm. &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;). Therefore, in the very God who appears to him to be a blood-thirsty enemy in pursuit of him, Job nevertheless hopes to find a witness of his innocence: He will acknowledge his blood, like that of Abel, to be the blood of an innocent man. It is an inward irresistible demand made by his faith which here brings together two opposite principles - principles which the understanding cannot unite - with bewildering boldness. Job believes that God will even finally avenge the blood which His wrath has shed, as blood that has been innocently shed. This faith, which sends forth beyond death itself the word of absolute command contained in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/16-18.htm">Job 16:18</a>, in <a href="/job/16-19.htm">Job 16:19</a> brightens and becomes a certain confidence, which draws from the future into the present that acknowledgment which God afterwards makes of him as innocent. The thought of what is unmerited in that decree of wrath which delivers him over to death, is here forced into the background, and in the front stands only the thought of the exaltation of the God in heaven above human short-sightedness, and the thought that no one else but He is the final refuge of the oppressed: even now (i.e., this side of death)<p>(Note: Comp. <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/14-14.htm">1 Kings 14:14</a>, where it is probably to be explained: Jehovah shall raise up for himself a king over Israel who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam that day, but what? even now (&#1490;&#1501; &#1506;&#1514;&#1492;), i.e., He hath raised him up ( equals  but no, even now).)<p>continued...</body></html>
