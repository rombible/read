Our time is ending. It concerns us carefully to redeem the days of time, and to spend them in getting ready for eternity. We see the good use the righteous should make of Job's afflictions from God, from enemies, and from friends. Instead of being discouraged in the service of God, by the hard usage this faithful servant of God met with, they should be made bold to proceed and persevere therein. Those who keep their eye upon heaven as their end, will keep their feet in the paths of religion as their way, whatever difficulties and discouragements they may meet with.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The righteous also shall hold on his way - The meaning of this verse is plain; but the connection is not so apparent. It seems to me that it refers to "Job himself," and is a declaration that "he," a righteous man, who had been so grievously calumniated, would hold on his way, and become stronger and stronger, while "they" would sink in the public esteem, and be compelled to abandon their position. It is the expression of a confident assurance that "he" would be more and more confirmed in his integrity, and would become stronger and stronger in God. Though Job intended, probably, that this should be applied to himself, yet he has expressed it in a general manner, and indeed the whole passage has a proverbial cast; and it shows that even then it was the settled belief that the righteous would persevere. As an expression of the early faith of the pious in one of the now settled doctrines of Christianity, "the perseverance of the saints," this doctrine is invaluable. It shows that that doctrine has traveled down from the earliest ages. It was one of the elementary doctrines of religion in the earliest times. It became a proverb; and was admitted among the undisputed maxims of the wise and good, and it was such a sentiment as was just adapted to the circumstances of Job - a much tried and persecuted man. He was in all the danger of apostasy to which the pious are usually exposed; he was tempted to forsake his confidence in God; he was afflicted for reasons which he could not comprehend; he was without an earthly friend to sustain him, and he seemed to be forsaken by God himself; yet he had the fullest conviction that he would be enabled to persevere. The great principle was settled, that if there was true religion in the heart, it would abide; that if the path of righteousness had been entered, he who trod it would keep on his way.<p>And he that hath clean hands - The innocent; the friend of God; the man of pure life; see the notes at <a href="/job/9-30.htm">Job 9:30</a>; compare <a href="/psalms/24-4.htm">Psalm 24:4</a>. "Clean hands" here, are designed to denote a pure and holy life. Among the ancients they were regarded as indicative of purity of heart. Porphyry remarks (de antro Nympharum) that in the "mysteries," those who were initiated were accustomed to wash their hands with honey instead of water, as a pledge that they would preserve themselves from every impure and unholy thing; see Burder, in Rosenmuller's Alte u. neue Morgenland, in loc.<p>Shall be stronger and stronger - Margin, as in Hebrew add strength. He shall advance in the strength of his attachment to God. This is true. The man of pure and blameless life shall become more and more established in virtue; more confirmed in his principles; more convinced of the value and the truth of religion. Piety, like everything else, becomes stronger by exercise. The man who speaks truth only, becomes more and more attached to truth; the principle of benevolence is strengthened by being practiced; honesty, the more it is exhibited, becomes more the settled rule of the life; and he who prays, delights more and more in his appoaches to God. The tendency of religion in the heart is to grow stronger and stronger; and God intends that he who has once loved him, shall continue to love him forever. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/17.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. The strength of religious principle is heightened by misfortune. The pious shall take fresh courage to persevere from the example of suffering Job. The image is from a warrior acquiring new courage in action (Isa 40:30, 31; Php 1:14).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/job/17.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Shall hold on his way, </span> i.e. shall persist in that good way into which he hath entered, and not be turned from it by any afflictions which may befall himself or any other good men, nor by any contempt or reproach cast upon them by the ungodly by reason thereof. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">He that hath clean hands, </span> i.e. whose life and the course of his actions is holy and righteous; which is a sign that his heart also is pure and perfect. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Shall be stronger and stronger; </span> shall not be shaken and discouraged by the grievous afflictions of the godly, nor by the bitter censures and reproaches of hypocrites or wicked men, cast upon them for that cause; but will be continued thereby, and made more constant and resolute in cleaving to God, and his ways and people, in spite of all difficulties and miseries. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/job/17.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>The righteous also shall hold on his way,.... He that is righteous, not in appearance but really, not in a legal but in an evangelic sense; who is justified by the righteousness of Job's living Redeemer, who lives by faith on his righteousness, and in consequence of that in holiness of life and conversation; such an one being in Christ the way of righteousness and salvation, and walking in the paths of faith, holiness, and truth, and in all the tracks of religious worship, private and public, he will persevere therein, and will not on any account depart out of the right way into which he has been led and directed. This is opposed to a going back, as some do, and to a turning to the right hand or the left, as others, and to a standing still, being stumbled, offended, and discouraged; and it supposes a progress, a going forward in the way, so as not to be moved out of it by their own, or the afflictions of others, by the reproaches and persecutions of men, the temptations of Satan, the snares, riches, honours, and pleasures of the world, or through darkness, desertion, and unbelief; they may indeed have many slips and falls, and be almost, but not altogether, out of the way, and never finally or to perdition; which is owing not to their conduct and care, might and strength, but to the power of God, and the supplies of his grace, to Christ and his strength, and to the Spirit and his influence, guidance, and direction: <p>and he that hath clean hands shall be stronger and stronger; or "add strength" (u); increase in it. This character is opposed to one of an immoral life and conversation, and describes one that is not guilty of any notorious crime, that does not live in any known sin, but in the general course of his life is upright and sincere, holy, harmless, and inoffensive; such a man as he is already a partaker of spiritual grace and strength, and so, as he wants more, it is given him; his spiritual strength is renewed, he goes from one degree of it to another, and even while walking in the way of God he finds an increase of it; yea, that itself is strength unto him; as his day is his strength is, to assist him in religious services, to enable him to resist his enemies, and endure afflictions, and continue in the good ways of God. <p>(u)  "addet fortitudinem", Pagninus, Montanus. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/17.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The righteous also shall hold on his <span class="cverse3">{k}</span> way, and he that hath clean hands shall be stronger and stronger.</span><p>(k) That is, will not be discouraged, considering that the godly are punished as well as the wicked.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/job/17.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">9</span>. <span class="ital">The righteous also shall hold on</span>] Or, <span class="bld">But the righteous shall hold on</span>. The righteous will not allow themselves to be misled from the path of rectitude by these moral wrongs which they see prevail in God’s rule of the world, they will cling in spite of them to their righteous life. Nay such obscurities and wrongs will but make the joy which they possess in righteousness the dearer and deeper, and instead of faltering they will be (rather, <span class="bld">will wax</span>) stronger and stronger. Though Job speaks here in the name of the “righteous” and “clean of hands” it is his own sentiments and resolution that he gives expression to, and the passage is perhaps the most surprising and lofty in the Book. In ch. <a href="/job/19-25.htm" title="For I know that my redeemer lives, and that he shall stand at the latter day on the earth:">Job 19:25</a> Job, conscious of his innocence and assured by his heart that he is a God-fearing man, is enabled to reach out his hand to grasp what must yet in the future be the solution of the riddle of his present life. And, no doubt, a similar thought precedes the present passage (ch. <a href="/job/16-18.htm" title="O earth, cover not you my blood, and let my cry have no place.">Job 16:18</a> <span class="ital">seq</span>.). It does not appear, however, that this thought is present to his mind here. Rather he is again completely enveloped in the darkness of his present life, the awful problem of which confounds him and all religious men. But no mysteries or wrongs shall make him falter in the way of righteousness. And the human spirit rises to the height of moral grandeur, when it proclaims its resolution to hold on the way of righteousness independently both of men and God.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The righteous also</span>; rather, <span class="accented">yet the righteous.</span> A strong opposing clause.

Treated by the friends as a criminal justly undergoing punishment, he seeks his refuge in God, who has set the mark of a horrible disease upon him contrary to his desert, as though he were guilty, and implores Him to confirm the reality of his innocence in some way or other by laying down a pledge for him (&#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;). The further prayer is &#1506;&#1512;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497;, as word of entreaty which occurs also in Hezekiah's psalm, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/38-14.htm">Isaiah 38:14</a>, and <a href="/psalms/119-122.htm">Psalm 119:122</a>; &#1506;&#1512;&#1489; seq. acc. signifies, as noted on the latter passage, to furnish surety for any one, and gen. to take the place of a mediator (comp. also on <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/7-22.htm">Hebrews 7:22</a>, where &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; is a synon. of &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;). Here, however, the significant &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1498; is added: furnish security for me with Thyself; elsewhere the form is &#1500; &#1506;&#1512;&#1489;, to furnish security for (<a href="/proverbs/6-1.htm">Proverbs 6:1</a>), or &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497; before, any one, here with &#1506;&#1501; of the person by whom the security is to be accepted. The thought already expressed in <a href="/job/16-21.htm">Job 16:21</a> receives a still stronger expression here: God is conceived of as two persons, on the one side as a judge who treats Job as one deserving of punishment, on the other side as a bondsman who pledges himself for the innocence of the sufferer before the judge, and stands as it were as surety against the future. In the question, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/17-3.htm">Job 17:3</a>, the representation is again somewhat changed: Job appears here as the one to whom surety is given. &#1504;&#1514;&#1511;&#1506;, described by expositors as reciprocal, is rather reflexive: to give one's hand (the only instance of the med. form of &#1499;&#1468;&#1507; &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1506;)  equals  to give surety by striking hands, dextera data sponsionem in se recipere (Hlgst.). And &#1500;&#1497;&#1491;&#1497; is not to be explained after the analogy of the passive, as the usual &#1500; of the agents: who would allow himself to be struck by my hand, i.e., who would accept the surety from me (Wolfson), which is unnatural both in representation and expression; but it is, according to <a href="/proverbs/6-1.htm">Proverbs 6:1</a> (vid., Bertheau), intended of the hand of him who receives the stroke of the hand of him who gives the pledge. This is therefore the meaning of the question: who else (&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; &#1502;&#1497;), if not God himself, should strike (his hand) to my hand, i.e., should furnish to me a pledge (viz., of my innocence) by joining hands? There is none but God alone who can intercede for him, as a guarantee of his innocence before himself and others. This negative answer: None but Thou alone, is established in <a href="/job/17-4.htm">Job 17:4</a>. God has closed the heart of the friends against understanding, prop. concealed, i.e., He has fixed a curtain, a wall of partition, between their hearts and the right understanding of the matter; He has smitten them with blindness, therefore He will not (since they are suffering from a want of perception which He has ordained, and which is consequently known to Him) allow them to be exalted, i.e., to conquer and triumph. "The exaltation of the friends," observes Hirzel rightly, "would be, that God should openly justify their assertion of Job's guilt." Lwenthal translates: therefore art thou not honoured; but it is not pointed &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1502;&#1501;  equals  &#1514;&#1468;&#1514;&#1512;&#1502;&#1501;, but &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1502;&#1501;, whether it be that &#1488;&#1514;&#1501; is to be supplied, or that it is equivalent to &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1502;&#1502;&#1501; (Ew. 62, a, who, however, prefers to take is as n. Hithpa. like &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1502;&#1501; in the unimproved signification: improvement, since he maintains this affords no right idea), according to the analogy of similar verb-forms (<a href="/job/31-15.htm">Job 31:15</a>; <a href="/isaiah/64-6.htm">Isaiah 64:6</a>), by a resolving of the two similar consonants which occur together.<p>The hope thus expressed Job establishes (<a href="/job/17-5.htm">Job 17:5</a>) by a principle from general experience, that he who offers his friends as spoil for distribution will be punished most severely for the same upon his children: he shall not escape the divine retribution which visits him, upon his own children, for the wrong done to his friends. Almost all modern expositors are agreed in this rendering of &#1500;&#1495;&#1500;&#1511; as regards <a href="/job/17-5.htm">Job 17:5</a>; but &#1495;&#1500;&#1511; must not be translated "lot" (Ewald), which it never means; it signifies a share of spoil, as e.g., <a href="/numbers/31-36.htm">Numbers 31:36</a> (Jerome praedam), or even with a verbal force: plundering (from &#1495;&#1500;&#1511;,   <a href="/2_chronicles/28-21.htm">2 Chronicles 28:21</a>), or even in antithesis to entering into bond for a friend with all that one possesses (Stick., Schlottm.), a dividing (of one's property)  equals  distraining, as a result of the surrender to the creditor, to which the verb &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491; is appropriate, which would then denote denouncing before a court of justice, as <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-10.htm">Jeremiah 20:10</a>, not merely proclaiming openly, as <a href="/isaiah/3-9.htm">Isaiah 3:9</a>. We have translated "spoil," which admits of all these modifications and excludes none; the general meaning is certainly: one deserts (instead of shielding as an intercessor) his friends and delivers them up; &#1497;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491; with a general subj., as <a href="/job/4-2.htm">Job 4:2</a> (if any one attempts), <a href="/job/15-3.htm">Job 15:3</a>; <a href="/job/27-23.htm">Job 27:23</a>. With respect to the other half of the verse, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/17-5.htm">Job 17:5</a>, the optative rendering: may they languish (Vaih.), to the adoption of which the old expositors have been misled by parallels like <a href="/psalms/109-9.htm">Psalm 109:9</a>., is to be rejected; it is contrary to the character of Job (<a href="/job/31-30.htm">Job 31:30</a>). We agree with Mercerus: Nequaquam hoc per imprecationem, sed ut consequentis justissimae poenae denunciationem ab Iobo dictum putamus. For v. 5b is also not to be taken as a circumstantial clause: even if the eyes of his children languish (Ew., Hlgst. Stick., Hahn, Schl.). It is not &#1512;&#1506;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;, but &#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501;; and before supposing here a Synallage num. so liable to be misunderstood, one must try to get over the difficulty without it, which is here easy enough. Hence Job is made, in the intended application of the general principle, to allude to his own children, and Ewald really considers him the father of infant children, which, however, as may be seen from the prologue, is nothing but an invention unsupported by the history. Since it is &#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493; and not &#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;, we refer the suff. to the subj. of &#1497;&#1490;&#1497;&#1491;. The Waw of &#1493;&#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497; Mich. calls Waw consecutivum; it, however, rather combines things that are inseparable (certainly as cause and effect, sin and punishment). And it is &#1497;&#1490;&#1497;&#1491;, not &#1492;&#1490;&#1497;&#1491;, because the perf. would describe the fact as past, while the fut. places us in the midst of this faithless conduct. Job says God cannot possibly allow these, his three friends, the upper hand. One proclaims his friends as spoil (comp. <a href="/job/6-27.htm">Job 6:27</a>), and the eyes of his children languish (comp. <a href="/job/11-20.htm">Job 11:20</a>), i.e., he who so faithlessly disowns the claims of affection, is punished for it on that which he holds most dear. But this uncharitableness which he experiences is also a visitation of God. In the next strophe he refers all that he meets with from man to Him as the final cause, but not without a presage of the purpose for which it is designed. </body></html>
