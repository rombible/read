His gloom, unbelief, and hard thoughts of God, were as much to be ascribed to Satan's inward temptations, and his anguish of soul, under the sense of God's displeasure, as to his outward trials, and remaining depravity. Our Creator, become in Christ our Redeemer also, will not destroy the work of his hands in any humble believer; but will renew him unto holiness, that he may enjoy eternal life. If anguish on earth renders the grave a desirable refuge, what will be their condition who are condemned to the blackness of darkness for ever?

He did not know how to act. He could not understand the reason of the divine dealings, and he was wholly unable to explain them, and hence, he did not know how to act in a proper manner. It is expressive of a state of mind where the individual wishes to think and feel right, but where he finds so much to perplex him, that he does not know what to do. Job was sure that his friends were not right in the position which they maintained - that he was a sinner of enormous character, and that his sufferings were proof of this, and yet he did not know how to answer their arguments. He desired to have confidence in God, and yet he knew not how to reconcile his dealings with his sense of right. He felt that he was a friend of God, and he did not know why he should visit one who had this consciousness in this distressing and painful manner. His mind was perplexed, vacillating, embarrassed, and he did not know what to do or say. The truth in this whole argument was, that he was more often right than his friends, but that he, in common with them, had embraced some principles which he was compelled to admit to be true, or which he could not demonstrate to be false, which gave them greatly the advantage in the argument, and which they pressed upon him now with overwhelming force.<p>Then thou markest me - Dost carefully observe every fault. Why he did this, Job could not see. The same difficulty he expressed in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/7-17.htm">Job 7:17-19</a>; see the notes at that place.<p>And wilt not acquit me - Wilt not pardon me. Job did not understand why God would not do this. It was exceedingly perplexing to him that God held him to be guilty, and would not pardon him if he had sinned. The same perplexity he expressed in <a href="/job/7-21.htm">Job 7:21</a>; see the note at that verse. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14, 15. Job is perplexed because God "marks" every sin of his with such ceaseless rigor.

There are two poetical passages which treat explicitly of this mysterious existence: this strophe of the book of Job, and the Psalm by David, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/139-13.htm">Psalm 139:13-16</a> (Psychol. S. 210). The assertion of Scheuchzer, Hoffmann, and Oetinger, that these passages of Scripture "include, and indeed go beyond, all recent systemata generationis," attributes to Scripture a design of imparting instruction, - a purpose which is foreign to it. Scripture nowhere attempts an analysis of the workings of nature, but only traces them back to their final cause. According to the view of Scripture, a creative act similar to the creation of Adam is repeated at the origin of each individual; and the continuation of development according to natural laws is not less the working of God than the creative planting of the very beginning. Thy hands, says Job, have formed (&#1506;&#1510;&#1468;&#1489;, to cut, carve, fashion; cognate are &#1495;&#1510;&#1489;, &#1511;&#1510;&#1489;, without the accompanying notion of toil, which makes this word specially appropriate, as describing the fashioning of the complicated nature of man) and perfected me. We do not translate: made; for &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; stands in the same relation to &#1489;&#1512;&#1488; and &#1497;&#1510;&#1512; as perficere to creare and fingere (<a href="/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/43-7.htm">Isaiah 43:7</a>). &#1497;&#1495;&#1491; refers to the members of the body collectively, and &#1505;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489; to the whole form. The perfecting as clay implies three things: the earthiness of the substance, the origin of man without his knowledge and co-operation, and the moulding of the shapeless substance by divine power and wisdom. The primal origin of man, de limo terrae (<a href="/job/33-6.htm">Job 33:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/139-15.htm">Psalm 139:15</a>), is repeated in the womb. The figures which follow (<a href="/job/10-10.htm">Job 10:10</a>) describe this origin, which being obscure is all the more mysterious, and glorifies the power of God the more. The sperma is likened to milk; the &#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1498; (used elsewhere of smelting), which Seb. Schmid rightly explains rem colliquatam fundere et immittere in formam aliquam, refers to the nisus formativus which dwells in it. The embryo which is formed from the sperma is likened to &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492;, which means in all the Semitic dialects cheese (curd). "As whey" (Ewald, Hahn) is not suitable; whey does not curdle; in making cheese it is allowed to run off from the curdled milk. "As cream" (Schlottm.) is not less incorrect; cream is not lac coagulatum, which the word signifies. The embryo forming itself from the sperma is like milk which is curdled and beaten into shape.<p>The consecutio temporum, moreover, must be observed here. It is, for example, incorrect to translate, with Ewald: Dost Thou not let me flow away like milk, etc. Job looks back to the beginning of his life; the four clauses, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/10-10.htm">Job 10:10</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/10-11.htm">Job 10:11</a>, under the control of the first two verbs (<a href="/job/10-8.htm">Job 10:8</a>), which influence the whole strophe, are also retrospective in meaning. The futt. are consequently like synchronous imperff.; as, then, <a href="/job/10-12.htm">Job 10:12</a> returns to perff., <a href="/job/10-11.htm">Job 10:11</a> describes the development of the embryo to the full-grown infant, on which Grotius remarks: Hic ordo est in genitura: primum pellicula fit, deinde in ea caro, duriora paulatim accedunt, and by <a href="//biblehub.com/job/10-12.htm">Job 10:12</a>, the manifestations of divine goodness, not only in the womb, but from the beginning of life and onwards, are intended. The expression "Life and favour (this combination does not occur elsewhere) hast Thou done to me" is zeugmatic: He has given him life, and sustained that life amidst constant proofs of favour; His care has guarded the spirit (&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;), by which his frame becomes a living and self-conscious being. This grateful retrospect is interspersed with painful reflections, in which Job gives utterance to his feeling of the contrast between the manifestation of the divine goodness which he had hitherto experienced and his present condition. As in <a href="/job/10-8.htm">Job 10:8</a>., &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500;&#1468;&#1506;&#1504;&#1497;, which Hirzel wrongly translates: and wilt now destroy me; it is rather: and hast now swallowed me up, i.e., drawn me down into destruction, as it were brought me to nought; or even, if in the fut. consec., as is frequently the case, the consecutive and not the aorist signification preponderates: and now swallowest me up; and in <a href="/job/10-9.htm">Job 10:9</a> (where, though not clear from the syntax, it is clear from the substance that &#1514;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497; is not to be understood as an imperfect, like the futt. in <a href="/job/10-10.htm">Job 10:10</a>.): wilt Thou cause me to become dust again? The same tone is continued in the following strophe. Thus graciously has he been brought into being, and his life sustained, in order that he may come to such a terrible end. </body></html>
