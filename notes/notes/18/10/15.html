His gloom, unbelief, and hard thoughts of God, were as much to be ascribed to Satan's inward temptations, and his anguish of soul, under the sense of God's displeasure, as to his outward trials, and remaining depravity. Our Creator, become in Christ our Redeemer also, will not destroy the work of his hands in any humble believer; but will renew him unto holiness, that he may enjoy eternal life. If anguish on earth renders the grave a desirable refuge, what will be their condition who are condemned to the blackness of darkness for ever? Let every sinner seek deliverance from that dreadful state, and every believer be thankful to Jesus, who delivereth from the wrath to come.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>If I be wicked, woe unto me - The meaning of this in this connection is, "I am full of perplexity and sorrow. Whether I am wicked or righteous, I find no comfort. Whatever is my character, my efforts to be happy are unavailing, and my mind is full of anguish. Woe follows if I have been guilty of sin; and if I am not a sinful man, I am equally incapable of enjoyment. In every way I am doomed to wretchedness." And if I be righteous, yet will I not lift up my head. That is, with confidence and cheerfulness. The meaning is, that though he was conscious that he was not a hypocrite, yet he did not know what to do. God treated him as if he were wicked, and his friends regarded him as such, and he was overwhelmed with the perplexities of his situation. He could not lift up his head with confidence, though he was certain that he was not a sinner in the sense in which they charged him with being such; and yet since he was treated by God in a manner so similar to the mode in which the wicked are treated, he felt ashamed and confounded. Who has not felt the same thing? Who has not experienced a sense of shame and mortification at being sick, - a proof of guilt, and an expression of the hatred of God against sin? Who has not felt humbled that he must die, as the most vile of the race must die, and that his body must become the "prey of corruption" and "the banquet of worms," as a demonstration of guilt? Such humiliation Job experienced. He was treated as if he were the vilest of sinners. He endured from God sufferings such as they endure. He was so regarded by his friends. He felt humbled and mortified that he was brought into this situation, and was ashamed that he could not meet the arguments of his friends.<p>I am full of confusion - Shame, ignominy, distress, and perplexity. On every side there was embarrassment, and he knew not what to do. His friends regarded him as vile, and he could not but admit that he was so treated by God.<p>Therefore see thou mine affliction - The word rendered here "see" (&#1512;&#1488;&#1492;  ra&#770;'a&#770;h) in the imperative, Rosenmuller, Gesenius, and others suppose should be regarded as in the infinitive absolute, the finite verb being understood; "seeing I see my affliction," that is, I certainly see it. So the Chaldee and the Syriac render it, and this agrees better with the connection of the passage. "I see the depth of my affliction. I cannot hide it from myself. I see, and must admit, that God treats me as if I were a sinner, and I am greatly perplexed and embarrassed by that fact. My mind is in confusion, and I know not what to say." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15. lift up my head&#8212;in conscious innocence (Ps 3:3).<p>see thou&#8212;rather, "and seeing I see (I too well see) mine affliction," (which seems to prove me guilty) [Umbreit].<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/job/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">If I be wicked, </span> i.e. an ungodly hypocrite, as my friends esteem me, then I am truly and extremely, and must be eternally, miserable. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Righteous, </span> i.e. an upright and good man: so, whether good or bad, all comes to one; I have no relief. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Yet will I not lift up my head; </span> or, yet <span class="ital">can I not</span>, &c; the future tense being used potentially; yet I have no comfort, nor confidence, or hopes of any good. <span class="ital">Lifting up the head</span> or <span class="ital">face</span> is oft mentioned as a sign of comfort and confidence, as <span class="bld"><a href="/psalms/3-3.htm" title="But you, O LORD, are a shield for me; my glory, and the lifter up of my head.">Psalm 3:3</a> <a href="/luke/21-28.htm" title="And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draws near.">Luke 21:28</a></span>; as, on the contrary, grief and shame are described by its dejection or casting down. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Confusion, </span> or <span class="ital">reproach</span>, from my friends, and from others, <span class="bld"><a href="/job/30-1.htm" title="But now they that are younger than I have me in derision, whose fathers I would have disdained to have set with the dogs of my flock.">Job 30:1</a></span>, &c., and from God too, who casts me off, and makes me contemptible.

If, on the contrary, it be admitted that I have not sinned so grievously as to be pronounced unrighteous, even then I will not beast; I will not exalt myself; I will not hold up my head as if I were sinless. I am full of confusion. This clause should not be separated from the last. The sense runs on: "I will not lift up my head (being, as I am), full of confusion," or "of shame," through consciousness of my own imperfections (see the Revised Version). <span class="cmt_word">Therefore see thou mine affliction</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and seeing my afflictions.</span> The sense given in the Authorized Version is maintained by Rosenmuller, De Wette, Stanley Leathes, and Merx, and defended by Canon Cook; but opposed by Schultens, Professor Lee, and our Revisers. If we accept the views of these last, the whole passage will run thus: "If I be [pronounced] wicked, woe unto reel but if righteous, yet will I not lift up my head, being [as I am] full of confusion, and seeing my afflictions." Job still views his afflictions as signs of God's disfavour, and therefore proofs of his sinfulness. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>  8  Thy hands have formed and perfected me<p>Altogether round about, and Thou hast now swallowed me up!<p>  9  Consider now, that Thou has perfected me as clay,<p>And wilt Thou turn me again into dust?<p>10  Hast Thou not poured me out as milk,<p>And curdled me as curd?<p>11  With skin and flesh hast Thou clothed me,<p>And Thou hast intertwined me with bones and sinews;<p>12  Life and favour Thou hast shown me,<p>And thy care hath guarded my breath.<p>The development of the embryo was regarded by the Israelitish Chokma as one of the greatest mysteries (<a href="/ecclesiastes/11-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 11:5</a>; 2 Macc. 7:22f.). There are two poetical passages which treat explicitly of this mysterious existence: this strophe of the book of Job, and the Psalm by David, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/139-13.htm">Psalm 139:13-16</a> (Psychol. S. 210). The assertion of Scheuchzer, Hoffmann, and Oetinger, that these passages of Scripture "include, and indeed go beyond, all recent systemata generationis," attributes to Scripture a design of imparting instruction, - a purpose which is foreign to it. Scripture nowhere attempts an analysis of the workings of nature, but only traces them back to their final cause. According to the view of Scripture, a creative act similar to the creation of Adam is repeated at the origin of each individual; and the continuation of development according to natural laws is not less the working of God than the creative planting of the very beginning. Thy hands, says Job, have formed (&#1506;&#1510;&#1468;&#1489;, to cut, carve, fashion; cognate are &#1495;&#1510;&#1489;, &#1511;&#1510;&#1489;, without the accompanying notion of toil, which makes this word specially appropriate, as describing the fashioning of the complicated nature of man) and perfected me. We do not translate: made; for &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; stands in the same relation to &#1489;&#1512;&#1488; and &#1497;&#1510;&#1512; as perficere to creare and fingere (<a href="/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/43-7.htm">Isaiah 43:7</a>). &#1497;&#1495;&#1491; refers to the members of the body collectively, and &#1505;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489; to the whole form. The perfecting as clay implies three things: the earthiness of the substance, the origin of man without his knowledge and co-operation, and the moulding of the shapeless substance by divine power and wisdom. The primal origin of man, de limo terrae (<a href="/job/33-6.htm">Job 33:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/139-15.htm">Psalm 139:15</a>), is repeated in the womb. The figures which follow (<a href="/job/10-10.htm">Job 10:10</a>) describe this origin, which being obscure is all the more mysterious, and glorifies the power of God the more. The sperma is likened to milk; the &#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1498; (used elsewhere of smelting), which Seb. Schmid rightly explains rem colliquatam fundere et immittere in formam aliquam, refers to the nisus formativus which dwells in it. The embryo which is formed from the sperma is likened to &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492;, which means in all the Semitic dialects cheese (curd). "As whey" (Ewald, Hahn) is not suitable; whey does not curdle; in making cheese it is allowed to run off from the curdled milk. "As cream" (Schlottm.) is not less incorrect; cream is not lac coagulatum, which the word signifies. The embryo forming itself from the sperma is like milk which is curdled and beaten into shape.<p>The consecutio temporum, moreover, must be observed here. It is, for example, incorrect to translate, with Ewald: Dost Thou not let me flow away like milk, etc. Job looks back to the beginning of his life; the four clauses, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/10-10.htm">Job 10:10</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/10-11.htm">Job 10:11</a>, under the control of the first two verbs (<a href="/job/10-8.htm">Job 10:8</a>), which influence the whole strophe, are also retrospective in meaning. The futt. are consequently like synchronous imperff.; as, then, <a href="/job/10-12.htm">Job 10:12</a> returns to perff., <a href="/job/10-11.htm">Job 10:11</a> describes the development of the embryo to the full-grown infant, on which Grotius remarks: Hic ordo est in genitura: primum pellicula fit, deinde in ea caro, duriora paulatim accedunt, and by <a href="//biblehub.com/job/10-12.htm">Job 10:12</a>, the manifestations of divine goodness, not only in the womb, but from the beginning of life and onwards, are intended. The expression "Life and favour (this combination does not occur elsewhere) hast Thou done to me" is zeugmatic: He has given him life, and sustained that life amidst constant proofs of favour; His care has guarded the spirit (&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;), by which his frame becomes a living and self-conscious being. This grateful retrospect is interspersed with painful reflections, in which Job gives utterance to his feeling of the contrast between the manifestation of the divine goodness which he had hitherto experienced and his present condition. As in <a href="/job/10-8.htm">Job 10:8</a>., &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500;&#1468;&#1506;&#1504;&#1497;, which Hirzel wrongly translates: and wilt now destroy me; it is rather: and hast now swallowed me up, i.e., drawn me down into destruction, as it were brought me to nought; or even, if in the fut. consec., as is frequently the case, the consecutive and not the aorist signification preponderates: and now swallowest me up; and in <a href="/job/10-9.htm">Job 10:9</a> (where, though not clear from the syntax, it is clear from the substance that &#1514;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497; is not to be understood as an imperfect, like the futt. in <a href="/job/10-10.htm">Job 10:10</a>.): wilt Thou cause me to become dust again? The same tone is continued in the following strophe. Thus graciously has he been brought into being, and his life sustained, in order that he may come to such a terrible end. </body></html>
