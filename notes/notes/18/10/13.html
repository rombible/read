God made us, not we ourselves. How sad that those bodies should be instruments of unrighteousness, which are capable of being temples of the Holy Ghost! But the soul is the life, the soul is the man, and this is the gift of God.

Most expositors suppose that the latter is intended. Such is the opinion of Rosenmuller, Good, Noyes, and Scott. According to this the idea is, that God had purposed in his heart to bring these calamities upon him. They were a part of his counsel and design. To hide in the heart, or to lay up in the heart, is a phrase expressive of a secret purpose. I see no reason to confine it, however, to the calamities which Job had experienced. It may refer to all the plans and doings of the Most High, to which Job had just referred. All his acts in the creation and preservation of man, were a part of his secret counsel, He had formed the plan in his heart, and was now executing it in the various dispensations of his providence.<p>I know that this is with thee - That all this is a part of thy purpose. It has its origin in thee, and is according to thy counsel. This is the language of piety, recognizing the great truth that all things are in accordance with the purposes of God, or that his plans embrace all events - a doctrine which Job most assuredly held. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. is with thee&#8212;was Thy purpose.

Of Job’s present afflictions. So the sense is this, Yet in the midst of all those manifestations of thy grace and kindness to me, thou didst retain a secret purpose of changing thy course and carriage towards me, and of bringing these dreadful calamities upon me. Or rather, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2.

So the argument is this, Let the remembrance of thy former great favours vouchsafed to me move thee to give me further blessings, and a speedy deliverance. For this is usual both with God and men, to choose and delight to do more good to those to whom they have done much good already; which is the ground of that known passage, <span class="bld"><a href="/matthew/13-12.htm" title="For whoever has, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whoever has not, from him shall be taken away even that he has.">Matthew 13:12</a></span>. <span class="ital">To him that hath shall be given</span>. <span class="ital">With thee</span>, i.e. in thy mind and heart; thou hast not forgot it: so the same thing is here repeated in other words. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/job/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And these things thou hast hid in thine heart,....

The contradiction between this dealing with Job in the womb and since his birth and God’s present treatment of him is only to be reconciled by the supposition that God’s present severe treatment of Job had been resolved on from the first, and that His careful fashioning of him and care over him had been in order the better to carry out His purpose. The details of this cruel purpose are given in the following verses.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And these things hast thou hid in thine heart</span>; rather, <span class="accented">get these things didst thou hide in thine heart</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "Yet all the while, notwithstanding thy protecting care and gracious favour, thou wert hiding in thy heart the intention to bring all these evils upon me; thou couldst not but have known what thou wert about to do, though thou didst conceal thy intention, and allow no sign of it to escape thee." <span class="cmt_word">I know that this is with thee</span>; rather, <span class="accented">I know that this was with thee</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> this intention to destroy my happiness was "with thee" - present to thy thought - even while thou wert loading me with favour. Job's statement cannot be gainsaid; but it involves no real charge against God, who assigns men prosperity or suffering as is best for them at the time. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>  3  Doth it please Thee when Thou oppressest,<p>That Thou rejectest the work of Thy hands,<p>While Thou shinest upon the counsel of the wicked?<p>  4  Hast Thou eyes of flesh,<p>Or seest Thou as a mortal seeth?<p>  5  Are Thy days as the days of a mortal,<p>Or Thy years as man's days,<p>  6  That Thou seekest after my iniquity,<p>And searchest after my sin?<p>  7  Although Thou knowest that I am not a wicked man,<p>And there is none that can deliver out of Thy hand.<p>There are three questions by which Job seeks to exhaust every possible way of accounting for his sufferings as coming from God. These attempts at explanation, however, are at once destroyed, because they proceed upon conceptions which are unworthy of God, and opposed to His nature. Firstly, Whether it gives Him pleasure (&#1496;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489;, agreeable, as <a href="/job/13-9.htm">Job 13:9</a>) when He oppresses, when He despises, i.e., keeps down forcibly or casts from Him as hateful (&#1502;&#1488;&#1505;, as <a href="/psalms/89-39.htm">Psalm 89:39</a>; <a href="/isaiah/54-6.htm">Isaiah 54:6</a>) the work of His hand; while, on the contrary, He permits light to shine from above upon the design of the wicked, i.e., favours it? Man is called the &#1497;&#1490;&#1497;&#1506; of the divine hands, as though he were elaborated by them, because at his origin (<a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>), the continuation of which is the development in the womb (<a href="/psalms/139-15.htm">Psalm 139:15</a>), he came into existence in a remarkable manner by the directly personal, careful, and, so to speak, skilful working of God. That it is the morally innocent which is here described, may be seen not only from the contrast (<a href="/job/10-3.htm">Job 10:3</a>), but also from the fact that he only can be spoken of as oppressed and rejected. Moreover, "the work of Thy hands" involves a negative reply to the question. Such an unloving mood of self-satisfaction is contrary to the bounty and beneficence of that love to which man owes his existence. Secondly, Whether God has eyes of flesh, i.e., of sense, which regard only the outward appearance, without an insight into the inner nature, or whether He sees as mortals see, i.e., judges, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1; (<a href="/john/8-15.htm">John 8:15</a>)? Mercier correctly: num ex facie judicas, ut affectibus ducaris more hominum. This question also supplies its own negative; it is based upon the thought that God lookest on the heart (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>). Thirdly, Whether His life is like to the brevity of man's life, so that He is not able to wait until a man's sin manifests itself, but must institute such a painful course of investigation with him, in order to extort from him as quickly as possible a confession of it? Suffering appears here to be a means of inquisition, which is followed by the final judgment when the guilt is proved. What is added in <a href="/job/10-7.htm">Job 10:7</a> puts this supposition aside also as inconceivable. Such a mode of proceeding may be conceived of in a mortal ruler, who, on account of his short-sightedness, seeks to bring about by severe measures that which was at first only conjecture, and who, from the apprehension that he may not witness that vengeance in which he delights, hastens forward the criminal process as much as possible, in order that his victim may not escape him. God, however, to whom belongs absolute knowledge and absolute power, would act thus, although, etc. &#1506;&#1500;, although, notwithstanding (proceeding from the signification, besides, insuper), as <a href="/job/17-16.htm">Job 17:16</a> (<a href="/isaiah/53-9.htm">Isaiah 53:9</a>), <a href="/job/34-6.htm">Job 34:6</a>. God knows even from the first that he (Job) will not appear as a guilty person (&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;, as in <a href="/job/9-29.htm">Job 9:29</a>); and however that may be, He is at all events sure of him, for nothing escapes the hand of God.<p>That operation of the divine love which is first echoed in "the labour of Thy hands," is taken up in the following strophe, and, as Job contemplates it, his present lot seems to him quite incomprehensible. </body></html>
