His gloom, unbelief, and hard thoughts of God, were as much to be ascribed to Satan's inward temptations, and his anguish of soul, under the sense of God's displeasure, as to his outward trials, and remaining depravity. Our Creator, become in Christ our Redeemer also, will not destroy the work of his hands in any humble believer; but will renew him unto holiness, that he may enjoy eternal life. If anguish on earth renders the grave a desirable refuge, what will be their condition who are condemned to the blackness of darkness for ever? Let every sinner seek deliverance from that dreadful state, and every believer be thankful to Jesus, who delivereth from the wrath to come.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Before I go - from where "I shall not return." To the grave, to the land of shades, to<p>"That undiscovered country, from whose bourne<p>No traveler returns."<p>To the land of darkness - This passage is important as furnishing an illustration of what was early understood about the regions of the dead. The essential idea here is that it was a land of darkness, of total and absolute night. This idea Job presents in a great variety of forms and phrases. He amplifies it, and uses apparently all the epithets which he can command to represent the utter and entire darkness of the place. The place referred to is not the grave, but the region beyond, the abode of departed spirits, the Hades of the ancients; and the idea here is, that it is a place where not a clear ray of light ever shines. That this was a common opinion of the ancients in regard to the world of departed spirits, is well known. Virgil thus speaks of those gloomy regions:<p>Oii, quibusimperium est animarum, umbraeque silentes,<p>Et Chaos, et Phlegethon, loca nocte tacentia late,<p>Sit mihi fas audita loqui; slt numine vestro<p>Pandere res alta terra et caligine mersas.<p>Ibant obscuri sola sub nocte per umbram,<p>Perque domos Ditis vacuas, et inania regna:<p>Quale per incertam lunam sub luce maligna<p>Est iter in silvis: ubi coelum condidit umbra<p>Jupiter, et rebus nox abstulit atra colorem<p>Aeneid vi. 259ff<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20.

Before he went out of the world, the way of all flesh, to the grave, his long home, from whence there is no return to this world, and to the business and affairs of it; to a man's house, his family and his friends, to converse with them as before, there will be no return until the resurrection, which Job does not here deny, as some have thought; it was a doctrine he well understood, and strongly asserts in <a href="/job/19-26.htm">Job 19:26</a>; but this must be understood in the same sense as in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/7-9.htm">Job 7:9</a>, <p>even to the land of darkness, and the shadow of death; which describes not the state of the damned, as some Popish interpreters, carry it; for Job had no thought nor fear of such a state; but the grave, which is called "a land", or country, it being large and spacious, and full of inhabitants; a land of "darkness", a very dark one, where the body separated from the soul is deprived of all light; where the sun, moon, and stars, are never seen; nor is there the least crevice that light can enter in at, or be seen by those that dwell in those shades, which are "the shadow of death" itself; deadly shades, thick and gross ones, the darkest shades, where death itself is, or dead men are, destitute of light and life; where no pleasure, comfort, and conversation, can be had; and therefore a land in itself most undesirable. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/10.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Before I go <i>whence</i> I shall not <span class="cverse3">{t}</span> return, <i>even</i> to the land of darkness and the shadow of death;</span><p>(t) He speaks this in the person of a sinner, that is overcome with passions and with the feeling of God's judgments and therefore cannot apprehend in that state the mercies of God, and the comfort of the resurrection.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Before I go whence I shall not return</span> (comp. <a href="/job/7-9.htm">Job 7:9</a>; and see <a href="/2_samuel/12-23.htm">2 Samuel 12:23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Even to the land of darkness and the shadow of death</span>. Job's idea of the receptacle of the dead, while it has some analogies with the Egyptian under-world, and even more with the Greek and Roman conceptions of Hades or Orcus, was probably derived from Babylonia, or Chaldea, on which the land that he inhabited bordered (<a href="/job/1-17.htm">Job 1:17</a>). It was within the earth, consequently dark and sunless (compare the <span class="accented">Umbrae</span> of the Romans, and Euripides's <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>), deep (<a href="/job/11-8.htm">Job 11:8</a>), dreary, fastened with belts and bars (<a href="/job/17-16.htm">Job 17:16</a>). The Babylonians spoke of it as "the abode of darkness and famine, where earth was men's food, and their  nourishment clay; where light was not seen, but in darkness they dwelt; where ghosts, like birds, fluttered their wings; and where, on the doors and on the door-posts, the dust lay undisturbed" (Transactions of the Society of Biblical Archaeology, vol. 1. p. 118). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>13  And such Thou hast hidden in Thy heart,<p>I perceive that this was in Thy mind:<p>14  If I should sin, Thou wouldst take note of it,<p>And not acquit me of my iniquity.<p>15  If I should act wickedly, woe unto me!<p>And were I righteous, I should not lift up my head,<p>Being full of shame and conscious of my misery.<p>16  And were I to raise it, Thou wouldst hunt me as a lion,<p>And ever display on me Thy wondrous power,<p>17  Thou wouldst ever bring fresh witnesses against me,<p>And increase Thy wrath against me,<p>I should be compelled to withstand continuously advancing troops and a host.<p>This manifestation of divine goodness which Job has experienced from the earliest existence seems to him, as he compares his present lot of suffering with it, to have served as a veil to a hidden purpose of a totally opposite character. That purpose - to make this life, which has been so graciously called into existence and guarded thus far, the object of the severest and most condemning visitation - is now manifest. Both &#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; and &#1494;&#1488;&#1514; refer to what is to follow: &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1498; &#1494;&#1488;&#1514; used of the thought conceived, the purpose cherished, as <a href="/job/23-14.htm">Job 23:14</a>; <a href="/job/27-11.htm">Job 27:11</a>. All that follows receives a future colouring from this principal clause, "This is what Thou hadst designed to do," which rules the strophe. Thus <a href="/job/10-14.htm">Job 10:14</a> is to be rendered: If I had sinned, Thou wouldst have kept me in remembrance, properly custodies me, which is here equivalent to custoditurus eras me. &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;, with the acc. of the person, according to <a href="/psalms/130-3.htm">Psalm 130:3</a> (where it is followed by the acc. of the sin), is to be understood: to keep any one in remembrance, i.e., to mark him as sinful (Hirzel). This appears more appropriate than rigide observaturus eras me (Schlottm.). &#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;&#1504;&#1497;, according to Ges. 121, 4, might be taken for &#1500;&#1497; &#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514; (viz., &#1495;&#1496;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514;&#1497;); but this is unnecessary, and we have merely translated it thus for the sake of clearness. His infirmities must not be passed by unpunished; and if he should act wickedly (&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;, of malignant sin, in distinction from &#1495;&#1496;&#1488;), woe unto him (comp. &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;, <a href="/1_corinthians/9-16.htm">1 Corinthians 9:16</a>). According to the construction referred to above, &#1493;&#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1514;&#1497; is praet. hypotheticum (Ges. 155, 4, a); and the conclusion follows without waw apodosis: If I had acted rightly, I should not have raised my head, being full of shame and conscious of my misery. The adjectives are not in apposition to &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; (Bttcher), but describe the condition into which he would be brought, instead of being able (according to the ethical principle, <a href="/genesis/4-7.htm">Genesis 4:7</a>) to raise his head cheerfully. &#1512;&#1488;&#1492; constr. of &#1512;&#1488;&#1492;, as &#1513;&#1474;&#1489;&#1506; or &#1513;&#1474;&#1489;&#1506;. It is needless, with Pisc., Hirz., Bttch., and Ewald, to alter it to &#1512;&#1488;&#1492;, since &#1512;&#1488;&#1492; is verbal adjective like &#1497;&#1508;&#1492;, &#1504;&#1499;&#1492;, &#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;. Moreover, &#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; cannot be imperative (Rosenm., De Wette); for although imperatives, joined by waw to sentences of a different construction, do occur (<a href="/psalms/77-2.htm">Psalm 77:2</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/21-3.htm">2 Samuel 21:3</a>), such an exclamation would destroy the connection and tone of the strophe in the present case.</body></html>
