Thus, though Job constantly maintains against his friends, that many ungodly men do prosper, and escape punishment, in this life, yet, withal, he asserts that God will certainly, sooner or later, punish them; and that he sometimes doth it here, cutting them off by cruel and untimely deaths, or otherwise inflicting some notable judgment upon them, of which he also speaks <a href="/job/21-17.htm" title="How oft is the candle of the wicked put out! and how oft comes their destruction on them!

They are taken off with other men, as the harvestman gathers the ears of corn as they come to hand. There will often appear much to resemble the wrong view of Providence Job takes in this chapter. But we are taught by the word of inspiration, that these notions are formed in ignorance, from partial views. The providence of God, in the affairs of men, is in every thing a just and wise providence. Let us apply this whenever the Lord may try us. He cannot do wrong. The unequalled sorrows of the Son of God when on earth, unless looked at in this view, perplex the mind. But when we behold him, as the sinner's Surety, bearing the curse, we can explain why he should endure that wrath which was due to sin, that Divine justice might be satisfied, and his people saved.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He is swift as the waters - Noyes renders this, "They are as swift as the skiff upon the waters." Dr. Good, "Miserable is this man upon the waters." Wemyss, "Such should be as foam upon the waters." Le Clerc says that there is scarcely any passage of the Scriptures more obscure than this, and the variety of rendering adopted will show at once the perplexity of expositors. Rosenmuller supposes that the particle of comparison (&#1499; k) is to be understood, and that the meaning is, "he is as a light thing upon the waters;" and this probably expresses the true sense. It is a comparison of the thief with a light boat, or any other light thing that moves gently on the face of the water, and that glides along without noise. So gently and noiselessly does the thief glide along in the dark. He is rapid in his motion, but he is still. It is not uncommon to describe one who is about to commit crime in the night as moving noiselessly along, and as taking every precaution that the utmost silence should be preserved. So Macbeth, when about to commit murder, soliloquizes:<p>Now o'er the one half world<p>Nature seems dead - <p>And withered murder,<p>Alarm'd by his sentinel, the wolf,<p>Who's howl'd his watch, thus with his stealthy pace,<p>With Tarquin's ravishing strides, towards his design<p>Moves like a ghost.<p>Thou sure and firm-set earth,<p>Hear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear<p>The very stones prate of my whereabout.<p>I do not know, however, that this comparison of a thief, with a light object on the waters, is to be found any where else, but it is one of great beauty. The word rendered "swift" (&#1511;&#1500;  qal) may denote either that which is swift, or that which is light. In <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/30-16.htm">Isaiah 30:16</a>, it is applied to a fleet horse. Here it may be rendered, "He is as a light thing upon the face of the waters."<p>Their portion is cursed in the earth - That is, their manner of life, their way of obtaining a livelihood, is deserving of execration. The result of humble toil and honest labor may be said to be blessed; but not the property which they acquire. Rosenmuller and Noyes, however, suppose that the word "portion" here refers to their habitation, and that the idea is, they have their dwelling in wild and uncultivated places; they live in places that are cursed by sterility and barrenness. The Hebrew will bear either construction. The word lot, as it is commonly understood by us, may perhaps embrace both ideas. "Theirs is a cursed lot on earth."<p>He beholdeth not the way of the vineyards - That is, they do not spend their lives in cultivating them, nor do they derive a subsistence from them. They live by plunder, and their abodes are in wild retreats, far away from quiet and civilised society. The object seems to be to describe marauders, who make a sudden descent at night on the possessions of others, and who have their dwellings far away from fields that are covered with the fruits of cultivation. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/24.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18-21. In these verses Job quotes the opinions of his adversaries ironically; he quoted them so before (Job 21:7-21). In Job 24:22-24, he states his own observation as the opposite.

Or "upon the face of the waters" (y); which some interpret of another set and sort of wicked men, guilty of like crimes, not on land, but upon the mighty waters; pirates, such that commit robberies upon the high seas; who generally choose the swiftest vessels to run from place to place for their prey, and to carry off their booty when pursued; whose manner of life is detestable to other persons; and especially they are cursed by those on land, who suffer by robbing the ships of their goods they send abroad; but these men best like such a manner of life, and prefer it to any thing by land, to agriculture or cultivation of vineyards, which they have no regard unto, as is supposed to be intimated by the following clauses; but it is greatly to be questioned whether there were any such persons, or that such practices obtained so early as the time of Job. Schultens thinks Sodomites are meant, who are most profuse to lust, and flow in it like water, plough the accursed field, by going after strange flesh, and have no regard to lawful marriage, or honest wives, comparable to vines and vineyards; but I should rather think those guilty of the sin of Onan are meant, who have no regard to the propagation of posterity. Others, as Ben Gersom are of opinion that this refers to the above persons, murderers, adulterers, and thieves, <a href="/job/24-14.htm">Job 24:14</a>; who, being conscious of their crimes and due deserts, and in danger of being taken up, and brought to just punishment, flee to the sea with all the haste they can, take shipping, and go abroad into foreign parts; where they dwell in desolate and uncultivated places of the earth, which are cursed, or nigh unto cursing, and never more see pleasant fields, gardens, orchards, and vineyards: though others suppose that these words describe the temper and disposition of such wicked persons, who are unstable as water, carried about as any light thing upon the water with every wind of temptation, run swiftly into evil, and make haste to commit sin; though it seems best of all to interpret the words as respecting the state of wicked men at death, who then pass away swiftly and suddenly as gliding waters, and are "lighter" or swifter "than the waters", as Mr. Broughton renders the words: <p>their portion is cursed in the earth; that part and portion of the good things of this world they have is with a curse; their very blessings are cursed, and what they leave behind has a curse entailed on it, and in process of time is blasted, and comes to nothing; for, the curse of the Lord is in the house of the wicked, <a href="/proverbs/3-33.htm">Proverbs 3:33</a>; <p>he beholdeth not the way of the vineyards; as in their lifetime they had no regard to the way of good and righteous men, of whom Jarchi in a mystical sense, interprets the vineyards; so at death they are taken away from all their worldly enjoyments they set their hearts upon; their places know them no more, and they no more see their fields, and vineyards, and oliveyards, and take no more walks unto them nor in them. <p>(y)   "super faciem aquarum", Mercerus, Bolducius, Beza, Drusius, Schultens. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/24.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">He <i>is</i> swift as the <span class="cverse3">{r}</span> waters; their <span class="cverse3">{s}</span> portion is cursed in the earth: he beholdeth not the way of the vineyards.</span><p>(r) He flees to the waters for his succour.<p>(s) They think that all the world is bent against them and dare not go by the highway.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/job/24.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">18</span>. <span class="ital">He is swift as the waters</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">he is swift upon the face of</span> the waters.

Are they seized by the sudden judgments of God and delivered into the hand of their own transgression (ch. <a href="/job/8-4.htm" title="If your children have sinned against him, and he have cast them away for their transgression;">Job 8:4</a>)? or, are they prolonged in the possession of their power, protected in their wickedness, and brought to a natural and peaceful end at last like men in general? The following passage gives both answers, one in <span class="ital"><a href="/context/job/24-18.htm" title="He is swift as the waters; their portion is cursed in the earth: he beholds not the way of the vineyards....">Job 24:18-21</a></span>, and the other in <span class="ital"><a href="/context/job/24-22.htm" title="He draws also the mighty with his power: he rises up, and no man is sure of life....">Job 24:22-24</a></span>. The former answer is that of Job’s friends, and perhaps of the common mind, a passage or fragments from a poetical expression of whose creed Job seems to cite. This answer is only introduced ironically and in order to supply the background to the true picture which Job himself draws of the history of these violent and wicked men. And this picture is a very different one.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He is swift as the waters</span>. "Locus obscurissimus" (Schulteus). Scarcely any two commentators agree even as to the subject on which Job proceeds to speak. Some regard him as giving his own judgment on the ultimate fate of the wicked; others, as anticipating what his opponents will say on the point. One recent expositor takes the passage as referring to the efforts made by the malefactors of vers. 14-16 to escape from justice, and to the discredit and difficulty in which they involve themselves. Another suggests that Job here calls attention to a fresh class of oppressors, viz. water-thieves (see Strabo, 16:18), who, starting in light boats from some island in a lake or river, plundered the neighbouring lands, making the portions of the landholders worthless, and causing them to neglect the cultivation, even of their vineyards. If we accept this view, the proper translation of the present verse will be, <span class="accented">Swift is he</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the water-thief) <span class="accented">upon the face of the waters</span>: <span class="accented">then is the portion of them who dwell in the land worthless</span>; <span class="accented">no one turneth his face toward his vine. yards</span> (see Professor Lee's 'Book of Job,' pp. 153, 378, 379). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/24.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>It is natural, with Umbr., Ew., Hirz., and others, to read &#1502;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501; like the Peschito; but as m&#305;&#770;te in Syriac, so also &#1502;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501; in Hebrew as a noun everywhere signifies the dead (Arab. mauta), not the dying, mortals (Arab. matna); wherefore Ephrem interprets the praes. "they groan" by the perf. "they have groaned." The pointing &#1502;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501;, therefore, is quite correct; but the accentuation which, by giving Mehupach Zinnorith to &#1502;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512;, and Asla legarmeh to &#1502;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501;, places the two words in a genitival relation, is hardly correct: in the city of men, i.e., the inhabited, thickly-populated city, they groan; not: men (as Rosenm. explains, according to <a href="/genesis/9-6.htm">Genesis 9:6</a>; <a href="/proverbs/11-6.htm">Proverbs 11:6</a>) groan; for just because &#1502;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501; appeared to be too inexpressive as a subject, this accentuation seems to have been preferred. It is also possible that the signification fierce anger (<a href="/hosea/11-9.htm">Hosea 11:9</a>), or anguish (<a href="/jeremiah/15-8.htm">Jeremiah 15:8</a>), was combined with &#1506;&#1497;&#1512;, comp.

What we remarked above, p. 483, on the form &#1511;&#1497;&#1501;, is cleared up by the following observation of Wetzstein: "The form &#1511;&#1497;&#1501; belongs to the numerous class of segolate forms of the form &#1508;&#1506;&#1500;, which, as belonging to the earliest period of the formation of the Semitic languages, take neither plural nor feminine terminations; they have often a collective meaning, and are not originally abstracta, but concreta in the sense of the Arabic part. act. mufa&#770;&#8219;l. This inflexible primitive formation is frequently found in the present day in the idiom of the steppe, which shows that the Hebrew is essentially of primeval antiquity (uralt). Thus the Beduin says: hu&#770; qitl&#305;&#770; (&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; &#1511;&#1496;&#1500;&#1497;), he is my opponent in a hand-to-hand combat; nith&#305;&#770; (&#1504;&#1496;&#1495;&#1497;), my opponent in the tournament with lances; ch&#305;&#770;lf&#305;&#770; (&#1495;&#1500;&#1508;&#1497;) and didd&#305;&#770; (&#1510;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;), my adversary; thus a step-mother is called d&#305;&#770;r (&#1510;&#1497;&#1512;), as the oppressor of the step-children, and a concubine dirr (&#1510;&#1512;&#1512;), as the oppressor of her rival. The Kamus also furnishes several words which belong here, as tilb (&#1496;&#1500;&#1489;), a persecutor." Accordingly, &#1511;&#1497;&#1501; is derived from &#1511;&#1493;&#1501;, as also &#1506;&#1497;&#1512;, a city, from &#1506;&#1493;&#1512; (whence, according to a prevalent law of the change of letters, we have &#1506;&#1497;&#1512; first of all, plur. &#1506;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="/judges/10-4.htm">Judges 10:4</a>), and signifies the rebelling one, i.e., the enemy (who is now in the idiom of the steppe called qo&#770;ma&#770;ni, from qo&#770;m, a state of war, a feud), as &#1506;&#1497;&#1512;, a keeper and &#1510;&#1497;&#1512;, a messenger; &#1506;&#1497;&#1512; (&#1511;&#1497;&#1512;) is also originally concrete, a wall (enclosure).)<p>With Jer., Symm., and Theod., we take &#1502;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501; as the sighing ones themselves; the feebleness of the subject disappears if we explain the passage according to such passages as <a href="/deuteronomy/2-34.htm">Deuteronomy 2:34</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-6.htm">Deuteronomy 3:6</a>, comp. <a href="/judges/20-48.htm">Judges 20:48</a> : it is the male inhabitants that are intended, whom any conqueror would put to the sword; we have therefore translated men (men of war), although "people" (<a href="/job/11-3.htm">Job 11:3</a>) also would not have been unsuitable according to the ancient use of the word. &#1504;&#1488;&#1511; is intended of the groans of the dying, as <a href="/jeremiah/51-52.htm">Jeremiah 51:52</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-24.htm">Ezekiel 30:24</a>, as <a href="/job/24-12.htm">Job 24:12</a> also shows: the soul of those that are mortally wounded cries out. &#1495;&#1500;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; signifies not merely the slain and already dead, but, according to its etymon, those who are pierced through those who have received their death-blow; their soul cries out, since it does not leave the body without a struggle. Such things happen without God preventing them. &#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1501; &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1500;&#1492;, He observeth not the abomination, either  equals  &#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1501; &#1489;&#1500;&#1489;&#1493;, <a href="/job/22-22.htm">Job 22:22</a> (He layeth it not to heart), or, since the phrase occurs nowhere elliptically,  equals  &#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1501; &#1500;&#1489;&#1493; &#1506;&#1500;, <a href="/job/1-8.htm">Job 1:8</a>; <a href="/job/34-23.htm">Job 34:23</a>) He does not direct His heart, His attention to it), here as elliptical, as in <a href="/job/4-20.htm">Job 4:20</a>; <a href="/isaiah/41-20.htm">Isaiah 41:20</a>. True, the latter phrase is never joined with the acc. of the object; but if we translate after &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;, <a href="/job/4-18.htm">Job 4:18</a> : non imputat, He does not reckon such &#1514;&#1508;&#1500;&#1492;, i.e., does not punish it, &#1489;&#1468;&#1501; (&#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1501;) ought to be supplied, which is still somewhat liable to misconstruction, since the preceding subject is not the oppressors, but those who suffer oppression. &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1500;&#1492; is properly insipidity (comp. Arab. tafila, to stink), absurdity, self-contradiction, here the immorality which sets at nought the moral order of the world, and remains nevertheless unpunished. The Syriac version reads &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;, and translates, like Louis Bridel (1818): et Dieu ne fait aucune attention  leur prire. </body></html>
