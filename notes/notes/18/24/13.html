See what pains those take, who make provision for the flesh to fulfil the lusts of it: pains to compass, and then to hide that which will end in death and hell at last. Less pains would mortify and crucify the flesh, and be life and heaven at last. Shame came in with sin, and everlasting shame is at the end of it. See the misery of sinners; they are exposed to continual frights: yet see their folly; they are afraid of coming under the eye of men, but have no dread of God's eye, which is always upon them: they are not afraid of doing things which they are afraid of being known to do.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They are of those that rebel against the light - That is, they hate the light: compare <a href="/john/3-20.htm">John 3:20</a>. It is unpleasant to them, and they perform their deeds in the night. Job here commences a reference to another class of wicked persons - those who perform their deeds in the darkness of the night; and he shows that the same thing is true of them as of those who commit crimes in open day, that God does not interpose directly to punish them. They are suffered to live in prosperity. This should be rendered, "Others hate the light;" or, "There are those also who are rebellious against the light." There is great force in the declaration, that those who perform deeds of wickedness in the night are "rebels" against the light of day.<p>They know not the ways thereof - They do not see it.

The light of nature, acting contrary to the dictates of their own consciences, in being guilty of the inhumanity, barbarity, and cruelty they were chargeable with in the above instances; or the light of the law, as the Targum; though as yet the law of the ten commandments was not in being; or however was not known to these persons; or against God himself, who is light, and in him no darkness at all, is clothed with it, and is the Father of lights unto his creatures, the Light of lights, and the Light of the world, from whom all light, natural, spiritual, and eternal, springs, <a href="/1_john/1-5.htm">1 John 1:5</a>; which is the sense of most of the Jewish commentators (s); and every sin is a rebellion against God, and betrays the enmity of the carnal mind to him, is an act of hostility against him, and shows men to be enemies in their minds to him: <p>they know not the ways thereof; the ways of light, but prefer the ways of darkness to them; or the ways of God, the ways of his commandments, which he has prescribed for men, and directed them to walk in; these they know not, are wilfully ignorant of, desire not the knowledge of them, and will be at no pains to get any acquaintance with them; or they approve not of them, they are not pleasing to them, and they choose not to walk in them: <p>nor abide in the paths thereof; if at any time they are got into the paths of light, truth, and righteousness, or in the ways of God's commandments, and do a few good actions, they do not continue therein, but quickly go out of the way again, leave the paths of righteousness to walk in the ways of darkness, <a href="/proverbs/2-13.htm">Proverbs 2:13</a>. Some interpreters understand these words entirely of natural light, and of men who are like owls and bats that flee from the light, who are authors of the works of darkness, and do what they do in the dark secretly, and hate the light, and do not choose to come unto it, that their deeds may not be reproved; and so now Job enters upon the account of another set of men different from the former, who did what they did openly, in the face of the sun, and before all men; but these he is now about to describe are such who commit iniquity secretly and privately, and instances in the murderer adulterer, and thief, in <a href="/job/24-14.htm">Job 24:14</a>. <p>(s) Aben Ezra, Ben Gersom, Sephorno, Bar Tzemach. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/24.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">They are of those that rebel against the <span class="cverse3">{p}</span> light; they know not the ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof.</span><p>(p) That is, God's word, because they are reproved by it.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/job/24.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">13</span>. <span class="ital">They are of those</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">these are of them that rebel</span>.

By <a href="//biblehub.com/job/24-5.htm">Job 24:5</a>, one is reminded of <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/104-21.htm">Psalm 104:21-23</a>, especially since in <a href="/job/24-11.htm">Job 24:11</a> of this Psalm the &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501;, onagri (Kulans), are mentioned, - those beautiful animals<p>(Note: Layard, New Discoveries, p. 270, describes these wild asses' colts. The Arabic name is like the Hebrew, el-fera&#770;, or also hima&#770;r el-wahsh, i.e., wild ass, as we have translated, whose home is on the steppe. For fuller particulars, vid., Wetzstein's note on <a href="/job/39-5.htm">Job 39:5</a>.)<p>which, while young, as difficult to be broken in, and when grown up are difficult to be caught; which in their love of freedom are an image of the Beduin, <a href="/genesis/16-12.htm">Genesis 16:12</a>; their untractableness an image of that which cannot be bound, <a href="/job/11-12.htm">Job 11:12</a>; and from their roaming about in herds in waste regions, are here an image of a gregarious, vagrant, and freebooter kind of life. The old expositors, as also Rosenm., Umbr., Arnh., and Vaih., are mistaken in thinking that aliud hominum sceleratorum genus is described in <a href="/job/24-5.htm">Job 24:5</a>. Ewald and Hirz. were the first to perceive that <a href="/job/24-5.htm">Job 24:5</a> is the further development of <a href="//biblehub.com/job/24-4.htm">Job 24:4</a>, and that here, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/30-1.htm">Job 30:1</a>, those who are driven back into the wastes and caves, and a remnant of the ejected and oppressed aborigines who drag out a miserable existence, are described.<p>The accentuation rightly connects &#1508;&#1512;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; &#1489;&#1502;&#1491;&#1489;&#1512;; by the omission of the Caph similit., as e.g., <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/51-12.htm">Isaiah 51:12</a>, the comparison (like a wild ass) becomes an equalization (as a wild ass). The perf. &#1497;&#1510;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; is a general uncoloured expression of that which is usual: they go forth &#1489;&#1508;&#1506;&#1500;&#1501;, in their work (not: to their work, as the Psalmist, in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/104-23.htm">Psalm 104:23</a>, expresses himself, exchanging &#1489; for &#1500;). &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497; &#1500;&#1496;&#1468;&#1512;&#1507;,  searching after prey, i.e., to satisfy their hunger (<a href="/psalms/104-21.htm">Psalm 104:21</a>), from &#1496;&#1512;&#1507;, in the primary signification decerpere (vid., Hupfeld on <a href="/psalms/7-3.htm">Psalm 7:3</a>), describes that which in general forms their daily occupation as they roam about; the constructivus is used here, without any proper genitive relation, as a form of connection, according to Ges. 116, 1. The idea of waylaying is not to be connected with the expression. Job describes those who are perishing in want and misery, not so much as those who themselves are guilty of evil practices, as those who have been brought down to poverty by the wrongdoing of others. As is implied in &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497; (comp. the morning <a href="/psalms/63-2.htm">Psalm 63:2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/26-9.htm">Isaiah 26:9</a>), Job describes their going forth in the early morning; the children (&#1504;&#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, as <a href="/job/1-19.htm">Job 1:19</a>; <a href="/job/29-5.htm">Job 29:5</a>) are those who first feel the pangs of hunger. &#1500;&#1493; refers individually to the father in the company: the steppe (with its scant supply of roots and herbs) is to him food for the children; he snatches it from it, it must furnish it for him. The idea is not: for himself and his family (Hirz., Hahn, and others); for v. 6, which has been much misunderstood, describes how they, particularly the adults, obtain their necessary subsistence. There is no MS authority for reading &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1470;&#1500;&#1493; instead of &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493;; the translation "what is not to him" (lxx, Targ., and partially also the Syriac version) is therefore to be rejected. Raschi correctly interprets &#1497;&#1489;&#1493;&#1500;&#1493; as a general explanation, and Ralbag &#1514;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1493;: it is, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/6-5.htm">Job 6:5</a>, mixed fodder for cattle, farrago, consisting of oats or barley sown among vetches and beans, that is intended. The meaning is not, however, as most expositors explain it, that they seek to satisfy their hunger with food for cattle grown in the fields of the rich evil-doer; for &#1511;&#1510;&#1512; does not signify to sweep together, but to reap in an orderly manner; and if they meant to steal, why did they not seize the better portion of the produce? It is correct to take the suff. as referring to the &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; which is mentioned in the next clause, but it is not to be understood that they plunder his fields per nefas; on the contrary, that he hires them to cut the fodder for his cattle, but does not like to entrust the reaping of the better kinds of corn to them. It is impracticable to press the Hiph. &#1497;&#1511;&#1510;&#1497;&#1512;&#1493; of the Chethib to favour this rendering; on the contrary, &#1492;&#1511;&#1510;&#1497;&#1512; stands to &#1511;&#1510;&#1512; in like (not causative) signification as &#1492;&#1504;&#1495;&#1492; to &#1504;&#1495;&#1492; (vid., on <a href="/job/31-18.htm">Job 31:18</a>). In like manner, <a href="/job/24-6.htm">Job 24:6</a> is to be understood of hired labour. The rich man prudently hesitates to employ these poor people as vintagers; but he makes use of their labour (whilst his own men are fully employed at the wine-vats) to gather the straggling grapes which ripen late, and were therefore left at the vintage season. the older expositors are reminded of &#1500;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473;, late hay, and explain &#1497;&#1500;&#1511;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468; as denom. by &#1497;&#1499;&#1512;&#1514;&#1493; &#1500;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493; (Aben-Ezra, Immanuel, and others) or &#1497;&#1488;&#1499;&#1500;&#1493; &#1500;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493; (Parchon); but how unnatural to think of the second mowing, or even of eating the after-growth of grass, where the vineyard is the subject referred to! On the contrary, &#1500;&#1511;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; signifies, as it were, serotinare, i.e., serotinos fructus colligere (Rosenm.):<p>(Note: In the idiom of Hauran, &#1500;&#1511;&#1513;&#1474;, fut. i, signifies to be late, to come late; in Piel, to delay, e.g., the evening meal, return, etc.; in Hithpa. telaqqas, to arrive too late. Hence laq&#305;&#770;s &#1500;&#1511;&#1497;&#1513;&#1474; and loqs&#305;&#770; &#1500;&#1511;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;, delayed, of any matter, e.g., &#1500;&#1511;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; and &#1494;&#1512;&#1506; &#1500;&#1511;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;, late seed ( equals  &#1500;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473;, <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/7-1.htm">Amos 7:1</a>, in connection with which the late rain in April, which often fails, is reckoned on), &#1493;&#1500;&#1491; &#1500;&#1511;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;, a child born late (i.e., in old age); bak&#305;&#770;r &#1489;&#1499;&#1497;&#1512; and bekr&#305;&#770; &#1489;&#1499;&#1512;&#1497; are the opposites in every signification. - Wetzst.)<p>continued...</body></html>
