They are taken off with other men, as the harvestman gathers the ears of corn as they come to hand. There will often appear much to resemble the wrong view of Providence Job takes in this chapter. But we are taught by the word of inspiration, that these notions are formed in ignorance, from partial views. The providence of God, in the affairs of men, is in every thing a just and wise providence. Let us apply this whenever the Lord may try us. He cannot do wrong. The unequalled sorrows of the Son of God when on earth, unless looked at in this view, perplex the mind. But when we behold him, as the sinner's Surety, bearing the curse, we can explain why he should endure that wrath which was due to sin, that Divine justice might be satisfied, and his people saved.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He draweth also the mighty with his power - The word here rendered draweth (&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498;  ma&#770;shak), means to draw; and then, to lay hold of, to take, to take away, and, hence, to remove, to destroy; <a href="/psalms/28-3.htm">Psalm 28:3</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/22-20.htm">Ezekiel 22:20</a>. The idea here seems to be, that his acts of oppression and cruelty were not confined to the poor and the defenseless. Even the great and the mighty were also exposed, and he spared none. No one was safe, and no rights could be regarded as secure. The character here described is one that pertains to a tyrant, or a conqueror, and Job probably meant to describe some such mighty man, who was regardless alike of the rights of the high and the low.<p>He riseth up - When he rises up; that is, when he enters on an enterprise, or goes forth to accomplish his wicked purposes.<p>And no man is sure of life - From the dread of him even the great and mighty have no security. This language will well describe the character of an Oriental despot. Having absolute power, no man, not even the highest in rank, can feel that his life is safe if the monarch becomes in any way offended. Yet, Job says that even such a despot was permitted to live in prosperity, and to die without any remarkable proof of the divine displeasure. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/24.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22-25.

Some understand this of the punishment of wicked men, and interpret it, as Jarchi does, of God's drawing him to punishment; God sometimes does indeed draw and hurl the mighty from their seats; though they are set in high, yet in slippery places, and are brought down to destruction in a moment; and he will draw them all to his judgment seat hereafter, whether they will or not, and send them into everlasting punishment; but the former sense is best: <p>he riseth up, and no man is sure of life; he rises up in the morning:, either from his bed, or from his lurking place, where he was all night with a murdering intention, and no man he meets with is safe, but in the utmost danger of his life, <a href="/job/24-14.htm">Job 24:14</a>; or, he rises in the world to great power and dignity, and increases in wealth and riches, which he abuses to the hurt of others; so that they flee from him and hide themselves, not caring to trust their life with him, <a href="/proverbs/28-28.htm">Proverbs 28:28</a>; or he riseth up against a man in an hostile way, and against whomsoever he does, they are in the utmost jeopardy, and cannot be secure of their lives; though this also is by some interpreted as the punishment of a wicked man, who, when he rises in the morning, "trusteth not his own life" (f), as the words may be rendered, and as they are in the margin of our Bibles; but his life is in suspense, being surrounded with a thousand dangers, and has no assurance of it, and is in continual fear, and often fears where no fear is; see <a href="/deuteronomy/28-66.htm">Deuteronomy 28:66</a>; or, if a man rises up against him, the wicked tyrant and cruel oppressor, he the tyrant is not sure of his life but may be slain by him that rises up against him; but the former sense is best. <p>(f)  "non fidit suae vitae", Tigurine version, Piscator; so V.

Kidduschin, 24 b. According to the Talmud, Ralbag, and the ancient Jewish interpretation in general, <a href="/job/24-16.htm">Job 24:16</a> is closely connected to btym: houses which they have marked by day for breaking into, and the mode of its accomplishment; but &#1495;&#1514;&#1501; nowhere signifies designare, always obsignare, to seal up, to put under lock and key, <a href="/job/14-17.htm">Job 14:17</a>; <a href="/job/9-7.htm">Job 9:7</a>; <a href="/job/37-7.htm">Job 37:7</a>; according to which the Piel, which occurs only here, is to be explained: by day they seal up, i.e., shut themselves up for their safety (&#1500;&#1502;&#1493; is not to be accented with Athnach, but with Rebia mugrasch): they know not the light, i.e., as Schlottm. well explains: they have no fellowship with it; for the biblical &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;, &#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, mostly signifies a knowledge which enters into the subject, and intimately unites itself with it. In <a href="/job/24-17.htm">Job 24:17</a> one confirmation follows another. Umbr. and Hirz. explain: for the morning is to them at once the shadow of death; but &#1497;&#1495;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;, in the signification at the same time, as we have taken &#1497;&#1495;&#1491; in <a href="/job/17-16.htm">Job 17:16</a> (nevertheless of simultaneousness of time), is unsupportable: it signifies together, <a href="/job/2-11.htm">Job 2:11</a>; <a href="/job/9-32.htm">Job 9:32</a>; and the arrangement of the words &#1500;&#1502;&#1493;...&#1497;&#1495;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493; (to them together) is like <a href="/isaiah/9-20.htm">Isaiah 9:20</a>; <a href="/isaiah/31-3.htm">Isaiah 31:3</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/46-12.htm">Jeremiah 46:12</a>. Also, apart from the erroneous translation of the &#1497;&#1495;&#1491;&#1493;, which is easily set aside, Hirzel's rendering of <a href="/job/24-17.htm">Job 24:17</a> is forced: the morning, i.e., the bright day, is to them all as the shadow of death, for each and every one of them knows the terrors of the daylight, which is to them as the shadow of death, viz., the danger of being discovered and condemned. The interpretation, which is also preferred by Olshausen, is far more natural: the depth of night is to them as the dawn of the morning (on the precedence of the predicate, comp. <a href="/amos/4-13.htm">Amos 4:13</a> and <a href="/amos/5-8.htm">Amos 5:8</a> : walking in the darkness of the early morning), for they are acquainted with the terrors of the depth of night, i.e., they are not surprised by them, but know how to anticipate and to escape them. <a href="/job/38-15.htm">Job 38:15</a> also, where the night, which vanishes before the rising of the sun, is called the "light" of the evil-doer, favours this interpretation (not the other, as Olsh. thinks). The accentuation also favours it; for is &#1489;&#1511;&#1512; had been the subj., and were to be translated: the morning is to them the shadow of death, it ought to have been accented &#1489;&#1511;&#1512; &#1500;&#1502;&#1493; &#1510;&#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, Dech, Mercha, Athnach. It is, however, accented Munach, Munach, Athnach, and the second Munach stands as the deputy of Dech, whose value in the interpunction it represents; therefore &#1489;&#1511;&#1512; &#1500;&#1502;&#1493; is the predicate: the shadow of death is morning to them. From the plur. the description now, with &#1497;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;, passes into the sing., as individualizing it. &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;&#1493;&#1514; constr. of &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1514;, is without a Dagesh in the second consonant. Mercier admirably remarks here: sunt ei familiares et noti nocturni terrores, neque eos timet aut curat, quasi sibi cum illis necessitudo et familiaritas intercederet et cum illis ne noceant foedus aut pactum inierit. Thus by their skill and contrivance they escape danger, and divine justice allows them to remain undiscovered and unpunished, - a fact which is most incomprehensible.<p>It is now time that this thought was once again definitely expressed, that one may not forget what these accumulated illustrations are designed to prove. But what now follows in <a href="/job/24-18.htm">Job 24:18</a> seems to express not Job's opinion, but that of his opponents. Ew., Hirz., and Hlgst. regard <a href="//biblehub.com/job/24-18.htm">Job 24:18</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/24-22.htm">Job 24:22</a>, as thesis and antithesis. To the question, What is the lot that befalls all these evil-doers? Job is thought to give a twofold answer: first, to <a href="//biblehub.com/job/24-21.htm">Job 24:21</a>, an ironical answer in the sense of the friends, that those men are overtaken by the merited punishment; then from <a href="/job/24-22.htm">Job 24:22</a> is his own serious answer, which stands in direct contrast to the former. But (1) in <a href="/job/24-18.htm">Job 24:18</a> there is not the slightest trace observable that Job does not express his own view: a consideration which is also against Schlottman, who regards <a href="/job/24-18.htm">Job 24:18</a> as expressive of the view of an opponent. (2) There is no such decided contrast between <a href="/job/24-18.htm">Job 24:18</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/job/24-22.htm">Job 24:22</a>, for <a href="/job/24-19.htm">Job 24:19</a> and <a href="/job/24-24.htm">Job 24:24</a> both affirm substantially the same thing concerning the end of the evil-doer. In like manner, it is also not to be supposed, with Stick., Lwenth., Bttch., Welte, and Hahn, that Job, outstripping the friends, as far as <a href="//biblehub.com/job/24-21.htm">Job 24:21</a>, describes how the evil-doer certainly often comes to a terrible end, and in <a href="/job/24-22.htm">Job 24:22</a> how the very opposite of this, however, is often witnessed; so that this consequently furnishes no evidence in support of the exclusive assertion of the friends. Moreover, <a href="/job/24-24.htm">Job 24:24</a> compared with <a href="//biblehub.com/job/24-19.htm">Job 24:19</a>, where there is nothing to indicate a direct contrast, is opposed to it; and <a href="//biblehub.com/job/24-22.htm">Job 24:22</a>, which has no appearance of referring to a direct contrast with what has been previously said, is opposed to such an antithetical rendering of the two final strophes. <a href="/job/24-22.htm">Job 24:22</a> might more readily be regarded as a transition to the antithesis, if <a href="/job/24-18.htm">Job 24:18</a> could, with Eichh., Schnurr., Dathe, Umbr., and Vaih., after the lxx, Syriac, and Jerome, be understood as optative: "Let such an one be light on the surface of the water, let ... be cursed, let him not turn towards," etc., but <a href="/job/24-18.htm">Job 24:18</a> is not of the optative form; and <a href="//biblehub.com/job/24-18.htm">Job 24:18</a>, where in that case &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1497;&#1508;&#1504;&#1492; would be expected, instead of &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1497;&#1508;&#1504;&#1492;, shows that <a href="//biblehub.com/job/24-18.htm">Job 24:18</a>, where, according to the syntax, the optative rendering is natural, is nevertheless not to be so rendered. The right interpretation is that which regards both <a href="/job/24-18.htm">Job 24:18</a> and <a href="/job/24-22.htm">Job 24:22</a> as Job's own view, without allowing him absolutely to contradict himself. Thus it is interpreted, e.g., by Rosenmller, who, however, as also Renan, errs in connecting <a href="/job/24-18.htm">Job 24:18</a> with the description of the thieves, and understands <a href="/job/24-18.htm">Job 24:18</a> of their slipping away, <a href="/job/24-18.htm">Job 24:18</a> of their dwelling in horrible places, and <a href="/job/24-18.htm">Job 24:18</a> of their avoidance of the vicinity of towns. </body></html>
