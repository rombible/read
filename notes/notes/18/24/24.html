They are taken off with other men, as the harvestman gathers the ears of corn as they come to hand. There will often appear much to resemble the wrong view of Providence Job takes in this chapter. But we are taught by the word of inspiration, that these notions are formed in ignorance, from partial views. The providence of God, in the affairs of men, is in every thing a just and wise providence. Let us apply this whenever the Lord may try us. He cannot do wrong. The unequalled sorrows of the Son of God when on earth, unless looked at in this view, perplex the mind. But when we behold him, as the sinner's Surety, bearing the curse, we can explain why he should endure that wrath which was due to sin, that Divine justice might be satisfied, and his people saved.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They are exalted for a little while - This was the proposition which Job was maintaining. His friends affirmed that the wicked were punished for their sins in this life, and that great crimes would soon meet with great calamities. This Job denies, and says that the fact was, that they were "exalted." Yet he knew that it was to be but for a little time, and he believed that they would, at no distant period, receive the proper reward of their deeds. He maintains, however, that their death might be tranquil and easy, and that no extraordinary proof of the divine displeasure would be perceived in the manner of their departure.<p>But are gone and brought low - Margin, "not." Hebrew &#1493;&#1488;&#1497;&#1504;&#1504;&#1493;  ve'ay&#305;&#770;nenu&#770; - "and are not;" compare <a href="/genesis/42-13.htm">Genesis 42:13</a>. "The youngest is this day with our father, and one is not;" <a href="/genesis/37-30.htm">Genesis 37:30</a>. "The child is not, and I, whither shall I go?" That is, the child is dead; compare the expression Troja fuit. The meaning here is, that they soon disappear, or vanish.<p>They are taken out of the way as all other - They die in the same manner as other people do, and without any extraordinary expressions of the divine displeasure in their death. This was directly contrary to what his friends had maintained. The Hebrew word here (&#1511;&#1508;&#1509;  qa&#770;phats) means, "to gather", "to collect"; and is often used in the sense of "gathering to one's fathers," to denote death.<p>And cut off as the tops of the ears of corn - Of wheat, barley, or similar grain. Corn, in the sense in which the word is commonly used in this country, was not known in the time of Job. The allusion here is to the harvest. When the grain was ripe, it seems they were in the habit of cutting off the ears, and not of cutting it near the root, as we do. The body of the stalk was left, and, hence, there is so frequent allusion in the Scriptures to stubble that was burned. So, in Egypt, the children of Israel were directed to obtain the stubble left in the fields, in making brick, instead of having straw furnished them. The meaning of Job here is, that they would not be taken away by a violent death, or before their time, but that they would be like grain standing in the field to the time of harvest, and then peacefully gathered; compare <a href="/psalms/73-4.htm">Psalm 73:4</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/24.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24.

First, it comes on them when they have risen to eminence, have gained themselves a reputation, and "are exalted." Next, it is sudden and painless, preceded by no long, lingering illness, but just a sinking into non-existence; a tranquil passing away. Thirdly, it is at a ripe age, when they have reached the full term of human life, and are as ears of corn ripe for the harvest.

We may gather from this expression that the reaping in the land of Uz was conducted in Job's time much in the same way as it was in Egypt under the early Pharaohs, viz. by cutting the stalk with a sharp sickle almost immediately below the ear, and collecting the ears in baskets (see the author's 'Hist. of Ancient Egypt,' vol. 1. p. 162; and his 'Herodotus,' vol. 2. p. 59, 3rd edit.). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/24.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>18  For he is light upon the surface of the water;<p>Their heritage is cursed upon the earth;<p>He turneth no more in the way of the vineyard.<p>19  Drought, also heat, snatch away snow water - <p>So doth Shel those who have sinned.<p>20  The womb forgetteth him, worms shall feast on him,<p>He is no more remembered;<p>So the desire of the wicked is broken as a tree - <p>21  He who hath plundered the barren that bare not,<p>And did no good to the widow.<p>The point of comparison in <a href="/job/24-18.htm">Job 24:18</a> is the swiftness of the disappearing: he is carried swiftly past, as any light substance on the surface of the water is hurried along by the swiftness of the current, and can scarcely be seen; comp. <a href="/job/9-26.htm">Job 9:26</a> : "My days shoot by as ships of reeds, as an eagle which dasheth upon its prey," and <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/10-7.htm">Hosea 10:7</a>, "Samaria's king is destroyed like a bundle of brushwood (lxx, Theod., &#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;) on the face of the water," which is quickly drawn into the whirlpool, or buried by the approaching wave.<p>(Note: The translation: like foam (spuma or bulla), is also very suitable here. Thus Targ., Symm., Jerome, and others; but the signification to foam cannot be etymologically proved, whereas &#1511;&#1510;&#1507; in the signification confringere is established by &#1511;&#1510;&#1508;&#1492;, breaking, <a href="//biblehub.com/joel/1-7.htm">Joel 1:7</a>, and Arab. qs&#803;f; so that consequently &#1511;&#1510;&#1507;, as synon. of &#1488;&#1507;, signifies properly the breaking forth, and is then allied to &#1488;&#1489;&#1512;&#1492;.)<p>But here the idea is not that of being swallowed up by the waters, as in the passage in Hosea, but, on the contrary, of vanishing from sight, by being carried rapidly past by the rush of the waters. If, then, the evil-doer dies a quick, easy death, his heritage (&#1495;&#1500;&#1511;&#1492;, from &#1495;&#1500;&#1511;, to divide) is cursed by men, since no one will dwell in it or use it, because it is appointed by God to desolation on account of the sin which is connected with it (vid., on <a href="/job/15-28.htm">Job 15:28</a>); even he, the evil-doer, no more turns the way of the vineyard (&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492;, with &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498;, not an acc. of the obj., but as indicating the direction  equals  &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498;; comp. <a href="/1_samuel/13-18.htm">1 Samuel 13:18</a> with <a href="/1_samuel/13-17.htm">1 Samuel 13:17</a> of the same chapter), proudly to inspect his wide extended domain, and overlook the labourers. The curse therefore does not come upon him, nor can one any longer lie in wait for him to take vengeance on him; it is useless to think of venting upon him the rage which his conduct during life provoked; he is long since out of reach in Shel.<p>That which Job says figuratively in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/24-18.htm">Job 24:18</a>, and in <a href="/job/21-13.htm">Job 21:13</a> without a figure: "in a moment they go down to Shel," he expresses in <a href="/job/24-19.htm">Job 24:19</a> under a new figure, and, moreover, in the form of an emblematic proverb (vid., Herzog's Real-Encyklopdie, xiv. 696), according to the peculiarity of which, not &#1499;&#1468;&#1503;, but either only the copulative Waw (<a href="/proverbs/25-25.htm">Proverbs 25:25</a>) or nothing whatever (<a href="/proverbs/11-22.htm">Proverbs 11:22</a>), is to be supplied before &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1500; &#1495;&#1496;&#1488;&#1493;. &#1495;&#1496;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; is virtually an object: eos qui peccarunt. <a href="/job/24-19.htm">Job 24:19</a> is a model-example of extreme brevity of expression, Ges. 155, 4, b. Sandy ground (&#1510;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, arid land, without natural moisture), added to it (&#1490;&#1468;&#1501;, not: likewise) the heat of the sun - these two, working simultaneously from beneath and above, snatch away (&#1490;&#1468;&#1494;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;, cogn. &#1490;&#1468;&#1494;&#1512;, root &#1490;&#1494;, to cut, cut away, tear away; Arab. jzr, fut. i, used of sinking, decreasing water) &#1502;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497; &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1490;, water of (melted) snow (which is fed from no fountain, and therefore is quickly absorbed), and Shel snatches away those who have sinned ( equals  &#1490;&#1468;&#1494;&#1500;&#1492; &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1495;&#1496;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;). The two incidents are alike: the death of those whose life has been a life of sin, follows as a consequence easily and unobserved, without any painful and protracted struggle. The sinner disappears suddenly; the womb, i.e., the mother that bare him, forgets him (&#1512;&#1495;&#1501;, matrix  equals  mater; according to Ralbag: friendship, from &#1512;&#1495;&#1501;, to love tenderly; others: relationship, in which sense Arab. rah&#803;imun  equals  &#1512;&#1495;&#1501; is used), worms suck at him (&#1502;&#1514;&#1511;&#1493; for &#1502;&#1514;&#1511;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, according to Ges. 147, a, sugit eum, from which primary notion of sucking comes the signification to be sweet, <a href="/job/21-33.htm">Job 21:33</a> : Syriac, metkat ennun remto; Ar. imtasahum, from the synonymous Arab. mas&#803;s&#803;a  equals  &#1502;&#1510;&#1509;, &#1502;&#1510;&#1492;, &#1502;&#1494;&#1492;), he is no more thought of, and thus then is mischief (abstr. pro concr. as <a href="/job/5-16.htm">Job 5:16</a>) broken like a tree (not: a staff, which &#1506;&#1509; never, not even in <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/4-12.htm">Hosea 4:12</a>, directly, like the Arabic &#8219;asa, &#8219;asa&#770;t, signifies).

His want of compassion (as is still too often seen in the present day in connection with the tyrannical conduct of the executive in Syria and Palestine, especially on the part of those who collected the taxes) goes the length of eating up, i.e., entirely plundering, the barren, childless (<a href="/genesis/11-30.htm">Genesis 11:30</a>; <a href="/isaiah/54-1.htm">Isaiah 54:1</a>), and therefore helpless woman, who has no sons to protect and defend her, and never showing favour to the widow, but, on the contrary, thrusting her away from him. There is as little need for regarding the verb &#1512;&#1506;&#1492; here, with Rosenm. after the Targ., in the signification confringere, as cognate with &#1512;&#1506;&#1506;, &#1512;&#1510;&#1509;, as conversely to change &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1506;&#1501;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/2-9.htm">Psalm 2:9</a>, into &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1506;&#1501;; it signifies depascere, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/20-26.htm">Job 20:26</a>, here in the sense of depopulari.

Certainly the memory of such an one is not affectionately cherished; this is equally true with what Job maintains in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/21-32.htm">Job 21:32</a>, that the memory of the evil-doer is immortalized by monuments. Here the allusion is to the remembrance of a mother's love and sympathetic feeling. The fundamental thought of the strophe is this, that neither in life nor in death had he suffered the punishment of his evil-doing. The figure of the broken tree (broken in its full vigour) also corresponds to this thought; comp. on the other hand what Bildad says, <a href="/job/18-16.htm">Job 18:16</a> : "his roots dry up beneath, and above his branch is lopped off" (or: withered). The severity of his oppression is not manifest till after his death.<p>continued...</body></html>
