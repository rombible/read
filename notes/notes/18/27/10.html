If they gained through life by their profession, and kept up their presumptuous hope till death, what would that avail when God required their souls? The more comfort we find in our religion, the more closely we shall cleave to it. Those who have no delight in God, are easily drawn away by the pleasures, and easily overcome by the crosses of this life.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Will he delight himself in the Almighty? - A truly pious man will delight himself in the Almighty. His supreme happiness will be found in God. He has pleasure in the contemplation of his existence, his perfections, his law, and his government. Coverdale renders this, "Hath he such pleasure and delight in the Almighty that he dare alway call upon God?" The idea of Job is that a hypocrite has not his delight in the Almighty; and, therefore, his condition is not such as he would defend or choose. Job bad been charged with defending the character of the wicked and with maintaining that they were the objects of the divine favor. He now says that he maintained no such opinion. He was aware that the only real and solid happiness was to be found in God, and he knew that a hypocrite would not find delight there. This is true to the letter. A hypocrite has no real happiness in God. He sees nothing in the divine perfections to love; nothing in the divine plan affections. The hypocrite, therefore, is a miserable man. He professes to love what he does not love; tries to find pleasure in what his heart hates; mingles with a people with whom he has no sympathy, and joins in services of prayer and praise which are disgusting and irksome to his soul. The pious man rejoices that there is just such a God as Yahweh is. He sees nothing in him which he desires to be changed, and he has supreme delight in the contemplation of his perfections.<p>Will he always call upon God? - That is, he will not always call upon God. This is literally true. The hypocrite pray:<p>(1) when he makes a profession of religion;<p>(2) on some extraordinary occasion - as when a friend is sick, or when he feels that he himself is about to die, but he does not always maintain habits of prayer.<p>He suffers his business to break in upon his times for prayer; neglects secret devotion on the slightest pretence, and soon abandons it altogether. One of the best tests of character is the feeling with which we pray, and the habit which we have of calling on God. The man who loves secret prayer has one of the most certain evidences that he is a pious man; compare the notes at <a href="/job/20-5.htm">Job 20:5</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/27.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. Alluding to Job 22:26.<p>always call&#8212;He may do so in times of prosperity in order to be thought religious. But he will not, as I do, call on God in calamities verging on death. Therefore I cannot be a "hypocrite" (Job 19:25; 20:5; Ps 62:8).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/job/27.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Will he be able to delight and satisfy himself with God alone, and with his love and favour, when he hath no other matter of delight? This I now do, and this a hypocrite cannot do, because his heart is chiefly set upon the world; and when that fails him, his heart sinks, and the thoughts of God are unsavoury and troublesome to him. He may by his afflictions be driven to prayer: but if God doth not speedily answer him, he falls into despair, and neglect of God and of prayer; whereas I constantly continue in prayer, notwithstanding the grievousness and the long continuance of my calamities. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/job/27.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Will he delight himself in the Almighty?.... That is, the hypocrite; no, he will not; he may seem to delight in, him, but he does not truly and sincerely; not in him as the Almighty, or in his omnipotence, into whose hands it is a fearful thing to fall, and who is able to destroy soul and body in hell; nor his omniscience, who, searches and knows the hearts of all men, and the insincerity of the hypocrite, covert to men soever he is; nor in his holiness, which at heart he loves not; nor in his ways and worship, word, ordinances, and people, though he makes a show of it, <a href="/isaiah/58-2.htm">Isaiah 58:2</a>; <p>will he always call upon God? God only is to be called upon, and it becomes all men to call upon him for all blessings, temporal and spiritual; and this should be done in faith, with fervency, in sincerity and uprightness of soul, and with constancy, always, at all times both of prosperity and adversity; but an hypocrite does not, and cannot call upon God in a sincere and spiritual manner; nor is he constant in this work, only by fits and starts, when it is for his worldly interest and external honour so to do. Now Job was one that delighted in God, was uneasy at his absence, longed for communion with him, sought earnestly after him, frequently and constantly called upon him, though he was wrongly charged with casting off the fear of God, and restraining prayer before him, and therefore no hypocrite. Some understand (f) all this as affirmed of the hypocrite, setting forth his present seeming state of happiness; as that he has a hope of divine favour, and of eternal felicity; has much peace and tranquillity of mind in life, and at death; is heard of God when trouble comes, and so gets out of it, and enjoys great prosperity; professes much delight and pleasure in God, and his ways, and is a constant caller upon him, and keeps close to the external duties of religion; and yet, notwithstanding all this, is in the issue, when death comes, exceeding miserable, as the following part of the chapter shows. <p>(f) Schultens. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/27.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Will he delight himself in the Almighty? will he always call upon God?</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/job/27.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">10</span>. <span class="ital">will he delight himself</span>?] Or, <span class="bld">doth</span> he delight himself?

Such words as those in <span class="ital"><a href="/job/27-8.htm" title="For what is the hope of the hypocrite, though he has gained, when God takes away his soul?">Job 27:8</a>; <a href="/job/27-10.htm" title="Will he delight himself in the Almighty? will he always call on God?">Job 27:10</a></span>, are not out of place in the mouth of Job, comp. ch. <a href="/job/16-19.htm" title="Also now, behold, my witness is in heaven, and my record is on high.">Job 16:19</a> <span class="ital">seq</span>., <a href="/job/19-25.htm" title="For I know that my redeemer lives, and that he shall stand at the latter day on the earth:">Job 19:25</a> <span class="ital">seq</span>., <a href="/job/23-10.htm" title="But he knows the way that I take: when he has tried me, I shall come forth as gold.">Job 23:10</a> <span class="ital">seq</span>., <a href="/context/job/31-2.htm" title="For what portion of God is there from above? and what inheritance of the Almighty from on high?...">Job 31:2-6</a>. It is less easy, however, to combine what is implied in the words of <span class="ital"><a href="/job/27-9.htm" title="Will God hear his cry when trouble comes on him?">Job 27:9</a></span>, “Will God hear his cry when trouble cometh upon him?” with Job’s repeated complaints that God refused to hear him, e. g. ch. <a href="/job/13-24.htm" title="Why hide you your face, and hold me for your enemy?">Job 13:24</a>, <a href="/job/19-7.htm" title="Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry aloud, but there is no judgment.">Job 19:7</a>, and many other passages. The only solution would be to consider that he had fought his way through to an assured trust in God, such as he had cherished during his past life (ch. <a href="/job/12-4.htm" title="I am as one mocked of his neighbor, who calls on God, and he answers him: the just upright man is laughed to scorn.">Job 12:4</a> <span class="ital">seq</span>.), or rather, that such a trust here suddenly broke upon him and filled his mind, and enabled him to look now for release from his calamities and restoration—in a word to anticipate that issue of his afflictions which actually ensued. And such is the construction which some of the ablest commentators (e.g. Ewald) put upon the language. Such a change of view in regard to the issue of his afflictions implies a complete revolution in Job’s mind, for he had hitherto consistently and even pertinaciously (ch. <a href="/context/job/17-1.htm" title="My breath is corrupt, my days are extinct, the graves are ready for me....">Job 17:1-2</a>; <a href="/context/job/17-10.htm" title="But as for you all, do you return, and come now: for I cannot find one wise man among you....">Job 17:10-16</a>) contended that his malady was mortal, and continued to do this even so late as ch. <a href="/job/23-14.htm" title="For he performes the thing that is appointed for me: and many such things are with him.">Job 23:14</a>, “For he will perform the thing appointed for me.” Such a revolution, however, may be conceived and admitted, provided Job’s subsequent utterances are in harmony with it. Unfortunately, however, they are not; for in ch. <a href="/job/30-20.htm" title="I cry to you, and you do not hear me: I stand up, and you regard me not.">Job 30:20</a> he exclaims, “I cry unto thee and thou dost not hear me, I stand up and thou gazest at me”; and in <a href="/job/27-23.htm" title="Men shall clap their hands at him, and shall hiss him out of his place.">Job 27:23</a> of the same chapter he says, “For I know that thou wilt bring me unto death” (i. e. through his present afflictions). Here he is found again occupying the same position in regard to his malady under the hand of God as he had consistently maintained throughout. It is very hard to reconcile such expressions with ch. <a href="/context/job/27-7.htm" title="Let my enemy be as the wicked, and he that rises up against me as the unrighteous....">Job 27:7-10</a>, on the assumption that the last-named passage really belongs to Job.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Will he delight himself in the Almighty?</span> A further ill result of hypocrisy is noted. Not only does it alienate God from us, but it nile,ares us from God. The hypocrite cannot "delight in the Almighty." He must shriek from him, tear him, dislike to dwell on the thought of his presence and realize it. His natural inclination must be to withdraw his thoughts from God, and give himself up to the worldliness which has been his attraction to assume the hypocrite's part. <span class="cmt_word">Will he always call upon God?</span> Can be even be depended on not to renounce the service of God altogether? The mutual alienation above spoken of must tend to check communion, to disincline to prayer and calling upon God, to erect a barrier between the hypocrite and the Almighty, which, though for a while it may be insufficient to withstand the force of use and wont, will yet, in the long run, be sure to tell, and will either put an end to prayer altogether, or reduce it to a formality. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/27.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>  1  Then Job continued to take up his proverb, and said:<p>  2  As God liveth, who hath deprived me of my right,<p>And the Almighty, who hath sorely saddened my soul - <p>  3  For still all my breath is in me,<p>And the breath of Eloah in my nostrils - <p>  4  My lips do not speak what is false,<p>And my tongue uttereth not deceit!<p>  5  Far be it from me, to grant that you are in the right:<p>Till I die I will not remove my innocence from me.<p>  6  My righteousness I hold fast, and let it not go:<p>My heart reproacheth not any of my days.<p>  7  Mine enemy must appear as an evil-doer,<p>And he who riseth up against me as unrighteous.<p>The friends are silent, Job remains master of the discourse, and his continued speech is introduced as a continued &#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1514; &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493; (after the analogy of the phrase &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488; &#1511;&#1493;&#1500;), as in <a href="/numbers/23-7.htm">Numbers 23:7</a> and further on, the oracles of Balaam. &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500; is speech of a more elevated tone and more figurative character; here, as frequently, the unaffected outgrowth of an elevated solemn mood.
