So long the oath of God would be upon him, or he bound himself under it: <p>and the spirit of God is in my nostrils; which signifies the same thing. The breath of a man is his spirit, and this is of God, the Father of spirits; he first breathed into man the breath of life, and he became a living soul or spirit, <a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>; it is he that gives life and breath to every man, <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/17-25.htm">Acts 17:25</a>, and continues it as long as he pleases, which is a very precarious thing; for it is in his nostrils, where it is drawn to and fro and soon and easily stopped; nor will it always continue, it will some time not be, it will go forth, and then man dies, and returns to the earth, <a href="/ecclesiastes/12-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:7</a>; but as long as there is breath there is life; so that to say this is the same as to say, as long as I live, or have a being, <a href="/psalms/104-33.htm">Psalm 104:33</a>; and while that continued, Job looked upon himself under the oath he had taken by the living God. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/27.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">All the while my breath is in me, and the spirit of God is in my nostrils;</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/job/27.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">3</span>. <span class="ital">all the while</span>] The sense is rather as given above, according to the parallel passage, <a href="/2_samuel/1-9.htm" title="He said to me again, Stand, I pray you, on me, and slay me: for anguish is come on me, because my life is yet whole in me.">2 Samuel 1:9</a>.

The spirit of God, originally  breathed into man's nostrils, whereby he became a living soul (<a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>), is still, Job says, within him, and makes him capable of judging and declaring what is right. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/26.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>11  The pillars of heaven tremble<p>And are astonished at His threatening.<p>12  By His power He rouseth up the sea,<p>And by His understanding He breaketh Rahab in pieces.<p>13  By His breath the heavens become cheerful;<p>His hand hath formed the fugitive dragon.<p>The mountains towering up to the sky, which seem to support the vault of the sky, are called poetically "the pillars of heaven." &#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1508;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468; is Pulal, like &#1497;&#1495;&#1493;&#1500;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;, <a href="/job/26-5.htm">Job 26:5</a>; the signification of violent and quick motion backwards and forwards is secured to the verb &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507; by the Targ. &#1488;&#1514;&#1512;&#1493;&#1508;&#1507;  equals  &#1492;&#1514;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1509;, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/9-6.htm">Job 9:6</a>, and the Talm. &#1512;&#1508;&#1512;&#1507; of churned milk, blinding eyes (comp. &#1492;&#1512;&#1507; &#1506;&#1497;&#1503;, the twinkling of the eye, and Arab. rff, fut. i. o. nictare), flapping wings (comp. Arab. rff and rfrf, movere, motitare alas), of wavering thinking. &#1490;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;&#1492; is the divine command which looses or binds the powers of nature; the astonishment of the supports of heaven is, according to the radical signification of &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492;&#1468; (cogn. &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1501;), to be conceived of as a torpidity which follows the divine impulse, without offering any resistance whatever. That &#1512;&#1490;&#1506;, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/26-12.htm">Job 26:12</a>, is to be understood transitively, not like <a href="//biblehub.com/job/7-5.htm">Job 7:5</a>, intransitively, is proved by the dependent (borrowed) passages, <a href="/isaiah/51-15.htm">Isaiah 51:15</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-35.htm">Jeremiah 31:35</a>, from which it is also evident that &#1512;&#1490;&#1506; cannot with the lxx be translated &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;. The verb combines in itself the opposite significations of starting up, i.e., entering into an excited state, and of being startled, from which the significations of stilling (Niph., Hiph.), and of standing back or retreat (Arab. rj&#8219;), branch off. The conjecture &#1490;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512; after the Syriac version (which translates, go&#8219;ar bejamo) is superfluous. &#1512;&#1492;&#1489;, which here also is translated by the lxx &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, has been discussed already on <a href="/job/9-13.htm">Job 9:13</a>. It is not meant of the turbulence of the sea, to which &#1502;&#1495;&#1509; is not appropriate, but of a sea monster, which, like the crocodile and the dragon, are become an emblem of Pharaoh and his power, as <a href="/isaiah/51-9.htm">Isaiah 51:9</a>. has applied this primary passage: the writer of the book of Job purposely abstains from such references to the history of Israel. Without doubt, &#1512;&#1492;&#1489; denotes a demoniacal monster, like the demons that shall be destroyed at the end of the world, one of which is called by the Persians akomano, evil thought, another taromaiti, pride. This view is supported by <a href="//biblehub.com/job/26-13.htm">Job 26:13</a>, where one is not at liberty to determine the meaning by <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/51-9.htm">Isaiah 51:9</a>, and to understand &#1504;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473; &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1495;, like &#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503; in that passage, of Egypt. But this dependent passage is an important indication for the correct rendering of &#1495;&#1500;&#1500;&#1492;. One thing is certain at the outset, that &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1512;&#1492; is not perf. Piel  equals  &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1512;&#1492;, and for this reason, that the Dagesh which characterizes Piel cannot be omitted from any of the six mutae; the translation of Jerome, spiritus ejus ornavit coelos, and all similar ones, are therefore false. But it is possible to translate: "by His spirit (creative spirit) the heavens are beauty, His hand has formed the flying dragon." Thus, in the signification to bring forth (as <a href="/proverbs/25-23.htm">Proverbs 25:23</a>; <a href="/proverbs/8-24.htm">Proverbs 8:24</a>.), &#1495;&#1500;&#1500;&#1492; is rendered by Rosenm., Arnh., Vaih., Welte, Renan, and others, of whom Vaih. and Renan, however, do not understand <a href="/job/26-13.htm">Job 26:13</a> of the creation of the heavens, but of their illumination. By this rendering <a href="/job/26-13.htm">Job 26:13</a> and <a href="/job/26-13.htm">Job 26:13</a> are severed, as being without connection; in general, however, the course of thought in the description does not favour the reference of the whole of half of <a href="/job/26-13.htm">Job 26:13</a> to the creation. Accordingly, &#1495;&#1500;&#1500;&#1492; is not to be taken as Pilel from &#1495;&#1493;&#1500; (&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;), but after <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/57-9.htm">Isaiah 57:9</a>, as Poel from &#1495;&#1500;&#1500;, according to which the idea of <a href="/job/26-13.htm">Job 26:13</a> is determined, since both lines of the verse are most closely connected.<p>(&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1495;) &#1504;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473; &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1495; is, to wit, the constellation of the Dragon, <p>(Note: Ralbag, without any ground for it, understands it of the milky way (&#1492;&#1506;&#1490;&#1493;&#1500; &#1492;&#1495;&#1500;&#1489;&#1497;), which, according to Rapoport, Pref. to Slonimski's Toledoth ha-schamajim (1838), was already known to the Talmud b. Berachoth, 58 b, under the name of &#1504;&#1492;&#1512; &#1491;&#1504;&#1493;&#1491;.)<p>one of the most straggling constellations, which winds itself between the Greater and Lesser Bears almost half through the polar circle.<p>"Maximus hic plexu sinuoso elabitur Anguis<p>Circum perque duas in morem fluminis Arctos."<p>(Virgil, Georg. i.244f.)<p>continued...</body></html>
