Job had confidence in the goodness both of his cause and of his God; and cheerfully committed his cause to him. But Job had not due reverence when he spake of God as taking away his judgment, and vexing his soul.

I cannot, will not, part with that. Job had lost his property, his health, and his domestic comforts, but he had in all this one consolation - he felt that he was sincere. He had been subjected to calamity by God as if he were a wicked man, but still he was resolved to adhere to the consciousness of his uprightness. Property may leave a man; friends may forsake him; children may die; disease may attack him; slander may assail him; and death may approach him; but still he may have in his bosom one unfailing source of consolation; he may have the consciousness that his aim has been right and pure. That nothing can shake; of that, no storms or tempests, no malignant foe, no losses or disappointment, no ridicule or calumny, can deprive him.<p>My heart shall not reproach me - That is, as being insincere, false, hollow.<p>So long as I live - Margin, "from my days."

Meaning not his personal righteousness, or the righteousness of his works, as his justifying righteousness before God, and for acceptance with him; which no man that is convinced of the insufficiency of, as Job was, will hold fast, but renounce, and desire, with the Apostle Paul, not to be found in it, <a href="/philippians/3-9.htm">Philippians 3:9</a>. Indeed the righteousness of his living Redeemer, which was his, and he might call so, this he knew, and knew he should be justified by it, and which he laid hold upon by faith in the strong exercise of it, and would not drop it, or become remiss in it, but retain it, and constantly make mention of it, and plead it as his justifying righteousness with God; but here he intends the righteousness of his cause, which he always maintained strongly, and was determined he ever would, and never give way, or let it drop, but continue to affirm, that he was a righteous man, and that it was not for any unrighteousness he had done to any man that God dealt thus with him; he had wronged no man, he had done justice to all men, as well as he was not devoid of the fear of God, and piety towards him; and this character of himself he would never give up, but defend to the uttermost: <p>my heart shall not reproach me so long as I live; not that he imagined he should or could live without sin, so that his conscience could never charge, accuse, or upbraid him with it; for there is no man, let him live a life ever so harmless and inoffensive to God and man, but his heart will smite him, and condemn him for his sins committed in thought, word, and deed: but Job's sense is, that he would never deny his integrity, or renounce the righteousness of his cause, and own himself to be an insincere and unrighteous man; should he do this, he should speak contrary to his own conscience, which would accuse and reproach him for so saying, and therefore he was determined it never should; for, as long as he lived, he neither could nor would say any such thing. Some render the last phrase, "for my days" (c), or "concerning" them; for my course of life, all my days, so Jarchi; for that my heart shall not reproach me, as being conscious to himself he had lived in all good conscience to that day, and trusted he ever should; but the sense before given is best. <p>(c) "propter dies meos", Munster; "vel propter dies vitae meae", Michaelis; "de diebus meis", Schultens. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/27.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: my heart shall not reproach <i>me</i> so long as I <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> live.</span><p>(e) Of my life past.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/job/27.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>.

Of course the words have reference to the kind of charges laid against Job by his friends (e.g. ch. <a href="/context/job/22-6.htm" title="For you have taken a pledge from your brother for nothing, and stripped the naked of their clothing....">Job 22:6-9</a>), and not to the sinfulness of nature common to all men, ch. <a href="/job/14-2.htm" title="He comes forth like a flower, and is cut down: he flees also as a shadow, and continues not.">Job 14:2</a>. The “heart” in Heb. is the <span class="ital">conscience</span> or consciousness. Luther expresses the meaning vigorously when he translates: “My conscience bites me not in respect of my whole life.” Comp. the whole of ch. 31, which is but an expansion of these words.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My righteousness I held fast, and will not let it go</span>. Not only will Job never cease to maintain his integrity in the past, but he will hold fast to the same course of blameless life in the future. He will not "curse God, and die." Resolutely he will maintain his faith in God, and his dependence on him. "Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him." <span class="cmt_word">My heart shall not reproach me so long as I live</span>. This is probably the true meaning, though some suggest "My heart doth not reproach me for any of my days" Job determines to "have always a conscience void of offence, both toward God and toward man" (<a href="/acts/24-16.htm">Acts 24:16</a>; comp. <a href="/acts/23-1.htm">Acts 23:1</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/4-4.htm">1 Corinthians 4:4</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/1-3.htm">2 Timothy 1:3</a>; <a href="/1_john/3-21.htm">1 John 3:21</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/26.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>14  Behold, these are the edges of His ways,<p>And how do we hear only a whisper thereof!<p>But the thunder of His might - who comprehendeth it?<p>These (&#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; retrospective, as in <a href="/job/18-21.htm">Job 18:21</a>) are only &#1511;&#1510;&#1493;&#1514;, the extremest end-points or outlines of the ways of God, which Job has depicted; the wondrous fulness of His might, which extends through the whole creation, transcends human comprehension; it is only &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1509; &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; therefrom that becomes audible to us men. &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1509; (&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1509;) is translated by Symm. here &#x3c8;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/4-12.htm">Job 4:12</a>, &#x3c8;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;; the Arab. s&#780;amis&#803;a (to speak very quickly, mutter) confirms this idea of the word; Jerome's translation, vix. parvam stillam sermonis ejus (comp. <a href="//biblehub.com/job/4-12.htm">Job 4:12</a>, venas, tropical for parts), is doubly erroneous: the rendering of the &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1509; has the antithesis of &#1512;&#1506;&#1501; against it, and &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; is not to be understood here otherwise than in &#1506;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;, <a href="/deuteronomy/23-15.htm">Deuteronomy 23:15</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/24-1.htm">Deuteronomy 24:1</a> : shame of something  equals  something that excites a feeling of shame, a whisper of something  equals  some whisper. The notion "somewhat," which the old expositors attribute to &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1509;, lies therefore in &#1491;&#1489;&#1512;. &#1502;&#1492; is exclamatory in a similar manner as in <a href="/psalms/89-48.htm">Psalm 89:48</a> : how we hear (&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;, not &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;) only some whisper thereof (&#1489;&#1468;&#1493; partitive, as e.g., <a href="/isaiah/10-22.htm">Isaiah 10:22</a>), i.e., how little therefrom is audible to us, only as the murmur of a word, not loud and distinct, which reaches us!<p>As in the speech of Bildad the poet makes the opposition of the friends to fade away and cease altogether, as incapable of any further counsel, and hence as conquered, so in Job's closing speech, which consists of three parts, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/26-1.htm">Job 26:1</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/27-1.htm">Job 27:1</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/29-1.htm">Job 29:1</a>, he shows how Job in every respect, as victor, maintains the field against the friends. The friends have neither been able to loose the knot of Job's lot of suffering, nor the universal distribution of prosperity and misfortune. Instead of loosing the knot of Job's lot of suffering, they have cut it, by adding to Job's heavy affliction the invention of heinous guilt as its ground of explanation; and the knot of the contradictions of human life in general with divine justice they have ignored, in order that they may not be compelled to abandon their dogma, that suffering everywhere necessarily presupposes sin, and sin is everywhere necessarily followed by suffering. Even Job, indeed, is not at present able to solve either one or other of the mysteries; but while the friends' treatment of these mysteries is untrue, he honours the truth, and keenly perceives that which is mysterious. Then he proves by testimony and an appeal to facts, that the mystery may be acknowledged without therefore being compelled to abandon the fear of God. Job firmly holds to the objective reality and the testimony of his consciousness; in the fear of God he places himself above all those contradictions which are unsolvable by and perplexing to human reason; his faith triumphs over the rationalism of the friends, which is devoid of truth, of justice, and of love.<p>Job first answers Bildad, <a href="/job/26-1.htm">Job 26:1</a>. He characterizes his poor reply as what it is: as useless, and not pertinent in regard to the questions before them: it is of no service to him, it does not affect him, and is, moreover, a borrowed weapon. For he also is conscious of and can praise God's exalted and awe-inspiring majesty. He has already shown this twice, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/9-4.htm">Job 9:4-10</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/12-13.htm">Job 12:13-25</a>, and shows here for the third time: its operation is not confined merely to those creatures that immediately surround God in the heavens; it extends, without being restrained by the sea, even down to the lower world; and as it makes the angels above to tremble, so there it sets the shades in consternation. From the lower world, Job's contemplation rises to the earth, as a body suspended in space without support; to the clouds above, which contain the upper waters without bursting, and veil the divine throne, of which the sapphire blue of heaven is the reflection; and then he speaks of the sea lying between Shel and heaven, which is confined within fixed bounds, at the extreme boundaries of which light passes over into darkness; - he celebrates all this as proof of the creative might of God. Then he describes the sovereign power of God in the realm of His creation, how He shakes the pillars of heaven, rouses the sea, breaks the monster in pieces, lights up the heavens by chasing away the clouds and piercing the serpent, and thus setting free the sun. But all these - thus he closes - are only meagre outlines of the divine rule, only a faint whisper, which is heard by us as coming from the far distance. Who has the comprehension necessary to take in and speak exhaustively of all the wonders of His infinite nature, which extends throughout the whole creation? From such a profound recognition and so glorious a description of the exaltation of God, the infinite distance between God and man is most clearly proved. Job has adequately shown that his whole soul is full of that which Bildad is anxious to teach him; a soul that only requires a slight impulse to make it overflow with such praise of God, as is not wanting in an universal perception of God, nor is it full of wicked devices. When therefore Bildad maintains against Job that no man is righteous before such an exalted God, Job ought indeed to take it as a warning against such unbecoming utterances concerning God as those which have escaped him; but the universal sinfulness of man is no ground of explanation for his sufferings, for there is a righteousness which avails before God; and of this, job, the suffering servant of God, has a consciousness that cannot be shaken. </body></html>
