Probably he had paused for Zophar to reply, but since he said nothing he now resumed his argument.<p>His parable - A parable properly denotes a comparison of one thing with another, or a fable or allegorical representation from which moral instruction is derived. It was a favorite mode of conveying truth in the East, and indeed is found in all countries; see the notes at <a href="/matthew/13-3.htm">Matthew 13:3</a>. It is evident, however, that Job did not deliver his sentiments in this manner; and the word rendered "parable" here (&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;  ma&#770;sha&#770;l) means, as it often does, a sententious discourse or argument. The word is used in the Scriptures to denote a parable, properly so called; then a sententious saying; an apothegm; a proverb; or a poem or song; see the notes at <a href="/isaiah/14-4.htm">Isaiah 14:4</a>. It is rendered here by the Vulgate, parabolam; by the Septuagint, &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#837;  prooimio&#772; - "Job spake by preface;" Luther, fuhr fort - Job continued; Noyes, discourse; Good, high argument.

Having finished his discourse concerning the worlds and ways of God, and the display of his majesty, power, and glory, in them, he pauses awhile, waiting for Zophar, whose turn was next to rise up, and make a reply to him; but neither he, nor any of his friends, reassumed the debate, but kept a profound silence, and chose not to carry on the dispute any further with him; either concluding him to be an obstinate man, not open to conviction, and on whom no impressions could be made, and that it was all lost time and labour to use any argument with him; or else being convicted in their minds that he was in the right, and they in the wrong, though they did not choose to own it; and especially being surprised with what he had last said concerning God and his works, whereby they perceived he had great knowledge of divine things, and could not be the man they had suspected him to be from his afflictions: however, though they are silent, Job was not, "he added to take or lift up his parable" (a), as the words may be rendered; or his oration, as Mr. Broughton, his discourse; which, because it consisted of choice and principal things, which command regard and attention, of wise, grave, serious, and sententious sayings, and some of them such as not easy to be understood, being delivered in similes and figurative expressions, as particularly in the following chapter, it is called his parable; what are called parables being proverbial phrases, dark sayings, allegorical or metaphorical expressions, and the like; and which way of speaking Job is here said to take, "and lift up", which is an eastern phraseology, as appears from Balaam's use of it, <a href="/numbers/23-7.htm">Numbers 23:7</a>; and may signify, that he delivered the following oration with great freedom, boldness, and confidence, and with a high tone and loud voice; to all which he might be induced by observing, through the silence of his friends, that he had got the advantage of them, and had carried his point, and had brought them to conviction or confusion, or however to silence, which gave him heart and spirit to proceed on with his oration, which he added to his former discourse: <p>and said; as follows. <p>(a)   "et addidit assumere suam parabolam", Pagninus, Montanus. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/27.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Moreover Job continued his parable, and said,</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-23.</span> - This chapter divides itself into three distinct portions. In the first, which extends to the end of ver. 6, Job is engaged in maintaining, with the utmost possible solemnity (ver. 2), both his actual integrity (ver. 6) and his determination to hold fast his integrity as long as he lives (vers. 4-6). In the second (vers. 7-10) he implicates a curse upon his enemies. In the third (vers. 11-23) he returns to the consideration of God's treatment of the wicked, and retracts the view which he had maintained controversially in <a href="/job/24-2.htm">Job 24:2-24</a>, with respect to their prosperity, impunity, and equalization with the righteous in death. The retractation is so complete, the concessions are so large, that some have been induced to question whether they can possibly have been made by Job, and have been led on to suggest that we have here a third speech of Zophar's, such as "the symmetry of the general form" requires, which by accident or design has been transferred from him to Job. But the improbability of such a transfer, considering how in the Book of Job the speech of each separate interlocutor is introduced, is palpable; the dissimilarity between the speech and the other utterances of Zophar is striking; and (;he judgment of two such liberal critics as Ewald and Renan, that the passage is rightly placed, and rightly assigned to Job, should set all doubt at rest, and make an end of controversy (see Mr. Froude's 'Short Studies on Great Subjects,' vol. 1 pp. 315, 316; and Canon Cook's "Introduction to the Book of Job," in the 'Speaker's Commentary,' vol. 4. p. 7). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Moreover Job continued his parable, and said</span>. The word translated "parable" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5dc;</span>) is only used previously in <a href="/numbers/23.htm">Numbers 23</a>, and 24. It is thought to "comprehend all discourses in which the results of discursive thought are concisely or figuratively expressed" (Cook). The introduction of a new term seems to imply that the present discourse occupies a position different from that of all the preceding ones. It is not tentative, controversial, or emotional, but expresses the deliberate judgment of the patriarch on the subjects discussed in it. Note the repetition of the term in <a href="/job/29-1.htm">Job 29:1</a>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/26.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>  8  He bindeth up the waters in His clouds,<p>Without the clouds being rent under their burden.<p>  9  He enshroudeth the face of His throne,<p>Spreading His clouds upon it.<p>10  He compasseth the face of the waters with bounds,<p>To the boundary between light and darkness.<p>The clouds consist of masses of water rolled together, which, if they were suddenly set free, would deluge the ground; but the omnipotence of God holds the waters together in the hollow of the clouds (&#1510;&#1512;&#1512;, Milel, according to a recognised law, although it is also found in Codd. accented as Milra, but contrary to the Masora), so that they do not burst asunder under the burden of the waters (&#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501;); by which nothing more nor less is meant, than that the physical and meteorological laws of rain are of God's appointment. <a href="/job/26-9.htm">Job 26:9</a> describes the dark and thickly-clouded sky that showers down the rain in the appointed rainy season. &#1488;&#1495;&#1494; signifies to take hold of, in architecture to hold together by means of beams, or to fasten together (vid., Thenius on <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/6-10.htm">1 Kings 6:10</a>, comp. <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-18.htm">2 Chronicles 9:18</a>, &#1502;&#1488;&#1495;&#1494;&#1497;&#1501;, coagmentata), then also, as usually in Chald. and Syr., to shut (by means of cross-bars, <a href="/nehemiah/7-3.htm">Nehemiah 7:3</a>), here to shut off by surrounding with clouds: He shuts off &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1470;&#1499;&#1505;&#1468;&#1492;, the front of God's throne, which is turned towards the earth, so that it is hidden by storm-clouds as by a &#1505;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;, <a href="/job/36-29.htm">Job 36:29</a>; <a href="/psalms/18-12.htm">Psalm 18:12</a>.

Piel (Pil.). Although &#1512;&#1506;&#1504;&#1503; and &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1504;&#1503;, <a href="/job/15-32.htm">Job 15:32</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/3-18.htm">Job 3:18</a>, have given up the i of the Pil., it has been under the influence of the following guttural; and although, moreover, i before Resh sometimes passes into a, e.g., &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;, it is more reliable to regard &#1508;&#1512;&#1513;&#1494; as inf. absol. (Ew. 141, c): expandendo. Ges. and others regard this &#1508;&#1512;&#1513;&#1494; as a mixed form, composed from &#1508;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; and &#1508;&#1512;&#1494;; but the verb &#1508;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; (with Shin) has not the signification to expand, which is assumed in connection with this derivation; it signifies to separate (also <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-12.htm">Ezekiel 34:12</a>, vid., Hitzig on that passage), whereas &#1508;&#1512;&#1513;&#1474; certainly signifies to expand (<a href="//biblehub.com/job/36-29.htm">Job 36:29-30</a>); wherefore the reading &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1474;&#1494; (with Sin), which some Codd. give, is preferred by Br, and in agreement with him by Luzzatto (vid., Br's Leket zebi, p. 244), and it seems to underlie the interpretation where &#1508;&#1512;&#1513;&#1494; &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; is translated by &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; (&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1474;) &#1508;&#1512;&#1513;, He spreadeth over it (e.g., by Aben-Ezra, Kimchi, Ralbag).

God has marked out (&#1495;&#1503;, lxx &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;) a law, i.e., here according to the sense: a fixed bound (comp. <a href="/proverbs/8-29.htm">Proverbs 8:29</a> with <a href="/psalms/104-9.htm">Psalm 104:9</a>), over the surface of the waters (i.e., describing a circle over them which defines their circuit) unto the extreme point of light by darkness, i.e., where the light is touched by the darkness. Most expositors (Rosenm., Hirz., Hahn, Schlottm., and others) take &#1506;&#1491;&#1470;&#1514;&#1499;&#1500;&#1497;&#1514; adverbially: most accurately, and refer &#1495;&#1490; to &#1488;&#1493;&#1512; as a second object, which is contrary to the usage of the language, and doubtful and unnecessary. Pareau has correctly interpreted: ad lucis usque tenebrarumque confinia; &#1506;&#1501; in the local sense, not aeque ac, although it might also have this meaning, as e.g., <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-16.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:16</a>. The idea is, that God has appointed a fixed limit to the waters, as far as to the point at which they wash the terra firma of the extreme horizon, and where the boundary line of the realms of light and darkness is; and the basis of the expression, as Bouillier, by reference to Virgil's Georg. i. 240f., has shown, is the conception of the ancients, that the earth is surrounded by the ocean, on the other side of which the region of darkness begins. </body></html>
