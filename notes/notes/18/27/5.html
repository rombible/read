Not but that he counted them righteous and good men God-ward; he did not take upon him to judge their state, and to justify or condemn them with respect to their everlasting condition; but he could not justify them in their censures of him, and say they did a right thing in charging him with wickedness and hypocrisy; nor could he justify them in all their sentiments and doctrines which they had delivered concerning the punishment of the wicked in this life, and the happiness that attends all good men; and that a man by his outward circumstances may be known to be either a good man or a bad man; such things as these he could not say were right; for so to do would be to call evil good, and good evil; and therefore he expresses his utmost abhorrence and detestation of showing his approbation of such conduct as theirs towards him, and of such unbecoming sentiments of God, and of his dealings, they had entertained; and to join in with which would be a profanation and a pollution, as the word used by him signifies; he could not do it without defiling his conscience, and profaning truth: <p>until I die one will not remove my integrity from me; Job was an upright man both in heart and life, through the grace of God bestowed on him; and he continued in his integrity, notwithstanding the temptations of Satan, and his attacks upon him, and the solicitations of his wife; and he determined through the grace of God to persist therein to the end of his life; though what he chiefly means here is, that he would not part with his character as an upright man, which he had always had, and God himself had bore testimony to; he would never give up this till he gave up the ghost; he would never suffer his integrity to be removed from him, nor remove it from himself by denying that it belonged to him, which his friends bore hard upon him to do. So Jarchi paraphrases it, <p>"I will not confess (or agree) to your saying, that I am not upright;'' <p>the phrase, "till I die", seems rather to belong to the first clause, though it is true of both, and may be repeated in this. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/27.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">God forbid that I should <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> justify you: till I die I will not remove mine <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> integrity from me.</span><p>(c) Which condemns me as a wicked man, because the hand of God is on me.<p>(d) I will not confess that God does thus punish me for my sins.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/job/27.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5</span>. <span class="ital">should justify you</span>] i. e. concede that you are in the right, viz. in charging me with evil.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">remove my integrity</span>] i. e. give up my blamelessness—refrain from asserting my innocence.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span>- <span class="cmt_word">God forbid that I should justify you</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> allow that you have been right all along, and that I have drawn these judgments down upon me by secret sins. <span class="cmt_word">Till I die I will <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/26.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>11  The pillars of heaven tremble<p>And are astonished at His threatening.<p>12  By His power He rouseth up the sea,<p>And by His understanding He breaketh Rahab in pieces.<p>13  By His breath the heavens become cheerful;<p>His hand hath formed the fugitive dragon.<p>The mountains towering up to the sky, which seem to support the vault of the sky, are called poetically "the pillars of heaven." &#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1508;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468; is Pulal, like &#1497;&#1495;&#1493;&#1500;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;, <a href="/job/26-5.htm">Job 26:5</a>; the signification of violent and quick motion backwards and forwards is secured to the verb &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507; by the Targ. &#1488;&#1514;&#1512;&#1493;&#1508;&#1507;  equals  &#1492;&#1514;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1509;, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/9-6.htm">Job 9:6</a>, and the Talm. &#1512;&#1508;&#1512;&#1507; of churned milk, blinding eyes (comp. &#1492;&#1512;&#1507; &#1506;&#1497;&#1503;, the twinkling of the eye, and Arab. rff, fut. i. o. nictare), flapping wings (comp. Arab. rff and rfrf, movere, motitare alas), of wavering thinking. &#1490;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;&#1492; is the divine command which looses or binds the powers of nature; the astonishment of the supports of heaven is, according to the radical signification of &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492;&#1468; (cogn. &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1501;), to be conceived of as a torpidity which follows the divine impulse, without offering any resistance whatever. That &#1512;&#1490;&#1506;, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/26-12.htm">Job 26:12</a>, is to be understood transitively, not like <a href="//biblehub.com/job/7-5.htm">Job 7:5</a>, intransitively, is proved by the dependent (borrowed) passages, <a href="/isaiah/51-15.htm">Isaiah 51:15</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-35.htm">Jeremiah 31:35</a>, from which it is also evident that &#1512;&#1490;&#1506; cannot with the lxx be translated &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;. The verb combines in itself the opposite significations of starting up, i.e., entering into an excited state, and of being startled, from which the significations of stilling (Niph., Hiph.), and of standing back or retreat (Arab. rj&#8219;), branch off. The conjecture &#1490;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512; after the Syriac version (which translates, go&#8219;ar bejamo) is superfluous. &#1512;&#1492;&#1489;, which here also is translated by the lxx &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, has been discussed already on <a href="/job/9-13.htm">Job 9:13</a>. It is not meant of the turbulence of the sea, to which &#1502;&#1495;&#1509; is not appropriate, but of a sea monster, which, like the crocodile and the dragon, are become an emblem of Pharaoh and his power, as <a href="/isaiah/51-9.htm">Isaiah 51:9</a>. has applied this primary passage: the writer of the book of Job purposely abstains from such references to the history of Israel. Without doubt, &#1512;&#1492;&#1489; denotes a demoniacal monster, like the demons that shall be destroyed at the end of the world, one of which is called by the Persians akomano, evil thought, another taromaiti, pride. This view is supported by <a href="//biblehub.com/job/26-13.htm">Job 26:13</a>, where one is not at liberty to determine the meaning by <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/51-9.htm">Isaiah 51:9</a>, and to understand &#1504;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473; &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1495;, like &#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503; in that passage, of Egypt. But this dependent passage is an important indication for the correct rendering of &#1495;&#1500;&#1500;&#1492;. One thing is certain at the outset, that &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1512;&#1492; is not perf. Piel  equals  &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1512;&#1492;, and for this reason, that the Dagesh which characterizes Piel cannot be omitted from any of the six mutae; the translation of Jerome, spiritus ejus ornavit coelos, and all similar ones, are therefore false. But it is possible to translate: "by His spirit (creative spirit) the heavens are beauty, His hand has formed the flying dragon." Thus, in the signification to bring forth (as <a href="/proverbs/25-23.htm">Proverbs 25:23</a>; <a href="/proverbs/8-24.htm">Proverbs 8:24</a>.), &#1495;&#1500;&#1500;&#1492; is rendered by Rosenm., Arnh., Vaih., Welte, Renan, and others, of whom Vaih. and Renan, however, do not understand <a href="/job/26-13.htm">Job 26:13</a> of the creation of the heavens, but of their illumination. By this rendering <a href="/job/26-13.htm">Job 26:13</a> and <a href="/job/26-13.htm">Job 26:13</a> are severed, as being without connection; in general, however, the course of thought in the description does not favour the reference of the whole of half of <a href="/job/26-13.htm">Job 26:13</a> to the creation. Accordingly, &#1495;&#1500;&#1500;&#1492; is not to be taken as Pilel from &#1495;&#1493;&#1500; (&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;), but after <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/57-9.htm">Isaiah 57:9</a>, as Poel from &#1495;&#1500;&#1500;, according to which the idea of <a href="/job/26-13.htm">Job 26:13</a> is determined, since both lines of the verse are most closely connected.<p>(&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1495;) &#1504;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473; &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1495; is, to wit, the constellation of the Dragon, <p>(Note: Ralbag, without any ground for it, understands it of the milky way (&#1492;&#1506;&#1490;&#1493;&#1500; &#1492;&#1495;&#1500;&#1489;&#1497;), which, according to Rapoport, Pref. to Slonimski's Toledoth ha-schamajim (1838), was already known to the Talmud b. Berachoth, 58 b, under the name of &#1504;&#1492;&#1512; &#1491;&#1504;&#1493;&#1491;.)<p>one of the most straggling constellations, which winds itself between the Greater and Lesser Bears almost half through the polar circle.<p>"Maximus hic plexu sinuoso elabitur Anguis<p>Circum perque duas in morem fluminis Arctos."<p>(Virgil, Georg. i.244f.)<p>continued...</body></html>
