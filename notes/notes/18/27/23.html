Job undertook to set this matter in a true light. Death to a godly man, is like a fair gale of wind to convey him to the heavenly country; but, to a wicked man, it is like a storm, that hurries him away to destruction. While he lived, he had the benefit of sparing mercy; but now the day of God's patience is over, and he will pour out upon him his wrath. When God casts down a man, there is no flying from, nor bearing up under his anger. Those who will not now flee to the arms of Divine grace, which are stretched out to receive them, will not be able to flee from the arms of Divine wrath, which will shortly be stretched out to destroy them. And what is a man profited if he gain the whole world, and thus lose his own soul?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Men shall clap their hands at him - That is, they shall combine to drive him out of the world, and rejoice when he is gone. The same sentiment was also expressed by Bildad, <a href="/job/18-18.htm">Job 18:18</a> :<p>"He shall be driven fromm light into darkness,<p>And chased out of the world."<p>There can be no doubt, I think, that Job alludes to that sentiment, and that his object in quoting it is to show its incorrectness. He does not indeed go into a formal reply to it in the following chapters, but he seems to consider that he had already replied to it by the statements which he had made, and which showed the incorrectness of the views which his friends had taken. He had demonstrated in the previous chapters that their main position was incorrect, and he asks (in <a href="/job/27-12.htm">Job 27:12</a> of this chapter), how it was possible that they could hold such sentiments as these, in the midst of all the facts which surrounded them? The whole current of events was against their opinion, and in the close of this chapter he enumerates the sentiments which they had advanced, which he regarded as so strange, and which he felt that he had now shown to be erroneous. In deed, they seem to have regarded themselves as confuted, for they were silent. Job had attacked and overthrown their main position, that people were treated according to their character in this life, and that consequently extraordinary sufferings were proof of extraordinary guilt, and, that being overthrown, they had nothing more to say. Having silenced them, and shown the error of the opinions which he has here enumerated, be proceeds in the following chapters to state his own views on important topics connected with the providence of God, mainly designed to show that we are not to expect fully to comprehend the reason of his dispensations. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/27.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>23. clap &#8230; hands&#8212;for joy at his downfall (La 2:15; Na 3:19).<p>hiss&#8212;deride (Jer 25:9).

The sword, famine, and pestilence are the three punishing powers by which the evil-doer's posterity, however numerous it may be, is blotted out; these three, &#1495;&#1512;&#1489;, &#1512;&#1506;&#1489;, and &#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, appear also side by side in <a href="/jeremiah/15-2.htm">Jeremiah 15:2</a>; &#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, instead of &#1502;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;, diris mortibus, is (as also <a href="/jeremiah/18-21.htm">Jeremiah 18:21</a>) equivalent to &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; in the same trio, <a href="/jeremiah/14-12.htm">Jeremiah 14:12</a>; the plague is personified (as when it is called by an Arabian poet umm el-farit, the mother of death), and Vavassor correctly observes: Mors illos sua sepeliet, nihil praeterea honoris supremi consecuturos. Bttcher (de inferis, 72) asserts that &#1489;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; can only signify pestilentiae tempore, or better, ipso mortis momento; but since &#1489;&#1468; occurs by the passive elsewhere in the sense of ab or per, e.g., <a href="/numbers/36-2.htm">Numbers 36:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/14-4.htm">Hosea 14:4</a>, it can also by &#1504;&#1511;&#1489;&#1512; denote the efficient cause.

The treasure in gold which his avarice has heaped up, and in garments which his love of display has gathered together, come into the possession of the righteous and the innocent, who are spared when these three powers of judgment sweep away the evil-doer and his family. Dust and dirt (i.e., of the streets, &#1495;&#1493;&#1510;&#1493;&#1514;) are, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/9-3.htm">Zechariah 9:3</a>, the emblem of a great abundance that depreciates even that which is valuable.
