Job now says that he fully accords with that belief. He was not disposed to defend hypocrisy; he had no sympathy for it. He knew, as they did, that all the joy of a hypocrite would be temporary, and that when death came it must vanish. He wishes that his remarks should not be construed so as to make him the advocate of hypocrisy or sin, and affirms that he relied on a more solid foundation of peace and joy than the hypocrite could possess. It was by explanations and admissions such as these that the controversy was gradually closed, and when they came fully to understand Job, they felt that they had nothing which they could reply to him.<p>Though he hath gained -  - &#1497;&#1489;&#1510;&#1506;  y&#305;&#770;ba&#770;tsa&#8219;. The Vulgate renders this, si avare rapiat - "if he avariciously seizes upon." The Septuagint, &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;  hoti &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;  epechei that he persisteth. Dr. Good, "That he should prosper;" and so Wemyss. The Hebrew word (&#1489;&#1510;&#1506;  ba&#770;tsa&#8219;) means properly, to cut or dash in pieces; then to tear in pieces, or to plunder or spoil; then to cut off, to bring to an end, etc. It is applied to the action of a weaver, who, when his web is finished, cuts off the thrum that binds it to the beam. The web is then finished; it is all woven, and is then taken from the loom. Hence, it is elegantly used to denote the close of life, when life is woven or finished - by the rapid passing of days like the weavers shuttle <a href="//biblehub.com/job/7-6.htm">Job 7:6</a>, and when it is then, as it were, taken out of the loom; see this figure explained in the notes at <a href="/isaiah/38-12.htm">Isaiah 38:12</a>. This is the idea here, that life would be cut off like the weaver's web, and that when that was done the hope of the hypocrite would be of no value.<p>When God taketh away his soul - When he dies. There has been much perplexity felt in regard to the Hebrew word here rendered "taketh away" - &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;  ye&#772;shel. A full explanation may be seen in Schultens and Rosenmuller. Some suppose it is the future from &#1504;&#1513;&#1500; for &#1497;&#1513;&#1500; - meaning to draw out, and that the idea is, that God draws out this life as a sword is drawn out of a sheath. Others, that it is from &#1513;&#1500;&#1492; - to be secure, or tranquil, or at rest: and that it refers to the time when God shall give rest in the grave, or that the meaning of the word &#1513;&#1500;&#1492; here is the same as &#1513;&#1500;&#1500; or &#1504;&#1513;&#1500; - to draw out; see Gesenius on the word &#1513;&#1500;&#1492;. Schnurrer conjectures that it is derived from &#1513;&#1488;&#1500; - to ask, to demand, and that the form here is contracted from the future &#1497;&#1513;&#1488;&#1500;. But the common supposition is, that it means to draw out - in allusion to drawing out a sword from a scabbard - thus drawing life or the soul from the body. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/27.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. "What hope hath the hypocrite, notwithstanding all his gains, when?" &c. "Gained" is antithetic to "taketh away." Umbreit's translation is an unmeaning tautology. "When God cuts off, when He taketh away his life."<p>taketh away&#8212;literally, "draws out" the soul from the body, which is, as it were, its scabbard (Job 4:21; Ps 104:29; Da 7:15). Job says that he admits what Bildad said (Job 8:13) and Zophar (Job 20:5). But he says the very fact of his still calling upon God (Job 27:10) amid all his trials, which a hypocrite would not dare to do, shows he is no "hypocrite."<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/job/27.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> There is no reason why I should envy or desire the portion of wicked men; for though they ofttimes prosper in the world, as I have said, and seem to be great gainers, yet death, which hasteneth to all men, and to me especially, will show that they are far greater losers, and die in a most wretched and desperate condition; having no hope either of continuing in this life, which they chiefly desire, or of enjoying a better life, which they never regarded.

In religion, who seems to be what he is not, a holy and righteous man; professes to have what he has not, the grace of God; pretends to do what he does not, worship God sincerely and fervently, and does all he does to be seen of men; though such a man may have an hope, as he has, of an interest in the divine layout, and of eternal glory and happiness, what will it signify? what avail will it be unto him? what will it issue in? Job was of the same mind in this with Bildad and Zophar, that such a man's hope is as the spider's web, and as the giving up of the ghost, <a href="/job/8-14.htm">Job 8:14</a>; however he may please himself with it in this life, it will be of no service to him at death; for it is not like that of the true believer's, that is sure and steadfast, and founded upon the perfect righteousness and sacrifice of Christ; but upon his outward substance, fancying, that because God prospers him in this world, he is highly in his favour, and shall enjoy the happiness of the world to come; and upon his external profession of religion, and found of duties performed by him, but he will find himself mistaken: though he hath gained; great wealth and riches under a guise of religion, and by that means making gain of godliness, and taking the one for the other; so the Targum, <p>"because he hath gathered the mammon of falsehood;'' <p>and also has great gifts, and a great deal of head knowledge, being able to talk of and dispute about most points of religion, and so has gained a great name among men both for knowledge and holiness, and yet all will not stand him in any stead, or be of any advantage to him: <p>when God taketh away his soul? out of his body by death, as a sword is drawn out of its scabbard, and which is as easily done by him; or as a shoe is plucked off from the foot, as Aben Ezra, and what he has a right to do, and will do it: and this taking it away seems to be in a violent manner, though not by what is called a violent death, yet against the will of the person; a good man is willing to die, is desirous of it, and gives up the ghost cheerfully; but an hypocrite is not willing to die, being afraid of death, and therefore his life or soul is taken from him without his consent and will, and not in love but in wrath, as the latter part of this chapter shows. Now Job had an hope which bore him up under all his troubles, and which he retained in the most killing and distressed circumstances, and which continued with him, and supported him in the views of death and eternity, so that he could look upon death, and into another world, with pleasure, and therefore could be no hypocrite, see <a href="/job/13-15.htm">Job 13:15</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/27.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For what <i>is</i> the <span class="cverse3">{f}</span> hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained, when God taketh away his soul?</span><p>(f) What advantage has the dissembler to gain, seeing he will lose his own soul?</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/job/27.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">8</span>.

The question reminds us of those words of our blessed <span class="accented">Lord</span> "What shall it profit a man, if he gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?"
