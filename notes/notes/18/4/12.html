In those early ages of the world, before God had vouchsafed to mankind a written revelation, it was usual with him to communicate the knowledge of his will to those that were pious, and earnestly desired it, by dreams and visions. <span class="ital">A thing — </span>Hebrew, <span class="ital">a word, oracle, </span>or <span class="ital">message </span>from God; <span class="ital">was secretly brought to me — </span>The Hebrew expression <span class="greekheb">יגנב</span>, <span class="ital">jegunnab, </span>is very elegant, namely, <span class="ital">stole in upon me; </span>or, <span class="ital">was brought by stealth unto me; </span>that is, privately and secretly, as the word of God used to come to the prophets, being spoken to their ear with a low and still voice, or signified to their minds in a mild and gentle manner.

He certainly would take care not to lose a syllable of what the spirit said, but he intends by the expression, that he did not fully comprehend the deep meaning of the words which he heard. Or he may be considered as expressing himself thus through modesty and humility, from a deep sense of his own weakness, and the small measure which he judged he possessed of the knowledge of divine things. As if he had said, Many, I doubt not, have a much more familiar acquaintance with God, and more full revelations from him, than I can pretend to; but a little of that treasure he hath been pleased to impart to me.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/job/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:12-21 Eliphaz relates a vision. When we are communing with our own hearts, and are still, Ps 4:4, then is a time for the Holy Spirit to commune with us. This vision put him into very great fear. Ever since man sinned, it has been terrible to him to receive communications from Heaven, conscious that he can expect no good tidings thence. Sinful man! shall he pretend to be more just, more pure, than God, who being his Maker, is his Lord and Owner? How dreadful, then, the pride and presumption of man! How great the patience of God! Look upon man in his life. The very foundation of that cottage of clay in which man dwells, is in the dust, and it will sink with its own weight. We stand but upon the dust. Some have a higher heap of dust to stand upon than others but still it is the earth that stays us up, and will shortly swallow us up. Man is soon crushed; or if some lingering distemper, which consumes like a moth, be sent to destroy him, he cannot resist it. Shall such a creature pretend to blame the appointments of God? Look upon man in his death. Life is short, and in a little time men are cut off. Beauty, strength, learning, not only cannot secure them from death, but these things die with them; nor shall their pomp, their wealth, or power, continue after them. Shall a weak, sinful, dying creature, pretend to be more just than God, and more pure than his Maker? No: instead of quarrelling with his afflictions, let him wonder that he is out of hell. Can a man be cleansed without his Maker? Will God justify sinful mortals, and clear them from guilt? or will he do so without their having an interest in the righteousness and gracious help of their promised Redeemer, when angels, once ministering spirits before his throne, receive the just recompence of their sins? Notwithstanding the seeming impunity of men for a short time, though living without God in the world, their doom is as certain as that of the fallen angels, and is continually overtaking them. Yet careless sinners note it so little, that they expect not the change, nor are wise to consider their latter end.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Now a thing - To confirm his views, Eliphaz appeals to a vision of a most remarkable character which he says he had had on some former occasion on the very point under consideration. The object of the vision was, to show that mortal man could not be more just than God, and that such was the purity of the Most High, that he put no confidence comparatively even in the angels. The design for which this is introduced here is, evidently, to reprove what he deemed the unfounded self-confidence of Job. He supposed that he had been placing an undue reliance on his own integrity; that he had not a just view of the infinite holiness of God, and had not been aware of the true state of his own heart. The highest earthly excellency, is the meaning of Eliphaz, fades away before God, and furnishes no ground for self-reliance. It is so imperfect, so feeble, so far from what it should be, that it is no wonder that a God so holy and exalted should disregard it: He designed also, by describing this vision, to reprove Job for seeming to be more wise than his Maker in arraigning him for his dealings, and uttering the language of complaint. The word "thing" here means a word (Hebrew), a communication, a revelation.<p>Was secretly brought to me - Margin, "by stealth." The Hebrew word (&#1490;&#1504;&#1489;  ga&#770;nab) means "to steal," to take away by stealth, or secretly. Here it means, that the oracle was brought to him as it were by stealth. It did not come openly and plainly, but in secrecy and silence - as a thief approaches a dwelling. An expression similar to this occurs in Lucian, in Amor. p. 884, as quoted by Schultens, &#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7; &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769; &#x3c8;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;  kleptomene&#772; lalia kai psithurismos.<p>And mine ear received a little thereof - Dr. Good translates this, "And mine ear received a whisper along with it." Noyes, "And mine ear caught a whisper thereof." The Vulgate, "And my ear received secretly the pulsations of its whisper" - venas susurri ejus. The word rendered "a little," &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1509;  shemets, occurs only here and in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/26-14.htm">Job 26:14</a>, where it is also rendered little. It means, according to Gesenius, a transient sound rapidly uttered and swiftly passing away. Symm. &#x3c8;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;  psithurismos - a whisper. According to Castell, it means a sound confused and feeble, such as one receives when a man is speaking in a hurried manner, and when he cannot catch all that is said. This is probably the sense here. Eliphaz means to say that he did not get all that might have been said in the vision. It occurred in such circumstances, and what was said was delivered in such a manner, that he did not hear it all distinctly.<p>But he beard an important sentiment, which he proceeds to apply to the case of Job. - It has been made a question whether Eliphaz really had such a vision, or whether he only supposed such a case, and whether the whole representation is not poetic. The fair construction is, that he had had such a vision. In such a supposition there is nothing inconsistent with the mode in which the will of God was made known in ancient times; and in the sentiments uttered there is nothing inconsistent with what might have been spoken by a celestial visitant on such an occasion. All that was spoken was in accordance with the truth everywhere revealed in the Scriptures, though Eliphaz perverted it to prove that Job was insincere and hypocritical. The general sentiment in the oracle was, that man was not pure and holy compared with his Maker; that no one was free from guilt in his sight; that there was no virtue in man in which God could put entire confidence; and that, therefore, all were subjected to trials and to death. But this general sentiment he proceeds to apply to Job, and regards it as teaching, that since he was overwhelmed with such special afflictions, there must have been some secret sin of which he was guilty, which was the cause of his calamities. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. a thing&#8212;Hebrew, a "word." Eliphaz confirms his view by a divine declaration which was secretly and unexpectedly imparted to him.<p>a little&#8212;literally, "a whisper"; implying the still silence around, and that more was conveyed than articulate words could utter (Job 26:14; 2Co 12:4).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/job/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Now, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">and</span>, or <span class="ital">moreover</span>, I will further convince thee by a vision which I had relating to such matters as these. That here follows a relation of a vision is apparent from the punctual description of all its circumstances. To think as some do, that this was but a fiction and artifice which Eliphaz used, that his words might have more authority with Job, or that this was a diabolical delusion, seems to be both uncharitable and unreasonable, partly because Eliphaz, though under a mistake concerning Job’s case, was doubtless a wise and good man, and therefore would not needlessly make himself a liar for Job’s conviction; and partly from the matter of this vision, which is no way suitable to the nature or designs of the devil, but holy and agreeable to the Divine majesty and purity, and useful for men’s instruction, and humiliation, and reformation. It was therefore a Divine vision, which in that age and state of the church, before the Holy Scriptures were written, was the usual way of God’s discovery of his mind to those that sought to him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">A thing, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">a word</span>, to wit, from God, as <span class="bld"><a href="/proverbs/13-13.htm" title="Whoever despises the word shall be destroyed: but he that fears the commandment shall be rewarded.">Proverbs 13:13</a></span>, a doctrine or message. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Was secretly brought to me, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">was stolen, or brought by stealth into me</span>, i.e. privately and secretly, as the word of God used to come to the prophets, being spoken in their ear, as it was to Samuel, <span class="bld"><a href="/1_samuel/9-15.htm" title="Now the LORD had told Samuel in his ear a day before Saul came, saying,">1 Samuel 9:15</a></span>; and the like to Moses, so as Pharaoh, though present, could not hear nor observe it, <span class="bld"><a href="/exodus/11-1.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Yet will I bring one plague more on Pharaoh, and on Egypt; afterwards he will let you go hence: when he shall let you go, he shall surely thrust you out hence altogether.">Exodus 11:1</a></span>, with a low and still voice, a secret whisper.

And withal, this may be a modest and humble expression, arising from a deep sense of his own infirmity, and the small measure of his knowledge of Divine things, whereof he knew only some little fragments and parcels, as Paul said, <span class="ital">We know but in part</span>, <span class="bld"><a href="/1_corinthians/13-9.htm" title="For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.">1 Corinthians 13:9</a></span>.

From reason and experience, Eliphaz proceeds to a vision and revelation he had from God, showing the purity and holiness of God, and the frailty, weakness, folly, and sinfulness of men, by which it appears that men cannot be just in the sight of God, and therefore it must be wrong in Job to insist upon his innocence and integrity. Some indeed have thought that this was a mere fiction of Eliphaz, and not a real vision; yea, some have gone so far as to pronounce it a diabolical one, but without any just foundation; for there is nothing in the manner or matter of it but what is agreeable to a divine vision or to a revelation from God; besides, though Eliphaz was a mistaken man in the case of Job, yet was a good man, as may be concluded from the acceptance of a sacrifice for him by the Lord, which was offered for him by Job, according to the order of God, and therefore could never be guilty of such an imposture; nor does Job ever charge him with any falsehood in this matter, who doubtless would have been able to have traversed and exposed him; add to all this, that in his discourse annexed to and continued along with this account, stands a passage, which the apostle has quoted as of divine inspiration, <a href="/1_corinthians/3-19.htm">1 Corinthians 3:19</a>; from <a href="/job/5-13.htm">Job 5:13</a>. When Eliphaz had this vision, whether within the seven days of his visit to Job, or before, some time ago, which he might call to mind on this occasion, and judging it appropiate to the present case, thought fit to relate it, is not certain, nor very material to know: it is introduced after this manner, "a thing" or "word", a word of prophecy, a word from the Lord, a revelation of his mind and will, which was hidden and secret, and what before he was not so well acquainted with; this was "brought" unto him by the Spirit of God, or by a messenger from the Lord, sent on this occasion, and for this purpose; and the manner in which it was brought was "secretly" or "by stealth", as Mr. Broughton and others (l) render it; it was "stolen" unto him, or "secretly" brought, as the Targum, and we, and others (m); it was in a private way or manner; or "suddenly", as some others (n), at unawares, when it was not expected by him: it may have respect to the still and silent manner in which it was revealed to him, "there was silence, and he heard a voice"; a still one, a secret whisper; or to the almost invisible person that revealed it, whose image he saw, but could not discern his form and likeness; or it may be to the distinguishing favour he enjoyed, in having this revelation particularly made to him, and not to others; he heard this word, as it were, behind the curtain, or vail, as the Jews (o) say, explaining this passage: <p>mine ear received a little of it; this revelation was made, not by an impulse upon his spirits, but vocally, a voice was heard, as after declared, and Eliphaz was attentive to it; he listened to what was said, and heard, and took it in with much delight and pleasure, though but a small part of it, as his capacity was able to retain it; or it was but a small part of the will of God, an hint of his only, as some interpret it (p). Schultens has shown, from the use of a word near this in the Arabic language, that it signifies "a string of pearls"; and so may design a set of evangelic truths, comparable to gold, silver, and precious stones, and which are indeed more desirable than them, and preferable to them; what they are will be observed hereafter. <p>(l) "furtive", V.

His ear caught it all, but the whole of it was but a whisper.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>12–5:7. Turning to Job’s murmurs against heaven, Eliphaz points to the unapproachable purity of God and the imperfection of all creatures, and warns Job against such complaints<span class="bld"><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></span>Having expressed his wonder that a righteous man like Job should fall into such utter despair under afflictions, forgetting that to the righteous affliction is but a discipline, Eliphaz seeks to draw Job back to consider what is the real cause of all affliction. This is the imperfection of man, an imperfection which he shares indeed with all created beings, in the highest of whom to God’s eye there is limit and possible error. And this being so, murmuring can only aggravate his affliction by provoking the anger of God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The passage falls into two divisions. In the first, <span class="ital"><a href="/context/job/4-12.htm" title="Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and my ear received a little thereof....">Job 4:12-21</a></span>, Eliphaz contrasts the holiness of God with the imperfection of all creatures, even the pure spirits on high, and much more a material being like man, and thus indirectly suggests to Job the true secret of his troubles. In the second, ch. <a href="/context/job/5-1.htm" title="Call now, if there be any that will answer you; and to which of the saints will you turn?...">Job 5:1-7</a>, having laid this broad foundation, he builds on it a warning to Job against his murmurs. Only the wicked resent God’s dealing with them, and by doing so bring increased wrath upon themselves till they perish.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>With great delicacy and consideration Eliphaz, instead of impressing the imperfection of man on Job directly, narrates how this truth was once impressed upon himself by a voice from heaven. It was in the dead of night, when all around were in deep sleep. His mind was agitated by perplexing thoughts arising out of visions of the night. Suddenly a great terror fell upon him. Then there passed before his face a breath. And there seemed to stand before him a form, too dim to discern, from which came forth a still voice, which said, Can man be righteous with God? Or, Can a man be pure with his Maker? Even to the holy angels He imputeth error, how much more to frail and earthly man? <span class="ital"><a href="/context/job/4-12.htm" title="Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and my ear received a little thereof....">Job 4:12-21</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Applying to Job this truth, so impressively taught to himself, Eliphaz asks, If Job appeals against God, whether any of the holy beings, who minister between God and men, will listen to his appeal? (ch. <a href="/job/5-1.htm" title="Call now, if there be any that will answer you; and to which of the saints will you turn?">Job 5:1</a>). Nay, it is only the wicked who resent the afflictions of God, and by their rebellious impatience increase their afflictions till they are destroyed. Such an instance he had himself seen. He saw a fool, a rebellious murmurer against Heaven, spreading forth his roots and giving promise for a moment of prosperity. But suddenly destruction came upon him. His harvest was seized by the hungry robber; the rights of his children were trampled upon; and his home was broken up and desolate (<span class="ital"><a href="/context/job/4-2.htm" title="If we assay to commune with you, will you be grieved? but who can withhold himself from speaking?...">Job 4:2-5</a></span>). And finally, Eliphaz condenses into a vivid aphorism his teaching in this section: <span class="ital">for trouble springs not out of the ground</span>—it is not accidental nor a spontaneous growth of the soil. <span class="ital">But man is born unto trouble</span>—it is his nature so to act that by his evil deeds he brings trouble upon himself. Out of his heart rises up evil as naturally as the fire sends forth sparks (<span class="ital"><a href="/context/job/4-6.htm" title="Is not this your fear, your confidence, your hope, and the uprightness of your ways?...">Job 4:6-7</a></span>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12-21.</span> - Eliphaz proceeds to narrate a spiritual experience of a very strange and striking character. It was night, and he had fallen asleep, when suddenly he was, or seemed to himself to be, awake. A horrible fear came over him, and all his limbs trembled and quaked. Then a spirit seemed to pass before his face, while every hair on his body rose up and stiffened with horror. It did not simply pass across him, but stood still, in a formless form, which he could see but not clearly distinguish. There was a deep hush. Then out of the silence there seemed to come a voice, a whisper, which articulated solemn words. "Shall mortal man be more just than God? Shall a man," etc.? Supernatural visitations were vouchsafed by God to many besides the chosen people - to Laban, when he pursued Jacob (<a href="/genesis/31-24.htm">Genesis 31:24</a>), to Abimelech (<a href="/genesis/20-6.htm">Genesis 20:6</a>), to the Pharaoh of the time of Joseph (<a href="/genesis/41-1.htm">Genesis 41:1-7</a>), to his chief butler (<a href="/genesis/40-9.htm">Genesis 40:9-11</a>), and his chief baker (<a href="/genesis/40-16.htm">Genesis 40:16, 17</a>), to Balaam the son of Beer (<a href="/numbers/22-12.htm">Numbers 22:12, 20</a>; <a href="/numbers/23-5.htm">Numbers 23:5-10, 16-24</a>; <a href="/numbers/24-3.htm">Numbers 24:3-9, 15-24</a>), to Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="/daniel/2-28.htm">Daniel 2:28-35</a>; <a href="/daniel/4-1.htm">Daniel 4:1-32</a>), and others. The method and manner of these visitations raise a multitude of questions which it is impossible to answer, but are convincing evidence to all who believe Scripture to be true, that communications can pass between the spiritual and material worlds of a strange and mysterious character. The communication to Eliphaz may have been a mere vision, impressed upon his mind in sleep, or it may have been actually brought to him by a spiritual messenger, whom he could dimly see, and whose voice he was privileged to hear. Modern pseudo-science pronounces such seeing and hearing to be impossible. But poets are often clearer-sighted than scientists, and Shakespeare utters a pregnant truth when he says - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,<br />Than are dreamt of in your philosophy."</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now a thing was secretly brought to me</span>; rather, <span class="accented">a word</span> (or, <span class="accented">a message</span>) <span class="accented">was brought to me stealthily. <span class="cmt_word"></span>And mine ear received a little thereof</span>; rather, a <span class="accented">whisper</span> thereof (see the Revised Version, and comp. <a href="/job/26-14.htm">Job 26:14</a>, and the Vulgate, which gives <span class="accented">susurrus</span>). As the form of the vision was not distinct to Eliphaz's eyes (ver. 16), so neither were the words which were uttered distinct to his ears. He thinks himself able, however, to give the sense of them (see vers. 17-21). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>  6  Is not thy piety thy confidence,<p>Thy Hope?
