When we are communing with our own hearts, and are still, Ps 4:4, then is a time for the Holy Spirit to commune with us. This vision put him into very great fear. Ever since man sinned, it has been terrible to him to receive communications from Heaven, conscious that he can expect no good tidings thence. Sinful man! shall he pretend to be more just, more pure, than God, who being his Maker, is his Lord and Owner? How dreadful, then, the pride and presumption of man! How great the patience of God! Look upon man in his life. The very foundation of that cottage of clay in which man dwells, is in the dust, and it will sink with its own weight. We stand but upon the dust. Some have a higher heap of dust to stand upon than others but still it is the earth that stays us up, and will shortly swallow us up. Man is soon crushed; or if some lingering distemper, which consumes like a moth, be sent to destroy him, he cannot resist it. Shall such a creature pretend to blame the appointments of God? Look upon man in his death. Life is short, and in a little time men are cut off. Beauty, strength, learning, not only cannot secure them from death, but these things die with them; nor shall their pomp, their wealth, or power, continue after them. Shall a weak, sinful, dying creature, pretend to be more just than God, and more pure than his Maker? No: instead of quarrelling with his afflictions, let him wonder that he is out of hell. Can a man be cleansed without his Maker? Will God justify sinful mortals, and clear them from guilt? or will he do so without their having an interest in the righteousness and gracious help of their promised Redeemer, when angels, once ministering spirits before his throne, receive the just recompence of their sins? Notwithstanding the seeming impunity of men for a short time, though living without God in the world, their doom is as certain as that of the fallen angels, and is continually overtaking them. Yet careless sinners note it so little, that they expect not the change, nor are wise to consider their latter end.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In thoughts - Amidst the tumultuous and anxious thoughts which occur in the night. The Hebrew word rendered thoughts, (&#1513;&#1474;&#1506;&#1508;&#1497;&#1501;  s&#769;a&#770;&#8219;&#305;&#770;ph&#305;&#770;ym), means thoughts which divide and distract the mind.<p>From the visions of the night - On the meaning of the word visions, see the notes at <a href="/isaiah/1-1.htm">Isaiah 1:1</a>. This was a common mode in which the will of God was made known in ancient times. For an extended description of this method of communicating the will of God, the reader may consult my Introduction to Isaiah, Section 7.<p>When deep sleep falleth on men - The word here rendered deep sleep, &#1514;&#1512;&#1491;&#1502;&#1492;  tarde&#770;ma&#770;h, commonly denotes a profound repose or slumber brought upon man by divine agency. So Schultens in loc. It is the word used to describe the "deep sleep" which God brought upon Adam when he took from his side a rib to form Eve, <a href="/genesis/2-21.htm">Genesis 2:21</a>; and that, also, which came upon Abraham, when an horror of great darkness fell upon him; <a href="/genesis/15-12.htm">Genesis 15:12</a>. It means here profound repose, and the vision which he saw was at that solemn hour when the world is usually locked in slumber. Umbreit renders this, "In the time of thoughts, before the night-visions," and supposes that Eliphaz refers to the time that was especially favorable to meditation and to serious contemplation before the time of sleep and of dreams. In support of this use of the preposition &#1502;&#1503;  m&#305;&#770;n, he appeals to <a href="//biblehub.com/haggai/2-16.htm">Haggai 2:16</a>, and Noldius Concord. Part. p. 546.<p>Our common version, however, has probably preserved the true sense of the passage. It is impossible to conceive anything more sublime than this whole description. It was midnight. There was solitude and silence all around. At that fearful hour this vision came, and a sentiment was communicated to Eliphaz of the utmost importance, and fitted to make the deepest possible impression. The time; the quiet; the form of the image; its passing along, and then suddenly standing still; the silence, and then the deep and solemn voice - all were fitted to produce the proroundest awe. So graphic and so powerful is this description, that it would be impossible to read it - and particularly at midnight and alone - without something of the feeling of awe and horror which Eliphaz says it produced on his mind. It is a description which for power has probably never been equalled, though an attempt to describe an apparition from the invisible world has been often made. Virgil has attempted such a description, which, though exceedingly beautiful, is far inferior to this of the Sage of Teman. It is the description of the appearance of the wife of Aeneas:<p>Infelix simulacrum atque ipsius umbra Crousae<p>Visa mihi ante oculos, et nora major imago.<p>Obstupui, steteruntque comae, et vox faucibus haesit.<p>Aeneid ii.772.<p> - "At length she hears,<p>And sudden through the shades of night appears;<p>Appears no more Creusa, nor my wife,<p>But a pale spectre, larger than the life.<p>Aghast, astonished, and struck dumb with fear,<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13.
