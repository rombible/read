When we are communing with our own hearts, and are still, Ps 4:4, then is a time for the Holy Spirit to commune with us. This vision put him into very great fear. Ever since man sinned, it has been terrible to him to receive communications from Heaven, conscious that he can expect no good tidings thence. Sinful man! shall he pretend to be more just, more pure, than God, who being his Maker, is his Lord and Owner? How dreadful, then, the pride and presumption of man! How great the patience of God! Look upon man in his life. The very foundation of that cottage of clay in which man dwells, is in the dust, and it will sink with its own weight. We stand but upon the dust. Some have a higher heap of dust to stand upon than others but still it is the earth that stays us up, and will shortly swallow us up. Man is soon crushed; or if some lingering distemper, which consumes like a moth, be sent to destroy him, he cannot resist it. Shall such a creature pretend to blame the appointments of God? Look upon man in his death. Life is short, and in a little time men are cut off. Beauty, strength, learning, not only cannot secure them from death, but these things die with them; nor shall their pomp, their wealth, or power, continue after them. Shall a weak, sinful, dying creature, pretend to be more just than God, and more pure than his Maker? No: instead of quarrelling with his afflictions, let him wonder that he is out of hell. Can a man be cleansed without his Maker? Will God justify sinful mortals, and clear them from guilt? or will he do so without their having an interest in the righteousness and gracious help of their promised Redeemer, when angels, once ministering spirits before his throne, receive the just recompence of their sins? Notwithstanding the seeming impunity of men for a short time, though living without God in the world, their doom is as certain as that of the fallen angels, and is continually overtaking them. Yet careless sinners note it so little, that they expect not the change, nor are wise to consider their latter end.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>How much less - (&#1488;&#1507;  'aph). This particle has the general sense of addition, accession, especially of something more important;" yea more, besides, even." Gesenius. The meaning here is, "how much more true is this of man!" He puts no confidence in his angels; he charges them with frailty; how much more strikingly true must this be of man! It is not merely, as our common translation would seem to imply, that he put much less confidence in man than in angels; it is, that all he had said must be more strikingly true of man, who dwelt in so frail and humble a habitation.<p>In them that dwell in houses of clay - In man. The phrase "houses of clay" refers to the body made of dust. The sense is, that man, from the fact that he dwells in such a tabernacle, is far inferior to the pure spirits that surround the throne of God, and much more liable to sin. The body is represented as a temporary tent, tabernacle, or dwelling for the soul. That dwelling is soon to be taken down, and its tenant, the soul, to be removed to other abodes. So Paul <a href="/2_corinthians/5-1.htm">2 Corinthians 5:1</a> speaks of the body as &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;  he&#772; epigeios he&#772;mo&#772;n oikia tou ske&#772;nous - "our earthly house of this tabernacle." So Plato speaks of it as &#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3b9;&#836;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  ge&#772;inon ske&#772;nos - an earthly tent; and so Aristophanes (Av. 587), among other contemptuous expressions applied to people, calls them &#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; &#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;  plasmata pe&#772;lou, "vessels of clay." The idea in the verse before us is beautiful, and as affecting as it is beautiful. A house of clay (&#1495;&#1502;&#1512;  cho&#770;mer) was little fitted to bear the extremes of heat and cold, of storm and sunshine, of rain, and frost, and snow, and would soon crumble and decay. It must be a frail and temporary dwelling. It could not endure the changes of the seasons and the lapse of years like a dwelling of granite or marble. So with our bodies. They can bear little. They are frail, infirm, and feeble. They are easily prostrated, and soon fall back to their native dust. How can they who dwelt in such edifices, be in any way compared with the Infinite and Eternal God?<p>Whose foundation is in the dust - A house to be firm and secure should be founded on a rock; see <a href="/matthew/7-25.htm">Matthew 7:25</a>. The figure is kept up here of comparing man with a house; and as a house that is built on the sand or the dust may be easily washed away (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/7-26.htm">Matthew 7:26-27</a>), and could not be confided in, so it was with man. He was like such a dwelling; and no more confidence could be reposed in him than in such a house.<p>Which are crushed - They are broken in pieces, trampled on, destroyed (&#1491;&#1499;&#1488;  da&#770;ka&#770;'), by the most insignificant objects.<p>Before the moth - See <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/50-9.htm">Isaiah 50:9</a>, note; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/51-8.htm">Isaiah 51:8</a>, note. The word moth (&#1506;&#1513;&#1473;  &#8219;a&#770;sh), Greek &#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c2;  se&#772;s, Vulgate, tinea, denotes properly an insect which flies by night, and particularly that which attaches itself to woolen cloth and consumes it. It is possible, however, that the word here denotes the moth-worm. This "moth-worm is one state of the creature. which first is inclosed in an egg, and thence issues in the form of a worm; after a time, it quits the form of a worm, to assume that of the complete state of the insect, or the moth." Calmet. The comparison here, therefore, is not that of a moth flying against a house to overset it, nor of the moth consuming man as it does a garment, but it is that of a feeble worm that preys upon man and destroys him; and the idea is, that the most feeble of all objects may crush him. The following remarks from Niebuhr (Reisebeschreibung von Arabien, S. 133), will serve to illustrate this passage, and show that so feeble a thing as a worm may destroy human life. "There is in Yemen, in India, and on the coasts of the South Sea, a common sickness caused by the Guinea, or nerve-worm, known to European physicians by the name of vena Medinensis. It is supposed in Yemen that this worm is ingested from the bad water which the inhabitants of those countries are under a necessity of using. Many of the Arabians on this account take the precaution to strain the water which they drink. If anyone has by accident swallowed an egg of this worm, no trace of it is to be seen until it appears on the skin; and the first indication of it there, is the irritation which is caused. On our physician, a few days before his death, five of these worms made their appearance, although we had been more than five months absent from Arabia. On the island of Charedsch, I saw a French officer, whose name was Le Page, who after a long and arduous journey, which he had made on foot, from Pondicherry to Surat, through the heart of India, found the traces of such a worm in him, which he endeavored to extract from his body.<p>He believed that be had swallowed it when drinking the waters of Mahratta. The worm is not dangerous, if it can be drawn from the body without being broken. The Orientals are accustomed, as soon as the worm makes its appearance through the skin, to wind it up on a piece of straw, or of dry wood. It is finer than a thread, and is from two to three feet in length. The winding up of the worm frequently occupies a week; and no further inconvenience is experienced, than the care which is requisite not to break it. If, however, it is broken, it draws itself back into the body, and then becomes dangerous. Lameness, gangrene, or the loss of life itself is the result." See the notes at Isaiah referred to above. The comparison of man with a worm, or an insect, on account of his feebleness and shortness of life, is common in the sacred writings, and in the Classics. The following passage from Pindar, quoted by Schultens, hints at the same idea:<p>&#x395;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;, &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769; &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#894; &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769; &#x3b4; &#787; &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#894;<p>&#x3a3;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c1; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;.<p>Epameroi, ti de tis; ti d' ou tis;<p>Skias onar anthro&#772;poi.<p>"Things of a day! What is anyone? What is he not? Men are the dream of a shadow!" - The idea in the passage before us is, that people are exceedingly frail, and that in such creatures no confidence can be placed. How should such a creature, therefore, presume to arraign the wisdom and equity of the divine dealings? How can he be more just or wise than God? <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19. houses of clay&#8212;(2Co 5:1).

They can hardly mean in the connexion, <span class="ital">by</span> the moth; although the moth is usually elsewhere spoken of as the destroyer, ch. <a href="/job/13-28.htm" title="And he, as a rotten thing, consumes, as a garment that is moth eaten.">Job 13:28</a>; <a href="/isaiah/50-9.htm" title="Behold, the Lord GOD will help me; who is he that shall condemn me? see, they all shall wax old as a garment; the moth shall eat them up.">Isaiah 50:9</a>; <a href="/isaiah/51-8.htm" title="For the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm shall eat them like wool: but my righteousness shall be for ever, and my salvation from generation to generation.">Isaiah 51:8</a>, and not as the object of destruction. The phrase <span class="ital">before</span> might have a sense similar to what it has in ch. <a href="/job/3-24.htm" title="For my sighing comes before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters.">Job 3:24</a>, <span class="ital">like</span> the moth; so the Sept.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">How much less in them that dwell in houses of clay!</span> rather, <span class="accented">hew muck more cloth he not put trust in them that inhabit houses of clay</span>! <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "earthly bodies," bodies made out of the dust of the ground (<a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>; setup, <a href="/job/33-6.htm">Job 33:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Whose foundation is in the dust</span>; <span class="accented">i.e."</span> whose origin was the dust of the ground," which were formed from it and must return to it, according to the words of <a href="/genesis/3-19.htm">Genesis 3:19</a>, "Dust thou art, and unto dust thou must return." <span class="cmt_word">Which are crushed before the moth</span>.

Eliphaz does not say &#1488;&#1500;&#1497; &#1493;&#1497;&#1490;&#1504;&#1468;&#1489; (although he means a single occurrence), because he desires, with pathos, to put himself prominent. That the word came to him so secretly, and that he heard only as it were a whisper (&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1509;, according to Arnheim, in distinction from &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;, denotes a faint, indistinct impression on the ear), is designed to show the value of such a solemn communication, and to arouse curiosity. Instead of the prosaic &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, we find here the poetic pausal-form &#1502;&#1504;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; expanded from &#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, after the form &#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;, <a href="/job/21-16.htm">Job 21:16</a>; <a href="/psalms/18-23.htm">Psalm 18:23</a>. &#1502;&#1503; is partitive: I heard only a whisper, murmur; the word was too sacred and holy to come loudly and directly to his ear. It happened, as he lay in the deep sleep of night, in the midst of the confusion of thought resulting from nightly dreams. &#1513;&#1474;&#1506;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; (from &#1513;&#1474;&#1506;&#1497;&#1507;, branched) are thoughts proceeding like branches from the heart as their root, and intertwining themselves; the &#1502;&#1503; which follows refers to the cause: there were all manner of dreams which occasioned the thoughts, and to which they referred (comp. <a href="/job/33-15.htm">Job 33:15</a>); &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492;, in distinction from &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492;, sleep, and &#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492;, slumber, is the deep sleep related to death and ecstasy, in which man sinks back from outward life into the remotest ground of his inner life.

The subject of &#1492;&#1508;&#1495;&#1497;&#1491; is the undiscerned ghostlike something. Eliphaz was stretched upon his bed when &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;, a breath of wind, passed (&#1495;&#1500;&#1507;( dessap, similar to <a href="/isaiah/21-1.htm">Isaiah 21:1</a>) over his face. The wind is the element by means of which the spirit-existence is made manifest; comp. <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/19-12.htm">1 Kings 19:12</a>, where Jehovah appears in a gentle whispering of the wind, and <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/2-2.htm">Acts 2:2</a>, where the descent of the Holy Spirit is made known by a mighty rushing. &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;, &#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;, Sanscrit a&#770;tma, signifies both the immaterial spirit and the air, which is proportionately the most immaterial of material things.<p>(Note: On wind and spirit, vid., Windischmann, Die Philosophie im Fortgang der Weltgesch.
