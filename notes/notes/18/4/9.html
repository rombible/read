Nor can they escape, were they even as strong as lions, yea, as the strongest and fiercest of them. For when the divine wrath is once kindled against them, their power is immediately broken, and in a moment they are cut off, and totally consumed. He speaks of powerful tyrants, fitly compared to lions, <a href="/ezekiel/32-2.htm" title="Son of man, take up a lamentation for Pharaoh king of Egypt, and say to him, You are like a young lion of the nations, and you are as a whale in the seas: and you came forth with your rivers, and troubled the waters with your feet, and fouled their rivers.">Ezekiel 32:2</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/38-13.htm" title="Sheba, and Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish, with all the young lions thereof, shall say to you, Are you come to take a spoil? have you gathered your company to take a prey? to carry away silver and gold, to take away cattle and goods, to take a great spoil?">Ezekiel 38:13</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/4-17.htm" title="Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fully known, and that all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.">2 Timothy 4:17</a>, who, though for a time they persecute and oppress other men, yet in due time they are restrained and crushed by the mighty power of God.

That good men were never thus ruined. But there is one event both to the righteous and to the wicked, Ec 9:2, both in life and death; the great and certain difference is after death. Our worst mistakes are occasioned by drawing wrong views from undeniable truths. 2. That wicked men were often thus ruined: for the proof of this, Eliphaz vouches his own observation.

The figure is taken from the hot and fiery wind, which, sweeping over a field of grain, dries it up and destroys it. In like manner Eliphaz says the wicked perish before God.<p>And by the breath of his nostrils - By his anger. The Scripture often speaks of breathing out indignation and wrath; <a href="/acts/9-1.htm">Acts 9:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/27-12.htm">Psalm 27:12</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/22-16.htm">2 Samuel 22:16</a>; <a href="/psalms/18-15.htm">Psalm 18:15</a>; <a href="/psalms/33-6.htm">Psalm 33:6</a>; notes at <a href="/isaiah/11-4.htm">Isaiah 11:4</a>; notes at <a href="/isaiah/30-28.htm">Isaiah 30:28</a>; notes at <a href="/isaiah/33-11.htm">Isaiah 33:11</a>. The figure was probably taken from the violent breathing which is evinced when the mind is under any strong emotion, especially anger. It refers here to any judgment by which God cuts off the wicked, but especially to sudden calamity - like a tempest or the pestilence. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. breath of his nostrils&#8212;God's anger; a figure from the fiery winds of the East (Job 1:16; Isa 5:25; Ps 18:8, 15).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/job/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">By the blast of God, </span> to wit, <span class="ital">of his nostrils</span>, as it here follows, i.e. by his anger, which in men shows itself in the nostrils, by hot and frequent breathings there, and therefore by an anthropopathy is ascribed to God; by a secret, and oft undiscerned, but mighty and powerful, judgment of God, by which they are blasted and blown away as chaff by the wind, as the phrase is, <span class="bld">Psalm 1</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/job/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>By the blast of God they perish,....

Similar examples are <a href="/job/4-21.htm">Job 4:21</a>; <a href="/numbers/16-22.htm">Numbers 16:22</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/8-4.htm">Jeremiah 8:4</a>; and with interrogative Wherefore? <a href="/isaiah/5-4.htm">Isaiah 5:4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/50-2.htm">Isaiah 50:2</a> : comp. the similar paratactic union of sentences, <a href="/job/2-10.htm">Job 2:10</a>; <a href="/job/3-11.htm">Job 3:11</a>. The question arises here, whether &#1504;&#1505;&#1468;&#1492; is an Aramaic form of writing for &#1504;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488; (as the Masora in distinction from <a href="/deuteronomy/4-34.htm">Deuteronomy 4:34</a> takes it), and also either future, Wilt thou, if we raise, i.e., utter, etc.; or passive, as Ewald formerly, <p>(Note: In the second edition, comp. Jahrb. ix. 37, he explains it otherwise: "If we attempt a word with thee, will it be grievous to thee quod aegre feras?"

The last is to be preferred, because more admissible and also more expressive. &#1504;&#1505;&#1468;&#1492; followed by the fut. is a hypothetic praet., Supposing that, etc., wilt thou, etc., as e.g., <a href="/job/23-10.htm">Job 23:10</a>. &#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503; is the Aramaic plur. of &#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;, which is more frequent in the book of Job than the Hebrew plur. &#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;.
