When we are communing with our own hearts, and are still, Ps 4:4, then is a time for the Holy Spirit to commune with us. This vision put him into very great fear. Ever since man sinned, it has been terrible to him to receive communications from Heaven, conscious that he can expect no good tidings thence. Sinful man! shall he pretend to be more just, more pure, than God, who being his Maker, is his Lord and Owner? How dreadful, then, the pride and presumption of man! How great the patience of God! Look upon man in his life. The very foundation of that cottage of clay in which man dwells, is in the dust, and it will sink with its own weight. We stand but upon the dust. Some have a higher heap of dust to stand upon than others but still it is the earth that stays us up, and will shortly swallow us up. Man is soon crushed; or if some lingering distemper, which consumes like a moth, be sent to destroy him, he cannot resist it. Shall such a creature pretend to blame the appointments of God? Look upon man in his death. Life is short, and in a little time men are cut off. Beauty, strength, learning, not only cannot secure them from death, but these things die with them; nor shall their pomp, their wealth, or power, continue after them. Shall a weak, sinful, dying creature, pretend to be more just than God, and more pure than his Maker? No: instead of quarrelling with his afflictions, let him wonder that he is out of hell. Can a man be cleansed without his Maker? Will God justify sinful mortals, and clear them from guilt? or will he do so without their having an interest in the righteousness and gracious help of their promised Redeemer, when angels, once ministering spirits before his throne, receive the just recompence of their sins? Notwithstanding the seeming impunity of men for a short time, though living without God in the world, their doom is as certain as that of the fallen angels, and is continually overtaking them. Yet careless sinners note it so little, that they expect not the change, nor are wise to consider their latter end.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Doth not their excellency ... - Dr. Good renders this, "Their fluttering round is over with them," by a very forced construction of the passage. Translators and expositors have been very much divided in opinion as to its meaning; but the sense seems to be, that whatever is excellent in people is torn away or removed. Their excellence does not keep them from death, and they are taken off before they are truly wise. The word "excellency" here refers not only to moral excellency or virtue, but everything in which they excel others. Whatever there is in them of strength, or virtue, or influence, is removed. The word used here &#1497;&#1514;&#1512;  yether means, literally, something hanging over or redundant (from &#1497;&#1514;&#1512;  ya&#770;thar, to hang over, be redundant, or to remain), and hence, it means abundance or remainder, and then that which exceeds or abounds. It is thus applied to any distinguished virtue or excellency, as that which exceeds the ordinary limits or bounds. Men perish; and however eminent they may have been, they are soon cut off, and vanish away. The object here is to show how weak, and frail, and unworthy of confidence are people even in their most elevated condition.<p>They die, even without wisdom - That is, before they become truly wise. The object is to show, that people are so short-lived compared with angels, that they have no opportunity to become distinguished for wisdom. Their days are few; and however careful may be their observation, before they have had time to become truly wise they are hurried away. They are, therefore, wholly disqualified to sit in judgment on the doings of God, and to arraign, as Job had done, the divine wisdom.<p>Here closes the oracle which was addressed to Eliphaz. It is a description of unrivaled sublimity. In the sentiments that were addressed to Eliphaz, there is nothing that is contradictory to the other communications which God has made to people, or to what is taught by reason. Every reader of this passage must feel that the thoughts are singularly sublime, and that they are such as are adapted to make a deep impression on the mind. The error in Eliphaz consisted in the application which he makes of them to Job, and in the inference which he draws, that he must have been a hypocrite. This inference is drawn in the following chapter. As the oracle stands here, it is pertinent to the argument which Eliphaz had commenced, and just fitted to furnish a reproof to Job for the irreverent manner in which he had spoken, and the complaints which he had brought <a href="//biblehub.com/job/3.htm">Job 3</a> against the dealings of God. Let us learn from the oracle:<p>(1) That man cannot be more just than God; and let this be an abiding principle of our lives;<p>(2) Not to complain at his dispensations, but to confide in his superior wisdom and goodness;<p>(3) That our opportunities of observation, and our rank in existence, are as nothing compared with those of the angels, who are yet so inferior to God as to be charged with folly;<p>(4) That our foundation is in the dust, and that the most insignificant object may sweep us away; and<p>(5) That in these circumstances humility becomes us.<p>Our proper situation is in the dust; and whatever calamities may befall us, we should confide in God, and feel that he is qualified to direct our affairs, and the affairs of the universe. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21. their excellency&#8212;(Ps 39:11; 146:4; 1Co 13:8). But Umbreit, by an Oriental image from a bow, useless because unstrung: "Their nerve, or string would be torn away." Michaelis, better in accordance with Job 4:19, makes the allusion be to the cords of a tabernacle taken down (Isa 33:20).<p>they die, even without wisdom&#8212;rather, "They would perish, yet not according to wisdom," but according to arbitrary choice, if God were not infinitely wise and holy. The design of the spirit is to show that the continued existence of weak man proves the inconceivable wisdom and holiness of God, which alone save man from ruin [Umbreit]. Bengel shows from Scripture that God's holiness (Hebrew, kadosh) comprehends all His excellencies and attributes. De Wette loses the scope, in explaining it, of the shortness of man's life, contrasted with the angels "before they have attained to wisdom."   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/job/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Whatsoever is really or by common estimation excellent in men, all their natural, and moral, and civil accomplishments, as high birth, great riches, power, and wisdom, &c.; these are so far from preserving men from perishing, as one would think they should do, that they perish themselves, together with those houses of clay in which they are lodged. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Which is in them go away; </span> or, <span class="ital">go away</span> (i.e. die and perish, as that phrase is oft used as <span class="bld"><a href="/genesis/15-15.htm" title="And you shall go to your fathers in peace; you shall be buried in a good old age.">Genesis 15:15</a> <a href="/joshua/23-14.htm" title="And, behold, this day I am going the way of all the earth: and you know in all your hearts and in all your souls, that not one thing has failed of all the good things which the LORD your God spoke concerning you; all are come to pass to you, and not one thing has failed thereof.">Joshua 23:14</a> <a href="/job/10-21.htm" title="Before I go from where I shall not return, even to the land of darkness and the shadow of death;">Job 10:21</a> <a href="/psalms/58-9.htm" title="Before your pots can feel the thorns, he shall take them away as with a whirlwind, both living, and in his wrath.">Psalm 58:9</a> <a href="/ecclesiastes/12-5.htm" title="Also when they shall be afraid of that which is high, and fears shall be in the way, and the almond tree shall flourish, and the grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire shall fail: because man goes to his long home, and the mourners go about the streets:">Ecclesiastes 12:5</a> <a href="/matthew/26-21.htm" title="And as they did eat, he said, Truly I say to you, that one of you shall betray me.">Matthew 26:21</a></span>) <span class="ital">with</span>, (as <span class="ital">beth</span> is oft used) <span class="ital">them</span>; it doth not survive them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Without wisdom:</span> either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

Moreover, as <span class="ital">folly</span> is oft put for unrighteousness and wickedness, so is wisdom for justice and goodness; which is so known, that it is needless to prove it; and so by wisdom here may be meant that perfect justice and purity which Job arrogated to himself, and which Eliphaz here denies to all men, <span class="bld"><a href="/job/4-17.htm" title="Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his maker?">Job 4:17</a></span>, &c. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/job/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Doth not their excellency which is in them go away?....

Now then since man is such a frail, mortal, foolish, and sinful creature, how can he be just before God, or pure in the sight of his Maker? which, is the thing designed to be proved and illustrated by all this; and here ends the divine oracle, or the revelation made to Eliphaz, when he had the vision before related. <p>(l) "cum ipsis", Piscator; so some in Mercerus and Drusius, and Mr. Broughton.

The word rendered <span class="ital">go away</span> means to <span class="ital">pull out</span>, as a pin or the posts of a gate, <a href="/judges/16-3.htm" title="And Samson lay till midnight, and arose at midnight, and took the doors of the gate of the city, and the two posts, and went away with them, bar and all, and put them on his shoulders, and carried them up to the top of an hill that is before Hebron.">Jdg 16:3</a>; <a href="/judges/16-14.htm" title="And she fastened it with the pin, and said to him, The Philistines be on you, Samson. And he awaked out of his sleep, and went away with the pin of the beam, and with the web.">Jdg 16:14</a> (English version, went away with), or the stake of a tent, <a href="/isaiah/33-20.htm" title="Look on Zion, the city of our solemnities: your eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet habitation, a tabernacle that shall not be taken down; not one of the stakes thereof shall ever be removed, neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken.">Isaiah 33:20</a> (be removed). This is probably the original meaning. Then the word is used in a secondary, more general sense, to break up an encampment, to remove or journey, to depart, e.g. very often in Numbers 33. In the present verse the verb is <span class="ital">pass</span>., and probably has its original sense, plucked up, or torn out. The word translated <span class="ital">excellency</span> has that meaning, e.g. <a href="/genesis/49-3.htm" title="Reuben, you are my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power:">Genesis 49:3</a>; <a href="/proverbs/17-7.htm" title="Excellent speech becomes not a fool: much less do lying lips a prince.">Proverbs 17:7</a>. In other places the word means a <span class="ital">cord</span>, <a href="/context/judges/16-7.htm" title="And Samson said to her, If they bind me with seven green thongs that were never dried, then shall I be weak, and be as another man....">Jdg 16:7-9</a>, the string of a bow, <a href="/psalms/11-2.htm" title="For, see, the wicked bend their bow, they make ready their arrow on the string, that they may privately shoot at the upright in heart.">Psalm 11:2</a>; and similarly <a href="/job/30-11.htm" title="Because he has loosed my cord, and afflicted me, they have also let loose the bridle before me.">Job 30:11</a>. The <span class="ital">figure</span> in the Poet’s mind here is the pulling down of a tent, to which the death of man is compared; so in <a href="/isaiah/38-12.htm" title="My age is departed, and is removed from me as a shepherd's tent: I have cut off like a weaver my life: he will cut me off with pining sickness: from day even to night will you make an end of me.">Isaiah 38:12</a>, where the meaning is, my habitation is removed. The meaning <span class="ital">cord</span> suits this figure better than <span class="ital">excellency</span>, and the sense would be, <span class="ital">their tent-cord is torn away</span>. As to the relation of the two clauses of the verse to one another, the construction is probably the same as in ch. <a href="/job/4-2.htm" title="If we assay to commune with you, will you be grieved? but who can withhold himself from speaking?">Job 4:2</a>, if one should venture … wilt thou be grieved? Therefore,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>If their tent-cord is torn away in them,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Do they not die, and not in wisdom?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>There is an emphasis on <span class="ital">die</span>; the moment the tent falls, through the tearing-away of the cord that upheld it, the inhabitant wholly perishes. It is not necessary to ask what the tent-cord is. The cord belongs to the figure, and is scarcely to be interpreted of the soul.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>They die without attaining unto wisdom. This trait heightens the darkness of the picture of man’s condition. He is not only frail, his frailty is but another side of his moral imperfection, and this cleaves to him to the very end.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>There is something very wise and considerate as well as profoundly reverential in these words of the aged speaker. He does not touch Job’s murmurs directly, but seeks to reach them by suggesting other thoughts to Job. First, he speaks of the exalted purity of God, to awaken reverence in Job’s mind. Then he descends to the creatures and seeks to look at them as they appear unto God. In His eyes, so sublime is He in holiness, all creatures, angels and men, are erring. Thus Eliphaz makes Job cease to be an exception, and renders it more easy for him to reconcile himself to his history and acknowledge the true cause of it. He is but one where all are the same. There is nothing strange in his having sinned (ch. <a href="/context/job/5-6.htm" title="Although affliction comes not forth of the dust, neither does trouble spring out of the ground;...">Job 5:6-7</a>). Neither, therefore, are his afflictions strange. But it will be something strange if he murmurs against God.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Doth not their excellency which is in them go away!</span> "Their excellency" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5ea;&#x5e8;&#x5dd;</span>) would seem to mean that which is highest in them - their spirit, or soul.
