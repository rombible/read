One or other of these supplements seems necessary to complete the sense, and they are either of them natural and easy, being fetched from the former verse. The sense then is, If he put no trust in his angels, how much less will he put any in them that dwell in houses of clay; or, If he charged his angels with folly, how much more will he charge frail and mortal men therewith! What strange presumption then is it for a weak, sinful, and dying man to pretend to a higher privilege than the angels can lay claim to, and to make himself more just and pure than God, which all do, in effect, who complain of, or are impatient under, the righteous dispensations of the divine providence. <span class="ital">That dwell in houses of clay — </span>Whose immortal spirits dwell in mortal bodies, which are great clogs, encumbrances, and snares to them.

Or, <span class="ital">sooner than, </span>or <span class="ital">like as, a moth </span>is crushed, which is easily done by a gentle touch of the finger: an hyperbolical expression.

And, “besides its closer correspondence,” says he, “with the exact import of the Hebrew, presents us with a much finer image of extreme imbecility; for it certainly implies a far greater degree of weakness to be crushed by the feeblest flutter of the feeblest creature, than only to be crushed as easily as that creature by the hand of man.” Certainly no creature is so weak and contemptible, but, one time or other, it may have the body of man in its power.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/job/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:7-11 Eliphaz argues, 1.

Five different Hebrew terms here occur for "lion." The raging of the lion (the tearer), and the roaring of the bellowing lion and the teeth of the young lions, not whelps, but grown up enough to hunt for prey. The strong lion, the whelps of the lioness (not the stout lion, as in English Version) [Barnes and Umbreit]. The various phases of wickedness are expressed by this variety of terms: obliquely, Job, his wife, and children, may be hinted at by the lion, lioness, and whelps. The one verb, "are broken," does not suit both subjects; therefore, supply "the roaring of the bellowing lion is silenced." The strong lion dies of want at last, and the whelps, torn from the mother, are scattered, and the race becomes extinct.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/job/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The voice of the fierce lion; </span><span class="ital"> understand vanisheth</span>, or <span class="ital">perisheth</span>, out of <span class="bld"><a href="/job/4-9.htm" title="By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed.">Job 4:9</a></span>; or, is restrained, or suppressed, as may be gathered out of the following branch of this verse. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The teeth of the young lions are broken; </span> which is true literally; the lions when taken having most commonly their teeth broken, as ancient and modern writers relate.

Which Aben Ezra interprets of God himself, who is compared to a lion; who not only by his voice terrifies, but in his wrath tears the wicked in pieces, and destroys them, and so is a continuation of the preceding account; and others, as R. Moses and R. Jonah, whom he mentions, take this to be a continuation of the means and methods by which God destroys wicked men sometimes, namely, by beasts of prey; this being one of his sore judgments he threatens men with, and inflicts upon men, see <a href="/leviticus/26-22.htm">Leviticus 26:22</a>; and in this they are followed by some Christian interpreters, who render the words "at" or "by the roaring of the lion, and by the voice of the fierce lion, by the teeth of the young lions" (c), they the wicked "are broken", ground to pieces, and utterly destroyed; but it is better, with Jarchi, Ben Gersom, and others, to understand it of kings and princes, of the mighty ones of the earth, tyrannical and oppressive rulers and governors; comparable to lions of different ages; because of their grandeur and greatness, their power and might, their cruelty and oppression in each of their different capacities; signifying, that these do not escape the righteous judgments of God: the Targum interprets the roaring of the lion of Esau, and the voice of the fierce lion of Edom; and another Jewish writer (d) of Nimrod, the first tyrant and oppressor, the mighty hunter before the Lord; but these are too particular; wicked men in power and authority in general are here, and in the following clauses, intended, see <a href="/jeremiah/4-7.htm">Jeremiah 4:7</a> <a href="/2_timothy/4-17.htm">2 Timothy 4:17</a>; and the sense is, that such ploughers and sowers of iniquity as are like to fierce and roaring lions are easily and quickly destroyed by the Lord: <p>and the teeth of the young lions are broken: the power of such mighty ones to do mischief is taken away from them, and they and their families are brought to ruin; the teeth of lions are very strong in both jaws; they have fourteen teeth, four incisors or cutters, four canine or dog teeth, six molars or grinders. <p>(c) "Rugitu leonis et voce ferocis leonis", &amp;c.

The sudden destruction of the wicked is thrown by Eliphaz into another graphic figure, the breaking-up and dispersion of a den of lions. There are five words used for lion in these verses, some of which are epithets taken from the characteristics of the lion; they are: lion, roaring lion (rather than, fierce lion), young lion, <span class="ital"><a href="/job/4-10.htm" title="The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken.">Job 4:10</a></span>, and strong (or, old) lion, and lioness—the whelps of the lioness, <span class="ital"><a href="/job/4-11.htm" title="The old lion perishes for lack of prey, and the stout lion's whelps are scattered abroad.">Job 4:11</a></span>. Between the lion and the wicked whom Eliphaz describes there are two points of resemblance; first, their strength or power; and second, their inherent violence of nature. This is the kind of men on whom afflictions fall that are final. The picture of the breaking-up of the lion’s home is very graphic; in the midst of the strong lion’s roaring and tearing of his prey by a sudden stroke his roaring is silenced and his teeth dashed out; thus disabled he perishes for lack of prey; and the whelps having no provider are scattered abroad. The reality of the figure is seen in the breaking-up of the home of the wicked, ch. <a href="/context/job/5-2.htm" title="For wrath kills the foolish man, and envy slays the silly one....">Job 5:2-5</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken</span>. Wicked men, especially oppressors, are often compared to lions in Scripture (see <a href="/psalms/7-2.htm">Psalm 7:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/10-9.htm">Psalm 10:9</a>; <a href="/psalms/17-12.htm">Psalm 17:12</a>, etc.; <a href="/ezekiel/19-3.htm">Ezekiel 19:3, 5</a>; <a href="/nahum/2-12.htm">Nahum 2:12</a>; <a href="/zephaniah/3-3.htm">Zephaniah 3:3</a>, etc.). The meaning of Eliphaz is that, within his experience, all classes of wicked men, young, or old, or middle-aged, weak or strong, have received in this life the reward of their iniquity. However fiercely they might roar, however greedily they might devour, their roaring has died away, their teeth have been broken in their mouths, vengeance has lighted on them in some shape or other; they have paid the penalty of their transgressions. Five classes of lions seem to be spoken of in this and the following verses: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the whelp (ver. 11); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the half-grown lion, just able to make its voice heard; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the young full-grown lion (<span class="accented">cephir</span>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> the lion in full maturity (<span class="accented">ariyeh</span>); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> the old lion which is growing decrepit (<span class="accented">laish</span>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>To these is joined (ver. 11) <span class="accented">labi</span>, "the lioness." Lions are still frequent in the Mesopotamian region ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 1. pp 39, 221), though no longer found in Palestine, nor in Arabia. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>  2  If one attempts a word with thee, will it grieve thee?<p>And still to restrain himself from words, who is able?<p>  3  Behold, thou hast instructed many,<p>And the weak hands thou hast strengthened.<p>  4  The stumbling turned to thy words,<p>And the sinking knees thou hast strengthened.<p>  5  But now it cometh to thee, thou art grieved;<p>Now it toucheth thee, thou despondest.<p>The question with which Eliphaz beings, is certainly one of those in which the tone of interrogation falls on the second of the paratactically connected sentences: Wilt thou, if we speak to thee, feel it unbearable?
