God, he says, is almighty, infinite, and absolute. How can any man contend with Him, or claim to be pure in His sight? This is the final speech of the friends. Bildad no longer accuses Job; he practically owns himself and his companions worsted in argument, seeing that he attempts no reply, but reiterates truisms that are independent of the special matter in hand. Job, in <a href="/context/job/23-3.htm" title="Oh that I knew where I might find him! that I might come even to his seat!">Job 23:3-12</a>, had spoken of his longing for the Divine judgment; so Bildad labours to deprive him of that confidence, as though he would say, “I have nothing to do with your facts, nor can I explain them; but be that as it may, I am certain that you, or any mortal man, cannot be pure in the sight of God.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/job/25.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/job/25-1.htm" title="Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,">Job 25:1</a></span>. <span class="ital">Then answered Bildad — </span>Who makes the last weak effort against Job; and being unable to deny the truth of his assertions, but at the same time unwilling to give up the argument, shelters himself behind the acknowledged attributes of God, <span class="ital">power, justice, </span>and <span class="ital">purity, </span>and the infirmities of human nature. Probably he and the rest of Job’s friends now perceived that Job and they did not differ so much as they had thought. They owned that the wicked might prosper for a while; and Job owned they would be destroyed at the last. As to the point of bringing Job to confess himself guilty of some enormous crimes, which they at first rashly supposed had drawn this heavy judgment upon him, that is completely given up, and Bildad satisfies himself with an evasive answer to what Job had observed on that head, to this purpose, namely, that no man, strictly speaking, can be justified before God; man being at best a frail and fallible creature, and God a being of infinite purity and perfection; an argument which concerned Job no more than themselves, but equally involved them all in the same class of sinners. This answer has no reference to what Job spake last, but to that which seemed most reproveable in all his discourses, his censure of God’s proceedings with him, and his desire of disputing the matter with him. Bildad’s sentiments are extremely good and pious, but they are but little to the purpose, since he is now reduced to advance what Job had never disputed. “As we here take our leave,” says Dr. Dodd, “of the arguments urged by Job’s friends, we may just observe, in conclusion, that nothing could be more untoward than this conduct of theirs, to bring a charge against him which they could not prove, and from which his well- known virtue and integrity of life ought to have screened him. But, though Job very plainly shows them the injustice and inhumanity of this procedure; nay, though he confutes them so far that they had nothing to reply, yet, like modern disputants, they stood out to the last, and had not the grace to own their mistake, till God himself was pleased to thunder it in their ears. Here, then, we have a lively instance of the force of prejudice and prepossession.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/job/25.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>25:1-6 Bildad shows that man cannot be justified before God. - Bildad drops the question concerning the prosperity of wicked men; but shows the infinite distance there is between God and man. He represents to Job some truths he had too much overlooked. Man's righteousness and holiness, at the best, are nothing in comparison with God's, Ps 89:6. As God is so great and glorious, how can man, who is guilty and impure, appear before him? We need to be born again of water and of the Holy Ghost, and to be bathed again and again in the blood of Christ, that Fountain opened, Zec 13:1. We should be humbled as mean, guilty, polluted creatures, and renounce self-dependence. But our vileness will commend Christ's condescension and love; the riches of his mercy and the power of his grace will be magnified to all eternity by every sinner he redeems.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And if it be not so now, who will make me a liar? - A challenge to anyone to prove the contrary to what he had said. Job had now attacked their main position, and had appealed to facts in defense of what he held. He maintained that, as a matter of fact, the wicked were prospered, that they often lived to old age, and that they then died a peaceful death, without any direct demonstration of the divine displeasure. He boldly appeals, now, to anyone to deny this, or to prove the contrary. The appeal was decisive. The fact was undeniable, and the controversy was closed. Bildad <a href="//biblehub.com/job/25-1.htm">Job 25:1-6</a> attempts a brief reply, but he does not touch the question about the facts to which Job had appealed, but utters a few vague and irrelevant proverbial maxims, about the greatness of God, and is silent. His proverbs appear to be exhausted, and the theory which he and his friends had so carefully built up, and in which they had been so confident, was now overthrown. Perhaps this was one design of the Holy Spirit, in recording the argument thus far conducted, to show that the theory of the divine administration, which had been built up with so much care, and which was sustained by so many proverbial maxims, was false. The overthrow of this theory was of sufficient importance to justify this protracted argument, because:<p>(1) it was and is of the highest importance that correct views should prevail of the nature of the divine administration; and<p>(2) it is of special importance in comforting the afflicted people of God.<p>Job had experienced great aggravation, in his sufferings, from the position which his friends had maintained, and from the arguments which they had been able to adduce, to prove that his sufferings were proof that he was a hypocrite. But it is worth all which it has cost; all the experience of the afflicted friends of God, and all the pains taken to reveal it, to show that affliction is no certain proof of the divine displeasure, and that important ends may be accomplished by means of trial. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/25.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 25<p>THIRD SERIES.<p>Job 25:1-6.

Bildad, in his weak reply, entirely avoids the subject, and limits himself to briefly touching two old and well-worn topics - the might of God (vers. 2, 3) and the universal sinfulness of men. On neither of these two points does he throw any fresh light. He avoids, however, the reckless charges of Eliphaz (<a href="/job/22-5.htm">Job 22:5-9</a>) as well as the coarse menaces of Zophar (<a href="/job/20-5.htm">Job 20:5-29</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1, 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said, Dominion and fear are with him</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> with God).

The meaning may be that, through these high attributes, God <span class="accented">maintains</span> peace among the dwellers in the supernal regions; but beyond this there is a possible allusion to a time in which peace was disturbed, and the Almighty had to "make" it, or re-establish it, (On the subject of the "war in heaven,"  and the defeat and subjection of the rebels, see the comment on Job 9:13.) <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/24.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>18  For he is light upon the surface of the water;<p>Their heritage is cursed upon the earth;<p>He turneth no more in the way of the vineyard.<p>19  Drought, also heat, snatch away snow water - <p>So doth Shel those who have sinned.<p>20  The womb forgetteth him, worms shall feast on him,<p>He is no more remembered;<p>So the desire of the wicked is broken as a tree - <p>21  He who hath plundered the barren that bare not,<p>And did no good to the widow.<p>The point of comparison in <a href="/job/24-18.htm">Job 24:18</a> is the swiftness of the disappearing: he is carried swiftly past, as any light substance on the surface of the water is hurried along by the swiftness of the current, and can scarcely be seen; comp. <a href="/job/9-26.htm">Job 9:26</a> : "My days shoot by as ships of reeds, as an eagle which dasheth upon its prey," and <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/10-7.htm">Hosea 10:7</a>, "Samaria's king is destroyed like a bundle of brushwood (lxx, Theod., &#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;) on the face of the water," which is quickly drawn into the whirlpool, or buried by the approaching wave.<p>(Note: The translation: like foam (spuma or bulla), is also very suitable here.

The two incidents are alike: the death of those whose life has been a life of sin, follows as a consequence easily and unobserved, without any painful and protracted struggle. The sinner disappears suddenly; the womb, i.e., the mother that bare him, forgets him (&#1512;&#1495;&#1501;, matrix  equals  mater; according to Ralbag: friendship, from &#1512;&#1495;&#1501;, to love tenderly; others: relationship, in which sense Arab. rah&#803;imun  equals  &#1512;&#1495;&#1501; is used), worms suck at him (&#1502;&#1514;&#1511;&#1493; for &#1502;&#1514;&#1511;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, according to Ges. 147, a, sugit eum, from which primary notion of sucking comes the signification to be sweet, <a href="/job/21-33.htm">Job 21:33</a> : Syriac, metkat ennun remto; Ar. imtasahum, from the synonymous Arab. mas&#803;s&#803;a  equals  &#1502;&#1510;&#1509;, &#1502;&#1510;&#1492;, &#1502;&#1494;&#1492;), he is no more thought of, and thus then is mischief (abstr. pro concr. as <a href="/job/5-16.htm">Job 5:16</a>) broken like a tree (not: a staff, which &#1506;&#1509; never, not even in <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/4-12.htm">Hosea 4:12</a>, directly, like the Arabic &#8219;asa, &#8219;asa&#770;t, signifies).

His want of compassion (as is still too often seen in the present day in connection with the tyrannical conduct of the executive in Syria and Palestine, especially on the part of those who collected the taxes) goes the length of eating up, i.e., entirely plundering, the barren, childless (<a href="/genesis/11-30.htm">Genesis 11:30</a>; <a href="/isaiah/54-1.htm">Isaiah 54:1</a>), and therefore helpless woman, who has no sons to protect and defend her, and never showing favour to the widow, but, on the contrary, thrusting her away from him.

Here the allusion is to the remembrance of a mother's love and sympathetic feeling.
