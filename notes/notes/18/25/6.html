He represents to Job some truths he had too much overlooked. Man's righteousness and holiness, at the best, are nothing in comparison with God's, Ps 89:6. As God is so great and glorious, how can man, who is guilty and impure, appear before him? We need to be born again of water and of the Holy Ghost, and to be bathed again and again in the blood of Christ, that Fountain opened, Zec 13:1. We should be humbled as mean, guilty, polluted creatures, and renounce self-dependence. But our vileness will commend Christ's condescension and love; the riches of his mercy and the power of his grace will be magnified to all eternity by every sinner he redeems.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>How much less man - See <a href="/job/4-19.htm">Job 4:19</a>. Man is mentioned here as a worm; in <a href="/job/4-19.htm">Job 4:19</a> he is said to dwell in a house of clay and to be crushed before the moth. In both cases the design is to represent him as insignificant in comparison with God.<p>A worm - &#1512;&#1502;&#1492;  r&#305;&#770;mma&#770;h; see <a href="/job/7-5.htm">Job 7:5</a>. The word is commonly applied to such worms as are bred in putridity, and hence, the comparison is the more forcible.<p>And the son of man - Another mode of speaking of man. Any one of the children of man is the same. No one of them can be compared with God; compare the notes at <a href="/matthew/1-1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>.<p>Which is a worm - &#1514;&#1493;&#1500;&#1506;&#1492;  to&#770;le&#770;&#8219;a&#770;h; compare the notes at <a href="/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a>. This word frequently denotes the worm from which the scarlet or crimson color was obtained. It is, however, used to denote the worm that is bred on putrid substances, and is so used here; compare <a href="/exodus/16-20.htm">Exodus 16:20</a>; <a href="/isaiah/14-11.htm">Isaiah 14:11</a>; <a href="/isaiah/66-24.htm">Isaiah 66:24</a>. It is also applied to a worm that destroys plants. <a href="/jonah/4-7.htm">Jonah 4:7</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/28-39.htm">Deuteronomy 28:39</a>. Here it means, that man is poor, feeble, powerless. In comparison with God he is a crawling worm. All that is said in this chapter is true and beautiful, but it has nothing to do with the subject in debate. Job had appealed to the course of events in proof of the truth of his position. The true way to meet that was either to deny that the facts existed as he alleged, or to show that they did not prove what be had adduced them to establish. But Bildad did neither; nor did he ingenuously confess that the argument was against him and his friends. At this stage of the controversy, since they had nothing to reply to what Job had alleged, it would have been honorable in them to have acknowledged that they were in error, and to have yielded the palm of victory to him. But it requires extraordinary candor and humility to do that; and rather than do it, most people would prefer to say something - though it has nothing to do with the case in hand. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/25.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6.

The Targum is, <p>"how much more man, who in his life is a reptile, and the son of man, who in his death is a worm?'' <p>to which may be added, that he is in his grave a companion for the worms; and indeed it appears by the observations made through microscopes, that man, in his first state of generation, is really a worm (p); so that, as Pliny says (q), one that is a judge of things may pity and be ashamed of the sorry original of the proudest of animals. By this short reply of Bildad, and which contains little more than what had been before said, it is plain that he was tired of the controversy, and glad to give out. <p>(p) Lewenhoeck apud Scheuchzer.

How much less can man be pure in God's sight? An undoubted truth, or rather, perhaps, a truism, but not to the point, for Job has never really maintained that he is without sin (see ch. 7:20, 21; 9:2, 20, etc.). He has only maintained that his sins have not been of such a character as to account for his sufferings. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/24.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>22  And He preserveth the mighty by His strength;<p>Such an one riseth again, though he despaired of life.<p>23  He giveth him rest, and he is sustained,<p>And His eyes are over their ways.<p>24  They are exalted - a little while, - then they are no more,<p>And they are sunken away, snatched away like all others,<p>And as the top of the stalk they are cut off. - <p>25  And if it is not so, who will charge me with lying,<p>And make my assertion worthless?<p>Though it becomes manifest after their death how little the ungodly, who were only feared by men, were beloved, the form of their death itself is by no means such as to reveal the retributive justice of God.

These, whose trust in their own strength God might smite down by His almighty power, He preserves alive even in critical positions by that very power: he (the &#1488;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;) stands up (again), whilst he does not trust to life, i.e., whilst he believes that he must succumb to death (&#1492;&#1488;&#1502;&#1497;&#1503; as <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/27-13.htm">Psalm 27:13</a>, comp. Genesis, S. 368; &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503;, Aramaic form, like &#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503;, <a href="/job/4-2.htm">Job 4:2</a>; <a href="/job/12-11.htm">Job 12:11</a>; the whole is a contracted circumstantial clause for &#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1488; &#1500;&#1488; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;). He (God) grants him &#1500;&#1489;&#1496;&#1495;, in security, viz., to live, or even directly: a secure peaceful existence, since &#1500;&#1489;&#1496;&#1495; is virtually an object, and the &#1500; is that of condition (comp. &#1500;&#1512;&#1489;, <a href="/job/26-3.htm">Job 26:3</a>). Thus Hahn, who, however, here is only to be followed in this one particular, takes it correctly: and that he can support himself, which would only be possible if an inf. with &#1500; had preceded. Therefore: and he is supported or he can support himself, i.e., be comforted, though this absolute use of &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1503; cannot be supported; in this instance we miss &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1496;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;, or some such expression (<a href="/job/8-15.htm">Job 8:15</a>).

"They are risen up, and are conscious of the height (of prosperity) - a little while, and they are no more." Thus <a href="/job/24-24.htm">Job 24:24</a> is to be explained. The accentuation &#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1493; with Mahpach, &#1502;&#1506;&#1496; with Asla legarmeh (according to which it would have to be translated: they stand on high a short time), is erroneous. The verb &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; signifies not merely to be high, but also to rise up, raise one's self, e.g., <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/11-11.htm">Proverbs 11:11</a>, and to show one's self exalted, here extulerunt se in altum or exaltati sunt; according to the form of writing &#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; is treated as an Ayin Waw verb med.

There is no reference in the phrase to the componere artus, <a href="/genesis/49-33.htm">Genesis 49:33</a>; it is rather the figure of housing (gathering into the barn) that underlies it; the word, however, only implies seizing and drawing in. Thus the figure which follows is also naturally (comp. &#1511;&#1502;&#1509;, Arab. qabd&#803;at, manipulus) connected with what precedes, and, like the head of an ear of corn, i.e., the corn-bearing head of the wheat-stalk, they are cut off (by which one must bear in mind that the ears are reaped higher up than with us, and the standing stalk is usually burnt to make dressing for the field; vid., Ges. Thes. s.v. &#1511;&#1513;&#1473;).<p>(Note: Another figure is also presented here. It is a common thing for the Arabs (Beduins) in harvest-time to come down upon the fields of standing corn - especially barley, because during summer and autumn this grain is indispensable to them as food for their horses - of a district, chiefly at night, and not unfrequently hundreds of camels are laden at one time. As they have no sickles, they cut off the upper part of the stalk with the &#8219;aqfe (a knife very similar to the Roman sica) and with sabres, whence this theft is called qard &#1511;&#1512;&#1509;, sabring off; and that which is cut off, as well as the uneven stubble that is left standing, is called qarid. - Wetzst.)).<p>On &#1497;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; (fut.

But Job does not answer like by like. Even in this speech in opposition to the friends, he maintains the passionless repose which has once been gained. Although the misjudgment of his character has attained its height in the speech of Eliphaz, his answer does not contain a single bitter personal word. In general, he does not address them, not as though he did not wish to show respect to them, but because he has nothing to say concerning their unjust and wrong conduct that he would not already have said, and because he has lost all hope of his reproof taking effect, all hope of sympathy with his entreaty that they would spare him, all hope of understanding and information on their part.<p>continued...</body></html>
