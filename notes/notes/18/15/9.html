He unjustly charges Job with casting off the fear of God, and all regard to him, and restraining prayer. See in what religion is summed up, fearing God, and praying to him; the former the most needful principle, the latter the most needful practice. Eliphaz charges Job with self-conceit. He charges him with contempt of the counsels and comforts given him by his friends. We are apt to think that which we ourselves say is important, when others, with reason, think little of it. He charges him with opposition to God. Eliphaz ought not to have put harsh constructions upon the words of one well known for piety, and now in temptation. It is plain that these disputants were deeply convinced of the doctrine of original sin, and the total depravity of human nature. Shall we not admire the patience of God in bearing with us? and still more his love to us in the redemption of Christ Jesus his beloved Son?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>What knowest thou that we know not? - What pretensions or claims to wisdom have you which we have not?

Abandoning irony Eliphaz comes to the facts, which hardly bear out Jobâ€™s pretensions.

Job was not more advanced in knowledge than Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar. But he had a keener spiritual insight. He was wiser in the "wisdom which is from above." Perplexed and confused as were his thoughts concerning the Divine government of the universe, they were nearer the truth, more worthy of the  Divine nature, than those of his adversaries. In his reply, without claiming any special wisdom, he pours contempt on their pretensions to spiritual understanding (<a href="/job/17-4.htm">Job 17:4, 10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">What understandest thou, which is not in us?</span> A mere repetition of the first member of the verse in different words. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>  1  Then began Eliphaz the Temanite, and said:<p>  2  Doth a wise man utter vain knowledge,<p>And fill his breast with the east wind?<p>  3  Contending with words, that profit not,<p>And speeches, by which no good is done?<p>  4  Moreover, thou makest void the fear of God,<p>And thou restrainest devotion before God;<p>  5  For thy mouth exposeth thy misdeeds,<p>And thou choosest the language of the crafty.<p>  6  Thine own mouth condemneth thee and not I,<p>And thine own lips testify against thee.<p>The second course of the controversy is again opened by Eliphaz, the most respectable, most influential, and perhaps oldest of the friends. Job's detailed and bitter answers seem to him as empty words and impassioned tirades, which ill become a wise man, such as he claims to be in assertions like <a href="/job/12-3.htm">Job 12:3</a>; <a href="/job/13-2.htm">Job 13:2</a>. &#1492;&#1495;&#1500;&#1501; with He interr., like &#1492;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492;, <a href="/job/13-25.htm">Job 13:25</a>. &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;, wind, is the opposite of what is solid and sure; and &#1511;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; in the parallel (like <a href="/hosea/12-2.htm">Hosea 12:2</a>) signifies what is worthless, with the additional notion of vehement action. If we translate &#1489;&#1468;&#1496;&#1503; by "belly," the meaning is apt to be misunderstood; it is not intended as the opposite of &#1500;&#1489; fo et (Ewald), but it means, especially in the book of Job, not only that which feels, but also thinks and wills, the spiritually receptive and active inner nature of man (Psychol. S. 266); as also in Arabic, el-battin signifies that which is within, in the deepest mystical sense. Hirz. and Renan translate the inf. abs. &#1492;&#1493;&#1499;&#1495;, which follows in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/15-3.htm">Job 15:3</a>, as verb. fin.: se dfend-il par des vaines paroles; but though the inf. abs. is so used in an historical clause (<a href="/job/15-35.htm">Job 15:35</a>), it is not an interrogative. Ewald takes it as the subject: "to reprove with words-avails not, and speeches - whereby one does no good;" but though &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; and &#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; might be used without any further defining, as in &#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd; (<a href="/2_timothy/2-14.htm">2 Timothy 2:14</a>) and &#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; (<a href="/1_timothy/6-4.htm">1 Timothy 6:4</a>), the form of <a href="/job/15-3.htm">Job 15:3</a> is opposed to such an explanation. The inf. abs. is connected as a gerund (redarguendo s. disputando) with the verbs in the question, <a href="/job/15-2.htm">Job 15:2</a>; and the elliptical relative clause &#1497;&#1505;&#1499;&#1468;&#1503; &#1500;&#1488; is best, as referring to things, according to <a href="/job/35-3.htm">Job 35:3</a> : sermone (&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1491; from &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;, as sermo from serere) qui non prodest; &#1489;&#1468;&#1501; &#1497;&#1493;&#1506;&#1497;&#1500; &#1500;&#1488;, on the other hand, to persons, verbis quibus nil utilitatis affert. Eliphaz does not censure Job for arguing, but for defending himself by such useless and purposeless utterances of his feeling. But still more than that: his speeches are not only unsatisfactory and unbecoming, &#1488;&#1507;, accedit quod (cumulative like <a href="/job/14-3.htm">Job 14:3</a>), they are moreover irreligious, since by doubting the justice of God they deprive religion of its fundamental assumption, and diminish the reverence due to God. &#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; in such an objective sense as <a href="/psalms/19-10.htm">Psalm 19:10</a> almost corresponds to the idea of religion. &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1495;&#1492; &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1470;&#1488;&#1500; is to be understood, according to <a href="/psalms/102-1.htm">Psalm 102:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/142-3.htm">Psalm 142:3</a> (comp. <a href="/psalms/64-2.htm">Psalm 64:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/104-34.htm">Psalm 104:34</a>): before God, and consequently customary devotional meditation, here of the disposition of mind indispensable to prayer, viz., devotion, and especially reverential awe, which Job depreciates (&#1490;&#1468;&#1512;&#1506;, detrahere). His speeches are mostly directed towards God; but they are violent and reproachful, therefore irreverent in form and substance.</body></html>
