But because many of God's people have prospered in this world, it does not therefore follow that those who are crossed and made poor, as Job, are not God's people. Eliphaz shows also that wicked people, particularly oppressors, are subject to continual terror, live very uncomfortably, and perish very miserably. Will the prosperity of presumptuous sinners end miserably as here described? Then let the mischiefs which befal others, be our warnings. Though no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous, nevertheless, afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruits of righteousness to them that are exercised thereby. No calamity, no trouble, however heavy, however severe, can rob a follower of the Lord of his favour.

Eliphaz professes to urge nothing which had not been handed down from his ancestors, and was the result of careful observation. What he says is made up of apothegms and maxims that were regarded as containing the results of ancient wisdom, all meaning that God would punish the wicked, or that the wicked would be treated according to their deserts. The implied inference all along was, that Job, who had had so many proofs of the divine displeasure, must be a wicked man. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17. In direct contradiction of Job's position (Job 12:6, &c.), that the lot of the wicked was the most prosperous here, Eliphaz appeals (1) to his own experience, (2) to the wisdom of the ancients.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/job/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> I will prove what I have affirmed, that such strokes as thine are peculiar to hypocrites and wicked men.

Here Eliphaz proceeds to illustrate and make plain, to clear and defend, his former sentiment and proposition, and into which the rest of his friends came; that only wicked, and not righteous men, are afflicted of God, especially in such a manner as Job was; and he proposes to show things worthy of his regard, and not such vain and unprofitable things which Job had uttered; and, in order to stir up and engage his attention, he says what follows: <p>and that which I have seen I will declare; what he had been an eyewitness of himself; the same he had observed, <a href="/job/4-8.htm">Job 4:8</a>; and such testimonies are most regarded, and reckoned most authentic and creditable, especially when they come from men of character; see <a href="/luke/1-1.htm">Luke 1:1</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/15.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">I will shew thee, hear me; and that which I have seen I will declare;</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/job/15.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">17</span>. <span class="ital">I will shew thee</span>] Eliphaz assumes a high tone with Job; one is entitled to do so with a man in his unfortunate condition.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>17–35.

Eliphaz here introduces, with an elaborate preface (vers. 17-19) what is either a citation from a book, as Professor Lee thinks, or a studied description by himself of the proceedings and consequent sufferings of the wicked. This description extends from ver. 20 to the end of the chapter, and is plainly levelled at Job, though it may originally have been intended to apply to some other person or persons. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>11  Are the consolations of God too small for thee,<p>And a word thus tenderly spoken with thee?<p>12  What overpowers thy hearts?<p>And why do thine eyes wink,<p>13  That thou turnest thy snorting against God,<p>And sendest forth such words from thy mouth?<p>By the consolations of God, Eliphaz means the promises in accordance with the majesty and will of God, by which he and the other friends have sought to cheer him, of course presupposing a humble resignation to the just hand of God.
