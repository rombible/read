But because many of God's people have prospered in this world, it does not therefore follow that those who are crossed and made poor, as Job, are not God's people. Eliphaz shows also that wicked people, particularly oppressors, are subject to continual terror, live very uncomfortably, and perish very miserably. Will the prosperity of presumptuous sinners end miserably as here described? Then let the mischiefs which befal others, be our warnings. Though no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous, nevertheless, afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruits of righteousness to them that are exercised thereby.

As a consequence of his opposing God, and devoting himself to a life of sensuality and ease, he shall dwell in a desolate place. Instead of living in affluence and in a splendid city, he shall be compelled to take up his abode in places that have been deserted and abandoned. Such places - like Petra or Babylon now - became the temporary lodgings of caravans and travelers, or the abodes of outcasts and robbers.

This is either a continuation of the account of the wicked man's prosperity, which makes him haughty; such is his might and power, that he destroys cities and palaces, built and enjoyed by others, and then out of the ruins of them builds greater cities and more noble palaces, to perpetuate his name to posterity; which sense agrees with <a href="/job/3-14.htm">Job 3:14</a>; and with the Targum, <p>"and he makes tabernacles in desert cities, that he may dwelt in houses which were not inhabited;'' <p>and so Ben Gersom: and hence because of his success among men, and the grandeur he lives in, his heart is lifted up, and his hand is stretched out against God; or else this may express the sinful course of life such a man lives, who chooses to dwell in desolate places, and deserts, to do harm to others, to seize upon travellers as they pass by, and rob and plunder them of their substance, sitting and waiting for them in such places, as the Arabians in the wilderness, <a href="/jeremiah/3-2.htm">Jeremiah 3:2</a>; which is the sense of some, as Aben Ezra observes; or rather this points at the punishment of the wicked man, who though for the present may be in great prosperity, possessed of large cities and stately palaces, "yet" or "but" (a), for so the particle may be rendered, "he dwelleth in desolate cities"; in such as shall become desolate, being destroyed by a superior enemy, that shall come upon him; or through his subjects forsaking him, not being able to bear his tyranny and cruelty; or he shall be driven from his dominions by them, and be obliged to fly, and dwell in desert places; or he shall choose to dwell there, through the horrors of a guilty conscience; or, best of all, he shall be reduced to such distress and poverty, that he shall not have a house fit to dwell in; but "shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness, in a salt land, and not inhabited", <a href="/jeremiah/17-6.htm">Jeremiah 17:6</a>; as follows: <p>and in houses which no man inhabiteth, which are ready to become heaps; such as have been deserted by their former inhabitants, because come to decay, and ready to fall down upon them, and become heaps of stones and rubbish. <p>(a) So the Annotator of the Assembly of Divines. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/15.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And he dwelleth <span class="cverse3">{r}</span> in desolate cities, <i>and</i> in houses which no man inhabiteth, which are ready to become heaps.</span><p>(r) Though he build and repair ruinous places to gain fame, yet God will bring all to nothing, and turn his great prosperity into extreme misery.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/job/15.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">28</span>. <span class="ital">and he dwelleth</span>] <span class="bld">and he dwelt</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">which no man inhabiteth</span>] <span class="bld">which should not be inhabited</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">are ready to become</span>] <span class="bld">which were destined to be heaps</span>. The idea seems to be that the wicked man settled in and rebuilt places that were under the curse of God, and destined by Him for perpetual desolation. Such places in the East are those on which God’s judgment has fallen because of some great wickedness perpetrated there. To settle in and rebuild such ruins indicates the extreme of impiety, cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/13-13.htm" title="Certain men, the children of Belial, are gone out from among you, and have withdrawn the inhabitants of their city, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which you have not known;">Deuteronomy 13:13</a> <span class="ital">seq</span>.; <a href="/joshua/6-26.htm" title="And Joshua adjured them at that time, saying, Cursed be the man before the LORD, that rises up and builds this city Jericho: he shall lay the foundation thereof in his firstborn, and in his youngest son shall he set up the gates of it.">Joshua 6:26</a>; <a href="/1_kings/16-34.htm" title="In his days did Hiel the Bethelite build Jericho: he laid the foundation thereof in Abiram his firstborn, and set up the gates thereof in his youngest son Segub, according to the word of the LORD, which he spoke by Joshua the son of Nun.">1 Kings 16:34</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he dwelleth in desolate cities</span>.

Most expositors translate the next line: and throughout the number of the years, which are reserved to the tyrant. But (1) this parallel definition of time appended by waw makes the sense drawling; (2) the change of &#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1509; (oppressor, tyrant) for &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; leads one to expect a fresh affirmation, hence it is translated by the lxx: &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1; &#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#837;. The predicate is, then, like <a href="//biblehub.com/job/32-7.htm">Job 32:7</a>, comp. <a href="/job/29-10.htm">Job 29:10</a>; <a href="/job/2-4.htm">Job 2:4</a> (Ges. 148), per attractionem in the plur. instead of in the sing., and especially with &#1502;&#1505;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512; followed by gen. plur.; this attraction is adopted by our author, <a href="/job/21-21.htm">Job 21:21</a>; <a href="/job/38-21.htm">Job 38:21</a>. The meaning is not, that numbered, i.e., few, years are secretly appointed to the tyrant, which must have been sh'no&#770;th mispa&#770;r, a reversed position of the words, as <a href="/job/16-22.htm">Job 16:22</a>; <a href="/numbers/9-20.htm">Numbers 9:20</a> (vid., Gesenius' Thes.); but a (limited, appointed) number of years is reserved to the tyrant (&#1510;&#1508;&#1503; as <a href="/job/24-1.htm">Job 24:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/21-19.htm">Job 21:19</a>, comp. &#1496;&#1502;&#1503;, <a href="/job/20-26.htm">Job 20:26</a>; Mercerus: occulto decreto definiti), after the expiration of which his punishment begins. The thought expressed by the Targ., Syr., and Jerome would be suitable: and the number of the years (that he has to live unpunished) is hidden from the tyrant; but if this were the poet's meaning, he would have written &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493;, and must have written &#1502;&#1503;&#1470;&#1492;&#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1509;.<p>With regard to the following <a href="//biblehub.com/job/15-21.htm">Job 15:21-24</a>, it is doubtful whether only the evil-doer's anxiety of spirit is described in amplification of &#1492;&#1493;&#1488; &#1502;&#1514;&#1495;&#1493;&#1500;&#1500;, or also how the terrible images from which he suffers in his conscience are realized, and how he at length helplessly succumbs to the destruction which his imagination had long foreboded. A satisfactory and decisive answer to this question is hardly possible; but considering that the real crisis is brought on by Eliphaz later, and fully described, it seems more probable that what has an objective tone in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/15-21.htm">Job 15:21-24</a> is controlled by what has been affirmed respecting the evil conscience of the ungodly, and is to be understood accordingly. The sound of terrible things (startling dangers) rings in his ears; the devastator comes upon him (&#1489;&#1493;&#1488; seq. acc. as <a href="/job/20-22.htm">Job 20:22</a>; <a href="/proverbs/28-22.htm">Proverbs 28:22</a>; comp. <a href="/isaiah/28-15.htm">Isaiah 28:15</a>) in the midst of his prosperity. He anticipates it ere it happens. From the darkness by which he feels himself menaced, he believes not (&#1492;&#1488;&#1502;&#1497;&#1503; seq. infin. as <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/27-13.htm">Psalm 27:13</a>, &#1500;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;, of confident hope) to return; i.e., overwhelmed with a consciousness of his guilt, he cannot, in the presence of this darkness which threatens him, raise to the hope of rescue from it, and he is really - as his consciousness tells him - &#1510;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468; (like &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468;, <a href="/job/41-25.htm">Job 41:25</a>; Ges. 75, rem. 5; Keri &#1510;&#1508;&#1493;&#1497;, which is omitted in our printed copies, contrary to the testimony of the Masora and the authority of correct MSS), spied out for, appointed to the sword, i.e., of God (<a href="/job/19-29.htm">Job 19:29</a>; <a href="/isaiah/31-8.htm">Isaiah 31:8</a>), or decreed by God. In the midst of abundance he is harassed by the thought of becoming poor; he wanders about in search of bread, anxiously looking out and asking where? (abrupt, like &#1492;&#1504;&#1492;, <a href="/job/9-19.htm">Job 9:19</a>), i.e., where is any to be found, whence can I obtain it? The lxx translates contrary to the connection, and with a strange misunderstanding of the passage: &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; &#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3c8;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd; (&#1488;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; &#1500;&#1495;&#1501;, food for the vulture). He sees himself in the mirror of the future thus reduced to beggary; he knows that a day of darkness stands in readiness (&#1504;&#1499;&#1493;&#1503;, like <a href="/job/18-12.htm">Job 18:12</a>), is at his hand, i.e., close upon him (&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;, elsewhere in this sense &#1500;&#1497;&#1491;, <a href="/psalms/140-6.htm">Psalm 140:6</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-3.htm">1 Samuel 19:3</a>, and &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1497;&#1491;&#1497;, <a href="/job/1-14.htm">Job 1:14</a>).<p>In accordance with the previous exposition, we shall now interpret &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511;&#1492; &#1510;&#1512;, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/15-24.htm">Job 15:24</a>, not of need and distress, but subjectively of fear and oppression. They come upon him suddenly and irresistibly; it seizes or overpowers him (&#1514;&#1468;&#1514;&#1511;&#1508;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; with neutral subject; an unknown something, a dismal power) as a king &#1506;&#1514;&#1497;&#1491; &#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1512;. lxx &#x3c9;&#788;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1; &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;, like a leader falling in the first line of the battle, which is an imaginary interpretation of the text. The translation of the Targum also, sicut regem qui paratus est ad scabellum (to serve the conqueror as a footstool), furnishes no explanation. Another Targum translation (in Nachmani and elsewhere) is: sicut rex qui paratus est circumdare se legionibus. According to this, &#1499;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1512; comes from &#1499;&#1468;&#1491;&#1512;, to surround, be round (comp. &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1512;, whence &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1512;, Assyr. cudar, &#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, perhaps also &#1492;&#1494;&#1512;, Syr. &#1495;&#1491;&#1512;, whence chedor, a circle, round about); and it is assumed, that as &#1499;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; signifies a ball (not only in Talmudic, but also in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/22-18.htm">Isaiah 22:18</a>, which is to be translated: rolling he rolleth thee into a ball, a ball in a spacious land), so &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1512;, a round encampment, an army encamped in a circle, synon. of &#1502;&#1506;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500;. In the first signification the word certainly furnishes no suitable sense in connection with &#1506;&#1514;&#1497;&#1491;; but one may, with Kimchi, suppose that &#1499;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1512;, like the Italian torniamento, denotes the circle as well as the tournament, or the round of conflict, i.e., the conflict which moves round about, like tumult of battle, which last is a suitable meaning here. The same appropriate meaning is attained, however, if the root is taken, like the Arabic kdr, in the signification turbidum esse (comp. &#1511;&#1491;&#1512;, <a href="/job/6-16.htm">Job 6:16</a>), which is adopted of misfortunes as troubled experiences of life (according to which Schultens translates: destinatus est ad turbulentissimas fortunas, beginning a new thought with &#1506;&#1514;&#1497;&#1491;, which is not possible, since &#1499;&#1502;&#1500;&#1498; by itself is no complete figure), and may perhaps also be referred to the tumult of battle, tumultus bellici conturbatio (Rosenm.); or of, with Fleischer, one starts from another turn of the idea of the root, viz., to be compressed, solid, thick, which is a more certain way gives the meaning of a dense crowd.<p>(Note: The Arab. verb kdr belongs to the root kd, to smite, thrust, quatere, percutere, tundere, trudere; a root that has many branches. It is I. transitive cadara (fut. jacduru, inf. cadr) - by the non-adoption of which from the original lexicons our lexicographers have deprived the whole etymological development of its groundwork - in the signification to pour, hurl down, pour out, e.g., cadara-l-ma, he has spilt, poured out, thrown down the water; hence in the medial VII. form incadara intransitive, to fall, fall down, chiefly of water and other fluids, as of the rain which pours down from heaven, of a cascade, and the like; then improperly of a bird of prey which shoots down from the air upon its prey (e.g., in the poetry in Beidhwi on Sur. 81, 2: "The hawk saw some bustards on the plain f'ancadara, and rushed down"); of a hostile host which rushes upon the enemy first possible signification for &#1499;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1512;]; of a man, horse, etc., which runs very swiftly, effuse currit, effuso curru ruit; of the stars that shall fall from heaven at the last day (Sur. 81, 2). Then also II. intransitive cadara (fut. jacdiru) with the secondary form cadira (fut. jacdaru) and cadura (fut. jacduru), prop. to be shaken and jolted; then also of fluid things, mixed and mingled, made turgid, unclean, i.e., by shaking, jolting, stirring, etc., with the dregs (the cudre or cudde); then gen. turbidum, non limpidum (opp. Arab. s&#803;f'), with a similar transition of meaning to that in turbare (comp. deturbare) and the German trben (comp. traben or trappen, treiben, treffen). The primary meaning of the root takes another III. turn in the derived adjectives cudur, cudurr, cundur, cundir, compressed, solid, thick; the last word with us (Germans) forms a transition from cadir, cadr, cadr, dull, slimy, yeasty, etc., inasmuch as we speak of dickes Bier (thick beer), etc., cerevisia spissa, de la bire paisse. Here the point of contact of the word &#1499;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1512;, tumult of battle, &#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;, seems indicated: a dense crowd and tumult, where one is close upon another; as also &#1504;&#1500;&#1495;&#1501;, &#1502;&#1500;&#1495;&#1502;&#1492;, signify not reciprocal destruction, slaughter, but to press firmly and closely upon one another, a dense crowd. - Fl.)<p>continued...</body></html>
