But because many of God's people have prospered in this world, it does not therefore follow that those who are crossed and made poor, as Job, are not God's people. Eliphaz shows also that wicked people, particularly oppressors, are subject to continual terror, live very uncomfortably, and perish very miserably. Will the prosperity of presumptuous sinners end miserably as here described? Then let the mischiefs which befal others, be our warnings. Though no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous, nevertheless, afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruits of righteousness to them that are exercised thereby.

He has no fear of God, nor shame for his sin; he blushes not to rise up against God in the manner he does, because his eyes stand out with fatness; or rather his face is covered with it, that is, he abounds in riches, he enjoys great prosperity, a large affluence of all good things; and this makes him haughty and imperious, neither to fear God, nor regard man like Jeshurun, who, when he "waxed fat, was grown thick, and covered with fatness, kicked" against God, and his providences, sinned and rebelled against him; "forsook God which made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation", <a href="/deuteronomy/32-15.htm">Deuteronomy 32:15</a>; and to the same purpose is the following clause: <p>and maketh collops of fat in his flanks; a description of a very fat man, and one that pampers the flesh, and indulges himself in eating and drinking; and, figuratively, of one that abounds in the good things of this world, and which make him vain and proud, and lead him on to commit sin in a bold and daring way, promising himself impunity in it, but without any just ground for it, as the following verses show; perhaps some respect may be had to Job's children feasting with one another in their prosperity, which led on to sin, and issued in their ruin, as Eliphaz would suggest. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/15.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Because he covereth his face with <span class="cverse3">{q}</span> his fatness, and maketh collops of fat on <i>his</i> flanks.</span><p>(q) That is, he was so puffed up with prosperity and abundance for all things, that he forgave God: noting that Job in his happiness did not have the true fear of God.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/job/15.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">27</span>. <span class="ital">he covereth</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">he covered;</span> and similarly, <span class="bld">he made</span> collops.

The ground and origin of the wicked man's audacity is his luxurious and intemperate living. In the days of his prosperity he pampered his body, freely indulged all his carnal appetites, and gave himself up to gluttony and gourmandism.

Most expositors translate the next line: and throughout the number of the years, which are reserved to the tyrant. But (1) this parallel definition of time appended by waw makes the sense drawling; (2) the change of &#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1509; (oppressor, tyrant) for &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; leads one to expect a fresh affirmation, hence it is translated by the lxx: &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1; &#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#837;. The predicate is, then, like <a href="//biblehub.com/job/32-7.htm">Job 32:7</a>, comp. <a href="/job/29-10.htm">Job 29:10</a>; <a href="/job/2-4.htm">Job 2:4</a> (Ges. 148), per attractionem in the plur. instead of in the sing., and especially with &#1502;&#1505;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512; followed by gen. plur.; this attraction is adopted by our author, <a href="/job/21-21.htm">Job 21:21</a>; <a href="/job/38-21.htm">Job 38:21</a>.

The thought expressed by the Targ., Syr., and Jerome would be suitable: and the number of the years (that he has to live unpunished) is hidden from the tyrant; but if this were the poet's meaning, he would have written &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493;, and must have written &#1502;&#1503;&#1470;&#1492;&#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1509;.<p>With regard to the following <a href="//biblehub.com/job/15-21.htm">Job 15:21-24</a>, it is doubtful whether only the evil-doer's anxiety of spirit is described in amplification of &#1492;&#1493;&#1488; &#1502;&#1514;&#1495;&#1493;&#1500;&#1500;, or also how the terrible images from which he suffers in his conscience are realized, and how he at length helplessly succumbs to the destruction which his imagination had long foreboded. A satisfactory and decisive answer to this question is hardly possible; but considering that the real crisis is brought on by Eliphaz later, and fully described, it seems more probable that what has an objective tone in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/15-21.htm">Job 15:21-24</a> is controlled by what has been affirmed respecting the evil conscience of the ungodly, and is to be understood accordingly. The sound of terrible things (startling dangers) rings in his ears; the devastator comes upon him (&#1489;&#1493;&#1488; seq. acc. as <a href="/job/20-22.htm">Job 20:22</a>; <a href="/proverbs/28-22.htm">Proverbs 28:22</a>; comp. <a href="/isaiah/28-15.htm">Isaiah 28:15</a>) in the midst of his prosperity. He anticipates it ere it happens. From the darkness by which he feels himself menaced, he believes not (&#1492;&#1488;&#1502;&#1497;&#1503; seq. infin. as <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/27-13.htm">Psalm 27:13</a>, &#1500;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;, of confident hope) to return; i.e., overwhelmed with a consciousness of his guilt, he cannot, in the presence of this darkness which threatens him, raise to the hope of rescue from it, and he is really - as his consciousness tells him - &#1510;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468; (like &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468;, <a href="/job/41-25.htm">Job 41:25</a>; Ges. 75, rem. 5; Keri &#1510;&#1508;&#1493;&#1497;, which is omitted in our printed copies, contrary to the testimony of the Masora and the authority of correct MSS), spied out for, appointed to the sword, i.e., of God (<a href="/job/19-29.htm">Job 19:29</a>; <a href="/isaiah/31-8.htm">Isaiah 31:8</a>), or decreed by God. In the midst of abundance he is harassed by the thought of becoming poor; he wanders about in search of bread, anxiously looking out and asking where? (abrupt, like &#1492;&#1504;&#1492;, <a href="/job/9-19.htm">Job 9:19</a>), i.e., where is any to be found, whence can I obtain it? The lxx translates contrary to the connection, and with a strange misunderstanding of the passage: &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; &#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3c8;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd; (&#1488;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; &#1500;&#1495;&#1501;, food for the vulture). He sees himself in the mirror of the future thus reduced to beggary; he knows that a day of darkness stands in readiness (&#1504;&#1499;&#1493;&#1503;, like <a href="/job/18-12.htm">Job 18:12</a>), is at his hand, i.e., close upon him (&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;, elsewhere in this sense &#1500;&#1497;&#1491;, <a href="/psalms/140-6.htm">Psalm 140:6</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-3.htm">1 Samuel 19:3</a>, and &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1497;&#1491;&#1497;, <a href="/job/1-14.htm">Job 1:14</a>).<p>In accordance with the previous exposition, we shall now interpret &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511;&#1492; &#1510;&#1512;, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/15-24.htm">Job 15:24</a>, not of need and distress, but subjectively of fear and oppression. They come upon him suddenly and irresistibly; it seizes or overpowers him (&#1514;&#1468;&#1514;&#1511;&#1508;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; with neutral subject; an unknown something, a dismal power) as a king &#1506;&#1514;&#1497;&#1491; &#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1512;. lxx &#x3c9;&#788;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1; &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;, like a leader falling in the first line of the battle, which is an imaginary interpretation of the text. The translation of the Targum also, sicut regem qui paratus est ad scabellum (to serve the conqueror as a footstool), furnishes no explanation. Another Targum translation (in Nachmani and elsewhere) is: sicut rex qui paratus est circumdare se legionibus. According to this, &#1499;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1512; comes from &#1499;&#1468;&#1491;&#1512;, to surround, be round (comp. &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1512;, whence &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1512;, Assyr. cudar, &#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, perhaps also &#1492;&#1494;&#1512;, Syr. &#1495;&#1491;&#1512;, whence chedor, a circle, round about); and it is assumed, that as &#1499;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; signifies a ball (not only in Talmudic, but also in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/22-18.htm">Isaiah 22:18</a>, which is to be translated: rolling he rolleth thee into a ball, a ball in a spacious land), so &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1512;, a round encampment, an army encamped in a circle, synon. of &#1502;&#1506;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500;. In the first signification the word certainly furnishes no suitable sense in connection with &#1506;&#1514;&#1497;&#1491;; but one may, with Kimchi, suppose that &#1499;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1512;, like the Italian torniamento, denotes the circle as well as the tournament, or the round of conflict, i.e., the conflict which moves round about, like tumult of battle, which last is a suitable meaning here. The same appropriate meaning is attained, however, if the root is taken, like the Arabic kdr, in the signification turbidum esse (comp. &#1511;&#1491;&#1512;, <a href="/job/6-16.htm">Job 6:16</a>), which is adopted of misfortunes as troubled experiences of life (according to which Schultens translates: destinatus est ad turbulentissimas fortunas, beginning a new thought with &#1506;&#1514;&#1497;&#1491;, which is not possible, since &#1499;&#1502;&#1500;&#1498; by itself is no complete figure), and may perhaps also be referred to the tumult of battle, tumultus bellici conturbatio (Rosenm.); or of, with Fleischer, one starts from another turn of the idea of the root, viz., to be compressed, solid, thick, which is a more certain way gives the meaning of a dense crowd.<p>(Note: The Arab. verb kdr belongs to the root kd, to smite, thrust, quatere, percutere, tundere, trudere; a root that has many branches. It is I. transitive cadara (fut. jacduru, inf. cadr) - by the non-adoption of which from the original lexicons our lexicographers have deprived the whole etymological development of its groundwork - in the signification to pour, hurl down, pour out, e.g., cadara-l-ma, he has spilt, poured out, thrown down the water; hence in the medial VII. form incadara intransitive, to fall, fall down, chiefly of water and other fluids, as of the rain which pours down from heaven, of a cascade, and the like; then improperly of a bird of prey which shoots down from the air upon its prey (e.g., in the poetry in Beidhwi on Sur. 81, 2: "The hawk saw some bustards on the plain f'ancadara, and rushed down"); of a hostile host which rushes upon the enemy first possible signification for &#1499;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1512;]; of a man, horse, etc., which runs very swiftly, effuse currit, effuso curru ruit; of the stars that shall fall from heaven at the last day (Sur. 81, 2). Then also II. intransitive cadara (fut. jacdiru) with the secondary form cadira (fut. jacdaru) and cadura (fut. jacduru), prop. to be shaken and jolted; then also of fluid things, mixed and mingled, made turgid, unclean, i.e., by shaking, jolting, stirring, etc., with the dregs (the cudre or cudde); then gen. turbidum, non limpidum (opp. Arab. s&#803;f'), with a similar transition of meaning to that in turbare (comp. deturbare) and the German trben (comp. traben or trappen, treiben, treffen). The primary meaning of the root takes another III. turn in the derived adjectives cudur, cudurr, cundur, cundir, compressed, solid, thick; the last word with us (Germans) forms a transition from cadir, cadr, cadr, dull, slimy, yeasty, etc., inasmuch as we speak of dickes Bier (thick beer), etc., cerevisia spissa, de la bire paisse.
