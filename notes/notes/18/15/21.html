But because many of God's people have prospered in this world, it does not therefore follow that those who are crossed and made poor, as Job, are not God's people. Eliphaz shows also that wicked people, particularly oppressors, are subject to continual terror, live very uncomfortably, and perish very miserably. Will the prosperity of presumptuous sinners end miserably as here described? Then let the mischiefs which befal others, be our warnings. Though no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous, nevertheless, afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruits of righteousness to them that are exercised thereby. No calamity, no trouble, however heavy, however severe, can rob a follower of the Lord of his favour.

He hears sudden, frightful sounds, and is alarmed. Or when he thinks himself safe, he is suddenly surprised. The enemy steals upon him, and in his fancied security he dies. This sentiment might be illustrated at almost any length by the mode of savage warfare in America, and by the sudden attacks which the American savage makes, in the silence of the night, on his unsuspecting foes. The Chaldee renders this, "the fear of the terrors in Gehenna are in his ears; when the righteous dwell in peace and eternal life, destruction comes upon him."<p>In prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him - When he supposes he is safe, and his affairs seem to be prosperous, then sudden destruction comes; see <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:3</a>. The history of wicked people, who have encompassed themselves with wealth, and as they supposed with every thing necessary to happiness, and who have been suddenly cut off, would furnish all the instances which would be necessary to illustrate this sentiment of Eliphaz. See an exquisitely beautiful illustration of it in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/37-35.htm">Psalm 37:35-36</a> :<p>I have seen the wicked in great power,<p>And spreading himself like a green bay-tree.<p>Yet he passed away, and lo he was not;<p>Yea, I sought him, but he could not be found.<p>So, also, in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/73-18.htm">Psalm 73:18-20</a> :<p>Surely thou didst set them in slippery places;<p>Thou castedst them down into destruction.<p>How are they brought into desolation as in a moment!<p>They are utterly consumed with terrors.<p>As a dream when one awaketh,<p>O Lord, when thou awakest, thou shalt despise their image. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21.

Or "a voice", or "sound of fears" (t), of what causes fears; and which are either imaginary; sometimes wicked men, fear when there is no cause or occasion for it; they fancy an enemy at their heels, and flee, when none pursues them; they are a "Magormissabib", or "terror on every side", a fear to themselves and all about them, <a href="/jeremiah/20-3.htm">Jeremiah 20:3</a>; like Cain, who fancied and feared that every man that met him would slay him <a href="/genesis/4-13.htm">Genesis 4:13</a>; such is the effect of a guilty conscience: or real; and these either extraordinary sounds, such as were made in the ears of the Syrian host, which caused them to flee, and leave their tents, and all their substance in them, <a href="/2_kings/7-6.htm">2 Kings 7:6</a>; or ordinary, as the sound of the trumpet, the alarm of war, wars and rumours which are very terrible, especially to some persons; or sounds of fears, reports of one calamity after another, which cause fears; and so may respect Job's troubles, and the dreadful sound of them in his ears, brought by one messenger of bad tidings after another: but there is a more dreadful sound than either of these, which is sometimes in the ears of wicked men; the terrors of the law of God broken by them, the menaces and curses of it, and a sound of hell and damnation, which continually rings in their ears, and fills the with horror and black despair; and so the Targum, <p>"the voice or sound of the fears in hell is in his ears;'' <p>and among the rest of his fears what follows is one, and so some connect the words, that (u). <p>in prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him; either God the lawgiver, whose law he has transgressed, and who is able, as to save his people, so to destroy the wicked, soul and body, in hell; and destruction from the Almighty, Job himself says, was a terror to him, <a href="/job/31-23.htm">Job 31:23</a>; or a destroying angel, such an one as went through the land of Egypt, and destroyed the firstborn, and into the camp of Israel, when they committed sin, and were destroyed of the destroyer; or some enemy, plunderer, and robber, such as the Sabeans and Chaldeans were, and to whom respect may be had; or even the devil himself, Apollyon, the destroyer of the souls of men, and who sometimes wicked men fear will come and carry them away, soul and body, to hell; or it may be death is meant, which kills and destroys all men; and wicked men are afraid that in the midst of all their peace and prosperity sudden destruction by death should come upon them, like a thief in the night, and remove them from all their enjoyments; and whether they are or no under any fearful apprehensions of this, it certainly will be their case. <p>(t)  "sonitus timorum", Pagninus, Montanus, Bolducius; to the same sense Codurcus, Junius &amp; Tremellius, Mercerus, Cocceius, Schmidt, Schultens.

Even "the holy ones" and "the heavens" are not. The former are, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/5-1.htm">Job 5:1</a>, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/job/4-18.htm">Job 4:18</a>, the angels as beings of light (whether &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473; signifies to be light from the very first, spotlessly pure, or, vid., Psalter, i. 588f., to be separated, distinct, and hence exalted above what is common); the latter is not another expression for the &#1488;&#1504;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497; &#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1488; (Targ.), the "angels of the heights," but &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; is the word used for the highest spheres in which they dwell (comp. <a href="/job/25-5.htm">Job 25:5</a>); for the angels are certainly not corporeal, but, like all created things, in space, and the Scriptures everywhere speak of angels and the starry heavens together. Hence the angels are called the morning stars in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/38-7.htm">Job 38:7</a>, and hence both stars and angels are called &#1510;&#1489;&#1488; &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; and &#1510;&#1489;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; (vid., Genesis. S. 128). Even the angels and the heavens are finite, and consequently are not of a nature absolutely raised above the possibility of sin and contamination.<p>Eliphaz repeats here what he has already said, <a href="/job/4-18.htm">Job 4:18</a>.; but he does it intentionally, since he wishes still more terribly to describe human uncleanness to Job (Oetinger). In that passage &#1488;&#1507; was merely the sign of an anti-climax, here &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1488;&#1507; is quanto minus. Eliphaz refers to the hereditary infirmity and sin of human nature in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/15-14.htm">Job 15:14</a>, here (<a href="/job/15-16.htm">Job 15:16</a>) to man's own free choice of that which works his destruction. He uses the strongest imaginable words to describe one actualiter and originaliter corrupted. &#1504;&#1514;&#1506;&#1489; denotes one who is become an abomination, or the abominated  equals  abominable (Ges. 134, 1); &#1504;&#1488;&#1500;&#1495;, one thoroughly corrupted (Arabic alacha, in the medial VIII conjugation: to become sour, which reminds one of &#x3b6;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;, Rabb. &#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1512; &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1505;&#1468;&#1492;, as an image of evil, and especially of evil desire). It is further said of him (an expression which Elihu adopts, <a href="/job/34-7.htm">Job 34:7</a>), that he drinks up evil like water. The figure is like <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/26-6.htm">Proverbs 26:6</a>, comp. on <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/73-10.htm">Psalm 73:10</a>, and implies that he lusts after sin, and that it is become a necessity of his nature, and is to his nature what water is to the thirsty. Even Job does not deny this corruption of man (<a href="/job/14-4.htm">Job 14:4</a>), but the inferences which the friends draw in reference to him he cannot acknowledge. The continuation of Eliphaz' speech shows how they render this acknowledgment impossible to him. </body></html>
