But because many of God's people have prospered in this world, it does not therefore follow that those who are crossed and made poor, as Job, are not God's people. Eliphaz shows also that wicked people, particularly oppressors, are subject to continual terror, live very uncomfortably, and perish very miserably. Will the prosperity of presumptuous sinners end miserably as here described? Then let the mischiefs which befal others, be our warnings. Though no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous, nevertheless, afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruits of righteousness to them that are exercised thereby. No calamity, no trouble, however heavy, however severe, can rob a follower of the Lord of his favour.

He shall not be able to rise again, but shall be continually poor.<p>The flame shall dry up his branches - As the fire consumes the green branches of a tree, so shall punishment do to him. This comparison is very forcible, and the idea is, that the man who has been prospered as a tree shall be consumed - as the fire consumes a tree when it passes through the branches. The comparison of a prosperous man with a tree is very common, and very beautiful. Thus, the Psalmist says,<p>I have seen the wicked in great power,<p>And spreading himself like a green bay tree. <a href="/psalms/37-35.htm">Psalm 37:35</a>.<p>Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/92-12.htm">Psalm 92:12-13</a>.

My branches are falling," etc.<p>And by the breath of his mouth shall he go away - That is, by the breath of the mouth of God. God is not indeed specified, but it is not unusual to speak of him in this manner. The image here seems to be that of the destruction of a man by a burning wind or by lightning. As a tree is dried up, or is rent by lightning, or is torn up from the roots by a tempest sent by the Deity, so the wicked will be destroyed. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>30. depart&#8212;that is, escape (Job 15:22, 23).<p>branches&#8212;namely, his offspring (Job 1:18, 19; Ps 37:35).<p>dry up&#8212;The "flame" is the sultry wind in the East by which plants most full of sap are suddenly shrivelled.<p>his mouth&#8212;that is, God's wrath (Isa 11:4).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/job/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">He shall not depart out of darkness; </span> his misery shall have no end. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The flame; </span> God’s anger and judgment upon him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">His branches; </span> either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

Most expositors translate the next line: and throughout the number of the years, which are reserved to the tyrant. But (1) this parallel definition of time appended by waw makes the sense drawling; (2) the change of &#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1509; (oppressor, tyrant) for &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; leads one to expect a fresh affirmation, hence it is translated by the lxx: &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1; &#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#837;. The predicate is, then, like <a href="//biblehub.com/job/32-7.htm">Job 32:7</a>, comp. <a href="/job/29-10.htm">Job 29:10</a>; <a href="/job/2-4.htm">Job 2:4</a> (Ges. 148), per attractionem in the plur. instead of in the sing., and especially with &#1502;&#1505;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512; followed by gen. plur.; this attraction is adopted by our author, <a href="/job/21-21.htm">Job 21:21</a>; <a href="/job/38-21.htm">Job 38:21</a>.

The thought expressed by the Targ., Syr., and Jerome would be suitable: and the number of the years (that he has to live unpunished) is hidden from the tyrant; but if this were the poet's meaning, he would have written &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493;, and must have written &#1502;&#1503;&#1470;&#1492;&#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1509;.<p>With regard to the following <a href="//biblehub.com/job/15-21.htm">Job 15:21-24</a>, it is doubtful whether only the evil-doer's anxiety of spirit is described in amplification of &#1492;&#1493;&#1488; &#1502;&#1514;&#1495;&#1493;&#1500;&#1500;, or also how the terrible images from which he suffers in his conscience are realized, and how he at length helplessly succumbs to the destruction which his imagination had long foreboded. A satisfactory and decisive answer to this question is hardly possible; but considering that the real crisis is brought on by Eliphaz later, and fully described, it seems more probable that what has an objective tone in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/15-21.htm">Job 15:21-24</a> is controlled by what has been affirmed respecting the evil conscience of the ungodly, and is to be understood accordingly. The sound of terrible things (startling dangers) rings in his ears; the devastator comes upon him (&#1489;&#1493;&#1488; seq. acc. as <a href="/job/20-22.htm">Job 20:22</a>; <a href="/proverbs/28-22.htm">Proverbs 28:22</a>; comp. <a href="/isaiah/28-15.htm">Isaiah 28:15</a>) in the midst of his prosperity. He anticipates it ere it happens. From the darkness by which he feels himself menaced, he believes not (&#1492;&#1488;&#1502;&#1497;&#1503; seq. infin. as <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/27-13.htm">Psalm 27:13</a>, &#1500;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;, of confident hope) to return; i.e., overwhelmed with a consciousness of his guilt, he cannot, in the presence of this darkness which threatens him, raise to the hope of rescue from it, and he is really - as his consciousness tells him - &#1510;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468; (like &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468;, <a href="/job/41-25.htm">Job 41:25</a>; Ges. 75, rem. 5; Keri &#1510;&#1508;&#1493;&#1497;, which is omitted in our printed copies, contrary to the testimony of the Masora and the authority of correct MSS), spied out for, appointed to the sword, i.e., of God (<a href="/job/19-29.htm">Job 19:29</a>; <a href="/isaiah/31-8.htm">Isaiah 31:8</a>), or decreed by God. In the midst of abundance he is harassed by the thought of becoming poor; he wanders about in search of bread, anxiously looking out and asking where? (abrupt, like &#1492;&#1504;&#1492;, <a href="/job/9-19.htm">Job 9:19</a>), i.e., where is any to be found, whence can I obtain it? The lxx translates contrary to the connection, and with a strange misunderstanding of the passage: &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; &#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3c8;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd; (&#1488;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; &#1500;&#1495;&#1501;, food for the vulture). He sees himself in the mirror of the future thus reduced to beggary; he knows that a day of darkness stands in readiness (&#1504;&#1499;&#1493;&#1503;, like <a href="/job/18-12.htm">Job 18:12</a>), is at his hand, i.e., close upon him (&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;, elsewhere in this sense &#1500;&#1497;&#1491;, <a href="/psalms/140-6.htm">Psalm 140:6</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-3.htm">1 Samuel 19:3</a>, and &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1497;&#1491;&#1497;, <a href="/job/1-14.htm">Job 1:14</a>).<p>In accordance with the previous exposition, we shall now interpret &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511;&#1492; &#1510;&#1512;, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/15-24.htm">Job 15:24</a>, not of need and distress, but subjectively of fear and oppression.

In the first signification the word certainly furnishes no suitable sense in connection with &#1506;&#1514;&#1497;&#1491;; but one may, with Kimchi, suppose that &#1499;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1512;, like the Italian torniamento, denotes the circle as well as the tournament, or the round of conflict, i.e., the conflict which moves round about, like tumult of battle, which last is a suitable meaning here. The same appropriate meaning is attained, however, if the root is taken, like the Arabic kdr, in the signification turbidum esse (comp. &#1511;&#1491;&#1512;, <a href="/job/6-16.htm">Job 6:16</a>), which is adopted of misfortunes as troubled experiences of life (according to which Schultens translates: destinatus est ad turbulentissimas fortunas, beginning a new thought with &#1506;&#1514;&#1497;&#1491;, which is not possible, since &#1499;&#1502;&#1500;&#1498; by itself is no complete figure), and may perhaps also be referred to the tumult of battle, tumultus bellici conturbatio (Rosenm.); or of, with Fleischer, one starts from another turn of the idea of the root, viz., to be compressed, solid, thick, which is a more certain way gives the meaning of a dense crowd.<p>(Note: The Arab. verb kdr belongs to the root kd, to smite, thrust, quatere, percutere, tundere, trudere; a root that has many branches. It is I. transitive cadara (fut. jacduru, inf. cadr) - by the non-adoption of which from the original lexicons our lexicographers have deprived the whole etymological development of its groundwork - in the signification to pour, hurl down, pour out, e.g., cadara-l-ma, he has spilt, poured out, thrown down the water; hence in the medial VII. form incadara intransitive, to fall, fall down, chiefly of water and other fluids, as of the rain which pours down from heaven, of a cascade, and the like; then improperly of a bird of prey which shoots down from the air upon its prey (e.g., in the poetry in Beidhwi on Sur. 81, 2: "The hawk saw some bustards on the plain f'ancadara, and rushed down"); of a hostile host which rushes upon the enemy first possible signification for &#1499;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1512;]; of a man, horse, etc., which runs very swiftly, effuse currit, effuso curru ruit; of the stars that shall fall from heaven at the last day (Sur. 81, 2). Then also II. intransitive cadara (fut. jacdiru) with the secondary form cadira (fut. jacdaru) and cadura (fut. jacduru), prop. to be shaken and jolted; then also of fluid things, mixed and mingled, made turgid, unclean, i.e., by shaking, jolting, stirring, etc., with the dregs (the cudre or cudde); then gen. turbidum, non limpidum (opp. Arab. s&#803;f'), with a similar transition of meaning to that in turbare (comp. deturbare) and the German trben (comp. traben or trappen, treiben, treffen). The primary meaning of the root takes another III. turn in the derived adjectives cudur, cudurr, cundur, cundir, compressed, solid, thick; the last word with us (Germans) forms a transition from cadir, cadr, cadr, dull, slimy, yeasty, etc., inasmuch as we speak of dickes Bier (thick beer), etc., cerevisia spissa, de la bire paisse. Here the point of contact of the word &#1499;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1512;, tumult of battle, &#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;, seems indicated: a dense crowd and tumult, where one is close upon another; as also &#1504;&#1500;&#1495;&#1501;, &#1502;&#1500;&#1495;&#1502;&#1492;, signify not reciprocal destruction, slaughter, but to press firmly and closely upon one another, a dense crowd. - Fl.)<p>continued...</body></html>
