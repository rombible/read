In it the speaker only repeats the orthodox and familiar saw that the wicked are punished in life, and therefore, by implication, the good rewarded: a maxim which fails utterly in the face of afflictions like those of Job, unless, as his friends insinuated, he was one of the wicked. After stating the doom of the ungodly, Eliphaz, in the last verse, sums up the character of those he has been denouncing. Not only are they evil in themselves, but they hatch evil; but it is evil that recoils on themselves.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/job/15.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/job/15-32.htm" title="It shall be accomplished before his time, and his branch shall not be green....">Job 15:32-33</a></span>. <span class="ital">It shall be accomplished — </span>Namely, that which was last mentioned, that <span class="ital">vanity should be his recompense: before his time — </span>When, by the course of nature, and common providence, he might have continued and flourished much longer. <span class="ital">And his branch — </span>His glory and prosperity, or his children; <span class="ital">shall not be green — </span>Shall not continue to flourish as heretofore. <span class="ital">He shall shake off his unripe grapes </span>— The wicked man, who, by his sins, is the author of his own ruin, shall be deprived of his fruit, of his children, and other comforts, before their time; <span class="ital">as the vine — </span>Which either of itself drops its tender grapes, or loses them when they are plucked off by a violent hand; <span class="ital">and shall cast off his flower as the olive —</span> Which flourishes much about the same time with the vine, and commonly suffers similar injuries.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/job/15.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>15:17-35 Eliphaz maintains that the wicked are certainly miserable: whence he would infer, that the miserable are certainly wicked, and therefore Job was so. But because many of God's people have prospered in this world, it does not therefore follow that those who are crossed and made poor, as Job, are not God's people. Eliphaz shows also that wicked people, particularly oppressors, are subject to continual terror, live very uncomfortably, and perish very miserably. Will the prosperity of presumptuous sinners end miserably as here described? Then let the mischiefs which befal others, be our warnings. Though no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous, nevertheless, afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruits of righteousness to them that are exercised thereby. No calamity, no trouble, however heavy, however severe, can rob a follower of the Lord of his favour. What shall separate him from the love of Christ?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>It shall be accomplished before his time - Margin, "cut off." The image here is that of a tree, which had been suggested in <a href="/job/15-30.htm">Job 15:30</a>. Here it is followed up by various illustrations drawn from the flower, the fruit, etc., all of which are designed to denote the same thing - that a wicked man will not be permanently prosperous; he will not live and flourish as he would if he were righteous. He will be like a tree that is cut down before its proper time, or that casts its flowers and fruits and brings nothing to perfection. The phrase here literally is, "It shall not be filled up in its time;" that is, a wicked man will be cut off before he has filled up the measure of his days, like a tree that decays and falls before its proper time. A similar idea occurs in <a href="/psalms/55-23.htm">Psalm 55:23</a>. "Bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days." As a general fact this is all true, and the observation of the ancient Idumeans was correct. The temperate live longer than the intemperate; the chaste longer than the licentious; he that controls and governs his passions longer than he who gives the reins to them; and he who leads a life of honesty and virtue longer than he who lives for crime. Pure religion makes a man temperate, sober, chaste, calm, dispassionate, and equable in his temper; saves from broils, contentions, and strifes; subdues the angry passions, and thus tends to lengthen out life.<p>His branch shall not be green - It shall be dried up and withered away - retaining the image of a tree. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>32.
