He unjustly charges Job with casting off the fear of God, and all regard to him, and restraining prayer. See in what religion is summed up, fearing God, and praying to him; the former the most needful principle, the latter the most needful practice. Eliphaz charges Job with self-conceit. He charges him with contempt of the counsels and comforts given him by his friends. We are apt to think that which we ourselves say is important, when others, with reason, think little of it. He charges him with opposition to God. Eliphaz ought not to have put harsh constructions upon the words of one well known for piety, and now in temptation. It is plain that these disputants were deeply convinced of the doctrine of original sin, and the total depravity of human nature. Shall we not admire the patience of God in bearing with us? and still more his love to us in the redemption of Christ Jesus his beloved Son?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Art thou the first man that was born? - Hast thou lived ever since the creation, and treasured up all the wisdom of past times, that thou dost now speak so arrogantly and confidently? This question was asked, because, in the estimation of Eliphaz and his friends, wisdom was supposed to be connected with long life, and with an opportunity for extended and varied observation; see <a href="/job/15-10.htm">Job 15:10</a>. Job they regarded as comparatively a young man.<p>Wast thou made before the hills - The mountains and the hills are often represented as being the oldest of created objects, probably because they are the most ancient things that appear on earth. Springs dry up, and waters change their beds; cities are built and decay; kingdoms rise and fall, and all the monuments of human skill and art perish; but the hills and mountains remain the same from age to age. Thus, in <a href="/psalms/90-2.htm">Psalm 90:2</a> :<p>Before the mountains were brought forth,<p>Or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world,<p>Even from everlasting to everlasting thou art God.<p>So in <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/8-25.htm">Proverbs 8:25</a>, in the description of wisdom:<p>Before the mountains were settled,<p>Before the hills was I brought forth.<p>So the hills are called "everlasting" <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/49-26.htm">Genesis 49:26</a>, in allusion to their great antiquity and permanence. And so we, in common parlance, have a similar expression when we say of anything that "it is as old as the hills." The question which Eliphaz intends to ask here of Job is, whether he had lived from the creation, and had observed everything? <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7.

The first Adam, who was created in wisdom and knowledge, and had a large share of understanding in things natural, civil, and moral; knew much of God and his perfections, of the works of nature, and of the wisdom and power of God displayed in them; one instance of which is his giving names to the creatures; dost thou think thou art that selfsame individual person, the father of all mankind, who had such a stock and fund of knowledge, until, by seeking after more, and that unlawful, he lost much of what he had? dost thou imagine that thou hast lived ever since, and seen or known everything that was done in all ages from the beginning, and hast gathered a large share of knowledge from long experience, and by making strict observations on men and things in such a length of time? or, as the Targum, <p>"wast thou born with the first man, without father and mother?'' <p>and hast thou existed ever since? or, "wast thou born before Adam?" before the first man (z)? Art thou the wisdom and son of God, who was before Abraham, before Adam, before any creature whatever, was in the beginning with God, and was God? What dost thou make thyself to be, Job? thou, a mere man, dost thou make thyself to be the eternal God? for to be before the first man, or to be the firstborn of every creature, or to be born before every creature, is expressive of eternity, as is the following phrase: <p>or wast thou made before the hills? or existed before they did? as is said of the son of God, <a href="/proverbs/8-25.htm">Proverbs 8:25</a>; what is before the hills and mountains is eternal; the eternal God and his eternity are thus described, <a href="/psalms/90-2.htm">Psalm 90:2</a>. <p>(z) So Mercerus, and some in Vatablus, Schmidt, Jarchi, &amp; Bar Tzemach. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/15.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><i>Art</i> thou the <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> first man <i>that</i> was born? or wast thou made before the hills?</span><p>(e) That is, the most ancient and so by reason the most wise?</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/job/15.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">7</span>. <span class="ital">Art thou the first man</span>] lit. <span class="ital">wast thou born a man first</span>? The first man that came from God’s hand would naturally be endowed with preeminent wisdom and other attributes. Schlottmann (p. 303) quotes an ironical proverb current in India, “Yes, yes, he is the first man, no wonder that he is so wise.” The second clause, of the verse, however, as well as <span class="ital"><a href="/job/15-8.htm" title="Have you heard the secret of God? and do you restrain wisdom to yourself?">Job 15:8</a></span>, seems to express the conception of a Being formed before the earth, either the Wisdom of <a href="/proverbs/8-22.htm" title="The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old.">Proverbs 8:22</a> <span class="ital">seq</span>., or a Being similar, cf. especially <a href="/proverbs/8-25.htm" title="Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought forth:">Proverbs 8:25</a>; and the query of Eliphaz is, Art thou the very Wisdom of God? or, Art thou such a Being as the wisdom of God?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">7–11</span>. But coming back to Job’s assumption of superior wisdom, Eliphaz must ask on what it rests?<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Art thou the first man that was born?</span> That is, "Dost thou claim to have the wisdom of that first human intelligence, which, proceeding direct from God (<a href="/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>), was without fault or flaw - a perfect intelligence, which judged all things aright?" It is not clear that Eliphaz had ever heard of Adam; but he evidently believed in a "first man," from whom all others were descended, and he attributed to this first man a mind and intellect surpassing those of all other men. His question is, of course, rather a scoff than an inquiry. He knows that Job makes no such foolish pretence; but he throws it in his teeth that, from what he has said, men might suppose he took some such view of himself. <span class="cmt_word">Or wast thou made before the hills?</span> This is a taunt of the same kind as the previous one, but intensified. Wisdom is the result of experience. Art thou older than all the rest of us - older than the earth itself, than "the everlasting hills"? There were Greeks who claimed to be ethnically <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, "older than the moon," but no inhabitant of earth was ever so foolish as to imagine himself individually more ancient than the earth on which he lived. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>  1  Then began Eliphaz the Temanite, and said:<p>  2  Doth a wise man utter vain knowledge,<p>And fill his breast with the east wind?<p>  3  Contending with words, that profit not,<p>And speeches, by which no good is done?<p>  4  Moreover, thou makest void the fear of God,<p>And thou restrainest devotion before God;<p>  5  For thy mouth exposeth thy misdeeds,<p>And thou choosest the language of the crafty.<p>  6  Thine own mouth condemneth thee and not I,<p>And thine own lips testify against thee.<p>The second course of the controversy is again opened by Eliphaz, the most respectable, most influential, and perhaps oldest of the friends. Job's detailed and bitter answers seem to him as empty words and impassioned tirades, which ill become a wise man, such as he claims to be in assertions like <a href="/job/12-3.htm">Job 12:3</a>; <a href="/job/13-2.htm">Job 13:2</a>. &#1492;&#1495;&#1500;&#1501; with He interr., like &#1492;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492;, <a href="/job/13-25.htm">Job 13:25</a>. &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;, wind, is the opposite of what is solid and sure; and &#1511;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; in the parallel (like <a href="/hosea/12-2.htm">Hosea 12:2</a>) signifies what is worthless, with the additional notion of vehement action. If we translate &#1489;&#1468;&#1496;&#1503; by "belly," the meaning is apt to be misunderstood; it is not intended as the opposite of &#1500;&#1489; fo et (Ewald), but it means, especially in the book of Job, not only that which feels, but also thinks and wills, the spiritually receptive and active inner nature of man (Psychol. S. 266); as also in Arabic, el-battin signifies that which is within, in the deepest mystical sense. Hirz. and Renan translate the inf. abs. &#1492;&#1493;&#1499;&#1495;, which follows in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/15-3.htm">Job 15:3</a>, as verb. fin.: se dfend-il par des vaines paroles; but though the inf. abs. is so used in an historical clause (<a href="/job/15-35.htm">Job 15:35</a>), it is not an interrogative. Ewald takes it as the subject: "to reprove with words-avails not, and speeches - whereby one does no good;" but though &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; and &#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; might be used without any further defining, as in &#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd; (<a href="/2_timothy/2-14.htm">2 Timothy 2:14</a>) and &#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; (<a href="/1_timothy/6-4.htm">1 Timothy 6:4</a>), the form of <a href="/job/15-3.htm">Job 15:3</a> is opposed to such an explanation. The inf. abs. is connected as a gerund (redarguendo s. disputando) with the verbs in the question, <a href="/job/15-2.htm">Job 15:2</a>; and the elliptical relative clause &#1497;&#1505;&#1499;&#1468;&#1503; &#1500;&#1488; is best, as referring to things, according to <a href="/job/35-3.htm">Job 35:3</a> : sermone (&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1491; from &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;, as sermo from serere) qui non prodest; &#1489;&#1468;&#1501; &#1497;&#1493;&#1506;&#1497;&#1500; &#1500;&#1488;, on the other hand, to persons, verbis quibus nil utilitatis affert. Eliphaz does not censure Job for arguing, but for defending himself by such useless and purposeless utterances of his feeling. But still more than that: his speeches are not only unsatisfactory and unbecoming, &#1488;&#1507;, accedit quod (cumulative like <a href="/job/14-3.htm">Job 14:3</a>), they are moreover irreligious, since by doubting the justice of God they deprive religion of its fundamental assumption, and diminish the reverence due to God. &#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; in such an objective sense as <a href="/psalms/19-10.htm">Psalm 19:10</a> almost corresponds to the idea of religion. &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1495;&#1492; &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1470;&#1488;&#1500; is to be understood, according to <a href="/psalms/102-1.htm">Psalm 102:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/142-3.htm">Psalm 142:3</a> (comp. <a href="/psalms/64-2.htm">Psalm 64:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/104-34.htm">Psalm 104:34</a>): before God, and consequently customary devotional meditation, here of the disposition of mind indispensable to prayer, viz., devotion, and especially reverential awe, which Job depreciates (&#1490;&#1468;&#1512;&#1506;, detrahere). His speeches are mostly directed towards God; but they are violent and reproachful, therefore irreverent in form and substance.</body></html>
