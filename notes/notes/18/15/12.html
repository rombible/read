He thought Job’s spirit was soured against God, and exasperated at his dealings with him, and so was turned from what it had been: and that this was evident from his letting such words go out of his mouth as reflected on God, and his justice and goodness. But Eliphaz wanted candour and charity, otherwise he would not have put such a harsh construction on the speeches of one that had such a settled reputation for piety, and was now sorely assaulted with temptation. This was, in effect, to give the cause on Satan’s side, and to own that Job had done as Satan said he would, <span class="ital">curse God to his face.</span><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/job/15.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>15:1-16 Eliphaz begins a second attack upon Job, instead of being softened by his complaints. He unjustly charges Job with casting off the fear of God, and all regard to him, and restraining prayer. See in what religion is summed up, fearing God, and praying to him; the former the most needful principle, the latter the most needful practice. Eliphaz charges Job with self-conceit. He charges him with contempt of the counsels and comforts given him by his friends. We are apt to think that which we ourselves say is important, when others, with reason, think little of it. He charges him with opposition to God. Eliphaz ought not to have put harsh constructions upon the words of one well known for piety, and now in temptation. It is plain that these disputants were deeply convinced of the doctrine of original sin, and the total depravity of human nature. Shall we not admire the patience of God in bearing with us? and still more his love to us in the redemption of Christ Jesus his beloved Son?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Why doth thine heart carry thee away? - Why do you allow your feelings to control you in spite of the decisions of the understanding? Eliphaz means to represent him as wholly under the influence of passion, instead of looking calmly and cooly at things as they were, and listening to the results of past experience and observation.<p>And what do thy eyes wink at - This expression has given considerable perplexity to commentators. Rosenmuller (and after him Noyes) remarks that the expression indicates pride, haughtiness, and arrogance. In <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/35-19.htm">Psalm 35:19</a>, it is an indication of joyfulness or triumph over a prostrate foe:<p>Let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over me;<p>Neither let them wink with the eye that hate me without a cause.<p>In <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/6-13.htm">Proverbs 6:13</a>, it is an indication of a haughty, froward, self-confident person:<p>A haughty person, a wicked man,<p>Walketh with a froward mouth;<p>He winketh with his eyes,<p>He speaketh with his feet,<p>He teacheth with his fingers.<p>The Hebrew word (&#1512;&#1494;&#1501;  ra&#770;zam) occurs nowhere else, and it is therefore difficult to determine its true signification. The most probable meaning is, to wink with the eyes as a gesture of pride and insolence; compare the notes at <a href="/isaiah/3-16.htm">Isaiah 3:16</a>. The Vulgate renders it, attonitos habes oculos? - "Why, as though meditating great things, hast thou eyes of astonishment?" Septuagint, "Why are thine eyes elevated?" Schultens renders it, "Why do thine eyes roll fury?" - Quid fremitum volvunt oculi tui? Luther, "Why art thou so proud? There can be no reasonable doubt that the word conveys the idea of pride and haughtiness manifested in some way by the eyes. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. wink&#8212;that is, why do thy eyes evince pride?

To such conceit of thyself, and contempt of others, and even to slight the consolations of God; the heart, being deceitful and wicked, sometimes carries away good men to say and do those things which are unbecoming; and if, in any instance, this was Job's case, it was owing to his own heart, which carried him beyond due bounds; for whenever any man is "tempted" to do evil, "he is drawn away of his own lust", and enticed, <a href="/james/1-14.htm">James 1:14</a>; <p>and what do thine eyes wink at; conniving at and shutting his eyes against his own sins and iniquities, unwilling to see them, and be convinced of them, and own them; or shutting them against the charges and reproofs of his friends, and all the light and evidence with which they came; or rather as carelessly attending to them, and scoffing and sneering at them: some render it, "what do thine eyes aim at" (c)? as men, when they take an aim at a mark, wink with or shut one eye; what are thy designs? what hast thou in view? what wouldest thou be at, talking and behaving in such a manner as thou dost? <p>(c) "collimant", Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator, Cocceius; so Broughton. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/15.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Why doth thine heart <span class="cverse3">{h}</span> carry thee away? and what do thy eyes wink at,</span><p>(h) Why do you stand in your own conceit?</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/job/15.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">12</span>. <span class="ital">what do thine eyes wink at</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">wherefore do thine eyes wink</span>? i. e., flash or roll, sign of violent passion.

This opinion respecting him, which is so sharply and definitely expressed by &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;, thrusts itself irresistibly forward, for it is not necessary to know his life more exactly, his own mouth, whence such words escape, reveals his sad state: docet (&#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1507; only in the book of Job, from &#1488;&#1500;&#1507;, discere, a word which only occurs once in the Hebrew, <a href="/proverbs/22-25.htm">Proverbs 22:25</a>) culpam tuam os tuum, not as Schlottm. explains, with Raschi: docet culpa tua os tuum, which, to avoid being misunderstood, must have been &#1495;&#1496;&#1488;&#1514;&#1498; &#1514;&#1488;&#1500;&#1507;, and is a though unsuited to the connection. &#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1507; is certainly not directly equivalent to &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491;, <a href="/isaiah/3-9.htm">Isaiah 3:9</a>; it signifies to teach, to explain, and this verb is just the one in the mouth of the censorious friend.

Thus by his evil words he becomes his own judge (&#1497;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1506;&#1498;) and accuser (&#1497;&#1506;&#1504;&#1493; &#1489;&#1498; after the fem. &#1513;&#1474;&#1508;&#1514;&#1497;&#1498;, like <a href="/proverbs/5-2.htm">Proverbs 5:2</a>; <a href="/proverbs/26-23.htm">Proverbs 26:23</a>). The knot of the controversy becomes constantly more entangled since Job strengthens the friends more and more in their false view by his speeches, which certainly are sinful in some parts (as <a href="/job/9-22.htm">Job 9:22</a>). </body></html>
