He unjustly charges Job with casting off the fear of God, and all regard to him, and restraining prayer. See in what religion is summed up, fearing God, and praying to him; the former the most needful principle, the latter the most needful practice. Eliphaz charges Job with self-conceit. He charges him with contempt of the counsels and comforts given him by his friends. We are apt to think that which we ourselves say is important, when others, with reason, think little of it. He charges him with opposition to God. Eliphaz ought not to have put harsh constructions upon the words of one well known for piety, and now in temptation. It is plain that these disputants were deeply convinced of the doctrine of original sin, and the total depravity of human nature. Shall we not admire the patience of God in bearing with us? and still more his love to us in the redemption of Christ Jesus his beloved Son?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>With us are both the gray headed - That is, some of us who are here are much older than thy father; or we express the sentiments of such aged men. Job had admitted <a href="//biblehub.com/job/12-12.htm">Job 12:12</a>, that with the aged was wisdom, and in length of days understanding; and Eliphaz here urges that on that principle he and his friends had a claim to be heard. It would seem from this, that Job was very far from being regarded as an old man, and would probably be esteemed as in middle life. The Targum (Chaldee) refers this to Eliphaz himself and his two friends. "Truly Eliphaz, who is hoary-headed (&#1491;&#1505;&#1497;&#1489;) and Bildad, the long-lived (&#1491;&#1511;&#1513;&#1497;&#1513;) are with us, and Zophar, who is older than thy father." But it is not certain that he meant to confine the remark to them. It seems to me probable that this whole discussion occurred in the presence of others, and perhaps was a public contest. It is clear, I think, that Elihu was present, and heard it all (see <a href="/job/32-4.htm">Job 32:4</a>), and it would accord well with Oriental habits to suppose that this was a trim of skill, which many were permitted to witness, and which was continued for a considerable time. Eliphaz may, therefore, have meant to say that among his friends who had assembled to hear this debate, there were not a few who coincided with him in sentiment, who were much more aged than Job, and who had had much longer experience in the world. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. On our side, thinking with us are the aged. Job had admitted that wisdom is with them (Job 12:12). Eliphaz seems to have been himself older than Job; perhaps the other two were also (Job 32:6). Job, in Job 30:1, does not refer to his three friends; it therefore forms no objection. The Arabs are proud of fulness of years.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/job/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">With us, </span> i.e. among us; either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

The grayheaded man, or one that is so, it is in the singular number; gray hairs are a sign of old age, and an emblem of wisdom, see <a href="/job/12-12.htm">Job 12:12</a>; to which words Eliphaz may be thought to refer; Job there suggesting as if wisdom was with him, being an ancient man: <p>and very aged men; or "man" rather; Mr. Broughton renders it, and "all gray", as if the other word only signifies one that has a mixture of gray hairs on him, but this one all whose hairs are turned gray: <p>much elder than thy father; or "greater", as the same learned man renders it; and so Aben Ezra and Bar Tzemach say in the Arabic language the word signifies, and may design a third person. Ben Gersom thinks that Eliphaz was older than Job, and that his other two friends were younger than he, or Zophar only was younger than he; one of the Targums paraphrases the words thus, <p>"but Eliphaz who is gray, and Bildad who is aged, are with us, and Zophar who is greater in days than thy father;'' <p>it appears that they were very old men by what Elihu says, <a href="/job/32-6.htm">Job 32:6</a>; though it may be Eliphaz may not barely have respect to themselves and their age, but to their ancestors, their fathers, from whom they had their knowledge, when they were but of yesterday, and knew little, and so pleads antiquity on their side; and it has been observed that Teman, from whence Eliphaz was, was famous for wisdom, and wise men in it, at least it was so in later times; and if so early, the observation would be more pertinent, and the sense might be thought to be, that we have at Teman men as ancient and as wise as at Uz, in the schools of the one as in the schools of the other, and so have the opportunity of gaining as much wisdom and knowledge as Job: or it may be the meaning only is this, that we have on our side the question as many ancient and learned men, or more, than Job can pretend to; and thus, as before, antiquity is pleaded; but is not a sure rule to go by, at least by trusting to it men may be led aside; for though truth is the good old way, and is the oldest way, yet error is almost as old as truth; it follows so close upon the heels of it, that it is difficult, in some cases, to discern which is first, though truth always is: there is the old way which wicked men have trodden; and a pretence to antiquity, if not carefully observed, may lead into it, see <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-16.htm">Jeremiah 6:16</a>, <a href="/job/22-15.htm">Job 22:15</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/15.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">With us are both the grayheaded and very aged men, much elder than thy father.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/job/15.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">10</span>. This verse should probably read,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Among us is one both grayheaded and very aged,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>One older in days than thy father.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Eliphaz with a dignified indirectness in which, however, a certain personal feeling is displayed, alludes to himself. Others take the words “grayheaded” and “very aged” as collectives—among us are both the grayheaded and the very aged; in which case “among us” must mean “belonging to our tribes.” But in reproving Job’s demeanour a reference to persons absent seems out of place.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">With us are both the greyheaded and very aged men</span>. "With us" seems to mean "of our party," or "on our side." Eliphaz claims that all the greybeards of the time, as well as all the ancient men of past times (comp. <a href="/job/8-8.htm">Job 8:8</a>, and below, ver. 18), are on his side. and think as he does. <span class="cmt_word">Much elder than thy father</span>.

Job's detailed and bitter answers seem to him as empty words and impassioned tirades, which ill become a wise man, such as he claims to be in assertions like <a href="/job/12-3.htm">Job 12:3</a>; <a href="/job/13-2.htm">Job 13:2</a>. &#1492;&#1495;&#1500;&#1501; with He interr., like &#1492;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492;, <a href="/job/13-25.htm">Job 13:25</a>. &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;, wind, is the opposite of what is solid and sure; and &#1511;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; in the parallel (like <a href="/hosea/12-2.htm">Hosea 12:2</a>) signifies what is worthless, with the additional notion of vehement action. If we translate &#1489;&#1468;&#1496;&#1503; by "belly," the meaning is apt to be misunderstood; it is not intended as the opposite of &#1500;&#1489; fo et (Ewald), but it means, especially in the book of Job, not only that which feels, but also thinks and wills, the spiritually receptive and active inner nature of man (Psychol. S. 266); as also in Arabic, el-battin signifies that which is within, in the deepest mystical sense. Hirz. and Renan translate the inf. abs. &#1492;&#1493;&#1499;&#1495;, which follows in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/15-3.htm">Job 15:3</a>, as verb. fin.: se dfend-il par des vaines paroles; but though the inf. abs. is so used in an historical clause (<a href="/job/15-35.htm">Job 15:35</a>), it is not an interrogative. Ewald takes it as the subject: "to reprove with words-avails not, and speeches - whereby one does no good;" but though &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; and &#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; might be used without any further defining, as in &#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd; (<a href="/2_timothy/2-14.htm">2 Timothy 2:14</a>) and &#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; (<a href="/1_timothy/6-4.htm">1 Timothy 6:4</a>), the form of <a href="/job/15-3.htm">Job 15:3</a> is opposed to such an explanation. The inf. abs. is connected as a gerund (redarguendo s. disputando) with the verbs in the question, <a href="/job/15-2.htm">Job 15:2</a>; and the elliptical relative clause &#1497;&#1505;&#1499;&#1468;&#1503; &#1500;&#1488; is best, as referring to things, according to <a href="/job/35-3.htm">Job 35:3</a> : sermone (&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1491; from &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;, as sermo from serere) qui non prodest; &#1489;&#1468;&#1501; &#1497;&#1493;&#1506;&#1497;&#1500; &#1500;&#1488;, on the other hand, to persons, verbis quibus nil utilitatis affert. Eliphaz does not censure Job for arguing, but for defending himself by such useless and purposeless utterances of his feeling. But still more than that: his speeches are not only unsatisfactory and unbecoming, &#1488;&#1507;, accedit quod (cumulative like <a href="/job/14-3.htm">Job 14:3</a>), they are moreover irreligious, since by doubting the justice of God they deprive religion of its fundamental assumption, and diminish the reverence due to God. &#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; in such an objective sense as <a href="/psalms/19-10.htm">Psalm 19:10</a> almost corresponds to the idea of religion. &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1495;&#1492; &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1470;&#1488;&#1500; is to be understood, according to <a href="/psalms/102-1.htm">Psalm 102:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/142-3.htm">Psalm 142:3</a> (comp. <a href="/psalms/64-2.htm">Psalm 64:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/104-34.htm">Psalm 104:34</a>): before God, and consequently customary devotional meditation, here of the disposition of mind indispensable to prayer, viz., devotion, and especially reverential awe, which Job depreciates (&#1490;&#1468;&#1512;&#1506;, detrahere). His speeches are mostly directed towards God; but they are violent and reproachful, therefore irreverent in form and substance.</body></html>
