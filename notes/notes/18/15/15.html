He unjustly charges Job with casting off the fear of God, and all regard to him, and restraining prayer. See in what religion is summed up, fearing God, and praying to him; the former the most needful principle, the latter the most needful practice. Eliphaz charges Job with self-conceit. He charges him with contempt of the counsels and comforts given him by his friends. We are apt to think that which we ourselves say is important, when others, with reason, think little of it. He charges him with opposition to God. Eliphaz ought not to have put harsh constructions upon the words of one well known for piety, and now in temptation. It is plain that these disputants were deeply convinced of the doctrine of original sin, and the total depravity of human nature.

The general idea is the same. God is so holy that all things else seem to be impure. The very heavens seem to be unclean when compared with him. We are not to understand this as meaning that the heavens are defiled; that there is sin and corruption there, and that they are loathsome in the sight of God. The object is to set forth the exceeding purity of God, and the greatness of his holiness. This sentiment seemed to be a kind of proverb, or a commonplace in theology among the sages of Arabia. Thus, it occurs in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/25-5.htm">Job 25:5</a>, in the speech of Bildad, when he had nothing to say but to repeat the most common-place moral and theological adages - <p>Behold even to the moon, and it shineth not;<p>Yea, the stars are not pure in his sight:<p>How much less man, that is a worm,<p>And the son of man, which is a worm! <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15.

In holy men, set apart for himself by his grace, whose sins are expiated by the blood of his Son, and whose hearts are sanctified by his Spirit, and who live holy lives and conversations, as Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; these, though he trusts many of them with much, as the prophets of old with the messages of his grace and will, and the ministers of the word with treasure, in their earthen vessels, the sacred "depositum" of the glorious Gospel, with gifts of grace, fitting them for their work, and with the care of the souls of men; yet he trusts none of them with themselves, with the redemption and salvation of their souls, with the regeneration and sanctification of their hearts, and with their preservation to eternal glory; he has put those into the hands of his Son and Spirit, and keeps them by his power through faith unto salvation: the Targum renders it, in his saints above, in the saints in heaven, in glorified men; he is there their all in all; as their happiness, so their safety and protection; see an instance of his care and preservation of them after the resurrection, when in a perfect state, <a href="/revelation/20-8.htm">Revelation 20:8</a>; or this may be understood of the angels, who sometimes are called saints, <a href="/deuteronomy/33-2.htm">Deuteronomy 33:2</a>; who though they have been trusted with many things to impart to the sons of men, yet not with the salvation of men, nor even with the secret of it; they were not of God's privy council when the affair was debated and settled; nor with other secrets, as the day and hour of the last judgment, the coming of the Son of Man: or the sense may be, "he putteth no perfection or stability" (d) in them, that is, perfection in comparison of his; for if theirs were equal to his, they would be gods, which it is impossible to be, or for God to make them such; and likewise such stability as to have been able to have stood of themselves, which it appears they had not, since many of them fell, and the rest needed confirming grace, which they have by Christ, the Head of all principalities and powers: <p>yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight; heaven born men, partakers of the heavenly calling, whose hearts and affections are set on heavenly things, and have their conversation in heaven; yet these, in the sight of a pure and holy God, and in comparison of him, are impure and unholy; or they of heaven, as Mr. Broughton renders it, the inhabitants of heaven; the angels on high, as the Targum paraphrases it; these are charged by him with folly, and they, conscious of their imperfection with respect to him, cover their faces with their wings, while they celebrate the perfection of his holiness, who is so glorious in it; though the natural heavens may be intended, at least not excluded, and the luminous bodies in them, as Bildad seems to explain it, <a href="/job/25-5.htm">Job 25:5</a>; the stars are reckoned the more dense and thick part of the heavens, the moon has its spots, and by later discoveries it seems the sun is not without them, and the heavens are often covered with clouds and darkness, and the present ones will be purified with fire at the general conflagration, which supposes them unclean, and they shall pass away, and new ones succeed, which implies imperfection in the former, or there would be no need of others; this is the proof Eliphaz gives of what he had suggested in <a href="/job/15-14.htm">Job 15:14</a>. <p>(d)  "non posuit stabilitatem", Pagninus; "immutabilitatem, sive perfectionem absolutam", Vatablus; "firmum opus non produxit", Tigurine version; "non crediturns esset firmitatem", Junius &amp; Tremellius. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/15.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Behold, he putteth no trust in his saints; yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/job/15.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">15</span>. <span class="ital">his saints</span>] <span class="bld">his holy ones</span>, i. e.

Eliphaz here, as in <a href="/job/5-1.htm">Job 5:1</a>, speaks not of holy men, but of the holy angels. Without taxing them with sin, he is strongly convinced of their imperfection - their defective wisdom (<a href="/job/5-18.htm">Job 5:18</a>), weakness, and untrustworthiness. His views are decidedly peculiar, and not borne out by the rest of Scripture. <span class="cmt_word">Yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight.</span> The material heavens are probably intended.

Schlottman calls to mind an ironical proverbial expression of the Hindus: "Yea, indeed, he is the first man; no wonder that he is so wise" (Roberts, Orient. Illustr. p. 276). It is not to be translated: wast thou born as the first man, which is as inadmissible as the translation of &#1488;&#1495;&#1514; &#1502;&#1506;&#1496;, <a href="//biblehub.com/haggai/2-6.htm">Haggai 2:6</a>, by "a little" (vid., Khler in loc.); rather &#1512;&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503; (i.e., &#1512;&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503;, as <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/21-10.htm">Joshua 21:10</a>, formed from &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;, like the Arabic ra&#305;&#770;s, from ras, if it is not perhaps a mere incorrect amalgamation of the forms &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503; and &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503;, <a href="/job/8-8.htm">Job 8:8</a>) is in apposition with the subject, and &#1488;&#1491;&#1501; is to be regarded as predicate, according to Ges. 139, 2. Raschi's translation is also impossible: wast thou born before Adam? for this Greek form of expression, &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, <a href="//biblehub.com/john/1-15.htm">John 1:15</a>, <a href="/john/1-30.htm">John 1:30</a>; <a href="/john/15-18.htm">John 15:18</a> (comp.

In the parallel question, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/15-7.htm">Job 15:7</a>, Umbr., Schlottm., and Renan (following Ewald) see a play upon <a href="/proverbs/8-24.htm">Proverbs 8:24</a>.: art thou the demiurgic Wisdom itself? But the introductory proverbs (<a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/1.htm">Proverbs 1-9</a>) are more recent than the book of Job (vid., supra, p. 24), and indeed probably, as we shall show elsewhere, belong to the time of Jehoshaphat. Consequently the more probable relation is that the writer of <a href="/proverbs/8-24.htm">Proverbs 8:24</a>. has adopted words from the book of Job in describing the pre-existence of the Chokma. Was Job, a higher spirit-nature, brought forth, i.e., as it were amidst the pangs of travail (&#1495;&#1493;&#1500;&#1500;&#1514;, Pulal from &#1495;&#1493;&#1500;, &#1495;&#1497;&#1500;), before the hills? for the angels, according to Scripture, were created before man, and even before the visible universe (vid., <a href="/job/38-4.htm">Job 38:4</a>.). Hirz., Ew., Schlottm., and others erroneously translate the futt. in the questions, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/15-8.htm">Job 15:8</a>, as praes. All the verbs in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/15-7.htm">Job 15:7</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/15-8.htm">Job 15:8</a>, are under the control of the retrospective character which is given to the verses by &#1512;&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503;; comp. <a href="/job/10-10.htm">Job 10:10</a>., where &#1494;&#1499;&#1512;&#1470;&#1504;&#1488; has the same influence, and also <a href="//biblehub.com/job/3-3.htm">Job 3:3</a>, where the historical sense of &#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1491; depends not upon the syntax, but upon logical necessity. Translate therefore: didst thou attend in the secret council (&#1505;&#1493;&#1491;, like <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-18.htm">Jeremiah 23:18</a>, comp. <a href="/psalms/89-8.htm">Psalm 89:8</a>) of Eloah (according to the correct form of writing in Codd. and in Kimchi, Michlol 54a, &#1492;&#1489;&#1505;&#1493;&#1491;, like <a href="/job/15-11.htm">Job 15:11</a> &#1492;&#1502;&#1506;&#1496; and <a href="/job/22-13.htm">Job 22:13</a> &#1492;&#1489;&#1506;&#1491;, with Beth raph. and without Gaja),<p>(Note: As a rule, the interrogative He, when pointed with Pathach, has Gaja against the Pathach <a href="/2_samuel/7-5.htm">2 Samuel 7:5</a>; this, however, falls away (among other instances) when the syllable immediately following the He has the tone, as in the two examples given above (comp. also &#1492;&#1488;&#1500;, <a href="/job/8-3.htm">Job 8:3</a>; &#1492;&#1500;&#1488;&#1500;, <a href="/job/13-7.htm">Job 13:7</a>), or the usual Gaja (Metheg) which stands in the antepenultima (Br, Metheg-Setzung, 23)<p>and didst then acquire for thyself (&#1490;&#1512;&#1506;, here attrahere, like the Arabic, sorbere, to suck in) wisdom? by which one is reminded of Prometheus' fire stolen from heaven. Nay, Job can boast of no extraordinary wisdom. The friends - as Eliphaz, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/15-9.htm">Job 15:9</a>, says in their name - are his contemporaries; and if he desires to appeal to the teaching of his father, and of his ancestors generally, let them know that there are hoary-headed men among themselves, whose discernment is deeper by reason of their more advanced age. &#1490;&#1468;&#1501; is inverted, like <a href="/job/2-10.htm">Job 2:10</a> (which see); and at the same time, since it is sued twice, it is correlative: etiam inter nos et cani et senes. Most modern expositors think that Eliphaz, "in modestly concealed language" (Ewald), refers to himself. But the reference would be obvious enough; and wherefore this modest concealing, which is so little suited to the character of Eliphaz? Moreover, <a href="/job/15-10.htm">Job 15:10</a> does not sound as if speaking merely of one, and in <a href="/job/15-10.htm">Job 15:10</a> Eliphaz would make himself older than he appears to be, for it is nowhere implied that Job is a young man in comparison with him. We therefore with Umbreit explain &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;: in our generation. Thus it sounds more like the Arabic, both in words (keb&#305;&#770;r Arab., usual in the signif. grandaevus) and in substance. Eliphaz appeals to the source of reliable tradition, since they have even among their races and districts mature old men, and since, indeed, according to Job's own admission (<a href="/job/12-12.htm">Job 12:12</a>), there is "wisdom among the ancient ones." </body></html>
