Happy the men who are blessed with such gifts as these! They have great opportunities of honouring God and doing good, but have great need to watch against pride. Happy the people who are blessed with such men! it is a token for good to them. Here we see what Job valued himself by, in the day of his prosperity. It was by his usefulness. He valued himself by the check he gave to the violence of proud and evil men. Good magistrates must thus be a restraint to evil-doers, and protect the innocent; in order to this, they should arm themselves with zeal and resolution. Such men are public blessings, and resemble Him who rescues poor sinners from Satan. How many who were ready to perish, now are blessing Him! But who can show forth His praises?

Job speaks here as a magistrate, and of the time when he went forth to sit as a judge, to try causes.<p>When I prepared my seat in the street - That is, to sit as a judge. The seat or tribunal was placed in the street, in the open air, before the gate of the city, where great numbers might be convened, and hear and see justice done. The Arabs, to this day, hold their courts of justice in an open place, under the heavens, as in a field or a market-place. Norden's Travels in Egypt, ii. 140. There has been, however, great variety of opinion in regard to the meaning of this verse. Schultens enumerates no less than ten different interpretations of the passage. Herder translates it:<p>"When from my house I went to the assembly,<p>And spread my carpet in the place of meeting."<p>Prof. Lee translates it, "When I went forth from the gate to the pulpit, and prepared my seat in the broad place." He supposes that Job refers to occasions when he addressed the people, and to the respect which was shown him then. Dr. Good renders it, "As I went forth, the city rejoiced at me." It is probable, however, that our common version has given the true signification. The word rendered "city" (&#1511;&#1512;&#1514;  qereth), is a poetic form for (&#1511;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492;  qirya&#770;h) "city," but does not frequently occur. It is found in <a href="/proverbs/8-3.htm">Proverbs 8:3</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/9-3.htm">Proverbs 9:3</a>, <a href="/proverbs/9-14.htm">Proverbs 9:14</a>; <a href="/proverbs/11-11.htm">Proverbs 11:11</a>. The phrase "upon the city" - Hebrew &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1470;&#1511;&#1512;&#1514;  &#8219;aly-qereth - or, "over the city," may refer to the fact that the gate was in an elevated place, or that it was the chief place, and, as it were, over or at the head of the city. The meaning is, that as he went out from his house toward the gate that was situated in the most important part of the city, all did him reverence. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/29.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7-10.

Job having described his former state of happiness by the personal favours he enjoyed, and by the prosperity of his family, and his abundance of plenty at home, proceeds to give an account of the honour and respect he had from men of every age and rank abroad: though he had an affluence of the things of this world, he did not indulge himself at home in ease and sloth; but went abroad to take care of the public welfare, maintain public peace, and administer public justice among his neighbours; performing the office of a civil magistrate, which is often expressed in Scripture by going in and out before the people: Job went out from his own house to the gate of the city, where a court of judicature was kept, as it was usual in those times and countries to hold them in the gates of the city; see <a href="/zechariah/8-16.htm">Zechariah 8:16</a>; and to which he passed through the city, very probably, in great pomp and splendour, suitable to his office and character, which drew the eyes and attention of the people to him; by which it should seem that his house was on one side of the city, and the gate where justice was administered was on the other; though it may be rendered, "over the city" (o), and the sense be, that he passed along as he that was over the city, the chief man in it, and president of the court of justice, see <a href="/2_kings/10-5.htm">2 Kings 10:5</a>; <p>when I prepared my seat in the street; where he sat, not as a teacher, though he was an instructor, not only of his family, but of his neighbours, as Eliphaz himself testifies, <a href="/job/4-3.htm">Job 4:3</a>; and it was usual for such to have seats to sit upon, as those had who succeeded Moses, and are said to sit in his chair; and it was usual to call to men and instruct them in open public places; hence Wisdom is said to utter her voice in the streets, in the opening of the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in at the doors, <a href="/proverbs/1-20.htm">Proverbs 1:20</a>; but Job here speaks of himself as a civil magistrate, as a judge upon the bench, who had a seat or throne erected for him to sit upon, while he was hearing and trying causes; and this was set up in the street under the open air, before the gate of the city, where the whole city might be convened together, and hear and see justice done to their neighbours; in such a street, before the gate of the city, Ezra read the law to Israel; and in such an one Hezekiah got the people of Israel together, and spoke comfortably to them when invaded by Sennacherib; see <a href="/nehemiah/8-2.htm">Nehemiah 8:2</a>; and the Arabs, to this day, hold their courts of justice in an open place under the heavens, as in a field, or in a market place (p); and it is right that courts of justice should be open and accessible to all. <p>(o)  "super civitatem", Pagninus, Montanus, Schmidt; "super urbe", Schultens.

For in reference to agriculture &#1495;&#1512;&#1507; can certainly signify the early half of the year (on this, vid., Genesis, S. 270), inasmuch as sowing and ploughing time in Palestine and Syria is in November and December; wherefore Arab. chr&#305;&#770;f signifies the early rain or autumn rain; and in Talmudic, &#1495;&#1512;&#1507;, premature (ripe too early), is the opposite of &#1488;&#1508;&#1500;, late, but the derivatives of &#1495;&#1512;&#1507; only obtain this signification connotative, for, according to its proper signification, &#1495;&#1512;&#1507; (Arab. chr&#305;&#770;f with other forms) is the gathering time, i.e., the time of the fruit harvest (syn. &#1488;&#1505;&#1497;&#1507;), while the Hebr. &#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489; (&#1488;&#1489;) corresponds to the spring in our sense. If Job meant his youth, he would have said &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497; &#1488;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;, or something similar; but as <a href="/job/29-5.htm">Job 29:5</a> shows, he meant his manhood, and this he calls his autumn as the season of maturity, or rather of the abundance of fruits (Schult.: aetatem virilem suis fructibus faetum et exuberantum),<p>(Note: The fresh vegetation, indeed, in hotter districts (e.g., in the valley of the Jordan and Euphrates) begins with the arrival of the autumnal rains, but the real spring (comp. Sol 2:11-13) only begins about the vernal equinox, and still later on the mountains. On the contrary, the late summer, &#1511;&#1497;&#1509;, which passes over into the autumn, &#1495;&#1512;&#1507;, is the season for gathering the fruit. The produce of the fields, garden fruit, and grapes ripen before the commencement of the proper autumn; some (when the land can be irrigated) summer fruits, e.g., Dhura (maize) and melons, in like manner olives and dates, ripen in autumn. Therefore the translation, in the days of my autumn ("of my harvest"), is the only correct one. If &#1495;&#1512;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497; were intended here in a sense not used elsewhere, it might signify, according to the Arabic with h, "(in the days) of my prosperity," or "my power," or even with Arab. ch, "(in the days) of my youthful vigour;" for chara&#770;fa&#770;t are rash words and deeds, charfa&#770;n one who says or does anything rash from lightness, the feebleness of old age, etc. (according to Wetzst., very common words in Syria): &#1495;&#1512;&#1507; or &#1495;&#1512;&#1507;, therefore the thoughtlessness of youth, Arab. jahl, i.e., the rash desire of doing something great, which &#1495;&#1512;&#1507; &#1492;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513; &#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; (<a href="/judges/5-18.htm">Judges 5:18</a>).
