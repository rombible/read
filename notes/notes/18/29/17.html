Happy the men who are blessed with such gifts as these! They have great opportunities of honouring God and doing good, but have great need to watch against pride. Happy the people who are blessed with such men! it is a token for good to them. Here we see what Job valued himself by, in the day of his prosperity. It was by his usefulness. He valued himself by the check he gave to the violence of proud and evil men. Good magistrates must thus be a restraint to evil-doers, and protect the innocent; in order to this, they should arm themselves with zeal and resolution. Such men are public blessings, and resemble Him who rescues poor sinners from Satan. How many who were ready to perish, now are blessing Him! But who can show forth His praises? May we trust in His mercy, and seek to imitate His truth, justice, and love.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/29.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And I brake the jaws of the wicked - Margin, "jaw-teeth, or, grinders."

It is not used to denote the jaw. The image here is taken from wild beasts, with whom Job compares the wicked, and says that he rescued the helpless from their grasp, as he would a lamb from a lion or wolf.<p>And plucked - Margin, "cast." The margin is a literal translation, but the idea is, that he violently seized the spoil or prey which the wicked had taken, and by force tore it from him. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/29.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17.

Their jaw teeth, or grinders, alluding to beasts of prey, who have such teeth, very large; the meaning may be, that Job confuted the arguments which wicked men made use of in their own defence, and against the poor, exposed the weakness of them, and made them ineffectual to answer their purposes; disabled tyrants and cruel oppressors from doing any further hurt and damage to the fatherless and helpless; was an instrument in the hand of God of breaking the power, and weakening the hands of such persons, and hindering them from doing the mischief they otherwise would; see <a href="/proverbs/30-14.htm">Proverbs 30:14</a>; <p>and plucked the spoil out of his teeth; as David took the lamb out of the mouth of the bear and lion that came into his father's flock, and carried it off: thus Job delivered the poor out of the hands of such monsters in nature, comparable to beasts of prey, and saved them from being utterly ruined by them, and obliged them to restore unto them what they had in an unrighteous manner taken from them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/29.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And I brake the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the spoil out of his teeth.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/job/29.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">17</span>.

The futt. consec. affirm what was the inevitable consequence of hearing and seeing; &#1492;&#1506;&#1497;&#1491;, seq. acc., is used like &#1492;&#1494;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512; in the signification of laudatory recognition. The expression is not brachylogical for &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1491; &#1500;&#1468;&#1497; (vid., on <a href="/job/31-18.htm">Job 31:18</a>); for from <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/21-10.htm">1 Kings 21:10</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/21-13.htm">1 Kings 21:13</a>, we perceive that &#1492;&#1506;&#1497;&#1491; with the acc. of the person signifies to make any one the subject of assertion, whether he be lower or higher in rank (comp. the New Testament word, especially in Luke, &#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;). It was, however, not merely the outward manifestation of his unusual prosperity which called forth such admiration, but his active benevolence united with the abundant resources at his command.

The latter is more probable both here and in the Salomonic primary passage, <a href="/psalms/72-12.htm">Psalm 72:12</a>; in the other case &#1493;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1488;&#1497;&#1503;&#1470;&#1506;&#1494;&#1512; &#1500;&#1495; might be expected.</body></html>
