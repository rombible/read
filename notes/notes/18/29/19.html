If such an expectation arise from lively faith in the providence and promise of God, it is well; but if from conceit of our own wisdom, and dependence on changeable, earthly things, it is ill grounded, and turns to sin. Every one that has the spirit of wisdom, has not the spirit of government; but Job had both. Yet he had the tenderness of a comforter. This he thought upon with pleasure, when he was himself a mourner. Our Lord Jesus is a King who hates iniquity, and upon whom the blessing of a world ready to perish comes.

The meaning is, that it was spread abroad or extended far, so that the moisture of the earth had free access to it; or it was like a tree planted near a stream, whose root ran down to the water. This is an image designed to denote great prosperity. In the East, such an image would be more striking than with us. Here green, large, and beautiful trees are so common as to excite little or no attention. In such a country as Arabia, however, where general desolation exists, such a tree would be a most beautiful object, and a most striking image of prosperity; compare DeWette on <a href="/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3</a>.<p>And the dew lay all night upon my branch - In the absence of rain - which seldom falls in deserts - the scanty vegetation is dependent on the dews that fall at night. Those dews are often very abundant. Volney (Travels i. 51) says, "We, who are inhabitants of humid regions, cannot well understand how a country can be productive without rain, but in Egypt, the dew which falls copiously in the night, supplies the place of rain." See, also, Shaw's Travels, p. 379. "To the same cause also (the violent heat of the day), succeeded afterward by the coldness of the night, we may attribute the plentiful dews, and those thick, offensive mists, one or other of which we had every night too sensible a proof of. The dews, particularly, (as we had the heavens only for our covering), would frequently wet us to the skin." The sense here is, as a tree standing on the verge of a river, and watered each night by copious dews, appears beautiful and flourishing, so was my condition. The Septuagint, however, renders this, "And the dew abode at night on my harvest" - &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769; &#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;  kai drosos aulisthe&#772;setai en to&#772; therismo&#772; mou.

A thought, similar to the one in this passage, occurs in a Chinese Ode, translated by Sir William Jones, in his works, vol. ii. p. 351:<p>Vide illius aquae rivum<p>Virides arundines jucunde luxuriant!<p>Sic est decorus virtutibus princeps noster!<p>"Seest thou yon stream, around whose banks<p>The green reeds crowd in joyous ranks?<p>In nutrient virtue and in grace,<p>Such is the Prince that rules our race."<p>Dr. Good <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/29.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19.

According to our version and others, Job here, and in the following verses, gives the reasons of his hope and confidence of his long life, and quiet and comfortable death amidst all his prosperity and happiness; which were founded upon his flourishing circumstances, and the great respect that was shown him among men; and this is the sense, if we read the words in the past tense, as we and many others do; or in the present tense, "my root is spread", &amp;c. as others; but there are some interpreters, both Jewish and Christian (b), that render them in the future tense, here and to the end of the chapter; and so they are a continuation of Job's hope and trust, in the times of his prosperity, that things would always continue as they were with him, and much more abundantly; and indeed all is true of Job, in every sense, and all may be taken into the account; and that these words, and the following, as they describe what had been, and at the then present time, when he concluded the above in his mind, was his case, so they may also declare what he believed would be always his case to the end of his days. Here he compares himself to a tree well rooted and happily situated by plenty of water, and which may be expressive both of his temporal and spiritual prosperity: his outward prosperity seemed to him to have been well settled and established, being like a tree that had taken root, and was like to continue, being watered with the favour and blessing of God, which maketh rich; and as to his spiritual estate, he was like a tree planted by a river of water, to which good men are often compared in Scripture, <a href="/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3</a>; they are in general called trees of righteousness, and are sometimes likened to particular trees, as to olives, cedars, and palm trees; and some think, as Pineda, that it is to the latter Job here has respect; the last clause of <a href="/job/29-18.htm">Job 29:18</a> being in the Latin Vulgate version so rendered as to countenance this sense; and it may be observed that this tree having thick long leaves, and fruit full of juice, and its wood spongy, requires much water; and, as Pliny (c) says, delights in watery places; nor is it content with rain, but is better satisfied with waters flowing about it; hence it is often found necessary to dig about it, and lay its roots open, that the waters may more easily come at them, and flow about them (d) and so the words here in the original text are, "my root" was, is, or shall be "open to the waters" (e): good men, as they are rooted in the love of God, and in the person of Christ, so they have, as Job had, the root of the matter in them, the truth of grace, or a principle of grace; which is watered, and kept alive and flourishing, by the love and favour of God shed abroad in the heart; by fresh supplies of grace out of the fulness of Christ, who is the fountain of gardens, and well of living waters; and by the means of grace, the word and ordinances, the still waters to which saints are led, and by which they are made to lie down, and where they are watered, refreshed, and comforted: <p>and the dew lay all night upon my branch; so that the water being at his root below, and the dew on his branch above, he must be in a fruitful and flourishing condition: the dew is a great blessing to the earth, to trees, herbs, and plants, and the cause of great fertility; and this may respect Job's temporal happiness, in the health and prosperity of his children, who were to him what branches are to a tree; and in the affluence of worldly good things, with which through the blessing of God, as dew upon him, he abounded; and may also have regard to his spiritual affairs: believers in Christ are branches in him, as Job was one; and the dew of divine grace and favour lies upon them continually, even in the darkest seasons; which revives and refreshes their souls, and makes them fruitful in the exercise of grace, and performance of good works; see <a href="/proverbs/19-12.htm">Proverbs 19:12</a>; the dew falls in the night, and the sooner it fails the longer it lies, and is most useful: some render the words "upon my harvest", or "mowing" (f); the dew is of great use in harvest time; mowers and reapers choose the morning to work in, when the stalks are moistened by the dew; and which is of use to keep the ears of corn from shedding by swelling the fibres, and so retaining the grains in their proper places (g); see <a href="/isaiah/18-4.htm">Isaiah 18:4</a>. <p>(b) Jarchi, Ben Gerson, Bar Tzemach, Schmidt, Schultens.

Job compares himself, in his former prosperous state, to a tree growing by a river-side, which receives a double nourishment - from the actual water of the stream, which reaches its roots, and from the moisture evaporated from the stream, which hangs in the air, and descends in the shape of dew upon its leaves and branches.

For the primary attribute, the fundamental character of his way of thinking and acting, was &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;, a holding fast to the will of God, which before everything else calls for sympathizing love (root &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;, Arab. s&#803;dq, to be hard, firm, stiff, e.g., rumh-un sadq-un, according to the Kamus: a hard, firm, straight spear), and &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;, judgment and decision in favour of right and equity against wrong and injustice. Righteousness is here called the garment which he put on (as <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/132-9.htm">Psalm 132:9</a>, comp. <a href="/isaiah/11-5.htm">Isaiah 11:5</a>; <a href="/isaiah/59-17.htm">Isaiah 59:17</a>), and right is the robe and turban with which he adorns himself (comp. <a href="/isaiah/61-10.htm">Isaiah 61:10</a>); as by Arabian poets noble attributes are also called garments, which God puts on any one, or which any one puts on himself (albasa).<p>(Note: In Beidhwi, if I remember rightly, this expression occurs once, Arab. 'l-tdrr&#8219; blbls 'l-tqwy, i.e., "clothing one's self in the armour of the fear of God.")<p>Righteousness is compared to the &#1500;&#1489;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473; (corresponding to the thob, i.e., garment, indusium, of the nomads) which is worn on the naked body, justice to the &#1510;&#1504;&#1497;&#1507;, a magnificent turban (corresponding to the kefije, consisting of a thick cotton cloth, and fastened with a cord made of camel's hair), and the magnificent robe (corresponding to the second principal article of clothing, the &#8219;aba&#770;). The lxx, Jer., Syr., and Arab. wrongly refer &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497; to &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1496;&#1497; of the second half of the verse, while, on the contrary, it is said of &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;, per antanaclasin, that Job put this on, and this in turn put Job on, induit; for &#1493;&#1497;&#1500;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;, as the usage of the language, as we have it, elsewhere shows, does not signify: it (righteousness) clothed me well (Umbr.), or: adorned me (Ew., Vaih.), also not: it dressed me out (Schlottm.), but only: it put me on as a garment, i.e., it made me so its own, that my whole appearance was the representation of itself, as in <a href="/judges/6-34.htm">Judges 6:34</a> and twice in the Chronicles, of the Spirit of Jehovah it is said that He puts on any one, induit, when He makes any one the organ of His own manifestation. </body></html>
