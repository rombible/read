Happy the men who are blessed with such gifts as these! They have great opportunities of honouring God and doing good, but have great need to watch against pride. Happy the people who are blessed with such men! it is a token for good to them. Here we see what Job valued himself by, in the day of his prosperity. It was by his usefulness. He valued himself by the check he gave to the violence of proud and evil men. Good magistrates must thus be a restraint to evil-doers, and protect the innocent; in order to this, they should arm themselves with zeal and resolution. Such men are public blessings, and resemble Him who rescues poor sinners from Satan. How many who were ready to perish, now are blessing Him! But who can show forth His praises? May we trust in His mercy, and seek to imitate His truth, justice, and love.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/29.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I was a father to the poor - I took them under my protection, and treated them as if they were my own children.<p>And the cause which I knew not I searched out - This is according to the interpretation of Jerome. But the more probable meaning is, "the cause of him who was unknown to me, that is, of the stranger, I searched out." So Rosenmuller, Herder, Umbreit, and Good. According to this, the sense is, that, as a magistrate, he gave particular attention to the cause of the stranger, and investigated it with care. It is possible that Job here designs specifically to reply to the charge brought against him by Eliphaz in <a href="/job/22-6.htm">Job 22:6</a> ff. The duty of showing particular attention to the stranger is often inculcated in the Bible, and was regarded as essential to a character of uprightness and piety among the Orientals. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/29.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16.

Not in a literal sense; for his children were rich as well as himself, while he had them; but in a civil sense, he was the patron of the poor; he was an advocate for them, he took their part, he pleaded their cause, defended their persons, and secured the little property they had; he had the pity and compassion of a father for them, and supplied their wants; he fed them and clothed them; he did not eat his morsel alone, but gave them part of it, and warmed them with the fleece of his flock: <p>and the cause which I knew not I searched out; any cause that was brought before him, he knew thing of before, and which, upon the opening of it, did not appear plain and easy, but had its difficulties; this he closely examined, and searched thoroughly into the merits of, till it appeared plain to him on which side the truth and justice of it lay; he did not hurry it over, and pass sentence, having only in a superficial manner considered it, as is too often the case; but after a long examination of the contending parties, and of the witnesses on both sides, to whom he gave an impartial hearing, he pronounced the decisive sentence; see <a href="/proverbs/25-2.htm">Proverbs 25:2</a>. Some think this refers to his diligent search and inquiry after causes that were not brought before him; he did, not wait for application to be made to him, but hearing of, or upon inquiry finding, that there were persons oppressed and distressed by cruel men, he of himself voluntarily offered his assistance, searched into their cause, made himself master of it, and freed them from their distresses; so different were his behaviour and character from that of the unjust judge, <a href="/luke/18-1.htm">Luke 18:1</a>; though others, choose to render the words, "the cause of him that I knew not", &amp;c. (t); of a stranger, of one that he had never seen before, of one that was most unknown to him in the world; the cause of such an one he took as, much pains with to get the true knowledge of, and do justice to, as of the dearest relation, the nearest neighbour, and the most intimate friend and acquaintance that he had. <p>(t) "quem non cognoveram", Junius &amp; Tremellius, Michaelis; "ignotissimi", Schultens. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/29.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">I was a father to the poor: and the cause which I knew not I searched out.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/job/29.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">16</span>. <span class="ital">the cause which I knew not</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">the cause of him whom I knew not</span>.

Schekalim ii. 5 (in Pinner's Compendium des Thalmud, S. 58): "R. Jochanan was walking and leaning upon R. Chija bar-Abba, R. Eliezer perceived him and hid himself from him (&#1493;&#1502;&#1496;&#1502;&#1512; &#1500;&#1495; &#1502;&#1511;&#1502;&#1497;). Then said R. Jochanan: This Babylonian insulted him (R. Chija) by two things; first that he did not salute him, and then that he hid himself. But R. Jakob bar-Idi answered him, it is the custom with them for the less not to salute the greater, - a custom which confirms Job's words: Young men saw me and his themselves.")<p>and old men (hoary heads) stood up, remained standing (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;, as <a href="/job/20-19.htm">Job 20:19</a>; <a href="/job/28-4.htm">Job 28:4</a>). &#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; signifies to stand up, &#1506;&#1502;&#1491; to advance towards any one and remain standing.

All stepped back and desisted from speaking before him: The speech of illustrious men (&#1504;&#1490;&#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; from &#1504;&#1490;&#1491;, Arab. njd, to be visible, pleasant to the sight, comp. supra, p. 510) hid itself (not daring to be heard), and the tongue of the same clave (motionless) to their palate. We do not translate: as to the voice illustrious men hid themselves, for it is only the appearance produced by the attractional construction Ges. 148, 1 that has led to the rendering of &#1511;&#1493;&#1500;&#1470;&#1504;&#1490;&#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; as an acc. of closer definition (Schult., Hahn: quod ad vocem eminentium, comprimebantur). The verb is construed with the second member of the genitival expression instead of with the first, as with &#1502;&#1505;&#1508;&#1512;, <a href="/job/15-20.htm">Job 15:20</a>; <a href="/job/21-21.htm">Job 21:21</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/38-21.htm">Job 38:21</a>, and with &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;, <a href="/job/22-12.htm">Job 22:12</a>; a construction which occurs with &#1511;&#1493;&#1500; not merely in such exclamatory sentences as <a href="/genesis/4-10.htm">Genesis 4:10</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/52-8.htm">Isaiah 52:8</a>, but also under other conditions, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/1-41.htm">1 Kings 1:41</a>, comp. <a href="/job/14-6.htm">Job 14:6</a>. This may be best called an attraction of the predicate by the second member of the compound subject, like the reverse instance, <a href="/isaiah/2-11.htm">Isaiah 2:11</a>; and it is sometimes found even where this second member is not logically the more important. Thus Ew. transl.: "the voice of the nobles hides itself;" whereas Olsh., wrongly denying that the partt. in passages like <a href="/genesis/4-10.htm">Genesis 4:10</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/1-41.htm">1 Kings 1:41</a>, are to be taken as predicative, wishes to read &#1504;&#1495;&#1489;&#1488;, which is the more inadmissible, as even the choice of the verb is determined by the attractional construction.<p>The strophe which follows tells how it came to pass that those in authority among the citizens submitted to him, and that on all sides the people were zealous to show him tokens of respect. </body></html>
