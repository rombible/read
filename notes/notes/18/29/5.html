A gracious soul delights in God's smiles, not in the smiles of this world. Four things were then very pleasant to holy Job. 1. The confidence he had in the Divine protection. 2. The enjoyment he had of the Divine favour. 3. The communion he had with the Divine word. 4. The assurance he had of the Divine presence. God's presence with a man in his house, though it be but a cottage, makes it a castle and a palace. Then also he had comfort in his family. Riches and flourishing families, like a candle, may be soon extinguished. But when the mind is enlightened by the Holy Spirit, when a man walks in the light of God's countenance, every outward comfort is doubled, every trouble is diminished, and he may pass cheerfully by this light through life and through death. Yet the sensible comfort of this state is often withdrawn for a season; and commonly this arises from sinful neglect, and grieving the Holy Spirit: sometimes it may be a trial of a man's faith and grace. But it is needful to examine ourselves, to seek for the cause of such a change by fervent prayer, and to increase our watchfulness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/29.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>When the Almighty was yet with me - Job regarded God as withdrawn from him.

These are terribly sad words.

But even the temporal use of &#1500; in &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; at the turn (of morning, of evening, e.g., <a href="/genesis/24-63.htm">Genesis 24:63</a>) cannot be compared, but &#1500;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1514; signifies perficiendo  equals  quum perficeret (as e.g., <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-29.htm">2 Samuel 18:29</a>, mittendo  equals  quum mitteret), it is a gerundival inf. Ngelsb. S. 197f., 2nd edition); and because it is the past that is spoken of, the modal inf. can be continued in the perf., Ges. 132, rem. 2. The thought that God, when He created the world, appointed fixed laws of equable and salutary duration, he particularizes by examples: He appointed to the wind its weight, i.e., the measure of its force or feebleness; distributed the masses of water by measure; appointed to the rain its law, i.e., the conditions of its development and of its beginning; appointed the way, i.e., origin and course, to the lightning (&#1495;&#1494;&#1497;&#1494; from &#1495;&#1494;&#1494;, Arab. h&#803;zz, secare). When He thus created the world, and regulated what was created by laws, then He perceived (&#1512;&#1488;&#1492;&#1468; with He Mappic. according to the testimony of the Masora) it, wisdom, viz., as the ideal of all things; then He declared it, enarravit, viz., by creating the world, which is the development and realization of its substance; then He gave it a place &#1492;&#1499;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492;&#1468; (for which Dderl. and Ewald unnecessarily read &#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492;&#1468;), viz., to create the world after its pattern, and to commit the arrangement of the world as a whole to its supreme protection and guidance; then He also searched it out or tested it, viz., its demiurgic powers, by setting them in motion to realize itself.<p>If we compare <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/8-22.htm">Proverbs 8:22-31</a> with this passage, we may say: the &#1495;&#1499;&#1502;&#1492; is the divine ideal-world, the divine imagination of all things before their creation, the complex unity of all the ideas, which are the essence of created things and the end of their development. "Wisdom," says one of the old theologians,<p>(Note: Vid., Jul. Hamberger, Lehre Jak. Bhme's, S. 55.)<p>"is a divine imagination, in which the ideas of the angels and souls and all things were seen from eternity, not as already actual creatures, but as a man beholds himself in a mirror." It is not directly one with the Logos, but the Logos is the demiurg by which God has called the world into existence according to that ideal which was in the divine mind. Wisdom is the impersonal model, the Logos the personal master-builder according to that model. Nevertheless the notions, here or in the alter cognate portion of Scripture, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/8-22.htm">Proverbs 8:22-31</a>, are not as yet so distinct as the New Testament revelation of God has first of all rendered possible. In those days, when God realized the substance of the &#1495;&#1499;&#1502;&#1492;, this eternal mirror of the world, in the creation of the world, He also gave man the law, corresponding to which he corresponds to His idea and participates in wisdom. Fearing the supreme Lord (&#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497;) only here in the book of Job, one of the 134 &#1493;&#1491;&#1488;&#1497;&#1503;, i.e., passages, where &#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497; is not merely to be read instead of &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;, but is actually written),<p>(Note: Vid., Buxtorf's Tiberias, p. 245; comp. Br's Psalterium, p. 133.)<p>and renouncing evil (&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; &#1502;&#1512;&#1506;, according to another less authorized mode of writing &#1502;&#1512;&#1506;), - this is man's share of wisdom, this is his relative wisdom, by which he remains in connection with the absolute. This is true human &#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;, in contrast to all high-flown and profound speculations; comp. <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/3-7.htm">Proverbs 3:7</a>, where, in like manner, "fear Jehovah" is placed side by side with "depart from evil," and <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/16-6.htm">Proverbs 16:6</a>, according to which it is rendered possible &#1505;&#1493;&#1512; &#1502;&#1512;&#1506;, to escape the evil of sin and its punishment by fearing God. "The fear of God is the beginning of wisdom" (<a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>; comp. <a href="/psalms/111-10.htm">Psalm 111:10</a>) is the symbolum, the motto and uppermost principle, of that Israelitish Chokma, whose greatest achievement is the book of Job. The whole of <a href="/job/28-1.htm">Job 28:1</a> is a minute panegyric of this principle, the materials of which are taken from the far-distant past; and it is very characteristic, that, in the structure of the book, this twenty-eighth chapter is the clasp which unites the half of the &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; with the half of the &#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, and that the poet has inscribed upon this clasp that sentence, "The fear of God is the beginning of wisdom." But, moreover, Job's closing speech, which ends in this celebration of the praise of the &#1495;&#1499;&#1502;&#1492;, also occupies an important position, which must not be determined, in the structure of the whole.<p>continued...</body></html>
