Happy the men who are blessed with such gifts as these! They have great opportunities of honouring God and doing good, but have great need to watch against pride. Happy the people who are blessed with such men! it is a token for good to them. Here we see what Job valued himself by, in the day of his prosperity. It was by his usefulness. He valued himself by the check he gave to the violence of proud and evil men. Good magistrates must thus be a restraint to evil-doers, and protect the innocent; in order to this, they should arm themselves with zeal and resolution. Such men are public blessings, and resemble Him who rescues poor sinners from Satan. How many who were ready to perish, now are blessing Him! But who can show forth His praises? May we trust in His mercy, and seek to imitate His truth, justice, and love.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/29.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I put on righteousness - Or "justice" - as a magistrate, and in all his transactions with his fellow-men.

It constitutes the most elegant part of his dress; Notes at <a href="/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1</a>. The idea is, that his strict justice was to him what the full flowing robe was in apparel. It was that for which he was best known; that by which he was distinguished, as one would be by an elegant and costly robe.<p>And a diadem - Or, "turban". The word used here &#1510;&#1504;&#1497;&#1507;  tsa&#770;n&#305;&#770;yph - is from &#1510;&#1504;&#1507;  tsa&#770;naph, to roll, or wind around, and is applied to the turban, because it was thus wound around the head. It is applied to the mitre of the high priest <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/3-5.htm">Zechariah 3:5</a>, and may also be to a diadem or crown. It more properly here, however, denotes the "turban," which in the East is an essential part of dress.

Not the righteousness of his living Redeemer, the robe of righteousness and garment of salvation he had from him; though he had put on that by faith, and it was his clothing in the sight of God, which covered his person, and covered all his sins from the avenging eye of divine justice; and in which he was presented before God unblamable and irreprovable in his sight, and with which he was adorned and beautified, being made perfectly comely through it, and completely justified by it; but legal righteousness in the administration of his office as a magistrate; he put it on, that is, he exercised it, and he exercised it constantly from morning tonight, and day after day; as a man puts on his clothes in a morning, and keeps them on all the day, and which he is always repeating; and it was as visible in him, and to be seen and observed by all, as the clothes on his back; and it covered him all over as a garment does; no blemish was to be seen in him, or blame to be cast upon him, throughout the whole course of his administration; and this was a fence unto him against all calumny and reproach, as garments are against the inclemency of the weather; see <a href="/1_samuel/12-3.htm">1 Samuel 12:3</a>; so a godly conversation in the exercise of graces and virtues, and in the performance of duties both to God and man, is sometimes expressed by a putting them on, as garments are put on; see <a href="/ephesians/4-24.htm">Ephesians 4:24</a>; and these are an outward clothing to appear in before men, and should be shown forth with meekness and wisdom, so as to be beheld by men; and should be continually exercised and constantly performed; and then they are a covering with respect to men, and they appear harmless, blameless, and without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation; and thus, by well doing, put to silence the ignorance of foolish men, and such to the blush, those who falsely accuse their good conversation: and this in every sense was Job's case: <p>my judgment was as a robe and diadem; such as the high priest among the Jews wore in the execution of his office, which made him look grand and majestic; and it was usual in Job's time, as it is in ours, and has been the custom in all ages and countries, for judges and civil magistrates to be clothed in a different manner from others, as it is proper they should, to command an awe and reverence of them among the common people, and make them respectable to them: but Job did not so much regard his purple robe he was clad in, or the distinguishing turban he wore on his head, or whatever it was, and which might bear some resemblance to a mitre or a diadem; as it was his great concern to administer justice, which he reckoned his greatest honour, and was more ornamental to him than all the showy ensigns of his office; and it was this which gave him honour and esteem among all sorts of men, high and low: and his regard to the poor, before observed, did not arise from a foolish commiseration of them as poor men, and in order to get himself a name for his pity to them, but proceeded upon a principle of justice and equity, which he made the rule of his administration; he did not countenance the poor in his cause right or wrong; not the quality of the person, but the righteousness of his cause, was what he attended to; and he took his part not merely because he was a poor man, but seeing his cause was just. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/29.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">I put on <span class="cverse3">{l}</span> righteousness, and it clothed me: my judgment <i>was</i> as a robe and a diadem.</span><p>(l) I delighted to do justice, as others did to wear costly apparel.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/job/29.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">14</span>. <span class="ital">and it clothed me</span>] Rather, and it <span class="bld">clothed itself in me</span>.

We do not translate: as to the voice illustrious men hid themselves, for it is only the appearance produced by the attractional construction Ges. 148, 1 that has led to the rendering of &#1511;&#1493;&#1500;&#1470;&#1504;&#1490;&#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; as an acc. of closer definition (Schult., Hahn: quod ad vocem eminentium, comprimebantur).
