"One who called on Eloah (&#1500;&#1488;&#1500;&#1493;&#1492;&#1468;, for which &#1500;&#1488;&#1500;&#1493;&#1492;&#1468; is found in lxx at <a href="/job/36-2.htm">Job 36:2</a>) and He heard him" is in apposition to the subject; likewise &#1514;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1510;&#1491;&#1497;&#1511;, which is to be explained according to <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/11-5.htm">Proverbs 11:5</a>, &#1510;&#1491;&#1497;&#1511; (from &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;, Arab. s&#803;dq, to be hard, firm, stiff, straight), is one who in his conduct rules himself strictly according to the will of God; &#1514;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, one whose thoughts are in all respects and without disguise what they should be-in one word: pure. Most old translators (Targ., Vulg., Luther) give &#1500;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491; the signification, a torch. Thus e.g., Levi v. Gerson explains: "According to the view of the prosperous and carnally secure, he who is ready for falterings of the feet, i.e., likely to fall, is like a lighted torch which burns away and destroys whatever comes in contact with it, and therefore one keeps aloof from him; but it is also more than this: he is an object of contempt in their eyes." Job might not inappropriately say, that in the eyes of the prosperous he is like a despised, cast-away torch (comp. the similar figure, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/14-19.htm">Isaiah 14:19</a>, like a branch that is rejected with contempt); and <a href="/job/12-5.htm">Job 12:5</a> would be suitably connected with this if &#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491;&#1497; could be derived from a substantive &#1502;&#1506;&#1491;, vacillatio, but neither the usage of the language nor the scriptio plena (after which Jerome translates tempus statutum, and consequently has in mind the &#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;, times of festal pilgrimages, which are also called &#1512;&#1512;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; in later times), nor the vowel pointing (instead of which &#1502;&#1506;&#1491;&#1497; would be expected), is favourable to this. &#1512;&#1490;&#1500; &#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491;&#1497; signifies vacillantes pede, those whose prosperity is shaken, and who are in danger of destruction that is near at hand. We therefore, like Abenezra and modern expositors, who are here happily agreed, take &#1500;&#1508;&#1497;&#1491; as composed of &#1500; and &#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491;, a word common to the books of Job (<a href="/job/30-24.htm">Job 30:24</a>; <a href="/job/31-29.htm">Job 31:29</a>) and Proverbs (ch. <a href="/proverbs/24-22.htm">Proverbs 24:22</a>), which is compared by the Jewish lexicographers, according both to form and meaning, to &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491; (<a href="/job/21-20.htm">Job 21:20</a>) and &#1488;&#1497;&#1491;, and perhaps signifies originally dissolution (comp. &#1508;&#1491;&#1492;), decease (Syr. f'jodo, escape; Arab. faid, dying), fall, then generally calamity, misfortune: contempt (befits) misfortune, according to the thoughts (or thinking), idea of the prosperous. The pointing wavers between &#1500;&#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; and the more authorized &#1500;&#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;, with which Parchon compares the nouns &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; and &#1502;&#1512;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;; the &#1514;, like &#1491; in the latter word, has Dag. lene, since the punctuation is in this respect not quite consistent, or follows laws at present unknown (comp. Ges. 21, rem. 2). <a href="/job/12-5.htm">Job 12:5</a> is now suitably connected: ready (with reference to &#1489;&#1493;&#1494;) for those who stumble, i.e., contempt certainly awaits such, it is ready and waiting for them, &#1504;&#1499;&#1493;&#1503;, &#x3b5;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, like <a href="/exodus/34-2.htm">Exodus 34:2</a>.<p>While the unfortunate, in spite of his innocence, has thus only to expect contempt, the tents, i.e., dwellings and possessions, of the oppressor and the marauder remain in prosperity; &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468; for &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;, an intensive form used not only in pause (<a href="/psalms/36-8.htm">Psalm 36:8</a>; comp. <a href="/deuteronomy/32-37.htm">Deuteronomy 32:37</a>) and with greater distinctives (<a href="/numbers/34-6.htm">Numbers 34:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/122-6.htm">Psalm 122:6</a>), but also in passages where it receives no such accent (<a href="/psalms/36-9.htm">Psalm 36:9</a>; <a href="/psalms/57-2.htm">Psalm 57:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/73-2.htm">Psalm 73:2</a>). On &#1488;&#1492;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, instead of &#1488;&#1492;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, vid., Ges. 93, 6, 3. The verbal clause (<a href="/job/12-6.htm">Job 12:6</a>) is followed by a substantival clause (<a href="/job/12-6.htm">Job 12:6</a>). &#1489;&#1468;&#1496;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; is an abstract plural from &#1489;&#1468;&#1496;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;, perfectly secure; therefore: the most care-less security is the portion of those who provoke God (lxx &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;); <p>(Note: Luther takes &#1489;&#1496;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; as the adverb to &#1502;&#1512;&#1490;&#1497;&#1494;&#1497;: und toben wider Gott thrstiglich (vid., Vilmar, Pastoraltheolog. Bltter, 1861, S. 110-112); according to the Vulg., et audacter provocant Deum.)<p>and this is continued in an individualizing form: him who causes Eloah to go into his hand. Seb. Schmid explains this passage in the main correctly: qui Deum in manu fert h.e. qui manum aut potentiam suam pro Deo habet et licitum sibi putat quodlibet; comp. <a href="/habakkuk/1-11.htm">Habakkuk 1:11</a> : "this his strength becomes God to him," i.e., he deifies his own power, and puts it in the place of God. But &#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488; signifies, in this connection with &#1500;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493; (not &#1489;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;), neither to carry, nor to lead (Gesenius, who compares <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/74-5.htm">Psalm 74:5</a>, where, however, it signifies to cause to go into  equals  to strike into); it must be translated: he who causes Eloah to enter into his hand; from which translation it is clear that not the deification of the hand, but of that which is taken into the hand, is meant. This which is taken into the hand is not, however, an idol (Abenezra), but the sword; therefore: him who thinks after the manner of Lamech, <p>(Note: [Comp Pentateuch, at <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/4-25.htm">Genesis 4:25</a>, Clark's Foreign Theological Library. - Tr.])<p>as he takes the iron weapon of attack and defence into his hand, that he needs no other God. </body></html>
