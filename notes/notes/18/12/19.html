The latter part of this chapter seems to re-echo the sentiments of Eliphaz in <a href="/context/job/5-11.htm" title="To set up on high those that be low; that those which mourn may be exalted to safety.">Job 5:11-16</a>; but, instead of giving them the optimist direction he had sketched, he confesses that his own position is rather one of blank despair. Eliphaz is quite sure he possesses the key to the interpretation of the ways of Providence. Job ever fears that his ignorance is so profound as to amount almost to sheer hopelessness, Job is thus the type of a man who has felt the hollowness and unreality of traditional orthodox), and is feeling his way in thick darkness, sustained, nevertheless, by an unquenchable faith that there is light, and that the light will eventually dawn. That this character is the more acceptable to the God of truth is made abundantly clear in the sequel. It is to be observed, however, that Job’s breadth of view far exceeds that of Eliphaz, inasmuch as the latter generalises vaguely, while Job declares that not men, but <span class= "ital">nations, </span>are the subjects of God’s guiding providence.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/job/12.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>12:12-25 This is a noble discourse of Job concerning the wisdom, power, and sovereignty of God, in ordering all the affairs of the children of men, according to the counsel of His own will, which none can resist. It were well if wise and good men, who differ about lesser things, would see how it is for their honour and comfort, and the good of others, to dwell most upon the great things in which they agree. Here are no complaints, or reflections. He gives many instances of God's powerful management of the children of men, overruling all their counsels, and overcoming all their oppositions. Having all strength and wisdom, God knows how to make use, even of those who are foolish and bad; otherwise there is so little wisdom and so little honesty in the world, that all had been in confusion and ruin long ago. These important truths were suited to convince the disputants that they were out of their depth in attempting to assign the Lord's reasons for afflicting Job; his ways are unsearchable, and his judgments past finding out. Let us remark what beautiful illustrations there are in the word of God, confirming his sovereignty, and wisdom in that sovereignty: but the highest and infinitely the most important is, that the Lord Jesus was crucified by the malice of the Jews; and who but the Lord could have known that this one event was the salvation of the world?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He leadeth princes away spoiled - That is, plundered. The word here rendered "princes" &#1499;&#1492;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;  ko&#770;he&#770;n&#305;&#770;ym means properly priests, and it is usually so rendered in the Scriptures. The ancient Hebrew interpreters suppose that the word sometimes also means prince. The Chaldee paraphrasist has not unfrequently so rendered it, using the word &#1512;&#1489;&#1488; to express it; <a href="/genesis/41-45.htm">Genesis 41:45</a>; <a href="/psalms/110-4.htm">Psalm 110:4</a>. In this place, the Vulgate renders it, "sacerdotes;" and the Septuagint, &#x3b9;&#788;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2;  hiereis, "priests." So Luther renders it, "Priester." So Castellio. It can be applied to princes or statesmen only because priests were frequently engaged in performing the functions of civil officers, and were in fact to a certain extent officers of the government. But it seems to me that it is to be taken in its usual signification, and that it means that even the ministers of religion were at the control of God, and were subject to the same reverses as other people of distinction and power.<p>And overthroweth - The word used here (&#1505;&#1500;&#1507;  sa&#770;laph) has the notion of slipping, or gliding. So in Arabic, the word means to slip by, and to besmear; see <a href="/proverbs/13-6.htm">Proverbs 13:6</a> : "Wickedness overthroweth &#1514;&#1505;&#1500;&#1507;  tesa&#770;laph, causes to slip) the sinner;" compare <a href="/proverbs/21-12.htm">Proverbs 21:12</a>; <a href="/proverbs/22-12.htm">Proverbs 22:12</a>. Here it means to overthrow, to prostrate.

Of their principalities and dominions, of their wealth and riches, and of their honour and glory; or "priests" (u), as some choose to render the word, against whom God has indignation for their sins, and leads them into captivity with others; so the Septuagint version, "he leads the priests captives"; for no office, ever so sacred, can protect wicked men, see <a href="/lamentations/2-6.htm">Lamentations 2:6</a>; and from these sometimes the law perishes, and they are spoiled of their wisdom and knowledge, and made unfit to instruct the people, and so of their credit and reputation among them. Sephorno interprets it of the priests spoiled of their prophesying, they prophesying false things to kings: <p>and overthroweth the mighty; the mighty angels from heaven when they sinned, and mighty men on earth, kings and princes, whom he puts down from their seats of majesty and grandeur. Sephorno interprets this of kings, whose ways are perverted, by being led by false prophets, as Ahab was. Some (w) understand this of ecclesiastical men, mighty in word and doctrine, well grounded in theology, yet their wisdom being taken away from them, they turn aside into wicked paths, practices, and principles, and fall from their steadfastness in truth and holiness. <p>(u) "sacerdotes", V.

This is the only mention of "priests" in the Book of Job, and a priest-caste, such as that of Egypt or of Israel, can scarcely be meant. The priests are placed among the mighty, on a par with kings (ver. 18), princes (ver. 21), and "the strong" (ver. 21). This context makes us naturally think of those priest-kings whom we hear of in the olden times, such as were Melchizedek (<a href="/genesis/19-18.htm">Genesis 19:18-20</a>) and Jethro (<a href="/exodus/3-1.htm">Exodus 3:1</a>; <a href="/exodus/18-1.htm">Exodus 18:1-27</a>), and the Egyptian kings of the twenty-first dynasty ('History of Ancient Egypt,' vol. 2. pp. 408-415), and Ethbaal of Tyro ('History of Phoenicia,' p. 435), and Sethos (Herod., 2, 141), and others. Job's allusion is probably to persons of this exalted class, who no doubt were sometimes defeated and dragged into captivity, like other rulers and governors. And overthroweth the mighty. Schultens understands by <span class="accented">ethanim</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d9;&#x5d7;&#x5e0;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>) "great teachers;" but the ordinary meaning of the word is "strong" or "mighty" (see <a href="/job/33-19.htm">Job 33:19</a>; <a href="/micah/6-2.htm">Micah 6:2</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>11  Shall not the ear try sayings,<p>As the palate tasteth food?<p>12  Among the ancients is wisdom,<p>And long life is understanding.<p>13  With Him is wisdom and strength;<p>Counsel and understanding are His.<p>The meaning of <a href="/job/12-11.htm">Job 12:11</a> is, that the sayings (&#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503;, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/8-10.htm">Job 8:10</a>, comp. <a href="/job/5-27.htm">Job 5:27</a>) of the ancients are not to be accepted without being proved; the waw in &#1493;&#1495;&#1498; is waw adaequationis, as <a href="/job/5-7.htm">Job 5:7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/11-12.htm">Job 11:12</a>, therefore equivalent to quemadmodum; it places together for comparison things that are analogous: The ear, which is used here like &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; (<a href="/hebrews/5-14.htm">Hebrews 5:14</a>), has the task of searching out and testing weighty sayings, as the palate by tasting has to find out delicious and suitable food; this is indicated by &#1500;&#1493;, the dat. commodi. So far Job recognises the authority of these traditional sayings. At any rate, he adds (<a href="/job/12-12.htm">Job 12:12</a>): wisdom is to be expected from the hoary-headed, and length of life is understanding, i.e., it accompanies length of life. "Length of days" may thus be taken as the subject (Ewald, Olsh.); but &#1489;&#1468; may also, with the old translations and expositors, be carried forward from the preceding clause: &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#837; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b7; (lxx). We prefer, as the most natural: long life is a school of understanding. But - such is the antithesis in <a href="/job/12-13.htm">Job 12:13</a> which belongs to this strophe - the highest possessor of wisdom, as of might, is God. Ewald inserts two self-made couplets before <a href="//biblehub.com/job/12-12.htm">Job 12:12</a>, which in his opinion are required both by the connection and "the structure of the strophe;" we see as little need for this interpolation here as before, <a href="/job/6-14.htm">Job 6:14</a>. &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493; and &#1500;&#1493;, which are placed first for the sake of emphasis, manifestly introduce an antithesis; and it is evident from the antithesis, that the One who is placed in contrast to the many men of experience is God. Wisdom is found among the ancients, although their sayings are not to be always implicitly accepted; but wisdom belongs to God as an attribute of His nature, and indeed absolutely, i.e., on every side, and without measure, as the piling up of synonymous expressions implies: &#1495;&#1499;&#1502;&#1492;, which perceives the reason of the nature, and the reality of the existence, of things; &#1506;&#1510;&#1492;, which is never perplexed as to the best way of attaining its purpose; &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492;, which can penetrate to the bottom of what is true and false, sound and corrupt (comp. <a href="/1_kings/3-9.htm">1 Kings 3:9</a>); and also &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492;, which is able to carry out the plans, purposes, and decisions of this wisdom against all hindrance and opposition.<p>In the strophe which follows, from his own observation and from traditional knowledge (<a href="/job/13-1.htm">Job 13:1</a>), Job describes the working of God, as the unsearchably wise and the irresistibly mighty One, both among men and in nature. </body></html>
