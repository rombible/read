It were well if wise and good men, who differ about lesser things, would see how it is for their honour and comfort, and the good of others, to dwell most upon the great things in which they agree. Here are no complaints, or reflections. He gives many instances of God's powerful management of the children of men, overruling all their counsels, and overcoming all their oppositions. Having all strength and wisdom, God knows how to make use, even of those who are foolish and bad; otherwise there is so little wisdom and so little honesty in the world, that all had been in confusion and ruin long ago. These important truths were suited to convince the disputants that they were out of their depth in attempting to assign the Lord's reasons for afflicting Job; his ways are unsearchable, and his judgments past finding out. Let us remark what beautiful illustrations there are in the word of God, confirming his sovereignty, and wisdom in that sovereignty: but the highest and infinitely the most important is, that the Lord Jesus was crucified by the malice of the Jews; and who but the Lord could have known that this one event was the salvation of the world?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>With him is wisdom - Margin, correctly, "God." However much wisdom there may seem to be with aged men, yes the true wisdom - that which was supreme and worthy of the name - was to be found in God alone. The object of Job was to lead the thoughts up to God, and to bring his friends to a contemplation of the wisdom which he manifests in his works. Accordingly he goes on in the remainder of this chapter to state some of the illustrations of wisdom and power which God had exhibited, and particularly to show that he was a sovereign, and did his pleasure every where. He made all things; he sustains all things; he reverses the condition of people at his pleasure; he sets up whom he pleases, and when he chooses he casts them down. His works are contrary in many respects to what we should anticipate; and the sense of all is, that God was a holy and a righteous sovereign, and that such were the reverses under his administration that we could not argue that he treated all according to their character on earth. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. In contrast to, "with the ancient is wisdom" (Job 12:12), Job quotes a saying of the ancients which suits his argument, "with Him (God) is (the true) wisdom" (Pr 8:14); and by that "wisdom and strength" "He breaketh down," &c., as an absolute Sovereign, not allowing man to penetrate His mysteries; man's part is to bow to His unchangeable decrees (Job 1:21).

Not with the ancient and long lived man, but with God, who has made the whole universe, and in whose hand and at whose dispose all creatures are, <a href="/job/12-9.htm">Job 12:9</a>; with him wisdom is originally, essentially, and inderivatively, as the fountain and fulness of it; he is the only and all wise God; his wisdom is displayed in making the world, and all things in it, in the beautiful manner they are set, and in their subserviency to each other; in all the dispensations of his providence, having all a "bathos", a depth of wisdom and knowledge in them, being all according to the counsel of his will; and in the work of redemption and salvation by Christ, in which he has abounded in all wisdom and prudence; in finding out and appointing a Redeemer, mighty and strong, equal to the work; in contriving and bringing it about, in such a manner as to glorify all his perfections; hence the Gospel, which is the publication of this grace, is called the wisdom of God: and with him is wisdom to communicate to his people, to direct them how to behave under every providence, in every station of life, in the church, and in the world, see <a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>; and he has "strength", which he has shown in making the world out of nothing, in upholding it, and all things in it in being, in executing his designs, decrees, and purposes, in fulfilling his promises, and in supporting and strengthening his people, under all their trials and exercises, to withstand every enemy, and perform every duty; ancient men, though they may increase in wisdom, they decline in strength, but God has both, in infinite perfection: <p>he hath counsel and understanding; his decrees and purposes, wisely formed within himself, are his counsels of old, and which are truly and punctually performed in time; his plan of peace, reconciliation, and salvation by Christ, may, with propriety, be called the counsel of peace between them both; and the Gospel, and the various doctrines of it, are the whole counsel of God, and so are the ordinances of it; and besides these, by which he counsels and advises his people, he has counsel with him, and which he gives unto them by his spirit, for which they bless his name; and so even did Christ as man and Mediator, <a href="/psalms/16-7.htm">Psalm 16:7</a>; he has counsel to give, and does give in things temporal, relating to the common affairs of life, and in things concerning the good and welfare of immortal souls; all which comes from him who is "wonderful in counsel, and excellent in working", <a href="/isaiah/28-29.htm">Isaiah 28:29</a>; and he has an "understanding" that is infinite and unsearchable; he has an understanding of himself, his nature, perfections, and persons of all his creatures, and of all things past, present, and to come; the same things are said of Christ, the wisdom of God, <a href="/proverbs/8-14.htm">Proverbs 8:14</a>. Job, having observed these things of God, passes on to discourse most admirably and excellently of the power and wisdom of God in various instances, especially in the dispensations of his providence, by which he appears to have known the secrets of wisdom, and not so ignorant as represented by Zophar. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/12.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">With him is wisdom and strength, he hath counsel and understanding.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/job/12.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">13</span>. <span class="ital">With him is wisdom and strength</span>] i. e. with God, <span class="ital">him</span> being emphatic.

The passage that follows to the end of the chapter describes God’s power and wisdom as their operations had been observed by men, though naturally the picture receives its colour from the state of Job’s mind. “Strength” is rather might or power to execute what wisdom devises.

With God wisdom and strength dwell essentially. He is not wiser or stronger at one time than at another. Time and experience add nothing to the perfection of his attributes, which are unchangeable.

Since, as a glance at what follows shows, Job further on praises God as the governor of the universe, it may be expected that the reference is here to God as the creator and preserver of the world, which seems to be the meaning of the words. Job himself expresses the purpose of this hymn of confession, <a href="/job/12-2.htm">Job 12:2</a>., <a href="/job/13-1.htm">Job 13:1</a>.: he will show the friends that the majesty of God, before which he ought, according to their demands, to humble himself in penitence, is not less known to him than to them; and with &#1493;&#1488;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501;, verum enim vero, he passes over to this subject when he begins his third answer with the following thought: The perception in which you pride yourselves I also possess; true, I am an object of scornful contempt to you, who are as little able to understand the suffering of the godly as the prosperity of the godless, nevertheless what you know I also know: ask now, etc. Bildad had appealed to the sayings of the ancients, which have the long experience of the past in their favour, to support the justice of the divine government; Job here appeals to the absoluteness of the divine rule over creation. In form, this strophe is the counterpart of <a href="//biblehub.com/job/8-8.htm">Job 8:8-10</a> in the speech of Bildad, and somewhat also of <a href="//biblehub.com/job/11-7.htm">Job 11:7-9</a> in that of Zophar. The working of God, which infinitely transcends human power and knowledge, is the sermon which is continuously preached by all created things; they all proclaim the omnipotence and wisdom of the Creator.<p>The plural &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; is followed by the verb that refers to it, in the singular, in favour of which <a href="/genesis/49-22.htm">Genesis 49:22</a> is the favourite example among old expositors (Ges. 146, 3). On the other hand, the verb might follow the collective &#1506;&#1493;&#1507; in the plural, according to Ges. 146, 1. The plural, however, is used only in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/12-8.htm">Job 12:8</a>, because there the verb precedes instead of following its subject. According to the rule Ges. 128, 2, the jussive form of the fut. follows the imperative. In the midst of this enumeration of created things, &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1495;, as a substantive, seems to signify the plants - and especially as Arab. s&#780;&#305;&#770;h even now, in the neighbourhood of Job's ancient habitation, is the name of a well-known mountain-plant - under whose shade a meagre vegetation is preserved even in the hot season (vid., on <a href="/job/30-4.htm">Job 30:4</a>.). But (1) &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1495; as subst. is gen. masc. <a href="/genesis/2-5.htm">Genesis 2:5</a>); (2) instead of &#1500;&#1506;&#1512;&#1509;, in order to describe a plant that is found on the ground, or one rooted in the ground, it must be &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; or &#1489;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;;   (3) the mention of plants between the birds and fishes would be strange. It may therefore be taken as the imperative: speak to the earth (lxx, Targ., Vulg., and most others); or, which I prefer, since the Aramaic construction &#1500;&#1493; &#1505;&#1495;, narravit ei, does not occur elsewhere in Hebrew (although perhaps implicite, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/6-22.htm">Proverbs 6:22</a>, &#1514;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1495;&#1498;  equals  &#1500;&#1498; &#1514;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1495;, favulabitur, or confabulabitur tibi), as a pregnant expression: think, i.e., look meditatively to the earth (Ewald), since &#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; (&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1495;), like &#1492;&#1490;&#1492;, combines the significations of quiet or articulate meditation on a subject. The exhortation directs attention not to the earth in itself, but to the small living things which move about on the ground, comprehended in the collective name &#1512;&#1502;&#1513;&#1474;, syn. &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1509; (creeping things), in the record of creation. All these creatures, though without reason and speech, still utter a language which is heard by every intelligent man. Renan, after Ewald, translates erroneously: qui ne sait parmi tous ces tres. They do not even possess knowledge, but they offer instruction, and are a means of knowledge; &#1489;&#1468; with &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;, like <a href="/genesis/15-8.htm">Genesis 15:8</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/42-33.htm">Genesis 42:33</a>, and freq. All the creatures named declare that the hand of Jehovah has made "this," whatever we see around us, &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, <a href="/hebrews/11-3.htm">Hebrews 11:3</a>. In the same manner in <a href="/isaiah/66-2.htm">Isaiah 66:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-22.htm">Jeremiah 14:22</a>, &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; is used of the world around us. In the hand of God, i.e., in His power, because His workmanship, are the souls of all living things, and the spirit (that which came direct from God) of all men; every order of life, high and low, owes its origin and continuance to Him. &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; is the individual, and in this connection, in which &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; and &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; ( equals  &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1492;) are certainly not unintentionally thus separated, the individual man. Creation is the school of knowledge, and man is the learner. And this knowledge forces itself upon one's attention: quis non cognoverit? The perf. has this subjunctive force also elsewhere in interrogative clauses, e.g., <a href="/psalms/11-3.htm">Psalm 11:3</a> (vid., on <a href="/genesis/21-7.htm">Genesis 21:7</a>). That the name of God, JEHOVAH, for once escapes the poet here, is to be explained from the phrase "the hand of Jehovah hath made this," being a somewhat proverbial expression (comp. <a href="/isaiah/41-20.htm">Isaiah 41:20</a>; <a href="/isaiah/66-2.htm">Isaiah 66:2</a>).<p>Job now refers to the sayings of the fathers, the authority of which, as being handed down from past generations, Bildad had maintained in his opposition to Job. </body></html>
