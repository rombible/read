It were well if wise and good men, who differ about lesser things, would see how it is for their honour and comfort, and the good of others, to dwell most upon the great things in which they agree. Here are no complaints, or reflections. He gives many instances of God's powerful management of the children of men, overruling all their counsels, and overcoming all their oppositions. Having all strength and wisdom, God knows how to make use, even of those who are foolish and bad; otherwise there is so little wisdom and so little honesty in the world, that all had been in confusion and ruin long ago. These important truths were suited to convince the disputants that they were out of their depth in attempting to assign the Lord's reasons for afflicting Job; his ways are unsearchable, and his judgments past finding out. Let us remark what beautiful illustrations there are in the word of God, confirming his sovereignty, and wisdom in that sovereignty: but the highest and infinitely the most important is, that the Lord Jesus was crucified by the malice of the Jews; and who but the Lord could have known that this one event was the salvation of the world?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He leadeth counsellors away spoiled - Plundered or captive. That is, the counsels of wise and great men do not avail against God. Statesmen who promised themselves victory as the result of their plans he disappoints, and leads away into captivity. The object of this is to show that God is superior over all, and also that people are not dealt with in exact accordance with their character and rank. God is a sovereign, and he shows his sovereignty when defeating the counsels and purposes of the wisest of men, and overturning the plans of the mighty.<p>And maketh the judges fools - He leaves them to distracted and foolish plans. He leaves them to the adoption of measures which result in their own ruin. He is a sovereign, having control over the minds of the great, and power to defeat all their counsels, and to render them infatuated. Nothing can be clearer than this. Nothing has been more frequently illustrated in the history of nations. In accordance with this belief is the well-known expression:<p>Quem Deus vult perdere prius dementat.<p>"Whom God purposes to destroy, he first infatuates." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16.

So far Job recognises the authority of these traditional sayings. At any rate, he adds (<a href="/job/12-12.htm">Job 12:12</a>): wisdom is to be expected from the hoary-headed, and length of life is understanding, i.e., it accompanies length of life. "Length of days" may thus be taken as the subject (Ewald, Olsh.); but &#1489;&#1468; may also, with the old translations and expositors, be carried forward from the preceding clause: &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#837; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b7; (lxx). We prefer, as the most natural: long life is a school of understanding. But - such is the antithesis in <a href="/job/12-13.htm">Job 12:13</a> which belongs to this strophe - the highest possessor of wisdom, as of might, is God. Ewald inserts two self-made couplets before <a href="//biblehub.com/job/12-12.htm">Job 12:12</a>, which in his opinion are required both by the connection and "the structure of the strophe;" we see as little need for this interpolation here as before, <a href="/job/6-14.htm">Job 6:14</a>. &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493; and &#1500;&#1493;, which are placed first for the sake of emphasis, manifestly introduce an antithesis; and it is evident from the antithesis, that the One who is placed in contrast to the many men of experience is God. Wisdom is found among the ancients, although their sayings are not to be always implicitly accepted; but wisdom belongs to God as an attribute of His nature, and indeed absolutely, i.e., on every side, and without measure, as the piling up of synonymous expressions implies: &#1495;&#1499;&#1502;&#1492;, which perceives the reason of the nature, and the reality of the existence, of things; &#1506;&#1510;&#1492;, which is never perplexed as to the best way of attaining its purpose; &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492;, which can penetrate to the bottom of what is true and false, sound and corrupt (comp. <a href="/1_kings/3-9.htm">1 Kings 3:9</a>); and also &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492;, which is able to carry out the plans, purposes, and decisions of this wisdom against all hindrance and opposition.<p>In the strophe which follows, from his own observation and from traditional knowledge (<a href="/job/13-1.htm">Job 13:1</a>), Job describes the working of God, as the unsearchably wise and the irresistibly mighty One, both among men and in nature. </body></html>
