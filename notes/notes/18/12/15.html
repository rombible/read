It were well if wise and good men, who differ about lesser things, would see how it is for their honour and comfort, and the good of others, to dwell most upon the great things in which they agree. Here are no complaints, or reflections. He gives many instances of God's powerful management of the children of men, overruling all their counsels, and overcoming all their oppositions. Having all strength and wisdom, God knows how to make use, even of those who are foolish and bad; otherwise there is so little wisdom and so little honesty in the world, that all had been in confusion and ruin long ago. These important truths were suited to convince the disputants that they were out of their depth in attempting to assign the Lord's reasons for afflicting Job; his ways are unsearchable, and his judgments past finding out. Let us remark what beautiful illustrations there are in the word of God, confirming his sovereignty, and wisdom in that sovereignty: but the highest and infinitely the most important is, that the Lord Jesus was crucified by the malice of the Jews; and who but the Lord could have known that this one event was the salvation of the world?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He withholdeth the waters - From the clouds and springs. He has control over the rains and the fountains; and when these are withheld, rivers and lakes become dry. The Syriac renders this, - "if he rebuke the waters," supposing that there might perhaps be an allusion to the drying up of the Red Sea, or the formation of a passage for the Israelites. But it is remarkable that in the argument here there is no allusion to any historical fact, not to the flood, or to the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, or to the passage through the Red Sea, though these occurrences would have furnished so appropriate illustrations of the points under discussion. Is it to be inferred that Job had never heard of any of those events? Or may it have been that the lessons which they were adapted to teach had been actually embodied in the proverbs which he was using, and furnished well-known illustrations or the basis of such apothegms?<p>He sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth - Such inundations may have occurred in the swollen torrents of Arabia, and indeed are so common everywhere as to furnish a striking illustration of the power and sovereign agency of God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15.

Or "lays a restraint in" or "on the waters" (s); either in the ocean, as he did at the creation, when he gathered the waters that were upon the face of the earth into one place, and restrained them there, even in the decreed place he broke up for them, called the sea, and set bars and doors to keep them within bounds, whereby the places they left became dry and the dry land appeared called earth; and so at the time of the flood, when the waters which covered the earth and drowned the world were called off again, the face of it was dry, and so it remains, the waters of the great ocean being restrained from overflowing it; and also when God rebukes the see, and smites the waves of it, or withholds the ebbing and flowing of the tides brooks and rivers of water dry up; see <a href="/nahum/1-4.htm">Nahum 1:4</a>; or else this may be understood of God's withholding and restraining the waters in the clouds, and not suffering them to let down rain on the earth; when not only brooks dry up, as the brook Cherith did, where Elijah abode for sometime, but the fruits of the earth, trees, plants, and herbs dry up, wither and die; see <a href="/1_kings/17-7.htm">1 Kings 17:7</a>; and this is an emblem in a spiritual sense of God's withholding the word and ordinances, the waters of the sanctuary the means of grace, and of fruitfulness; which when he does, the consequence of it is barrenness and unfruitfulness in kingdoms, cities, towns, families, sad particular persons; and of his withholding the communications of his grace, often compared to water in Scripture, even from his people; the effect of which is, that they are in, withering circumstances, the things that revive seem ready to die, though they shall not; love waxes cold, faith is ready to fail, and hope and strength seem perishing from the Lord: <p>also he sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth; as at the time of the flood, when the fountains of the great deep were broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened, and such vast quantities of water issued out as overflowed the whole world, by which it was overturned; and as the Apostle Peter says, "perished", <a href="/2_peter/3-5.htm">2 Peter 3:5</a>; though this is also true of inundations that may have been since, which though not universal as that, yet so far as they have reached have overturned all in their way, and carried off the fruits of the earth, the habitations of men, and men themselves; whole countries, cities and towns, have been carried away by the waters of the sea, or sunk into it, particularly all that space. Where now is the Atlantic sea, as Pliny (t), from Plato, relates. It is well when the grace of God flows, and overflows, and superabounds abounding sin, and overpowers and overcomes carnal, earthly, and sensual lusts, and reigns where sin did, and teaches to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts, and to mortify the members on the earth. <p>(s)  "detinebit in aquis", Montanus, Bolducius; "si contineat, vel cohibeat, q. d. imperium exerceat in aquas", Michaelis.

Once upon a time he overwhelmed the whole earth, and destroyed almost the entire race of mankind, by a deluge of an extraordinary character, which so fixed itself in the human consciousness, that traces of it are to be found in the traditions of almost all the various races of men. But, beside this great occasion, he also in ten thousand other cases, causes, by means of floods, tremendous ruin and devastation, sweeping away crops and cattle, and even villages and cities, sometimes even "overturning the earth," causing lakes to burst, rivers to change their course, vast tracts of land to be permanently submerged, and the contour of coasts to be altered. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>  7  But ask now even the beasts - they shall teach it thee;<p>And the birds of heaven - they shall declare it to thee:<p>  8  Or look thoughtfully to the ground - it shall teach it thee;<p>And the fish of the sea shall tell it thee.<p>  9  Who would not recognise in all this<p>That the hand of Jehovah hath wrought this,<p>10  In whose hand is the soul of every living thing,<p>And the breath of all mankind?!<p>The meaning of the whole strophe is perverted if &#1494;&#1488;&#1514; (<a href="/job/12-9.htm">Job 12:9</a>), is, with Ewald, referred to "the destiny of severe suffering and pain," and if that which precedes is accordingly referred to the testimony of creation to God as its author. Since, as a glance at what follows shows, Job further on praises God as the governor of the universe, it may be expected that the reference is here to God as the creator and preserver of the world, which seems to be the meaning of the words. Job himself expresses the purpose of this hymn of confession, <a href="/job/12-2.htm">Job 12:2</a>., <a href="/job/13-1.htm">Job 13:1</a>.: he will show the friends that the majesty of God, before which he ought, according to their demands, to humble himself in penitence, is not less known to him than to them; and with &#1493;&#1488;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501;, verum enim vero, he passes over to this subject when he begins his third answer with the following thought: The perception in which you pride yourselves I also possess; true, I am an object of scornful contempt to you, who are as little able to understand the suffering of the godly as the prosperity of the godless, nevertheless what you know I also know: ask now, etc. Bildad had appealed to the sayings of the ancients, which have the long experience of the past in their favour, to support the justice of the divine government; Job here appeals to the absoluteness of the divine rule over creation. In form, this strophe is the counterpart of <a href="//biblehub.com/job/8-8.htm">Job 8:8-10</a> in the speech of Bildad, and somewhat also of <a href="//biblehub.com/job/11-7.htm">Job 11:7-9</a> in that of Zophar. The working of God, which infinitely transcends human power and knowledge, is the sermon which is continuously preached by all created things; they all proclaim the omnipotence and wisdom of the Creator.<p>The plural &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; is followed by the verb that refers to it, in the singular, in favour of which <a href="/genesis/49-22.htm">Genesis 49:22</a> is the favourite example among old expositors (Ges. 146, 3). On the other hand, the verb might follow the collective &#1506;&#1493;&#1507; in the plural, according to Ges. 146, 1. The plural, however, is used only in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/12-8.htm">Job 12:8</a>, because there the verb precedes instead of following its subject. According to the rule Ges. 128, 2, the jussive form of the fut. follows the imperative. In the midst of this enumeration of created things, &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1495;, as a substantive, seems to signify the plants - and especially as Arab. s&#780;&#305;&#770;h even now, in the neighbourhood of Job's ancient habitation, is the name of a well-known mountain-plant - under whose shade a meagre vegetation is preserved even in the hot season (vid., on <a href="/job/30-4.htm">Job 30:4</a>.). But (1) &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1495; as subst. is gen. masc. <a href="/genesis/2-5.htm">Genesis 2:5</a>); (2) instead of &#1500;&#1506;&#1512;&#1509;, in order to describe a plant that is found on the ground, or one rooted in the ground, it must be &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; or &#1489;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;;   (3) the mention of plants between the birds and fishes would be strange. It may therefore be taken as the imperative: speak to the earth (lxx, Targ., Vulg., and most others); or, which I prefer, since the Aramaic construction &#1500;&#1493; &#1505;&#1495;, narravit ei, does not occur elsewhere in Hebrew (although perhaps implicite, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/6-22.htm">Proverbs 6:22</a>, &#1514;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1495;&#1498;  equals  &#1500;&#1498; &#1514;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1495;, favulabitur, or confabulabitur tibi), as a pregnant expression: think, i.e., look meditatively to the earth (Ewald), since &#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; (&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1495;), like &#1492;&#1490;&#1492;, combines the significations of quiet or articulate meditation on a subject. The exhortation directs attention not to the earth in itself, but to the small living things which move about on the ground, comprehended in the collective name &#1512;&#1502;&#1513;&#1474;, syn. &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1509; (creeping things), in the record of creation. All these creatures, though without reason and speech, still utter a language which is heard by every intelligent man. Renan, after Ewald, translates erroneously: qui ne sait parmi tous ces tres. They do not even possess knowledge, but they offer instruction, and are a means of knowledge; &#1489;&#1468; with &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;, like <a href="/genesis/15-8.htm">Genesis 15:8</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/42-33.htm">Genesis 42:33</a>, and freq. All the creatures named declare that the hand of Jehovah has made "this," whatever we see around us, &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, <a href="/hebrews/11-3.htm">Hebrews 11:3</a>. In the same manner in <a href="/isaiah/66-2.htm">Isaiah 66:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-22.htm">Jeremiah 14:22</a>, &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; is used of the world around us. In the hand of God, i.e., in His power, because His workmanship, are the souls of all living things, and the spirit (that which came direct from God) of all men; every order of life, high and low, owes its origin and continuance to Him. &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; is the individual, and in this connection, in which &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; and &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; ( equals  &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1492;) are certainly not unintentionally thus separated, the individual man. Creation is the school of knowledge, and man is the learner. And this knowledge forces itself upon one's attention: quis non cognoverit? The perf. has this subjunctive force also elsewhere in interrogative clauses, e.g., <a href="/psalms/11-3.htm">Psalm 11:3</a> (vid., on <a href="/genesis/21-7.htm">Genesis 21:7</a>). That the name of God, JEHOVAH, for once escapes the poet here, is to be explained from the phrase "the hand of Jehovah hath made this," being a somewhat proverbial expression (comp. <a href="/isaiah/41-20.htm">Isaiah 41:20</a>; <a href="/isaiah/66-2.htm">Isaiah 66:2</a>).<p>Job now refers to the sayings of the fathers, the authority of which, as being handed down from past generations, Bildad had maintained in his opposition to Job. </body></html>
