It were well if wise and good men, who differ about lesser things, would see how it is for their honour and comfort, and the good of others, to dwell most upon the great things in which they agree. Here are no complaints, or reflections. He gives many instances of God's powerful management of the children of men, overruling all their counsels, and overcoming all their oppositions. Having all strength and wisdom, God knows how to make use, even of those who are foolish and bad; otherwise there is so little wisdom and so little honesty in the world, that all had been in confusion and ruin long ago. These important truths were suited to convince the disputants that they were out of their depth in attempting to assign the Lord's reasons for afflicting Job; his ways are unsearchable, and his judgments past finding out. Let us remark what beautiful illustrations there are in the word of God, confirming his sovereignty, and wisdom in that sovereignty: but the highest and infinitely the most important is, that the Lord Jesus was crucified by the malice of the Jews; and who but the Lord could have known that this one event was the salvation of the world?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He taketh away the heart - The word heart here evidently means mind, intelligence, wisdom; see the notes at <a href="/job/12-3.htm">Job 12:3</a>.<p>Of the chief of the people - Hebrew "Heads of the people;" that is, of the rulers of the earth.

We find echoes of this utterance respecting God's paradoxical rule in the world in <a href="/isaiah/40-23.htm">Isaiah 40:23</a>; <a href="/isaiah/44-25.htm">Isaiah 44:25</a>; and Isaiah's oracle on Egypt, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/19-11.htm">Job 19:11-15</a>, furnishes an illustration in the reality.<p>It is but too natural to translate <a href="/job/12-18.htm">Job 12:18</a> : the bands of kings He looses (after <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/116-16.htm">Psalm 116:16</a>, &#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1505;&#1512;&#1497; &#1508;&#1514;&#1495;&#1514;, Thou hast loosed my bands); but the relation of the two parts of the verse can then not be this: He unchains and chains kings (Hirz., Ew., Heiligst.

The English translation is correct: He looseth the authority of kings. The antithesis is certainly lost, but the thoughts here moreover flow on in synonymous parallelism.</body></html>
