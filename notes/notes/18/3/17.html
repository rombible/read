No creature comes into the world so helpless as man. God's power and providence upheld our frail lives, and his pity and patience spared our forfeited lives. Natural affection is put into parents' hearts by God. To desire to die that we may be with Christ, that we may be free from sin, is the effect and evidence of grace; but to desire to die, only that we may be delivered from the troubles of this life, savours of corruption. It is our wisdom and duty to make the best of that which is, be it living or dying; and so to live to the Lord, and die to the Lord, as in both to be his, Ro 14:8. Observe how Job describes the repose of the grave; There the wicked cease from troubling. When persecutors die, they can no longer persecute. There the weary are at rest: in the grave they rest from all their labours. And a rest from sin, temptation, conflict, sorrows, and labours, remains in the presence and enjoyment of God. There believers rest in Jesus, nay, as far as we trust in the Lord Jesus and obey him, we here find rest to our souls, though in the world we have tribulation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>There the wicked cease - from "troubling." In the grave - where kings and princes and infants lie. This verse is often applied to heaven, and the language is such as will express the condition of that blessed world. But as used by Job it had no such reference. It relates only to the grave. It is language which beautifully expresses the condition of the dead, and the "desirableness" even of an abode in the tomb. They who are there, are free from the vexations and annoyances to which people are exposed in this life. The wicked cannot torture their limbs by the fires of persecution, or wound their feelings by slander, or oppress and harass them in regard to their property, or distress them by thwarting their plans, or injure them by impugnlug their motives. All is peaceful and calm in the grave, and "there" is a place where the malicious designs of wicked people cannot reach us. The object of this verse and the two following is! to show the "reasons" why it was desirable to be in the grave, rather than to live and to suffer the ills of this life. We are not to suppose that Job referred exclusively to his own case in all this. tie is describing, in general, the happy condition of the dead, and we have no reason to think that he had been particularly annoyed by wicked people. But the pious often are, and hence, it should be a matter of gratitude that there is one place, at least, where the wicked cannot annoy the good; and where the persecuted, the oppressed, and the slandered may lie down in peace.<p>And there the weary be at rest - Margin, "Wearied in strength." The margin is in accordance with the Hebrew. The meaning is, those whose strength is exhausted; who are worn down by the toils and eares of life, and who feel the need of rest. Never was more beautiful language employed than occurs in this verse. What a charm such language throws even over the grave - like strewing flowers, and planting roses around the tomb! Who should fear to die, if prepared, when such is to be the condition of the dead? Who is there that is not in some way troubled by the wicked - by their thoughtless, ungodly life; by persecution, contempt, and slander? compare <a href="/2_peter/2-8.htm">2 Peter 2:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/39-1.htm">Psalm 39:1</a>. Who is there that is not at some time weary with his load of care, anxiety, and trouble? Who is there whose strength does not become exhausted, and to whom rest is not grateful and refreshing? And who is there, therefore, to whom, if prepared for heaven, the grave would not be a place of calm and grateful rest? And though true religion will not prompt us to wish that we had lain down there in early childhood, as Job wished, yet no dictate of piety is violated when "we" look forward with calm delight to the time when we may repose where the wicked cease from troubling, and where the weary be at rest. O grave, thou art a peaceful spot! Thy rest is calm: thy slumbers are sweet.<p>Nor pain, nor grief, nor anxious fear<p>Invade thy bounds. No mortal woes<p>Can reach the peaceful sleeper here,<p>While angels watch the soft repose.<p>So Jesus slept; God's dying Son<p>Passed through the grave, and blest the bed. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17. the wicked&#8212;the original meaning, "those ever restless," "full of desires" (Isa 57:20, 21).<p>the weary&#8212;literally, "those whose strength is wearied out" (Re 14:13).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/job/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">There, </span> i.e. in the grave, which though not expressed, yet is clearly implied in the foregoing verses. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The wicked cease from troubling; </span> the great oppressors and troublers of the world cease from all those vexations, rapines, and murders which here they procured. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">There the weary be at rest; </span> those who were here molested and tired out with their tyrannies, now quietly sleep with them, or by them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/job/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>There the wicked cease from troubling,....
