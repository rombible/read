The permission seems to have extended to this, as well as to torturing the body. Job was an especial type of Christ, whose inward sufferings, both in the garden and on the cross, were the most dreadful; and arose in a great degree from the assaults of Satan in that hour of darkness. These inward trials show the reason of the change that took place in Job's conduct, from entire submission to the will of God, to the impatience which appears here, and in other parts of the book. The believer, who knows that a few drops of this bitter cup are more dreadful than the sharpest outward afflictions, while he is favoured with a sweet sense of the love and presence of God, will not be surprised to find that Job proved a man of like passions with others; but will rejoice that Satan was disappointed, and could not prove him a hypocrite; for though he cursed the day of his birth, he did not curse his God. Job doubtless was afterwards ashamed of these wishes, and we may suppose what must be his judgment of them now he is in everlasting happiness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And Job spake - Margin, as in Hebrew, "answered." The Hebrew word used here &#1506;&#1504;&#1492;  &#8219;a&#770;na&#770;h "to answer," is often employed when one commences a discourse, even though no question had preceded. It is somewhat in the sense of replying to a subject, or of speaking in a case where a question might appropriately be asked; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/14.htm">Isaiah 14</a>:(Hebrew), <a href="/zechariah/3-4.htm">Zechariah 3:4</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/26-5.htm">Deuteronomy 26:5</a> (Hebrew), <a href="/deuteronomy/27-14.htm">Deuteronomy 27:14</a> (Hebrew).

His outburst is singularly wild and bold (Jer 20:14). To desire to die so as to be free from sin is a mark of grace; to desire to die so as to escape troubles is a mark of corruption. He was ill-fitted to die who was so unwilling to live. But his trials were greater, and his light less, than ours.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/job/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/job/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Job spake, and said. Or "answered and said" (t), though not a word was spoken to him by his friends; he answered to his own calamity, and to their silence, as Schmidt observes; and this word is sometimes used when nothing goes before, to which the answer is, as many Jewish writers observe, as in <a href="/exodus/32-27.htm">Exodus 32:27</a>; Jarchi interprets it, "he cried", and so some others (u) render it: from henceforwards to <a href="//biblehub.com/job/42-6.htm">Job 42:6</a>, this book is written in a poetical style, in Hebrew metre as is thought, which at present is pretty much unknown, even to the Jews themselves; some have been of opinion, that the following discourses between Job and his friends were not originally delivered in metre, but were put into this form by the penman or writer of the book; but of this we cannot be certain; in the Targum in the king of Spain's Bible it is, "and Job sung and said". <p>(t) "et respondit", Pagninus, Montanus, Schmidt, Schultens, Michaelis.

An idle wish, doubtless; the vague utterance of extreme despair. Days cannot perish, or, at any rate, one day cannot perish more than another. They all come, and then are gone; but no day can perish out of the year, which will always have its full complement of three hundred and sixty-five days till time shall be no more. But extreme despair does not reason. It simply gives utterance to the thoughts and wishes as they arise. Job knew that many of his thoughts were vain and foolish, and confesses it further on (see <a href="/job/6-3.htm">Job 6:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And the night in which it was said</span>; rather, <span class="accented">which said.</span> Day and night are, both of them, personified, as in <a href="/psalms/19-2.htm">Psalm 19:2</a>. <span class="cmt_word">There is a man child conceived</span>.

The few words as they stand are sufficiently characteristic. They are not to be explained, Call on God for the last time, and then die (von Gerl.); or, Call on Him that thou die (according to Ges. 130, 2); but &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; signifies, as Job's answer shows, to take leave of. She therefore counsels Job to do that which Satan has boasted to accomplish. And notwithstanding, Hengstenberg, in his Lecture on the Book of Job (1860), <p>(Note: Clark's Foreign Theological Library.)<p>defends her against the too severe judgment of expositors. Her desperation, says he, proceeds from her strong love for her husband; and if she had to suffer the same herself, she would probably have struggled against despair. But love hopeth all things; love keeps its despondency hidden even when it desponds; love has no such godless utterance, as to say, Renounce God; and none so unloving, as to say, Die. No, indeed! this woman is truly diaboli adjutrix (August.); a tool of the temper (Ebrard); impiae carnis praeco (Brentius). And though Calvin goes too far when he calls her not only organum Satanae, but even Proserpinam et Furiam infernalem, the title of another Xantippe, against which Hengstenberg defends her, is indeed rather flattery than slander. Tobias' Anna is her copy.<p>(Note: She says to the blind Tobias, when she is obliged to work for the support of the family, and does not act straightforwardly towards him: &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#788; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#788; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;, &#x3b9;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768; &#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;, i.e., (as Sengelmann, Book of Tobit, 1857, and O. F. Fritzsche, Handbuch zu d. Apokr. Lief. ii. S. 36, correctly explain) one sees from thy misfortunes that thy virtue is not of much avail to thee. She appears still more like Job in the revised text: manifeste vana facta est spes tua et eleemosynae tuae modo apparuerunt, i.e., thy benevolence has obviously brought us to poverty. In the text of Jerome a parallel between Tobias and Job precedes this utterance of Tobias' wife.)<p>What experience of life and insight the writer manifests in introducing Job's wife as the mocking opposer of his constant piety! Job has lost his children, but this wife he has retained, for he needed not to be tried by losing her: he was proved sufficiently by having her. She is further on once referred to, but even then not to her advantage. Why, asks Chrysostom, did the devil leave him this wife? Because he thought her a good scourge, by which to plague him more acutely than by any other means. Moreover, the thought is not far distant, that God left her to him in order that when, in the glorious issue of his sufferings, he receives everything doubled, he might not have this thorn in the flesh also doubled.<p>(Note: The delicate design of the writer here must not be overlooked: it has something of the tragi-comic about it, and has furnished acceptable material for epigrammatic writers not first from Kstner, but from early times (vid., das Epigramm vom J. 1696, in Serpilius' Personalia Iobi). Vid., a Jewish proverb relating thereto in Tendlau, Sprchw. u. Redensarten deutsch-jd. Vorzeit (1860), S. 11.)<p>What enmity towards God, what uncharitableness towards her husband, is there in her sarcastic words, which, if they are more than mockery, counsel him to suicide! (Ebrard). But he repels them in a manner becoming himself. </body></html>
