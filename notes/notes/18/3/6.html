Thus, as Job had thrown out his resentment against the day in which he was both, so now the severity of his censure falls on his birth-right; and his style, we find, increases and grows stronger. Our translation, indeed, makes no difference in the expression of darkness; namely, “Let that day be darkness; as for that night, let darkness seize upon it.” But the Hebrew is very different: for <span class="greekheb">חשׁךְ</span>, <span class="ital">choshec, </span>is applied to the day, and <span class="greekheb">אפל</span>, <span class="ital">ophel, </span>to the night, which latter word signifies a much greater degree of darkness than the former.

The permission seems to have extended to this, as well as to torturing the body. Job was an especial type of Christ, whose inward sufferings, both in the garden and on the cross, were the most dreadful; and arose in a great degree from the assaults of Satan in that hour of darkness. These inward trials show the reason of the change that took place in Job's conduct, from entire submission to the will of God, to the impatience which appears here, and in other parts of the book. The believer, who knows that a few drops of this bitter cup are more dreadful than the sharpest outward afflictions, while he is favoured with a sweet sense of the love and presence of God, will not be surprised to find that Job proved a man of like passions with others; but will rejoice that Satan was disappointed, and could not prove him a hypocrite; for though he cursed the day of his birth, he did not curse his God. Job doubtless was afterwards ashamed of these wishes, and we may suppose what must be his judgment of them now he is in everlasting happiness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>As for "that night." Job, having cursed the day, proceeds to utter a malediction on the "night" also; see <a href="/job/3-3.htm">Job 3:3</a>. This malediction extends to <a href="/job/3-9.htm">Job 3:9</a>.<p>Let darkness seize upon it - Hebrew, Let it take it. Let deep and horrid darkness seize it as its own. Let no star arise upon it; let it be unbroken and uninterrupted gloom. The word "darkness," however, does not quite express the force of the original. The word used here &#1488;&#1508;&#1500;  'o&#770;phel is poetic, and denotes darkness more intense than is denoted by the word which is usually rendered "darkness" &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498;  cho&#770;shek. It is a darkness accompanied with clouds and with a tempest. Herder understands it as meaning, that darkness should seize upon that night and bear it away, so that it should not be joined to the months of the year. So the Chaldee. But the true sense is, that Job wished so deep darkness to possess it, that no star would rise upon it; no light whatever be seen. A night like this Seneca beautifully describes in Agamemnon, verses 465ff:<p>Nox prima coeltum sparserat stellis,<p>Cum subito luna conditur, stellae cadunt;<p>In astra pontus tollitur, et coelum petit.<p>Nec una nox est, densa tenebras obruit<p>Caligo, et Omni luce subducta, fretum<p>Coelumque miscet ...<p>Premunt tenebrae lumina, et dirae stygis<p>Inferna nox est.<p>Let it not be joined unto the days of the year - Margin, "rejoice among." So Good and Noyes render it. The word used here &#1497;&#1495;&#1491;  y&#305;&#770;chad, according to the present pointing, is the apocopated future of &#1495;&#1491;&#1492;  cha&#772;da&#770;h, "to rejoice, to be glad." If the pointing were different &#1497;&#1495;&#1491;  ya&#770;chad it would be the future of &#1497;&#1495;&#1491;  yachad, to be one; to be united, or joined to. The Masoretic points are of no authority, and the interpretation which supposes that the word means here to exult or rejoice, is more poetical and beautiful. It is then a representation of the days of the year as rejoicing together, and a wish is expressed that "that" night might never be allowed to partake of the general joy while the months rolled around. In this interpretation Rosenmuller and Gesenius concur. Dodwell supposes that there is an allusion to a custom among the ancients, by which inauspicious days were stricken from the calendar, and their place supplied by intercalary days. But there is no evidence of the existence of snell a custom in the time of Job.<p>Let it not come etc - Let it never be reckoned among the days which go to make up the number of the months.

But their long silence shows that they had not fully realized the purpose of their visit. Their feeling is overpowered by reflection, their sympathy by dismay. It is a pity that they let Job utter the first word, which they might have prevented by some word of kindly solace; for, becoming first fully conscious of the difference between his present and former position from their conduct, he breaks forth with curses. </body></html>
