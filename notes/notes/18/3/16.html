No creature comes into the world so helpless as man. God's power and providence upheld our frail lives, and his pity and patience spared our forfeited lives. Natural affection is put into parents' hearts by God. To desire to die that we may be with Christ, that we may be free from sin, is the effect and evidence of grace; but to desire to die, only that we may be delivered from the troubles of this life, savours of corruption. It is our wisdom and duty to make the best of that which is, be it living or dying; and so to live to the Lord, and die to the Lord, as in both to be his, Ro 14:8. Observe how Job describes the repose of the grave; There the wicked cease from troubling. When persecutors die, they can no longer persecute. There the weary are at rest: in the grave they rest from all their labours. And a rest from sin, temptation, conflict, sorrows, and labours, remains in the presence and enjoyment of God. There believers rest in Jesus, nay, as far as we trust in the Lord Jesus and obey him, we here find rest to our souls, though in the world we have tribulation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Or as an hidden untimely birth - As an abortion which is hid, or concealed; that is, which is soon removed from the sight. So the Psalmist, <a href="/psalms/58-8.htm">Psalm 58:8</a> :<p>As a snail which melteth, let thom dissolve;<p>As the untimely birth of a woman, that they may not see the sun.<p>Septuagint &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;  ektro&#772;ma, the same word which is used by Paul in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-8.htm">1 Corinthians 15:8</a>, with reference to himself; see the notes at that place.<p>I had not been - I should have perished; I should not have been a man, as I now am, subject to calamity. The meaning is, that he would have been taken away and concealed, as such an untimely birth is, and that he would never have been numbered among the living and the suffering.<p>As infants which never saw light - Job expresses here no opinion of their future condition, or on the question whether such infants had immortal souls. He is simply saying that his lot would have been as theirs was, and that he would have been saved from the sorrows which he now experienced. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16. untimely birth&#8212;(Ps 58:8); preferable to the life of the restless miser (Ec 6:3-5).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/job/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Hidden; </span> undiscerned and unregarded. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Untimely birth; </span> born before the due time, and therefore extinct. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I had not been, </span> to wit, in the land of the living, of which he here speaketh. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">As infants which never saw light; </span> being stifled and dead before they were born. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/job/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Or as an hidden untimely birth,.... Or "hid, as one born out of time", as Mr. Broughton reads it; the Septuagint use the same word as the apostle does, when he says the like of himself, <a href="/1_corinthians/15-8.htm">1 Corinthians 15:8</a>; the word has the signification of "falling" (s), and designs an abortive, which is like to fruit that falls from the tree before it is ripe; and this may be said to be "hidden", either in the belly, as the Targum, or however from the sight of man, it being not come to any proper shape, and much less perfection; now Job suggests, that if he had not lain with kings, counsellors, and princes, yet at least he should have been as an abortion, and that would have been as well to him: then <p>I had not been; or should have been nothing, not reckoned anything; should not have been numbered among beings, but accounted as a nonentity, and should have had no subsistence or standing in the world at all: <p>as infants which never saw light; and if not like an untimely birth, which is not come to any perfection, yet should have been like infants, which, though their mothers have gone their full time with them, and they have all their limbs in perfection and proportion, yet are dead, or stillborn, their eyes have never been opened to see any light; meaning not the light of the law, as the Targum, but the light of the sun, or the light of the world, see <a href="/ecclesiastes/6-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:3</a>; infants used to be buried in the wells or caves of the mummies (t). <p>(s) "sicut abortivus qui ex utero excidit, aut in terram cadit", Michaelis.

With strong revulsion from the anguish of life Job desires even if possible a deeper death than to have died when born, even the death of having been dead born, scarcely to be distinguished from non-existence itself. Comp. <a href="/context/ecclesiastes/4-2.htm" title="Why I praised the dead which are already dead more than the living which are yet alive....">Ecclesiastes 4:2-3</a>, with Plumptre’s notes and citations from the classics.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants which never saw light</span>. This is added as another way in which Job might have escaped his misery. Though conceived and brought to the birth, he might have been still-born, and so have known no suffering. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>10  Because it did not close the doors of my mother's womb,<p>Nor hid sorrow from my eyes.<p>11  Why did I not die from the womb,<p>Come forth from the womb and expire?<p>12  Why have the knees welcomed me?<p>And why the breasts, that I should suck?<p>The whole strophe contains strong reason for his cursing the night of his conception or birth. It should rather have closed (i.e., make the womb barren, to be explained according to <a href="/1_samuel/1-5.htm">1 Samuel 1:5</a>; <a href="/genesis/16-2.htm">Genesis 16:2</a>) the doors of his womb (i.e., the womb that conceived concepit him), and so have withdrawn the sorrow he now experiences from his unborn eyes (on the extended force of the negative, vid., Ges. 152, 3). Then why, i.e., to what purpose worth the labour, is he then conceived and born? The four questions, <a href="/job/3-11.htm">Job 3:11</a>., form a climax: he follows the course of his life from its commencement in embryo (&#1502;&#1512;&#1492;&#1501;, to be explained according to <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-17.htm">Jeremiah 20:17</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/job/10-18.htm">Job 10:18</a>, where, however, it is &#1502;&#1503; local, not as here, temporal) to the birth, and from the joy of his father who took the new-born child upon his knees (comp. <a href="/genesis/50-23.htm">Genesis 50:23</a>) to the first development of the infant, and he curses this growing life in its four phases (Arnh., Schlottm.). Observe the consecutio temp. The fut. &#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; has the signification moriebar, because taken from the thought of the first period of his conception and birth; so also &#1493;&#1488;&#1490;&#1493;&#1506;, governed by the preceding perf., the signification et exspirabam (Ges. 127, 4, c).
