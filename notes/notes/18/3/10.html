The permission seems to have extended to this, as well as to torturing the body. Job was an especial type of Christ, whose inward sufferings, both in the garden and on the cross, were the most dreadful; and arose in a great degree from the assaults of Satan in that hour of darkness. These inward trials show the reason of the change that took place in Job's conduct, from entire submission to the will of God, to the impatience which appears here, and in other parts of the book. The believer, who knows that a few drops of this bitter cup are more dreadful than the sharpest outward afflictions, while he is favoured with a sweet sense of the love and presence of God, will not be surprised to find that Job proved a man of like passions with others; but will rejoice that Satan was disappointed, and could not prove him a hypocrite; for though he cursed the day of his birth, he did not curse his God. Job doubtless was afterwards ashamed of these wishes, and we may suppose what must be his judgment of them now he is in everlasting happiness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Because it shut not up ... - That is, because the accursed day and night did not do it. Aben Ezra supposes that God is meant here, and that the complaint of Job is that he did not close his mother's womb.

Throughout the description the day and the night are personified, and are spoken of as active in introducing him into the world. He here curses them because they did not wholly prevent his birth.<p>Nor hid sorrow from mine eyes - By preventing my being born.

Job wishes his birth-day may become dies ater, swallowed up by darkness as into nothing.

Day emerges from the darkness as Eloah from above (as <a href="//biblehub.com/job/31-2.htm">Job 31:2</a>, <a href="/job/31-28.htm">Job 31:28</a>), i.e., He who reigns over the changes here below, asks after it; interests Himself in His own (&#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;). Job wishes his birth-day may not rejoice in this. The relations of this his birth-day are darkness and the shadow of death. These are to redeem it, as, according to the right of kinsmen, family property is redeemed when it has got into a stranger's hands. This is the meaning of &#1490;&#1468;&#1488;&#1500; (lxx &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;), not  equals  &#1490;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;, inquinent (Targ.). &#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1492; is collective, as &#1504;&#1492;&#1512;&#1492;, mass of cloud. Instead of &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497; (the Caph of which seems pointed as praepos), we must read with Ewald (157, a), Olshausen, (187, b), and others, &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;, after the form &#1495;&#1499;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;, darkness, dark flashing (vid., on <a href="/psalms/10-8.htm">Psalm 10:8</a>), &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1512;&#1497;&#1512;, tapestry, unless we are willing to accept a form of noun without example elsewhere. The word signifies an obscuring, from &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1512;, to glow with heat, because the greater the glow the deeper the blackness it leaves behind. All that ever obscures a day is to overtake and render terrible that day.<p>(Note: We may compare here, and further, on, Constance's outburst of despair in King John (3:1 and 3:4). Shakespeare, like Goethe, enriches himself from the book of Job.) </body></html>
