No creature comes into the world so helpless as man. God's power and providence upheld our frail lives, and his pity and patience spared our forfeited lives. Natural affection is put into parents' hearts by God. To desire to die that we may be with Christ, that we may be free from sin, is the effect and evidence of grace; but to desire to die, only that we may be delivered from the troubles of this life, savours of corruption. It is our wisdom and duty to make the best of that which is, be it living or dying; and so to live to the Lord, and die to the Lord, as in both to be his, Ro 14:8. Observe how Job describes the repose of the grave; There the wicked cease from troubling. When persecutors die, they can no longer persecute. There the weary are at rest: in the grave they rest from all their labours. And a rest from sin, temptation, conflict, sorrows, and labours, remains in the presence and enjoyment of God. There believers rest in Jesus, nay, as far as we trust in the Lord Jesus and obey him, we here find rest to our souls, though in the world we have tribulation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For now should I have lain still - In this verse Job uses four expressions to describe the state in which be would have been if he had been so happy as to have died when an infant. It is evidently a very pleasant subject to him, and he puts it in a great variety of form. He uses thc words which express the most quiet repose, a state of perfect rest, a gentle slumber; and then in the next verses he says, that instead of being in the miserable condition in which he then was, he would have been in the same state with kings and the most illustrious men of the earth.<p>I should have lain still -  - &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1489;  sha&#770;kab. I should have been "lying down," as one does who is taking grateful repose. This is a word of less strength than any of those which follow.<p>And been quiet -  - &#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1496;  sha&#770;qat&#803;. A word of stronger signification than that before used. It means to rest, to lie down, to have quiet. It is used of one who is never troubled, harassed, or infested by others, <a href="/judges/3-11.htm">Judges 3:11</a>; <a href="/judges/5-31.htm">Judges 5:31</a>; <a href="/judges/8-25.htm">Judges 8:25</a>; and of one who has no fear or dread, <a href="/psalms/76-9.htm">Psalm 76:9</a>. The meaning is, that he would not only have lain down, but; would have been perfectly tranquil. Nothing would have harassed him, nothing would have given him any annoyance.<p>I should have slept -  - &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1503;  ya&#770;she&#770;n. This expression also is in advance of those before used. There would not only have been "quiet," but there would have been a calm and gentle slumber. Sleep is often representcd as "the kinsman of death." Thus, Virgil speaks of it:<p>"Tum consanguineus Leti sopor - "<p>Aeneid vi. 278.<p>So Homer:<p>Enth' hupno&#772; cumble&#772;to chasigne&#772;to thanatoio - <p>Iliad, 14:231.<p>This comparsion is an obvious one, and is frequently used in the Classical writers. It is employed to denote the calmness, stillness, and quiet of death. In the Scriptures it frequently occurs, and with a significancy far more beautiful. It is there employed not only to denote the tranquility of death, but also to denote the Christian hopes of a resurrection and the prospect of being awakened out of the long sleep. We lie down to rest at night with the hopes of awaking again. We sleep calmly, with the expectation that it will be only a temporary repose, and that we shall be aroused, invigorated for augmented toil, and refreshed for sweeter pleasure. So the Christian lies down in the grave. So the infant is committed to the calm slumber of the tomb. It may be a sleep stretching on through many nights and weeks and years and centuries, and even cycles of ages, but it is not eternal. The eyes will be opened again to behold the beauties of creation; the ear will be unstoppod to hear the sweet voice of fricndship and the harmony of music; and the frame will be raised up beautiful and immortal to engage in the service of the God that made us; compare <a href="/psalms/13-3.htm">Psalm 13:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/90-5.htm">Psalm 90:5</a>; <a href="/john/11-11.htm">John 11:11</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-51.htm">1 Corinthians 15:51</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-14.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:14</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-10.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:10</a>. Whether Job used the word in this sense and with this understanding, has been made a matter of question, and will be considered more fully in the examination of the passage in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/19-25.htm">Job 19:25-27</a>.<p>Then had I been at rest - Instead of the troubles and anxieties which I now experience.

I should not only have lain, but been quiet, and not only been quiet, but slept.

Signifying, that if the above had been his case, if he had died as soon as born, or quickly after, then he would have been laid in the grave, where he would have lain as still as on a bed; for such is the grave to dead bodies as a bed is to those that lie down and sleep upon it; a place of ease and quiet, where there is freedom from all care and thought, from all trouble, anxiety, and distress; nay, more so than on a bed, where there is often tossing to and fro, and great disquietude, but none to the body in the grave, that is still and silent, where there is no uneasiness nor disturbance, see <a href="//biblehub.com/job/17-13.htm">Job 17:13</a>, <p>I should have slept; soundly and quietly, which persons do not always upon their beds; sometimes they cannot sleep at all, and when they do, they are frequently distressed with uneasy thoughts, frightful dreams, and terrifying visions, <a href="/job/4-13.htm">Job 4:13</a>; but death is a sound sleep until the resurrection morn, which Job had knowledge of, and faith in, and so considered the state of the dead in this light; death is often in Scripture expressed by sleeping, <a href="/daniel/12-2.htm">Daniel 12:2</a>; which refers not to the soul, which in a separate state is active and vigorous, and always employed; but to the body, which, as in sleep, so in death, is deprived of the senses, and the exercise of them; on which account there is a great likeness between sleep and death, and out of which a man awakes brisk and cheerful, as the saints will at the time of their resurrection, which will be like an awaking out of sleep: <p>then had I been at rest; from all toil and labour, from all diseases and pains of body, from all troubles of whatsoever kind, and particularly from those he now laboured under; see Gill on <a href="/job/3-17.htm">Job 3:17</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For now should I have <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> lain still and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest,</span><p>(i) The vehemency of his afflictions made him utter these words as though death was the end of all miseries, and as if there were no life after this, which he speaks not as though it were so, but the infirmities of his flesh caused him to break out in this error of the wicked.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/job/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">13</span>.
