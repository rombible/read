He seeth every high thing, and is king over all the proud beasts. To Him then I say (<a href="/job/41-8.htm" title="Lay your hand on him, remember the battle, do no more.">Job 41:8</a>), Lay thine hand upon him; remember the battle, and do so no more. Lo! his hope is deceived. Is he indeed cast down at the very eight of him? He is not so cruel to himself that he should rouse him up. Who then can stand before me? Who hath first given to me, that I should have to repay him? That which is under the whole heavens is mine.” It cannot be denied that this makes very good sense, but it seems to be too great a liberty to take with the text as we find it to adopt this as the true order of the verses; for in that case, what is there that we might not deal with in a like manner? Those who advocate this transposition in the order of the verses would also place <a href="/context/job/40-1.htm" title="Moreover the LORD answered Job, and said,">Job 40:1-5</a> so as to follow <a href="/job/40-6.htm" title="Then answered the LORD to Job out of the whirlwind, and said,">Job 40:6</a>, in this manner: “Then Job answered the Lord and said, I know that thou canst do everything, and that no purpose can be withholden from thee, or that no purpose of thine can be restrained.” Then the next words come in as the implied answer of God: “Who is this that hideth my counsel for want of knowledge?” To which Job replies: “Therefore (I confess that) I have uttered without understanding things too wonderful for me, which I knew not.” Again God replies, as in <a href="/job/38-3.htm" title="Gird up now your loins like a man; for I will demand of you, and answer you me.">Job 38:3</a>; <a href="/job/40-7.htm" title="Gird up your loins now like a man: I will demand of you, and declare you to me.">Job 40:7</a> : “Hear, I beseech thee and I will speak, I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me; to which Job answers: “I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear, but now mine eye seeth thee. Wherefore I abhor what I have said, and repent it in dust and ashes.” Then the Lord answered Job and said, “Is he that contended with the Almighty reproved? Does he acknowledge his discomfiture? He that argueth with God, let him answer this question.” Then Job answered the Lord and said, “Behold I am vile. What shall I answer thee? I lay my hand before my mouth; once I have spoken, but I will not answer; yea twice, but I will not do so again.” There is a certain amount of sharpness and point obtained in thus making this confession the climax of the poem, and a kind of formal consistency is secured in regarding this resolution as Job’s last utterance instead of making him speak again, as he does, according to the present order, in <a href="/job/42-2.htm" title="I know that you can do every thing, and that no thought can be withheld from you.">Job 42:2</a>.

Whether this Leviathan be a whale or a crocodile, is disputed. The Lord, having showed Job how unable he was to deal with the Leviathan, sets forth his own power in that mighty creature. If such language describes the terrible force of Leviathan, what words can express the power of God's wrath? Under a humbling sense of our own vileness, let us revere the Divine Majesty; take and fill our allotted place, cease from our own wisdom, and give all glory to our gracious God and Saviour.

This can be true only of some such fierce creature as the crocodile.<p>Who is made without fear - Margin, "Or, behave themselves with fear."

As to form and figure; in most creatures there is some likeness between those in the sea and on the land, as sea horses, calves, &amp;c. but there is no likeness between a whale and any creature on earth; there is between the crocodile and the lizard; nor is any like the whale for the largeness of its bulk; the Targum is, <p>"his dominion is not on the earth,'' <p>but on the sea, as Aben Ezra notes; but rather the sense is, there is no power on earth that he obeys and submits to, as the Tigurine version; though the meaning seems to be, that there is none like him, for what follows: <p>who is made without fear; yet this agrees not neither with the crocodile, which Aelianus (w) says is fearful; nor with the whale, which will make off and depart at the shoutings of men, blowing of trumpets, and making use of any tinkling instruments, at which it is frightened, as Strabo (x), Philostratus (y), and Olaus Magnus (z), relate. It is observed (a); of their valour, that if they see a man or a long boat, they go under water and run away; and are never known to endeavour to hurt any man, but when in danger; though a voyager (b) of our own says, <p>"we saw whales in Whale-sound, and lying aloft on the water, not fearing our ships, or aught else.'' <p>The Targum is, <p>"he is made that he might not be broken;'' <p>or bruised, as Bochart; as reptiles usually may, among whom the crocodile may be reckoned, because of its short legs; and yet is made with such a hard scaly skin, that it cannot be crushed, bruised, and broken. Aben Ezra observes that some say, the word "hu", that is, "he", is wanting, and should be supplied, "he", that is, "God, made him without fear"; or that he might not be bruised; wherefore Cocceius interprets the following words entirely of God. <p>(w) De Animal. l. 10. c. 24.

The Targ. supports this latter signification here (funda quae projicit lapidem); but since &#1511;&#1500;&#1488;, the handling, is mentioned separately, the word appears to men missiles in general, or the catapult. In this combination of weapons of attack it is very questionable whether &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492; is a cognate form of &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503; (&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1503;), a coat of mail; probably it is equivalent to Arab. sirwe (surwe), an arrow with a long broad edge (comp. ser&#305;&#770;je, a short, round, as it seems, pear-shaped arrow-head), therefore either a harpoon or a peculiarly formed dart.<p>(Note: On the various kinds of Egyptian arrows, vid., Klemm. Culturgeschichte, v. 371f.)<p>"The son of the bow" (and of the &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1492;, pharetra) is the arrow.

Iron the crocodile esteems as &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1503;, tibn, chopped straw; sling stones are turned with him into &#1511;&#1513;&#1473;. Such is the name here at least, not for stumps of cut stubble that remain standing, but the straw itself, threshed and easily driven before the wind (<a href="/job/13-25.htm">Job 13:25</a>), which is cut up for provender (<a href="/exodus/5-12.htm">Exodus 5:12</a>), generally dried (and for that reason light) stalks (e.g., of grass), or even any remains of plants (e.g., splinters of wood).<p>(Note: The Egyptio-Arabic usage has here more faithfully preserved the ancient signification of the word (vid., Fleischer, Glossae, p. 37) than the Syro-Arabic; for in Syria cut but still unthreshed corn, whether lying in swaths out in the field and weighted with stones to protect it against the whirlwinds that are frequent about noon, or corn already brought to the threshing-floors but not yet threshed, is called qashsh. - Wetzst.)<p>The plur. &#1504;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/41-29.htm">Job 41:29</a>, does not seem to be occasioned by &#1514;&#1493;&#1514;&#1495; being conceived collectively, but by the fact that, instead of saying &#1514;&#1493;&#1514;&#1495; &#1493;&#1499;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1503;, the poet has formed &#1493;&#1499;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1503; into a separate clause.
