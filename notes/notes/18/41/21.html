Whether this Leviathan be a whale or a crocodile, is disputed. The Lord, having showed Job how unable he was to deal with the Leviathan, sets forth his own power in that mighty creature. If such language describes the terrible force of Leviathan, what words can express the power of God's wrath? Under a humbling sense of our own vileness, let us revere the Divine Majesty; take and fill our allotted place, cease from our own wisdom, and give all glory to our gracious God and Saviour. Remembering from whom every good gift cometh, and for what end it was given, let us walk humbly with the Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/41.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>His breath kindleth coals - It seems to be a flame, and to set on fire all around it.

All the representations of dragons breathing smoke and flames, found in the myths and sagas of so many countries, probably rest upon the observed fact of team or spray streaming forth from the mouth and widely opened nostrils of the crocodile. The steam has seemed to be smoke, and smoke has naturally suggested flame and fire. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/41.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>15  A pride are the furrows of the shields,<p>Shut by a rigid seal.<p>16  One joineth on to the other,<p>And no air entereth between them.<p>17  One upon another they are arranged,<p>They hold fast together, inseparably.<p>Since the writer uses &#1488;&#1508;&#1497;&#1511; both in the signif. robustus, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/12-12.htm">Job 12:12</a>, and canalis, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/40-18.htm">Job 40:18</a>, it is doubtful whether it must be explained robusta (robora) scutorum (as e.g., Ges.), or canales scutorum (Hirz., Schlottm., and others).
