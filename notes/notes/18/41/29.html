Whether this Leviathan be a whale or a crocodile, is disputed. The Lord, having showed Job how unable he was to deal with the Leviathan, sets forth his own power in that mighty creature. If such language describes the terrible force of Leviathan, what words can express the power of God's wrath? Under a humbling sense of our own vileness, let us revere the Divine Majesty; take and fill our allotted place, cease from our own wisdom, and give all glory to our gracious God and Saviour. Remembering from whom every good gift cometh, and for what end it was given, let us walk humbly with the Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/41.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Darts are counted as stubble - The word rendered "darts" (&#1514;&#1493;&#1514;&#1495;  to&#770;tha&#770;ch) occurs nowhere else in the Scriptures.

Darts being mentioned before, perhaps something else is meant here, and, according to Ben Gersom, the word signifies an engine out of which stones are cast to batter down walls; but these are of no avail against the leviathan; <p>he laugheth at the shaking of a spear; at him, knowing it cannot hurt him; the crocodile, as Thevenot says (g), is proof against the halberd. The Septuagint version is, "the shaking of the pyrophorus", or torch bearer; one that carried a torch before the army, who, when shook, it was a token to begin the battle; which the leviathan being fearless of laughs at it; See Gill on <a href="/obadiah/1-18.htm">Obadiah 1:18</a>. <p>(g) Travels, part 1. b. 2. c. 72. p. 245. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/41.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of a spear.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/job/41.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">29</span>. <span class="ital">darts are counted</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">clubs</span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/41.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Darts are counted as stubble</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the club is counted as stubble.</span> Maces, either of hard wood or of metal, were used by the Assyrians ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. p. 64).

The verb a&#770;la, ja'u&#770;lu, unites in itself the significations to go backward, to be forward, and to rule; the last two: anteriorem and superiorem esse, probably belong together, and &#1488;&#1500; signifies, therefore, a possessor of power, who is before and over others. &#1492;&#1514;&#1495;&#1496;&#1468;&#1488;, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/41-25.htm">Job 41:25</a>, has the signif., which does not otherwise occur, to miss the mark (from &#1495;&#1496;&#1488;, Arab. chat&#803;iya, to miss, opp. Arab. s&#803;a&#770;b, to hit the mark), viz., (which is most natural where &#1488;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; is the subject spoken of) since they had designed the slaughter and capture of the monster. &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; is intended subjectively, as &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1512;&#1488;  equals  &#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1491; <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/15-16.htm">Exodus 15:16</a>, Targ.
