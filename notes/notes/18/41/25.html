Whether this Leviathan be a whale or a crocodile, is disputed. The Lord, having showed Job how unable he was to deal with the Leviathan, sets forth his own power in that mighty creature. If such language describes the terrible force of Leviathan, what words can express the power of God's wrath? Under a humbling sense of our own vileness, let us revere the Divine Majesty; take and fill our allotted place, cease from our own wisdom, and give all glory to our gracious God and Saviour. Remembering from whom every good gift cometh, and for what end it was given, let us walk humbly with the Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/41.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>When he raiseth up himself - When he rouses himself for an attack or in self-defense.<p>The mighty are afraid - The Vulgate renders this "anqels." The meaning is, that he produces alarm on those who are unaccustomed to fear.<p>By reason of breakings they purify themselves - This, though a literal translation, conveys no very clear idea, and this rendering is not necessary. The word rendered "breakings" (&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1512;  sheber) means properly "a breaking, breach, puncture"; "a breaking down, destruction"; and then it may mean "a breaking down of the mind, that is, terror." This is evidently the meaning here. "By reason of the prostration of their courage, or the crushing of the mind by alarm." The word rendered "purify themselves" (&#1495;&#1496;&#1488;  cha&#770;t&#803;a&#770;') means in the Qal, "to miss," as a mark; "to sin; to err." In the form of Hithpael, which occurs here, it means to miss one's way; "to lose oneself;" and it may refer to the astonishment and terror by which one is led to miss his way in precipitate flight. "Gesenius." The meaning then is, "They lose themselves from terror."

Egyptian historians said that one of their early kings had been slain by a crocodile (Manetho ap. Euseb., 'Chronicles Can.,' pars 1:20, p. 98). The worship paid to crocodiles in some parts of Egypt, and the hatred felt towards them in others, were probably alike inspired by fear. AElian says that, in the districts where crocodiles were worshipped, it was not safe for any one to wash his feet or to draw water at the river, and that in the vicinity of some towns people did not dare to walk along the bank of the stream ('Nat. An.,' 10:24). In modern times they have been known to precipitate men from the bank into the water by a sweep of their tail, and then to devour them at their leisure. <span class="cmt_word">By reason of breakings they purify themselves</span>; rather, <span class="accented">they are confounded.</span> The "breakings" may by either the breakings forth of the animal from his lair among the Nile rushes, or his "breaking" of the weapons of his assailants. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/41.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>18  His sneezing sendeth forth light,<p>And his eyes are like the eyelids of the dawn;<p>19  Out of his mouth proceed flames,<p>Sparks of fire escape from him;<p>20  Out of his nostrils goeth forth smoke<p>Like a seething pot and caldron;<p>21  His breath kindleth coals,<p>And flames go forth out of his mouth.<p>That the crocodile delights to sun itself on the land, and then turns its open jaws to the sunny side, most Nile travellers since Herodotus have had an opportunity of observing; <p>(Note: Dieterici, Reisebilder, i.:194: "We very often saw the animal lying in the sand, its jaws wide open and turned towards the warm sunbeams, while little birds, like the slender white water-wagtail, march quietly about in the deadly abyss, and pick out worms from the watery jaws." Herodotus, ii. 68, tells exactly the same story; as the special friend of the crocodile among little birds, he mentions &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; (the sand-piper, Pluvianus Aegyptius).)<p>and in connection therewith the reflex action of sneezing may occur, since the light of the sun produces an irritation on the retina, and thence on the vagus; and since the sun shines upon the fine particles of watery slime cast forth in the act of sneezing, a meteoric appearance may be produced. This delicate observation of nature is here compressed into three words; in this concentration of whole, grand thoughts and pictures, we recognise the older poet. &#1506;&#1496;&#1513;&#1473; is the usual Semitic word for "sneezing" (Synon. &#1494;&#1512;&#1512;   <a href="/2_kings/4-35.htm">2 Kings 4:35</a>). &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1500; shortened from &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1500;, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/31-26.htm">Job 31:26</a>, Hiph. of &#1492;&#1500;&#1500;. The comparison of the crocodile's eyes with &#1506;&#1508;&#1506;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1512; (as <a href="//biblehub.com/job/3-9.htm">Job 3:9</a>, from &#1506;&#1508;&#1506;&#1507;, to move with quick vibrations, to wink, i.e., tremble), or the rendering of the same as &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#834;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; (lxx), is the more remarkable, as, according to Horus, i. 68, two crocodile's eyes are the hieroglyph<p>(Note: The eyes of the crocodile alone by themselves are no hieroglyph: how could they have been represented by themselves as crocodile's eyes? But in the Ramesseum and elsewhere the crocodile appears with a head pointing upwards in company with couching lions, and the eyes of the crocodile are rendered specially prominent. Near this group it appears again in a curved position, and quite small, but this time in company with a scorpion which bears a disc of the sun. The former (&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bf; &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;) seems to me to be a figure of the longest night, the latter (&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c2; in Horapollo) of the shortest, so that consequently &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769; and &#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; do not refer to the rising and setting of the sun, but to the night as prevailing against or succumbing to the day (communicated by Lauth from his researches on the astronomical monuments). But since the growth of the day begins with the longest night, and vice vers, the notions &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769; and &#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; can, as it seems to me, retain their most natural signification; and the crocodile's eyes are, notwithstanding, a figure of the light shining forth from the darkness, as the crocodile's tail signifies black darkness (and Egypt as the black land).)<p>for dawn, &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;: &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1; (probably to be read &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;) &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788; &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;. There it is the peculiar brilliancy of the eyes of certain animals that is intended, which is occasioned either by the iris being furnished with a so-called lustrous substance, or there being in the pupil of the eye (as e.g., in the ostrich) that spot which, shining like metal, is called tapetum lucidum. For &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; of the eyes &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;, is the lustre of the pupil in the depth of the eye. The eyes of the crocodile, which are near together, and slanting, glimmer through the water, when it is only a few feet under water, with a red glow.<p>Nevertheless the comparison in <a href="/job/41-18.htm">Job 41:18</a> might also be intended differently.
