Whether this Leviathan be a whale or a crocodile, is disputed. The Lord, having showed Job how unable he was to deal with the Leviathan, sets forth his own power in that mighty creature. If such language describes the terrible force of Leviathan, what words can express the power of God's wrath? Under a humbling sense of our own vileness, let us revere the Divine Majesty; take and fill our allotted place, cease from our own wisdom, and give all glory to our gracious God and Saviour. Remembering from whom every good gift cometh, and for what end it was given, let us walk humbly with the Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/41.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Lay thine hand upon him - Prof. Lee renders this, very improperly, as it seems to me, "Lay thine hand on thy mouth respecting him," supposing it means that he should be awed into silence by dread of the animal referred to. But the meaning of the passage evidently is, "Endeavor to seize him by laying the hand on him, and you will soon desist from the fearful conflict, and will not renew it."<p>Remember the battle - Remember what a fearful conflict will ensue. Perhaps there is an allusion to some fact fresh in the mind of Job, where such an attempt had been made to secure the leviathan, attended with fearful disaster to those who had made the attempt.<p>Do no more - Or, rather, "Thou wilt not do it again." That is, he would be deterred from ever renewing the attempt, or the conflict would be fatal to him. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/41.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8.

Elsewhere, however, the crocodile is thus named, and in fact as &#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503; also, another appellation of this natural wonder of Egypt, as an emblem of the mightiness of Pharaoh (vid., on <a href="/psalms/74-13.htm">Psalm 74:13</a>.), as once again the crocodile itself is called in Arab. el-fir&#8219;annu. The Old Testament language possesses no proper name for the crocodile; even the Talmudic makes use of &#1511;&#1512;&#1493;&#1511;&#1514;&#1488;  equals  &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; (Lewysohn, 271). &#1500;&#1493;&#1497;&#1514;&#1503; is the generic name of twisted, and &#1514;&#1504;&#1497;&#1503; long-extended monsters. Since the Egyptian name of the crocodile has not been Hebraized, the poet contents himself in &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498; with making a play upon its Egyptian, and in Arab. tmsa&#770;h&#803;, timsa&#770;h&#803;,<p>(Note: Herodotus was acquainted with this name (&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;  equals  &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;); thus is the crocodile called also in Palestine, where (as Tobler and Joh.
