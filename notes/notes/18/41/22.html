Whether this Leviathan be a whale or a crocodile, is disputed. The Lord, having showed Job how unable he was to deal with the Leviathan, sets forth his own power in that mighty creature. If such language describes the terrible force of Leviathan, what words can express the power of God's wrath? Under a humbling sense of our own vileness, let us revere the Divine Majesty; take and fill our allotted place, cease from our own wisdom, and give all glory to our gracious God and Saviour. Remembering from whom every good gift cometh, and for what end it was given, let us walk humbly with the Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/41.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In his neck remaineth strength - That is, strength is "permanently residing" there. It is not assumed for the moment, but his neck is so constructed as to be the abode of strength. The word here rendered "remaineth" (&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1503;  ya&#772;l&#305;&#770;yn), means properly to pass the night; then to abide or dwell; and there is a designed contrast here with what is said of "sorrow" in this verse. This description of strength residing in the neck, agrees well with the crocodile; see the figure of the animal on p. 255. It is not easy, however, to see how this is applicable to the whale, as Prof. Lee supposes. The whale is endowed, indeed, with great strength, as Prof. Lee has shown, but that strength is manifested mainly by the stroke of the tail.<p>And sorrow is turned into joy before him - Margin, "rejoiceth." The proper meaning of the word used here (&#1514;&#1491;&#1493;&#1509;  ta&#772;du&#770;ts) is "to dance, to leap, to skip;" and the sense is, that "terror dances before him." It does not refer to the motion of the animal, as if he were brisk and rapid. but it is a poetic expression, as if terror played or pranced along wherever he came. Strength "resided" in his neck, but his approach made terror and alarm play before him wherever he went; that is, produced terror and dread. In his neck is permanent, calm strength; before him, everything trembles and is agitated. The beauty of the passage lies in this contrast between the strength and firmness which repose calmly in the neck of the animal, and the consternation which he everywhere produces, causing all to tremble as he approaches. Bochart has well illustrated this from the Classical writers. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/41.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22. remaineth&#8212;abideth permanently.

This is meant either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

Or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. Of the crocodile, whom Aristotle, (who made it his business to search out the several natures and parts of all living creatures, and had all the helps and advantages which he desired to find them out,) and Scaliger, and others affirm to have a neck, though some deny it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Sorrow is turned into joy before him, </span> i.e. the approach of any enemy, which usually causeth fear and sorrow in others, fills him with joy, as being desirous of nothing more than fighting.

Sorrow is his companion or harbinger, which attends upon him wheresoever he goes. This may be a poetical expression, like that of the poets, when they bring in anger and fear going along with or before Mars into the battle. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/job/41.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>In his neck remaineth strength,.... This is thought to be an argument against the whale, which is said to have no neck: but whatever joins the head and body may be called the neck, though ever so small; and the shorter the neck is, the stronger it is. It is also said by some, that the crocodile has no neck also; but the philosopher (x) is express for it, that it has one and moves it: and Pliny (y) speaks of it as turning its head upwards, which it could not do without a neck; <p>and sorrow is turned into joy before him; or leaps and dances before him; it departs from him: he is not afraid of anything, though ever so threatening. Or sorrow and distress at the sight of him, in men and fishes, make them leap, and hasten to get out of the way of him and escape him. <p>(x) Aristot. Hist. Animal. l. 9. c. 6. &amp; Part.

It has been well remarked that the whale has no neck, or at any rate none {hat is visible, while the crocodile has one that is of great strength, and that naturally attracts observation. "Le cou assez marque," says the 'Dictionnaire des Sciences' (<span class="accented">l.s.c.</span>). It is nearly of the same diameter with the head at the point of junction, and where it adjoins the body is still larger. And sorrow is turned into joy before him; rather, and <span class="accented">terror rid'seth before him</span> (see the Revised Version). Whithersoever he proceeds, he causes terror; people tremble, take to flight, and disappear. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/41.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>15  A pride are the furrows of the shields,<p>Shut by a rigid seal.<p>16  One joineth on to the other,<p>And no air entereth between them.<p>17  One upon another they are arranged,<p>They hold fast together, inseparably.<p>Since the writer uses &#1488;&#1508;&#1497;&#1511; both in the signif. robustus, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/12-12.htm">Job 12:12</a>, and canalis, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/40-18.htm">Job 40:18</a>, it is doubtful whether it must be explained robusta (robora) scutorum (as e.g., Ges.), or canales scutorum (Hirz., Schlottm., and others).
