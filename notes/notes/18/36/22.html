He dilates on the power and majesty of God, and appears to be speaking in contemplation of some magnificent natural phenomenon—as the tempest, or hurricane, or whirlwind—out of which the Lord ultimately spake (<a href="/job/38-1.htm" title="Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,">Job 38:1</a>). It is probable that this storm was beginning to gather, and that it suggested the glorious imagery of Elihu’s speech. The points are that (1) God is the source of greatness; (2) that there is no teacher like Him (<a href="/job/36-22.htm" title="Behold, God exalts by his power: who teaches like him?">Job 36:22</a>); (3) that He is absolute as well as almighty (<a href="/job/36-23.htm" title="Who has enjoined him his way? or who can say, You have worked iniquity?">Job 36:23</a>); (4) that He is unsearchable and eternal (<a href="/job/36-26.htm" title="Behold, God is great, and we know him not, neither can the number of his years be searched out.">Job 36:26</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/job/36.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/job/36-22.htm" title="Behold, God exalts by his power: who teaches like him?...">Job 36:22-23</a></span>. <span class="ital">Behold, God exalteth by his power, </span>&c. — God is omnipotent; and therefore can either punish thee far worse, or deliver thee, if thou dost repent.

If he had a superior, who gave him laws for his actions, he might be accountable to him for what he did; but he is supreme and uncontrollable; who hath no law to regulate him but his own holy nature and blessed will, and therefore how rash and absurd a thing is it for any man to censure his proceedings! <span class="ital">Thou hast wrought iniquity </span>— Thou hast swerved from the law and rule given thee.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/job/36.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>36:15-23 Elihu shows that Job caused the continuance of his own trouble. He cautions him not to persist in frowardness. Even good men need to be kept to their duty by the fear of God's wrath; the wisest and best have enough in them to deserve his stroke. Let not Job continue his unjust quarrel with God and his providence. And let us never dare to think favourably of sin, never indulge it, nor allow ourselves in it. Elihu thinks Job needed this caution, he having chosen rather to gratify his pride and humour by contending with God, than to mortify them by submitting, and accepting the punishment. It is absurd for us to think to teach Him who is himself the Fountain of light, truth, knowledge, and instruction. He teaches by the Bible, and that is the best book; teaches by his Son, and he is the best Master. He is just in all proceedings.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/36.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Behold, God exalteth by his power - The object of Elihu is now to direct the attention of Job to God, and to show him that he has evinced such power and wisdom in his works, that we ought not to presume to arraign him, but should bow with submission to his will. He remarks, therefore, that God "exalts," or rather that God is "exalted," or "exalts himself" (&#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1490;&#1497;&#1489;  yas&#769;agiyb) by his power. In the exhibition of his power, he thus shows that he is great, and that people ought to be submissive to him. In support of this, he appeals, in the remainder of his discourse, to the "works" of God as furnishing extraordinary proofs of power, and full demonstration that God is exalted far above man.<p>Who teacheth like him? - The Septuagint renders this, &#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;  dunaste&#772;s - "Who is so powerful as he?" Rosenmuller and Umbreit render it Lord: "Who is Lord like him?" But the Hebrew word (&#1502;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492;  mo&#770;reh) properly means "one who instructs," and the idea is, that there is no one who is qualified to give so exalted conceptions of the government of God as he is himself. The object is to direct the mind to him as he is revealed in his works, in order to obtain elevated conceptions of his government. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/36.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22-25. God is not to be impiously arraigned, but to be praised for His might, shown in His works.<p>exalteth&#8212;rather, doeth lofty things, shows His exalted power [Umbreit] (Ps 21:13).<p>teacheth&#8212;(Ps 94:12, &c.). The connection is, returning to Job 36:5, God's "might" is shown in His "wisdom"; He alone can teach; yet, because He, as a sovereign, explains not all His dealings, forsooth Job must presume to teach Him (Isa 40:13, 14; Ro 11:34; 1Co 2:16). So the transition to Job 36:23 is natural. Umbreit with the Septuagint translates, "Who is Lord," wrongly, as this meaning belongs to later Hebrew.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/job/36.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">God exalteth; </span> or, <span class="ital">is high</span>, or exalted; the active verb being taken intransitively; which is not unusual in the Hebrew tongue. This is a proper argument to force the foregoing counsels. God is omnipotent; and therefore can with great facility either punish thee far worse, if thou be obstinate and refractory; or deliver thee, if thou dost repent and return to him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Who teacheth like him?</span> he is also infinitely wise as well as powerful; and as none can work like him, so none can teach like him. Therefore do not presume to teach him how to govern the world, or to order thy affairs; but know that whatsoever he doth with thee, or with any other men, is best to be done. And therefore be willing to learn from him. Learn obedience by the things which thou sufferest from him; and do not follow thy own fancies or affections, but use the methods which God hath taught thee to get out of thy troubles, by submission, and prayer, and repentance. The words may be rendered, <span class="ital">what lord is like him</span>? For the word <span class="ital">moreb</span> in the Chaldee dialect signifies a <span class="ital">lord</span>. This translation suits with the former clause of this verse; but ours agrees well enough with that, and is confirmed by the following verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/job/36.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Behold, God exalteth by his power,.... He exalts himself, or causes himself to be exalted, and even above all the blessing and praise of his creatures; by his power, in the works of creation and providence, he makes such a display of his glorious perfections, as to set him on high, and out of the reach of the highest praises of men. He exalts his Son as Mediator, and has made him higher than the kings of the earth, <a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>; he exalts him as a Prince and a Saviour, <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/5-31.htm">Acts 5:31</a>, to give repentance and remission of sins to his people, and to be the Judge of quick and dead, <a href="/acts/10-42.htm">Acts 10:42</a>. He has exalted the human nature of Christ to the grace of union to the Son of God: and exalted him in this nature at his right hand, far above all principality and power, <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/1-21.htm">Ephesians 1:21</a>, he exalts men in a civil sense, who are in a low estate, and raises them to a very high one; promotion is alone of him, he sets up and puts down at pleasure. In a spiritual sense, he exalts men when he brings them out of a state of nature into an open state of grace; brings them out of the horrible pit, and sets their feet upon the rock Christ Jesus; takes them as beggars from the dunghill, and places them among princes, even the princes of his people; admits them to communion with himself, puts and keeps them in his favour, as in a garrison; and at last causes them to inherit the throne of glory, <a href="/1_samuel/2-8.htm">1 Samuel 2:8</a>. He exalts men, when he sets the poor on high from affliction, and brings them out of adversity into prosperity; and which is what may be chiefly intended here; let a man he brought as low as may, God can by his power, if he will, raise him up again. And this may be said for the comfort and encouragement of Job, in his present circumstances: and so Aben Ezra interprets it, <p>"God will exalt thee;'' <p>as he afterwards did. The Targum is, <p>"behold, God alone is strong in his might;'' <p>see <a href="/psalms/21-13.htm">Psalm 21:13</a>; <p>who teacheth like him? He teaches by his providences, adverse as well as prosperous; he teaches by his word and ordinances; he teaches by his Spirit and grace, and none teaches like him. Ministers of the word teach men both doctrine and duty, but not like him; they have their gifts for teaching, their wisdom and knowledge, their doctrine, and all the use they are of, from him; none teach so pleasantly, so profitably, so powerfully and effectually, as he does: the Targum adds, <p>"right things?'' <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/36.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Behold, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him?</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/job/36.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">22</span>. <span class="ital">exalteth by his power</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">God doeth loftily in his power</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">who teacheth</span>] Or, <span class="bld">who is a teacher</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">22–25</span>.

Who teacheth like him? This has been called "the key-note of Elihu's whole discourse" (Cook). The entire providential government of the world by God he views as didactic, as a series of moral lessons addressed to men by their Maker (see <a href="/job/33-14.htm">Job 33:14, 16</a>; <a href="/job/35-11.htm">Job 35:11</a>; <a href="/job/36-9.htm">Job 36:9</a>, etc.).

Since it is usual to place &#1488;&#1507; (like &#1490;&#1468;&#1501; and &#1488;&#1498;) at the beginning of the sentence, although not belonging to the member of the sentence which immediately follows, &#1493;&#1488;&#1507; &#1492;&#1505;&#1497;&#1514;&#1498; for &#1493;&#1492;&#1505;&#1497;&#1514; &#1488;&#1507; &#1488;&#1514;&#1498; cannot be remarkable. The praet. &#1492;&#1505;&#1497;&#1514;&#1498; is not promissory, but Elihu says with what design God has decreed the present suffering for Job. &#1492;&#1505;&#1497;&#1514; &#1502;&#1503; is like <a href="/2_chronicles/18-31.htm">2 Chronicles 18:31</a> : out of distress (&#1510;&#1512; for &#1510;&#1512; by Rebia magnum), which has him in its jaws, and threatens to swallow him, God brings him away to great prosperity; a thought which Elihu expresses in the imagery of the Psalms of a broad place and a bountiful table (comp. e.g., <a href="/psalms/4-2.htm">Psalm 4:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/23-5.htm">Psalm 23:5</a>). &#1512;&#1495;&#1489; is locative, and &#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1510;&#1511; &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1492; is either a relative clause: whose beneath (ground) is not straitened, no-straitness (in which case &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1510;&#1511; would not be constr. from the n. hophal. &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1510;&#1511;, Isa.Isa 9:1, but absol. after the form &#1502;&#1495;&#1504;&#1511;, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/7-15.htm">Job 7:15</a>, Ew. 160, c, Anm. 4), Saad.

A special clause takes the place of the locative, <a href="/job/36-16.htm">Job 36:16</a> : and the settling or spreading, i.e., the provision (from &#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;, to come down gradually, to seat one's self) of thy table shall be full of fatness. &#1502;&#1500;&#1488; (whether it be adj. or verb) is treated by attraction, according to the gender of the governed noun; and it is unnecessary, with Rosenm. and others, to derive &#1504;&#1495;&#1514; from &#1504;&#1495;&#1514; (Aram. for &#1497;&#1512;&#1491;).<p>In <a href="//biblehub.com/job/36-17.htm">Job 36:17</a>, &#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503; is intended of Job's negative judgment concerning God and His dealings (comp. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/76-9.htm">Psalm 76:9</a>, where it signifies a judicial decision, and <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/22-10.htm">Proverbs 22:10</a>, where it signifies a wrangling refusal of a fair decision). <a href="/job/36-17.htm">Job 36:17</a> is not a conditional clause (Hahn), in which case the praet. hypothet. would have a prominent position, but an adversative predicative clause: but (nevertheless) thou art full of the judging of the evil-doer (evil judging); after which, just as &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2; as <a href="//biblehub.com/job/36-14.htm">Job 36:14</a>, the sad issue in which this judging after the manner of evil-doers results is expressed: such judging and judgment border closely upon one another. Rd., Dietr., and Schlottm. have wrongly reproduced this idea, discerned by Ges., when they translate: judgment and sentence (guilt and punishment) shall seize thee. &#1497;&#1514;&#1502;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;, prehendunt scil. se (Ebr.: put forth the hand), is used like the Aram. &#1505;&#1502;&#1498;, to draw nearer, fasten together (Rabb. &#1505;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498;, near at hand), Arab. tama&#770;saka (from Arab. msk  equals  &#1505;&#1502;&#1498;, as e.g., hanash  equals  &#1504;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;). In <a href="/job/36-18.htm">Job 36:18</a> we leave the signification thick milk or cream (&#1495;&#1502;&#1492;  equals  &#1495;&#1502;&#1488;&#1492;, as <a href="/job/29-6.htm">Job 29:6</a>) to those who persuade themselves that cream can be metaphorically equivalent to superfluity (Ew., Hirz., Vaih., Hlgst.). Renan's translation: N'espre pas dtourner la colre de Dieu par une amende, we also leave as a simple puzzle to its discoverer, who, with this one exception, is destitute of thoughts proper to the book of Job. In general, the thought, "do not imagine by riches, by a great ransom, to be able to satisfy the claims of God," is altogether out of place here. Moreover, &#1495;&#1502;&#1492;, which, as e.g., &#1491;&#1468;&#1488;&#1490;&#1492;, <a href="/proverbs/12-25.htm">Proverbs 12:25</a> (Ew. 174, g), is construed as masc., cannot be understood of God's wrath, since the poet by &#1492;&#1505;&#1497;&#1514; will not at one time have ascribed to God a well-meant incitation, at another an enticement in malam partem. That which allures is Job's own &#1495;&#1502;&#1492;, and that not the excitement of his affliction (Hahn), but of his passion; comp. &#1488;&#1507;, <a href="/job/36-13.htm">Job 36:13</a>. &#1513;&#1474;&#1508;&#1511; is, however, to be explained according to <a href="//biblehub.com/job/34-37.htm">Job 34:37</a>, comp. <a href="/job/27-23.htm">Job 27:23</a> (clapping of hands  equals  derision); and &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1512; signifies reconciliation or expiation, as <a href="/job/33-24.htm">Job 33:24</a>. Elihu admonishes Job not to allow himself to be drawn by the heat of passion into derision, or to deride; nor to be allured from the right way by the ransom which is required of him as the price of restoration to happiness, viz., humble submission to the divine chastisement, as though this ransom were exceeding great. The connection is clear: an adverse verdict (&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503;) and condemnation (&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;) are closely connected; for (&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;) hastiness of temper, let it not (&#1508;&#1468;&#1503;( ton ti ) lead thee astray ... thou wouldst not escape the judgment of God! </body></html>
