Elihu may be speaking, not of what God would have done, but of what He has actually done: “Yea, also He hath removed thee from the mouth of an adversary, even case and abundance in the place of which there was no straitness, and that which came down upon thy table full of fatness; but thou art full of the judgment of the wicked, therefore justice and judgment take hold on thee.” “God, in His mercy, saw that thou wast in danger, and He removed the cause of temptation, and thy chastisement would have been of short duration hadst thou been submissive and resigned; but thou hast been bold and daring, like the wicked, and hast reaped the judgment of the wicked.”<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/job/36.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>36:15-23 Elihu shows that Job caused the continuance of his own trouble. He cautions him not to persist in frowardness. Even good men need to be kept to their duty by the fear of God's wrath; the wisest and best have enough in them to deserve his stroke. Let not Job continue his unjust quarrel with God and his providence. And let us never dare to think favourably of sin, never indulge it, nor allow ourselves in it. Elihu thinks Job needed this caution, he having chosen rather to gratify his pride and humour by contending with God, than to mortify them by submitting, and accepting the punishment. It is absurd for us to think to teach Him who is himself the Fountain of light, truth, knowledge, and instruction. He teaches by the Bible, and that is the best book; teaches by his Son, and he is the best Master. He is just in all proceedings.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/36.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Even so would he have removed thee - That is, if you had been patient and resigned, and if you had gone to him with a broken heart. Having stated the "principles" in regard to affliction which he held to be indisputable, and having affirmed that God was ever ready to relieve the sufferer if he would apply to him with a proper spirit, it was natural to infer from this that the reason why Job "continued" to suffer was, that he did not manifest a proper spirit in his trials. Had he done this, Elihu says, the hand of God would have been long since withdrawn, and his afflictions would have been removed.<p>Out of the strait into a broad place - From the narrow, pent up way, where it is impossible to move, into a wide and open path. Afflictions are compared with a narrow path, in which it is impossible to get. along; prosperity with a broad and open road in which there are no obstructions; compare <a href="/psalms/18-19.htm">Psalm 18:19</a>; <a href="/psalms/31-8.htm">Psalm 31:8</a>. "And that which should be set on thy table." Margin, "the rest of thy table." The Hebrew word (&#1504;&#1495;&#1514;  nachath - from &#1504;&#1493;&#1495;  nu&#770;ach, "to rest," and in the Hiphil to set down, to cause to rest) means properly a "letting," or "settling down;" and then that which is set down - as e. g. food on a table. This is the idea here. that the food which would be set on his table would be rich and abundant; that is, he would be restored to prosperity, if he envinced a penitent spirit in his trials, and confessed his sins to God. The same image of piety occurs in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/23-5.htm">Psalm 23:5</a>, "Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/36.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16.

Or, <span class="ital">allured</span>, or <span class="ital">enticed</span>, or <span class="ital">persuaded thee</span>, as the word properly signifies; which possibly may here be emphatical, and may imply, as that Job had by his sins brought himself into these straits, so that God would have brought him out of them by the usual and regular way, to wit, by persuading him to turn from his sins, and humbly and earnestly to cry to God for mercy, which if he had complied with, God would have delivered him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Out of the strait, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">out of the mouth or jaws of tribulation</span>; which like a wild beast was read to swallow him up. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Into a broad place, </span> i.e. into a state of ease and freedom. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Thy table; </span> thy dishes, or the food in them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/job/36.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Even so,.... Here Elihu accommodates what he had said to the case of Job; that had he hearkened and been obedient to the voice of God in his rod, and had submitted to his chastening hand, and patiently bore his afflictions; <p>he, God, <p>would have removed thee out of the strait into a broad place, where there is no straitness: that is, out of the strait circumstances in which he was, into liberty; would have brought him into a large place, where he might walk at liberty, as David experienced, <a href="/psalms/4-1.htm">Psalm 4:1</a>; and may be understood both in a temporal and spiritual sense. In a temporal sense; he was now in great straits, in poverty and affliction; these pressed him hard on every side, so that his way, as he says, was "fenced up, that he could not pass", <a href="/job/19-8.htm">Job 19:8</a>. Now had he been rightly humbled under his affliction, God would have taken him out of the straits of adversity, and set his feet in a large room of prosperity; see <a href="/psalms/31-7.htm">Psalm 31:7</a>. In a spiritual sense; persons are as in a strait place and pent up, when they cannot come forth in the free exercise of grace and duty; their souls are as it were in prison, they are shut up, and have not freedom with God nor man; their faith is ready to fail, their hope is sunk very low, they are straitened in their own bowels or affections, in their love to God and his people: and then they are removed into a large place, when it is the reverse with them; when they are favoured with the free spirit of the Lord, for where he is there is liberty; and when their hearts are enlarged with the love of God, and in the exercise of grace; and then they can run cheerfully the ways of his commandments; <p>and that which should be set on thy table should be full of fatness; which in a temporal sense denotes, that he should have had a plentiful table, spread with the best of provisions, the richest dainties, the finest of the wheat, and the fattest of the creatures; and these should rest and remain upon his table, or be constantly renewed there: and in a spiritual sense, that his soul should have been satisfied with the love of God, shed abroad in his heart; with the blessings of the everlasting covenant of grace applied unto him; and with the goodness of the house of God, his word and ordinances, as with marrow and fatness; see <a href="/psalms/63-5.htm">Psalm 63:5</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/36.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait <i>into</i> a broad place, where <i>there is</i> no straitness; and <span class="cverse3">{l}</span> that which should be set on thy table <i>should be</i> full of fatness.</span><p>(l) If you had been obedient to God, he would have brought you to freedom and wealth.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/job/36.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">16</span>. The words <span class="ital">even so</span> connect Job’s case with the general principles in regard to suffering just inculcated by Elihu. The figures of “straitness” and “broad place” are usual for affliction and prosperity, cf. ch. <a href="/job/18-7.htm" title="The steps of his strength shall be straitened, and his own counsel shall cast him down.">Job 18:7</a>. The figure of a plenteous table is also common, <a href="/psalms/23-5.htm" title="You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies: you anoint my head with oil; my cup runs over.">Psalm 23:5</a>. The speaker does not say by what means God is alluring the sufferer out of the mouth or jaws of distress into a broad place. He means probably the disciplining effects of the distress itself, unless the “distress” here refer to a future, greater evil, from which Job’s present affliction is designed to save him. Comp., however, ch. <a href="/context/job/33-14.htm" title="For God speaks once, yes twice, yet man perceives it not....">Job 33:14-28</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">16–25</span>.

Another quite different interpretation has been proposed by Ewald, and adopted by Dillmann and Canon Cook, who suppose Elihu to speak, not of what would have happened to Job under certain circumstances, but of what had actually happened to him, and render, "Thee moreover hath thy unbounded prosperity seduced from listening to the voice of affliction, and the case of thy table which was full of fatness." But the rendering of the Authorized Version, which is substantially that of Schultens and Rosenmuller, is still upheld by many scholars, and has been retained by our Revisers. If we adopt it, we must understand Elihu as assuring Job that he too would have been delivered and restored to his prosperity, if he had accepted his afflictions in a proper <span class="accented">spirits</span> and learnt the lesson they were intended to teach him (see vers. 9, 10). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/36.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>  8  And if they are bound with chains,<p>Holden in cords of affliction:<p>  9  Then He declareth to them their doing<p>And their transgressions, that they have been vainglorious;<p>10  Then He openeth their ear to warning,<p>And commandeth them to turn from iniquity.<p>The subj. is in no case the &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; (Hahn), but the &#1510;&#1491;&#1497;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501;, or those who are as susceptible to discipline as it is needful to them, just as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/107.htm">Psalm 107</a>, which in general presents many instances for an extensive comparison with the speeches of Elihu. The chains, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/36-8.htm">Job 36:8</a>, are meant literally, and the bands, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/36-8.htm">Job 36:8</a>, figuratively; the Psalmist couples both in &#1488;&#1505;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497; &#1506;&#1504;&#1497; &#1493;&#1489;&#1512;&#1494;&#1500;, <a href="/psalms/107-10.htm">Psalm 107:10</a>. The conclusion begins with <a href="//biblehub.com/job/36-9.htm">Job 36:9</a>, and is repeated in another application, <a href="/job/36-10.htm">Job 36:10</a>. &#1508;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500; in the sense of maleficium, as Arab. fa&#8219;alat, recalls &#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;, facinus, <a href="/job/33-17.htm">Job 33:17</a>. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/36-9.htm">Job 36:9</a>, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/36-10.htm">Job 36:10</a>, an objective quod. It is not translated, however, quod invaluerint (Rosenm.), which is opposed to the most natural sense of the Hithpa., but according to <a href="/job/15-25.htm">Job 15:25</a> : quod sese extulerint. &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1512;, &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;, disciplina, interchanges here with the more rare &#1502;&#1505;&#1512; used in <a href="/job/33-16.htm">Job 33:16</a>; there we have already also met with the phrase &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492; &#1488;&#1494;&#1503;, to uncover the ear, i.e., to open. &#1488;&#1502;&#1512; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; corresponds to the Arab. amara an (bi-an), to command that. The fundamental thought of Elihu here once again comes unmistakeably to view: the sufferings of the righteous are well-meant chastisements, which are to wean them from the sins into which through carnal security they have fallen - a warning from God to penitence, designed to work their good. </body></html>
