Hence Elihu proceeds to give some instances, in the works of nature and common providence. His general aim is to show, 1st, That God is the first cause and supreme director of all the creatures; whom therefore we ought with all humility and reverence to adore: 2d, That it is presumption in us to prescribe to him in his special providence toward men, when the operations even of common providence about the meteors are so mysterious and unaccountable.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/job/36.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>36:24-33 Elihu endeavours to fill Job with high thought of God, and so to persuade him into cheerful submission to his providence. Man may see God's works, and is capable of discerning his hand in them, which the beasts are not, therefore they ought to give him the glory. But while the worker of iniquity ought to tremble, the true believer should rejoice. Children should hear with pleasure their Father's voice, even when he speaks in terror to his enemies. There is no light but there may be a cloud to intercept it. The light of the favour of God, the light of his countenance, the most blessed light of all, even that light has many a cloud. The clouds of our sins cause the Lord to his face, and hinder the light of his loving-kindness from shining on our souls.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/36.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Remember that thou magnify his work - Make this a great and settled principle, to remember that God is "great" in all that he does. He is exalted far above us, and all his works are on a scale of vastness corresponding to his nature, and in all our attempts to judge of him and his doings, we should bear this in remembrance. He is not to be judged by the narrow views which we apply to the actions of people, but by the views which ought to be taken when we remember that he presides over the vast universe, and that as the universal Parent, he will consult the welfare of the whole. In judging of his doings, therefore, we are not to place ourselves in the center, or to regard ourselves as the "whole" or the creation, but we are to remember that there are other great interests to be regarded, and that his plans will be in accordance with the welfare of the whole. One of the best rules for taking a proper estimate of God is that proposed here by Elihu - to remember that he is great.<p>Which men behold - The Vulgate renders this, "de quo cecinerunt viri" - "concerning which men sing." The Septuagint, &#x3c9;&#788;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b7;&#787;&#834;&#x3c1;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;  ho&#772;n e&#772;rxan andres - "over which men rule." Schultens accords with the Vulgate. So Coverdale renders it, "Whom all men love and praise." So Herder and Noyes understand it, "Which men celebrate with songs." This difference of interpretation arises from the ambiguity of the Hebrew word (&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;  shoreru&#770;) some deriving it from &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1512;  shu&#770;r, "to go round about, and then to survey, look upon, examine"; and some from &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1512;  sh&#305;&#770;yr, "to sing, to celebrate." The word will admit of either interpretation, and either will suit the connection. The sense of "seeing" those works, however, better agrees with what is said in the following verse, and perhaps better suits the connection. The object of Elihu is not to fix the attention on the fact that people "celebrate" the works of God, but to turn "the eyes to the visible creation," as a proof of the greatness of the Almighty. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/36.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24.

Instead of murmuring, Job should "magnify God's work." He should recognize the mercy of God, even in his own afflictions, and praise him for it. Which men behold. Men are looking on, anxiously considering Job's sufferings; he is a spectacle to them, as the apostles were to men and angels (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-9.htm">1 Corinthians 4:9</a>), and the more reason therefore that he should, by patient endurance, by submission and confession, cause his sufferings to redound to the glory and honour of God. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/36.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>16  And He even bringeth thee out of the jaws of distress<p>To a broad place, whose ground hath no straitness,<p>And the adorning of thy table shall be full of fatness.<p>17  Yet thou art become full of the judging of the evil-doer:<p>Judging and judgment lay hold on one another!<p>18  For let not anger indeed entice thee to scorning,<p>And let not the greatness of the ransom mislead thee.<p>With <a href="/job/36-16.htm">Job 36:16</a> Elihu passes over to the application to Job of what he said in the preceding strophe. Since it is usual to place &#1488;&#1507; (like &#1490;&#1468;&#1501; and &#1488;&#1498;) at the beginning of the sentence, although not belonging to the member of the sentence which immediately follows, &#1493;&#1488;&#1507; &#1492;&#1505;&#1497;&#1514;&#1498; for &#1493;&#1492;&#1505;&#1497;&#1514; &#1488;&#1507; &#1488;&#1514;&#1498; cannot be remarkable. The praet. &#1492;&#1505;&#1497;&#1514;&#1498; is not promissory, but Elihu says with what design God has decreed the present suffering for Job. &#1492;&#1505;&#1497;&#1514; &#1502;&#1503; is like <a href="/2_chronicles/18-31.htm">2 Chronicles 18:31</a> : out of distress (&#1510;&#1512; for &#1510;&#1512; by Rebia magnum), which has him in its jaws, and threatens to swallow him, God brings him away to great prosperity; a thought which Elihu expresses in the imagery of the Psalms of a broad place and a bountiful table (comp. e.g., <a href="/psalms/4-2.htm">Psalm 4:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/23-5.htm">Psalm 23:5</a>). &#1512;&#1495;&#1489; is locative, and &#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1510;&#1511; &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1492; is either a relative clause: whose beneath (ground) is not straitened, no-straitness (in which case &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1510;&#1511; would not be constr. from the n. hophal. &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1510;&#1511;, Isa.Isa 9:1, but absol. after the form &#1502;&#1495;&#1504;&#1511;, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/7-15.htm">Job 7:15</a>, Ew. 160, c, Anm. 4), Saad. Arab. la&#770; d&#803;&#305;&#770;q f&#305;&#770; mu&#770;d&#803;&#8219;ha&#770; (cujus in loco non angustiae); or it is virtually an adj.: without (&#1500;&#1488;  equals  &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;, as <a href="/job/34-24.htm">Job 34:24</a>), comp. on <a href="/job/12-24.htm">Job 12:24</a>) straitness of what is beneath them, eorum quae sub se habet (comp. on <a href="/job/28-5.htm">Job 28:5</a>). &#1512;&#1495;&#1489; is fem., like &#1512;&#1495;&#1493;&#1489;, <a href="/daniel/9-25.htm">Daniel 9:25</a>. A special clause takes the place of the locative, <a href="/job/36-16.htm">Job 36:16</a> : and the settling or spreading, i.e., the provision (from &#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;, to come down gradually, to seat one's self) of thy table shall be full of fatness. &#1502;&#1500;&#1488; (whether it be adj. or verb) is treated by attraction, according to the gender of the governed noun; and it is unnecessary, with Rosenm. and others, to derive &#1504;&#1495;&#1514; from &#1504;&#1495;&#1514; (Aram. for &#1497;&#1512;&#1491;).<p>In <a href="//biblehub.com/job/36-17.htm">Job 36:17</a>, &#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503; is intended of Job's negative judgment concerning God and His dealings (comp. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/76-9.htm">Psalm 76:9</a>, where it signifies a judicial decision, and <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/22-10.htm">Proverbs 22:10</a>, where it signifies a wrangling refusal of a fair decision). <a href="/job/36-17.htm">Job 36:17</a> is not a conditional clause (Hahn), in which case the praet. hypothet. would have a prominent position, but an adversative predicative clause: but (nevertheless) thou art full of the judging of the evil-doer (evil judging); after which, just as &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2; as <a href="//biblehub.com/job/36-14.htm">Job 36:14</a>, the sad issue in which this judging after the manner of evil-doers results is expressed: such judging and judgment border closely upon one another. Rd., Dietr., and Schlottm. have wrongly reproduced this idea, discerned by Ges., when they translate: judgment and sentence (guilt and punishment) shall seize thee. &#1497;&#1514;&#1502;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;, prehendunt scil. se (Ebr.: put forth the hand), is used like the Aram. &#1505;&#1502;&#1498;, to draw nearer, fasten together (Rabb. &#1505;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498;, near at hand), Arab. tama&#770;saka (from Arab. msk  equals  &#1505;&#1502;&#1498;, as e.g., hanash  equals  &#1504;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;). In <a href="/job/36-18.htm">Job 36:18</a> we leave the signification thick milk or cream (&#1495;&#1502;&#1492;  equals  &#1495;&#1502;&#1488;&#1492;, as <a href="/job/29-6.htm">Job 29:6</a>) to those who persuade themselves that cream can be metaphorically equivalent to superfluity (Ew., Hirz., Vaih., Hlgst.). Renan's translation: N'espre pas dtourner la colre de Dieu par une amende, we also leave as a simple puzzle to its discoverer, who, with this one exception, is destitute of thoughts proper to the book of Job. In general, the thought, "do not imagine by riches, by a great ransom, to be able to satisfy the claims of God," is altogether out of place here. Moreover, &#1495;&#1502;&#1492;, which, as e.g., &#1491;&#1468;&#1488;&#1490;&#1492;, <a href="/proverbs/12-25.htm">Proverbs 12:25</a> (Ew. 174, g), is construed as masc., cannot be understood of God's wrath, since the poet by &#1492;&#1505;&#1497;&#1514; will not at one time have ascribed to God a well-meant incitation, at another an enticement in malam partem. That which allures is Job's own &#1495;&#1502;&#1492;, and that not the excitement of his affliction (Hahn), but of his passion; comp. &#1488;&#1507;, <a href="/job/36-13.htm">Job 36:13</a>. &#1513;&#1474;&#1508;&#1511; is, however, to be explained according to <a href="//biblehub.com/job/34-37.htm">Job 34:37</a>, comp. <a href="/job/27-23.htm">Job 27:23</a> (clapping of hands  equals  derision); and &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1512; signifies reconciliation or expiation, as <a href="/job/33-24.htm">Job 33:24</a>. Elihu admonishes Job not to allow himself to be drawn by the heat of passion into derision, or to deride; nor to be allured from the right way by the ransom which is required of him as the price of restoration to happiness, viz., humble submission to the divine chastisement, as though this ransom were exceeding great. The connection is clear: an adverse verdict (&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503;) and condemnation (&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;) are closely connected; for (&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;) hastiness of temper, let it not (&#1508;&#1468;&#1503;( ton ti ) lead thee astray ... thou wouldst not escape the judgment of God! </body></html>
