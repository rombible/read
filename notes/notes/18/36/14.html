He is always ready to defend those that are injured. If our eye is ever toward God in duty, his eye will be ever upon us in mercy, and, when we are at the lowest, will not overlook us. God intends, when he afflicts us, to discover past sins to us, and to bring them to our remembrance. Also, to dispose our hearts to be taught: affliction makes people willing to learn, through the grace of God working with and by it. And further, to deter us from sinning for the future. It is a command, to have no more to do with sin. If we faithfully serve God, we have the promise of the life that now is, and the comforts of it, as far as is for God's glory and our good: and who would desire them any further? We have the possession of inward pleasures, the great peace which those have that love God's law. If the affliction fail in its work, let men expect the furnace to be heated till they are consumed. Those that die without knowledge, die without grace, and are undone for ever. See the nature of hypocrisy; it lies in the heart: that is for the world and the flesh, while perhaps the outside seems to be for God and religion. Whether sinners die in youth, or live long to heap up wrath, their case is dreadful. The souls of the wicked live after death, but it is in everlasting misery.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/36.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They die in youth - Margin, "Their soul dieth." The word "soul" or "life" in the Hebrew is used to denote oneself. The meaning is, that they would soon be cut down, and share the lot of the openly wicked. If they amended their lives they might be spared, and continue to live in prosperity and honor; if they did not, whether openly wicked or hypocrites. they would be early cut off.<p>And their life is amnong the unclean - Margin, "Sodomites." The idea is, that they would be treated in the same way as the most abandoned and vile of the race. No special favor would be shown to them because they were "professors" of religion, nor would this fact be a shield against the treatment which they deserved. They could not be classed with the righteous, and must, therefore, share the fate of the most worth mss and wicked of the race. The word rendered "unclean" (&#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;  qa&#770;de&#770;sh) is from &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;  qa&#770;dash, "to be pure or holy"; and in the Hiphil to regard as holy, to consecrate, or devote to the service of God, as e. g. a priest; <a href="/exodus/28-41.htm">Exodus 28:41</a>; <a href="/exodus/29-1.htm">Exodus 29:1</a>. Then it means to consecrate or devote to "any" service or purpose, as to an idol god. Hence, it means one consecrated or devoted to the service of Astarte, the goddess of the Sidonians or Venus, and as this worship was corrupt and licentious, the word means one who is licentious or corrupt compare <a href="/deuteronomy/23-18.htm">Deuteronomy 23:18</a>; <a href="/1_kings/14-24.htm">1 Kings 14:24</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/38-21.htm">Genesis 38:21-22</a>. Here it means the licentious, the corrupt, the abandoned; and the idea is, that if hypocrites did not repent under the inflictions of divine judgment, they would be dealt with in the same way as the most abandoned and vile. On the evidence that licentiousness constituted a part of the ancient worship of idols, see Spencer "de Legg. ritual Hebraedor." Lib. ii. cap. iii. pp. 613, 614, Ed. 1732. Jerome renders this, "intereffoeminatos." The Septuagint strangely enough has: "Let their life be wounded by angels." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/36.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. Rather (De 23:17), Their life is (ended) as that of (literally, "among") the unclean, prematurely and dishonorably. So the second clause answers to the first.

They, or "their soul" (u); which, though that dies not, being immaterial and immortal; yet being the principal part of man, is put for the whole person, and which being taken away, the body dies. All men must die, but all do not die at an age; there is a common term of human life, <a href="/psalms/90-10.htm">Psalm 90:10</a>; some few exceed it, multitudes arrive not to it; such who die before it may be said to die in youth; it seems to signify premature and untimely death: the word signifies an "excussion", or violent shaking out; and the Vulgate Latin version is, "in a tempest"; in a tempest of divine wrath, and in a storm in their consciences, <a href="/job/27-20.htm">Job 27:20</a>. Jarchi interprets it by suffocation or strangling; <p>and their life is among the unclean: all men are by nature unclean, and all that is in them; some are more notoriously and openly so than others, who give themselves over to lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness; such as whoremongers and fornicators, of whom Mr. Broughton understands those unclean persons; or Sodomites, of whom the word is sometimes used, <a href="/deuteronomy/23-17.htm">Deuteronomy 23:17</a>. And this may be understood either of the present life of hypocrites before they die; who are unclean persons themselves, whatever show of purity they make, and love to live and converse, at least privately, if not openly, with unclean persons, and die while they live with such and in their sins: or of their life after death; for wicked men live after death; their souls live in hell, and their bodies at the resurrection will be raised to life, and be reunited to their souls, and both together will live in endless punishment; and the life of hypocrites will be among such; as is a man in life, so he is at and after death; if filthy, filthy still; and such will have no admittance into the heavenly state, and with such impure ones, hypocrites will live for ever, <a href="/revelation/21-8.htm">Revelation 21:8</a>. <p>(u) "anima eorum", Pagninus, Montanus, Tigurine version, Vatablus, Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator, &amp;c. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/36.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">They die in <span class="cverse3">{k}</span> youth, and their life <i>is</i> among the unclean.</span><p>(k) They die of some vile death, and that before they come to age.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/job/36.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">14</span>. <span class="ital">They die</span>] lit. <span class="ital">their soul dieth.</span> They perish in the midst of their days.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">is among the unclean</span>] Or, <span class="bld">perisheth among the unclean,</span> i. e. <span class="ital">like</span> the unclean.

The chains, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/36-8.htm">Job 36:8</a>, are meant literally, and the bands, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/36-8.htm">Job 36:8</a>, figuratively; the Psalmist couples both in &#1488;&#1505;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497; &#1506;&#1504;&#1497; &#1493;&#1489;&#1512;&#1494;&#1500;, <a href="/psalms/107-10.htm">Psalm 107:10</a>.

It is not translated, however, quod invaluerint (Rosenm.), which is opposed to the most natural sense of the Hithpa., but according to <a href="/job/15-25.htm">Job 15:25</a> : quod sese extulerint. &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1512;, &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;, disciplina, interchanges here with the more rare &#1502;&#1505;&#1512; used in <a href="/job/33-16.htm">Job 33:16</a>; there we have already also met with the phrase &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492; &#1488;&#1494;&#1503;, to uncover the ear, i.e., to open. &#1488;&#1502;&#1512; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; corresponds to the Arab. amara an (bi-an), to command that. The fundamental thought of Elihu here once again comes unmistakeably to view: the sufferings of the righteous are well-meant chastisements, which are to wean them from the sins into which through carnal security they have fallen - a warning from God to penitence, designed to work their good. </body></html>
