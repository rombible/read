He cautions him not to persist in frowardness. Even good men need to be kept to their duty by the fear of God's wrath; the wisest and best have enough in them to deserve his stroke. Let not Job continue his unjust quarrel with God and his providence. And let us never dare to think favourably of sin, never indulge it, nor allow ourselves in it. Elihu thinks Job needed this caution, he having chosen rather to gratify his pride and humour by contending with God, than to mortify them by submitting, and accepting the punishment. It is absurd for us to think to teach Him who is himself the Fountain of light, truth, knowledge, and instruction. He teaches by the Bible, and that is the best book; teaches by his Son, and he is the best Master. He is just in all proceedings.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/36.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Who hath enjoined him his way? - Who hath prescribed to him what he ought to do? Who is superior to him, and has marked out for him the plan which he ought to pursue? The idea is, that God is supreme and independent; no one has advised him, and no one has a right to counsel him. Perhaps, also, Elihu designs this as a reproof to Job for having complained so much of the government of God, and for being disposed, as he thought, to "prescribe" to God what he should do.<p>Who can say, Thou hast wrought iniquity? - Thou hast done wrong. The object of Elihu is here to show that no one has a right to say this; no one could, in fact, say it. It was to be regarded as an indisputable point that God is always right, and that however dark his dealings with people may seem, the "reason" why they are mysterious "never is, that God is wrong." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/36.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>23.

While God is thus the universal and all-perfect Teacher, there are some who would fain instruct him, dictate the course which he ought to pursue, improve and amend his universe. Something of this spirit has appeared in Job's remonstrances, which seem to insinuate that the Divine government of the world might be carried on better than it is (see <a href="/job/9-22.htm">Job 9:22-24</a>; <a href="/job/10-3.htm">Job 10:3</a>; <a href="/job/13-20.htm">Job 13:20-26</a>; <a href="/job/16-11.htm">Job 16:11-17</a>, etc.). Elihu's intention is to reprove Job for his presumption. <span class="cmt_word">Or who can say, Thou hast wrought iniquity?</span> Job has not said this; but he has gone near to saying it (<a href="/job/9-24.htm">Job 9:24</a>; <a href="/job/10-3.htm">Job 10:3</a>; <a href="/job/21-7.htm">Job 21:7-26</a>; <a href="/job/24-2.htm">Job 24:2-12</a>, etc.); compare the comment on Job 34:5-12. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/36.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>16  And He even bringeth thee out of the jaws of distress<p>To a broad place, whose ground hath no straitness,<p>And the adorning of thy table shall be full of fatness.<p>17  Yet thou art become full of the judging of the evil-doer:<p>Judging and judgment lay hold on one another!<p>18  For let not anger indeed entice thee to scorning,<p>And let not the greatness of the ransom mislead thee.<p>With <a href="/job/36-16.htm">Job 36:16</a> Elihu passes over to the application to Job of what he said in the preceding strophe. Since it is usual to place &#1488;&#1507; (like &#1490;&#1468;&#1501; and &#1488;&#1498;) at the beginning of the sentence, although not belonging to the member of the sentence which immediately follows, &#1493;&#1488;&#1507; &#1492;&#1505;&#1497;&#1514;&#1498; for &#1493;&#1492;&#1505;&#1497;&#1514; &#1488;&#1507; &#1488;&#1514;&#1498; cannot be remarkable. The praet. &#1492;&#1505;&#1497;&#1514;&#1498; is not promissory, but Elihu says with what design God has decreed the present suffering for Job. &#1492;&#1505;&#1497;&#1514; &#1502;&#1503; is like <a href="/2_chronicles/18-31.htm">2 Chronicles 18:31</a> : out of distress (&#1510;&#1512; for &#1510;&#1512; by Rebia magnum), which has him in its jaws, and threatens to swallow him, God brings him away to great prosperity; a thought which Elihu expresses in the imagery of the Psalms of a broad place and a bountiful table (comp. e.g., <a href="/psalms/4-2.htm">Psalm 4:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/23-5.htm">Psalm 23:5</a>). &#1512;&#1495;&#1489; is locative, and &#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1510;&#1511; &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1492; is either a relative clause: whose beneath (ground) is not straitened, no-straitness (in which case &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1510;&#1511; would not be constr. from the n. hophal. &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1510;&#1511;, Isa.Isa 9:1, but absol. after the form &#1502;&#1495;&#1504;&#1511;, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/7-15.htm">Job 7:15</a>, Ew. 160, c, Anm. 4), Saad.

A special clause takes the place of the locative, <a href="/job/36-16.htm">Job 36:16</a> : and the settling or spreading, i.e., the provision (from &#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;, to come down gradually, to seat one's self) of thy table shall be full of fatness. &#1502;&#1500;&#1488; (whether it be adj. or verb) is treated by attraction, according to the gender of the governed noun; and it is unnecessary, with Rosenm. and others, to derive &#1504;&#1495;&#1514; from &#1504;&#1495;&#1514; (Aram. for &#1497;&#1512;&#1491;).<p>In <a href="//biblehub.com/job/36-17.htm">Job 36:17</a>, &#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503; is intended of Job's negative judgment concerning God and His dealings (comp. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/76-9.htm">Psalm 76:9</a>, where it signifies a judicial decision, and <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/22-10.htm">Proverbs 22:10</a>, where it signifies a wrangling refusal of a fair decision). <a href="/job/36-17.htm">Job 36:17</a> is not a conditional clause (Hahn), in which case the praet. hypothet. would have a prominent position, but an adversative predicative clause: but (nevertheless) thou art full of the judging of the evil-doer (evil judging); after which, just as &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2; as <a href="//biblehub.com/job/36-14.htm">Job 36:14</a>, the sad issue in which this judging after the manner of evil-doers results is expressed: such judging and judgment border closely upon one another. Rd., Dietr., and Schlottm. have wrongly reproduced this idea, discerned by Ges., when they translate: judgment and sentence (guilt and punishment) shall seize thee. &#1497;&#1514;&#1502;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;, prehendunt scil. se (Ebr.: put forth the hand), is used like the Aram. &#1505;&#1502;&#1498;, to draw nearer, fasten together (Rabb. &#1505;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498;, near at hand), Arab. tama&#770;saka (from Arab. msk  equals  &#1505;&#1502;&#1498;, as e.g., hanash  equals  &#1504;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;). In <a href="/job/36-18.htm">Job 36:18</a> we leave the signification thick milk or cream (&#1495;&#1502;&#1492;  equals  &#1495;&#1502;&#1488;&#1492;, as <a href="/job/29-6.htm">Job 29:6</a>) to those who persuade themselves that cream can be metaphorically equivalent to superfluity (Ew., Hirz., Vaih., Hlgst.). Renan's translation: N'espre pas dtourner la colre de Dieu par une amende, we also leave as a simple puzzle to its discoverer, who, with this one exception, is destitute of thoughts proper to the book of Job. In general, the thought, "do not imagine by riches, by a great ransom, to be able to satisfy the claims of God," is altogether out of place here. Moreover, &#1495;&#1502;&#1492;, which, as e.g., &#1491;&#1468;&#1488;&#1490;&#1492;, <a href="/proverbs/12-25.htm">Proverbs 12:25</a> (Ew. 174, g), is construed as masc., cannot be understood of God's wrath, since the poet by &#1492;&#1505;&#1497;&#1514; will not at one time have ascribed to God a well-meant incitation, at another an enticement in malam partem. That which allures is Job's own &#1495;&#1502;&#1492;, and that not the excitement of his affliction (Hahn), but of his passion; comp. &#1488;&#1507;, <a href="/job/36-13.htm">Job 36:13</a>. &#1513;&#1474;&#1508;&#1511; is, however, to be explained according to <a href="//biblehub.com/job/34-37.htm">Job 34:37</a>, comp. <a href="/job/27-23.htm">Job 27:23</a> (clapping of hands  equals  derision); and &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1512; signifies reconciliation or expiation, as <a href="/job/33-24.htm">Job 33:24</a>. Elihu admonishes Job not to allow himself to be drawn by the heat of passion into derision, or to deride; nor to be allured from the right way by the ransom which is required of him as the price of restoration to happiness, viz., humble submission to the divine chastisement, as though this ransom were exceeding great. The connection is clear: an adverse verdict (&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503;) and condemnation (&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;) are closely connected; for (&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;) hastiness of temper, let it not (&#1508;&#1468;&#1503;( ton ti ) lead thee astray ... thou wouldst not escape the judgment of God! </body></html>
