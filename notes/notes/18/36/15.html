He cautions him not to persist in frowardness. Even good men need to be kept to their duty by the fear of God's wrath; the wisest and best have enough in them to deserve his stroke. Let not Job continue his unjust quarrel with God and his providence. And let us never dare to think favourably of sin, never indulge it, nor allow ourselves in it. Elihu thinks Job needed this caution, he having chosen rather to gratify his pride and humour by contending with God, than to mortify them by submitting, and accepting the punishment. It is absurd for us to think to teach Him who is himself the Fountain of light, truth, knowledge, and instruction. He teaches by the Bible, and that is the best book; teaches by his Son, and he is the best Master. He is just in all proceedings.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/36.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He delivereth the poor in his affliction - Margin, "or afflicted." This accords better with the usual meaning of the Hebrew word (&#1506;&#1504;&#1497;  &#8219;a&#770;n&#305;&#770;y) and with the connection. The inquiry was not particularly respecting the "poor," but the "afflicted," and the sentiment which Elihu is illustrating is, that when the afflicted call upon God he will deliver them. The object is to induce Job to make such an application to God that he might be rescued from his calamities, and be permitted yet to enjoy life and happiness.<p>And openeth their ears - Causes them to understand the nature of his government, and the reasons why he visits them in this manner: compare <a href="//biblehub.com/job/33-16.htm">Job 33:16</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/33-23.htm">Job 33:23-27</a>. The sentiment here is a mere repetition of what Elihu had more than once before advanced. It is his leading thought; the "principle" on which he undertakes to explain the reason why God afflicts people, and by which he proposes to remove the difference between Job and his friends.<p>In oppression - This word expresses too much. It refers to God, and implies that there was something oppressive, harsh, or cruel in his dealings. This is not the idea of Elihu in the language which he uses. The word which he uses here (&#1500;&#1495;&#1509;  lachats) means "that which crushes"; then straits, distress. affliction. Jerome, "in tribulatione." The word "affliction" would express the thought. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/36.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15. poor&#8212;the afflicted pious.<p>openeth &#8230; ears&#8212;(Job 36:10); so as to be admonished in their straits ("oppression") to seek God penitently, and so be "delivered" (Job 33:16, 17, 23-27).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/job/36.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> i.e. Causeth them to hear, and understand, and do the will of God; hearing being oft put <span class="ital">for obeying</span>.

The righteous or godly poor; who are not only poor in worldly things, but poor in spirit; who are humbled, brought low, and made contrite, through the afflicting hand of God: these, though the Lord does sooner or later deliver "out" of their afflictions, yet that is not intended here, but a deliverance "in" them; which is done by supporting them under them, by supplying them with his grace to bear them patiently, by granting them his gracious presence for their comfort in them, by stilling the enemy and the avenger, keeping Satan from disturbing them, and freeing them from doubts and fears and unbelief, and by drawing their hearts and affections off of the world, and the things of it, to himself; <p>and openeth their ears in oppression; while they are oppressed; not only to discipline, correction, and instruction, <a href="/job/36-10.htm">Job 36:10</a>; but to hear comfortable words spoken, to them by the Lord; who, in the midst of their affliction and oppression, whispers in their ears, and tells them how he loves them, though they are rebuked and chastened by him; how he has chosen them to everlasting life and happiness, though now in the furnace of affliction; that he is their covenant God and Father, and knows and owns their souls in adversity that he has pardoned all their sins, though he takes vengeance on their inventions; and in a little time will free them from all their afflictions and oppressions. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/36.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">He delivereth the poor in his affliction, and openeth their ears in oppression.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/job/36.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">15</span>.

Elihu recurs to what he had said in ver. 10 with respect to the discipline of affliction. The bulk of the afflictions sent by God are, according to him, intended to act medicinally. If the afflicted man receives them aright, they are the very means of his deliverance (comp. <a href="/psalms/119-67.htm">Psalm 119:67, 71</a>; <a href="/hebrews/12-11.htm">Hebrews 12:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And openeth their ears in oppression</span>; rather, <span class="accented">by suffering.</span> Their sufferings lead them to God, cause them to pay more attention to his Word, lead them to open their ears to his inward voice. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/36.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>  8  And if they are bound with chains,<p>Holden in cords of affliction:<p>  9  Then He declareth to them their doing<p>And their transgressions, that they have been vainglorious;<p>10  Then He openeth their ear to warning,<p>And commandeth them to turn from iniquity.<p>The subj. is in no case the &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; (Hahn), but the &#1510;&#1491;&#1497;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501;, or those who are as susceptible to discipline as it is needful to them, just as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/107.htm">Psalm 107</a>, which in general presents many instances for an extensive comparison with the speeches of Elihu. The chains, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/36-8.htm">Job 36:8</a>, are meant literally, and the bands, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/36-8.htm">Job 36:8</a>, figuratively; the Psalmist couples both in &#1488;&#1505;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497; &#1506;&#1504;&#1497; &#1493;&#1489;&#1512;&#1494;&#1500;, <a href="/psalms/107-10.htm">Psalm 107:10</a>. The conclusion begins with <a href="//biblehub.com/job/36-9.htm">Job 36:9</a>, and is repeated in another application, <a href="/job/36-10.htm">Job 36:10</a>. &#1508;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500; in the sense of maleficium, as Arab. fa&#8219;alat, recalls &#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;, facinus, <a href="/job/33-17.htm">Job 33:17</a>. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/36-9.htm">Job 36:9</a>, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/36-10.htm">Job 36:10</a>, an objective quod.

The fundamental thought of Elihu here once again comes unmistakeably to view: the sufferings of the righteous are well-meant chastisements, which are to wean them from the sins into which through carnal security they have fallen - a warning from God to penitence, designed to work their good. </body></html>
