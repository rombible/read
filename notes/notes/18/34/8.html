The plainest Christian, whose mind is enlightened, whose heart is sanctified by the Spirit of God, and who is versed in the Scriptures, can say how far matters, words, or actions, agree with true religion, better than any that lean to their own understandings. Job had spoken as if he meant wholly to justify himself.

Job virtually goes in company (makes common cause) with the wicked, by taking up their sentiments (Job 9:22, 23, 30; 21:7-15), or at least by saying, that those who act on such sentiments are unpunished (Mal 3:14). To deny God's righteous government because we do not see the reasons of His acts, is virtually to take part with the ungodly.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/job/34.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Although I dare not say, as his three friends do, that he is a wicked man, yet in this matter he speaks and acts like one of them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/job/34.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity,.... The worst of men, who make it their constant business and employment to commit sin: <p>and walketh with wicked men; the most abandoned of mankind. Not that Job kept company with such, and walked with them in all excess of not; nor did Elihu think so; Job was "a man that feared God, and eschewed evil", and evil men; he was "a companion of them that feared the Lord"; his delight was "with the excellent of the earth": nor should a good man keep company and walk with the wicked, nor can he with any pleasure. But the sense is, that by his words, the expressions that dropped from his lips, he seemed to agree with them, and to be of the same sentiments with them; and what he delivered tended to encourage and harden them in their sinful ways; and what those words were follow. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/34.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Which goeth in <span class="cverse3">{g}</span> company with the workers of iniquity, and walketh with wicked men.</span><p>(g) Meaning that Job was like the wicked, because he seemed not to glorify God and submit himself to his judgments.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/job/34.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">8</span>.

It is impossible to supply any other antecedent to "which" than Job himself. Elihu therefore accuses Job of having turned aside from righteousness, and betaken himself to the "counsel of the ungodly, the way of sinners, and the seat of the scornful" (<a href="/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a>). This is grossly to exaggerate Job's faults of temper, and puts Elihu very nearly on a level with Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar in respect of misconception and rudeness. And walketh with wicked men. If no more is meant than that Job has adopted principles and arguments commonly used by wicked men (Canon Cook), the language employed is unfortunate. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/34.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>  1  Then began Elihu and said:<p>  2  Hear, ye wise men, my words,<p>And ye experienced ones, give ear to me!<p>  3  For the ear trieth words,<p>As the palate tasteth by eating.<p>  4  Let us find out what is right,<p>Let us explore among ourselves what is good.<p>After his first speech Elihu has made a brief pause; now since Job is silent, he begins anew. &#1493;&#1497;&#1506;&#1503; &#1493;&#1497;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;, lxx correctly, here as in all other instances where the phrase occurs: &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3c9;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;, taking up the word he said. The wise and the knowing (Arab. &#8219;ulama&#770;), whose attention he bespeaks, are not Job and the three (Umbr., Hahn), who are indeed a party, and as such a subject for the arbitrative appearance of Elihu; also not every one capable of forming a judgment (Hirz.); but those in the circle of spectators and listeners which, as is assumed, has assembled round the disputants (Schlottm.). In <a href="/job/33-4.htm">Job 33:4</a> Elihu does not expressly mean his own ear, but that of the persons addressed: he establishes his summons to prove what he says by the general thought brought over from <a href="//biblehub.com/job/12-11.htm">Job 12:11</a>, and as there (comp. <a href="/job/5-7.htm">Job 5:7</a>; <a href="/job/11-12.htm">Job 11:12</a>), clothed in the form of the emblematic proverb, - that as there is a bodily, so there is also a mental organ of sense which tries its perceptions. &#1500;&#1488;&#1499;&#1500; is not intended as expressing a purpose (ad vescendum), but as a gerundive (vescendo). The phrase &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1512; &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;, occurring only here, signifies neither to institute a search for the purpose of decision (Schult. and others), since &#1489;&#1495;&#1512; does not signify to decide upon anything, nor to investigate a cause (Hahn), which would be &#1504;&#1489;&#1495;&#1504;&#1492;, but to test and choose what is right, &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-21.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:21</a>, after which the parallel runs: cognoscamus inter nos (i.e., in common) quid bonum. </body></html>
