Here he shows, that God did him no wrong by afflicting him. If the former did not satisfy him, this ought to silence him. God cannot do wickedness, nor the Almighty commit wrong. If services now go unrewarded, and sins now go unpunished, yet there is a day coming, when God will fully render to every man according to his works. Further, though the believer's final condemnation is done away through the Saviour's ransom, yet he has merited worse than any outward afflictions; so that no wrong is done to him, however he may be tried.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/34.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Yea, surely God will not do wickedly - So important does Elihu hold this principle to be, that he repeats it, and dwells upon it. He says, "it surely (&#1488;&#1502;&#1504;&#1501;  'omna&#770;m) must be so." The principle must be held at all hazards, and no opinion which contravenes this should be indulged for one moment. His ground of complaint against Job was, that he had not held fast to this principle, but, under the pressure of his sufferings, had indulged in remarks which implied that God might do wrong.<p>Neither will the Almighty pervert judgment - As Elihu supposed Job to have maintained; see <a href="/job/34-5.htm">Job 34:5</a>. To "pervert judgment" is to do injustice; to place injustice in the place of right. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/34.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12.

This truth is repeated and affirmed in the strongest manner; or "will not condemn", as the Vulgate Latin version, and so the Targum, that is, he will not condemn the righteous; for, though he may afflict them, which is done that they may not be condemned with the world, he will not condemn them; for there is no condemnation to them that are in Christ; his righteousness, by which they are justified, secures them from all condemnation; <p>neither will the Almighty pervert judgment: pronounce a wrong sentence, decline the execution of justice, swerve from the rule of it, or do a wrong thing; for he punishes wherever he finds it, either in the sinner or his surety; and his punishing it in his Son, as the surety of his people, is the strongest proof of his punitive justice that can be given: nor does he neglect to chastise his people for sin, though satisfied for; so far is he from conniving at sin, and still further from committing it; see See Gill on <a href="/job/8-2.htm">Job 8:2</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/34.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/34.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment</span>.

That in spite of his right (&#1506;&#1500;, to be interpreted, according to Schultens' example, just like <a href="/job/10-7.htm">Job 10:7</a>; <a href="/job/16-17.htm">Job 16:17</a>), i.e., although right is on his side, yet he must be accounted a liar, since his own testimony is belied by the wrathful form of his affliction, that therefore the appearance of wrong remains inalienably attached to him, we find in idea in <a href="/job/9-20.htm">Job 9:20</a> and freq. Elihu makes Job call his affliction &#1495;&#1510;&#1468;&#1497;, i.e., an arrow sticking in him, viz., the arrow of the wrath of God (on the objective suff. comp. on <a href="/job/23-2.htm">Job 23:2</a>), after <a href="/job/6-4.htm">Job 6:4</a>; <a href="/job/16-9.htm">Job 16:9</a>; <a href="/job/19-11.htm">Job 19:11</a>; and that this his arrow, i.e., the pain which it causes him, is incurably bad, desperately malignant without (&#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497; as <a href="/job/8-11.htm">Job 8:11</a>) &#1508;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;, i.e., sins existing as the ground of it, from which he would be obliged to suppose they had thrust him out of the condition of favour, is Job's constant complaint (vid., e.g., <a href="/job/13-23.htm">Job 13:23</a>.). Another utterance of Job closely connected with it has so roused Elihu's indignation, that he prefaces it with the exclamation of astonishment: Who is a man like Job, i.e., where in all the world (&#1502;&#1497; as <a href="/2_samuel/7-23.htm">2 Samuel 7:23</a>) has this Job his equal, who ... . The attributive clause refers to Job; "to drink scorn (here: blasphemy) like water," is, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/job/15-16.htm">Job 15:16</a>, equivalent to to give one's self up to mockery with delight, and to find satisfaction in it. &#1488;&#1512;&#1495; &#1500;&#1495;&#1489;&#1512;&#1492;, to go over to any one's side, looks like a poeticized prose expression. &#1500;&#1500;&#1499;&#1514; is a continuation of the &#1488;&#1512;&#1495;, according to Ew. 351, c, but not directly in the sense "and he goes," but, as in the similar examples, <a href="/jeremiah/17-10.htm">Jeremiah 17:10</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/44-19.htm">Jeremiah 44:19</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-17.htm">2 Chronicles 7:17</a>, and freq., in the sense of: "he is in the act of going;" comp. on <a href="/job/36-20.htm">Job 36:20</a> and <a href="/habakkuk/1-17.htm">Habakkuk 1:17</a>. The utterance runs: a man does not profit, viz., himself (on the use of &#1505;&#1499;&#1503; of persons as well as of things, vid., on <a href="/job/22-2.htm">Job 22:2</a>), by his having joyous and familiar intercourse (&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1510;&#1514;&#1493;, as little equivalent to &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509; as in <a href="/psalms/50-18.htm">Psalm 50:18</a>) with God. Job has nowhere expressly said this, but certainly the declaration in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/9-22.htm">Job 9:22</a>, in connection with the repeated complaints concerning the anomalous distribution of human destinies (vid., especially <a href="//biblehub.com/job/21-7.htm">Job 21:7</a>, <a href="/job/24-1.htm">Job 24:1</a>), are the premises for such a conclusion. That Elihu, in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/34-7.htm">Job 34:7</a>, is more harsh against Job than the friends ever were (comp. e.g., the well-measured reproach of Eliphaz, <a href="/job/15-4.htm">Job 15:4</a>), and that he puts words into Job's moth which occur nowhere verbatim in his speeches, is worked up by the Latin fathers (Jer., Philippus Presbyter, Beda,<p>(Note: Philippus Presbyter was a disciple of Jerome. His Comm. in Iobum is extant in many forms, partly epitomized, partly interpolated (on this subject, vid., Hieronymi Opp. ed. Vallarsi, iii. 895ff.). The commentary of Beda, dedicated to a certain Nectarius (Vecterius), is fundamentally that of this Philippus.)<p>Gregory) in favour of their unfavourable judgment of Elihu; the Greek fathers, however, are deprived of all opportunity of understanding him by the translation of the lxx (in which &#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd; signifies the scorn of others which Job must swallow down, comp. <a href="/proverbs/26-6.htm">Proverbs 26:6</a>), which here perverts everything. </body></html>
