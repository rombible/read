Could he suppose that God was like those earthly princes, who hate right, who are unfit to rule, and prove the scourges of mankind? It is daring presumption to condemn God's proceedings, as Job had done by his discontents. Elihu suggests divers considerations to Job, to produce in him high thoughts of God, and so to persuade him to submit. Job had often wished to plead his cause before God. Elihu asks, To what purpose? All is well that God does, and will be found so. What can make those uneasy, whose souls dwell at ease in God? The smiles of all the world cannot quiet those on whom God frowns.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/34.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Is it fit to say to a king, Thou art wicked? - The argument here is this: "There would be gross impropriety in arraigning the conduct of an earthly monarch, and using language severely condemning what he does. Respect is due to those of elevated rank. Their plans are often concealed. It is difficult to judge of them until they are fully developed. To condemn those plans, and to use the language of complaint, would not be tolerated, and would be grossly improper. How much more so when that language relates to the Great, the Infinite God, and to his eternal plans!" It may be added here, in accordance with the sentiment of Elihu, that people often indulge in thoughts and language about God which they would not tolerate respecting an earthly monarch. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/34.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18. Literally, (Is it fit) to be said to a king? It would be a gross outrage to reproach thus an earthly monarch, much more the King of kings (Ex 22:28). But Maurer with the Septuagint and Vulgate reads, (It is not fit to accuse of injustice Him) who says to a king, Thou art wicked; to princes, Ye are ungodly; that is, who punishes impartially the great, as the small. This accords with Job 34:19.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/job/34.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Thou art wicked; </span> or, Thou art Belial, or a son of Belial.

Not even to a bad king; for though he may be reproved for his sins, yet not by any or everyone, but by a fit and proper person: and generally speaking, if not always, the Scriptural instances of reproving such kings are of men that were prophets, and sent in the name of the Lord to do it; and when done by them, was done with decency: and much less should this be said to a good king; as to say to him, Belial, the word here used; or thou art Belial; or a son of Belial, as Shimei said to David, <a href="/2_samuel/16-7.htm">2 Samuel 16:7</a>; a name given to the worst of men, and is the devil himself; and signifies either one without a yoke, or lawless, which a king is not; or unprofitable, whereas a king is a minister of God for good; is for the punishment of evildoers, and for a praise to them that do well; <p>and to princes, ye are ungodly? Who have their name from being generous, munificent, and liberal, and therefore should not be treated in such a manner; who are the sons of kings, or subordinate magistrates to them, and execute their will and pleasure, laws and precepts. And if now such language is not to be used to earthly kings and princes, then surely not to the King of kings and Lord of lords; so Jarchi interprets it of God the King of the world; and some Christian interpreters, as Schmidt, understand by "princes" the three Persons in the Godhead; which can hardly be made to bear: though, could the whole be understood of God in the three Persons of the Deity, the connection with <a href="/job/34-19.htm">Job 34:19</a> would run more smoothly without the supplement that is made; so Broughton, <p>"to the King, the King of nobles, that accepteth not,'' &amp;c. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/34.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><i>Is it fit</i> to say to a king, <i>Thou art</i> <span class="cverse3">{n}</span> wicked? <i>and</i> to princes, <i>Ye are</i> ungodly?</span><p>(n) If man by nature fears to speak evil of such as have power, then they should be much more afraid to speak evil of God.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/job/34.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">18</span>.

No doubt many kings, whether in the past or the present, might be justly enough addressed as “wicked,” and princes in abundance as “ungodly,” but the speaker is thinking here less of persons than of the offices which they fill as rulers.

Would he even tax those who stood next to the king - the princes and great officers of the court - with ungodliness? If a sense of what is becoming and seemly would restrain a man from the use of language of this sort towards his earthly ruler, can it be right that he should allow himself in such liberty or speech towards his heavenly King, his absolute Lord and Master? Job had not really used such language of God, though the complaints which he had made with respect to God's treatment of him might not unreasonably be held to imply some such accusation. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/34.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>12  Yea verily God acteth not wickedly,<p>And the Almighty perverteth not the right.<p>13  Who hath given the earth in charge to Him?<p>And who hath disposed the whole globe?<p>14  If He only set His heart upon Himself,<p>If He took back His breath and His inspiration to Himself:<p>15  All flesh would expire together,<p>And man would return to dust.<p>With &#1488;&#1507; &#1488;&#1502;&#1504;&#1501; (Yea verily, as <a href="//biblehub.com/job/19-4.htm">Job 19:4</a>, "and really") the counter-assertion of <a href="/job/34-11.htm">Job 34:11</a> is repeated, but negatively expressed (comp. <a href="/job/8-3.htm">Job 8:3</a>). &#1492;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1506; signifies sometimes to act as &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;, and at others to be set forth and condemned as a &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;; here, as the connection requires, it is the former. <a href="/job/34-13.htm">Job 34:13</a> begins the proof. Ewald's interpretation: who searcheth, and Hahn's: who careth for the earth beside Him, are hazardous and unnecessary. &#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1491; with &#1506;&#1500; of the person and the acc. of the thing signifies: to enjoin anything as a duty on any one, to entrust anything to any one, <a href="/job/36-23.htm">Job 36:23</a>; <a href="/numbers/4-27.htm">Numbers 4:27</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/36-23.htm">2 Chronicles 36:23</a>; therefore: who has made the earth, i.e., the care of it, a duty to Him? &#1488;&#1512;&#1510;&#1492; (Milel) is not to be refined into the meaning "to the earth" (as here by Schultens and a few others, <a href="/isaiah/9-1.htm">Isaiah 9:1</a> by Luzzatto: he hath smitten down, better: dishonoured, to the earth with a light stroke), but is poetically equivalent to &#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, as &#1500;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492; (comp. modern Greek &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;) is in prose equivalent to &#1500;&#1497;&#1500;. <a href="/job/34-13.htm">Job 34:13</a> is by no means, with Ew. and Hahn, to be translated: who observes (considers) the whole globe, &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1501; as <a href="/job/34-23.htm">Job 34:23</a>; <a href="/job/4-20.htm">Job 4:20</a>; <a href="/job/24-12.htm">Job 24:12</a> - the expression would be too contracted to affirm that no one but God bestowed providential attention upon the earth; and if we have understood <a href="/job/34-13.htm">Job 34:13</a> correctly, the thought is also inappropriate. A more appropriate thought is gained, if &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; is supplied from <a href="/job/34-13.htm">Job 34:13</a>: who has enjoined upon Him the whole circle of the earth (Saad., Gecat., Hirz., Schlottm.); but this continued force of the &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; into the second independent question is improbable in connection with the repetition of &#1502;&#1497;. Therefore: who has appointed, i.e., established (&#1513;&#1474;&#1501; as <a href="/job/38-5.htm">Job 38:5</a>; <a href="/isaiah/44-7.htm">Isaiah 44:7</a>), - a still somewhat more suitable thought, going logically further, since the one giving the charge ought to be the lord of him who receives the commission, and therefore the Creator of the world. This is just God alone, by whose &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; and &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1492; the animal world as well as the world of men (vid., <a href="/job/32-8.htm">Job 32:8</a>; <a href="/job/33-4.htm">Job 33:4</a>) has its life, <a href="/job/34-14.htm">Job 34:14</a> : if He should direct His heart, i.e., His attention (&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1501; &#1500;&#1489; &#1488;&#1500;, as <a href="/job/2-3.htm">Job 2:3</a>), to Himself (emphatic: Himself alone), draw in (&#1488;&#1505;&#1507; as <a href="/psalms/104-29.htm">Psalm 104:29</a>; comp. for the matter <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:7</a>, Psychol. S. 406) to Himself His inspiration and breath (which emanated from Him or was effected by Him), all flesh would sink together, i.e., die off at once (this, as it appears, has reference to the taking back of the animal life, &#1512;&#1493;&#1495;), and man would return (this has reference to the taking back of the human spirit, &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1492;) to dust (&#1506;&#1500; instead of &#1488;&#1500;, perhaps with reference to the usual use of the &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1506;&#1508;&#1512;, <a href="/job/17-16.htm">Job 17:16</a>; <a href="/job/20-11.htm">Job 20:11</a>; <a href="/job/21-26.htm">Job 21:26</a>).<p>Only a few modern expositors refer &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;, as Targ. Jer. and Syr., to man instead of reflexively to God; the majority rightly decide in favour of the idea which even Grotius perceived: si sibi ipsi tantum bonus esse (sui unius curam habere) vellet. &#1488;&#1501; followed by the fut. signifies either si velit (lxx &#x3b5;&#x3b9; &#787; &#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;), as here, or as more frequently, si vellet, <a href="/psalms/50-12.htm">Psalm 50:12</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/139-8.htm">Psalm 139:8</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/obadiah/1-4.htm">Obadiah 1:4</a>, <a href="/isaiah/10-22.htm">Isaiah 10:22</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/9-2.htm">Amos 9:2-4</a>. It is worthy of remark that, according to Norzi's statement, the Babylonian texts presented &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489;, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/34-14.htm">Job 34:14</a>, as Chethb, &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1501; as Ker (like our Palestine text, <a href="/daniel/11-18.htm">Daniel 11:18</a>), which a MS of De Rossi, with a Persian translation, confirms; the reading gives a fine idea: that God's heart is turned towards the world, and is unclosed; its ethical condition of life would then be like its physical ground of life, that God's spirit dwells in it; the drawing back of the heart, and the taking back to Himself of the spirit, would be equivalent to the exclusion of the world from God's love and life. However, &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1501; implies the same; for a reference of God's thinking and willing to Himself, with the exclusion of the world, would be just a removal of His love. Elihu's proof is this: God does not act wrongly, for the government of the world is not a duty imposed upon Him from without, but a relation entered into freely by Him: the world is not the property of another, but of His free creative appointment; and how unselfishly, how devoid of self-seeking He governs it, is clear from the fact, that by the impartation of His living creative breath He sustains every living thing, and does not, as He easily might, allow them to fall away into nothingness. There is therefore a divine love which has called the world into being and keeps it in being; and this love, as the perfect opposite of sovereign caprice, is a pledge for the absolute righteousness of the divine rule. </body></html>
