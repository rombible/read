Could he suppose that God was like those earthly princes, who hate right, who are unfit to rule, and prove the scourges of mankind? It is daring presumption to condemn God's proceedings, as Job had done by his discontents. Elihu suggests divers considerations to Job, to produce in him high thoughts of God, and so to persuade him to submit. Job had often wished to plead his cause before God. Elihu asks, To what purpose? All is well that God does, and will be found so. What can make those uneasy, whose souls dwell at ease in God? The smiles of all the world cannot quiet those on whom God frowns.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/34.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Because they turned back from him - Margin, "from after him." That is, they receded, or went away from God.<p>And would not consider any of his ways - They would not regard or attend to any of his commands. The word way, in the Scriptures, is often used to denote "religion." A "way" denotes the course of life which one leads; the path in which he walks. The "ways of God" denote his course or plan, his precepts or laws; and to depart from them, or to disregard them, is only another mode of saying that a man has no religion. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/34.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>27, 28.

Became apostates from the ways and worship of God, as the posterity of Cain before the flood, and the posterity of Ham after it; who had been educated and trained up therein, and turned from the law of God, as the Septuagint version, from the light and law of nature: <p>and would not consider any of his ways; either of providence, whether in a way of mercy which might lead to repentance, or in a way of judgment which might be a caution and instruction to them; or of his precepts, the way of his commandments, not any of these would they consider; so as to express a value for them, show any regard to them, and walk in them; and which was owing to the stubbornness of their wills; they would not advert to them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/34.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his ways:</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/34.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Because they turned back from him</span> (On the sin of "turning back," see <a href="/2_kings/17-15.htm">2 Kings 17:15, 16</a>; <a href="/proverbs/26-11.htm">Proverbs 26:11</a>; <a href="/2_peter/2-22.htm">2 Peter 2:22</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">And would not consider any of his ways</span> (comp. <a href="/psalms/28-5.htm">Psalm 28:5</a>; <a href="/isaiah/5-12.htm">Isaiah 5:12</a>).

Thou shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me: for that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the Lord: they would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof.
