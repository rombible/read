Job's friends would have had him own himself a wicked man. Let will only oblige him to own that he spoke unadvisedly with his lips. Let us, in giving reproof, not make a matter worse than it is. Elihu directs Job to humble himself before God for his sins, and to accept the punishment. Also to pray to God to discover his sins to him. A good man is willing to know the worst of himself; particularly, under affliction, he desires to be told wherefore God contends with him. It is not enough to be sorry for our sins, but we must go and sin no more. And if we are affectionate children, we shall love to speak with our Father, and to tell him all our mind. Elihu reasons with Job concerning his discontent under affliction. We are ready to think every thing that concerns us should be just as we would have it; but it is not reasonable to expect this. Elihu asks whether there was not sin and folly in what Job said. God is righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works, Ps 145:17. The believer saith, Let my Saviour, my wise and loving Lord, choose every thing for me. I am sure that will be wisest, and the best for his glory and my good.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/34.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Let men of understanding - Margin, as in Hebrew "heart." The "heart," as there has been frequent occasions to remark, in the Scriptures is often used to denote the seat of the mind or soul, as the head is with us. Rosenmuller, Umbreit, and Noyes, render this passage as if it were to be taken in connection with the following verse, "Men of understanding will say, and a wise man who hears my views will unite in saying, 'Job has spoken without knowledge, and his words are without wisdom.'" According to this, the two verses express a sentiment in which Elihu supposes every wise man who had attended to him would concur, that what Job had said was not founded in knowledge or on true wisdom. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/34.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>34, 35.

The conjecture &#1497;&#1512;&#1506;&#1513;&#1473;<p>(Note: Vid., Grtz in Frankel's Monatsschrift, 1861, i.)<p>is not required either here or <a href="/1_samuel/14-47.htm">1 Samuel 14:47</a> (where &#1492;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1506; signifies to punish the guilty); &#1497;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; is also not to be translated turbabit (Rosenm.), since &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; (Arab. rs&#8219;, rsg) according to its primitive notion does not signify "to be restless, to rage," but "to be relaxed, hollow" (opposite of &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;, Arab. s&#803;dq, to be hard, firm, tight). Further: If God hides His countenance, i.e., is angry and punishes, who can then behold Him, i.e., make Him, the veiled One, visible and claim back the favour withdrawn? The Waw of &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;, if one marks off the periods of the paratactic expression, is in both cases the Waw of conclusion after hypothetical antecedents, and. <a href="/job/34-29.htm">Job 34:29</a> refers to Job's impetuous challenging of God. Thus exalted above human controversy and defiance, God rules both over the mass and over individuals alike. &#1497;&#1495;&#1491; gives intensity of the equality thus correlatively (et-et) expressed (Targ., Syr.); to refer it to &#1488;&#1491;&#1501; as generalizing (lxx, Jer. et super omnes homines), is forbidden by the antithesis of peoples and individuals. To the thought, that God giveth rest (from oppressors) and hides His countenance (from the oppressors and in general those who act wrongly), two co-ordinate negative final clauses are attached: in order that godless men may not rule (&#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1498;, as e.g., <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/23-33.htm">2 Kings 23:33</a>, Keri), in order that they may no longer be (&#1502;( e  equals  &#1502;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514;, under the influence of the notion of putting aside contained in the preceding final clause, therefore like <a href="/isaiah/7-8.htm">Isaiah 7:8</a> &#1502;&#1506;&#1501;, <a href="/isaiah/24-2.htm">Isaiah 24:2</a> &#1502;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512;, <a href="/jeremiah/48-2.htm">Jeremiah 48:2</a> &#1502;&#1490;&#1493;&#1497;, and the like) snares of the people, i.e., those whose evil example and bad government become the ruin of the community.<p>In <a href="/job/34-31.htm">Job 34:31</a> the view of those who by some jugglery concerning the laws of the vowel sounds explain &#1492;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; as imper. Niph. ( equals  &#1492;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;), be it in the sense of &#1500;&#1492;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;, dicendum est (Rosenm., Schlottm., and others, after Raschi), or even in the unheard-of reflexive signification: express thyself (Stick., Hahn), is to be rejected. The syncopated form of the infin. &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1512;&#1490;, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/26-15.htm">Ezekiel 26:15</a>, does not serve as a palliation of this adventurous imperative. It is, on the contrary, &#1488;&#1502;&#1512; with &#1492; interrog., as <a href="/ezekiel/28-9.htm">Ezekiel 28:9</a> &#1492;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;, and probably also &#1492;&#1506;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; <a href="/micah/2-7.htm">Micah 2:7</a> (vid., Hitz.). A direct exhortation to Job to penitence would also not be in place here, although what Elihu says is levelled against Job. The &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; is confirmatory. Thus God acts with that class of unscrupulous men who abuse their power for the destruction of their subjects: for he (one of them) says (or: has said, from the standpoint of the execution of punishment) to God, etc. Ew. differently: "for one says thus to God even: I expiate what I do not commit," by understanding the speech quoted of a defiance which reproachfully demands an explanation. It is, however, manifestly a compendious model confession. And since Elihu with &#1499;&#1497; establishes the execution of punishment from this, that it never entered the mind of the &#1506;&#1491;&#1501; &#1495;&#1504;&#1507; thus to humble himself before God, so &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1514;&#1497; here cannot signify: I have repented (put up with and had to bear what I have deserved); on the contrary, the confession begins with the avowal: I have exalted myself (&#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;, se efferre, in <a href="/hosea/13-1.htm">Hosea 13:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/89-10.htm">Psalm 89:10</a>), which is then followed by the vow: I will not (in the future) do evil (&#1495;&#1489;&#1500; synon. &#1506;&#1493;&#1492;, as <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/1-7.htm">Nehemiah 1:7</a>, and probably also supra, <a href="/job/24-9.htm">Job 24:9</a>), and the entreaty, <a href="/job/34-32.htm">Job 34:32</a> : beside that which I behold (elliptical object-clause, Ew. 333, b), i.e., what lies beyond my vision ( equals  &#1504;&#1505;&#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; or &#1506;&#1500;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="/psalms/19-13.htm">Psalm 19:13</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/90-8.htm">Psalm 90:8</a>, unacknowledged sins), teach me; and the present vow has reference to acknowledged sins and sins that have still to be acknowledged: if I have done wrong, I will do it no more. Thus speaking - Elihu means - those high ones might have anticipated the punishment of the All-just God, for favour instead of wrath cannot be extorted, it is only reached by the way of lowly penitence. </body></html>
