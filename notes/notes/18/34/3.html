The plainest Christian, whose mind is enlightened, whose heart is sanctified by the Spirit of God, and who is versed in the Scriptures, can say how far matters, words, or actions, agree with true religion, better than any that lean to their own understandings. Job had spoken as if he meant wholly to justify himself. He that say, I have cleansed my hands in vain, does not only offend against God's children, Ps 73:13-15, but gratifies his enemies, and says as they say.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/34.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For the ear trieth words - Ascertains their meaning, and especially determines what words are worth regarding. The object of this is, to fix the attention on what he was about to say; to get the ear so that every word should make its proper impression. The word ear in this place, however, seems not to be used to denote the external organ, but the whole faculty of hearing. It is by hearing that the meaning of what is said is determined, as it is by the taste that the quality of food is discerned.<p>As the mouth tasteth meat - Margin, as in Hebrew "palate." The meaning is, as the organ of taste determines the nature of the various articles of food.

Not only the musical sound of them, the goodness of the language and diction, and the grammatical construction of them, but the sense of them, and whether the matter of them is good or not; that they are sound speech, which cannot be condemned, or unsound; whether they are right or wrong, agreeably to right reason, sound doctrine, and the word of God; for there are words and words, some the words of men, others the words of God. A sanctified ear tries these; but then men must have such ears to hear, and be attentive to what they hear, and retain it; hear internally as well as externally; and which a man does when his ears are opened by the Lord, from whom are the hearing ear and seeing eye; and such try what they hear, distinguish between good and bad, approve truth and receive it, and retain and hold it fast: <p>as the mouth tasteth meat; words and doctrines are like meat, some good and some bad; and such that have a good taste try them, either a rational or rather a spiritual discernment: some have no spiritual taste, their taste is not changed, and therefore cannot distinguish, nor make any good judgment of things; but others have, and these discern the difference, relish truth, savour the things that be of God, taste the good word of God, and esteem it more than their necessary food; and it is sweeter to them than the honey or the honeycomb. Such Elihu judged these men to be he addressed, and therefore desired their attention to what he had to say. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/34.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/job/34.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">3</span>. Elihu makes his appeal to his hearers <span class="ital">for</span> the ear trieth words. His appeal is to the common reason, or to the common reverent and just thoughts of God in men. The “ear” is the inner ear, the understanding, which is a judge of sentiments as much as, or like as, the palate is a judge of meats, ch. <a href="/job/12-11.htm" title="Does not the ear try words? and the mouth taste his meat?">Job 12:11</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/34.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat</span>. A proverbial expression, already used by Job in the dialogue (<a href="/job/12-11.htm">Job 12:11</a>). "It is as much the business of the ear to discriminate between wise and foolish words, as of the palate to distinguish between wholesome and unwholesome food." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/33.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>29  Behold, God doeth all<p>Twice, thrice with man,<p>30  To bring back his soul from the pit,<p>That it may become light in the light of life.<p>31  Listen, O Job, hearken to me;<p>Be silent and let me speak on.<p>32  Yet if thou hast words, answer me;<p>Speak, for I desire thy justification.<p>33  If not, hearken thou to me;<p>Be silent and I will teach thee wisdom.<p>After having described two prominent modes of divine interposition for the moral restoration and welfare of man, he adds, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/33-29.htm">Job 33:29</a>, that God undertakes (observe the want of parallelism in the distich, <a href="/job/33-29.htm">Job 33:29</a>) everything with a man twice or thrice (asyndeton, as e.g., <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/17-6.htm">Isaiah 17:6</a>, in the sense of bis terve) in order to bring back his soul from the pit (&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1514;, here for the fifth time in this speech, without being anywhere interchanged with &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1500; or another synonym, which is remarkable), that it, having hitherto been encompassed by the darkness of death, may be, or become, light (&#1500;&#1488;&#1493;&#1512;, inf. Niph., syncopated from &#1500;&#1492;&#1488;&#1493;&#1512;, Ew. 244, b) in the light of life (as it were bask in the new and restored light of life) - it does not always happen, for these are experiences of no ordinary kind, which interrupt the daily course of life; and it is not even repeated again and again constantly, for if it is without effect the first time, it is repeated a second or third time, but it has an end if the man trifles constantly with the disciplinary work of grace which designs his good. Finally, Elihu calls upon Job quietly to ponder this, that he may proceed; nevertheless, if he has words, i.e., if he thinks he is able to advance any appropriate objections, he is continually to answer him (&#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489; with acc. of the person, as <a href="/job/33-5.htm">Job 33:5</a>), for he (Elihu) would willingly justify him, i.e., he would gladly be in the position to be able to acknowledge Job to be right, and to have the accusation dispensed with. Hirz. and others render falsely: I wish thy justification, i.e., thou shouldst justify thyself; in this case &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498; ought to be supplied, which is unnecessary: &#1495;&#1508;&#1509;, without a change of subject, has the inf. constr. here without &#1500;, as it has the inf. absol. in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/13-3.htm">Job 13:3</a>, and &#1510;&#1491;&#1468;&#1511; signifies to vindicate (as <a href="/job/32-2.htm">Job 32:2</a>), or acknowledge to be in the right (as the Piel of &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;, <a href="/job/33-12.htm">Job 33:12</a>), both of which are blended here.

If it is not so (&#1488;&#1501;&#1470;&#1488;&#1497;&#1503; as <a href="/genesis/30-1.htm">Genesis 30:1</a>), viz., that he does not intend to defend himself with reference to his expostulation with God on account of the affliction decreed for him, he shall on his part (&#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;) listen, shall be silent and be further taught wisdom.<p>Quasi hac ratione Heliu sanctum Iob convicerit! exclaims Beda, after a complete exposition of this speech. He regards Elihu as the type of the false wisdom of the heathen, which fails to recognise and persecutes the servant of God: Sunt alii extra ecclesiam, qui Christo ejusque ecclesiae similiter adversantur, quorum imaginem praetulit Balaam ille ariolus, qui et Elieu sicut patrum traditio habet (Balaam and Elihu, one person - a worthless conceit repeated in the Talmud and Midrash), qui contra ipsum sanctum Iob multa improbe et injuriose locutus est, in tantum ut etiam displiceret in una ejus et indisciplinata loquacitas.<p>(Note: Bedae Opp. ed. Basil. iii. col. 602f. 786. The commentary also bears the false name of Jerome Hieronymus, and as a writing attributed to him is contained in tom. v. Opp. ed.
