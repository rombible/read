Could he suppose that God was like those earthly princes, who hate right, who are unfit to rule, and prove the scourges of mankind? It is daring presumption to condemn God's proceedings, as Job had done by his discontents. Elihu suggests divers considerations to Job, to produce in him high thoughts of God, and so to persuade him to submit. Job had often wished to plead his cause before God. Elihu asks, To what purpose? All is well that God does, and will be found so. What can make those uneasy, whose souls dwell at ease in God? The smiles of all the world cannot quiet those on whom God frowns.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/34.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Therefore he knoweth their works - Or, "Because he knoweth their works." The word (&#1500;&#1499;&#1503;  la&#772;ke&#770;n) here rendered "therefore" is evidently used as denoting that since or because he was intimately acquainted with all which they did, he could justly bring vengeance upon them without long investigation.<p>And he overturneth them in the night - literally, "he turneth night;" meaning, probably, he turns night upon them; that is, he brings calamity upon them. The word "night" is often used to denote calamity, or ruin. Umbreit understands it in the sense of "turning about the night;" that is, that they had covered up their deeds as in the night, but that God "so turns the night about" as to bring them to the light of day. The Vulgate renders it "et ideireo inducit noctem," "and therefore he brings night;" that is, he brings adversity and ruin. This is probably the correct interpretation.<p>So that they are destroyed - Margin, "crushed." The idea is, that when God thus brings adversity upon them, they are prostrated beneath his power. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/34.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>25.

In <a href="/job/34-20.htm">Job 34:20</a> Elihu appeals to human history in favour of this impartiality of the Ruler of the world. It may there appear as though God with partiality suffered rulers and peoples in authority in the world to do as they please; but suddenly they die away, and in fact in the middle of the night (here Mercha-mahpach), the individuals of a great people (thus must &#1506;&#1501; be understood in accordance with the prominently-placed plur. predicate, Ges. 146, 1) tremble and perish; and they remove (&#1493;&#1497;&#1505;&#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; instead of the passive, as <a href="/job/4-20.htm">Job 4:20</a> and frequently) the mighty - &#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1489;&#1497;&#1491;.

The subj. of <a href="/job/34-20.htm">Job 34:20</a> are the previously mentioned princes. The division according to the accents may be received with hesitation, since the symmetry of the sticks, which it restores, is not unfrequently wanting in the Elihu section. <a href="/job/34-20.htm">Job 34:20</a> refers back to the possessors of power, and in the interval, <a href="/job/34-20.htm">Job 34:20</a> describes the fate of those who belong to the people which has become subservient to their lust of conquest, for &#1506;&#1501; cannot signify "in crowds" (Ew., Hahn); it is therefore, and especially when mentioned as here between princes and rulers, the people, and in fact, in distinction from gwy, the people together forming a state. </body></html>
