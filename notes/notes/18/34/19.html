Could he suppose that God was like those earthly princes, who hate right, who are unfit to rule, and prove the scourges of mankind? It is daring presumption to condemn God's proceedings, as Job had done by his discontents. Elihu suggests divers considerations to Job, to produce in him high thoughts of God, and so to persuade him to submit. Job had often wished to plead his cause before God. Elihu asks, To what purpose? All is well that God does, and will be found so. What can make those uneasy, whose souls dwell at ease in God? The smiles of all the world cannot quiet those on whom God frowns.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/34.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>How much less to him that accepteth not the person of princes - To accept the person of anyone is to treat him with special favor on account of his rank, his wealth, or from favoritism and partiality. This God often disclaims in respect to himself; (compare <a href="/galatians/2-6.htm">Galatians 2:6</a>; <a href="/acts/10-34.htm">Acts 10:34</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/19-7.htm">2 Chronicles 19:7</a>; <a href="/romans/2-11.htm">Romans 2:11</a>; <a href="/ephesians/6-9.htm">Ephesians 6:9</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-25.htm">Colossians 3:25</a>), and solemnly forbids it in others; see <a href="//biblehub.com/james/2-1.htm">James 2:1</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/james/2-3.htm">James 2:3</a>,<a href="/james/2-9.htm">James 2:9</a>; <a href="/leviticus/19-15.htm">Leviticus 19:15</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/1-17.htm">Deuteronomy 1:17</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/16-19.htm">Deuteronomy 16:19</a>. The meaning here is, that God is entirely impartial in his administration, and treats all as they ought to be treated. He shows favor to no one on account of wealth, rank, talent, office, or joyous apparel, and he excludes no one from favor on account of poverty, ignorance, or a humble rank in life. This it seems was an admitted sentiment in the time of Elihu, and on the ground of the fact that it was indisputable, he strongly argues the impropriety of calling in question the equity of his administration in language such as that which Job had used.<p>For they all are the work of his hands - He regards them all as his creatures. No one has any special claim on him on account of rank, talent, or wealth. Every creature that he has made, high and low, rich and poor, bond and free, may expect that impartial justice will be done him, and that his external circumstances will not control or modify the divine determinations in regard to him, or the divine dealings toward him. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/34.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19.

Partiality or injustice is not to be thought of in God, for all men, rich and poor, are alike the work of His hands.

All classes of men, rich and poor, powerful and weak, are equally God's creatures, brought into the world by him, given by him their several stations, and regarded by him with favour or disfavour, according as they conduct themselves in their various occupations and employments. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/34.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>12  Yea verily God acteth not wickedly,<p>And the Almighty perverteth not the right.<p>13  Who hath given the earth in charge to Him?<p>And who hath disposed the whole globe?<p>14  If He only set His heart upon Himself,<p>If He took back His breath and His inspiration to Himself:<p>15  All flesh would expire together,<p>And man would return to dust.<p>With &#1488;&#1507; &#1488;&#1502;&#1504;&#1501; (Yea verily, as <a href="//biblehub.com/job/19-4.htm">Job 19:4</a>, "and really") the counter-assertion of <a href="/job/34-11.htm">Job 34:11</a> is repeated, but negatively expressed (comp. <a href="/job/8-3.htm">Job 8:3</a>). &#1492;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1506; signifies sometimes to act as &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;, and at others to be set forth and condemned as a &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;; here, as the connection requires, it is the former. <a href="/job/34-13.htm">Job 34:13</a> begins the proof. Ewald's interpretation: who searcheth, and Hahn's: who careth for the earth beside Him, are hazardous and unnecessary. &#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1491; with &#1506;&#1500; of the person and the acc. of the thing signifies: to enjoin anything as a duty on any one, to entrust anything to any one, <a href="/job/36-23.htm">Job 36:23</a>; <a href="/numbers/4-27.htm">Numbers 4:27</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/36-23.htm">2 Chronicles 36:23</a>; therefore: who has made the earth, i.e., the care of it, a duty to Him? &#1488;&#1512;&#1510;&#1492; (Milel) is not to be refined into the meaning "to the earth" (as here by Schultens and a few others, <a href="/isaiah/9-1.htm">Isaiah 9:1</a> by Luzzatto: he hath smitten down, better: dishonoured, to the earth with a light stroke), but is poetically equivalent to &#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, as &#1500;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492; (comp. modern Greek &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;) is in prose equivalent to &#1500;&#1497;&#1500;. <a href="/job/34-13.htm">Job 34:13</a> is by no means, with Ew. and Hahn, to be translated: who observes (considers) the whole globe, &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1501; as <a href="/job/34-23.htm">Job 34:23</a>; <a href="/job/4-20.htm">Job 4:20</a>; <a href="/job/24-12.htm">Job 24:12</a> - the expression would be too contracted to affirm that no one but God bestowed providential attention upon the earth; and if we have understood <a href="/job/34-13.htm">Job 34:13</a> correctly, the thought is also inappropriate. A more appropriate thought is gained, if &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; is supplied from <a href="/job/34-13.htm">Job 34:13</a>: who has enjoined upon Him the whole circle of the earth (Saad., Gecat., Hirz., Schlottm.); but this continued force of the &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; into the second independent question is improbable in connection with the repetition of &#1502;&#1497;.

This is just God alone, by whose &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; and &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1492; the animal world as well as the world of men (vid., <a href="/job/32-8.htm">Job 32:8</a>; <a href="/job/33-4.htm">Job 33:4</a>) has its life, <a href="/job/34-14.htm">Job 34:14</a> : if He should direct His heart, i.e., His attention (&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1501; &#1500;&#1489; &#1488;&#1500;, as <a href="/job/2-3.htm">Job 2:3</a>), to Himself (emphatic: Himself alone), draw in (&#1488;&#1505;&#1507; as <a href="/psalms/104-29.htm">Psalm 104:29</a>; comp. for the matter <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:7</a>, Psychol.

Jer. and Syr., to man instead of reflexively to God; the majority rightly decide in favour of the idea which even Grotius perceived: si sibi ipsi tantum bonus esse (sui unius curam habere) vellet. &#1488;&#1501; followed by the fut. signifies either si velit (lxx &#x3b5;&#x3b9; &#787; &#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;), as here, or as more frequently, si vellet, <a href="/psalms/50-12.htm">Psalm 50:12</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/139-8.htm">Psalm 139:8</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/obadiah/1-4.htm">Obadiah 1:4</a>, <a href="/isaiah/10-22.htm">Isaiah 10:22</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/9-2.htm">Amos 9:2-4</a>. It is worthy of remark that, according to Norzi's statement, the Babylonian texts presented &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489;, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/34-14.htm">Job 34:14</a>, as Chethb, &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1501; as Ker (like our Palestine text, <a href="/daniel/11-18.htm">Daniel 11:18</a>), which a MS of De Rossi, with a Persian translation, confirms; the reading gives a fine idea: that God's heart is turned towards the world, and is unclosed; its ethical condition of life would then be like its physical ground of life, that God's spirit dwells in it; the drawing back of the heart, and the taking back to Himself of the spirit, would be equivalent to the exclusion of the world from God's love and life. However, &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1501; implies the same; for a reference of God's thinking and willing to Himself, with the exclusion of the world, would be just a removal of His love. Elihu's proof is this: God does not act wrongly, for the government of the world is not a duty imposed upon Him from without, but a relation entered into freely by Him: the world is not the property of another, but of His free creative appointment; and how unselfishly, how devoid of self-seeking He governs it, is clear from the fact, that by the impartation of His living creative breath He sustains every living thing, and does not, as He easily might, allow them to fall away into nothingness. There is therefore a divine love which has called the world into being and keeps it in being; and this love, as the perfect opposite of sovereign caprice, is a pledge for the absolute righteousness of the divine rule. </body></html>
