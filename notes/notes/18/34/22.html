Could he suppose that God was like those earthly princes, who hate right, who are unfit to rule, and prove the scourges of mankind? It is daring presumption to condemn God's proceedings, as Job had done by his discontents. Elihu suggests divers considerations to Job, to produce in him high thoughts of God, and so to persuade him to submit. Job had often wished to plead his cause before God. Elihu asks, To what purpose? All is well that God does, and will be found so. What can make those uneasy, whose souls dwell at ease in God? The smiles of all the world cannot quiet those on whom God frowns.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/34.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>There is no darkness - No dark cavern which can furnish a place of concealment. The guilty usually take refuge in some obscure place where people cannot detect them. But Elihu says that man has no power of concealing himself thus from God.<p>Nor shadow of death - A phrase here signifying deep darkness; see it explained in the notes at <a href="/job/3-5.htm">Job 3:5</a>.<p>Where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves - That is, where they may conceal themselves so as not to be detected by God. They may conceal themselves from the notice of man; they may escape the most vigilant police; they may elude all the officers of justice on earth. But they cannot be hid from God. There is an eye that sees their lurking places, and there is a hand that will drag them forth to justice. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/34.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22. shadow of death&#8212;thick darkness (Am 9:2, 3; Ps 139:12).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/job/34.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> They may flatter themselves, or cheat others, by covering their wicked actions with plausible pretences and professions; but they cannot deceive God, nor keep their hearts and ways from his sight. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/job/34.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves. By whom may be meant chiefly profane sinners that are abandoned to a vicious course of life, and make a trade of sin, or that the common course of their lives; though secret sinners, and even professors of religion, hypocrites, who in a more private manner live in sin, come under this name, <a href="/matthew/7-23.htm">Matthew 7:23</a>; such may endeavour to hide themselves through shame and fear, but all in vain and to no purpose; there is no screening themselves and their actions from the all-seeing eye of God, and from his wrath and vengeance. "No darkness" of any sort can hide them, not the thick clouds of the heavens, nor the darkness of the night; nor is there any darkness in God that can obstruct his sight of them; nor are they able to cast any mist before his eyes, or use any colourings, pretences, and excuses he cannot see through. "Nor shadow of death": the grossest and thickest darkness; nor is even the grave itself an hiding place for sinners, from whence they will be raised to receive the just deserts of their sins. See <a href="/job/10-21.htm">Job 10:21</a>. Now from the omniscience of God, and his clear uninterrupted sight of all persons and their actions, inward and outward, Elihu argues to the justice of God, who therefore cannot do anything amiss through ignorance, error, or mistake. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/34.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/34.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves</span>. "All things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do" (<a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>). However careful wicked men may be to conceal their misdeeds by "waiting for the twilight" (<a href="/job/24-15.htm">Job 24:15</a>), or doing them "in the dark" (<a href="/job/24-16.htm">Job 24:16</a>), they will find it quite impossible to escape the all-seeing eye of the Almighty, which is as clear-sighted in the deepest darkness as in the brightest light ("Yea, the darkness is no darkness with thee, but the night is as clear as the day; the darkness and light to thee are both alike," <a href="/psalms/139-11.htm">Psalm 139:11</a>, Prayer-book Version). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/34.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>16  And oh understand now, hear this;<p>Hearken to the sound of my words.<p>17  Would one who hateth right also be able to subdue?<p>Or wilt thou condemn the All-just?<p>18  Is it becoming to say to a king: Worthless One!?<p>Thou evil-doer! to princes?<p>19  To Him who accepteth not the person of rulers,<p>And regardeth not the noble before the poor:<p>For they are all the work of His hands.<p>20  In a moment they die, and at midnight<p>The people are overthrown and perish,<p>And they put aside the mighty - not by the hand of man.<p>This strophe contains several grammatical rarities. At first sight it appears that <a href="/job/34-16.htm">Job 34:16</a> ought to be translated: "and if there is understanding (viz., to thee  equals  if thou hast), then hear this." But &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492; is accented as Milel and with Mercha, and can therefore not be a substantive (Hirz., Hahn, and others); for the retreat of the accent would be absolutely incomprehensible, and instead of a conjunctive, a distinctive, viz., Dech, ought to be expected. Several of the old expositors, therefore, interpret with Nolde: quod quum ita sit, intellige; but this elliptical &#1493;&#1488;&#1501;, well as it might also be used for <a href="//biblehub.com/job/21-4.htm">Job 21:4</a>, is unsupportable; the Makkeph between the two words is also against it, which rather arises from the assumption that &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492; is the imperat., and &#1488;&#1501; as an exception, like <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/23-13.htm">Genesis 23:13</a>, is an optative particle joined to the imper. 2 instead of to the fut.: "and if thou shouldst observe" ( equals  &#1493;&#1488;&#1501;&#1470;&#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1503;). To translate <a href="/job/34-17.htm">Job 34:17</a> with Schultens: num iram osor judicii frenabit, is impracticable on account of the order of the words, and gives a thought that is inappropriate here. &#1488;&#1507; is a particle, and the fut. is potentialis: is it also possible that an enemy of right should govern? (&#1495;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473;, imperio coercere, as &#1488;&#1510;&#1512;   <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-17.htm">1 Samuel 9:17</a>, &#1488;&#1505;&#1512; <a href="/psalms/105-22.htm">Psalm 105:22</a>); right and government are indeed mutually conditioned, without right everything would fall into anarchy and confusion. In <a href="/job/34-17.htm">Job 34:17</a> this is applied to the Ruler of the world: or (&#1493;&#1488;&#1501;, an, as <a href="/job/8-3.htm">Job 8:3</a>; <a href="/job/21-4.htm">Job 21:4</a>; <a href="/job/40-9.htm">Job 40:9</a>) wilt thou condemn the mighty just One, i.e., the All-just? As Elihu calls God &#1513;&#1474;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1488; &#1499;&#1495;, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/37-23.htm">Job 37:23</a>, as the Almighty, and as the Omniscient One, &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1491;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/37-16.htm">Job 37:16</a>, so here as the All-just One, &#1510;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1511; &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;.
