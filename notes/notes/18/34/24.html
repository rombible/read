Could he suppose that God was like those earthly princes, who hate right, who are unfit to rule, and prove the scourges of mankind? It is daring presumption to condemn God's proceedings, as Job had done by his discontents. Elihu suggests divers considerations to Job, to produce in him high thoughts of God, and so to persuade him to submit. Job had often wished to plead his cause before God. Elihu asks, To what purpose? All is well that God does, and will be found so. What can make those uneasy, whose souls dwell at ease in God? The smiles of all the world cannot quiet those on whom God frowns.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/34.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He shall break in pieces - He crushes or destroys the great. He is not intimidated by their wealth, their rank, or their number.<p>Without number - Margin, more correctly, "searching out." That is, he does it without the protracted process of a judicial investigation. The Hebrew word used here (&#1495;&#1511;&#1512;  che&#770;qer) means properly "a searching out," "an examination"; and the meaning here is, that there is no need of his going into a protracted investigation into the lives of wicked people before he brings them to punishment. He sees them at once; knows all their conduct, and may proceed against them without delay. Hence, it is that he comes often in such a sudden manner, and cuts them off. A human tribunal is under a necessity of examining witnesses and of attending to all the palliating circumstances, before it can pronounce a sentence on an offender. But it is not so with God. He judges at once and directly, and comes forth therefore in a sudden manner to cut down the guilty.<p>And set others in their stead - Place others in the situation which they now occupy. That is, he can with the utmost case make entire revolutions among people. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/34.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24. break in pieces&#8212;(Ps 2:9; Job 12:18; Da 2:21).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/job/34.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Mighty men without number; </span> neither their greatness nor their numbers can secure them from the stroke of God’s justice. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Set others in their stead, </span> i.e. give away their power and dignity to others who shall come in their place. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/job/34.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>He shall break in pieces mighty men without number,.... Such as are mighty in bodily strength, as the giants of the old world, and such as were inhabitants of some parts of the land of Canaan; or mighty in power and authority, being kings, princes, rulers, and governors, over nations and cities; or mighty in wealth and riches, which give men power and strength; these God can and sometimes does break in pieces like potters' vessels, and even mighty kingdoms and nations themselves he will make like the chaff of the summer threshing floor: and even without number; or there have been and will be numberless instances of this kind; who can tell how many of these mighty men, men of gigantic stature, were drowned in the flood, or cut off by the sword of the Israelites in the land of Canaan? or "without search" (d) as it may be rendered; either on the part of God, who needs not any, with whom are unnecessary any formal inquiries into a cause, or examination of witnesses, in order to a judicial process against delinquents, all being naked and open before him at once; or on the part of man, with whom the ways and judgments of God are unsearchable and who ought not closely and curiously to inquire into any of his proceedings, and the causes and reasons of them, who does all things after the counsel of his own will. Mr. Broughton renders it "without end", for ever; with an everlasting destruction, an utter and irretrievable one; he so breaks them as that they never can be made whole again, like an earthen vessel that is broke to pieces and cannot be put together again; <p>and set others in their stead; God always provides for a succession in the world, that as when one generation goes off another comes on; when he destroyed the world with a flood, he preserved a family to replenish the earth; when the fathers of the Jewish nation, their carcasses fell in the wilderness, their children were raised up in their room to enter the good land and possess it; and particularly he provides for the civil government of the world and when he pulls down or removes one king he sets up another, and will not suffer kingdoms and states to fall into anarchy and confusion: and sometimes, when he casts down the mighty from their seats, he exalts men of low degree, as when he rejected Saul he took David from the sheepfold, <a href="/1_samuel/16-11.htm">1 Samuel 16:11</a>; and makes such kings and kingdoms to "stand" (e) stable and firm, as the kingdom of David, and as the word here used signifies. <p>(d)  "absque inquisitione", Beza, Mercerus; "sine investigatione", Michaelis; so Cocceius, Schultens.

Thou evil-doer! to princes?" The reading &#1492;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; is an unnecessary lightening of the difficulty. It were a crimen laesae, if one reproached a king with being unjust, and therefore thereby denied him the most essential requisite of a ruler; and now even Him (Merc. correctly supplies tanto minus ei) who does not give the preference to the person (&#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488; &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; as <a href="/job/13-8.htm">Job 13:8</a>; <a href="/job/32-21.htm">Job 32:21</a>) of princes, and does not (with preference) regard (on &#1504;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512; vid., on <a href="//biblehub.com/job/21-29.htm">Job 21:29</a>, also here Piel, and according to the statement of the Masora, Milel, for an acknowledged reason which can be maintained even in remarkable instances, like <a href="/deuteronomy/10-5.htm">Deuteronomy 10:5</a> in &#1493;&#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;, <a href="/ezekiel/32-26.htm">Ezekiel 32:26</a> in &#1502;&#1495;&#1500;&#1500;&#1497;, whereas <a href="/1_samuel/23-7.htm">1 Samuel 23:7</a> is Milra) the rich before (&#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497; in the sense of prae) the poor! therefore the King of kings, who makes no partial distinction, because the king and the beggar are the work of His hands: they stand equally near to Him as being His creatures, and He is exalted above both alike as their Creator, this order and partiality are excluded; - what a nota bene against the doctrine of the decretum absolutum, which makes the love of the Creator a partial love, and turns this love, which in its very nature is perfect love, into caprice! In <a href="/job/34-20.htm">Job 34:20</a> Elihu appeals to human history in favour of this impartiality of the Ruler of the world. It may there appear as though God with partiality suffered rulers and peoples in authority in the world to do as they please; but suddenly they die away, and in fact in the middle of the night (here Mercha-mahpach), the individuals of a great people (thus must &#1506;&#1501; be understood in accordance with the prominently-placed plur. predicate, Ges. 146, 1) tremble and perish; and they remove (&#1493;&#1497;&#1505;&#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; instead of the passive, as <a href="/job/4-20.htm">Job 4:20</a> and frequently) the mighty - &#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1489;&#1497;&#1491;. It is not the hand of man which does this, but an invisible higher power (which, if it is called yd, only bears this name per anthropomorphismum); comp. <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/2-34.htm">Daniel 2:34</a>, &#1500;&#1488; &#1489;&#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1503;; <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/8-25.htm">Daniel 8:25</a>, &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1508;&#1505; &#1497;&#1491;; and also <a href="//biblehub.com/job/20-26.htm">Job 20:26</a>, like the New Testament use of &#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#787; &#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;. The subj. of <a href="/job/34-20.htm">Job 34:20</a> are the previously mentioned princes. The division according to the accents may be received with hesitation, since the symmetry of the sticks, which it restores, is not unfrequently wanting in the Elihu section. <a href="/job/34-20.htm">Job 34:20</a> refers back to the possessors of power, and in the interval, <a href="/job/34-20.htm">Job 34:20</a> describes the fate of those who belong to the people which has become subservient to their lust of conquest, for &#1506;&#1501; cannot signify "in crowds" (Ew., Hahn); it is therefore, and especially when mentioned as here between princes and rulers, the people, and in fact, in distinction from gwy, the people together forming a state. </body></html>
