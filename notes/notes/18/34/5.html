Not in express words, but what amounted to it: no doubt he was a righteous man in an evangelic sense, being justified by the righteousness of Christ, as all the Old Testament saints were, who looked to him and believed in him as the Lord their righteousness, and said, as the church in those times did, "surely in the Lord have I righteousness and strength"; <a href="/isaiah/45-24.htm">Isaiah 45:24</a>. And moreover he was an upright man, to which the Lord himself bore testimony, <a href="/job/1-8.htm">Job 1:8</a>; and had the truth of grace in him, that "new man which is created in righteousness and true holiness"; and also lived an holy life and conversation; but then he did not say or think that he was righteous in or of himself, or so as to be free from sin: Job could not judge or speak thus of himself, which would be contrary to what he expressly declares, <a href="/job/7-20.htm">Job 7:20</a>; though it must be owned, that he thought himself so righteous, holy, and good, that he ought not to have been afflicted in the manner he was; in which sense it is probable Elihu understood him: and besides, these words are not to be taken separately, but in connection with what follows, which shows Job's sense, and how Elihu understood him, that though he was a righteous person, he had not justice done him: <p>and God hath taken away my judgment; which words he did say; see Gill on <a href="/job/27-2.htm">Job 27:2</a>; or, as Mr. Broughton renders the words, "the Omnipotent keeps back my right"; does not vindicate my cause, nor so much as give it a hearing, nor lets me know why he contends with me; and, though I call for justice to be done, cannot be heard, <a href="/job/19-7.htm">Job 19:7</a>; a like complaint of the church in <a href="/isaiah/40-27.htm">Isaiah 40:27</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/job/34.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> away my judgment.</span><p>(c) That is, has afflicted me without measure.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/job/34.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5</span>. <span class="ital">I am righteous</span>] Or, <span class="ital">in the right</span>, I have right on my side.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">my judgment</span>] As before means <span class="ital">my right</span>, what is rightly due to me—God has dealt with me unjustly; comp. <a href="/job/9-15.htm" title="Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer, but I would make supplication to my judge.">Job 9:15</a>; <a href="/job/9-20.htm" title="If I justify myself, my own mouth shall condemn me: if I say, I am perfect, it shall also prove me perverse.">Job 9:20</a>, <a href="/job/13-18.htm" title="Behold now, I have ordered my cause; I know that I shall be justified.">Job 13:18</a>, <a href="/job/27-2.htm" title="As God lives, who has taken away my judgment; and the Almighty, who has vexed my soul;">Job 27:2</a>; <a href="/job/27-6.htm" title="My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: my heart shall not reproach me so long as I live.">Job 27:6</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">5–9</span>.

Job had maintained his "righteousness" in a certain sense, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his integrity, his honesty, his conviction that God would ultimately acquit him; but he had not maintained his sinlessness (see the comment on Job 33:9). He had not even said, in so many words, "I am righteous." The nearest that he had come to saying it was when (in <a href="/job/13-18.htm">Job 13:18</a>) he had exclaimed, "I know that I shall be held righteous," or "justified." <span class="cmt_word">And God hath taken away my judgment</span>. Job had said this (<a href="/job/27-2.htm">Job 27:2</a>), but in the sense that God had withheld from him the judgment on his cause which he desired, not that he had perverted judgment, and wrongfully condemned him (see the 'Speaker's Commentary,' vol. 4. p. 97).  <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/33.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>29  Behold, God doeth all<p>Twice, thrice with man,<p>30  To bring back his soul from the pit,<p>That it may become light in the light of life.<p>31  Listen, O Job, hearken to me;<p>Be silent and let me speak on.<p>32  Yet if thou hast words, answer me;<p>Speak, for I desire thy justification.<p>33  If not, hearken thou to me;<p>Be silent and I will teach thee wisdom.<p>After having described two prominent modes of divine interposition for the moral restoration and welfare of man, he adds, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/33-29.htm">Job 33:29</a>, that God undertakes (observe the want of parallelism in the distich, <a href="/job/33-29.htm">Job 33:29</a>) everything with a man twice or thrice (asyndeton, as e.g., <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/17-6.htm">Isaiah 17:6</a>, in the sense of bis terve) in order to bring back his soul from the pit (&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1514;, here for the fifth time in this speech, without being anywhere interchanged with &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1500; or another synonym, which is remarkable), that it, having hitherto been encompassed by the darkness of death, may be, or become, light (&#1500;&#1488;&#1493;&#1512;, inf. Niph., syncopated from &#1500;&#1492;&#1488;&#1493;&#1512;, Ew. 244, b) in the light of life (as it were bask in the new and restored light of life) - it does not always happen, for these are experiences of no ordinary kind, which interrupt the daily course of life; and it is not even repeated again and again constantly, for if it is without effect the first time, it is repeated a second or third time, but it has an end if the man trifles constantly with the disciplinary work of grace which designs his good. Finally, Elihu calls upon Job quietly to ponder this, that he may proceed; nevertheless, if he has words, i.e., if he thinks he is able to advance any appropriate objections, he is continually to answer him (&#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489; with acc. of the person, as <a href="/job/33-5.htm">Job 33:5</a>), for he (Elihu) would willingly justify him, i.e., he would gladly be in the position to be able to acknowledge Job to be right, and to have the accusation dispensed with. Hirz. and others render falsely: I wish thy justification, i.e., thou shouldst justify thyself; in this case &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498; ought to be supplied, which is unnecessary: &#1495;&#1508;&#1509;, without a change of subject, has the inf. constr. here without &#1500;, as it has the inf. absol. in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/13-3.htm">Job 13:3</a>, and &#1510;&#1491;&#1468;&#1511; signifies to vindicate (as <a href="/job/32-2.htm">Job 32:2</a>), or acknowledge to be in the right (as the Piel of &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;, <a href="/job/33-12.htm">Job 33:12</a>), both of which are blended here.

If it is not so (&#1488;&#1501;&#1470;&#1488;&#1497;&#1503; as <a href="/genesis/30-1.htm">Genesis 30:1</a>), viz., that he does not intend to defend himself with reference to his expostulation with God on account of the affliction decreed for him, he shall on his part (&#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;) listen, shall be silent and be further taught wisdom.<p>Quasi hac ratione Heliu sanctum Iob convicerit! exclaims Beda, after a complete exposition of this speech. He regards Elihu as the type of the false wisdom of the heathen, which fails to recognise and persecutes the servant of God: Sunt alii extra ecclesiam, qui Christo ejusque ecclesiae similiter adversantur, quorum imaginem praetulit Balaam ille ariolus, qui et Elieu sicut patrum traditio habet (Balaam and Elihu, one person - a worthless conceit repeated in the Talmud and Midrash), qui contra ipsum sanctum Iob multa improbe et injuriose locutus est, in tantum ut etiam displiceret in una ejus et indisciplinata loquacitas.<p>(Note: Bedae Opp. ed. Basil. iii. col. 602f. 786. The commentary also bears the false name of Jerome Hieronymus, and as a writing attributed to him is contained in tom. v. Opp. ed.
