In this chapter several animals are spoken of, whose nature or situation particularly show the power, wisdom, and manifold works of God. The wild ass. It is better to labour and be good for something, than to ramble and be good for nothing. From the untameableness of this and other creatures, we may see, how unfit we are to give law to Providence, who cannot give law even to a wild ass's colt. The unicorn, a strong, stately, proud creature. He is able to serve, but not willing; and God challenges Job to force him to it. It is a great mercy if, where God gives strength for service, he gives a heart; it is what we should pray for, and reason ourselves into, which the brutes cannot do. Those gifts are not always the most valuable that make the finest show. Who would not rather have the voice of the nightingale, than the tail of the peacock; the eye of the eagle and her soaring wing, and the natural affection of the stork, than the beautiful feathers of the ostrich, which can never rise above the earth, and is without natural affection? The description of the war-horse helps to explain the character of presumptuous sinners. Every one turneth to his course, as the horse rushes into the battle. When a man's heart is fully set in him to do evil, and he is carried on in a wicked way, by the violence of his appetites and passions, there is no making him fear the wrath of God, and the fatal consequences of sin. Secure sinners think themselves as safe in their sins as the eagle in her nest on high, in the clefts of the rocks; but I will bring thee down from thence, saith the Lord, #Jer 49:16". All these beautiful references to the works of nature, should teach us a right view of the riches of the wisdom of Him who made and sustains all things. The want of right views concerning the wisdom of God, which is ever present in all things, led Job to think and speak unworthily of Providence.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/39.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Her young ones also suck up blood - The word used here (&#1497;&#1506;&#1500;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;  ye&#8219;a&#770;l&#8219;u&#770;) occurs nowhere else in the Scriptures. It is supposed to mean, to sup up greedily; referring to the fact that the young ones of the eagle devour blood voraciously. They are too feeble to devour the flesh, and hence, they are fed on the blood of the victim. The strength of the eagle consists in the beak, talons, and wings; and such is their power, that they are able to convey animals of considerable size, alive, to their places of abode. They often bear away in this manner, lambs, kids, and the young of the gazelle. Three instances, at least, are known, where they have carried off children. In the year 1737, in Norway, a boy upward of two years of age was carried off by an eagle in the sight of his parents. Anderson, in his history of Iceland, asserts that in that island children of four and five years of age have experienced the same fate; and Ray mentions that in one of the Orkheys an infant of a year old was seized in the talons of an eagle, and conveyed about four miles to its eyry. "Edin. Ency." The principal food of the young eagle is blood. The proof of this fact may be seen in Scheutzer's "Phys. Sac., in loc."<p>And where the slain are, there is she - Hebrew, "the slain;" referring perhaps primarily to a field of battle - where horses, camels, and human beings, lie in confusion. It is not improbable that the Savior had this passage in view when he said, speaking of the approaching destruction of Jerusalem, "For wheresoever the carcase is, there will the eagles be gathered together; "Mat 24:28. Of the fact that they thus assemble, there can be no doubt. The "argument" in proof of the wisdom and majesty of the Almighty in these references to the animal creation, is derived from their strength, their instincts, and their special habits. We may make two remarks, in view of the argument as here stated:<p>(1) One relates to the remarkable accuracy with which they are referred to. The statements are not vague and general, but are minute and characteristic, about the habits and the instincts of the animals referred to. The very things are selected which are now known to distinguish those animals, and which are not found to exist in the same degree, if at all, in others. Subsequent investigations have served to confirm the accuracy of these descriptions, and they may be taken now as a correct account even to the letter of the natural history of the different animals referred to. If, therefore, as has already been stated, this is to be regarded as an indication of the state of natural science in the time of Job. it shows quite an advanced state; if it is not an indication of the existing state of knowledge in his time, if there was no such acquaintance with the animal creation as the result of observation, then it shows that these were truly the words of God, and are to be regarded as direct inspiration. At all events, the statement was evidently made under the influence of inspiration, and is worthy of the origin which it claims.<p>(2) The second remark is, that the progress of discovery in the science of natural history has only served to confirm and expand the argument here adverted to. Every new fact in regard to the habits and instincts of animals is a new proof of the wisdom and greatness of God and we may appeal now, with all the knowledge which we have on these subjects, with unanswerable force to the habits and instincts of the wild goats of the rock, the wild ass, the rhinoceros, the ostrich, the horse, the hawk, and the eagle, as each one furnishing some striking and special proof of the wisdom, goodness, superintending providence and power of the great Creator. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/39.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>30. Quoted partly by Jesus Christ (Mt 24:28). The food of young eagles is the blood of victims brought by the parent, when they are still too feeble to devour flesh.<p>slain&#8212;As the vulture chiefly feeds on carcasses, it is included probably in the eagle genus.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/job/39.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Blood; </span> either of the prey which the eagle hath brought to her nest for them, or of that which themselves catch and kill, being betimes inured to this work by their dams.

As well as herself, being brought up to it by her. The eagle cares not for water, but drinks the blood of her prey; and so her young ones after her, as naturalists report (w). And Aelianus says (x) the same of the hawk, that it eats no seeds, but devours flesh and drinks blood, and nourishes her young ones with the same. <p>And where the slain are, there is she; where there has been a battle, and carcasses left on the field, the eagles will gather to them. This is particularly true of that kind of eagles called vulture eagles, as Aristotle (y) and Pliny (z) observe; see <a href="/matthew/24-28.htm">Matthew 24:28</a>. Now since Job was so ignorant of the nature of these creatures, and incapable of governing and directing them; and what they had of any excellency were of God, and not of him, nor of any man; how unfit must he be to dispute with God, and contend with him about his works of providence? which to convince him of was the design of this discourse about the creatures; and which had its intended effect, as appears in the next chapter. <p>(w) Aristot. de Animal. l. 8. c. 3. 18.

It has been asserted that this is not the case, since they are fed on carrion (Merx).

Eagles, or at any rate birds "more resembling eagles than vultures," are commonly represented on the Assyrian monuments, especially in battle-scenes, where they either feed on the dead bodies of the slain, or tear out their entrails, or sometimes carry up aloft the decapitated head of some unfortunate soldier (see the 'Transactions of the Society of Biblical Archaeology' vol. 8. p. 59, and pls. 2. and 3.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/39.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The motion of the horse, which is intended by &#1514;&#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; (&#1512;&#1506;&#1513;&#1473;, Arab. r&#8219;s, r&#8219;s&#780;, tremere, trepidare), is determined according to the comparison with the grasshopper: what is intended is a curved motion forwards in leaps, now to the right, now to the left, which is called the caracol, a word used in horsemanship, borrowed from the Arab. hargala-l-farasu (comp. &#1495;&#1512;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500;), by means of the Moorish Spanish; moreover, Arab. r&#8219;s is used of the run of the ostrich and the flight of the dove in such "successive lateral and oblique motions" (Carey). nachar, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/39-20.htm">Job 39:20</a>, is not the neighing of the horse, but its snorting through the nostrils (comp.

Here haw&#305;&#770;d signifies the sound of the bells which those who wish to announce themselves as warriors hang about their horses, to draw the attention of the enemy to them. Mubershema&#770;t are the mares that carry the bure&#770;shima&#770;n, i.e., the bells. The meaning therefore is: thou couldst hear this sound, which ought only to be heard in the fray, in flight, when the warriors consecrated to death fled as cowards. Taijr (Te&#770;ja&#770;r) is Slih the son of Cana'an (died about 1815), mentioned in p. 456, note 1, a great warrior of the wandering tribe of the 'Aneze. - Wetzst.)<p>The substantival clause is intended to affirm that its dull-toned snort causes or spreads terror. In <a href="/job/39-21.htm">Job 39:21</a> the plur. alternates with the sing., since, as it appears, the representation of the many pawing hoofs is blended with that of the pawing horse, according to the well-known line,<p>Quadrupedante putrem sonitu quatit ungula campum<p>(Virgil, Aen. viii. 596);<p>or, since this is said of the galloping horse, according to the likewise Virgilian line,<p>Cavatque<p>Tellurem, et solido graviter sonat ungula cornu<p>(Georg. iii. 87 f).<p>&#1495;&#1508;&#1512; is, as the Arab. ha&#770;fir, hoof, shows, the proper word for the horse's impatient pawing of the ground (whence it then, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/39-29.htm">Job 39:29</a>, signifies rimari, scrutari). &#1506;&#1502;&#1511; is the plain as the place of contest; for the description, as now becomes still more evident, refers to the war-horse. The verb &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1513;&#1474; (&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;) has its radical signification exsultare (comp. Arab. s]ts, skirta'n, of the foetus) here; and since &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1495;, not &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1495;, is added to it, it is not to be translated: it rejoices in its strength, but: it prances or is joyous with strength, lxx &#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#834;&#837; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x399;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b9;&#836;. The difference between the two renderings is, however, scarcely perceptible. &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;, armament, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/39-21.htm">Job 39:21</a>, is meton. the armed host of the enemy; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1492;, "the quiver," is, however, not used metonymically for the arrows of the enemy whizzing about the horse (Schult.), but <a href="/job/39-23.htm">Job 39:23</a> is the concluding description of the horse that rushes on fearlessly, proudly, and impetuously in pursuit, under the rattle and glare of the equipment of its rider (Schlottm. and others). &#1512;&#1504;&#1492; (cogn. of &#1512;&#1504;&#1503;), of the rattling of the quiver, as Arab. ranna, ranima, of the whirring of the bow when the arrow is despatched; to point it &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; (<a href="/proverbs/1-20.htm">Proverbs 1:20</a>; <a href="/proverbs/8-3.htm">Proverbs 8:3</a>), instead of &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1504;&#1492;, would be to deprive the language of a word supported by the dialects (vid., Ges. Thes.). On <a href="/job/39-24.htm">Job 39:24</a> we may compare the Arab. iltahama-l-farasu-l-arda, the horse swallows up the ground, whence lahimm, lah&#305;&#770;m, a swallower  equals  swift-runner; so here: with boisterous fierceness and angry impatience (&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1506;&#1513;&#1473; &#1493;&#1512;&#1490;&#1494;) it swallows up the ground, i.e., passes so swiftly over it that long pieces vanish so rapidly before it, as though it greedily sucked them up (&#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1488; intensive of &#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1488;, whence &#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1488;, the water-sucking papyrus); a somewhat differently applied figure is nahab-el-arda, i.e., according to Silius' expression, rapuit campum. The meaning of <a href="/job/39-24.htm">Job 39:24</a> is, as in Virgil, Georg. iii.:83f.:<p>Tum si qua sonum procul arma dedere,<p>Stare loco nescit;<p>and in Aeschylus, Septem, 375: &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#788;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; (Hermann, &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; (impatiently awaiting the call of the trumpet). &#1492;&#1488;&#1502;&#1497;&#1503; signifies here to show stability (vid., Genesis, S. 367f.) in the first physical sense (Bochart, Rosenm., and others): it does not stand still, i.e., will not be held, when (&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, quum) the sound of the war-trumpet, i.e., when it sounds. &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1508;&#1512; is the signal-trumpet when the army was called together, e.g., <a href="/judges/3-27.htm">Judges 3:27</a>; to gather the army that is in pursuit of the enemy, <a href="/2_samuel/2-28.htm">2 Samuel 2:28</a>; when the people rebelled, <a href="/2_samuel/20-1.htm">2 Samuel 20:1</a>; when the army was dismissed at the end of the war, <a href="/2_samuel/20-22.htm">2 Samuel 20:22</a>; when forming for defence and for assault, e.g., <a href="/amos/3-6.htm">Amos 3:6</a>; and in general the signal of war, <a href="/jeremiah/4-19.htm">Jeremiah 4:19</a>. As often as this is heard (&#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;, in sufficiency, i.e., happening at any time  equals  quotiescunque), it makes known its lust of war by a joyous neigh, even from afar, before the collision has taken place; it scents (praesagit according to Pliny's expression) the approaching conflict, (scents even in anticipation) the thundering command of the chiefs that may soon be heard, and the cry of battle giving loose to the assault. "Although," says Layard (New Discoveries, p. 330), "docile as a lamb, and requiring no other guide than the halter, when the Arab mare hears the war-cry of the tribe, and sees the quivering spear of her rider, her eyes glitter with fire, her blood-red nostrils open wide, her neck is nobly arched, and her tail and mane are raised and spread out to the wind. The Bedouin proverb says, that a high-bred mare when at full speed should hide her rider between her neck and her tail." </body></html>
