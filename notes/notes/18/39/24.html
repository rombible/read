In this chapter several animals are spoken of, whose nature or situation particularly show the power, wisdom, and manifold works of God. The wild ass. It is better to labour and be good for something, than to ramble and be good for nothing. From the untameableness of this and other creatures, we may see, how unfit we are to give law to Providence, who cannot give law even to a wild ass's colt. The unicorn, a strong, stately, proud creature. He is able to serve, but not willing; and God challenges Job to force him to it. It is a great mercy if, where God gives strength for service, he gives a heart; it is what we should pray for, and reason ourselves into, which the brutes cannot do. Those gifts are not always the most valuable that make the finest show. Who would not rather have the voice of the nightingale, than the tail of the peacock; the eye of the eagle and her soaring wing, and the natural affection of the stork, than the beautiful feathers of the ostrich, which can never rise above the earth, and is without natural affection? The description of the war-horse helps to explain the character of presumptuous sinners. Every one turneth to his course, as the horse rushes into the battle. When a man's heart is fully set in him to do evil, and he is carried on in a wicked way, by the violence of his appetites and passions, there is no making him fear the wrath of God, and the fatal consequences of sin. Secure sinners think themselves as safe in their sins as the eagle in her nest on high, in the clefts of the rocks; but I will bring thee down from thence, saith the Lord, #Jer 49:16". All these beautiful references to the works of nature, should teach us a right view of the riches of the wisdom of Him who made and sustains all things. The want of right views concerning the wisdom of God, which is ever present in all things, led Job to think and speak unworthily of Providence.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/39.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He swalloweth the ground - He seems as if he would absorb the earth. That is, he strikes his feet into it with such fierceness, and raises up the dust in his prancing, as if he would devour it. This figure is unusual with us, but it is common in the Arabic. See Schultens, "in loc.," and Bochart, "Hieroz," P. i. L. ii. c. viii. pp. 143-145. So Statius:<p>Stare loco nescit, pereunt vestigia mille<p>Ante fugam, absentemque ferit gravis ungula campum.<p>Th' impatient courser pants in every' vein,<p>And pawing seems to beat the distant plain;<p>Hills, vales, and floods, appear already cross'd,<p>And ere he starts a thousand steps are lost.<p>Pope<p>Neither believeth he that it is the sound of the trumpet - This translation by no means conveys the meaning of the original. The true sense is probably expressed by Umbreit. "He standeth not still when the trumpet soundeth; "that is, he becomes impatient; he no longer confides in the voice of the rider and remains submissive, but he becomes excited by the martial clangor, and rushes into the midst of the battle. The Hebrew word which is employed (&#1497;&#1488;&#1502;&#1497;&#1503;  ya'a&#770;miyn) means properly "to prop, stay, support"; then "to believe, to be firm, stable"; and is that which is commonly used to denote an act of "faith," or as meaning "believing." But the original sense of the word is here to be retained, and then it refers to the fact that the impatient horse no longer stands still when the trumpet begins to sound for battle. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/39.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24. swalloweth&#8212;Fretting with impatience, he draws the ground towards him with his hoof, as if he would swallow it.

Mr. Broughton and others read it, "he will not stand still at the noise of the trumpet"; and the word signifies firm and stable, as well as to believe; when he hears the trumpet sound, the alarm of war, as a preparation for the battle, he knows not how to (a) stand; there is scarce any holding him in, but he rushes into the battle at once, <a href="/jeremiah/8-6.htm">Jeremiah 8:6</a>. <p>(a) "Stare loco nescit".

This is a common metaphor to denote the rapidity with which the horse covers the space that lies before him. Virgil has, "Corripiuut spatia" ('AEnid,' 5:316); Silius ltalions, "Campum volatu rapucre" (3:308); Shakespeare, "He seemed in running to devour the way."

(So Schultens, Canon Cook, and our Revisers.)

Jer. translates correctly according to the sense: quasi non sint sui, but &#1500; is not directly equivalent to &#1499;&#1468;; what is meant is, that by the harshness of her conduct she treats her young as not belonging to her, so that they become strange to her, Ew. 217, d. In <a href="/job/39-16.htm">Job 39:16</a> the accentuation varies: in vain (&#1500;&#1512;&#1497;&#1511; with Rebia mugrasch) is her labour that is devoid of anxiety; or: in vain is her labour (&#1500;&#1512;&#1497;&#1511;( ruobal r with Tarcha, &#1497;&#1490;&#1497;&#1506;&#1492;&#1468; with Munach vicarium) without anxiety (on her part); or: in vain is her labour (&#1500;&#1512;&#1497;&#1511; with Mercha, &#1497;&#1490;&#1497;&#1506;&#1492; with Rebia mugrasch), yet she is without anxiety. The middle of these renderings (&#1500;&#1512;&#1497;&#1511; in all of them, like <a href="/isaiah/49-4.htm">Isaiah 49:4</a>  equals  &#1500;&#1512;&#1497;&#1511;, <a href="/isaiah/65-23.htm">Isaiah 65:23</a> and freq.) seems to us the most pleasing: the labour of birth and of the brooding undertaken in places where the eggs are put beyond the danger of being crushed, is without result, without the want of success distressing her, since she does not anticipate it, and therefore also takes no measures to prevent it. The eggs that are only just covered with earth, or that lie round about the nest, actually become a prey to the jackals, wild-cats, and other animals; and men can get them for themselves one by one, if they only take care to prevent their footprints being recognised; for if the ostrich observes that its nest is discovered, it tramples upon its own eggs, and makes its nest elsewhere (Schlottm., according to Lichtenstein's Sdafrik. Reise). That it thus abandons its eggs to the danger of being crushed and to plunder, arises, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/job/39-17.htm">Job 39:17</a>, from the fact that God has caused it to forget wisdom, i.e., as <a href="/job/39-17.htm">Job 39:17</a> explains, has extinguished in it, deprived it of, the share thereof (&#1489; as <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/53-12.htm">Isaiah 53:12</a>, lxx &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;, as <a href="/acts/8-21.htm">Acts 8:21</a>) which it might have had. It is only one of the stupidities of the ostrich that is made prominent here; the proverbial ahmaq min en-na&#8219;a&#770;me, "more foolish than the ostrich," has its origin in more such characteristics. But if the care with which other animals guard their young ones is denied to it, it has in its stead another remarkable characteristic: at the time when (&#1499;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514; here followed by an elliptical relative clause, which is clearly possible, just as with &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514;, <a href="/job/6-17.htm">Job 6:17</a>) it stretches (itself) on high, i.e., it starts up with alacrity from its ease (on the radical signification of &#1492;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1488;  equals  &#1492;&#1502;&#1512;&#1492;), and hurries forth with a powerful flapping of its wings, half running half flying, it derides the horse and its rider - they do not overtake it, it is the swiftest of all animals; wherefore Arab. '&#8219;da&#770; mn 'l-dl&#305;&#770;m &#8219;zal&#305;&#770;m, equivalent to del&#305;&#770;m according to a less exact pronunciation, supra, p. 582, note) and Arab. 'nfr mn 'l-n&#8219;a&#770;mt, fleeter than the ostrich, is just as proverbial as the above Arab. 'h&#803;mq mn 'l-wa&#8219;nat; and "on ostrich's wings" is equivalent to driving along with incomparable swiftness. Moreover, on &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1488; and &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1495;&#1511;, which refer to the female, it is to be observed that she is very anxious, and deserts everything in her fright, while the male ostrich does not forsake his young, and flees no danger.<p>(Note: We take this remark from Doumas, Horse of the Sahara. The following contribution from Wetzstein only came to hand after the exposition was completed: "The female ostriches are called &#1512;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; not from the whirring of their wings when flapped about, but from their piercing screeching cry when defending their eggs against beasts of prey (chiefly hyaenas), or when searching for the male bird. Now they are called rubd, from sing. rubda (instead of rabda&#770;), from the black colour of their long wing-feathers; for only the male, which is called &#1495;&#1497;&#1511; (pronounce he&#770;tsh), has white. The ostrich-tribe has the name of &#1489;&#1468;&#1514; &#1497;&#1506;&#1504;&#1492; bat (Arab. bdt 'l-wa&#8219;nat), 'inhabitant of the desert,' because it is only at home in the most lonely parts of the steppe, in perfectly barren deserts. Neshwn the Himjarite, in his 'Shems el-'olm' (MSS in the Royal Library at Berlin, sectio Wetzst. I No. 149, Bd. i.f. 110b), defines the word el-wa&#8219;na by: &#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1489;&#1497;&#1510;&#1488; &#1500;&#1488; &#1514;&#1504;&#1489;&#1514; &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1488;, a white (chalky or sandy) district, which brings forth nothing; and the Kms explains it by &#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1510;&#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492;, a hard (unfruitful) district. In perfect analogy with the Hebr. the Arabic calls the ostrich abu (and umm) es-saha&#770;ra&#770;, 'possessor of the sterile deserts.' The name &#1497;&#1506;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/4-3.htm">Lamentations 4:3</a>, is perfectly correct, and corresponds to the form &#1497;&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; (steinbocks); the form &#1508;&#1506;&#1500; (Arab. f&#8219;l) is frequently the Nisbe of &#1508;&#1506;&#1500; and &#1508;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492;, according to which &#1497;&#1506;&#1503;  equals  &#1489;&#1468;&#1514; &#1492;&#1497;&#1506;&#1504;&#1492; and &#1497;&#1506;&#1500;  equals  &#1489;&#1468;&#1514; &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492;, 'inhabitant of the inaccessible rocks.' Hence, says Neshwn (against the non-Semite Firzbdi), wa&#8219;l (&#1497;&#1506;&#1500; and wa&#8219;la) is exclusively the high place of the rocks, and wa&#8219;il (&#1497;&#1506;&#1500; exclusively the steinbock. The most common Arabic name of the ostrich is na&#8219;a&#770;me, &#1504;&#1506;&#1502;&#1492;, collective na&#8219;a&#770;m, from the softness (nu&#8219;u&#770;ma, &#1504;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492;) of its feathers, with which the Arab women (in Damascus frequently) stuff cushions and pillows. Umm thela&#770;thin, 'mother of thirty,' is the name of the female ostrich, because as a rule she lays thirty eggs. The ostrich egg is called in the steppe dahwa, &#1491;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1492; (coll. dahu&#770;), a word that is certainly very ancient. Nevertheless the Hauranites prefer the word medha, &#1502;&#1491;&#1495;&#1492;. A place hollowed out in the ground serves as a nest, which the ostrich likes best to dig in the hot sand, on which account they are very common in the sandy tracts of Ard ed-Dehan (&#1491;&#1492;&#1504;&#1488;), between the Shemmar mountains and the Sawd (Chaldaea). Thence at the end of April come the ostrich hunters with their spoil, the hides of the birds together with the feathers, to Syria. Such an unplucked hide is called gizze (&#1490;&#1494;&#1468;&#1492;). The hunters inform us that the female sits alone on the nest from early in the day until evening, and from evening until early in the morning with the male, which wanders about throughout the day. The statement that the ostrich does not sit on its eggs, is perhaps based on the fact that the female frequently, and always before the hunters, forsakes the eggs during the first period of brooding. Even. <a href="/job/39-14.htm">Job 39:14</a> and <a href="/job/39-15.htm">Job 39:15</a> do not say more than this. But when the time of hatching (called el-faqs, &#1508;&#1511;&#1509;) is near, the hen no longer leaves the eggs. The same observation is also made with regard to the partridge of Palestine (el-hagel, &#1495;&#1490;&#1500;), which has many other characteristics in common with the ostrich.<p>That the ostrich is accounted stupid (<a href="/job/39-17.htm">Job 39:17</a>) may arise from the fact, that when the female has been frightened from the eggs she always seeks out the male with a loud cry; she then, as the hunters unanimously assert, brings him forcibly back to the nest (hence its Arabic name zal&#305;&#770;m, 'the violent one'). During the interval the hunter has buried himself in the sand, and on their arrival, by a good shot often kills both together in the nest. It may also be accounted as stupidity, that, when the wind is calm, instead of flying before the riding hunters, the bird tries to hide itself behind a mound or in the hollows of the ground. But that, when escape is impossible, it is said to try to hide its head in the sand, the hunters regard as an absurdity. If the wind aids it, the fleeing ostrich spreads out the feathers of its tail like a sail, and by constantly steering itself with its extended wings, it escapes its pursuers with ease. The word &#1492;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1488;, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/39-18.htm">Job 39:18</a>, appears to be a hunting expression, and (without an accus. objecti) to describe this spreading out of the feathers, therefore to be perfectly synonymous with the &#1514;&#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; (Arab. t'r&#305;&#770;s&#780;) of the ostrich hunters of the present day. Thus sings the poet Rshid of the hunting race of the Sulubt: 'And the head (of the bride with its loosened locks) resembles the (soft and black) feathers of the ostrich-hen, when she spreads them out (&#8219;arrashanna&#770;). They saw the hunter coming upon them where there was no hiding-place, And stretched their legs as they fled.' The prohibition to eat the ostrich in the Thora (<a href="/leviticus/11-16.htm">Leviticus 11:16</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/14-15.htm">Deuteronomy 14:15</a>) is perhaps based upon the cruelty of the hunt; for it is with the rarest exceptions always killed only on its eggs. The female, which, as has been said already, does not flee towards the end of the time of brooding, stoops on the approach of the hunter, inclines the head on one side and looks motionless at her enemy. Several Beduins have said to me, that a man must have a hard heart to fire under such circumstances. If the bird is killed, the hunter covers the blood with sand, puts the female again upon the eggs, buries himself at some distance in the sand, and waits till evening, when the male comes, which is now shot likewise, beside the female. The Mosaic law might accordingly have forbidden the hunting of the ostrich from the same feeling of humanity which unmistakeably regulated it in other decisions (as <a href="/exodus/23-19.htm">Exodus 23:19</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/22-6.htm">Deuteronomy 22:6</a>., <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/22-28.htm">Leviticus 22:28</a>, and freq.).) </body></html>
