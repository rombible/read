In this chapter several animals are spoken of, whose nature or situation particularly show the power, wisdom, and manifold works of God. The wild ass. It is better to labour and be good for something, than to ramble and be good for nothing. From the untameableness of this and other creatures, we may see, how unfit we are to give law to Providence, who cannot give law even to a wild ass's colt. The unicorn, a strong, stately, proud creature. He is able to serve, but not willing; and God challenges Job to force him to it. It is a great mercy if, where God gives strength for service, he gives a heart; it is what we should pray for, and reason ourselves into, which the brutes cannot do. Those gifts are not always the most valuable that make the finest show. Who would not rather have the voice of the nightingale, than the tail of the peacock; the eye of the eagle and her soaring wing, and the natural affection of the stork, than the beautiful feathers of the ostrich, which can never rise above the earth, and is without natural affection? The description of the war-horse helps to explain the character of presumptuous sinners. Every one turneth to his course, as the horse rushes into the battle. When a man's heart is fully set in him to do evil, and he is carried on in a wicked way, by the violence of his appetites and passions, there is no making him fear the wrath of God, and the fatal consequences of sin. Secure sinners think themselves as safe in their sins as the eagle in her nest on high, in the clefts of the rocks; but I will bring thee down from thence, saith the Lord, #Jer 49:16". All these beautiful references to the works of nature, should teach us a right view of the riches of the wisdom of Him who made and sustains all things. The want of right views concerning the wisdom of God, which is ever present in all things, led Job to think and speak unworthily of Providence.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/39.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper? - Or, rather, "as a locust" - &#1499;&#1488;&#1512;&#1489;&#1492;  ka&#772;'arbeh. This is the word which is commonly applied to the locust considered as gregarious, or as appearing in great numbers (from &#1512;&#1489;&#1492;  ra&#770;ba&#770;h, "to be multiplied"). On the variety of the species of locusts, see Bochart "Hieroz." P. ii. Lib. iv. c. 1ff The Hebrew word here rendered "make afraid" (&#1512;&#1506;&#1513;&#1473;  ra&#770;&#8219;ash) means properly "to be moved, to be shaken," and hence, to tremble, to be afraid. In the Hiphil, the form used here, it means to cause to tremble, to shake; and then "to cause to leap," as a horse; and the idea here is, Canst thou cause the horse, an animal so large and powerful, to leap with the agility of a locust? See Gesenius, "Lex." The allusion here is to the leaping or moving of the locusts as they advance in the appearance of squadrons or troops; but the comparison is not so much that of a single horse to a single locust, as of cavalry or a company of war-horses to an army of locusts; and the point of comparison turns on the elasticity or agility of the motion of cavalry advancing to the field of battle.<p>The sense is, that God could cause that rapid and beautiful movement in animals so large and powerful as the horse, but that it was wholly beyond the power of man to effect it. It is quite common in the East to compare a horse with a locust, and travelers have spoken of the remarkable resemblance between the heads of the two. This comparison occurs also in the Bible; see <a href="//biblehub.com/joel/2-4.htm">Joel 2:4</a>, "The appearance of them is as the appearance of horses; and as horsemen so shall they run;" <a href="/revelation/9-7.htm">Revelation 9:7</a>. The Italians, from this resemblance, call the locust "cavaletta," or little horse. Sir W. Ouseley says, "Zakaria Cavini divides the locusts into two classes, like horsemen and footmen, 'mounted and pedestrian.' "Niebuhr says that he heard from a Bedouin near Bassorah, a particular comparison of the locust with other animals; but he thought it a mere fancy of the Arabs, until he heard it repeated at Bagdad. He compared the head of a locust to that of a horse, the breast to that of a lion, the feet to those of a camel, the belly with that of a serpent, the tail with that of a scorpion, and the feelers with the hair of a virgin; see the Pictorial Bible on <a href="/joel/2-4.htm">Joel 2:4</a>.<p>The glory of his nostrils is terrible - Margin, as in Hebrew, "terrors." That is, it is fitted to inspire terror or awe. The reference is to the wide-extended and fiery looking nostrils of the horse when animated, and impatient, for action. So Lucretius, L. v.:<p>Et fremitum patulis sub naribus edit ad arma.<p>So Virgil, "Georg." iii.:87:<p>Collectumque premens voluit sub naribus ignem.<p>Claudian, in iv. "Consulatu Honorii:"<p>Ignescunt patulae nares. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/39.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20. make &#8230; afraid&#8212;rather, "canst thou (as I do) make him spring as the locust?" So in Joe 2:4, the comparison is between locusts and war-horses. The heads of the two are so similar that the Italians call the locusts cavaletta, "little horse."<p>nostrils&#8212;snorting furiously.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/job/39.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">As a grasshopper; </span> which is easily affrighted, and chased away by the least noise of a man.
