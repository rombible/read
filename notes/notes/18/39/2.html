In this chapter several animals are spoken of, whose nature or situation particularly show the power, wisdom, and manifold works of God. The wild ass. It is better to labour and be good for something, than to ramble and be good for nothing. From the untameableness of this and other creatures, we may see, how unfit we are to give law to Providence, who cannot give law even to a wild ass's colt. The unicorn, a strong, stately, proud creature. He is able to serve, but not willing; and God challenges Job to force him to it. It is a great mercy if, where God gives strength for service, he gives a heart; it is what we should pray for, and reason ourselves into, which the brutes cannot do. Those gifts are not always the most valuable that make the finest show. Who would not rather have the voice of the nightingale, than the tail of the peacock; the eye of the eagle and her soaring wing, and the natural affection of the stork, than the beautiful feathers of the ostrich, which can never rise above the earth, and is without natural affection? The description of the war-horse helps to explain the character of presumptuous sinners. Every one turneth to his course, as the horse rushes into the battle. When a man's heart is fully set in him to do evil, and he is carried on in a wicked way, by the violence of his appetites and passions, there is no making him fear the wrath of God, and the fatal consequences of sin. Secure sinners think themselves as safe in their sins as the eagle in her nest on high, in the clefts of the rocks; but I will bring thee down from thence, saith the Lord, #Jer 49:16". All these beautiful references to the works of nature, should teach us a right view of the riches of the wisdom of Him who made and sustains all things. The want of right views concerning the wisdom of God, which is ever present in all things, led Job to think and speak unworthily of Providence.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/39.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Canst thou number the months ... - That is, as they wander in the wilderness, as they live in inaccessible crags and cliffs of the rocks, it is impossible for man to be acquainted with their habits as he can with those of the domestic animals. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/39.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2.

Which some understand both of wild goats and hinds. Common goats fulfil five months, they conceive in November, and bring forth in March, as Pliny (f) observes; but how many the wild goats of the rock fulfil is not said by him or any other I know of: the same writer says (g) of hinds, that they go eight months; <p>or knowest thou the time when they bring forth? naturalists (h) tell us, that the hinds conceive after the rise of the star Arcturus, which rises eleven days before the autumnal equinox; so that they conceive in September; and as they go eight months, they bring forth in April; but then the exact time to a day and hour is not known. Besides, who has fixed the time for their bringing forth, and carries them in it through so many dangers and difficulties? None but the Lord himself. Now if such common things in nature were not known perfectly by Job, how should he be able to search into and find out the causes and reasons of God's providential dealings with men, or what is in the womb of Providence? <p>(f) Nat.

What Jehovah here denies to the natural power of man is possible to the power which man has by faith, as the history of Elijah shows: this, however, does not come under consideration here. In proof of divine omnipotence and human feebleness, Elihu constantly recurs to the rain and the thunder-storm with the lightning, which is at the bidding of God. Most moderns since Schultens therefore endeavour, with great violence, to make &#1496;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; and &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1512;&#1497; mean meteors and celestial phenomena. Eichh. (Hirz., Hahn) compares the Arabic name for the clouds, tacha&#770; (tachwa), Ew. Arab. d&#803;ih&#803;h&#803;, sunshine, with the former; the latter, whose root is &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1492; (&#1505;&#1499;&#1492;), spectare, is meant to be something that is remarkable in the heavens: an atmospheric phenomenon, a meteor (Hirz.), or a phenomenon caused by light (Ew., Hahn), so that e.g., Umbr. translates: "Who hath put wisdom in the dark clouds, and given understanding to the meteor?" But the meaning which is thus extorted from the words in favour of the connection borders closely upon absurdity. Why, then, shall &#1496;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514;, from &#1496;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;, Arab. t&#803;&#305;&#770;ych, oblinere, adipe obducere, not signify here, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/51-8.htm">Psalm 51:8</a>, the reins (embedded in a cushion of fat), and in fact as the seat of the predictive faculty, like &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514;, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/19-27.htm">Job 19:27</a>, as the seat of the innermost longing for the future; and particularly since here, after the constellations and the influences of the stars have just been spoken of, the mention of the gift of divination is not devoid of connection; and, moreover, as a glance at the next strophe shows, the connection which has been hitherto firmly kept to is already in process of being resolved?<p>If &#1496;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; signifies the reins, it is natural to interpret &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1493;&#1497; also psychologically, and to translate the intellect (Targ. I, Syr., Arab.), or similarly (Saad., Gecat.), as Ges., Carey, Renan, Schlottm. But there is another rendering handed down which is worthy of attention, although not once mentioned by Rosenm., Hirz., Schlottm., or Hahn, according to which &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1493;&#1497; signifies a cock, gallum. We read in b. Rosch ha-Schana, 26a: "When I came to Techm-Kn-Nishraja, R. Simeon b. Lakish relates, the bride was there called &#1504;&#1497;&#1504;&#1508;&#1497; and the cock &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1493;&#1497;, according to which <a href="/job/38-36.htm">Job 38:36</a> is to be interpreted: &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1493;&#1497;  equals  &#1514;&#1512;&#1504;&#1490;&#1493;&#1500;." The Midrash interprets in the same way, Jalkut, 905, beginning: "R. Levi says: In Arabic the cock is called &#1505;&#1499;&#1493;&#1488;." We compare with this, Wajikra rabba, c. 1: "&#1505;&#1493;&#1499;&#1493; is Arabic; in Arabia a prophet is called &#1505;&#1499;&#1493;&#1488;;" whence it is to be inferred that &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1493;&#1497;, as is assumed, describes the cock as a seer, as a prophet.<p>As to the formation of the word, it would certainly be without parallel (Ew., Olsh.) if the word had the tone on the penult., but Codd. and the best old editions have the Munach by the final syllable; Norzi, who has overlooked this, at least notes &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1493;&#1497; with the accent on the ult. as a various reading. It is a secondary noun, Ges. 86, 5, a so-called relative noun (De Sacy, Gramm. Arabe, 768): &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1512;&#1497;, speculator, from &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1493; (&#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;, &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1492;), speculatio, as &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;&#1497;, <a href="/judges/13-18.htm">Judges 13:18</a> (comp. <a href="/psalms/139-6.htm">Psalm 139:6</a>), miraculosus, from &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;, a cognate form to the Chald. &#1505;&#1499;&#1493;&#1497; (&#1505;&#1499;&#1493;&#1488;&#1492;), of similar meaning. In connection with this primary signification, speculator, it is intelligible how &#1505;&#1499;&#1493;&#1497; in Samaritan (vid., Lagarde on Proverbs, S. 62) can signify the eye; here, however, in a Hebrew poet, the cock, of which e.g., Gregory says: Speculator semper in altitudine stat, ut quidquid venturum sit longe prospiciat. That this signification speculator  equals  gallus<p>(Note: No Arab. word offers itself here for comparison: tuchaj, a cock, has different consonants, and if Arab. s&#780;ka&#770; in the sense of Arab. s&#780;a&#770;k, fortem esse, were to be supposed, &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1493;&#1497; would be a synon. of &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;, which is likewise a name of the cock.)<p>continued...</body></html>
