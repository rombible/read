Agreeably to this account, the Arabs meet sometimes with whole nests of the eggs undisturbed: some of which are sweet and good; others are addle and corrupted; others, again, have their young ones of different growths, according to the time, it may be presumed, they have been forsaken by the dam.

In this chapter several animals are spoken of, whose nature or situation particularly show the power, wisdom, and manifold works of God. The wild ass. It is better to labour and be good for something, than to ramble and be good for nothing. From the untameableness of this and other creatures, we may see, how unfit we are to give law to Providence, who cannot give law even to a wild ass's colt. The unicorn, a strong, stately, proud creature. He is able to serve, but not willing; and God challenges Job to force him to it. It is a great mercy if, where God gives strength for service, he gives a heart; it is what we should pray for, and reason ourselves into, which the brutes cannot do. Those gifts are not always the most valuable that make the finest show. Who would not rather have the voice of the nightingale, than the tail of the peacock; the eye of the eagle and her soaring wing, and the natural affection of the stork, than the beautiful feathers of the ostrich, which can never rise above the earth, and is without natural affection? The description of the war-horse helps to explain the character of presumptuous sinners. Every one turneth to his course, as the horse rushes into the battle. When a man's heart is fully set in him to do evil, and he is carried on in a wicked way, by the violence of his appetites and passions, there is no making him fear the wrath of God, and the fatal consequences of sin. Secure sinners think themselves as safe in their sins as the eagle in her nest on high, in the clefts of the rocks; but I will bring thee down from thence, saith the Lord, #Jer 49:16". All these beautiful references to the works of nature, should teach us a right view of the riches of the wisdom of Him who made and sustains all things. The want of right views concerning the wisdom of God, which is ever present in all things, led Job to think and speak unworthily of Providence.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/39.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>She is hardened against her young ones - The obvious meaning of this passage, which is a fair translation of the Hebrew, is, that the ostrich is destitute of natural affection for her young; or that she treats them as if she had not the usual natural affection manifested in the animal creation. This sentiment also occurs in <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/4-3.htm">Lamentations 4:3</a>, "The daughter of my people is become cruel, like the ostriches in the wilderness." This opinion is controverted by Buffon, but seems fully sustained by those who have most attentively observed the habits of the ostrich. Dr. Shaw, as quoted by Paxton, and in Robinson's Calmet, says, "On the least noise or trivial occasion she forsakes her eggs or her young ones, to which perhaps she never returns; or if she does, it may be too late either to restore life to the one, or to preserve the lives of the others." "Agreeable to this account," says Paxton, "the Arabs meet sometimes with whole nests of these eggs undisturbed, some of which are sweet and good, and others addle and corrupted; others again have their young ones of different growths, according to the time it may be presumed they have been forsaken by the dam. They oftener meet a few of the little ones, not bigger than well-grown pullets, half-starved, straggling and moaning about like so many distressed orphans for their mothers."<p>Her labour is in vain without fear - Herder renders this," In vain is her travail, but she regards it not." The idea in the passage seems to be this; that the ostrich has not that apprehension or provident care for her young which others birds have. It does not mean that she is an animal remarkably bold and courageous, for the contrary is the fact, and she is, according to the Arabian writers, timid to a proverb; but that she has none of the anxious solicitude for her young which others seem to have - the dread that they may be in want, or in danger, which leads them, often at the peril of their own lives, to provide for and defend them. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/job/39.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16.

It is also said that she lays a number of eggs outside the nest, which are not incubated but serve as food for the poults when they are hatched.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/39.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">She is hardened against her young ones, as though they were not hers.</span> This is a deduction from what has preceded, and discloses no new fact. Recent careful observation of the habits of the ostrich indicates that the parental instinct is not wanting, though it may be weaker than in most birds. Both the male and the female incubate at night, and, when the nest is approached by the hunter, the parent bird or birds will leave it, and try to draw him away from it by running on in front of him, or feigning to attack him, much as peewits do in our own country. <span class="cmt_word">Her labour is in vain without fear</span>; or, <span class="accented">though her labour is in vain</span>, <span class="accented">she is without fear</span> (see the Revised Version); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> though she is often disappointed of her immediate hope of offspring, through her eggs being crushed and destroyed, yet she grows no wiser, she does not fear for the future. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/job/39.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>  9  Will the oryx be willing to serve thee,<p>Or will he lodge in thy crib?<p>10  Canst thou bind the oryx in the furrow with a leading rein,<p>Or will he harrow the valleys, following thee?<p>11  Wilt thou trust him because his strength is great,<p>And leave thy labour to him?<p>12  Wilt thou confide in him to bring in thy sowing,<p>And to garner thy threshing-floor?<p>In correct texts &#1512;&#1497;&#1501; has a Dagesh in the Resh, and &#1492;&#1497;&#1488;&#1489;&#1492; the accent on the penult., as <a href="/proverbs/11-21.htm">Proverbs 11:21</a> &#1497;&#1504;&#1468;&#1511;&#1492; &#1512;&#1506;, and <a href="/jeremiah/39-12.htm">Jeremiah 39:12</a> &#1512;&#1468;&#1506; &#1502;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492;.

Regularly, the second word is not dageshed if it begins with &#1493;, &#1499;, &#1500;, &#1489;, or if the first word is only a bare verb, e.g., &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1500;&#1493;, or one that has only &#1493; before it, e.g., &#1493;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1508;&#1505;&#1495;; the tone of the first word in both these examples retreats, but without the initial of the second being doubled.
