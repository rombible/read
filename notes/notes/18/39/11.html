In this chapter several animals are spoken of, whose nature or situation particularly show the power, wisdom, and manifold works of God. The wild ass. It is better to labour and be good for something, than to ramble and be good for nothing. From the untameableness of this and other creatures, we may see, how unfit we are to give law to Providence, who cannot give law even to a wild ass's colt. The unicorn, a strong, stately, proud creature. He is able to serve, but not willing; and God challenges Job to force him to it. It is a great mercy if, where God gives strength for service, he gives a heart; it is what we should pray for, and reason ourselves into, which the brutes cannot do. Those gifts are not always the most valuable that make the finest show. Who would not rather have the voice of the nightingale, than the tail of the peacock; the eye of the eagle and her soaring wing, and the natural affection of the stork, than the beautiful feathers of the ostrich, which can never rise above the earth, and is without natural affection? The description of the war-horse helps to explain the character of presumptuous sinners. Every one turneth to his course, as the horse rushes into the battle. When a man's heart is fully set in him to do evil, and he is carried on in a wicked way, by the violence of his appetites and passions, there is no making him fear the wrath of God, and the fatal consequences of sin. Secure sinners think themselves as safe in their sins as the eagle in her nest on high, in the clefts of the rocks; but I will bring thee down from thence, saith the Lord, #Jer 49:16". All these beautiful references to the works of nature, should teach us a right view of the riches of the wisdom of Him who made and sustains all things. The want of right views concerning the wisdom of God, which is ever present in all things, led Job to think and speak unworthily of Providence.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/job/39.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Wilt thou trust him? - As thou dost the ox. In the domestic animals great confidence is of necessity placed, and the reliance on the fidelity of the ox and the horse is not usually misplaced.

The strength of the ox, the camel, the horse, and the elephant was a reason why their aid was sought by man to do what he could not himself do.

It is entirely distinct from the mah or baqar el-wahsh, wild ox, whose large soft eyes are so much celebrated by the poets of the steppe. This latter is horned and double-hoofed, and forms the transition from the stag to the ox distinct from the ri'm, &#1512;&#1488;&#1501;, therefore perhaps an antelope of the kind of the Indian nlgau, blue ox, Portax tragocamelus. I have not seen both kinds of animals alive, but I have often seen their skins in the tents of the Ruwal. Both kinds are remarkable for their very swift running, and it is especially affirmed of the fer that no rider can overtake it. The poets compare a troop of horsemen that come rushing up and vanish in the next moment to a herd of fer. In spite of its difficulty and hazardousness, the nomads are passionately given to hunting the wild ass, and the proverb cited by the Kms: kull es-se&#770;d bigo&#770;f el-fera&#770; (every hunt sticks in the belly of the fer, i.e., compared with that, every other hunt is nothing), is perfectly correct. When the approach of a herd, which always consists of several hundred, is betrayed by a cloud of dust which can be seen many miles off, so many horsemen rise up from all sides in pursuit that the animals are usually scattered, and single ones are obtained by the dogs and by shots. The herd is called gem&#305;&#770;le, and its leader is called &#8219;anu&#770;d (&#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;),as with gazelles. - Wetzst.)<p>In Hebr. and Arab. it is &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488; (fera&#770; or hima&#770;r el-wahsh, i.e., asinus ferus), and Aram. &#1506;&#1512;&#1493;&#1491;; the former describes it as a swift-footed animal, the latter as an animal shy and difficult to be tamed by the hand of man; "Kulan" is its Eastern Asiatic name. lxx correctly translates: &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c2; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;. &#1495;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; is the acc. of the predicate (comp. <a href="/genesis/33-2.htm">Genesis 33:2</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/22-30.htm">Jeremiah 22:30</a>). Parallel with &#1506;&#1512;&#1489;&#1492; (according to its etymon perhaps, land of darkness, terra incognita) is &#1502;&#1500;&#1495;&#1492;, salt adj. or (sc. &#1488;&#1512;&#1509;) a salt land, i.e., therefore unfruitful and incapable of culture, as the country round the Salt Sea of Palestine: that the wild ass even gladly licks the salt or natron of the desert, is a matter of fact, and may be assumed, since all wild animals that feed on plants have a partiality, which is based on chemical laws of life, for licking slat. On <a href="/job/39-8.htm">Job 39:8</a> Ew. observes, to render &#1497;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; as "what is espied" is insecure, "on account of the structure of the verse" (Gramm. S. 419, Anm.). This reason is unintelligible; and in general there is no reason for rendering &#1497;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, after lxx, Targ., Jer., and others, as an Aramaic 3 fut. with a mere half vowel instead of Kametz before the tone  equals  &#1497;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, which is without example in Old Testament Hebrew (for &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;, <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/11-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 11:3</a>, follows the analogy of &#1497;&#1492;&#1497;), but &#1497;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; signifies either abundantia (after the form &#1497;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;, &#1500;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/20-23.htm">Job 20:23</a>, from &#1497;&#1514;&#1512;, Arab. wtr, p. 571) or investigabile, what can be searched out (after the form &#1497;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;, that which exists, from &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, Arab. ta&#770;r, to go about, look about), which, with Olsh. 212, and most expositors, we prefer. </body></html>
