<span class="ital">as in all the churches of the saints, let your women keep silence in the churches, </span>namely, of Achaia. According to this reading, by <span class="ital">the churches of the saints, </span>are meant the churches of Judea, in which the public worship and discipline was most perfect, because they had been planted and regulated by the apostles. The sense of this clause, <span class="ital">let your women keep silence, </span>&c, evidently is, that they were to be silent unless they had an extraordinary revelation to communicate, made to them by the Holy Spirit; to which revelations, chiefly predicting future events, what is said of their prophesying with their heads uncovered, (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-5.htm" title="But every woman that prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head: for that is even all one as if she were shaven.">1 Corinthians 11:5</a>,) evidently refers; and therefore implies no contradiction to what is here enjoined. <span class="ital">For </span>— In other cases, when no particular revelation is made to them; <span class="ital">it is not permitted unto them to speak </span>— By way of teaching in public assemblies; <span class="ital">but to be under obedience </span>— Greek, <span class="greekheb">υποτασσεσθαι</span>, <span class="ital">to be under subjection </span>to the superior authority of the man, whose proper office it is to lead and to instruct the congregation. <span class="ital">As also saith the law </span>— In recording that early sentence on Eve and her daughters for the first transgression, <a href="/genesis/3-16.htm" title="To the woman he said, I will greatly multiply your sorrow and your conception; in sorrow you shall bring forth children; and your desire shall be to your husband, and he shall rule over you.">Genesis 3:16</a>, <span class="ital">To him shall be thy desire </span>subjected, <span class="ital">and he shall rule over thee.

The Spirit of Christ can never contradict itself; and if their revelations are against those of the apostle, they do not come from the same Spirit. The way to keep peace, truth, and order in the church, is to seek that which is good for it, to bear with that which is not hurtful to its welfare, and to keep up good behaviour, order, and decency.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Let your women keep silence ... - This rule is positive, explicit, and universal. There is no ambiguity in the expressions; and there can be no difference of opinion, one would suppose, in regard to their meaning. The sense evidently is, that in all those things which he had specified, the women were to keep silence; they were to take no part. He had discoursed of speaking foreign languages, and of prophecy; and the evident sense is, that in regard to all these they were to keep silence, or were not to engage in them. These pertained solely to the male portion of the congregation. These things constituted the business of the public teaching; and in this the female part of the congregation were to be silent. "They were not to teach the people, nor were they to interrupt those who were speaking" - Rosenmuller. It is probable that, on pretence of being inspired, the women had assumed the office of public teachers.<p>In <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11.htm">1 Corinthians 11</a>, Paul had argued against their doing this in a certain manner - without their veils <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-4.htm">1 Corinthians 11:4</a>, and he had shown, that "on that account," and "in that manner," it was improper for them to assume the office of public teachers, and to conduct the devotions of the church. The force of the argument in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11.htm">1 Corinthians 11</a>:is, that what he there states would be a sufficient reason against the practice, even if there were no other. It was contrary to all decency and propriety that they should appear "in that manner" in public. He here argues against the practice on every ground; forbids it altogether; and shows that on every consideration it was to be regarded as improper for them even so much as "to ask a question" in time of public service. There is, therefore, no inconsistency between the argument in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11.htm">1 Corinthians 11</a>:and the statement here; and the force of the whole is, that "on every consideration" it was improper, and to be expressly prohibited, for women to conduct the devotions of the church. It does not refer to those only who claimed to be inspired, but to all; it does not refer merely to acts of public preaching, but to all acts of speaking, or even asking questions, when the church is assembled for public worship. No rule in the New Testament is more positive than this; and however plausible may be the reasons which may be urged for disregarding it, and for suffering women to take part in conducting public worship, yet the authority of the apostle Paul is positive, and his meaning cannot be mistaken; compare <a href="//biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-11.htm">1 Timothy 2:11-12</a>.<p>To be under obedience - To be subject to their husbands; to acknowledge the superior authority of the man; see the note at <a href="/1_corinthians/11-3.htm">1 Corinthians 11:3</a>.<p>As also saith the law - <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/3-16.htm">Genesis 3:16</a>, "And thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>34. (1Ti 2:11, 12). For women to speak in public would be an act of independence, as if they were not subject to their husbands (compare 1Co 11:3; Eph 5:22; Tit 2:5; 1Pe 3:1). For "under obedience," translate, "in subjection" or "submission," as the Greek is translated (Eph 5:21, 22, 24).<p>the law&#8212;a term applied to the whole Old Testament; here, Ge 3:16.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_corinthians/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This rule must be restrained to ordinary prophesyings; for certainly, if the Spirit of prophecy came upon a woman in the church, she might speak.

The reason that is given why women should <span class="ital">keep silence, </span> is, because <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">they are commanded to be under obedience.</span> This apostle speaketh much the same thing, <span class="bld"><a href="/1_timothy/2-11.htm" title="Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.">1 Timothy 2:11</a>,12</span>, because it looked like a usurping authority over the man; which indeed is true, if it had been the ordinary practice of women to speak in the assemblies of the church; but not so, if some particular women sometimes spake upon an extraordinary impulse or impression. The law to which the apostle here refers, is thought to be that, <span class="bld"><a href="/genesis/3-16.htm" title="To the woman he said, I will greatly multiply your sorrow and your conception; in sorrow you shall bring forth children; and your desire shall be to your husband, and he shall rule over you.">Genesis 3:16</a></span>, where the woman is commanded to be subject to her husband, and it is said, that he should rule over her; yet that law did neither restrain Miriam from prophesying, <span class="bld"><a href="/exodus/15-20.htm" title="And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a tambourine in her hand; and all the women went out after her with tambourines and with dances.">Exodus 15:20</a></span>, nor yet Huldah, to whom Josiah himself sent, <span class="bld"><a href="/2_chronicles/34-22.htm" title="And Hilkiah, and they that the king had appointed, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelled in Jerusalem in the college:) and they spoke to her to that effect.">2 Chronicles 34:22</a></span>, of whom it is also said, that <span class="ital">she dwelt in the college.</span> But setting aside that extraordinary case of a special afflatus, it was, doubtless, unlawful for a woman to speak in the church. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_corinthians/14.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Let your women keep silence in the churches,.... This is a restriction of, and an exception to one of the above rules, that all might prophesy; in which he would be understood of men only, and not of women; and is directed against a practice which seems to have prevailed in this church at Corinth, allowing women to preach and teach in it; and this being a disorderly practice, and what was not used in other churches, the apostle forbids and condemns, and not without reason: <p>for it is not permitted unto them to speak; that is, in public assemblies, in the church of God, they might not speak with tongues, nor prophesy, or preach, or teach the word. All speaking is not prohibited; they might speak their experiences to the church, or give an account of the work of God upon their souls; they might speak to one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs; or speak as an evidence in any case at a church meeting; but not in such sort, as carried in it direction, instruction, government, and authority. It was not allowed by God that they should speak in any authoritative manner in the church; nor was it suffered in the churches of Christ; nor was it admitted of in the Jewish synagogue; there, we are told (b), the men came to teach, and the women  "to hear": and one of their canons runs thus (c); <p>"a woman may not read (that is, in the law),  "in the congregation", or church, because of the honour of the congregation;'' <p>for they thought it a dishonourable thing to a public assembly for a woman to read, though they even allowed a child to do it that was capable of it. <p>But they are commanded to be under obedience, as also saith the law. In <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/3-16.htm">Genesis 3:16</a>, "thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee". By this the apostle would signify, that the reason why women are not to speak in the church, or to preach and teach publicly, or be concerned in the ministerial function, is, because this is an act of power, and authority; of rule and government, and so contrary to that subjection which God in his law requires of women unto men. The extraordinary instances of Deborah, Huldah, and Anna, must not be drawn into a rule or example in such cases. <p>(b) T. Hieros Chagiga, fol. 75. 4. &amp; T. Bab. Chagiga, fol. 3. 1. (c) Maimon.
