Tongues should not be exalted in estimation above prophecy—inasmuch as the function of the latter is really grander than that of the former.

A truly Christian minister will seek much more to do spiritual good to men's souls, than to get the greatest applause to himself. This is proving himself the servant of Christ. Children are apt to be struck with novelty; but do not act like them. Christians should be like children, void of guile and malice; yet they should not be unskilful as to the word of righteousness, but only as to the arts of mischief. It is a proof that a people are forsaken of God, when he gives them up to the rule of those who teach them to worship in another language. They can never be benefitted by such teaching. Yet thus the preachers did who delivered their instructions in an unknown tongue. Would it not make Christianity ridiculous to a heathen, to hear the ministers pray or preach in a language which neither he nor the assembly understood? But if those who minister, plainly interpret Scripture, or preach the great truths and rules of the gospel, a heathen or unlearned person might become a convert to Christianity. His conscience might be touched, the secrets of his heart might be revealed to him, and so he might be brought to confess his guilt, and to own that God was present in the assembly. Scripture truth, plainly and duly taught, has a wonderful power to awaken the conscience and touch the heart.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Wherefore - Thus, (&#x3a9;&#788;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;  Ho&#772;ste), or wherefore. The apostle does not mean to say that what he was about to state was a direct conclusion from the passage of Scripture which he had quoted, but that it followed from all that he had said, and from the whole view of the subject. "The true statement or doctrine is, that tongues are for a sign," etc.<p>Tongues - The power of speaking foreign languages.<p>Are for a sign - An "indication," an evidence, or a proof that God has imparted this power, and that he attends the preaching of the gospel with his approbation.

God alone could confer the power of thus speaking; and as it was conferred expressly to aid in the propagation of the gospel, it proved that it was from God; see the note on <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/2-1.htm">Acts 2:1-15</a>.<p>But prophesying - Speaking in a calm, connected, didactic manner, in language intelligible to all under the influence of inspiration; see notes on <a href="/1_corinthians/14-1.htm">1 Corinthians 14:1</a>.<p>For them that believe not - Is not particularly intended for them; but is intended mainly for the edifying of the church. It is not so striking, so replete with proofs of the divine presence and power as the gift of tongues. Though it may be really under the influence of the Holy Spirit, and may be really by inspiration, yet it is not so evidently such as is the power of speaking foreign languages. It was, therefore, better adapted to edify the church than to convince gainsayers. At the same time the "truths" conveyed by it, and the consolations administered by it, might be as clear evidence to the church of the attending power, and presence, and goodness of God, as the power of speaking foreign languages might be to infidels. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22. Thus from Isaiah it appears, reasons Paul, that "tongues" (unknown and uninterpreted) are not a sign mainly intended for believers (though at the conversion of Cornelius and the Gentiles with him, tongues were vouchsafed to him and them to confirm their faith), but mainly to be a condemnation to those, the majority, who, like Israel in Isaiah's day, reject the sign and the accompanying message. Compare "yet &#8230; will they not hear Me" (1Co 14:21). "Sign" is often used for a condemnatory sign (Eze 4:3, 4; Mt 12:39-42). Since they will not understand, they shall not understand.<p>prophesying &#8230; not for them that believe not, but &#8230; believe&#8212;that is, prophesying has no effect on them that are radically and obstinately like Israel (Isa 28:11, 12), unbelievers, but on them that are either in receptivity or in fact believers; it makes believers of those not wilfully unbelievers (1Co 14:24, 25; Ro 10:17), and spiritually nourishes those that already believe.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_corinthians/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Wherefore tongues are for a sign, &c.; </span> that is, an eminent product of Divine providence for the confirmation of the truth of the doctrine of the gospel; signifying that the doctrine which was so delivered in every nation’s language, must be from heaven, from whence the first ministers must have their power so to speak; yet, doubtless, they were not only for a sign, being also a means, by which the knowledge of the gospel was conveyed unto those who could not have understood what the apostles and first ministers of the gospel said, had they not spoken to them in the language of the hearers. When he saith, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">prophesying serveth not for them that believe not, </span> the meaning is, not only for them that believe not; for prophesying is certainly of use to them that believe not, for their conversion, as well as <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">for them that believe, </span> for their edification. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_corinthians/14.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Wherefore tongues are for a sign,.... Of wrath and punishment inflicted on a rebellious and unbelieving people, and not of grace and kindness, as prophesying, or speaking to them by the prophets, was; and so this is an inference from what is said in the preceding verse, and shows, that there was no reason why believers should be so very desirous of them. But if these words refer to all that is said before on this subject, the word "sign" may be taken for a miracle; and so a new argument is formed against an over fondness for divers tongues, and the use of them in public worship, showing the preferableness of prophecy to them; for speaking with divers tongues was used in a miraculous way, <p>not to them that believe; who have no need of miracles to raise their attention to what is said, and that it may gain credit with them, or to confirm their faith in it: <p>but to them that believe not; to prepare them to listen to what might be suggested to them, when they see the persons speaking were endued with miraculous powers, and to engage their assent to it, and belief of it; and so with such persons, and for such purposes, was the gift of speaking with divers tongues used by the apostles, <a href="/acts/2-4.htm">Acts 2:4</a> but inasmuch as the Corinthian church consisted of believers, there was no need of such a sign or miracle among them; wherefore, if they desired such gifts, and to make use of them, they should choose to do it, not in the church, but among unbelievers: <p>but prophesying serveth not for them that believe not; that is, not for them only; for prophesying or explaining the prophetic writings, or preaching the word, may be, and often is, the means of converting unbelievers; yet this is not the only use, nor does it serve for, or administer comfort to unbelievers as such; but is profitable to, and serves <p>for them which believe: it is for their edification, exhortation, and comfort, <a href="/1_corinthians/14-4.htm">1 Corinthians 14:4</a> it is the means of building them up on their most holy faith; of quickening and stirring them up to the exercise of grace, and performance of duty; of comforting them under various distresses, inward and outward; and of establishing, strengthening, and settling them, and therefore much more eligible to be used in a church of Christ, than speaking with tongues. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_corinthians/14.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{10}</span> Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not: but prophesying <i>serveth</i> not for them that believe not, but for them which believe.</span><p>(10) The conclusion: therefore the gift of tongues serves to punish the unfaithful and unbelievers, unless it is referred to prophecy (that is to say, to the interpretation of scripture) and that what is spoken is by the means of prophecy is understood by the hearers.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/1_corinthians/14.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/1_corinthians/14-22.htm" title="Why tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not: but prophesying serves not for them that believe not, but for them which believe.">1 Corinthians 14:22</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ὥστε</span>] <span class="ital">Accordingly</span>, namely, in accordance with this <span class="greekheb">οὐδʼ οὕτως εἰσακούσ</span>. <span class="greekheb">μου</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">εἰς σημεῖον κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.] The phenomenon of the speaking with tongues is <span class="ital">destined for a</span> (divine) <span class="ital">sign, not for the believers, but for the unbelievers</span>, i.e. <span class="ital">to make those to whom the glossolalia goes forth be recognised as unbelievers</span>.

Equally unsuitable is it that Chrysostom, Theophylact, and others, including Hofmann, only half carry out this traditional interpretation, and stop short at the <span class="ital">impression of something astounding and amazing</span>, whereby the <span class="greekheb">γλῶσσαι</span> are to be a <span class="greekheb">σημεῖον</span> to the unbelievers, which, moreover, in presence of the notion of a divine <span class="greekheb">σημεῖον</span>, could only appear as a means to an ulterior end.

Billroth, moreover (comp. Beza, Vatablus, Calovius, Cornelius a Lapide, and others), is in error in holding that <span class="greekheb">σημεῖον</span> is a <span class="ital">penal sign</span>, or a sign of <span class="ital">divine judgment</span>; comp. also Hilgenfeld, p. 21; Rossteuscher, p. 77. This, in fact, is not at all implied in <a href="/1_corinthians/14-21.htm" title="In the law it is written, With men of other tongues and other lips will I speak to this people; and yet for all that will they not hear me, said the LORD.">1 Corinthians 14:21</a>, where, on the contrary, the glossolalia appears as a last extraordinary measure remaining likewise <span class="ital">without result</span>, which will at length make full exposure of the disobedience of the persons in question, but not as a sign of wrath. And had Paul thought of <span class="ital">irae signum</span>, he must have expressed the <span class="ital">irae</span> too, and, in fact, brought it emphatically forward.[13] Again Storr, Flatt, Baur, and Dav. Schulz (<span class="ital">Geistesg</span>. pp. 78, 176) are wrong in saying that the <span class="ital">prevalence of the glossolalia</span> in the church <span class="ital">was a sign of their unbelief</span>. This is unsuitable for this reason, that according to <a href="/1_corinthians/14-21.htm" title="In the law it is written, With men of other tongues and other lips will I speak to this people; and yet for all that will they not hear me, said the LORD.">1 Corinthians 14:21</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/14-23.htm" title="If therefore the whole church be come together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in those that are unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not say that you are mad?">1 Corinthians 14:23</a> we are to conceive as the <span class="greekheb">ἄπιστοι</span> not those who <span class="ital">speak</span> <span class="greekheb">γλώσσαις</span>, but those who <span class="ital">are spoken to</span> in <span class="greekheb">γλ</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τοῖς ἀπίστοις</span>] Dative of the reference in view, as is also <span class="greekheb">τοῖς πιστεύουσιν</span>. The conception of the <span class="greekheb">ἄπιστοι</span>, however, is, by virtue of this very antithesis (and see also <a href="/context/1_corinthians/14-23.htm" title="If therefore the whole church be come together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in those that are unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not say that you are mad?...">1 Corinthians 14:23-24</a>), simply <span class="ital">the non-believing</span>, the <span class="ital">unbelievers</span>,—a conception which is neither to be softened down to that of <span class="ital">non-genuine Christians</span> or the like (Flatt, David Schulz), nor intensified to that of <span class="ital">obstinate</span> unbelievers, those wholly <span class="ital">unsusceptible</span> of faith, infideles <span class="ital">privative</span> (Neander, Billroth, Rückert). Hirzel in the <span class="ital">Stud. u. Krit.</span> 1840, p. 120 ff. (who is followed in substance by de Wette, Osiander, Maier, Engelmann, and see Bengel’s hints of earlier date), understands by the <span class="greekheb">ἀπίστοις</span> those <span class="ital">who do not wish to believe</span>, and by the <span class="greekheb">πιστεύουσιν</span> those <span class="ital">who wish to believe</span>.[14] Comp. de Wette: “They are not heard by such <span class="ital">as let themselves be moved thereby to believe</span>, but by such <span class="ital">as remain unbelieving</span>.” This is conclusively negatived by the prevailing use of <span class="greekheb">οἱ πιστεύοντες</span> and <span class="greekheb">οἱ ἄπιστοι</span>, to which any such artificial pregnancy of meaning is quite alien (see immediately, <a href="/context/1_corinthians/14-23.htm" title="If therefore the whole church be come together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in those that are unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not say that you are mad?...">1 Corinthians 14:23-24</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἡ δὲ προφητεία κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.] a contrast, which is not intended to be inferred from that passage of Scripture,—which in truth says nothing whatever about the <span class="greekheb">προφητεύειν</span>,—but the truth of which was self-evident to the readers in virtue of an <span class="ital">argumentum e contrario</span>. We are not, however, to <span class="ital">supply</span> the simple <span class="greekheb">ἐστί</span>, so that the meaning would be: not to the unbelievers, but to the believers, is the prophetic address to be directed (my own view hitherto), but rather <span class="greekheb">εἰς σημεῖόν ἐστιν</span>, for Paul has not written <span class="greekheb">ἐστιν</span> at all, and therefore leaves the predicate of the first half of the verse to operate still in virtue of the antithesis. Consequently: <span class="ital">prophecy is designed to be a sign not for the unbelievers, but for the believers</span>, i.e. <span class="ital">in order to make those to whom the prophetic address is directed known as believers</span>; see <a href="/1_corinthians/14-24.htm" title="But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believes not, or one unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all:">1 Corinthians 14:24</a>, where this statement of the apostle is verified by the fact that such as come into the Christian assembly as unbelievers, being won over by the overpowering impression of the prophetic addresses, submit themselves to Christianity and declare themselves believers. Erasmus, Grotius, and Bleek are wrong in holding that <span class="greekheb">οὐ</span> means <span class="ital">non tantum</span>. The negation is absolute, as in the preceding clause. Comp. Fritzsche, <span class="ital">ad Matth.</span> p. 784. According to Hirzel (de Wette and Osiander), the meaning here also is alleged to be: prophecy is given not for such as do not <span class="ital">wish</span> to believe, but for such as <span class="ital">wish</span> to believe.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[13] According to Billroth’s view, namely, Paul warns the Corinthians that they should not thoughtlessly foster among themselves a thing which is called in the O. T. a <span class="ital">sign of punishment</span>. Comp. Beza and Cornelius a Lapide, also Calovius. Upon this view, Paul must have absolutely <span class="ital">disapproved of</span> the glossolalia. It would have been a tempting of God by the abuse of a divine sign of curse.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[14] Hofmann also understands by <span class="greekheb">τοῖς ἀπίστοις</span> <span class="ital">those indisposed to believe</span>. As if Paul would not have known how to express this conception! Hofmann even conceives two classes to be comprehended under <span class="greekheb">τοῖς πιστεύουσιν</span>, namely, those already <span class="ital">standing</span> in faith and those who are <span class="ital">becoming</span> believers, and holds that on this account Paul did not write <span class="greekheb">τοῖς πιστοῖς</span>.

The latter is more probable, and in that case it becomes not an argument, but an illustration. The occupation of Judæa by the Assyrian and Babylonian troops had been a sign to God’s people of their unbelief and its punishment, and the unwonted speech they had been doomed to hear was to them a call to repentance, especially when viewed in the light of the prophecy of Moses in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-49.htm" title="The LORD shall bring a nation against you from far, from the end of the earth, as swift as the eagle flies; a nation whose tongue you shall not understand;">Deuteronomy 28:49</a>. In a similar manner the miraculous gift of tongues was still (see next verse), as at the Day of Pentecost, a call to the outside world to examine and inquire into this new thing which had come to pass, to acknowledge in it the finger of God, and to “repent and be baptized for the remission of sins.” Cf. <a href="/context/acts/2-7.htm" title="And they were all amazed and marveled, saying one to another, Behold, are not all these which speak Galilaeans?...">Acts 2:7-12</a>; <a href="/acts/2-41.htm" title="Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added to them about three thousand souls.">Acts 2:41</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/1_corinthians/14.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/1_corinthians/14-22.htm" title="Why tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not: but prophesying serves not for them that believe not, but for them which believe.">1 Corinthians 14:22</a>. <span class="greekheb">Εἰς σημεῖον</span>) <span class="ital">for a sign</span>, by which unbelievers may be allured and <span class="ital">hear</span> [<span class="ital">give ear to</span>] the word; but <span class="greekheb">οὐδʼ οὕτως</span>, <span class="ital">not even thus</span> do they hear [alluding to <a href="/isaiah/28-12.htm" title="To whom he said, This is the rest with which you may cause the weary to rest; and this is the refreshing: yet they would not hear.">Isaiah 28:12</a>, see last note].—<span class="greekheb">εἰσὶν</span>, <span class="ital">have their existence</span>) The accent has the effect of making the word emphatic.—<span class="greekheb">ἡ δὲ προφητεία</span>, <span class="ital">but prophecy</span>) namely, <span class="ital">is for a sign</span>, or simply <span class="ital">is;</span> comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/6-3.htm" title="Know you not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life?">1 Corinthians 6:3</a>.—<span class="greekheb">τοῖς πιστεύουσιν</span>, <span class="ital">to them that believe</span>) This must be taken as an instance of the figure Amplificatio;[126] inasmuch as prophecy makes believers of unbelievers; the speaking tongue leaves the unbeliever to himself [still an unbeliever]. The expression of Paul is indefinite. Unbelievers, generally, when tongues fall upon them, continue to be unbelievers, but prophecy makes believers of unbelievers, and gives spiritual nourishment to them, that believe.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[126] See Append.
