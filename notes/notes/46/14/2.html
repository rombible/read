This is not the place to enter into the question of what particular external manifestation of this gift was evidenced on the Day of Pentecost. (See <a href="/context/acts/2-1.htm" title="And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place.">Acts 2:1-13</a>.) Still, believing that the gift of tongues here spoken of is identical with the gift of tongues which was first bestowed at Pentecost, I would say that the phenomena described as occurring then must be explained by the fuller and more elaborate account of the nature of the gift which is given to us here. Against the theory that the gift was one of a capacity to speak various languages we have three considerations. (1) The word <span class= "ital">dialectos,</span> which is repeatedly used to express languages (<a href="/acts/1-19.htm" title="And it was known to all the dwellers at Jerusalem; so as that field is called in their proper tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood.">Acts 1:19</a>; <a href="/acts/2-6.htm" title="Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because that every man heard them speak in his own language.">Acts 2:6</a>; <a href="/acts/2-8.htm" title="And how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born?">Acts 2:8</a>; <a href="/acts/21-40.htm" title="And when he had given him license, Paul stood on the stairs, and beckoned with the hand to the people. And when there was made a great silence, he spoke to them in the Hebrew tongue, saying,">Acts 21:40</a>; <a href="/acts/22-2.htm" title="(And when they heard that he spoke in the Hebrew tongue to them, they kept the more silence: and he said,)">Acts 22:2</a>; <a href="/acts/26-14.htm" title="And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking to me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecute you me? it is hard for you to kick against the pricks.">Acts 26:14</a>), is never used by St. Paul or by the author of the Acts in reference to the utterances of those who possessed the gift of tongues, but the other word, <span class= "ital">glossa,</span> which is, literally, the physical organ of speech—as if the utterances were simply sounds that proceeded from it. (2) There is no trace whatever of this knowledge of languages having been ever used for the purpose of preaching to those who spoke foreign languages. The language of the Lycaonians was evidently not understood by the Apostles when they were addressed in it (see <a href="/acts/14-11.htm" title="And when the people saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men.">Acts 14:11</a>), and they did not speak in it. That the hearers at Pentecost said they heard those who were filled with the Spirit “speak in our own language” would only imply, either that the outpouring on Pentecost had for the moment a miraculous effect, which immediately ceased, or that “all the various elements of Aramaic and Hellenistic speech, latent in the usual language of the time, were quickened, under the power of this gift, into a new life, sometimes intelligible, sometimes unintelligible to those who heard it, but always expressive of the vitality and energy of the Spirit by which it was animated.” (3) The description of the gift in this chapter is utterly inconsistent with it being a gift of languages. The gift was the result of a quickened spiritual power by the action of the Holy Ghost (see also <a href="/acts/2-4.htm" title="And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.">Acts 2:4</a>; <a href="/context/acts/10-44.htm" title="While Peter yet spoke these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word.">Acts 10:44-46</a>; <a href="/acts/19-6.htm" title="And when Paul had laid his hands on them, the Holy Ghost came on them; and they spoke with tongues, and prophesied.">Acts 19:6</a>); it poured itself forth in wild, impassioned utterances, which were sometimes mistaken for delirium (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-23.htm" title="If therefore the whole church be come together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in those that are unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not say that you are mad?">1Corinthians 14:23</a>); and these were the expressions, not of thoughts, but of feelings, unintelligible always, if uninterpreted, to the listener, and sometimes to the utterer himself.<p>It is to be observed that very notable spiritual phenomena, not unlike what are recorded here, accompanied many periods of great spiritual revival. The histories of the early work of Wesley and Whitfield, and of Irving—to take examples in England alone—afford some very remarkable illustrations. The general subject of the first part of this chapter (<a href="/context/1_corinthians/14-1.htm" title="Follow after charity, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather that you may prophesy.">1Corinthians 14:1-25</a>) is the Gift of Tongues, and is thus dealt with:—<p>I.PROPHECY IS SUPERIOR TO THE GIFT OF TONGUES (<a href="/context/1_corinthians/14-2.htm" title="For he that speaks in an unknown tongue speaks not to men, but to God: for no man understands him; however, in the spirit he speaks mysteries.">1Corinthians 14:2-11</a>)<p>Because (1)Tongues are the means of communion between the individual and God, whereas prophecy is communion with other men (<a href="/context/1_corinthians/14-2.htm" title="For he that speaks in an unknown tongue speaks not to men, but to God: for no man understands him; however, in the spirit he speaks mysteries.">1Corinthians 14:2-3</a>).<p>(2)Tongues do yourself good; prophecy does good to others (<a href="/context/1_corinthians/14-4.htm" title="He that speaks in an unknown tongue edifies himself; but he that prophesies edifies the church.">1Corinthians 14:4-6</a>).<p>This truth is illustrated (<span class= "ital">a</span>) by the variety of musical instruments (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-7.htm" title="And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped?">1Corinthians 14:7</a>); (<span class= "ital">b</span>) by the distinction of musical notes (<a href="/context/1_corinthians/14-8.htm" title="For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle?">1Corinthians 14:8-9</a>); (<span class= "ital">c</span>) by the varieties of human language (<a href="/context/1_corinthians/14-10.htm" title="There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and none of them is without signification.">1Corinthians 14:10-11</a>).<p>II.PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF THE FOREGOING (<a href="/context/1_corinthians/14-11.htm" title="Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be to him that speaks a barbarian, and he that speaks shall be a barbarian to me.">1Corinthians 14:11-19</a>).<p>(1)What the aim and object of the Christians should be (<a href="/context/1_corinthians/14-12.htm" title="Even so you, for as much as you are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek that you may excel to the edifying of the church.">1Corinthians 14:12-13</a>).<p>(2)His own example (<a href="/context/1_corinthians/14-14.htm" title="For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prays, but my understanding is unfruitful.">1Corinthians 14:14-19</a>).<p>III.FURTHER APPEAL TO THEIR INTELLIGENCE AS TO THIS TRUTH (<a href="/context/1_corinthians/14-21.htm" title="In the law it is written, With men of other tongues and other lips will I speak to this people; and yet for all that will they not hear me, said the LORD.">1Corinthians 14:21-25</a>).<p>(1)The Old Testament teaches the same principle (<a href="/context/1_corinthians/14-21.htm" title="In the law it is written, With men of other tongues and other lips will I speak to this people; and yet for all that will they not hear me, said the LORD.">1Corinthians 14:21-22</a>).<p>(2)The gift of prophecy is a means of spreading Christianity, and the gift of tongues is not (<a href="/context/1_corinthians/14-23.htm" title="If therefore the whole church be come together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in those that are unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not say that you are mad?">1Corinthians 14:23-25</a>).<p><span class= "bld">In the spirit he speaketh mysteries.</span>—The utterances come, not from his mind, but from his spirit, stirred by the Holy Spirit; and he speaks mysteries unintelligible to others.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/14.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>14:1-5 Prophesying, that is, explaining Scripture, is compared with speaking with tongues. This drew attention, more than the plain interpretation of Scripture; it gratified pride more, but promoted the purposes of Christian charity less; it would not equally do good to the souls of men. What cannot be understood, never can edify. No advantage can be reaped from the most excellent discourses, if delivered in language such as the hearers cannot speak or understand. Every ability or possession is valuable in proportion to its usefulness. Even fervent, spiritual affection must be governed by the exercise of the understanding, else men will disgrace the truths they profess to promote.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue - This verse is designed to show that the faculty of speaking intelligibly, and to the edification of the church, is of more value than the power of speaking a foreign language. The reason is, that however valuable may be the endowment in itself, and however important the truth which he may utter, yet it is as if he spoke to God only. No one could understand him.<p>Speaketh not unto men - Does not speak so that people can understand him. His address is really not made to people, that is, to the church. He might have this faculty without being able to speak to the edification of the church. It is possible that the power of speaking foreign languages and of prophesying were sometimes united in the same person; but it is evident that the apostle speaks of them as different endowments, and they probably were found usually in different individuals.<p>But unto God - It is as if he spoke to God. No one could understand him but God. This must evidently refer to the addresses "in the church," when Christians only were present, or when those only were present who spoke the same language, and who were unacquainted with foreign tongues. Paul says that "there" that faculty would be valueless compared with the power of speaking in a manner that should edify the church. He did not undervalue the power of speaking foreign languages when foreigners were present, or when they went to preach to foreigners; see <a href="/1_corinthians/14-22.htm">1 Corinthians 14:22</a>. It was only when it was needless, when all present spoke one language, that he speaks of it as of comparatively little value.<p>For no man understandeth him - That is, no man in the church, since they all spoke the same language, and that language was different from what was spoken by him who was endowed with the gift of tongues. As God only could know the import of what he said, it would be lost upon the church, and would be useless.<p>Howbeit in the Spirit - Although, by the aid of the Spirit, he should, in fact, deliver the most important and sublime truths. This would doubtless be the case, that those who were thus endowed would deliver most important truths, but they would be "lost" upon those who heard them, because they could not understand them. The phrase "in the Spirit," evidently means "by the Holy Spirit," that is, by his aid and influence. Though he should be "really" under the influence of the Holy Spirit, and though the important truth which he delivers should be imparted by his aid, yet all would be valueless unless it were understood by the church.<p>He speaketh mysteries - For the meaning of the word "mystery," see Note, <a href="/1_corinthians/2-7.htm">1 Corinthians 2:7</a>. The word here seems to be synonymous with sublime and elevated truth; truth that was not before known, and that might be of the utmost importance. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. speaketh &#8230; unto God&#8212;who alone understands all languages.<p>no man understandeth&#8212;generally speaking; the few who have the gift of interpreting tongues are the exception.<p>in the spirit&#8212;as opposed to "the understanding" (1Co 14:14).<p>mysteries&#8212;unintelligible to the hearers, exciting their wonder, rather than instructing them. Corinth, being a mart resorted to by merchants from Asia, Africa, and Europe, would give scope amidst its mixed population for the exercise of the gift of tongues; but its legitimate use was in an audience understanding the tongue of the speaker, not, as the Corinthians abused it, in mere display.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_corinthians/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue; </span> by a <span class="ital">tongue</span> (for <span class="ital">unkown</span> is not in the Greek, but necessarily added by our translators, for he speaketh of such a language) he meaneth a language not known to all, or at least not to the most of them that hear him. It may be asked, what unknown language the apostle here meaneth? Shall we think that any pastors or teachers in the church of Corinth were so vain, as to preach in the Arabic, Scythian, or Parthian language to a people who understood only the Greek? Our learned Lightfoot thinks this not probable, and that if any had been so vain for ostentation, the apostle would rather have chid them for suffering such an abuse, and have forbidden such further practice, than have given direction, than if any so spake he should interpret, as he doth, <span class="bld"><a href="/1_corinthians/14-5.htm" title="I would that you all spoke with tongues but rather that you prophesied: for greater is he that prophesies than he that speaks with tongues, except he interpret, that the church may receive edifying.">1 Corinthians 14:5</a></span>. He rather thinks, therefore, that the apostle meaneth the Hebrew tongue; the use of which, though it was by this time much lost through the Jews’ mixture with other nations, yet was restored in a great measure to the guides of churches, for their better understanding the Scriptures of the Old Testament; and continued amongst the Jews in their reading of the law in the synagogues. Now there being many Jews in this church, and the service of God being ordinarily in the Jewish synagogues performed in that language, it is very probable, that some of these Jews that were Christianized (to show their skill) might, when they spake to the whole church of Corinth, use to speak in Hebrew, though few or none understood that language. The apostle saith, he that did so, spake <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">not unto men, </span> that is, not to those men who did not understand that language, not to the generality of his hearers, though possibly here and there some might understand him, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">but unto God, </span> who being the Author of all languages, must necessarily know the significancy of all words in them: for (he saith) scarce any man understood him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries; </span> howbeit he may speak mysterious things to himself, and to the understanding of his own soul and spirit. Others think that it was possible, that some who thus spake, being but the instruments of the Holy Spirit, might not themselves understand all which they said; but that is hardly probable. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_corinthians/14.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue,.... Or with tongues, as some copies and the Ethiopic version read: Dr. Lightfoot thinks, that the Hebrew tongue, which was become a dead language, and understood but by few, is here meant, and that not without reason; seeing the public prayers, preaching, and singing of psalms among the Jews, were in this languages (x); in imitation of whom, such ministers, who had the gift of speaking this language, read the Scriptures, preached, prayed, and sung psalms in it, which were no ways to the edification of the people, who understood it not; upon which account the apostle recommends prophesying, praying, and singing, in a language that was understood: otherwise he <p>speaketh not unto men; to the understanding, profit, and edification of men: but unto God: to his praise and glory, and he only knowing, who knows all languages, and every word in the tongue what is said; excepting himself, unless there should be any present capable of interpreting: <p>for no man understandeth him: or "heareth him": that is, hears him, so as to understand him; he may hear a sound, but he cannot tell the meaning of it, and so it is of no use and advantage to him: <p>howbeit in the Spirit he speaketh mysteries; though under the influence and by the extraordinary gift of the Spirit he has, and to his own Spirit and understanding, and with great affection and devotion within himself, he speaks of the deep things of God, and the mysteries of his grace, the most glorious truths of the Gospel, yet the meaning of his voice and words not being known, he is a barbarian to them that hear him; and though what he delivers are truths of the greatest importance, they are a mere jargon to others, being unintelligible. <p>(x) Vid.

For why was it given? The answer: so that the mysteries of God might be the better known to a greater number. By this it is evident that prophecy, which the gift of tongues ought to serve, is better than this: and therefore the Corinthians judged incorrectly, in that they made more account of the gift of tongues than of prophesying: because no doubt the gift of tongues was a thing more to be bragged of. And hereupon followed another abuse of the gift of tongues, in that the Corinthians used tongues in the congregation without an interpreter. And although this thing might be done to some profit of him that spoke them, yet he corrupted the right use of that gift because there came by it no profit to the hearers. And common assemblies were instituted and appointed not for any private man's commodity, but for the profit of the whole company.<p>(b) A strange language, which no man can understand without an interpreter.<p>(c) By that inspiration which he has received of the Spirit, which nonetheless he abuses, when he speaks mysteries which none of the company can understand.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/1_corinthians/14.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/context/1_corinthians/14-2.htm" title="For he that speaks in an unknown tongue speaks not to men, but to God: for no man understands him; however, in the spirit he speaks mysteries....">1 Corinthians 14:2-3</a> give the ground of the <span class="greekheb">μᾶλλον δὲ ἵνα προφ</span>. by comparing prophecy with the <span class="ital">glossolalia</span> in particular, which was in such high repute among the Corinthians.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">For he who speaks with the tongue</span> (see on <a href="/1_corinthians/12-10.htm" title="To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues:">1 Corinthians 12:10</a>) <span class="ital">speaks not to men</span> (does not with his discourse stand in the relation of communicating to men), <span class="ital">but to God</span>, who understands the Holy Spirit’s deepest and most fervent movements in prayer (<a href="/romans/8-26.htm" title="Likewise the Spirit also helps our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.">Romans 8:26</a> f.).

Probably it is this word, not found in the original, which has given rise to the perplexing, unhistoric, and unwarranted theory that "the gift of tongues" was a power of speaking in foreign languages. <span class="cmt_word">Speaketh not unto men</span>. Because, as a rule, no one understands anything that he says. The word literally means "hears." It may, perhaps, imply that no special attention was given to those who gave way to these impulses of utterance. The whole of this chapter proves in a most striking way the close analogy between "the tongue" and the impassioned soliloquies of inarticulate utterance which were poured forth in tones of thrilling power among the Montanists, and in modern times among the Irvingites. <span class="cmt_word">In the spirit.</span> It is uncertain whether this means "in his own spirit," or "in the Spirit of God," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as a result of inspiration. Probably the former (<a href="/john/4-24.htm">John 4:24</a>; <a href="/romans/8-13.htm">Romans 8:13</a>, etc.). Perhaps, however, the two imply the same thing. The spirit is the one Divine part of our human being, and when a man is a true Christian his spirit is in union with, is as it were lost in, the Spirit of God. St. Paul recognizes the true tongue - for it might be <span class="accented">simulated</span> by hysteria and even by mere physical imposture - as a result of inspiration, that is, of the overpowering dominance of the human spirit by a supernatural power. Nevertheless, he points out the extreme peril of yielding to or self inducing these emotions public, or in leaving them uncontrolled. <span class="cmt_word">Mysteries.</span> Secrets revealed possibly to him, but unrevealed by this strange "tongue" to others. </body></html>
