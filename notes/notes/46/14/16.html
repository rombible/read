A truly Christian minister will seek much more to do spiritual good to men's souls, than to get the greatest applause to himself. This is proving himself the servant of Christ. Children are apt to be struck with novelty; but do not act like them. Christians should be like children, void of guile and malice; yet they should not be unskilful as to the word of righteousness, but only as to the arts of mischief. It is a proof that a people are forsaken of God, when he gives them up to the rule of those who teach them to worship in another language. They can never be benefitted by such teaching. Yet thus the preachers did who delivered their instructions in an unknown tongue. Would it not make Christianity ridiculous to a heathen, to hear the ministers pray or preach in a language which neither he nor the assembly understood? But if those who minister, plainly interpret Scripture, or preach the great truths and rules of the gospel, a heathen or unlearned person might become a convert to Christianity. His conscience might be touched, the secrets of his heart might be revealed to him, and so he might be brought to confess his guilt, and to own that God was present in the assembly. Scripture truth, plainly and duly taught, has a wonderful power to awaken the conscience and touch the heart.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Else - (&#x395;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;  Epei). Since; if this is not done; if what is said is not intelligible, how shall the unlearned be able appropriately to express his assent, and join in your devotions?<p>When thou shalt bless - When thou shalt bless God, or give thanks to him. If thou shalt lead the devotions of the people in expressing thanksgiving for mercies and favors. This may refer to a part of public worship, or to the thanks which should be expressed at table, and the invocation of the divine blessing to attend the bounties of his providence. Paul had illustrated his subject by prayer and by singing; be now does it by a reference to the important part of public worship expressed in giving thanks.<p>With the spirit - In the manner referred to above; that is, in an unknown tongue, in such a way that your own "heart" may be engaged in it, but which would be unintelligible to others.<p>He that occupieth the room - Is in the place, or the seat of the unlearned; that is, he who is unlearned. On the meaning of the word "room," see the note at <a href="/luke/14-8.htm">Luke 14:8</a>. To "fill" a place means to occupy a station, or to be found in a slate or condition.<p>Of the unlearned - (&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b9;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;  tou idio&#772;tou. On the meaning of this word, see the note at <a href="/acts/4-13.htm">Acts 4:13</a>. Here it means one who was unacquainted with the foreign language spoken by him who gave thanks. It properly denotes a man in "private," in contradistinction from a man in "public" life; and hence, a man who is ignorant and unlettered, as such people generally were.<p>Say Amen - This word means "truly, verily;" and is an expression of affirmation <a href="/john/3-5.htm">John 3:5</a> or of assent. Here it means assent. How can he pronounce "the" Amen; how can he express his assent; how can he join in the act of devotion? This "might" have been, and probably "was," expressed aloud; and there is no impropriety in it. It "may," however, be "mental" - a silent assent to what is said, and a silent uniting in the act of thanksgiving. In one way or the other, or in both, the assent should always be expressed by those who join in acts of public worship. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16.

Which must be understood of giving thanks to God, not in a private way, in the family and at meals, but in a public manner before the whole congregation, for mercies temporal and spiritual, especially the latter; and that not with the breath, or voice only; nor with the affections of the heart, with the soul, and all that is within it, though that is what should be; nor with the common assistance of the Spirit, and under the influence of his grace, which excites to true gratitude; but with the extraordinary gift of the Spirit, pronouncing the blessing, or expressing the thanksgiving with divers tongues, or in an unknown language: when this part of divine service, which by the way is distinct from singing, is performed in this manner, <p>how shall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned;  "idiot". The word  "idiot", is often used by the Jewish writers, and signifies a plebeian, one of the common people; and is sometimes indeed distinguished from a wise man, or a learned man; but frequently signifies a private person, whether learned or unlearned, that is not in so high a post as others; hence we read (c) , "of private judges", which were not of the great sanhedrim, and of private men, as distinguished from kings (d); <p>"there are three kings, and four  "private men", (the Jews say,) that have no part in the world to come; the three kings are Jeroboam, Ahab, and Manasseh; the four private persons are Balsam, Doeg, Ahithophel, and Gehazi:'' <p>here a private man is distinguished from the public minister that blesses, or gives thanks in the name of the people; and not to be understood of a single person, whose place and office it was to say "Amen", at the minister's giving of thanks, and who stood in some particular place for that purpose; but of the whole body of the people, who, in distinction from the minister, were in the condition of private men, and all joined, as will be seen hereafter, in saying "Amen"; now the apostle's question is, that if thou who art a public minister, givest blessing and praise, or returnest thanks to God in an unknown tongue, how shall the common people, or anyone that is in a private capacity, <p>say Amen at thy giving of thanks, seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest? It was usual to say "Amen" at blessing, or giving of thanks privately at meals, by those that were present, concerning which are the following rules (e); <p>"he that breaks the bread, might not break it until the "Amen" was finished out of the mouth of those that answered; Rab Chasdai says out of the mouth of the major part of those that answer:'' <p>and elsewhere (f) it is said, <p>"they answer "Amen" after an Israelite has blessed, but they do not answer "Amen" after a Cuthite (a Samaritan, or any Gentile, or Christian) hath blessed, unless the whole blessing is heard:'' <p>but of this kind of blessing the apostle speaks not, but of blessing in public: upon which all the people, and not a single person only, as with one united voice, said Amen; see <a href="/1_chronicles/16-36.htm">1 Chronicles 16:36</a> to this practice the apostle refers; concerning which the rule (g) is; <p>"that the congregation may not answer "Amen", until the blessing is finished out of the mouth of the priests; and the priests may not begin the other blessing, until the "Amen" is finished out of the mouth of the congregation.'' <p>There were different sorts of "Amen", or rather different pronunciations of it; of which the Jews say (h), <p>"they may not answer with a fatherless "Amen"; nor with a sudden or violent "Amen"; (pronounced quick and in haste;) nor with an "Amen" cut off, or asunder (the last letter of it not pronounced): says Ben Azzai, whoever answers with a fatherless "Amen", his children shall be fatherless; with a quick "Amen", his days will be short; with an "Amen" cut off, his days shall be cut off; and whoever prolongs "Amen", his days and years shall be prolonged.'' <p>Now, , "a fatherless Amen", was when a person answered, and he did not know what he answered (i) to; and such an "Amen", in the case here, must a private man answer with, at the giving of thanks in an unknown tongue; and to answer "Amen" to what was said in a language not understood, was not allowed of; so the woman suspected of adultery was to be sworn and examined by the priest in a language she understood; and was to say "Amen, Amen", to what was said, in a language known to her (k); for if she did not understand it, how could she say "Amen?" which is the apostle's reasoning here: but was this an affair of such importance, to be instanced in and argued upon in this manner? with the Jews it was, who say (l), <p>"that greater is he that answers "Amen", than he that blesses:'' <p>continued...<a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_corinthians/14.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{7}</span> Else when thou shalt bless with the <span class="cverse3">{n}</span> spirit, how shall he that <span class="cverse3">{o}</span> occupieth the room of the unlearned say <span class="cverse3">{p}</span> Amen at thy giving of thanks, seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest?</span><p>(7) Another reason: seeing that the whole congregation must agree with him that speaks, and also witness this agreement, how will they give their assent or agreement who know not what is spoken?<p>(n) Alone, without any consideration of the hearers.<p>(o) He that sits as a private man.<p>(p) So then one uttered the prayers, and all the company answered amen.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/1_corinthians/14.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/1_corinthians/14-16.htm" title="Else when you shall bless with the spirit, how shall he that occupies the room of the unlearned say Amen at your giving of thanks, seeing he understands not what you say?">1 Corinthians 14:16</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἐπεί</span>] <span class="ital">for</span>, without this <span class="greekheb">ψάλλειν καὶ τῷ νοΐ</span>, <span class="ital">i.e. otherwise</span> (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-29.htm" title="Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?">1 Corinthians 15:29</a>; <a href="/romans/3-6.htm" title="God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?">Romans 3:6</a>, <span class="ital">al.</span>), the layman, in fact, when thou praisest with the spirit, cannot say the Amen, et.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">εὐλογεῖν</span> and <span class="greekheb">εὐχαριστεῖν</span> denote substantially one and the same thing, the <span class="ital">thanksgiving prayer</span>, the former word referring more to the form of praise to God (<span class="greekheb">ברכה</span>), the latter more to its contents.

Some commentators, e.g. Dean Stanley, have supposed the Eucharistic blessing to be meant (see ch. <a href="/1_corinthians/10-16.htm" title="The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?">1 Corinthians 10:16</a>). This, though probable, is by no means certain. That it was some well-known form of blessing or thanksgiving is however clear from what follows.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">with the spirit</span>] i.e. in an unknown tongue.

Wiclif renders it here by <span class="ital">place</span>. Cf. “office and <span class="ital">roome</span>,” Hollinshead’s <span class="ital">Scotland</span>. The word rendered here <span class="ital">unlearned</span> signifies (1) a <span class="ital">private person, layman</span>, one who holds no office. Hence (2) it comes to signify a man who has no special or technical knowledge of any particular art or science, as in <a href="/acts/4-13.htm" title="Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marveled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.">Acts 4:13</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/11-6.htm" title="But though I be rude in speech, yet not in knowledge; but we have been thoroughly made manifest among you in all things.">2 Corinthians 11:6</a>, just as a lawyer calls those <span class="ital">laymen</span> who are not versed in law. Therefore the meaning here most probably is (with Meyer and Bp. Wordsworth) “those who have no special gift such as that of prophecy, or tongues.” Some would render ‘<span class="ital">the layman’s place</span>,’ and regard it as referring to the seats set apart for the laity in the assembly. But the majority of commentators would render <span class="ital">he who fills the situation of the not specially endowed</span>.

It is a common phrase among the Hebrews, <span class="ital">he fills the place of his fathers, i.e.</span>, he shows himself worthy of his ancestors.—<span class="greekheb">πῶς ἐρεῖ τὸ ἀμὴν</span>, <span class="ital">how shall he say amen</span>) This was their usual practice even at that time; not only the unlearned, but all the hearers spoke, giving their assent to <span class="ital">him who blessed</span>.

In the Septuagint it does not occur, but its kindred words are limited to the sense of private, personal. Trench ("Synonyms") illustrates the fact that in classical Greek there lies habitually in the word "a negative of the particular skill, knowledge, profession, or standing, over against which it is antithetically set; and not of any other except that alone." As over against the physician, for instance, he is &#x3b9;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; in being unskilled in medicine. This is plainly the case here - the man who is unlearned as respects the gift of tongues. From the original meaning of a private individual, the word came to denote one who was unfit for public life, and therefore uneducated, and finally, one whose mental powers were deficient. Hence our idiot. Idiot, however, in earlier English, was used in the milder sense of an uneducated person. Thus "Christ was received of idiots, of the vulgar people, and of the simpler sort" (Blount). "What, wenest thou make an idiot of our dame?" (Chaucer, 5893). "This plain and idiotical style of Scripture." "Pictures are the scripture of idiots and simple persons" (Jeremy Taylor).<p>Amen<p>Rev., correctly, the Amen. The customary response of the congregation, adopted from the synagogue worship. See <a href="/deuteronomy/27-15.htm">Deuteronomy 27:15</a> sqq.; <a href="/nehemiah/8-6.htm">Nehemiah 8:6</a>. The Rabbins have numerous sayings about the Amen. "Greater is he who responds Amen than he who blesses." "Whoever answers Amen, his name shall be great and blessed, and the decree of his damnation is utterly done away." "To him who answers Amen the gates of Paradise are open." An ill-considered Amen was styled "an orphan Amen." "Whoever says an orphan Amen, his children shall be orphans." The custom was perpetuated in Christian worship, and this response enters into all the ancient liturgies. Jerome says that the united voice of the people in the Amen sounded like the fall of water or the sound of thunder. </body></html>
