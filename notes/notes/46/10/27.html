To explain this further, “The heathen often, in their own houses, made an ordinary feast of a part of the sacrifice, see on chap. <a href="/1_corinthians/8-1.htm" title="Now as touching things offered to idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but charity edifies.">1 Corinthians 8:1</a>; to these entertainments, the apostle told the Corinthian brethren, they might lawfully go when invited. But on such occasions, if a Christian domestic or slave, by informing them that this or that dish consisted of things which had been sacrificed to an idol, signified that they considered their eating these things as sinful, they were to abstain from them, for the reasons mentioned in the text.” <span class="ital">For the earth is the Lord’s, </span>&c. — This clause, inserted in our copies, is omitted in the Alex. Clermont, and other manuscripts, and the Syriac, Arabic, and Vulgate versions; and some other critics think it disturbs the sense. “But,” says Macknight, “it renders the argument more complete; for the meaning is, The Lord, to whom the earth and all its fulness belong, having allowed men a sufficiency of other wholesome food, no one is under any necessity of offending those who are either ignorant or scrupulous, by eating a particular kind.” <span class="ital">Conscience, I say, not thine own </span>— I speak of his conscience, not thine, lest it be troubled, and his mind be disquieted; <span class="ital">for why is my liberty judged by another’s conscience </span>— I ought not to use my liberty so as to do that which another man thinks in his conscience to be evil, and so judges me a transgressor for it. Or, as Dr. Doddridge paraphrases the verse, “I mean not <span class="ital">thine own conscience </span>immediately, <span class="ital">but that of another </span>person; for how indifferent soever thou mayest esteem the matter, thou art obliged in duty to be very cautious that thou dost not wound and grieve that of thy brother: but you will observe, that I here speak only of acts obvious to human observation; for, as to what immediately lies between God and my own soul, why is my liberty to be judged, arraigned, and condemned at the bar of another man’s conscience? I am not, in such cases, to govern myself by the judgment and apprehension of others; nor have they any authority to judge or censure me for not concurring with them in their own narrow notions and declarations.” Others think it is an objection in the mouths of the Corinthians, and to be thus understood: “But why should I suffer myself to be thus imposed on, and receive law from any, where Christ has left me free?” But the above interpretation seems more probable, which supposes that this and the following verse come in as a kind of parenthesis, to prevent their extending the former caution beyond what he designed by it. <span class="ital">For if I, by grace </span>— The divine favour; <span class="ital">be a partaker </span>— Of the common gifts of Providence; <span class="ital">why am I evil spoken of for </span>my free and cheerful use of <span class="ital">that for which I give thanks </span>— As tracing it up to the hand of the great Supreme Benefactor?<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:23-33 There were cases wherein Christians might eat what had been offered to idols, without sin. Such as when the flesh was sold in the market as common food, for the priest to whom it had been given. But a Christian must not merely consider what is lawful, but what is expedient, and to edify others. Christianity by no means forbids the common offices of kindness, or allows uncourteous behaviour to any, however they may differ from us in religious sentiments or practices. But this is not to be understood of religious festivals, partaking in idolatrous worship. According to this advice of the apostle, Christians should take care not to use their liberty to the hurt of others, or to their own reproach. In eating and drinking, and in all we do, we should aim at the glory of God, at pleasing and honouring him. This is the great end of all religion, and directs us where express rules are wanting. A holy, peaceable, and benevolent spirit, will disarm the greatest enemies.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>If any of them that believe not - That are not Christians; that are still pagans.<p>Bid you to a feast - Evidently not a feast in the temple of an idol, but at his own house.

The Saviour accepted such invitations to dine with the Pharisees (see the note at <a href="/luke/11-37.htm">Luke 11:37</a>); and Christianity is not designed to abolish the courtesies of social life; or to break the bonds of contact; or to make people misanthropes or hermits. It allows and cultivates, under proper Christian restraints, the contact in society which will promote the comfort of people, and especially that which may extend the usefulness of Christians. It does not require, therefore, that we should withdraw from social life, or regard as improper the courtesies of society; see the note at <a href="/1_corinthians/5-10.htm">1 Corinthians 5:10</a>.<p>Whatsoever is set before you ... - Whether it has been offered in sacrifice or not; for so the connection requires us to understand it.<p>Eat - This should be interpreted strictly. The apostle says "eat," not "drink;" and the principle will not authorize us to "drink" whatever is set before us, asking no questions for conscience sake; for while it was matter of indifference in regard to eating, whether the meat had been sacrificed to idols or not, it is not a matter of indifference whether a man may drink intoxicating liquor. That is a point on which the "conscience" should have much to do; and on which its honest decisions, and the will of the Lord, should be faithfully and honestly regarded. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>27. ye be disposed to go&#8212;tacitly implying, they would be as well not to go, but yet not forbidding them to go (1Co 10:9) [Grotius].

Although some of the Corinthians had gone so far as to declare that a Christian might innocently sit at meat in the idol temple, confident in his conviction that an idol was ‘nothing in the world’ (ch. <a href="/1_corinthians/8-10.htm" title="For if any man see you which have knowledge sit at meat in the idol's temple, shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols;">1 Corinthians 8:10</a>), yet the Christian religion could not permit them thus to abuse their freedom.
