It is noticeable that St. Paul attributes the death of the people to the Destroyer—<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> God’s messenger sent to destroy—while in Numbers they are said to have perished by the “plague.” Every pestilence that swept over nations to purify them was a messenger from God.

Let us fear the sins of Israel, if we would shun their plagues. And it is but just to fear, that such as tempt Christ, will be left by him in the power of the old serpent. Murmuring against God's disposals and commands, greatly provokes him. Nothing in Scripture is written in vain; and it is our wisdom and duty to learn from it. Others have fallen, and so may we. The Christian's security against sin is distrust of himself. God has not promised to keep us from falling, if we do not look to ourselves. To this word of caution, a word of comfort is added. Others have the like burdens, and the like temptations: what they bear up under, and break through, we may also. God is wise as well as faithful, and will make our burdens according to our strength. He knows what we can bear. He will make a way to escape; he will deliver either from the trial itself, or at least the mischief of it. We have full encouragement to flee from sin, and to be faithful to God. We cannot fall by temptation, if we cleave fast to him. Whether the world smiles or frowns, it is an enemy; but believers shall be strengthened to overcome it, with all its terrors and enticements. The fear of the Lord, put into their hearts, will be the great means of safety.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Neither murmur ye - Do not repine at the allotments of Providence, or complain of His dealings.<p>As some of them also murmured - <a href="/numbers/14-2.htm">Numbers 14:2</a>. The ground of their complaining was, that they had been disappointed; that they had been brought out of a land of plenty into a wilderness of want; and that instead of being conducted at once to the land of promise, they were left to perish in the desert. They therefore complained of their leaders, and proposed to return again into Egypt.<p>And were destroyed of the destroyer - That is, they were doomed to die in the wilderness without seeing the land of Canaan; <a href="/exodus/14-29.htm">Exodus 14:29</a>. The "destroyer" here is understood by many to mean the "angel of death," so often referred to in the Old Testament, and usually called by the Jews "Sammael." The work of death, however, is attributed to an angel in <a href="/exodus/12-23.htm">Exodus 12:23</a>; compare <a href="/hebrews/11-28.htm">Hebrews 11:28</a>.

The people of Israel were very prone unto, and often guilty of this sin; but what the apostle here has respect unto, is either their murmuring upon the report the spies made of the good land, in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/14-1.htm">Numbers 14:1</a>, or that of Korah and his company against Moses and Aaron, as principal officers, who were for setting all upon a level; and of all the people against them, for the death of these men, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/16-1.htm">Numbers 16:1</a>, <p>and were destroyed of the destroyer; meaning either some judgment of God upon them, as the earth's opening and swallowing up Korah and all that belonged unto him; and the fire that came down from heaven, and consumed the two hundred and fifty men that offered incense; and the plague which swept away fourteen thousand and seven hundred of those that murmured against Moses and Aaron, on the account of the death of the said persons; and any other judgment by which the carcasses of those fell in the wilderness, that murmured upon the report of the spies; or else since angels were usually employed by God, in inflicting such judgments, by the destroyer may be meant an angel, such an one as smote the firstborn in Egypt, and bears the same name, <a href="/hebrews/11-28.htm">Hebrews 11:28</a> and as smote Israel with a pestilence upon David's numbering the people, and was about to have destroyed Jerusalem, had he not been restrained, <a href="/2_samuel/24-15.htm">2 Samuel 24:15</a> and as, smote an hundred fourscore and five thousand in the camp of the Assyrians, in one night, <a href="/2_kings/19-35.htm">2 Kings 19:35</a>. So that though an angel may be intended, it is not necessary, on account of the character given him, to understand an evil angel; it is true indeed, that Satan is by the Jews (a) called  "the destroyer"; and Samuel, the same with Satan, is called "the angel of death"; to which the allusion is in <a href="/hebrews/2-14.htm">Hebrews 2:14</a> and evil angels are frequently styled , "destroying angels" (b); as distinct from ministering ones, and to which some think the apostle here refers. <p>(a) T.
