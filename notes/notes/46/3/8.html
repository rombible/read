This is, however, not a thing to be noticed by men, but it will be recognised by the great Master.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_corinthians/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/1_corinthians/3-8.htm" title="Now he that plants and he that waters are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labor....">1 Corinthians 3:8-9</a></span>. <span class="ital">He that planteth and he that watereth are one </span>— United in affection, and engaged in one general design, the design of glorifying God in the salvation of souls, though their labours may be in some respect different: and hence, instead of being pleased, we are rather displeased and grieved with those invidious comparisons in favour of one against another. Our great concern is to please our common Lord, to whom we are shortly to give up our account; <span class="ital">and </span>from whom <span class="ital">every man </span>— He primarily means every minister of Christ; <span class="ital">shall receive his own reward — </span>The reward in some respects peculiar to himself; <span class="ital">according to his own </span>peculiar <span class="ital">labour </span>— For as some labour with greater zeal and diligence, and others with less, so they shall be rewarded with different degrees of felicity and glory. He does not say, according to his success, because he who labours much, supposing he labours with a single eye to the glory of God, from a principle of love to him, and a conscientious regard to his will, shall have a great reward, though it may please God to give him little success. Has not all this reasoning the same force still? Ministers are still barely instruments in God’s hand, and depend as entirely as ever on his blessing, to give the increase to their labours. Without this they are nothing; with it their part is so small, that they hardly deserve to be mentioned. May their hearts and hands be more united; and, retaining a due sense of the honour God doth them in employing them, may they faithfully labour, not as for themselves, but for the great Proprietor of all, till the day come when he will reward them in full proportion to their fidelity and diligence! <span class="ital">For we are labourers together, </span>&c. — Greek, <span class="greekheb">Θεου γαρ εσμεν συνεργοι</span>, <span class="ital">we are fellow- labourers of God; </span>or, we are God’s labourers, and fellow-labourers with each other. <span class="ital">Ye are God’s husbandry </span>— Or God’s tillage, God’s cultivated ground: a comprehensive word, taking in a field, a garden, and a vineyard.

We should not put ministers into the place of God. He that planteth and he that watereth are one, employed by one Master, trusted with the same revelation, busied in one work, and engaged in one design. They have their different gifts from one and the same Spirit, for the very same purposes; and should carry on the same design heartily. Those who work hardest shall fare best. Those who are most faithful shall have the greatest reward. They work together with God, in promoting the purposes of his glory, and the salvation of precious souls; and He who knows their work, will take care they do not labour in vain. They are employed in his husbandry and building; and He will carefully look over them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Are one - &#x3b5;&#788;&#769;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;  hen eisin. They are not the same person; but they are one in the following respects:<p>(1) They are united in reference to the same work. Though they are engaged in different things - for planting and watering are different kinds of work, yet it is one in regard to the end to be gained. The employments do not at all clash, but tend to the same end. It is not as if one planted, and the other was engaged in pulling up.<p>(2) their work is one, because one is as necessary as the other. If the grain was not planted there would be no use in pouring water there; if not watered, there would be no use in planting. The work of one is as necessary, therefore, as the other; and the one should not undervalue the labors of the other.<p>(3) they are one in regard to God. They are both engaged in performing one work; God is performing another. There are not three parties or portions of the work, but two. They two perform one part of the work; God alone performs the other. Theirs would be useless without him; he would not ordinarily perform his without their performing their part. They could not do his part it they would - as they cannot make a plant grow; he could perform their part - as he could plant and water without the farmer; but it is not in accordance with his arrangements to do it.<p>And every man - The argument of the apostle here has reference only to ministers; but it is equally true of all people, that they shall receive their proper reward.<p>Shall receive - On the Day of Judgment, when God decides the destiny of men. The decisions of that Day will be simply determining what every moral agent ought to receive.<p>His own reward - His fit, or proper (&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3b9;&#787;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  ton idion) reward; that which pertains to him, or which shall be a proper expression of the character and value of his labor - The word "reward" &#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd;  misthon denotes properly that which is given by contract for service rendered; an equivalent in value for services or for kindness; see the note at <a href="/romans/4-4.htm">Romans 4:4</a>. In the Scriptures it denotes pay, wages, recompense given to day-laborers, to soldiers, etc. It is applied often, as here, to the retribution which God will make to people on the Day of Judgment; and is applied to the "favors" which he will then bestow on them, or to the "punishment" which he will inflict as the reward of their deeds. Instances of the former sense occur in <a href="/matthew/5-12.htm">Matthew 5:12</a>; 6; <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/6-23.htm">Luke 6:23</a>, <a href="/luke/6-35.htm">Luke 6:35</a>; <a href="/revelation/11-18.htm">Revelation 11:18</a>; of the latter in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_peter/2-13.htm">2 Peter 2:13</a>, <a href="/2_peter/2-15.htm">2 Peter 2:15</a> - In regard to the righteous, it does not imply merit, or that they deserve heaven; but it means that, God will render to them that which, according to the terms of his new covenant, he has promised, and which shall be a fit expression of his acceptance of their services. It is proper, according to these arrangements, that they should be blessed in heaven. It would not be proper that they should be cast down to hell - Their original and their sole title to eternal life is the grace of God through Jesus Christ: the "measure," or "amount" of the favors bestowed on them there, shall be according to the services which they render on earth. A parent may resolve to divide his estate among his sons, and their title to any thing may be derived from his mere favor but he may determine that it shall be divided according to their expressions of attachment, and to their obedience to him. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. one&#8212;essentially in their aim they are one, engaged in one and the same ministry; therefore they ought not to be made by you the occasion of forming separate parties.<p>and every man&#8212;rather "but every man." Though in their service or ministry, they are essentially "one," yet every minister is separately responsible in "his own" work, and "shall receive his own (emphatically repeated) reward, according to his own labor." The reward is something over and above personal salvation (1Co 3:14, 15; 2Jo 8). He shall be rewarded according to, not his success or the amount of work done, but "according to his own labor." It shall be said to him, "Well done, thou good and (not successful, but) faithful servant, enter thou into the joy of thy Lord" (Mt 25:23).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_corinthians/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The ministers of Christ, though one be used in planting and another in watering, one in laying the foundation and another in building thereupon, yet <span class="ital">are one; </span> one in their office and work, one in their ministry, being all servants to Christ, who is one; all serving one and the same Lord, all doing the same business, proposing the same end, and with all their might labouring towards it; and therefore, as they ought not to divide into parties and factions, so you ought not for their sakes to be so divided. Yet they are not so one, but that one may labour more than another, and be honoured by God with more success than another, and every one shall receive a reward proportioned to his labour: the apostle saith not, according to the success of his labour, (that is not in his power), but, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">according to his labour.</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_corinthians/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Now he that planteth, and he that watereth are one,....
