The wisdom that wordly men esteem, is foolishness with God. How justly does he despise, and how easily can he baffle and confound it! The thoughts of the wisest men in the world, have vanity, weakness, and folly in them. All this should teach us to be humble, and make us willing to be taught of God, so as not to be led away, by pretences to human wisdom and skill, from the simple truths revealed by Christ. Mankind are very apt to oppose the design of the mercies of God. Observe the spiritual riches of a true believer; All are yours, even ministers and ordinances. Nay, the world itself is yours. Saints have as much of it as Infinite Wisdom sees fit for them, and they have it with the Divine blessing. Life is yours, that you may have a season and opportunity to prepare for the life of heaven; and death is yours, that you may go to the possession of it. It is the kind messenger to take you from sin and sorrow, and to guide you to your Father's house. Things present are yours, for your support on the road; things to come are yours, to delight you for ever at your journey's end. If we belong to Christ, and are true to him, all good belongs to us, and is sure to us. Believers are the subjects of his kingdom. He is Lord over us, we must own his dominion, and cheerfully submit to his command. God in Christ, reconciling a sinful world to himself, and pouring the riches of his grace on a reconciled world, is the sum and substance of the gospel.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For the wisdom of this world - That which is esteemed to be wisdom by the people of this world on the subject of religion. It does not mean that true wisdom is foolishness with him. It does not mean that science, and prudence, and law - that the knowledge of his works - that astronomy, and medicine, and chemistry, are regarded by him as folly, and as unworthy the attention of people. God is the friend of truth on all subjects; and he requires us to become acquainted with his works, and commends those who search them, <a href="/psalms/92-4.htm">Psalm 92:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/111-2.htm">Psalm 111:2</a>. But the apostle refers here to that which was esteemed to be wisdom among the ancients, and in which they so much prided themselves, their vain, self-confident, and false opinions on the subject of religion; and especially those opinions when they were opposed to the simple but sublime truths of revelation.

The word rendered "taketh" here denotes to clench with the fist, gripe, grasp. And the sense is:<p>(1) However crafty, or cunning, or skillful they may be; however self-confident, yet that they cannot deceive or impose upon God. He can thwart their plans, overthrow their schemes, defeat their counsels, and foil them in their enterprises, <a href="/job/5-12.htm">Job 5:12</a>.<p>(2) he does it by their own cunning or craftiness. He allows them to involve themselves in difficulties or to entangle each other. He makes use of even their own craft and cunning to defeat their counsels. He allows the plans of one wise man to come in conflict with those of another, and thus to destroy one another. Honesty in religion, as in everything else, is the best policy; and a man who pursues a course of conscientious integrity may expect the protection of God. But he who attempts to carry his purposes by craft and intrigue - who depends on skill and cunning instead of truth and honesty, will often find that he is the prey of his own cunning and duplicity. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19. with God&#8212;in the judgment of God.<p>it is written&#8212;in Job 5:13.

Kosmos</span> is the world regarded objectively; <span class="accented">aion</span> the world regarded in its moral and intellectual aspect. <span class="cmt_word">He that taketh the wise in their craftiness</span>. This is one of the few references to the Book of Job in the New Testament. It comes from the speech of Eliphaz in <a href="/job/5-13.htm">Job 5:13</a>, but St. Paul substitutes the words "clutching" (<span class="accented">drassomenos</span>) and "craftiness" (<span class="accented">panourgia</span>) for the milder <span class="accented">katalabon</span> and <span class="accented">phronesei of</span> the LXX. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/1_corinthians/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>He taketh (&#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;)<p>Cited from <a href="//biblehub.com/job/5-13.htm">Job 5:13</a>, but not following the Septuagint verbally. The verb occurs only here, meaning to grasp with the hand. Rev., more accurately, gives the force of the participle with the article, he that taketh. This is the only allusion to the book of Job in the New Testament, except <a href="/james/5-11.htm">James 5:11</a>. </body></html>
