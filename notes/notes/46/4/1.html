Though servants, their office is one of great trust; they are “stewards” to whom the owner of the house has entrusted the care of those sacred things—“mysteries”—which heretofore have been hidden, but are now made known to them, his faithful subordinates. It is to be remembered that even the steward in a Greek household was generally a slave.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_corinthians/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/1_corinthians/4-1.htm" title="Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.">1 Corinthians 4:1</a></span>. <span class="ital">Let a man, </span>&c. — Having warned the believers at Corinth against entertaining an undue esteem for their own ministers, he now proceeds to show them in what light they ought to view all true ministers of Christ: and lest, from what was advanced in the preceding chapters concerning the inspiration of the apostles by the Holy Spirit, these Corinthians should imagine that Paul claimed to himself and his brethren an authority not derived from Christ, he here tells them that even the apostles were only Christ’s servants; obliged in all things to act in entire subjection to him, and obedience to his will. <span class="ital">So account of us as of the ministers of Christ </span>— The original word, <span class="greekheb">υπηρετας</span>, properly signifies such servants as laboured at the oar in rowing vessels, and accordingly intimates the pains which every faithful minister of Christ takes in his Lord’s work.

They had a great trust, and for that reason, had an honourable office. Paul had a just concern for his own reputation, but he knew that he who chiefly aimed to please men, would not prove himself a faithful servant of Christ. It is a comfort that men are not to be our final judges. And it is not judging well of ourselves, or justifying ourselves, that will prove us safe and happy. Our own judgment is not to be depended upon as to our faithfulness, any more than our own works for our justification. There is a day coming, that will bring men's secret sins into open day, and discover the secrets of their hearts. Then every slandered believer will be justified, and every faithful servant approved and rewarded. The word of God is the best rule by which to judge as to men. Pride commonly is at the bottom of quarrels. Self-conceit contributes to produce undue esteem of our teachers, as well as of ourselves. We shall not be puffed up for one against another, if we remember that all are instruments, employed by God, and endowed by him with various talents.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Let a man - Let all; let this be the estimate formed of us by each one of you.<p>So account of us - So think of us, the apostles.<p>As the ministers of Christ - As the servants of Christ.

The office of steward was to provide those things which were necessary for the use of a family. And so the office of a minister of the gospel, and a steward of its mysteries, is to dispense such instructions, guidance, counsel, etc., as may be requisite to build up the church of Christ; to make known those sublime truths which are contained in the gospel, but which had not been made known before the revelation of Jesus Christ, and which are, therefore, called "mysteries." It is implied in this verse:<p>(1) That the office of a minister is one that is subordinate to Christ - they are his servants.<p>(2) that those in the office should not attempt to be the head of sect or party in the church.<p>(3) that the office is honorable as that of a steward is; and,<p>(4) That Christians should endeavor to form and cherish just ideas of ministers; to give them their TRUE honor; but not to overrate their importance. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 4<p>1Co 4:1-21.

Not the depositories of grace, but dispensers of it ("rightly dividing" or dispensing it), so far as God gives us it, to others. The chazan, or "overseer," in the synagogue answered to the bishop or "angel" of the Church, who called seven of the synagogue to read the law every sabbath, and oversaw them. The parnasin of the synagogue, like the ancient "deacon" of the Church, took care of the poor (Ac 6:1-7) and subsequently preached in subordination to the presbyters or bishops, as Stephen and Philip did. The Church is not the appendage to the priesthood; but the minister is the steward of God to the Church. Man shrinks from too close contact with God; hence he willingly puts a priesthood between, and would serve God by deputy. The pagan (like the modern Romish) priest was rather to conceal than to explain "the mysteries of God." The minister's office is to "preach" (literally, "proclaim as a herald," Mt 10:27) the deep truths of God ("mysteries," heavenly truths, only known by revelation), so far as they have been revealed, and so far as his hearers are disposed to receive them. Josephus says that the Jewish religion made known to all the people the mysteries of their religion, while the pagans concealed from all but the "initiated" few, the mysteries of theirs.<span class="bld"><a href="/context/1_corinthians/4-1.htm" title="Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God....">1 Corinthians 4:1-5</a></span> Paul showeth in what account such as he should be<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>held, of whose fidelity it should be left to God<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>to judge.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><a href="/1_corinthians/4-6.htm" title="And these things, brothers, I have in a figure transferred to myself and to Apollos for your sakes; that you might learn in us not to think of men above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against another.">1 Corinthians 4:6</a>,7</span> He dissuadeth the Corinthians from valuing<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>themselves in one teacher above another,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>since all had their respective distinctions<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>from God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><a href="/context/1_corinthians/4-8.htm" title="Now you are full, now you are rich, you have reigned as kings without us: and I would to God you did reign, that we also might reign with you....">1 Corinthians 4:8-13</a></span> To their self-sufficient vanity he opposeth his<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>own despised and afflicted state,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><a href="/context/1_corinthians/4-14.htm" title="I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn you....">1 Corinthians 4:14-16</a></span> warning them, as their only father in Christ, and<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>urging theme to follow him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><a href="/context/1_corinthians/4-17.htm" title="For this cause have I sent to you Timotheus, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church....">1 Corinthians 4:17-21</a></span> For the same cause he sent Timotheus, and meant<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>soon to follow in person, when he would inquire<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>into the authority of such as opposed him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The apostle here gives us the right notion of the preachers of the gospel; they are but <span class="bld">ministers, </span> that is, servants, so as the honour that is proper to their Master, for a principal efficiency in the conversion and building up of souls, belongeth not to them; they are <span class="bld">ministers of Christ, </span> so have their primary relation to him, and only a secondary relation to the church to which they are ministers; they are <span class="ital">ministers of Christ</span> and so in that ministration can only execute what are originally his commands, though those commands of Christ may also be enforced by men: ministers of the gospel, not of the law, upon whom lies a primary obligation to preach Christ and his gospel unto people.

And he is appointed to dispense the <span class="ital">mysteries</span> of the Gospel. This word is derived from a word signifying <span class="ital">to close, to shut</span>, and was in the old Greek civilization used to denote those rites which were only permitted to the initiated, and were kept a strict secret from the outside world. Of such a kind were the well-known Eleusinian mysteries, which were kept every fifth year at Eleusis in Attica, the rites of the Bona Dea, which were observed at Rome, and those of Isis and Mithras, which were of Egyptian and Persian origin. (See Article “Mysteria” in Smith’s <span class="ital">Dictionary of Antiquities</span>.) The word is used in Scripture in two senses, (1) for things hidden from the ordinary understanding, (2) of things formerly concealed in the counsels of God but revealed to those who believe the Gospel. We have examples of the former meaning in ch. <a href="/1_corinthians/13-2.htm" title="And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.">1 Corinthians 13:2</a> and <a href="/1_corinthians/14-2.htm" title="For he that speaks in an unknown tongue speaks not to men, but to God: for no man understands him; however, in the spirit he speaks mysteries.">1 Corinthians 14:2</a> of this Epistle, in <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-7.htm" title="For the mystery of iniquity does already work: only he who now lets will let, until he be taken out of the way.">2 Thessalonians 2:7</a>, and in <a href="/revelation/1-20.htm" title="The mystery of the seven stars which you saw in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks which you saw are the seven churches.">Revelation 1:20</a>. The latter sense is met with in <a href="/romans/16-25.htm" title="Now to him that is of power to establish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began,">Romans 16:25</a>; <a href="/ephesians/3-9.htm" title="And to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world has been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ:">Ephesians 3:9</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-26.htm" title=" Even the mystery which has been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints:">Colossians 1:26</a>, &c. The present passage appears to include both meanings. The ministers of Christ are to nourish their people on the knowledge of the truths of His Gospel, a knowledge (ch. <a href="/context/1_corinthians/2-10.htm" title="But God has revealed them to us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searches all things, yes, the deep things of God....">1 Corinthians 2:10-16</a>) revealed only to the spiritual. No instance of the word in its more modern Greek sense of <span class="ital">Sacraments</span> is to be found in Holy Scripture. In the Septuagint it is frequently found in the Apocrypha (as in <a href="//apocrypha.org/tobit/12-7.htm" title="It is good to keep close the secret of a king, but it is honourable to reveal the works of God. Do that which is good, and no evil shall touch you.">Tob 12:7</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/tobit/12-11.htm" title="Surely I will keep close nothing from you. For I said, It was good to keep close the secret of a king, but that it was honourable to reveal the works of God.">Tob 12:11</a>), but the only instances of its occurrence in the Canonical books are in the Septuagint translation of the book of Daniel, ch. <a href="/context/daniel/2-18.htm" title="That they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon....">Daniel 2:18-19</a>; <a href="/context/daniel/2-27.htm" title="Daniel answered in the presence of the king, and said, The secret which the king has demanded cannot the wise men, the astrologers, the magicians, the soothsayers, show to the king;...">Daniel 2:27-30</a>; <a href="/daniel/2-47.htm" title="The king answered to Daniel, and said, Of a truth it is, that your God is a God of gods, and a Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, seeing you could reveal this secret.">Daniel 2:47</a>, ch. <a href="/1_corinthians/4-9.htm" title="For I think that God has set forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle to the world, and to angels, and to men.">1 Corinthians 4:9</a> (where it is the translation of a Chaldaic word signifying “a thing hidden,” which in our Authorized Version is translated <span class="ital">secret</span>) and in <a href="/isaiah/24-16.htm" title="From the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs, even glory to the righteous.
