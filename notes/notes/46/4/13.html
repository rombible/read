Perhaps the word is used here by the Apostle to include that idea in the sufferings, the description of which here reaches a climax. It is not only that we are the filth and off scouring of all men, but we are so for the sake of others.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:7-13 We have no reason to be proud; all we have, or are, or do, that is good, is owing to the free and rich grace of God. A sinner snatched from destruction by sovereign grace alone, must be very absurd and inconsistent, if proud of the free gifts of God. St. Paul sets forth his own circumstances, ver. 9. Allusion is made to the cruel spectacles in the Roman games; where men were forced to cut one another to pieces, to divert the people; and where the victor did not escape with his life, though he should destroy his adversary, but was only kept for another combat, and must be killed at last. The thought that many eyes are upon believers, when struggling with difficulties or temptations, should encourage constancy and patience. We are weak, but ye are strong. All Christians are not alike exposed. Some suffer greater hardships than others. The apostle enters into particulars of their sufferings. And how glorious the charity and devotion that carried them through all these hardships! They suffered in their persons and characters as the worst and vilest of men; as the very dirt of the world, that was to be swept away: nay, as the offscouring of all things, the dross of all things. And every one who would be faithful in Christ Jesus, must be prepared for poverty and contempt. Whatever the disciples of Christ suffer from men, they must follow the example, and fulfil the will and precepts of their Lord. They must be content, with him and for him, to be despised and abused. It is much better to be rejected, despised, and ill used, as St. Paul was, than to have the good opinion and favour of the world. Though cast off by the world as vile, yet we may be precious to God, gathered up with his own hand, and placed upon his throne.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Being defamed - Greek, Blasphemed, that is, spoken of and to, in a harsh, abusive, and reproachful manner. The original and proper meaning of the word is to speak in a reproachful manner of anyone, whether of God or man. It is usually applied to God, but it may also be used of people.<p>We entreat - Either God in their behalf, praying him to forgive them, or we entreat them to turn from their sins, and become converted to God. Probably the latter is the sense. They besought them to examine more candidly their claims instead of reviling them; and to save their souls by embracing the gospel instead of destroying them by rejecting it with contempt and scorn.<p>We are made - We became; we are so regarded or esteemed. The word here does not imply that there was any positive agency in making them such, but simply that they were in fact so regarded.<p>As the filth of the earth - It would not be possible to employ stronger expressions to denote the contempt and scorn with which they were everywhere regarded. The word "filth" &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;  perikatharmata occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. It properly denotes filth, or that which is collected by sweeping a house, or that which is collected and cast away by purifying or cleansing anything; hence, any vile, worthless, and contemptible object. Among the Greeks the word was used to denote the victims which were offered to expiate crimes, and particularly men of ignoble rank, and of a worthless and wicked character, who were kept to be offered to the gods in a time of pestilence, to appease their anger, and to purify the nation. Bretschneider and Schleusner. Hence, it was applied by them to people of the most vile, abject, and worthless character. But it is not certain that Paul had any reference to that sense of the word. The whole force of the expression may be met by the supposition that he uses it in the sense of that filth or dirt which is collected by the process of cleansing or scouring anything, as being vile, contemptible, worthless. So the apostles were regarded. And by the use of the word "world" here, he meant to say that they were regarded as the most vile and worthless men which the whole world could furnish; not only the refuse of Judea, but of all the nations of the earth. As if he had said "more vile and worthless people could not be found on the face of the earth."<p>And are the off-scouring of all things - This word (&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c8;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;  peripse&#772;ma) occurs no where else in the New Testament. It does not differ materially from the word rendered "filth." It denotes that which is rubbed off by scouring or cleaning anything; and hence, anything vile or worthless; or a vile and worthless man. This term was also applied to vile and worthless people who were sacrificed or thrown into the sea as an expiatory offering, as it were to purify the people. Suidas remarks that; they said to such a man, "be then our &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c8;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;  peripse&#772;ma," our redemption, and then flung him into the sea as a sacrifice to Neptune.

Suidas in his Lexicon states that it was a custom among the Greeks in times of calamity to cast a victim into the sea as a sacrifice to appease Poseidon, the god of the sea, with the words, “Be thou our offscouring.” In virtue of the humiliations and distresses endured by St Paul, he represents himself as becoming the refuse of mankind, in order that by this means he may bring blessings innumerable within their reach.

It may mean "we entreat men not to speak thus injuriously of us" (Calvin); or "we exhort them to do right." <span class="cmt_word">As the filth of the world</span>. The Greek word <span class="accented">katharmata</span> has a technical sense, in which it means "men devoted to death for purposes of expiation" (<span class="accented">homines piaculares</span>). The word <span class="accented">perikatharnmta</span> has the sense of "sin offerings" in <a href="/proverbs/21-18.htm">Proverbs 21:18</a>; Tobit 5:18. It is, however, doubtful whether this meaning of the word could have been at all familiar to Greek readers, and it is only in a very general and distantly metaphorical sense that the sufferings of God's saints can be regarded as, in any sense of the word, vicarious. It is better, therefore, here to retain the sense of "refuse" (<span class="accented">purgamenta</span>, things vile and worthless). <span class="cmt_word">The offscouring of all things;</span> perhaps rather, <span class="accented">of</span> <span class="accented">all men.</span> The word <span class="accented">peripsema</span> means "a thing scraped off," and this word also was used in expiatory human sacrifices, where the formula used to victims thus flung into the sea, in times of plague or famine, was, "Become our <span class="accented">peripsema'</span> ('Schol. on Ar.;' Plut., 456). Thus in Tobit (5:18), Anna the wife of Tobias says, "Let the money be used as a <span class="accented">peripsema</span> for the child;" and Ignatius uses the phrase, "I am your <span class="accented">peripsema."</span> From this and the similar phrase in the Letter of Barnabas," I am the <span class="accented">peripsema</span> of your love," it seems to have become a current expression of tenderness among Christians, "I am your <span class="accented">peripsema."</span> But in this case also it may be doubted whether the sacrificial idea was present in the apostle's mind. He is thinking of scenes which he had already faced and would have to face hereafter, when mobs shouted against him that he was "a pestilent fellow" (<a href="/acts/24-5.htm">Acts 24:5</a>) and not fit to live (<a href="/acts/22-22.htm">Acts 22:22</a>). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/1_corinthians/4.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Defamed (&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;)<p>Publicly slandered; while reviled refers to personal abuse.<p>Intreat (&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;)<p>See on consolation, <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/6-24.htm">Luke 6:24</a>, and see on comfort, <a href="/acts/9-31.htm">Acts 9:31</a>.

Hence that which is thrown off in cleansing; refuse. &#x39a;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; the refuse of a sacrifice. So Aeschylus. Electra says: "Should I, like one who has carried away refuse (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;) from a purification, after tossing away the urn, go back again with unturned eyes?" ("Choephoroe," 90). In <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/21-18.htm">Proverbs 21:18</a>, Sept., it occurs in the sense of ransom. Some find an allusion here to an ancient Athenian custom of throwing certain worthless persons into the sea in case of plague or famine, saying Be our offscouring! These persons were called &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; offscourings, or &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; scrapings, in the belief that they would wipe away the nation's guilt. Ignatius says to the Ephesians, &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c8;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; I am your offscouring. The sense is twofold: I am as the meanest among you; and I devote my life for you. In the middle of the third century, &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c8;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; had become a common expression of formal compliment: your humble servant. See Lightfoot, "Apostolic Fathers," on Ignatius to the Ephesians, 8. "Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/3-45.htm">Lamentations 3:45</a>, and Tobit 5:18. &#x3a0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c8;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; that which is scraped or scoured off. Both words only here in the New Testament.<p>This tremendous piece of irony justifies the numerous allusions which have been made to Paul's vehemence and severity. Thus Dante, in his vision of the Earthly Paradise, pictures Paul:<p>"Two old men I beheld, unlike in habit,<p>But like in gait, each dignified and grave.<p>One (Luke) showed himself as one of the disciples<p>Of that supreme Hippocrates whom Nature<p>Made for the animals she holds most dear,<p>Contrary care the other (Paul) manifested,<p>With sword so shining and so sharp, it caused<p>continued...</body></html>
