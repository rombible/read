Or the apostle may be considered in this verse as repeating ironically the things which his enemies in Corinth said of him, and as attributing to them, in the same spirit of irony, the contrary qualities. <span class="ital">Even unto this present hour </span>— Not only at our first entrance upon our office, when all the world was set against Christianity, but still, though many thousands are converted; <span class="ital">we both hunger and thirst, </span>&c. — Are destitute of necessary food and apparel, and exposed to wants of all sorts. Who can imagine a more glorious triumph of the truth than that which is gained in these circumstances? When Paul, with an impediment in his speech, and a person rather contemptible than graceful, appeared in a mean, perhaps tattered dress, before persons of the highest distinction, and yet commanded such attention, and made such deep impressions upon them! <span class="ital">Being reviled, we bless, suffer it, entreat </span>— We do not return revilings, persecution, defamation; nothing but blessing, <span class="ital">We are made as the filth of the world, and the off-scouring of all things </span>— Such were those poor wretches among the heathen, who were taken from the dregs of the people to be offered as expiatory sacrifices to the infernal gods.

And when the ashes of those unhappy men were thrown into the sea, those very names were given them in the ceremony.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:7-13 We have no reason to be proud; all we have, or are, or do, that is good, is owing to the free and rich grace of God. A sinner snatched from destruction by sovereign grace alone, must be very absurd and inconsistent, if proud of the free gifts of God. St. Paul sets forth his own circumstances, ver. 9. Allusion is made to the cruel spectacles in the Roman games; where men were forced to cut one another to pieces, to divert the people; and where the victor did not escape with his life, though he should destroy his adversary, but was only kept for another combat, and must be killed at last. The thought that many eyes are upon believers, when struggling with difficulties or temptations, should encourage constancy and patience. We are weak, but ye are strong. All Christians are not alike exposed. Some suffer greater hardships than others. The apostle enters into particulars of their sufferings. And how glorious the charity and devotion that carried them through all these hardships! They suffered in their persons and characters as the worst and vilest of men; as the very dirt of the world, that was to be swept away: nay, as the offscouring of all things, the dross of all things. And every one who would be faithful in Christ Jesus, must be prepared for poverty and contempt. Whatever the disciples of Christ suffer from men, they must follow the example, and fulfil the will and precepts of their Lord. They must be content, with him and for him, to be despised and abused. It is much better to be rejected, despised, and ill used, as St. Paul was, than to have the good opinion and favour of the world. Though cast off by the world as vile, yet we may be precious to God, gathered up with his own hand, and placed upon his throne.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>We are fools - This is evidently ironical. "We are doubtless foolish people, but ye are wise in Christ. We, Paul, Apollos, and Barnabas, have no claims to the character of wise men - we are to be regarded as fools, unworthy of confidence, and unfit to instruct; but you are full of wisdom."<p>For Christ's sake - &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3a7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd;  dia Christon. On account of Christ; or in reference to his cause, or in regard to the doctrines of the Christian religion.<p>But ye are wise in Christ - The phrase "in Christ," does not differ in signification materially from the one above; "for Christ's sake." This is wholly ironical, and is exceedingly pungent. "You, Corinthians, boast of your wisdom and prudence. You are to be esteemed very wise. You are unwilling to submit to be esteemed fools. You are proud of your attainments. We, in the meantime, who are apostles, and who have founded your church, are to be regarded as fools, and as unworthy of public confidence and esteem." The whole design of this irony is to show the folly of their boasted wisdom. That they only should be wise and prudent, and the apostles fools, was in the highest degree absurd; and this absurdity the apostle puts in a strong light by his irony.<p>We are weak - We are timid and feeble, but you are daring, bold and fearless. This is irony. The very reverse was probably true. Paul was bold, daring, fearless in declaring the truth, whatever opposition it might encounter; and probably many of them were timid and time-serving, and endeavoring to avoid persecution, and to accommodate themselves to the prejudices and opinions of those who were wise in their own sight; the prejudices and opinions of the world.<p>Ye are honourable - Deserving of honor and obtaining it. Still ironical. You are to be esteemed as worthy of praise.<p>We are despised - &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;  atimoi. Not only actually contemned, but worthy to be so. This was irony also. And the design was to show them how foolish was their self-confidence and self-flattery, and their attempt to exalt themselves. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10.

They deem themselves “strong” in contrast with the “feeble in faith” (<a href="/romans/14-1.htm" title="Him that is weak in the faith receive you, but not to doubtful disputations.">Romans 14:1</a>), with whom P. associates himself (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-22.htm" title="To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some.">1 Corinthians 9:22</a>, etc.), able to “use the world” (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-31.htm" title="And they that use this world, as not abusing it: for the fashion of this world passes away.">1 Corinthians 7:31</a>) and not hampered by weak-minded scruples (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-12.htm" title="All things are lawful to me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.">1 Corinthians 6:12</a>, <a href="/1_corinthians/10-23.htm" title="All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but all things edify not.">1 Corinthians 10:23</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/10-8.htm" title="Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand.">1 Corinthians 10:8</a>; see note on <a href="/1_corinthians/3-22.htm" title="Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours;">1 Corinthians 3:22</a>). In the third clause P. reverses the order of prons. (<span class="ital">you … we</span>), returning to the description of his own mode of life.

It is scarcely necessary to explain that this language is ironical. They were unquestionably ‘prudent’ in this, that they spared themselves the labours and anxieties in which St Paul was so ‘abundant’ (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-23.htm" title="Are they ministers of Christ?

Without any violation of the truth, different things may be predicated of one subject; or of different subjects, who are regarded as standing on the same footing; for example, of Paul and the Corinthians; according to the different point of view in which they are regarded, and which the words, <span class="ital">for the sake of</span>, and, <span class="ital">in</span>, here express; <span class="ital">for the sake of</span> is applied to slaves; <span class="ital">in</span>, to partners.—<span class="greekheb">ἔνδοξοι</span>) men in the highest estimation; but <span class="greekheb">ἄτιμοι</span>, applies to persons, who are deprived of even ordinary esteem.—<span class="greekheb">ἡμεῖς δὲ</span>, <span class="ital">but we</span>) Here the first person takes the second place, and so it goes on in the following verse.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">We are fools for Christ's sake.</span> The irony is softened by the intervening sentences, and as regards the apostles there is no irony.
