The emphasis is on the word “now.” Ye are already (as distinct from us Apostles) full, rich, kings. You act as if you had already attained the crowning point in the Christian course. “Piety is an insatiable thing,” says Chrysostom on this passage, “and it argues a childish mind to imagine from just the beginnings that you have attained the whole; and for men who are not even yet in the prelude of a matter to be highminded, as if they had laid hold of the end.”<p><span class= "bld">Without us.</span>—The Apostle would have his converts be to him as his crown of rejoicing; but they now assume to have “come into the kingdom” without any connection with him who had won them to God.<p><span class= "bld">And I would to</span> <span class= "bld">God.</span>—Here the irony is dropped, and these words are written with intense feeling and humility. The Apostle, reminded, as it were, by the word “reign,” that the time will come when the war and controversies of the Church militant shall end, expresses his deep longing for that blessed change. (See <a href="/1_corinthians/3-22.htm" title="Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours;">1Corinthians 3:22</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/9-23.htm" title="And this I do for the gospel's sake, that I might be partaker thereof with you.">1Corinthians 9:23</a>, where similarly the Apostle shows that in rebuking the folly of the Corinthian Church he does not under-estimate their privileges.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_corinthians/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/1_corinthians/4-8.htm" title="Now you are full, now you are rich, you have reigned as kings without us: and I would to God you did reign, that we also might reign with you.">1 Corinthians 4:8</a></span>. <span class="ital">Now ye are full </span>— The Corinthians abounded with spiritual gifts; and so did the apostles. But the apostles, by continual want and sufferings, were preserved from self-complacency. The Corinthians suffered nothing; and having plenty of all things, were pleased with and applauded themselves. And they were like children who, being raised in the world, disregard their poor parents. <span class="ital">Now ye are full, </span>says the apostle, in a beautiful gradation; <span class="ital">ye are rich; ye have reigned as kings </span>— A proverbial expression, denoting the most splendid and plentiful circumstances; <span class="ital">without us </span>— That is, without any thought of us; or, by the ministry of your own teachers, without our help. <span class="ital">And I would to God ye did reign </span>— In the best sense: I would ye had attained to an eminence of grace and holiness as well as of gifts; <span class="ital">that we also might reign with you </span>— Might have no more sorrow on your account. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:7-13 We have no reason to be proud; all we have, or are, or do, that is good, is owing to the free and rich grace of God. A sinner snatched from destruction by sovereign grace alone, must be very absurd and inconsistent, if proud of the free gifts of God. St. Paul sets forth his own circumstances, ver. 9. Allusion is made to the cruel spectacles in the Roman games; where men were forced to cut one another to pieces, to divert the people; and where the victor did not escape with his life, though he should destroy his adversary, but was only kept for another combat, and must be killed at last. The thought that many eyes are upon believers, when struggling with difficulties or temptations, should encourage constancy and patience. We are weak, but ye are strong. All Christians are not alike exposed. Some suffer greater hardships than others. The apostle enters into particulars of their sufferings. And how glorious the charity and devotion that carried them through all these hardships! They suffered in their persons and characters as the worst and vilest of men; as the very dirt of the world, that was to be swept away: nay, as the offscouring of all things, the dross of all things. And every one who would be faithful in Christ Jesus, must be prepared for poverty and contempt. Whatever the disciples of Christ suffer from men, they must follow the example, and fulfil the will and precepts of their Lord. They must be content, with him and for him, to be despised and abused. It is much better to be rejected, despised, and ill used, as St. Paul was, than to have the good opinion and favour of the world. Though cast off by the world as vile, yet we may be precious to God, gathered up with his own hand, and placed upon his throne.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Now ye are full - It is generally agreed that this is spoken in irony, and that it is an indignant sarcasm uttered against the false and self-confident teachers in Corinth. The design is to contrast them with the apostles; to show how self-confident and vain the false teachers were, and how laborious and self-denying the apostles were; and to show to them how little claim they had to authority in the church, and the real claim which the apostles had from their self-denials and labors. The whole passage is an instance of most pungent and cutting sarcasm, and shows that there may be occasions when irony may be proper, though it should be rare. An instance of cutting irony occurs also in regard to the priests of Baal, in <a href="/1_kings/18-27.htm">1 Kings 18:27</a>. The word translated "ye are full" (&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;  kekoresmenoi) occurs only here, and in <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/27-38.htm">Acts 27:38</a>, "And when they had eaten enough." It is usually applied to a feast, and denotes those who are satiated or satisfied. So here it means, "You think' you have enough. You are satisfied with your conviction of your own knowledge, and do not feel your need of anything more."<p>Ye are rich - This is presenting the same idea in a different form. "You esteem yourselves to be rich in spiritual gifts, and graces, so that you do not feel the necessity of any more."<p>Ye have reigned as kings - This is simply carrying forward the idea before stated; but in the form of a climax. The first metaphor is taken from persons "filled with food;" the second from those who are so rich that they do not feel their lack of more; the third from those who are raised to a throne, the highest elevation, where there was nothing further to be reached or desired. And the phrase means, that they had been fully satisfied with their condition and attainments, with their knowledge and power, that they lived like rich men and princes - revelling, as it were, on spiritual enjoyments, and disdaining all foreign influence, and instruction, and control.<p>Without us - Without our counsel and instruction. You have taken the whole management of matters on yourselves without any regard to our advice or authority. You did not feel your need of our aid; and you did not regard our authority. You supposed you could get along as well without us as with us.<p>And I would to God ye did reign - Many interpreters have understood this as if Paul had really expressed a wish that they were literal princes, that they might afford protection to him in his persecution and troubles. Thus, Grotius, Whitby, Locke, Rosemuller, and Doddridge. But the more probable interpretation is, that Paul here drops the irony, and addresses them in a sober, earnest manner. It is the expression of a wish that they were as truly happy and blessed as they thought themselves to be. "I wish that you were so abundant in all spiritual improvements; I wish that you had made such advances that you could be represented as full, and as rich, and as princes, needing nothing, that when I came I might have nothing to do but to partake of your joy." So Calvin, Lightfoot, Bloomfield. It implies:<p>(1) A wish that they were truly happy and blessed;<p>(2) A doubt implied whether they were then so; and,<p>(3) A desire on the part of Paul to partake of their real and true joy, instead of being compelled to come to them with the language of rebuke and admonition; see <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-19.htm">1 Corinthians 4:19</a>, <a href="/1_corinthians/4-21.htm">1 Corinthians 4:21</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. Irony. Translate, "Already ye are filled full (with spiritual food), already ye are rich, ye have seated yourselves upon your throne as kings, without us." The emphasis is on "already" and "without us"; ye act as if ye needed no more to "hunger and thirst after righteousness," and as if already ye had reached the "kingdom" for which Christians have to strive and suffer. Ye are so puffed up with your favorite teachers, and your own fancied spiritual attainments in knowledge through them, that ye feel like those "filled full" at a feast, or as a "rich" man priding himself in his riches: so ye feel ye can now do "without us," your first spiritual fathers (1Co 4:15). They forgot that before the "kingdom" and the "fulness of joy," at the marriage feast of the Lamb, must come the cross, and suffering, to every true believer (2Ti 2:5, 11, 12). They were like the self-complacent Laodiceans (Re 3:17; compare Ho 12:8). Temporal fulness and riches doubtless tended in some cases at Corinth, to generate this spiritual self-sufficiency; the contrast to the apostle's literal "hunger and thirst" (1Co 4:11) proves this.<p>I would &#8230; ye did reign&#8212;Translate, "I would indeed," &c. I would truly it were so, and that your kingdom had really begun.<p>that we also might reign with you&#8212;(2Co 12:14). "I seek not yours, but you." Your spiritual prosperity would redound to that of us, your fathers in Christ (1Co 9:23). When you reach the kingdom, you shall be our "crown of rejoicing, in the presence of our Lord Jesus" (1Th 2:19).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_corinthians/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Now ye are full, now ye are rich; </span> you that are the teachers at Corinth, or you that are the members of the church there, think yourselves full of knowledge and wisdom, so as you stand in need of no further learning or instruction. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Ye have reigned as kings without us; </span> ye think now you have got a kingdom, and are arrived at the top of felicity. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And I would to God ye did reign, that we also might reign with you; </span> I am so far from envying you, that I wish it were so, and we might have a share with you. The apostle speaketh this ironically, not that he indeed thought they were so, but reflecting on their vain and too good an opinion of themselves. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_corinthians/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Now ye are full,.... That is, in their own opinion: these words, and some following expressions, are an ironical concession. They were not full of God, and divine things; nor of Christ, and of grace out of his fulness; nor of the Holy Ghost, and of faith, as Stephen and Barnabas are said to be; nor of joy and peace in believing; nor of goodness and spiritual knowledge; but they were full of themselves, and were pulled up in their fleshly minds with an opinion of their abilities, learning, oratory, and eloquence, of their ministers, and of their own great improvements in knowledge under their ministrations. They fancied they had got to a perfection in knowledge and were brimful of it; and as the full stomach, from which the metaphor is taken, loathes the honeycomb, so these persons loathed the apostle's ministry, and the pure preaching of the Gospel; imagining that they had attained to something above it, and stood in no need of it; when, alas! they were but babes, children in understanding, and needed milk instead of strong meat; so far were they from being what they thought themselves to be. <p>Now ye are rich; not in faith; nor in good works; nor in spiritual gifts and knowledge, though some among them were; but that is not here intended: the meaning is, they were rich, and abounded in knowledge in their own account. Like the Laodiceans, they conceited themselves to be rich, and increased with goods, when they were poor, and wretched, and miserable. <p>Ye have reigned as kings without us. The saints, in the best sense, are kings, made so by Christ; and have not only the name, and the ensigns of royalty, as crowns and thrones prepared for them, but kingdoms also: they have a kingdom of grace, which they enjoy now, and shall never be removed; in which they reign as kings under the influence of the Spirit of God, over the corruptions of their own hearts, which are laid under the restraints of mighty grace; and over the world, which they have under the feet; and over Satan, who is dethroned and cast out of them; and they shall inherit the kingdom of glory hereafter; but nothing of this kind is here intended. The sense of the words is, that these persons imagined that they had arrived to such a pitch of knowledge, as to be independent of the apostles; needed no instructions and directions from them, and were in great tranquillity and ease of mind, and attended with outward prosperity, so that they lived, as kings, the most happy life that could be desired; upon which the apostle expresses his hearty wish for them: <p>and I would to God ye did reign; not in carnal security, and in affluence of worldly enjoyments, which the apostle was not desirous of for himself, and other his fellow ministers; nor in a spiritual sense, merely as believers in common, and as he then did; but with Christ in his kingdom state here on earth: <p>that we also might reign with you; for all the saints will be together when Christ takes to himself his great power, and reigns; they will all reign with him on earth a thousand years; this is a faithful saying, nothing more true, or to be depended on, that those that suffer with him shall also reign with him; and not a part of his people only, but the whole body: hence the apostle wishes, that this reigning time for the church of Christ was come, then he and the rest of the apostles would reign also: but, alas! it was a plain case, from the condition they were in, of which the following words give a narrative, that this time was not yet. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_corinthians/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{9}</span> Now ye are full, now ye are rich, ye have reigned as kings without us: and I would to God ye did reign, that we also might reign with you.</span><p>(9) He descends to a most grave mockery, to cause those glory-seeking men to blush, even though they did not want to.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/1_corinthians/4.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/1_corinthians/4-8.htm" title="Now you are full, now you are rich, you have reigned as kings without us: and I would to God you did reign, that we also might reign with you.">1 Corinthians 4:8</a>.

The transition, too, from the individualizing singular to the <span class="ital">plural</span> corresponds to the rising emotion. The <span class="ital">interrogative</span> way of taking the passage (Baumgarten) weakens it without reason; for the disapproval of such bitter derision (Stolz, Rückert) is, in the first place, over-hasty, since Paul could not but know best how he had to chastise the Corinthians; and, in the second, it fails to recognise the fact, that he, just in consequence of the purity of his conscience, could give rein to the indignant temper amply warranted in him by the actual position of things, without justifying the suspicion of self-seeking and thirst for power (this in opposition to Rückert).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In <span class="greekheb">κεκορ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐστέ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἐπλουτ</span>., and <span class="greekheb">ἐβασιλ</span>., we have a vehement climax: <span class="ital">Already sated are ye, already become rich are ye; without our help ye have attained to dominion</span>! The sarcastic force of this address, which shows the repulsive shape in which the inflated character and demeanour of the Corinthians presented itself, is intensified by the emphatically prefixed <span class="greekheb">ἤδη</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἤδη</span> and <span class="greekheb">χωρὶς ἡμῶν</span>: “<span class="ital">already</span> ye have, what was only expected in the coming <span class="greekheb">αἰών</span>, fulness of satisfaction and of enrichment in Messianic blessings; <span class="ital">without our help</span> (mine and that of Apollos, <a href="/1_corinthians/4-6.htm" title="And these things, brothers, I have in a figure transferred to myself and to Apollos for your sakes; that you might learn in us not to think of men above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against another.">1 Corinthians 4:6</a>) are ye arrived at the highest stage of Messianic power and glory, at the <span class="greekheb">βασιλεία</span>!” You have already reached such a pitch of Christian perfection, are become without us such mightily exalted and dominant personages, that there is presented in you an anticipation of the future Messianic satisfaction, of the Messianic fulness of possession and dominion. <span class="ital">Ordinarily</span>, <span class="greekheb">κεκορ</span>. and <span class="greekheb">ἐπλουτ</span>.

But all these interpretations fail to do justice to the <span class="ital">sarcastic method of expression</span>, although they <span class="ital">in part</span> correctly enough describe the <span class="ital">state of the case</span>, which is here ironically presented. The right view may be seen in Hofmann also. In connection with the <span class="greekheb">ἐβασιλ</span>. left without being more precisely defined, nothing came so naturally and at once to the Christian consciousness as the thought of the <span class="ital">Messianic</span> <span class="greekheb">βασιλεία</span>.[653] And how well this idea corresponds to the wish which follows! If, however, <span class="greekheb">ἐβασ</span>. applies to the <span class="ital">Messianic</span> ruling (see on <a href="/1_corinthians/3-22.htm" title="Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours;">1 Corinthians 3:22</a>; Usteri, <span class="ital">Lehrbegriff</span>, p. 370), and consequently to the <span class="greekheb">συμβασιλεύειν</span> of <a href="/2_timothy/2-12.htm" title="If we suffer, we shall also reign with him: if we deny him, he also will deny us:">2 Timothy 2:12</a>, comp <a href="/romans/8-17.htm" title="And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.">Romans 8:17</a>, then in that case <span class="greekheb">κεκορ</span>. and <span class="greekheb">ἐπλουτ</span>. also, to preserve the symmetry of this ironical picture, must be understood in the sense of the Messianic consummation of all things, and must denote the being full and rich <span class="greekheb">κατʼ ἐξοχήν</span> (namely, in the blessings of the Messianic salvation), which for the Christian consciousness did not need to be particularly specified.

Contrast between the Corinthian Teachers and St Paul<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">8</span>. <span class="ital">Now ye are full, now ye are rich</span>] Here we have one of the sudden turns of feeling so remarkable in the Apostle’s style. Abruptly breaking off at the word ‘boast,’ he dashes off into an animated and ironical apostrophe. ‘I may well say ‘boast’ for boasting is your crying sin, but it is boasting in yourselves, not in God. All your wants spiritual and temporal now are satisfied, you have become rich, you are reigning like kings. But in your self-satisfaction you give not a thought to those whose labours have made you what you are. Would that it were really with you as you imagine it to be! Then we might hope for some remission of our trials, distresses, humiliations. But at present all the sorrow, suffering, shame is ours, while either in fact or in fancy you are enjoying all the good things given to Christians, immunity from suffering, quiet of conscience (<a href="/romans/8-1.htm" title="There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.">Romans 8:1</a>), wisdom, honour, inward satisfaction.’ The word translated <span class="ital">full</span> has the sense of being satiated with good things, (Vulgate, <span class="ital">saturati</span>). Some editors read the verse as a series of questions. But the affirmative form strengthens the irony of the passage.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">without us</span>] Though St Paul had admitted the Corinthians into the same blessings as he enjoyed himself, he had no share in <span class="ital">their</span> blessings.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and I would to God ye did reign, that we also might reign with you</span>] The Apostle does not regard the persecutions and distresses he underwent as desirable for their own sake, but only as means to an end. The empire of evil is not to be destroyed without a conflict, and the sufferings endured by Christ’s servants are the evidences that it is going on. But the best of those who are thus contending for the truth may lawfully wish that the conflict were over and the reign of the saints begun. Such a wish, in fact, appears to be expressed by the words, ‘Thy kingdom come.’<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/1_corinthians/4.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/1_corinthians/4-8.htm" title="Now you are full, now you are rich, you have reigned as kings without us: and I would to God you did reign, that we also might reign with you.">1 Corinthians 4:8</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἤδη</span>, <span class="ital">now</span>), in comparison with us.

As the two epistles to the Corinthians exhibit great variety in mental feeling [<span class="greekheb">ἦθος</span>, Append.], incomparable urbanity [asteismus, Append.], and abundant and playful acuteness, so the passage before us is to such a degree remarkable for these qualities, that it should be understood, in respect either of the Corinthians or of the apostles, concerning their internal or external condition, concerning the facts themselves or concerning the puffed-up opinion of the Corinthians. The spiritual condition of the Corinthians was truly flourishing—flourishing also was that of the apostles. This was right: but troubles [the cross] from without galled the apostles and prevented them from pleasing themselves on that account: the Corinthians, inasmuch as being in a flourishing state even in things external, were pleased with and were applauding themselves, which was wrong. Therefore, the Corinthians were imitating the conduct of sons, who, after they have become illustrious, care little for their humble parents: in consequence of fulness, they were fastidious; of opulence, they were insolent; of kingly power, they were proud.—<span class="greekheb">χωρὶς ἡμῶν</span>, <span class="ital">without us</span>) A new and apt ambiguity; you have not us as your partners; consequently you have not had us as your assistants; you have forgotten us, as the saying expresses it, “many pupils become superior to their teachers,” <span class="greekheb">πολλοὶ μαθηταὶ κρείττονες διδασκάλων</span>.—<span class="greekheb">ἐβασιλεύσατε</span>, <span class="ital">ye have reigned</span>) ye have come to your kingdom.

The loving delicate irony is, in a different way, as effective as the stern denunciation of St. John: "Thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked" (<a href="/revelation/3-17.htm">Revelation 3:17</a>). St. Paul's satire is always akin to charity; it is never satire with no pity in it. <span class="cmt_word">Ye have reigned as kings</span>. The word simply means "ye reigned." Like the Stoics, so each little Corinthian sectarian regarded himself as a king. "To reign" was, however, a proverbial phrase (like the Latin <span class="accented">vivo et regno</span>) for being "happy as a king." <span class="cmt_word">Without us</span> (comp. <a href="/hebrews/11-40.htm">Hebrews 11:40</a>). The Corinthians were cultivated enough to appreciate the deep irony of the phrase, "We poor apostles have become quite needless to you in your lordly independence." <span class="cmt_word">And I would to God ye did reign</span>. The words "to God" should be omitted. The loving heart of St. Paul could never long keep up a strain of irony. He drops the satire, and passes on to impassioned and affectionate appeal. <span class="cmt_word">That we also might reign with you.</span> If the exalted eminence which you now only enjoy in your own conceits had been but real, then we, whose "hope, and joy, and crown of exultation you are in the presence of Christ" (<a href="/1_thessalonians/2-19.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:19</a>), should share the grandeur with you. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/1_corinthians/4.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Now ye are full (&#x3b7;&#787;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b7; &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;)<p>Rev., better, filled.
