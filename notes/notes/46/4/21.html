I am coming to you as a father in any case. But shall I come as a father comes with a rod (<a href="/isaiah/11-4.htm" title="But with righteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth: and he shall smite the earth: with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked.">Isaiah 11:4</a>), and going to inflict punishment with it (such is the force of the Greek, “<span class= "ital">in</span> a rod”); or as a father would come when no faults on the child’s part need interfere with the perfect and unrestricted outflowing of his gentleness and love. The pathos of these last few words sufficiently indicate what the Apostle would himself prefer. The choice, however, rested with them. His love would be no love, if without any change on their part, it led him to show no displeasure where correction was for their sake absolutely needed. This is a great and striking example of St. Paul having the “mind of God.” He treats the Corinthians as God ever treats His children.<p>This verse at once concludes this first part of the Epistle, in which the party-spirit and the evils resulting from it in Corinth are treated of, and naturally introduces the second topic to be discussed, viz., the case of incest which had occurred, it being one of the things which would compel the Apostle to visit Corinth, not “in love and in the spirit of meekness,” but “with a rod.”<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:14-21 In reproving for sin, we should distinguish between sinners and their sins. Reproofs that kindly and affectionately warn, are likely to reform. Though the apostle spoke with authority as a parent, he would rather beseech them in love. And as ministers are to set an example, others must follow them, as far as they follow Christ in faith and practice. Christians may mistake and differ in their views, but Christ and Christian truth are the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever. Whenever the gospel is effectual, it comes not in word only, but also in power, by the Holy Spirit, quickening dead sinners, delivering persons from the slavery of sin and Satan, renewing them both inwardly and outwardly, and comforting, strengthening, and establishing the saints, which cannot be done by the persuasive language of men, but by the power of God. And it is a happy temper, to have the spirit of love and meekness bear the rule, yet to maintain just authority.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>What will ye - It depends on yourselves how I shall come. If you lay aside your contentions and strifes; if you administer discipline as you should; if you give yourselves heartily and entirely to the work of the Lord, I shall come, not to reprove or to punish, but as a father and a friend. But if you do not heed my exhortations or the labors of Timothy; if you still continue your contentions, and do not remove the occasions of offence, I shall come with severity and the language of rebuke.<p>With a rod - To correct and punish.<p>In the spirit of meekness - Comforting and commending instead of chastising. Paul intimates that this depended on themselves. They had the power, and it was their duty to administer discipline; but if they would not do it, the task would devolve on him as the founder and father of the church, and as entrusted with power by the Lord Jesus to administer the severity of Christian discipline, or to punish those who offended by bodily suffering; see <a href="/1_corinthians/5-5.htm">1 Corinthians 5:5</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/11-30.htm">1 Corinthians 11:30</a>. See also the case of Ananias and Sapphira (<a href="/acts/5-1.htm">Acts 5:1</a> ff), and of Elymas the sorcerer. <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/13-10.htm">Acts 13:10-11</a>.<p>Remarks On <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4.htm">1 Corinthians 4</a><p>1. We should endeavor to form a proper estimate of the Christian ministry; <a href="/1_corinthians/4-1.htm">1 Corinthians 4:1</a>. We should regard ministers as the servants of Jesus Christ, and honor them for their Master's sake; and esteem them also in proportion to their fidelity. They are entitled to respect as the ambassadors of the Son of God; but that respect also should be in proportion to their resemblance of him and their faithfulness in their work. They who love the ministers of Christ, who are like him, and who are faithful, love the Master that sent them; they who hate and despise them despise him; see <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/10-40.htm">Matthew 10:40-42</a>.<p>2. Ministers should be faithful; <a href="/1_corinthians/4-2.htm">1 Corinthians 4:2</a>. They are the stewards of Christ. They are appointed by him. They are responsible to him. They have a most important trust - more important than any other stewards, and they should live in such a manner as to receive the approbation of their master.<p>3. It is of little consequence what the world thinks of us; <a href="/1_corinthians/4-3.htm">1 Corinthians 4:3</a>. A good name is on many accounts desirable; but it should not be the leading consideration; nor should we do anything merely to obtain it. Desirable as is a fair reputation, yet the opinion of the world is not to be too highly valued; because - <p>(1) It often misjudges;<p>(2) It is prejudiced for or against us;<p>(3) It is not to decide our final destiny;<p>(4)  To desire that simply, is a selfish and base passion.<p>4. The esteem even of friends is not to be the leading object of life; <a href="/1_corinthians/4-2.htm">1 Corinthians 4:2</a>. This is valuable, but not so valuable as the approbation of God. Friends are partial, and even where they do not approve our course, if we are conscientious, we should be willing to bear with their disapprobation. A good conscience is everything. The approbation even of friends cannot help us on the Day of Judgment.<p>5. We should distrust ourselves; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-3.htm">1 Corinthians 4:3-4</a>. We should not pronounce too confidently on our motives or our conduct. We may be deceived. There may be much even in our own motives that may elude our most careful inquiry. This should teach us humility, self-distrust, and charity. Knowing our own liableness to misjudge ourselves, we should look with kindness on the faults and failings of others.<p>6.

Or "how will ye, that I should come unto you?" as the Arabic and Ethiopic versions read it: since the apostle had determined upon his coming to them: and had made mention of it, he puts it to them, in what manner they themselves would choose he should come unto them; <p>shall I come unto you with a rod; either as a schoolmaster, as were their false teachers, with a "ferula"; or as a father with a rod of correction and chastisement, assuming his paternal authority, putting on severe looks, and using roughness; or rather as an apostle with the apostolical rod; by which is meant not excommunication, which is what belongs to a whole community, and not any single person; but a power of inflicting punishment on the bodies of delinquents, by smiting with diseases, and even with death itself; for as the prophets of the Old Testament had a power from God of inflicting diseases and death upon offenders; so had the apostles of the New, as appears from the instances of Ananias, and Sapphira, and Elymas the sorcerer: <p>or in love, and in the spirit of meekness? with the affection of a father, with a pleasant countenance, and a meek spirit; in opposition to that roughness and sharpness, he had an authority, as an apostle of Christ, to use in proper cases; and therefore as the latter would be most eligible by them, his suggestion is, that they would behave accordingly, that there might be no occasion to come to them in the former manner, which was not desirable by him, There seems to be an allusion to a practice among the Jews, in the punishing of a drunkard or gluttonous person; the rule for which was this (w), <p>"they first correct him   "with words", or "with a rod", as it is written, <a href="/deuteronomy/21-18.htm">Deuteronomy 21:18</a> and have chastened him; but if he adds and repeats (i.e. goes on in his sin), then they stone him.'' <p>Or rather the allusion is to the judges in the sanhedrim, one of the instruments or ensigns of whose office was "a rod or staff" to smite with; it is said (x) of R. Hona, when he went to the sanhedrim, he used to say, bring me the instruments of the Tabernae (the place where the sanhedrim sat); what are they? "the staff" (in Cocceius's edition it is  "the rods", and the sandals, the trumpets, and the thongs); the gloss is, "the thong" for scourging, "the staff" (or rods) for beating the rebellious until they return, the "trumpets" for excommunication, and the "sandals" for plucking off the shoe; things in which the judges of the court were concerned, and here the apostle proposes to come as judge; see <a href="/1_corinthians/5-3.htm">1 Corinthians 5:3</a>. <p>(w) R.

QUESTIONS OF SOCIAL MORALS, 5–7. The Ap. has done with the subject of the Parties, which had claimed attention first because they sprung from a radical misconception of Christianity. But in this typical Hellenic community, <span class="ital">social corruptions</span> had arisen which, if not so universal, were still more malignant in their effect. The heathen converts of Cor[799], but lately washed from the foulest vice (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-9.htm" title="Know you not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,">1 Corinthians 6:9</a> ff.), were some of them slipping back into the mire (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-21.htm" title="And lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and that I shall mourn many which have sinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed.">2 Corinthians 12:21</a>). An offence of incredible turpitude had just come to the Apostle’s ears, to the shame of which the Church appeared indifferent (5.). This case, demanding instant judicial action (<a href="/context/1_corinthians/4-1.htm" title="Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God....">1 Corinthians 4:1-5</a>), leads the Ap. to define more clearly the relation of Christians to men of immoral life, as they may be found within or without the Church (<a href="/context/1_corinthians/4-6.htm" title="And these things, brothers, I have in a figure transferred to myself and to Apollos for your sakes; that you might learn in us not to think of men above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against another....">1 Corinthians 4:6-13</a>). From sins of <span class="ital">uncleanness</span> he passes in ch. 6 to acts of <span class="ital">injustice</span> committed in this Church, which, in one instance at least, had been scandalously dragged before the heathen law-courts (<a href="/context/1_corinthians/4-1.htm" title="Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God....">1 Corinthians 4:1-8</a>). In <a href="/context/1_corinthians/6-12.htm" title="All things are lawful to me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any....">1 Corinthians 6:12-20</a> P. returns to the prevalent social evil of Cor[800], and launches his solemn interdict against <span class="ital">fornication</span>, which was, seemingly, sheltered under the pretext of Christian liberty! It is just here, and in the light of the principles now developed, that P. takes up the question of <span class="ital">marriage or celibacy</span>, discussed at large in ch. 7. The fact that the Ap. turns at this juncture to the topics raised in the Church Letter, and that ch. 7 is headed with the formula <span class="greekheb">Περὶ δὲ ὧν ἐγράψατέ μοι</span>, must not be allowed to break the strong links of subject-matter and thought binding it to chh. 5 and 6 Its connexion with the foregoing context is essential, with the following comparatively accidental.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[799] Corinth, Corinthian or Corinthians.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[800] Corinth, Corinthian or Corinthians.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/1_corinthians/4.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">21</span>. <span class="ital">with a rod</span>] That is either (1) with some commentators, e.g. Chrysostom, the resolution to deliver the rebellious over to Satan (see next chapter). If this be the case, the word ‘power’ in the last verse must include power to do harm. But it is better (2) to refer the expression to the severity of language which the Apostle would be compelled to use, if there were no signs of improvement when he came. This falls in best with the fatherly relation, involving of course the idea of correction, in which he describes himself as standing towards the Corinthian Church. See <span class="ital"><a href="/1_corinthians/4-15.htm" title="For though you have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet have you not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.">1 Corinthians 4:15</a></span>, and compare <a href="/proverbs/13-24.htm" title="He that spares his rod hates his son: but he that loves him chastens him betimes.">Proverbs 13:24</a>; <a href="/context/proverbs/23-13.htm" title="Withhold not correction from the child: for if you beat him with the rod, he shall not die....">Proverbs 23:13-14</a>, &c. The words ‘spirit of meekness’ in the last part of the verse confirm this last interpretation. The literal translation is ‘<span class="ital">in</span> a rod,’ referring to the <span class="ital">spirit</span> in which the Apostle was to come. ‘Am I to come to you in a spirit of correction, or in a spirit of meekness?’<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/1_corinthians/4.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/1_corinthians/4-21.htm" title="What will you? shall I come to you with a rod, or in love, and in the spirit of meekness?">1 Corinthians 4:21</a>. <span class="greekheb">Τί θέλετε</span>, <span class="ital">what will ye?</span>) Choose.
