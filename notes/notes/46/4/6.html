All that was said in condemnation of the spirit which exalted the Apostle and Apollos into party leaders, would apply with equal or greater force to all others; for they, as the planter and the waterer of the Corinthian vineyard, the layer of the foundation and the builder up of the Corinthian spiritual temple, were certainly the two whose exaltation by their followers might have seemed most pardonable.<p><span class= "bld">That ye might learn in us . . .</span><span class= "ital">—i.e.,</span> “by our examples” you should learn not to go beyond what is written in the Scriptures—not to be found in any one particular passage, but in the general tone and scope of the Old Testament writings, which ever ascribe glory to God alone (as found in the passages referred to in <a href="/1_corinthians/1-19.htm" title="For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.">1Corinthians 1:19</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/1-31.htm" title="That, according as it is written, He that glories, let him glory in the Lord.">1Corinthians 1:31</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/3-19.htm" title="For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God.

They had a great trust, and for that reason, had an honourable office. Paul had a just concern for his own reputation, but he knew that he who chiefly aimed to please men, would not prove himself a faithful servant of Christ. It is a comfort that men are not to be our final judges. And it is not judging well of ourselves, or justifying ourselves, that will prove us safe and happy. Our own judgment is not to be depended upon as to our faithfulness, any more than our own works for our justification. There is a day coming, that will bring men's secret sins into open day, and discover the secrets of their hearts. Then every slandered believer will be justified, and every faithful servant approved and rewarded. The word of God is the best rule by which to judge as to men. Pride commonly is at the bottom of quarrels. Self-conceit contributes to produce undue esteem of our teachers, as well as of ourselves. We shall not be puffed up for one against another, if we remember that all are instruments, employed by God, and endowed by him with various talents.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And these things - The things which I have written respecting religious teachers <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-5.htm">1 Corinthians 2:5-6</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-12.htm">1 Corinthians 2:12</a>, and the impropriety of forming sects called after their names.<p>I have in a figure transferred to myself and Apollos - The word used here &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;  metesche&#772;matisa denotes, properly, to put on another form or figure; "to change" (<a href="//biblehub.com/philippians/3-21.htm">Philippians 3:21</a>, "who shall change our vile body"); to "transform" (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-13.htm">2 Corinthians 11:13</a>, "transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ"); and then to apply in the way of a figure of speech. This may mean that neither Paul, Apollos, or Peter, were set up among the Corinthians as heads of parties, but that Paul here made use of their names to show how improper it would be to make them the head of a party, and hence, how improper it was to make any religious teacher the head of a party; or Paul may mean to say that he had mentioned himself and Apollos particularly, to show the impropriety of what had been done; since, if it was improper to make them heads of parties, it was much more so to make inferior teachers the leaders of factions.<p>Locke adopts the former interpretation. The latter is probably the true interpretation, for it is evident from <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-12.htm">1 Corinthians 1:12-13</a>, that there were parties in the church at Corinth that were called by the names of Paul, and Apollos, and Peter; and Paul's design here was to show the impropriety of this by mentioning himself, Apollos, and Peter, and thus by transferring the whole discussion from inferior teachers and leaders to show the impropriety of it. He might have argued against the impropriety of following other leaders. He might have mentioned their names. But this would have been invidious and indelicate. It would have excited their anger. He therefore says that he had transferred it all to himself and Apollos; and it implied that if it were improper to split themselves up into factions with them as leaders, much more was it improper to follow others; that is, it was improper to form parties at all in the church. "I mention this of ourselves; out of delicacy I forbear to mention the names of others" - And this was one of the instances in which Paul showed great tact in accomplishing his object, and avoiding offence.<p>For your sakes - To spare your feelings; or to show you in an inoffensive manner what I mean. And particularly by this that you may learn not to place an inordinate value on people.<p>That ye might learn in us - Or by our example and views.<p>Not to think ... - Since you see the plan which we desire to take; since you see that we who have the rank of apostles, and have been so eminently favored with endowments and success, do not wish to form parties, that you may also have the same views in regard to others.<p>Above that which is written - Probably referring to what he had said in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-5.htm">1 Corinthians 3:5-9</a>, <a href="/1_corinthians/3-21.htm">1 Corinthians 3:21</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/4-1.htm">1 Corinthians 4:1</a>. Or it may refer to the general strain of Scripture requiring the children of God to be modest and humble.<p>That no one of you be puffed up - That no one be proud or exalted in self-estimation above his neighbor. That no one be disposed to look upon others with contempt, and to seek to depress and humble them. They should regard themselves as brethren, and as all on a level. The argument here is, that if Paul and Apollos did not suppose that they had a right to put themselves at the head of parties, much less had any of them a right to do so. The doctrine is:<p>(1) That parties are improper in the church;<p>(2) That Christians should regard themselves as on a level; and,<p>(3) That no one Christian should regard others as beneath him, or as the object of contempt. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6.

Lastly, it is also a mistake (see Introd. § 1) to interpret it with Chrysostom, Erasmus, Beza, Vatablus, Cornelius a Lapide, and others: “I have put our names as <span class="ital">fictitious</span> in place of those of the <span class="ital">actual</span> leaders of parties;”[620] or to hold, with Pareus and Mosheim, that <span class="greekheb">μετασχ</span>. refers to the homely <span class="ital">figures</span> which Paul has used of himself and Apollos (gardeners, husbandmen, builders, house-rewards), from which the steaders were to learn humility. These figures were surely lofty enough, since they represented the teachers as <span class="greekheb">Θεοῦ συνεργούς</span>!

On these grounds Billroth and Rückert assume that Paul had meant to form the subjunctive, but had formed it wrongly; so too, before them, Bengel characterized the form as a “singularis ratio contractionis;” and Reiche also, in his <span class="ital">Comment. crit.</span> I. p. 152, satisfies himself with the notion of an erroneously formed contraction. As if we were warranted in taking for granted that the most fluent in language of the apostles could not be safely trusted with forming the mood of a verb in <span class="greekheb">οω</span>! Winer finds here an improper usage of the later Greek.[634] But, apart from the absence of all proof for this usage in the apostolic age (it can only be proved in much later writings, as also in modern Greek; see Winer, p. 272 [E. T. 362]), had Paul adopted it, he would have brought it in oftener, and not have written correctly in <span class="ital">every</span> other case;[635] least of all, too, would he have put the <span class="ital">indicative</span> here, when he had just used the correct <span class="ital">subjunctive</span> immediately before it (<span class="greekheb">μάθητε</span>). Fritzsche (<span class="ital">a</span>[636]<span class="ital"> Matth.</span> p. 836) took <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἽΝΑ</span></span></span> as <span class="ital">ubi</span>, and explained: “<span class="ital">ubi</span> (i.e. <span class="ital">qua conditione</span>, quando demisse de vobis statuere nostra exemplo didiceritis) <span class="ital">minime alter in alterius detrimentum extollitur</span>.” At a later date (in <span class="ital">Fritzschiorum opusc.</span> p. 186 ff.) he wished to resort to <span class="ital">emendation</span>, namely: <span class="greekheb">ἵνα ʼν ἡμῖν μάθητε τὸ μὴ ὑπὲρ ὃ γέγραπται φρονεῖν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἕνα μὴ ὑπὲρ τοῦ ἑνὸς φυσιοῦσθαι κατὰ τοῦ ἑτέρου</span> (so, too, very nearly Theodoret). But although it might easily enough have happened that <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἽΝΑ ΜΉ</span></span></span> should be written by mistake in place of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἝΝΑ ΜΉ</span></span></span>, the consequence of that mistake would in that case necessarily have been the alteration of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΦΥΣΙΟῦΣΘΑΙ</span></span></span>,[637] not into <span class="greekheb">φυσιοῦσθε</span>, but into <span class="greekheb">φυσιῶσθε</span>, and the <span class="ital">subjunctive</span>, not the indicative, must therefore have had the preponderance of critical evidence in its favour (but it is found, in point of fact, only in 44, Chrys. ms.). The only explanation of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἽΝΑ</span></span></span> which is in accordance with the laws of the language, and therefore the only admissible one, is that given by Fritzsche, <span class="ital">a</span>[638]<span class="ital"> Matth. l.c</span>[639]; <span class="greekheb">ἵνα</span> <span class="ital">cannot</span> be the particle of <span class="ital">design</span>, because it is followed by the indicative; it <span class="ital">must</span>, on the contrary, be the <span class="ital">local</span> particle, <span class="ital">where</span>, and that in the sense of <span class="ital">whereby, under which relation</span>, so that it expresses the <span class="ital">position of the case</span> (Homer, <span class="ital">Od.</span> vi. 27; Plato, <span class="ital">Gorg.</span> p. 484 E; Sophocles, <span class="ital">Oed.

To put down the indicative to the account of the transcribers, has against it the almost unanimous agreement of the critical evidence in excluding the subjunctive (which would be inexplicable, on the supposition of the indicative not being the original). Again, to trace it back to the origin of the Epistle by assuming that Paul made a slip in dictating, or his amanuensis in taking down his words, is all the more unwarranted, seeing that the self-same phenomenon recurs in <a href="/galatians/4-17.htm" title="They zealously affect you, but not well; yes, they would exclude you, that you might affect them.">Galatians 4:17</a>, while the clause here, as it stands, <span class="ital">admits</span> of a rendering which gives a good sense and is grammatically correct.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The subjective form of the negation <span class="greekheb">μή</span>, in the relative clause, has arisen from the <span class="ital">design</span> cherished by Paul, and floating before his mind.

The occasional use of this and similar expressions ("beloved," etc.) often serves to strengthen an appeal, or, as here, to soften the sternness of a rebuke. <span class="cmt_word">I have in a figure transferred to myself and to Apollos.</span> The meaning seems to be that St. Paul has prominently transferred to himself and to Apollos, or rather to the parties who chose their names as watchwords, the proof as to the sin and futility of partisanship which applied equally well to the parties which ranged themselves under other names. (For the verb "transfer" - more often "transform" see <a href="/2_corinthians/11-13.htm">2 Corinthians 11:13, 14, 15</a>; <a href="/philippians/3-21.htm">Philippians 3:21</a>.)

The word "to think" is omitted in the best manuscripts. The phrase, "which have been written," is of very uncertain meaning. It may refer generally to "the scriptural rule" that all boasting is wrong (<a href="/jeremiah/9-23.htm">Jeremiah 9:23</a>), or to the humble estimate of teachers which he has just been writing down for them. All his Old Testament quotations so far (ch. 1:19, 31; 3:19) have referred to humility. Some see in it a reference to <a href="/matthew/23-8.htm">Matthew 23:8</a> "Be not ye called Babbi;" but it is uncertain whether St. Matthew's Gospel was yet written; and St. Paul never refers so directly to any written Gospel. Perhaps it is a sort of proverb," Keep always to strict evidence;" "Say nothing which cannot be proved in black and white." The text, like so many others, has only a very remote connection with the sense in which it is usually quoted. <span class="cmt_word">That no one of you he puffed up.</span> St. Paul was painfully impressed by this <span class="accented">inflation</span> of the Corinthians, and he often recurs to this word as a description of their vain conceit (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-18.htm">1 Corinthians 4:18, 19</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/5-2.htm">1 Corinthians 5:2</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/8-1.htm">1 Corinthians 8:1</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/13-4.htm">1 Corinthians 13:4</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/12-20.htm">2 Corinthians 12:20</a>). In other Epistles the word is only found once (in <a href="/colossians/2-18.htm">Colossians 2:18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For one against another.</span> The expression is a profound one. The glorying in men (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-21.htm">1 Corinthians 3:21</a>), undesirable in any circumstances, becomes the more pernicious because the exaltation of one set of teachers is almost invariably accompanied by mean and unjust depreciation of any who could be supposed to be their rivals.
