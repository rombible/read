The argument here is that, as in the case of an earthly steward, inquiry is made into his character as to whether he be trustworthy—so it will be with them who are stewards of the mysteries of God.

They had a great trust, and for that reason, had an honourable office. Paul had a just concern for his own reputation, but he knew that he who chiefly aimed to please men, would not prove himself a faithful servant of Christ. It is a comfort that men are not to be our final judges. And it is not judging well of ourselves, or justifying ourselves, that will prove us safe and happy. Our own judgment is not to be depended upon as to our faithfulness, any more than our own works for our justification. There is a day coming, that will bring men's secret sins into open day, and discover the secrets of their hearts. Then every slandered believer will be justified, and every faithful servant approved and rewarded. The word of God is the best rule by which to judge as to men. Pride commonly is at the bottom of quarrels. Self-conceit contributes to produce undue esteem of our teachers, as well as of ourselves. We shall not be puffed up for one against another, if we remember that all are instruments, employed by God, and endowed by him with various talents.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Moreover ... - The fidelity required of stewards seems to be adverted to here, in order to show that the apostles acted from a higher principle than a desire to please man, or to be regarded as at the head of a party; and they ought so to esteem them as bound, like all stewards, to be faithful to the master whom they served.<p>It is required ... - It is expected of them; it is the "main" or "leading" thing in their office. Eminently in that office fidelity is required as an indispensable and cardinal virtue. Fidelity to the master, faithfulness to his trust, as the virtue which by way of eminence is demanded there. In other offices other virtues may be particularly required. But here fidelity is demanded. This is required particularly because it is an office of trust; because the master's goods are at his disposal; because there is so much opportunity for the steward to appropriate those goods to his own use, so that his master cannot detect it. There is a strong similarity between the office of a steward and that of a minister of the gospel. But it is not needful here to dwell on the resemblance. The idea of Paul seems to be:<p>(1) That a minister, like a steward, is devoted to his master's service, and should regard himself as such.<p>(2) that he should be faithful to that trust, and not abuse or violate it.<p>(3) that he should not be judged by his fellow-stewards, or fellow-servants, but that his main desire should be to meet with the approbation of his master - A minister should be faithful for obvious reasons. Because:<p>(a) He is appointed by Jesus Christ;<p>(b) Because he must answer to him;<p>(c) Because the honor of Christ, and the welfare of his kingdom is entrusted to him; and,<p>(d) Because of the importance of the matter committed to his care; and the importance of fidelity can be measured only by the consequences of his labors to those souls in an eternal heaven or an eternal hell. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. Moreover&#8212;The oldest manuscripts read, "Moreover here" (that is, on earth). The contrast thus is between man's usage as to stewards (1Co 4:2), and God's way (1Co 4:3). Though here below, in the case of stewards, inquiry is made, that one man be found (that is, proved to be) faithful; yet God's steward awaits no such judgment of man, in man's day, but the Lord's judgment in His great day. Another argument against the Corinthians for their partial preferences of certain teachers for their gifts: whereas what God requires in His stewards is faithfulness (1Sa 3:20, Margin; Heb 3:5); as indeed is required in earthly stewards, but with this difference (1Co 4:3), that God's stewards await not man's judgment to test them, but the testing which shall be in the day of the Lord.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_corinthians/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> It is required of all servants, but especially of chief servants, such as stewards are, who are intrusted with their masters’ goods, to be dispensed out to others. The faithfulness of a steward in dispensing out his master’s goods lies in his giving them out according to his master’s order, giving to every one their portion, not detaining any thing from others which it is his master’s will they should have; as Paul gloried, <span class="bld"><a href="/acts/20-20.htm" title="And how I kept back nothing that was profitable to you, but have showed you, and have taught you publicly, and from house to house,">Acts 20:20</a>,27</span>, that he had <span class="ital">kept</span> <span class="ital">back</span> from the Ephesians <span class="ital">nothing that was profitable</span> for them, nor <span class="ital">shunned to declare</span> to them <span class="ital">all the counsel of God; </span> not giving holy things to dogs, or casting pearls before swine, contrary to Christ’s direction, <span class="bld"><a href="/matthew/7-6.htm" title="Give not that which is holy to the dogs, neither cast you your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you.">Matthew 7:6</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_corinthians/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Moreover, it is required in stewards,.... Upon mentioning that part of the character of Gospel preachers, as stewards, the apostle is put in mind of, and so points out that which is principally necessary in such persons: as, <p>that a man be found faithful; to the trust reposed in him; to his Lord and master that has appointed him to this office; and to the souls that are under his care: and then may a minister be said to be so, and which is his greatest glory, when he preaches the pure Gospel of Christ without any human mixtures, the doctrines and inventions of men; and the whole Gospel, declaring all the counsel of God, keeping back nothing which may be profitable to souls; when he seeks not to please men, but God; and not his own glory, and the applause of men, but the honour of Christ, and the good of souls: and such a faithful steward was the apostle himself. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_corinthians/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{2}</span> Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.</span><p>(2) Last of all, he warns the ministers that they also do not behave themselves as lords, but as faithful servants, because they must render an account of their stewardship to God.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/1_corinthians/4.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/1_corinthians/4-2.htm" title="Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.">1 Corinthians 4:2</a>. If we read <span class="greekheb">ὧδε</span> (see the critical remarks), we must understand the verse thus: <span class="ital">Such being the state of the case, it is, for the rest, required of the stewards</span>, etc., so that <span class="greekheb">λοιπόν</span> (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-16.htm" title="And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other.">1 Corinthians 1:16</a>) would express something which, in connection with the relationship designed in <a href="/1_corinthians/4-1.htm" title="Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.">1 Corinthians 4:1</a>, remained now alone to be mentioned as pertaining thereto, while <span class="greekheb">ὧδε</span>[600] again, quite in accordance with the old classical usage (see Lehrs, <span class="ital">Arist.</span> p. 84 ff.), would convey the notion of <span class="ital">sic</span>, i.e. “<span class="ital">cum eo statu res nostrae sint</span>” (Ellendt, <span class="ital">Lex. Soph.</span> II. p. 991). We might paraphrase, therefore, as follows: “<span class="ital">Such being the nature of our position as servants, the demand to be made upon the stewards of households</span>[601] <span class="ital">of course takes effect</span>.” If we abide by the <span class="ital">Recept</span>[602], <span class="greekheb">ὃ δὲ λοιπόν</span> must be rendered: <span class="ital">But as to what remains, i.e.</span> but as respects what else there is which has its place in connection with the relationship of service spoken of in <a href="/1_corinthians/4-1.htm" title="Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.">1 Corinthians 4:1</a>, this is the demand, etc.; comp on <a href="/romans/6-10.htm" title="For in that he died, he died to sin once: but in that he lives, he lives to God.">Romans 6:10</a>. It is a perversion of the passage to make it refer, as Billroth does, to the preceding depreciation of the supposed merits of the teachers: “<span class="ital">but what still remains for them is, that they can at least strive for the praise of faithfulness</span>.” The rest of the verse says nothing at all about a being able to strive; for <span class="greekheb">ζητεῖται ἐν</span> means nothing else but: <span class="ital">it is sought at their hand</span> (<span class="ital">requiritur</span>), i.e. <span class="ital">demanded of them</span>. See Wetstein. Hofmann’s interpretation, too, is an impossible one. He makes <span class="greekheb">ὁ δὲ λοιπόν</span> down to <span class="greekheb">εὑρεθῇ</span> to be the <span class="ital">protasis</span>; <span class="greekheb">ἐμοὶ δὲ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>[604], and that running on as far as <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΎΡΙΌς ἘΣΤΙΝ</span></span></span> in <a href="/1_corinthians/4-4.htm" title="For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judges me is the Lord.">1 Corinthians 4:4</a>, to be the apodosis: As respects that, however, which … is further required, namely, that one be found faithful, it is to me, etc. This interpretation gives us, instead of the simple, clearly progressive sentences of the apostle, a long, obscurely and clumsily involved period, against which on linguistic grounds there are the two considerations—(1) that <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ὃ ΔῈ ΛΟΙΠῸΝ ΖΗΤΕῖΤΑΙ</span></span></span> would presuppose some demand already conveyed in ver 1, to which a new one was now added; and (2) that the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΈ</span></span></span> of the apodosis in <a href="/1_corinthians/4-3.htm" title="But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man's judgment: yes, I judge not my own self.">1 Corinthians 4:3</a> would require to find its antithetic reference in the alleged protasis in <a href="/1_corinthians/4-2.htm" title="Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.">1 Corinthians 4:2</a> (comp <a href="/acts/11-17.htm" title="For as much then as God gave them the like gift as he did to us, who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ; what was I, that I could withstand God?">Acts 11:17</a>; Baeumlein, <span class="ital">Partik.</span> p. 92 f.), namely, to this effect: <span class="ital">to me, on the contrary</span>, not concerned about this required faithfulness, <span class="ital">it is</span>, etc. Now the first is not the case, and the second would be absurd.
