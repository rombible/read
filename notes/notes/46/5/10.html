It would have been almost impossible for the command to be literally obeyed without the Christian withdrawing altogether from the business of life, so the Apostle explains that it is the fair fame and purity of the Church which he is anxious to preserve. There are so many fornicators, and covetous, and idolaters in this world (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the heathen world) that men <span class= "ital">must</span> meet with them. But the Christian must tolerate no such sins among themselves; they must exclude from the social circle any brother who, bearing the name of Christ, indulges in the vices of the heathen world.

Limitation of the prohibition alluded to in 1Co 5:9. As in dissolute Corinth to "company with no fornicators," &c., would be almost to company with none in the (unbelieving) world; ye need not utterly ("altogether") forego intercourse with fornicators, &c., of the unbelieving world (compare 1Co 10:27; Joh 17:15; 1Jo 5:18, 19). As "fornicators" sin against themselves, so "extortioners" against their neighbors, and "idolaters" against God. The attempt to get "out of the world," in violation of God's will that believers should remain in it but keep themselves from its evil, led to monasticism and its consequent evils.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_corinthians/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world; </span> I did not intend that admonition as to such persons as were no Christians, no members of the church (so this term <span class="ital">world</span> is used, <span class="bld"><a href="/john/15-19.htm" title="If you were of the world, the world would love his own: but because you are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.">John 15:19</a> 17:14</span>; and so it is to be interpreted here).

By "the fornicators of this world" are meant, such as were guilty of this sin, who were the men of the world, mere worldly carnal men, who were never called out of it, or ever professed to be; in distinction from those that were in the church, that had committed this iniquity; and the apostle's sense is, that his former prohibition of keeping company with fornicators was not to be understood as referring to such persons as were, out of the church, as if no sort of civil conversation and commerce were to be had with men of such, and the like infamous characters; or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters: that is, of this world; for this clause is to be understood of each of these; so we read (n) of , "the covetous of the world"; by the covetous are meant, either such who are given up to inordinate lusts, who work all uncleanness with greediness, and can never be satisfied with their filthy enjoyments; or such who are greedily desirous of riches and wealth, and of increasing their worldly substance by any method, right or wrong; and who not only withhold that which is meet from others, but will not allow themselves what is proper and necessary: "extortioners" are either "ravishers", as the word may be rendered: such who by force violate the chastity of others, youths or virgins; or robbers, who, by violence and rapine, take away that which is the fight and property of others; or such who oppress the poor, detain their wages by fraud, or lessen them, and extort that by unlawful gain, which is unreasonable: idolaters are those who worship the false deities of the Heathens, or any idol, graven image, or picture of God, or men, or any creature whatsoever, or any but the one Lord God. The apostle, under these characters, comprises all manner of sin against a man's self, against his neighbour, and against God; against himself, as fornication; against his neighbour, as covetousness and extortion; and against God, as idolatry: and since the world abounded with men guilty of these several vices, all kind of civil correspondence with them could not be avoided, <p>for then must you needs go out of the world; meaning not out of Greece, or of any of the cities thereof, into other parts, but out of the world itself; they must even destroy themselves, or seek out for a new world: it is an hyperbolical way of speaking, showing that the thing is impracticable and impossible, since men of this sort are everywhere; and were all trade and conversation with them to be forbidden, the families of God's people could never be supported, nor the interest of religion maintained; a stop would soon be put to worldly business, and saints would have little or nothing to do in the world; wherefore, as the Arabic version reads it, "business would compel you to go out of the world". <p>(n) Zohar in Exod. fol. 31. 2.<a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_corinthians/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Yet not <span class="cverse3">{h}</span> altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world.</span><p>(h) If you should utterly abstain from such men's company, you should go out of the world.

More precise negative explanation of the rule laid down in the said letter, <span class="greekheb">μὴ συναναμ</span>. <span class="greekheb">πόρν</span>., which had been misinterpreted among the Corinthians (as Paul gathered probably from their letter to him) into a prohibition of association with fornicators <span class="ital">among those who were not Christians</span>; perhaps from a disposition to connive at the offenders within the bosom of the church itself.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">οὐ πάντως τοῖς πόρν</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>.] is dependent on <span class="greekheb">μὴ συναναμιγν</span>.; it stands in a relation of <span class="ital">opposition</span> to the preceding <span class="greekheb">πόρνοις</span>, and explains what that <span class="greekheb">πόρνοις</span> did <span class="ital">not</span> mean. “I wrote to you to refrain from intercourse <span class="ital">with fornicators</span>, (i.e.) <span class="ital">not absolutely</span>[827] <span class="ital">with the fornicators of this world</span>.” An entire cessation of intercourse with <span class="greekheb">πόρνοις</span> in that sense of the word, it would, of course, be impossible to establish, seeing that you cannot go out of the world; but what I meant was <span class="ital">Christians</span> given to fornication, <a href="/1_corinthians/5-11.htm" title="But now I have written to you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or an extortionist; with such an one no not to eat.">1 Corinthians 5:11</a>.

Comp Buttmann, <span class="ital">neut. Gr.</span> p. 334 [E. T. 389]. The conception is a different one, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, in Plato, <span class="ital">Pol.</span> iv. p. 419 A: <span class="greekheb">ἐὰν τίς σε φῇ μὴ πάνυ τι εὐδαίμονας ποιεῖν τούτους</span>. Commentators often supply <span class="greekheb">ἔγραψα</span> after <span class="greekheb">οὐ</span>; so, among the rest, Olshausen; <span class="ital">not (wrote I, meant I): with the fornicators of this world in general</span>. But what an arbitrary separation this is of the mutually connected words <span class="greekheb">οὐ πάντως</span>! And the interpretation in question has this, too, against it, that <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κόσμου τ</span>. does not refer to the world in general, but to those who were non-Christians (see below), so that the “<span class="ital">in general</span>” would be <span class="ital">logically</span> incorrect. Rückert takes <span class="greekheb">οὐ πάντως</span> as an intensified negative like that in <a href="/romans/3-9.htm" title="What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin;">Romans 3:9</a> (comp Luther), and supplies <span class="greekheb">ἔγραψα</span> after it: “<span class="ital">By no means did I write; i.e.</span>, the import of my prohibition was by no means, <span class="ital">to have no intercourse with the fornicators of this world</span>.” But so understood, the words would lend countenance to intercourse with fornicators not Christian, which cannot be Paul’s meaning. His intention is merely to set aside the misinterpretation which had been put upon his words, as if he had meant thereby to enforce an absolute cessation of intercourse with unchaste men outside the Christian society. Lastly, Billroth is wrong in rendering, after Chrysostom and Theophylact (<span class="greekheb">τὸ πάντως ὡς ἐπὶ ὡμολογημένου τέθεικε πράγματος</span>): “<span class="ital">not, of course, with the fornicators of this world</span>.” In that case, we should have had at least <span class="greekheb">πάντως οὐ</span>, for the sense would be, as Theophylact himself states: <span class="greekheb">καὶ πάντως οὐ τοῖς πόρνοις τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κόσμου συναναμίγνυσθαι ἐκώλυσα</span>, <span class="greekheb">τουτέστι τοῖς τῶν Ἑλλήνων</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τοῦ κόσμου τούτου</span>] <span class="ital">who belong to this</span> (<span class="ital">ante-Messianic</span>) <span class="ital">world</span>, not, like the Christians, to the Messiah’s kingdom as its future members; hence it is the <span class="greekheb">ἀλλότριοι τῆς πίστεως</span> (Theodoret) who are here denoted, whose opposite is the <span class="greekheb">ἀδελφός</span> in <a href="/1_corinthians/5-11.htm" title="But now I have written to you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or an extortionist; with such an one no not to eat.">1 Corinthians 5:11</a>. To understand it of <span class="ital">mankind in general</span>, Christians and non-Christians together (Pott, Hofmann, <span class="ital">al</span>[832]), is, seeing that <span class="greekheb">τούτου</span> is joined with it, contrary to the apostle’s mode of using language (<a href="/galatians/4-3.htm" title="Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world:">Galatians 4:3</a>; <a href="/colossians/2-8.htm" title=" Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.">Colossians 2:8</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-2.htm" title="Wherein in time past you walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now works in the children of disobedience:">Ephesians 2:2</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/3-19.htm" title="For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God.

Afterwards, when Paul is thinking of the world of men <span class="ital">in general</span>, he purposely omits the <span class="greekheb">τούτον</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἢ τοῖς πλεονέκταις κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>[833]] We may suppose that Paul, in the passage of his former letter now alluded to, had warned them not merely against <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΌΡΝΟΙς</span></span></span>, but also against those guilty of the other kinds of vice indicated here, and yet more specifically in <a href="/1_corinthians/5-11.htm" title="But now I have written to you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or an extortionist; with such an one no not to eat.">1 Corinthians 5:11</a>.

Hence it signifies (1) one who has more than enough, (2) who desires more than enough of whatever kind, (3) one greedy after money. In some passages it, and the substantive and verb of similar derivation, are used of sensual sin, as in <a href="/ephesians/5-3.htm" title="But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becomes saints;">Ephesians 5:3</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-6.htm" title="That no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter: because that the Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified.">1 Thessalonians 4:6</a>. In this verse, as well as in <a href="/ephesians/5-5.htm" title="For this you know, that no fornicator, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.">Ephesians 5:5</a>, and <a href="/colossians/3-5.htm" title=" Mortify therefore your members which are on the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:">Colossians 3:5</a>, these words are connected with idolatry; either (1) because the love of riches is a kind of idolatry (<a href="/1_timothy/6-17.htm" title="Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not high minded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who gives us richly all things to enjoy;">1 Timothy 6:17</a>) or (2) because the idolatrous rites of heathenism were so frequently stained with sensual indulgence. The verb formed from it generally signifies <span class="ital">to overreach, take advantage of</span>. Thus in <a href="/2_corinthians/2-11.htm" title="Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices.">2 Corinthians 2:11</a> it is translated ‘get an advantage of,’ in <a href="/1_corinthians/7-2.htm" title="Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband.">1 Corinthians 7:2</a> ‘defraud,’ and in <a href="/context/1_corinthians/12-17.htm" title="If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling?...">1 Corinthians 12:17-18</a> ‘make a gain of.’ Dean Stanley illustrates its use by the word <span class="ital">covet</span> as used in the Tenth Commandment; first in the ordinary sense of covetousness, ‘thou shalt not covet thy neighbour’s house,’ and next in the sense of sensual desire, ‘thou shalt not covet thy neighbour’s wife.’ We may also compare the words <span class="ital">greed</span> and <span class="ital">greedy</span>, which coming from the Anglo-Saxon <span class="ital">grædan</span> to cry, and kindred with the Gothic <span class="ital">greitan</span>, the Lowland Scotch <span class="ital">greet</span>, and the Italian <span class="ital">gridare</span>, words of similar signification, have diverged from one another in sense, and are used, the former exclusively of gain, the latter of the indulgence of appetite.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/1_corinthians/5.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/1_corinthians/5-10.htm" title="Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortionists, or with idolaters; for then must you needs go out of the world.">1 Corinthians 5:10</a>. <span class="greekheb">Καὶ</span>) <span class="ital">and that</span>.—<span class="greekheb">οὐ πάντως</span>, <span class="ital">not altogether</span>) What is here said is not a universal, but a particular negative, <a href="/romans/3-9.htm" title="What then? are we better than they?

The word may also mean "ravishers," but there is no reason to abandon the sense of "rapacious." <span class="cmt_word">Idolaters</span>. This is the earliest instance of the use of this word, which does not occur in the LXX. No Christian could still be an open "idolater." So, unless we suppose that the expression has slipped in involuntarily, we must here give the word a metaphorical sense, as in <a href="/colossians/3-5.htm">Colossians 3:5</a>. We must else be driven to suppose that there were some half and half Christians, like Constantine, who "feared the Lord, and served their own gods" (comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/6-9.htm">1 Corinthians 6:9</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/8-10.htm">1 Corinthians 8:10</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/10-7.htm">1 Corinthians 10:7, 14</a>; <a href="/ephesians/5-5.htm">Ephesians 5:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For then must ye needs go out of the world;</span> <span class="accented">for in that case</span> (as they had perhaps implied in their letter of questions to St. Paul) <span class="accented">ye would have been morally bound to leave the world altogether</span> and seek a new one. The Greek particle <span class="accented">ara</span> perhaps refers to the astonishment caused by their misapprehension of St. Paul's rule. The clause throws painful light on the condition of the heathen world. If all communication with "fornicators" was to be forbidden, the sin was so universal, especially at Corinth, that all intercourse with Gentiles would have be. come impossible. Even some who professed to be stern moralists among the heathen, like Cato and Cicero, looked on the sin as being, at the worst, quite venial, and even, under certain circumstances, commendable. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/1_corinthians/5.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Idolaters (&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;)<p>Only twice outside of Paul's writings: <a href="/revelation/21-8.htm">Revelation 21:8</a>; <a href="/revelation/22-15.htm">Revelation 22:15</a>.
