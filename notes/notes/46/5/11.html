It may seem strange that the word “idolater” should be included in this category; for in what sense could a “brother” be a worshipper of idols? It is probable that the word “idolater” has involved in it the idea, not merely of worshipping an image, but of the sensuality which accompanied various forms of heathen worship, and of which evidently some of the Corinthian brethren were partakers. (See <a href="/ephesians/5-5.htm" title="For this you know, that no fornicator, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.">Ephesians 5:5</a>, and <a href="/colossians/3-5.htm" title=" Mortify therefore your members which are on the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:">Colossians 3:5</a>, where “idolatry” is identified with a vice kindred to lasciviousness.)<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:9-13 Christians are to avoid familiar converse with all who disgrace the Christian name.

In this Epistle. This shows that he had written a former letter.<p>I have written to you. - Above. I have designed to give this injunction that you are to be entirely separated from one who is a professor of religion and who is guilty of these things.<p>Not to keep company - To be wholly separated and withdrawn from such a person. Not to associate with him in any manner.<p>If any man that is called a brother - Any professing Christian; any member of the church.<p>Be a fornicator ... - Like him who is mentioned, <a href="/1_corinthians/5-1.htm">1 Corinthians 5:1</a>.<p>Or an idolater - This must mean those persons who, while they professed Christianity, still attended the idol feasts, and worshipped there. Perhaps a few such may have been found who had adopted the Christian profession hypocritically.<p>Or a railer - A reproachful man; a man of coarse, harsh, and bitter words; a man whose characteristic it was to abuse others; to vilify their character, and wound their feelings. It is needless to say how much this is contrary to the spirit of Christianity, and to the example of the Master, "who when he was reviled, reviled not again."<p>Or a drunkard - Perhaps there might have been some then in the church, as there are now, who were addicted to this vice. It has been the source of incalculable evils to the church; and the apostle, therefore, solemnly enjoins on Christians to have no fellowship with a man who is intemperate.<p>With such an one no not to eat - To have no contact or fellowship with him of any kind; not to do anything that would seem to acknowledge him as a brother; with such an one not even to eat at the same table. A similar course is enjoined by John; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_john/1-10.htm">2 John 1:10-11</a>. This refers to the contact of common life, and not particularly to the communion. The true Christian was wholly to disown such a person, and not to do anything that would seem to imply that he regarded him as a Christian brother. It will be seen here that the rule was much more strict in regard to one who professed to be a Christian than to those who were known and acknowledged pagans. The reasons may have been:<p>(1) The necessity of keeping the church pure, and of not doing anything that would seem to imply that Christians were the patrons and friends of the intemperate and the wicked.<p>(2) in respect to the pagan, there could be no danger of its being supposed that Christians regarded them as brethren, or showed to them any more than the ordinary civilities of life; but in regard to those who professed to be Christians, but who were drunkards, or licentious, if a man was on terms of intimacy with them, it would seem as if he acknowledged them as brethren and recognized them as Christians.<p>(3) this entire separation and withdrawing from all communion was necessary in these times to save the church from scandal, and from the injurious reports which were circulated. The pagan accused Christians of all manner of crime and abominations. These reports were greatly injurious to the church. But it was evident that currency and plausibility would be given to them if it was known that Christians were on terms of intimacy and good fellowship with pagans and intemperate persons. Hence, it became necessary to withdraw wholly from them to withhold even the ordinary courtesies of life; and to draw a line of total and entire separation. Whether this rule in its utmost strictness is demanded now, since the nature of Christianity is known, and since religion cannot be in "so much" danger from such reports, may be made a question. I am inclined to the opinion that the ordinary civilities of life may be shown to such persons; though certainly nothing that would seem to recognize them as Christians. But as neighbors and relatives; as those who may be in distress and want, we are assuredly not forbidden to show toward them the offices of kindness and compassion. Whitby and some others, however, understand this of the communion of the Lord's Supper and of that only. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. But now&#8212;"Now" does not express time, but "the case being so," namely, that to avoid fornicators, &c., of the world, you would have to leave the world altogether, which would be absurd. So "now" is used in Heb 11:16. Thus we avoid making the apostle now retract a command which he had before given.<p>I have written&#8212;that is, my meaning in the letter I wrote was "not to keep company," &c.<p>a brother&#8212;contrasted with a "fornicator &#8230; of the world" (1Co 5:10). There is less danger in associating with open worldlings than with carnal professors. Here, as in Eph 5:3, 5, "covetousness" is joined with "fornication": the common fount of both being "the fierce and ever fiercer longing of the creature, which has turned from God, to fill itself with the inferior objects of sense" [Trench, Greek Synonyms of the New Testament]. Hence "idolatry" is associated with them: and the covetous man is termed an "idolater" (Nu 25:1, 2). The Corinthians did not fall into open idolatry, but ate things offered to idols, so making a compromise with the heathen; just as they connived at fornication. Thus this verse prepares for the precepts in 1Co 8:4, &c. Compare the similar case of fornication, combined with a similar idolatrous compromise, after the pattern of Israel with the Midianites (Re 2:14).<p>no not to eat&#8212;not to sit at the same table with such; whether at the love-feasts (agap&aelig;) or in private intercourse, much more at the Lord's table: at the last, too often now the guests "are not as children in one family, but like a heterogeneous crowd of strangers in an inn" [Bengel] (compare Ga 2:12; 2Jo 10, 11).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_corinthians/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Of late there have been some disputes what eating is here intended, whether at the Lord’s table, or at our common tables. Intimacy of communion is that which undoubtedly is here signified by eating; and the apostle’s meaning is, that the members of this church should forbear any unnecessary fellowship and communion with any persons that went under the name of Christians, and yet indulged themselves in any notorious and scandalous courses of life; of which he reckoneth up several sorts. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. Unclean persons, noted for any kind of uncleanness. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. Covetous persons; by which he understands all such as, out of their too great love of money, either scandalously sought to add to their heap, or to detain what was others’ just due. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. Idolaters; by which he understands such as out of fear, or to gain favour with the heathen amongst whom they lived, would frequent and perform Divine worship in the idol’s temple. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>4. Railers, such as used their tongues intemperately and scandalously, to the prejudice of others’ reputation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>5. Drunkards; under which notion he comprehends all such as drank hot liquors intemperately, whether they had such an effect upon them as to deprive them of the use of their reason or not. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>6. Extortioners, viz. such as, being in any place, exacted more than was their due of those that were under their power. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But yet by this interpretation the argument is not lost against eating with such at the table of the Lord, which is no more necessary communion with them, than civil eating is; for neither hath God spread that table for any such, neither ought any church to endure any such persons in its communion: nor are any Christians bound for ever to abide in the communion of that church, which shall wilfully neglect the purging out of such old leaven. Admitting this precept prohibitive of a civil intimacy with scandalous persons, though they be called brethren, it holds <span class="ital">a fortiori, </span> as a stronger argument against religious communion with such, in ordinances to which, apparently, they have no proximate right. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_corinthians/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But now have I written unto you,.... Which shows, that what he had written before was at another time, and in another epistle; but not that what he was now writing was different from the former, only he explains the persons of whom, and the thing about which he has before written: <p>not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother, be a fornicator; or if any man that is a brother is called, or named a fornicator; or covetous, or an idolater; or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner, with such an one, no, not to eat. The apostle's meaning is, that in his prohibition of keeping company with men of the above character, he would be understood of such persons as were called brethren; who had been received into the church, and had been looked upon, and had professed themselves to be such; and who might be mentioned by name, as notoriously guilty of fornication, covetousness, idolatry, and extortion, mentioned in the former verse; to which are added two other sins any of them might be addicted to, as "railing" either at their fellow brethren and Christians, or others giving reproachful language to them, and fixing invidious characters on them: and "drunkenness"; living in the frequent commission of that sin, and others before spoken of; and that such persons remaining impenitent and incorrigible, still persisting, in such a vicious course of life, after due admonition given them, were not only to be removed from their religious society, from the communion of the church, and be debarred sitting down, and eating with them at the Lord's table, or at their love feasts, but also were to be denied civil conversation and familiarity with them, and even not suffered to eat common food at the same table with them: which though lawful to be used with the men of the world, yet for some reasons were not advisable to be used with such; partly for vindicating the honour of religion, and preventing the stumbling of the weak; and partly to make such offenders ashamed, and bring them to repentance. The apostle alludes to the behaviour of the Jews, either to persons that were under any pollution, as a woman in the days of her separation, when her husband  , "might not eat with her" off of the same plate, nor at the same table, nor on the same cloth; nor might she drink with him, nor mix his cup for him; and the same was observed to persons that had issues on them (o): or rather to such as were under  "the sentence of excommunication", and such an one was obliged to sit the distance of four cubits from others, and who might not eat nor drink with him; nor was he allowed to wash and shave himself, nor a sufficiency of food, nor any to sit with him within the space of four cubits, except those of his house (p). <p>(o) Maimon.

But the whole context is against this; according to it, Paul’s design is simply to define more precisely the purport of that phrase in his former letters: “<span class="greekheb">μὴ συναναμίγνυσθαι πόρνοις</span>.” He has done this only <span class="ital">negatively</span> in <a href="/1_corinthians/5-10.htm" title="Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortionists, or with idolaters; for then must you needs go out of the world.">1 Corinthians 5:10</a>, but goes on now to do it <span class="ital">positively</span> in <a href="/1_corinthians/5-11.htm" title="But now I have written to you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or an extortionist; with such an one no not to eat.">1 Corinthians 5:11</a>.

Comp <span class="greekheb">ὄνομα ἔχειν</span>, <a href="/revelation/3-1.htm" title="And to the angel of the church in Sardis write; These things said he that has the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars; I know your works, that you have a name that you live, and are dead.">Revelation 3:1</a>. Estius, following Ambrosiaster, Augustine, and Oecumenius, joins <span class="greekheb">ὀνομαζ</span>. with what comes after, in the sense of: <span class="ital">if a brother is a notorious fornicator</span>, having the name of being such. But <span class="greekheb">ὀνομάζεσθαι</span> means always simply <span class="ital">to be called</span>, without any such pregnancy of significance either in a good or bad sense (even in <a href="/ephesians/1-21.htm" title="Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come:">Ephesians 1:21</a>; <a href="/ephesians/5-3.htm" title="But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becomes saints;">Ephesians 5:3</a>; <a href="/romans/15-20.htm" title="Yes, so have I strived to preach the gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I should build on another man's foundation:">Romans 15:20</a>).

For there is no indication in the text that the misinterpretation was a <span class="ital">wilful and malicious</span> one, arising out of <span class="greekheb">κακία κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">πονηρία</span>, ver. 8 (Hofmann).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[842] <span class="ital">n loc.</span> refers to the note of the commentator or editor named on the particular passage.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[843] <span class="ital">d</span> refers to the note of the commentator or editor named on the particular passage.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/1_corinthians/5.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/1_corinthians/5-11.htm" title="But now I have written to you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or an extortionist; with such an one no not to eat.">1 Corinthians 5:11</a>. <span class="greekheb">νῦν δὲ ἔγραψα</span>, “But now I have written”—in contrast to the <span class="greekheb">Εγραψα</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἐν τῇ ἐπιστ</span>. of <a href="/1_corinthians/5-9.htm" title="I wrote to you in an letter not to company with fornicators:">1 Corinthians 5:9</a> : “If any one doubted the purport of the former letter, it shall be impossible to mistake my meaning <span class="ital">now</span>”. The <span class="ital">logical</span> (not temporal) sense of <span class="greekheb">νῦν</span> (or <span class="greekheb">νυνί</span>) is preferred by some interpreters: “But now—<span class="ital">after this, as things now appear</span>—(you must understand that) I wrote,” etc., this <span class="greekheb">ἔγραψα</span> thus repeating the former. <span class="greekheb">Νυνὶ δὲ</span> bears the like emphatic temporal sense in <a href="/2_corinthians/8-11.htm" title="Now therefore perform the doing of it; that as there was a readiness to will, so there may be a performance also out of that which you have.">2 Corinthians 8:11</a>, <a href="/ephesians/2-13.htm" title="But now in Christ Jesus you who sometimes were far off are made near by the blood of Christ.">Ephesians 2:13</a>.—<span class="greekheb">ἐάν τις ἀδελφὸς ὀνομαζόμενος</span>, “if any one bearing the name of <span class="ital">brother</span>”—the point of the amended rule, which P. in writing before had apparently left to the common-sense of his readers, but is compelled to make explicit. So the <span class="greekheb">μὴ συναναμίγνυσθαι</span> clearly signifies <span class="ital">not to hold fraternal, friendly commerce</span> with vicious men: <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/1_corinthians/15-33.htm" title="Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.">1 Corinthians 15:33</a>.

If the ref[875] be restricted to <span class="ital">Christian</span> fellowship (<span class="ital">sc.</span> the Agapé), the emphatic <span class="ital">not even</span> is out of place” (Ed[876]). To forbid intercourse to this extent implies expulsion from the Church, <span class="ital">and more; cf.</span> <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-14.htm" title="And if any man obey not our word by this letter, note that man, and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed.">2 Thessalonians 3:14</a> f.

That it should be possible for an actual “idolater”—not merely one who “sits in an idol’s house” (<a href="/1_corinthians/8-10.htm" title="For if any man see you which have knowledge sit at meat in the idol's temple, shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols;">1 Corinthians 8:10</a>) as a place indifferent, or who still in some sort believes in its power (<a href="/1_corinthians/8-7.htm" title="However, there is not in every man that knowledge: for some with conscience of the idol to this hour eat it as a thing offered to an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled.">1 Corinthians 8:7</a>)—to be in the Church is evidence of the laxity of Cor[877] Christianity. That this was really the case, and that some Cor[878], perhaps of philosophical, semi-pantheistic tendencies, wished to combine the worship of the heathen temple with that of the Christian Church, appears likely from <a href="/context/1_corinthians/10-14.htm" title="Why, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry....">1 Corinthians 10:14-22</a>; the same syncretism is found in India now; <span class="ital">cf.</span> the case of Naaman, <a href="/2_kings/5-17.htm" title="And Naaman said, Shall there not then, I pray you, be given to your servant two mules' burden of earth? for your servant will from now on offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice to other gods, but to the LORD.">2 Kings 5:17</a> f.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[871] Greek, or Grotius’ <span class="ital">Annotationes in N.T.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[872]</span> J.
