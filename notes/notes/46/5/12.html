The apostle appeals to their own conduct, that they only reproved, censured, and punished with excommunication, such as were within the pale of the church, were members of it, and belonged unto it; nor did they pretend to exercise a power over others; and it would have been well if they had made use of the power they had over their own members, by admonishing and reproving such as had sinned; by censuring delinquents, and removing from their communion scandalous and impenitent offenders; and therefore they need not wonder that the apostle only meant fornicators, &amp;c. among them, and not those that were in the world, by his forbidding to company with such: reference seems to be had to ways of speaking among the Jews, who used not only to call themselves the church, and the Gentiles the world, and so them that were without, both their land and church; but even those among themselves that were profane, in distinction from their wise and good men. They say (q), <p>"if a man puts his phylacteries on his forehead, or upon the palm of his hand, this is the way of heresy (or, as in the Talmud (r), the way of the Karaites); if he covered them with gold, and put them upon his glove (or on his garments without, so Bartenora, or, as Maimonides interprets it, his arm, shoulder, or breast), lo, this is , "the way of them that are without":'' <p>on which the commentators (s) say, "these are the children of men, who walk after their own judgment, and not the judgment of the wise men": and Maimonides (t) says, they are such who deny the whole law, and neither believe anything, either of the written or the oral law. <p>(q) Misn.

Rückert thinks that Paul means to say: <span class="ital">Judging is not my matter at all</span> (seeing that the members of the church were judged by their fellow-members themselves; while those without, again, God would hereafter judge). But judging was doubtless his matter (see <a href="/context/1_corinthians/5-4.htm" title="In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when you are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,...">1 Corinthians 5:4-6</a>, <a href="/1_corinthians/5-11.htm" title="But now I have written to you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or an extortionist; with such an one no not to eat.">1 Corinthians 5:11</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/5-13.htm" title="But them that are without God judges.

There are here various changes of letters, by which the word <span class="greekheb">κρίνειν</span>, the most necessary of them all, is cancelled.

The phrase "them that are without" was originally a Jewish phrase. To the Jews all men were outsiders (<span class="accented">chitsonin</span>) except themselves. The phrase was adopted by Christians, but in a less contemptuous sense (<a href="/1_thessalonians/4-12.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:12</a>; <a href="/colossians/4-5.htm">Colossians 4:5</a>). We find a description of "those that were without" - "aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenant of promise" - in <a href="/ephesians/2-12.htm">Ephesians 2:12</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Do not ye judge them that are within!</span> An appeal to their own practice and to common sense.
