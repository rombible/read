The treatment of this subject occupies to <a href="/1_corinthians/4-20.htm" title="For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.">1Corinthians 4:20</a>. It is important to remember that the factions rebuked by St. Paul were not sects who separated themselves from the Church, but those who within the Church divided themselves into parties, each calling itself by the name of some Apostle whose teaching and practice were most highly esteemed. The nature and cause of these divisions we shall understand as we consider the Apostle’s exhortation to unity, and his rebuke of the spirit which gave rise to them.<p><span class= "bld">By the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span>—By his previous remark that they had been called unto “the communion” of this Holy Name, the writer has led up to the mention of Christ’s name—not in the form of an adjuration, but as reminding them of it. That very name adds strength to his exhortation to “speak the same thing”—<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> to call themselves by this one name, and not each (as in <a href="/1_corinthians/1-12.htm" title="Now this I say, that every one of you said, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.">1Corinthians 1:12</a>) by a different designation, and that there should be no “schisms” among them. The word translated “divisions,” signifies literally a “rent,” in which sense it occurs in <a href="/mark/2-21.htm" title="No man also sews a piece of new cloth on an old garment: else the new piece that filled it up takes away from the old, and the rent is made worse.">Mark 2:21</a> (“<span class= "ital">the rent</span> is made worse”), and is used three times in St. John’s Gospel in the sense of schism or difference of opinion (<a href="/john/7-43.htm" title="So there was a division among the people because of him.">John 7:43</a>; <a href="/john/9-16.htm" title="Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keeps not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them.">John 9:16</a>; <a href="/john/10-19.htm" title="There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings.">John 10:19</a>). See Note on <a href="/john/7-43.htm" title="So there was a division among the people because of him.">John 7:43</a>, as to the moral application of the word having probably come from Ephesus; and the idea of a tear or rent is carried on in the words, “be perfectly joined together,” which in the original signifies the repair of something which was torn, as in <a href="/matthew/4-21.htm" title="And going on from there, he saw other two brothers, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them.">Matthew 4:21</a> we have the word rendered “<span class= "ital">were mending</span> their nets.” The church at Corinth presents to the Apostle’s mind the idea of a seamless robe rent and torn into pieces, and he desires its complete and entire restoration by their returning to a united temper of mind and judgment as to word and deed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_corinthians/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/1_corinthians/1-10.htm" title="Now I beseech you, brothers, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that you be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.">1 Corinthians 1:10</a></span>. <span class="ital">Now I beseech, </span><span class="greekheb">παρακαλω</span>, <span class="ital">I exhort you, brethren </span>— You have faith and hope, secure love also; <span class="ital">by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ </span>— That endearing name, infinitely preferable to all the human names in which you glory. The apostle intending, says Locke, to abolish the names of the leaders, whereby the parties distinguished themselves, besought them by the name of Christ. Indeed, as the same writer observes, the apostle scarcely ever makes use of a word or expression which hath not some relation to his main purpose. <span class="ital">That ye all speak the same thing </span>— That ye agree both in your judgments and expressions concerning the doctrines of the gospel: or, that you do not unnecessarily and unkindly contradict each other, but rather maintain a peaceful and loving disposition toward each other. <span class="ital">And that there be no divisions </span>— Greek, <span class="greekheb">σχισματα</span>, <span class="ital">schisms, among you </span>— No alienation of affection from each other, and no factions or parties formed in consequence thereof: <span class="ital">but that ye be perfectly joined together </span>— <span class="greekheb">Κατηρτισμενοι</span>, <span class="ital">perfectly united, </span>or <span class="ital">knit together, in the same mind and in the same judgment — </span>Touching all the great truths of the gospel; waiving unnecessary controversies, debating those which are necessary with temper and candour, and delighting to speak most concerning those great and excellent things, in which, as Christians, you cannot but be agreed, and which, if duly considered, will cement your hearts to each other in the strictest and most tender bonds. “It was morally impossible, considering the diversities of their educations and capacities, that they should all agree in opinion; nor could he intend <span class="ital">that, </span>because he does not urge any argument to reduce them to such an agreement, nor so much as declare what that one opinion was in which he would have them agree. The words must therefore express that peaceful and unanimous temper, which Christians of different opinions may and ought to maintain toward each other; which will do a much greater honour to the gospel, and to human nature, than the most perfect uniformity that can be imagined.” — Doddridge. In short, “the meaning is, that in our deliberations we should yield to each other from mutual affection, and from a love of peace. Accordingly the heathen moralists describe true friendship as cemented by the same inclinations and aversions: <span class="ital">Idem velle, et idem nolle,” </span>&c.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:10-16 In the great things of religion be of one mind; and where there is not unity of sentiment, still let there be union of affection. Agreement in the greater things should extinguish divisions about the lesser. There will be perfect union in heaven, and the nearer we approach it on earth, the nearer we come to perfection. Paul and Apollos both were faithful ministers of Jesus Christ, and helpers of their faith and joy; but those disposed to be contentious, broke into parties. So liable are the best things to be corrupted, and the gospel and its institutions made engines of discord and contention. Satan has always endeavoured to stir up strife among Christians, as one of his chief devices against the gospel. The apostle left it to other ministers to baptize, while he preached the gospel, as a more useful work.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Now I beseech you, brethren - In this verse the apostle enters on the discussion respecting the irregularities and disorders in the church at Corinth, of which he had incidentally heard; see <a href="/1_corinthians/1-11.htm">1 Corinthians 1:11</a>. The first of which he had incidentally learned, was that which pertained to the divisions and strifes which had arisen in the church. The consideration of this subject occupies him to <a href="/1_corinthians/1-17.htm">1 Corinthians 1:17</a>; and as those divisions had been caused by the influence of phi osophy, and the ambition for distinction, and the exhibition of popular eloquence among the Corinthian teachers, this fact gives occasion to him to discuss that subject at length <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-17.htm">1 Corinthians 1:17-31</a>; in which he shows that the gospel did not depend for its success on the reasonings of philosophy, or the persuasions of eloquence. This part of the subject he commences with the language of entreaty. "I beseech you, brethren" - the language of affectionate exhortation rather than of stern command. Addressing them as his brethren, as members of the same family with himself, he conjures them to take all proper measures to avoid the evils of schism and of strife.<p>By the name - By the authority of his name; or from reverence for him as the common Lord of all.<p>Of our Lord Jesus Christ - The reasons why Paul thus appeals to his name and authority here, may be the following:<p>(1) Christ should be regarded as the Supreme Head and Leader of all his church. It was improper, therefore, that the church should be divided into portions, and its different parts enlisted under different banners.<p>(2) "the whole family in heaven and earth should be named" after him <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/3-15.htm">Ephesians 3:15</a>, and should not be named after inferior and subordinate teachers. The reference to "the venerable and endearing name of Christ here, stands beautifully and properly opposed to the various human names under which they were so ready to enlist themselves" - Doddridge. "There is scarcely a word or expression that he (Paul) makes use of, but with relation and tendency to his present main purpose; as here, intending to abolish the names of leaders they had distinguished themselves by, he beseeches them by the name of Christ, a form that I do not remember he elsewhere uses" - Locke.<p>(3) the prime and leading thing which Christ had enjoined upon his church was union and mutual love <a href="/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/john/15-17.htm">John 15:17</a>, and for this he had most earnestly prayed in his memorable prayer; <a href="//biblehub.com/john/17-21.htm">John 17:21-23</a>. It was well for Paul thus to appeal to the name of Christ - the sole Head and Lord of his church, and the friend of union, and thus to rebuke the divisions and strifes which had arisen at Corinth.<p>That ye all speak the same thing - "That ye hold the same doctrine" - Locke. This exhortation evidently refers to their holding and expressing the same religious sentiments, and is designed to rebuke that kind of contention and strife which is evinced where different opinions are held and expressed. To "speak the same thing" stands opposed to speaking different and conflicting things; or to controversy, and although perfect uniformity of opinion cannot be expected among people on the subject of religion any more than on other subjects, yet on the great and fundamental doctrines of Christianity, Christians may be agreed; on all points in which they differ they may evince a good spirit; and on all subjects they may express their sentiments in the language of the Bible, and thus "speak the same thing."<p>And that there be no divisions among you - Greek, &#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;  schismata, "schisms." No divisions into contending parties and sects. The church was to be regarded as one and indivisible, and not to be rent into different factions, and ranged under the banners of different leaders; compare <a href="/john/9-16.htm">John 9:16</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/11-18.htm">1 Corinthians 11:18</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/12-25.htm">1 Corinthians 12:25</a>.<p>But that ye be perfectly joined together - &#x3b7;&#787;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3b5; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;  e&#772;te de kate&#772;rtismenoi. The word used here and rendered "perfectly joined together," denotes properly to restore, mend, or repair that; which is rent or disordered <a href="/matthew/4-21.htm">Matthew 4:21</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/mark/1-19.htm">Mark 1:19</a>, to amend or correct that which is morally evil and erroneous <a href="//biblehub.com/galatians/6-1.htm">Galatians 6:1</a>, to render perfect or complete <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/6-40.htm">Luke 6:40</a>, to fit or adapt anything to its proper place so that it shall be complete in all its parts, and harmonious, <a href="/hebrews/11-5.htm">Hebrews 11:5</a>; and thence to compose and settle controversies, to produce harmony and order. The apostle here evidently desires that they should be united in feeling; that every member of the church should occupy his appropriate place, as every member of a well proportioned body, or part of a machine has its appropriate place and use; see his wishes more fully expressed in 1Co. 12:12-31.<p>In the same mind - &#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#836;&#768;  noi; see <a href="/romans/15-5.htm">Romans 15:5</a>. This cannot mean that they were to be united in precisely the same shades of opinion, which is impossible - but that their minds were to be disposed toward each other with mutual good will, and that they should live in harmony. The word here rendered "mind," denotes not merely the intellect itself, but that which is in the mind - the thoughts, counsels, plans; <a href="/romans/11-34.htm">Romans 11:34</a>; <a href="/romans/14-5.htm">Romans 14:5</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/2-16.htm">1 Corinthians 2:16</a>; <a href="/colossians/2-18.htm">Colossians 2:18</a>. Bretschneider.<p>And in the same judgment - &#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;  gno&#772;me&#772;. This word properly denotes science, or knowledge; opinion, or sentiment; and sometimes, as here, the purpose of the mind, or will. The sentiment of the whole is, that in their understandings and their volitions, they should be united and kindly disposed toward each other. Union of feeling is possible even where people differ much in their views of things. They may love each other much, even where they do not see alike. They may give each other credit for honesty and sincerity, and may be willing to suppose that others "may be right," and "are honest" even where their own views differ. The foundation of Christian union is not so much laid in uniformity of intellectual perception as in right feelings of the heart. And the proper way to produce union in the church of God, is not to begin by attempting to equalize all intellects on the bed of Procrustes, but to produce supreme love to God, and elevated and pure Christian love to all who bear the image and the name of the Redeemer. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10.

A union in opinion, as to the fundamental truths of religion, is (though not so easy, yet) what the church of God hath in a great measure arrived at. But for a union in every particular proposition of truth, is not a thing to be expected, though we all are to labour for it: God hath neither given unto all the same means, nor the same natural capacities. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_corinthians/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Now I beseech you, brethren,.... The apostle having observed the many favours and blessings bestowed on this church, proceeds to take notice of the divisions and contentions which were fomented in it; and in the most kind and tender manner entreats them to take every proper step to prevent schisms among them: he does not use his apostolical power and authority, or lay his injunctions and commands upon them, which he might have done, but most affectionately beseeches them; styling them brethren, as they were in a spiritual relation, being children of the same Father, members of the same body, and partakers of the same grace, and is a reason why they should not fail out by the way: and this obsecration is made <p>by the name of the Lord Jesus; which he wisely judged must have its weight and influence on many of them, to whom that name must be dear and precious, and which they called upon and were called by; and shows, that he was not acting in his own name, and seeking his own profit; but was concerned in and for the name of Christ, and for his honour and interest, which lay at stake by their contentions. His earnest request to them is, <p>that ye speak the same thing; profess the same truths, and express them in the same words; which shows the lawfulness, yea, necessity and usefulness, of confessions and articles of faith, being made and agreed to by members of churches; and which should be drawn up in a form of sound words, and abode by; for the introducing of new words and phrases is often the means of bringing in new doctrines, and of raising great contentions and animosities; wherefore using the same words to express truth by is a very proper and prudent expedient to prevent them: <p>and that there be no divisions, or schisms <p>among you; which are generally made by innovations in doctrine, or worship; by forming new schemes of religion, new articles of faith, and modes of discipline: but <p>that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind, and in the same judgment; which regards not only the sameness of love and affection, to one another, being, as the first Christians were, of one heart and of one soul; but their agreement in their judgments and sentiments, of both doctrine and discipline; and such an entire harmony and symmetry among them, as in the members of the body, where each member and bone being in their proper place, exactly answer to, and tally with each other; and which is the most effectual way to speak the same things, and so bar against all schisms and divisions; and such an agreement is absolutely necessary to the peace, comfort, and well being of a church; for how should "two", and much less more, "walk together", unless they are "agreed?" <a href="/amos/3-3.htm">Amos 3:3</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_corinthians/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{12}</span> Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that <span class="cverse3">{13}</span> ye all speak the same thing, and <i>that</i> there be no divisions among you; but <i>that</i> ye be <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.</span><p>(12) Having made an end of the preface, he comes to the matter itself, beginning with a most grave testimony, as though they should hear Christ himself speaking, and not Paul.<p>(13) The first part of this epistle, in which his purpose is found, to call back the Corinthians to brotherly harmony, and to take away all occasion of discord.

But the recognized theological sense of the word ‘schisms’ renders it unsuitable here, where the idea is rather that of divisions in, than separation from, the Church.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">but that ye be perfectly joined together</span>] The Apostle is hardly to be supposed here to require absolute unity of opinion, a thing impossible among men, but rather that mutual affection which would knit the disciples together in all essentials, and would prevent all acrimonious discussion of non-essentials. The word rendered <span class="ital">joined together</span> is literally <span class="bld">fitted together</span>, as the fragments in a piece of mosaic, in which each minute portion exactly fills its proper place.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in the same mind and in the same judgment</span>] The word translated <span class="ital">mind</span>, which is kindred with the Latin <span class="ital">nosco</span> and our <span class="ital">know</span>, has the signification in the N. T. (1) of the organ of perception, <span class="ital">mind, intellect</span>, (2) of the perception which is the result of the action of that organ <span class="ital">understanding</span>, and (3) of the intellectual conviction which the understanding imparts. The latter is the meaning here. For an example of (1) see ch. <a href="/1_corinthians/2-16.htm" title="For who has known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.">1 Corinthians 2:16</a> and note; of (2) see <a href="/revelation/13-18.htm" title="Here is wisdom.

In <a href="/romans/7-25.htm" title="I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.">Romans 7:25</a> it would seem to have (4) a meaning which includes moral as well as intellectual qualities.

This very title involves an appeal to them to aim at unity among themselves; and St. Paul, like St. James (James 5:10), uses it to soften any austerity which might seem to exist in his language (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-29.htm">1 Corinthians 7:29</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/10-1.htm">1 Corinthians 10:1</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/14-20.htm">1 Corinthians 14:20</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Through the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ;</span> that is, by the whole idea of Christ's being and office - the strongest bond of union between true Christians (see the powerful appeal in <a href="/ephesians/4-1.htm">Ephesians 4:1-6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That ye all speak the same thing;</span> that is, "that ye may all with one mind and one mouth glorify God" (<a href="/romans/15-6.htm">Romans 15:6</a>). They were doing the very reverse - each glorifying himself and his party (ver. 12). <span class="cmt_word">Divisions</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>); "schisms" used of bodies within the Church, not of separatists from it (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-18.htm">1 Corinthians 11:18</a>). The word is only used in this special sense in this Epistle. In <a href="/matthew/9-16.htm">Matthew 9:16</a> and <a href="/mark/2-21.htm">Mark 2:21</a> <span class="accented">schisma</span> means "a rent;" in John (<a href="/john/7-43.htm">John 7:43</a>; <a href="/john/9-16.htm">John 9:16</a>; <a href="/john/10-19.htm">John 10:19</a>), "a division of opinion." There would be little or no harm in the <span class="accented">schismata</span> so far as they affected unessential points, if it was not their fatal tendency to end in "contentions" (<span class="accented">erides</span>) and "factions" (<span class="accented">haireseis</span>, <a href="/1_corinthians/11-19.htm">1 Corinthians 11:19</a>). Corinth was a place where such divisions would be likely to spring up, partly from the disputatious vivacity and intellectual conceits of the inhabitants, partly from the multitudes of strangers who constantly visited the port, partly from the numerous diversities of previous training through which the various sections of converts had passed. <span class="cmt_word">Perfected together;</span> literally, <span class="accented">repaired, reunited.<span class="cmt_word"></span> In the same mind and in the same judgment</span>; that is, in what they think and believe (<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span>), and in what they assert and do (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x1fc3;</span>). The exhortation, "be of one mind," in every sense of the word, was as necessary in the ancient as in the modern Church (<a href="/romans/15-5.htm">Romans 15:5</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/13-11.htm">2 Corinthians 13:11</a>; <a href="/philippians/1-27.htm">Philippians 1:27</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-2.htm">Philippians 2:2</a>; <a href="/1_peter/3-8.htm">1 Peter 3:8</a>). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/1_corinthians/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>I beseech (&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#834;)<p>See on consolation, <a href="/luke/6-24.htm">Luke 6:24</a>. The word occurs more than one hundred times in the New Testament.<p>Divisions (&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;)<p>See on <a href="/john/10-19.htm">John 10:19</a>. In classical Greek used only of actual rents in material. So in <a href="/matthew/9-16.htm">Matthew 9:16</a>; <a href="/mark/2-21.htm">Mark 2:21</a>.

Here, faction, for which the classical word is &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;: division within the christian community. The divisions of the Corinthian church arose on questions of marriage and food (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-3.htm">1 Corinthians 7:3</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-5.htm">1 Corinthians 7:5</a>, <a href="/1_corinthians/7-12.htm">1 Corinthians 7:12</a>); on eating, meat offered to idols (<a href="/1_corinthians/8-7.htm">1 Corinthians 8:7</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/10-20.htm">1 Corinthians 10:20</a>); on the comparative value of spiritual endowments, such as speaking with "tongues" (14) ; on the privileges and demeanor of women in the assemblies for worship (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-5.htm">1 Corinthians 11:5-15</a>); on the relations of the rich and the poor in the agape or love-feasts (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-17.htm">1 Corinthians 11:17-22</a>); and on the prerogatives of the different christian teachers (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-12.htm">1 Corinthians 1:12</a>, <a href="/1_corinthians/1-13.htm">1 Corinthians 1:13</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-3.htm">1 Corinthians 3:3-22</a>).<p>Perfectly joined together (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;)<p>Rev., perfected together.

The distinction between mind and judgment is not between theoretical and practical, since &#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c2; mind, includes the practical reason, while &#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b7; judgment, has a theoretical side. Rather between understanding and opinion; &#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c2; regarding the thing from the side of the subject, &#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b7; from the side of the object. Being in the same realm of thought, they would judge questions from the same christian stand-point, and formulate their judgment accordingly. </body></html>
