But in the true church of God are all who are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, and who call upon him as God manifest in the flesh, for all the blessings of salvation; who acknowledge and obey him as their Lord, and as Lord of all; it includes no other persons. Christians are distinguished from the profane and atheists, that they dare not live without prayer; and they are distinguished from Jews and pagans, that they call on the name of Christ. Observe how often in these verses the apostle repeats the words, Our Lord Jesus Christ. He feared not to make too frequent or too honourable mention of him. To all who called upon Christ, the apostle gave his usual salutation, desiring, in their behalf, the pardoning mercy, sanctifying grace, and comforting peace of God, through Jesus Christ. Sinners can have no peace with God, nor any from him, but through Christ. He gives thanks for their conversion to the faith of Christ; that grace was given them by Jesus Christ. They had been enriched by him with all spiritual gifts. He speaks of utterance and knowledge. And where God has given these two gifts, he has given great power for usefulness. These were gifts of the Holy Ghost, by which God bore witness to the apostles. Those that wait for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, will be kept by him to the end; and those that are so, will be blameless in the day of Christ, made so by rich and free grace. How glorious are the hopes of such a privilege; to be kept by the power of Christ, from the power of our corruptions and Satan's temptations!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Even as - &#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c2;  Katho&#772;s. The force of this expression seems to be this, "The gospel of Christ was at first established among you by means of the miraculous endowments of the Holy Spirit. Those same endowments are still continued among you, and now furnish evidence of the divine favor, and of the truth of the gospel to you, 'even as' - that is, in the same measure as they did when the gospel was first preached." The power to speak with tongues, etc. <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14.htm">1 Corinthians 14</a> would be a "continued miracle," and would be a demonstration to them then of the truth of Christianity as it was at first.<p>The testimony of Christ - The gospel. It is here called "the testimony of Christ," because it bore witness to Christ - to his divine nature, his miracles, his Messiahship, his character, his death, etc. The message of the gospel consists in bearing witness to Christ and his work; see <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-1.htm">1 Corinthians 15:1-4</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/1-8.htm">2 Timothy 1:8</a>.<p>Was confirmed - Was established, or proved.

This, as it had been preached to the Corinthians, was confirmed and established among them, by the signs and miracles with which it was attended; by the extraordinary gifts of the Spirit, particularly of prophecy bestowed on many of them; and by the internal power and energy of the Spirit, accompanying and applying it to their souls. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_corinthians/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{9}</span> Even as the testimony of Christ was <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> confirmed in you:</span><p>(9) He shows that the true use of these gifts consists in this, that the mighty power of Christ might be set forth in them, that hereafter it might evidently appear how wickedly they abused them for glory and ambition.<p>(e) By those excellent gifts of the Holy Spirit.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/1_corinthians/1.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/1_corinthians/1-6.htm" title="Even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you:">1 Corinthians 1:6</a>. <span class="greekheb">Καθώς</span>] <span class="ital">According as</span>, introduces the relation of that happy condition of things (<span class="greekheb">ἐν παντὶ ἐπλουτίσθητε</span> … <span class="greekheb">γνώσει</span>) to its cause.
