The world by its wisdom did not attain to a knowledge of God in His wisdom displayed in creation (<a href="/acts/17-26.htm" title="And has made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and has determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation;">Acts 17:26</a>; <a href="/romans/1-19.htm" title="Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God has showed it to them.">Romans 1:19</a>).<p><span class= "bld">It</span> <span class= "bld">pleased God.</span>—The world having thus failed to gain a true knowledge of God in His wisdom, He gave them that knowledge through that very proclamation of “the cross” which those “that perish” call foolishness.

This is the sum and substance of the gospel. Christ crucified is the foundation of all our hopes, the fountain of all our joys. And by his death we live. The preaching of salvation for lost sinners by the sufferings and death of the Son of God, if explained and faithfully applied, appears foolishness to those in the way to destruction. The sensual, the covetous, the proud, and ambitious, alike see that the gospel opposes their favourite pursuits. But those who receive the gospel, and are enlightened by the Spirit of God, see more of God's wisdom and power in the doctrine of Christ crucified, than in all his other works. God left a great part of the world to follow the dictates of man's boasted reason, and the event has shown that human wisdom is folly, and is unable to find or retain the knowledge of God as the Creator. It pleased him, by the foolishness of preaching, to save them that believe. By the foolishness of preaching; not by what could justly be called foolish preaching. But the thing preached was foolishness to wordly-wise men. The gospel ever was, and ever will be, foolishness to all in the road to destruction. The message of Christ, plainly delivered, ever has been a sure touchstone by which men may learn what road they are travelling. But the despised doctrine of salvation by faith in a crucified Saviour, God in human nature, purchasing the church with his own blood, to save multitudes, even all that believe, from ignorance, delusion, and vice, has been blessed in every age. And the weakest instruments God uses, are stronger in their effects, than the strongest men can use. Not that there is foolishness or weakness in God, but what men consider as such, overcomes all their admired wisdom and strength.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For after that - &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#768;  epeide&#772;. Since, or seeing that it is true that the world by wisdom knew not God. After all the experience of the world it was ascertained that human beings would never by their own wisdom come to the true knowledge of God, and it pleased him to devise another plan for salvation.<p>In the wisdom of God - This phrase is susceptible of two interpretations:<p>(1) The first makes it refer to "the wisdom of God" evinced in the works of creation - the demonstration of his existence and attributes found there, and, according to that, the apostle means to say, that the world by a survey of the works of God did not know him; or were, notwithstanding those works, in deep darkness. This interpretation is adopted by most commentators - by Lightfoot, Rosenmuller, Grotius, Calvin, etc. According to this interpretation, the word &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;  en (in) is to be translated "by" or "through."<p>(2) a second interpretation makes it refer to the wise arrangement or government of God, by which this was permitted. "For when, by the wise arrangement or government of God; after a full and fair trial of the native, unaided powers of man, it was ascertained that the true knowledge of God would not be arrived at by man, it pleased him," etc. This appears to be the correct interpretation, because it is the most obvious one, and because it suits the connection best. It is, according to this, a reason why God introduced a new method of saving people. This may be said to have been accomplished by a plan of God, which was wise, because:<p>(1) It was desirable that the powers of man should be fully tried before the new plan was introduced, in order to show that it was not dependent on human wisdom, that it was not originated by man, and that there was really need of such an interposition.<p>(2) because sufficient time had been furnished to make the experiment. An opportunity had been given for four thousand years, and still it had failed.<p>(3) because the experiment had been made in the most favorable circumstances. The human faculties had had time to ripen and expand; one generation had had an opportunity of profiting by the observation of its predecessor; and the most mighty minds had been brought to boar on the subject. If the sages of the east, and the profound philosophers of the west, had not been able to come to the true knowledge of God, it was in vain to hope that more profound minds could be brought to bear on it, or that more careful investigation would be bestowed on it. The experiment had been fairly made, and the result was before the world; see the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/1.htm">Romans 1</a>.<p>The world - The people of the world; particularly the philosophers of the world.<p>By wisdom - By their own wisdom, or by the united investigations of the works of nature.<p>Knew not God - Obtained not a true knowledge of him. Some denied his existence; some represented him under the false and abominable forms of idol worship; some ascribed to him horrid attributes; all showed that they had no true acquaintance with a God of purity, with a God who could pardon sin, or whose worship conduced to holiness of life; see the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/1.htm">Romans 1</a>.<p>It pleased God - God was disposed, or well pleased. The plan of salvation originated in his good pleasure, and was such as his wisdom approved. God chose this plan, so unlike all the plans of human beings.<p>By the foolishness of preaching - Not "by foolish preaching," but by the preaching of the cross, which was regarded as foolish and absurd by the people of the world. The plan is wise, but it has been esteemed by the mass of people, and was particularly so esteemed by the Greek philosophers, to be egregiously foolish and ridiculous; see the note at <a href="/1_corinthians/1-18.htm">1 Corinthians 1:18</a>.<p>To save them that believe - That believe in the Lord Jesus Christ; see the note at <a href="/mark/16-16.htm">Mark 16:16</a>. This was the speciality and essence of the plan of God, and this has appeared to the mass of people to be a plan devoid of wisdom and unworthy of God. The preaching of the cross which is thus esteemed foolishness, is made the means of saving them, because it sets forth God's only plan of mercy, and states the way in which lost sinners may become reconciled to God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21. after that&#8212;rather, "whereas."<p>in the wisdom of God&#8212;in the wise arrangement of God.<p>world by wisdom&#8212;rather, "by its wisdom," or "its philosophy" (Joh 1:10; Ro 1:28).<p>knew not God&#8212;whatever other knowledge it attained (Ac 17:23, 27).

These words contain a reason proving the infatuation of men, with respect to "the wisdom of God"; by which may be meant either Christ, who is the wisdom of God, was in the world, and yet the world of the Jews, and their chief Rabbins among them, with all their wisdom, neither knew him, nor God his Father; or the Gospel, which is also so called, and though this was come, both into the Jewish and Gentile world, yet neither of them, by their natural wisdom, knew the God of grace, so manifestly revealed in it; or rather the works of creation, in which there is such a visible display of the wisdom of God: yet "the world by wisdom knew not God"; the author of them: the Gentiles knew him not in any spiritual and saving manner, as in Christ, or the God of all grace; yea, they knew him not as the God of nature to be the one, only, true God; they knew him not so as to glorify him as God, or to worship him in a right way and manner: wherefore, <p>it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe; it was his purpose and decree within himself; it was his sovereign good will and pleasure; it was what he, without any motion from, or merit in the creature, resolved of himself from all eternity that he would "save", not the wise man, the Scribe, the disputer of this world, the rationalist, the talker, nor the worker, but "them that believe" in his Son; that look unto him, venture on him, and commit the care and keeping of their souls to him, however weak, mean, and despicable they may otherwise be; or whether they believe with a weak, or a strong faith, so be it, it is but true: the Ethiopic version reads, "that believe in this foolish doctrine"; and this he determined to do, and did, "by the foolishness of preaching"; or by that sort of preaching, which both for the matter of it, Christ, that itself, and the manner of it, the world reckons foolishness; and which are the things of the Father's grace in election, of the Son's grace in redemption, and the Spirit's in regeneration: so the wise men of the world, with all their wisdom, are left ignorant of God, and perish in their sins, whilst the Gospel they despise is the power of God unto salvation to all that believe in Christ; this, through efficacious grace, becomes the means of regenerating and quickening men, showing them their need of salvation, and where it is, and of working faith in them to look to Christ for it. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_corinthians/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{23}</span> For after that in the <span class="cverse3">{q}</span> wisdom of God the <span class="cverse3">{r}</span> world by wisdom knew not God, <span class="cverse3">{24}</span> it pleased God by the <span class="cverse3">{s}</span> foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.</span><p>(23) He shows that the pride of men was worthily punished by God, because they could not behold God, as they properly should have, in the most clear mirror of the wisdom of the world, and this wisdom is the workmanship of the world.<p>(q) By the world he means all men who are not born again, but remain as they were, when they were first born.<p>(r) In the workmanship of this world, which has the marvellous wisdom of God engraved on it, so that every man may behold it.<p>(24) The goodness of God is wonderful, for while he goes about to punish the pride of this world, he is very provident and careful for the salvation of it, and teaches men to become fools, so that they may be wise to God.<p>(s) So he calls the preaching of the Gospel, as the enemies supposed it to be: but in the mean time he taunts those very sharply who had rather charge God with folly than acknowledge their own, and crave pardon for it.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/1_corinthians/1.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/1_corinthians/1-21.htm" title="For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.">1 Corinthians 1:21</a>.

By <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> Paul marks out the <span class="ital">sphere, in which</span> the negative fact of the <span class="greekheb">οὐκ ἔγνω</span> (“in media luce,” Calvin) took place; <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΟῦ ΘΕΟῦ</span></span></span> again is genitive <span class="ital">subjecti</span>, denoting, however, not the wisdom shown by God <span class="ital">in Christ</span> (Zachariae, Heydenreich, and Maier), nor Christ Himself even (Schrader and older expositors adduced by Estius), both of which would be quite unsuitable to the apodosis, but the wisdom of God manifested <span class="ital">before</span> Christianity in nature and Scripture.[238] Rückert is wrong in holding that <span class="greekheb">ἐν τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">σοφ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Θεοῦ</span> is: “<span class="ital">in virtue of the wisdom of God, i.e.</span> under its guidance and arrangement, the world knew not God through its own wisdom.” Certainly Paul would not be made by this interpretation to say anything which would in itself be at variance with his view of the divine relationship to the matter; for with him the two factors of human action, the divine causality and the human self-determination, are so associated, that he may bring now the one and now the other into the foreground (comp on Romans 9); but against it may be urged, partly the position of the words <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> … <span class="greekheb">Θεοῦ</span>, which on Rückert’s view would lose their weight and convey a thought here unessential, and partly the significant relation between the protasis and apodosis, according to which the measure taken by God (<span class="greekheb">εὐδόκησεν κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>[240]) appears as called forth by <span class="ital">men’s</span> lack of knowledge, and hence the <span class="greekheb">οὐκ ἔγνω</span> would in such a passage be most unsuitably referred to the appointment <span class="ital">of God</span>, so as to excuse what is declared in <a href="/romans/1-20.htm" title="For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:">Romans 1:20</a> to be inexcusable.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">οὐκ ἔγνω</span>] Seeing that the Jews also are included, and that anything which would contradict <a href="/context/romans/1-19.htm" title="Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God has showed it to them....">Romans 1:19-21</a> is out of the question, this must apply to the <span class="ital">true</span> knowledge of God, which was not attained, and which, if the <span class="greekheb">κόσμος</span> had reached it, would have caused the preaching of the cross to appear other than foolishness; comp <a href="/1_corinthians/2-14.htm" title="But the natural man receives not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness to him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.">1 Corinthians 2:14</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΙᾺ Τῆς ΣΟΦ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>] applies to the heathen <span class="ital">world-wisdom</span> and the Jewish <span class="ital">school-wisdom</span>, since it is the <span class="ital">means</span> of knowledge employed without result (observe that by the <span class="greekheb">οὐκ</span> <span class="ital">the whole</span> from <span class="greekheb">ἔγνω</span> to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΘΕΌΝ</span></span></span> <span class="ital">inclusive</span> is negatived) by the <span class="greekheb">κόσμος</span> for the knowing God.
