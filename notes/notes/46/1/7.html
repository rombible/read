But in the true church of God are all who are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, and who call upon him as God manifest in the flesh, for all the blessings of salvation; who acknowledge and obey him as their Lord, and as Lord of all; it includes no other persons. Christians are distinguished from the profane and atheists, that they dare not live without prayer; and they are distinguished from Jews and pagans, that they call on the name of Christ. Observe how often in these verses the apostle repeats the words, Our Lord Jesus Christ. He feared not to make too frequent or too honourable mention of him. To all who called upon Christ, the apostle gave his usual salutation, desiring, in their behalf, the pardoning mercy, sanctifying grace, and comforting peace of God, through Jesus Christ. Sinners can have no peace with God, nor any from him, but through Christ. He gives thanks for their conversion to the faith of Christ; that grace was given them by Jesus Christ. They had been enriched by him with all spiritual gifts. He speaks of utterance and knowledge. And where God has given these two gifts, he has given great power for usefulness. These were gifts of the Holy Ghost, by which God bore witness to the apostles. Those that wait for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, will be kept by him to the end; and those that are so, will be blameless in the day of Christ, made so by rich and free grace. How glorious are the hopes of such a privilege; to be kept by the power of Christ, from the power of our corruptions and Satan's temptations!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>So that - God has so abundantly endowed you with his favors.<p>Ye come behind - &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;  hustereisthai. You are not missing, or deficient. The word is usually applied to destitution, want, or poverty; and the declaration here is synonymous with what he had said, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-5.htm">1 Corinthians 1:5</a>, that they abounded in everything.<p>In no gift - In no favor, or gracious endowment. The word used here &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;  charisma, does not refer necessarily to extraordinary and miraculous endowments, but includes also all the kindnesses of God toward them in producing peace of mind, constancy, humility, etc. And the apostle meant evidently to say that they possessed, in rich abundance, all those endowments which were bestowed on Christians.<p>Waiting for - Expecting, or looking for this coming with glad and anxious desire. This was, certainly, one of the endowments to which he referred, to wit, that they had grace given them earnestly to desire, and to wait for the second appearing of the Lord Jesus. An earnest wish to see him, and a confident expectation and firm belief that he will return, is an evidence of a high state of piety. It demands strong faith, and it will do much to elevate the feelings above the world, and to keep the mind in a state of peace.<p>The coming ... - Greek The revelation - &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c8;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;  te&#772;n apokalupsin - the manifestation of the Son of God. That is, waiting for his return to judge the world, and for his approbation of his people on that Day. The earnest expectation of the Lord Jesus became one of the marks of early Christian piety. This return was promised by the Saviour to his anxious disciples, when he was about to leave them; <a href="/john/14-3.htm">John 14:3</a>. The promise was renewed when he ascended to heaven; <a href="/acts/1-11.htm">Acts 1:11</a>.

The proof of this is, first, that the immediately following <span class="greekheb">ἀπεκδεχομ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>[127] makes the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΜῊ ὙΣΤΕΡΕῖΣΘΑΙ ἘΝ ΜΗΔΕΝῚ ΧΑΡΊΣΜΑΤΙ</span></span></span> appear as an <span class="ital">ethical</span> endowment; second, that the significant retrospective reference of the <span class="greekheb">ἀνεγκλήτους</span> in <a href="/1_corinthians/1-8.htm" title="Who shall also confirm you to the end, that you may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.">1 Corinthians 1:8</a> does not suit the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΧΑΡΊΣΜΑΤΑ</span></span></span> in the narrower sense, but does suit all the more strikingly the moral character of the Christian gifts of the Spirit in general. The form of expression in the singular here stands as little in the way of this view (in opposition to Hofmann) as at <a href="/romans/1-11.htm" title="For I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift, to the end you may be established;">Romans 1:11</a>, and is, in fact, necessitated by the negative form of the discourse. Rückert, indeed, objects: “that Paul could not at all mean here those purely moral blessings, seeing that the Corinthians did not possess them.” The apostle, however, is not speaking of every individual, but of the church taken as a whole (comp already Chrysostom and Theophylact); and, moreover, expresses himself with much caution in a negative way, so that he only needs to answer for the presence of a <span class="ital">sufficienter praeditum esse</span> to stand comparison with other churches.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἀπεκδεχομ</span>. <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span></span></span>[129]] is a significant accompanying definition to what has gone before: <span class="ital">as persons, who</span> are not in any wise afraid of the revelation of Christ (<a href="/1_peter/1-7.htm" title="That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perishes, though it be tried with fire, might be found to praise and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ:">1 Peter 1:7</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-3.htm" title=" For you are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.">Colossians 3:3</a> f.) and wish it away, but who <span class="ital">are waiting</span> for it. This waiting and that afflux of grace stand in a mutual relation of action and reaction. Bengel says rightly: “<span class="ital">Character</span> Christiani veri vel falsi, revelationem Christi vel expectare vel horrere.” The fact that there were among the Corinthians deniers of the resurrection (and consequently of the Parousia in its full idea)—which, we may add, might naturally enough cause this hope to become all the more vividly prominent in the case of the rest—does not take away from the truth of the words, which hold good of the church <span class="ital">a potiori</span>. Just as little can they (contrary to the winning tone of the whole preamble) have it as their design to <span class="ital">terrify</span> with the thought of the day of judgment (Chrysostom), or to <span class="ital">censure</span> the doubters (Grotius, Rückert), or even to make <span class="ital">ironical</span> reference to the fancied perfection of the Corinthians (Mosheim). The participial clause, which needed neither <span class="greekheb">ὡς</span> nor the article, is not merely a <span class="ital">temporal</span> definition—consequently “<span class="ital">for the time</span>” of the waiting (Hofmann)—any more than at <a href="/titus/2-13.htm" title="Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Savior Jesus Christ;">Titus 2:13</a>; <a href="/romans/8-23.htm" title="And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.">Romans 8:23</a>; <a href="/judges/1-21.htm" title="And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day.">Judges 1:21</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἀπεκδ</span>.] denotes the <span class="ital">persevering</span> expectation.

The anarthrous pr[100] ptp[101] implies a continuous state conditioning that of the foregoing clause: the unstinted plenty of Divine gifts continued while the recipients fixed their thought upon the day of Christ; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-12.htm" title="Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?">1 Corinthians 15:12</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-33.htm" title="Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.">1 Corinthians 15:33</a> f. show that this expectation had been in many instances relaxed.

But this is not always equivalent to <span class="ital">coming</span>. The ‘revelation of Jesus Christ’ unquestionably means (1) the Last Day in such passages as <a href="/2_thessalonians/1-7.htm" title="And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels,">2 Thessalonians 1:7</a> and <a href="/1_peter/1-7.htm" title="That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perishes, though it be tried with fire, might be found to praise and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ:">1 Peter 1:7</a>, and the same is the case with St <a href="/luke/17-30.htm" title="Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.">Luke 17:30</a>. But on the other hand, in passages such as <a href="/2_corinthians/12-1.htm" title="It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.">2 Corinthians 12:1</a>; <a href="/galatians/1-12.htm" title="For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.">Galatians 1:12</a>; <a href="/galatians/1-16.htm" title="To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood:">Galatians 1:16</a>; <a href="/galatians/2-2.htm" title="And I went up by revelation, and communicated to them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain.">Galatians 2:2</a>, it means (2) the fuller revelation of the mysteries of God’s kingdom; while in <a href="/revelation/1-1.htm" title="The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to him, to show to his servants things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent and signified it by his angel to his servant John:">Revelation 1:1</a>, it signifies (3) the unfolding of things to come. The second of these three meanings would seem most appropriate here. The testimony of Christ, confirmed originally by the inward witness of the Spirit, receives additional confirmation by the gradual unfolding of things Divine, until the believer, fully grounded in the faith, stands without reproach before Christ at His coming.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/1_corinthians/1.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/1_corinthians/1-7.htm" title="So that you come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ:">1 Corinthians 1:7</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ὥστε ὑμᾶς μὴ ὑστερεῖσθαι</span>, <span class="ital">So that ye are not behind</span>) This clause depends on <span class="ital">ye are enriched</span> by antithesis.—<span class="greekheb">ἀπεκδεχομένους</span>, <span class="ital">expecting</span>, [<span class="ital">waiting for</span>]) The character of the true or false Christian is either to expect or dread the revelation of Christ.
