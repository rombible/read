He thus shows that he is not blind to, or forgetful of, their good qualities, although this Epistle is specially written to rebuke their present sins; and also that he is not about to utter words of hopeless condemnation, but of wholesome warning. The emphatic use of the singular, <span class= "ital">I</span> thank <span class= "ital">my</span> God, in contrast to the plural in the previous verses, indicates that St. Paul does not join Sosthenes with him as author of the Epistle, but that it is written in his name alone and with his sole authority.<p><span class= "bld">The grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">the grace of God given you in Christ Jesus</span>—<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> given to you as being in Christ.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:1-9 All Christians are by baptism dedicated and devoted to Christ, and are under strict obligations to be holy. But in the true church of God are all who are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, and who call upon him as God manifest in the flesh, for all the blessings of salvation; who acknowledge and obey him as their Lord, and as Lord of all; it includes no other persons. Christians are distinguished from the profane and atheists, that they dare not live without prayer; and they are distinguished from Jews and pagans, that they call on the name of Christ. Observe how often in these verses the apostle repeats the words, Our Lord Jesus Christ. He feared not to make too frequent or too honourable mention of him. To all who called upon Christ, the apostle gave his usual salutation, desiring, in their behalf, the pardoning mercy, sanctifying grace, and comforting peace of God, through Jesus Christ. Sinners can have no peace with God, nor any from him, but through Christ. He gives thanks for their conversion to the faith of Christ; that grace was given them by Jesus Christ. They had been enriched by him with all spiritual gifts. He speaks of utterance and knowledge. And where God has given these two gifts, he has given great power for usefulness. These were gifts of the Holy Ghost, by which God bore witness to the apostles. Those that wait for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, will be kept by him to the end; and those that are so, will be blameless in the day of Christ, made so by rich and free grace. How glorious are the hopes of such a privilege; to be kept by the power of Christ, from the power of our corruptions and Satan's temptations!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I thank my God ... - No small part of this Epistle is occupied with reproofs for the disorders which had arisen in the church at Corinth. Before proceeding, however, to the specific statement of those disorders (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-10.htm">1 Corinthians 1:10</a> ff), the apostle commends them for the attainments which they had really made in divine knowledge, and thus shows that he was disposed to concede to them all that he could. It was no part of the disposition of Paul to withhold commendation where it was due. On the contrary, as he was disposed to be faithful in reproving the errors of Christians, he was no less disposed to commend them when it could be done; compare the note at <a href="/romans/1-8.htm">Romans 1:8</a>. A willingness to commend those who do well is as much in accordance with the gospel, as a disposition to reprove where it is deserved; and a minister, or a parent, may frequently do as decided good by judicious commendation as by reproof, and much more than by fault-finding and harsh crimination.<p>On your behalf - In respect to you; that God has conferred these favors on you.<p>For the grace of God - On account of the favors which God has bestowed on you through the Lord Jesus.

Now follows a thanksgiving for various blessings bestowed upon this church, which is a proof of the apostle's great affection for it, and how much its welfare lay at his heart. The object of thanksgiving is God, for as he is the author of all mercies, the glory and praise of them ought to be given to him. The apostle styles him "my God", to distinguish him from others; and to express his faith of interest in him; and to observe to this church, that all the good things they enjoyed came from him, who was his God and their God, his Father and their Father; and for which reason he returned thanks to him for them, and by so doing set them an example: the persons on whose behalf he gave thanks were not at this time himself and Sosthenes, but the members of the church at Corinth; and the continuance of his thankfulness for them, is "always", as often as he went to the throne of grace, or at any other time thought of them: what he particularly gives thanks to God for in this verse is, <p>for the grace which is given you by Jesus Christ: and includes all sorts of grace, adopting, justifying, pardoning, regenerating, and sanctifying grace; every particular grace of the Spirit, as faith, repentance, hope, love, fear, humility, self-denial, &amp;c. all are gifts of God, and entirely owing to his free grace, and not to man's free will and power, or to any merits of his; and all come through the hands of Christ, and are given forth by him, as the Mediator of the covenant, and in consequence of his blood, righteousness, sacrifice, and merit. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_corinthians/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{7}</span> I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ;</span><p>(7) Going about to condemn many vices, he begins with a true commendation of their virtues, lest he might seem after to descend to chiding, being moved with malice or envy: yet in such a way that he refers all to God as the author of them, and that in Christ, that the Corinthians might be more ashamed to profane and abuse the holy gifts of God.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/1_corinthians/1.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/context/1_corinthians/1-4.htm" title="I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ;...">1 Corinthians 1:4-5</a>. <span class="greekheb">Μου</span>] as in <a href="/romans/1-8.htm" title="First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.">Romans 1:8</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">πάντοτε</span>] <span class="ital">always</span>, to be measured not strictly by the literal import of the word, but by the fervour of his constant love.

This view, according to which <span class="greekheb">λόγος</span> is <span class="ital">sermo</span>, occurs in substance in the Greek commentators, in Calovius, Rückert, Neander, Hofmann, and many others, and is confirmed beyond a doubt by <a href="/2_corinthians/8-7.htm" title="Therefore, as you abound in every thing, in faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your love to us, see that you abound in this grace also.">2 Corinthians 8:7</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/11-6.htm" title="But though I be rude in speech, yet not in knowledge; but we have been thoroughly made manifest among you in all things.">2 Corinthians 11:6</a>.
