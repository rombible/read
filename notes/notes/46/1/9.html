But in the true church of God are all who are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, and who call upon him as God manifest in the flesh, for all the blessings of salvation; who acknowledge and obey him as their Lord, and as Lord of all; it includes no other persons. Christians are distinguished from the profane and atheists, that they dare not live without prayer; and they are distinguished from Jews and pagans, that they call on the name of Christ. Observe how often in these verses the apostle repeats the words, Our Lord Jesus Christ. He feared not to make too frequent or too honourable mention of him. To all who called upon Christ, the apostle gave his usual salutation, desiring, in their behalf, the pardoning mercy, sanctifying grace, and comforting peace of God, through Jesus Christ. Sinners can have no peace with God, nor any from him, but through Christ. He gives thanks for their conversion to the faith of Christ; that grace was given them by Jesus Christ. They had been enriched by him with all spiritual gifts. He speaks of utterance and knowledge. And where God has given these two gifts, he has given great power for usefulness. These were gifts of the Holy Ghost, by which God bore witness to the apostles. Those that wait for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, will be kept by him to the end; and those that are so, will be blameless in the day of Christ, made so by rich and free grace. How glorious are the hopes of such a privilege; to be kept by the power of Christ, from the power of our corruptions and Satan's temptations!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>God is faithful - That is, God is true, and constant, and will adhere to his promises. He will not deceive. He will not promise, and then fail to perform; he will not commence anything which he will not perfect and finish. The object of Paul in introducing the idea of the faithfulness of God here, is to show the reason for believing that the Christians at Corinth would be kept unto everlasting life. The evidence that they will persevere depends on the fidelity of God; and the argument of the apostle is, that as they had been called by Him into the fellowship of his Son, his faithfulness of character would render it certain that they would be kept to eternal life. The same idea he has presented in <a href="//biblehub.com/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>, "Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you, will also perform it until the day of Jesus Christ."<p>Ye were called - The word "called" here does not refer merely to "an invitation" or an "offer of life," but to the effectual influence which had been put forth; which had inclined them to embrace the gospel note at <a href="/romans/8-30.htm">Romans 8:30</a>; note at <a href="/romans/9-12.htm">Romans 9:12</a>; see <a href="/mark/2-17.htm">Mark 2:17</a>; <a href="/luke/5-32.htm">Luke 5:32</a>; <a href="/galatians/1-6.htm">Galatians 1:6</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/galatians/5-8.htm">Galatians 5:8</a>, <a href="/galatians/5-13.htm">Galatians 5:13</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-15.htm">Colossians 3:15</a>. In this sense the word often occurs in the Scriptures, and is designed to denote a power, or influence that goes forth "with" the external invitation, and that makes it effectual. That power is the agency of the Holy Spirit.<p>Unto the fellowship of his Son - To participate with his Son Jesus Christ; to be partakers with him; see the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/john/15-1.htm">John 15:1-8</a>.

This communion or fellowship with him is the necessary result of our union to him. On the saint's union to Christ, see the supplementary note at <a href="/romans/8-10.htm">Romans 8:10</a>.)<p>From all this, the argument of the apostle is, that as they partake with Christ in these high privileges, and hopes, and promises, they will be kept by a faithful God unto eternal life. God is faithful to his Son; and will be faithful to all who are united to him. The argument for the perseverance of the saints is, therefore, sure. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. faithful&#8212;to His promises (Php 1:6; 1Th 5:24).<p>called&#8212;according to His purpose (Ro 8:28).<p>unto &#8230; fellowship of &#8230; Jesus&#8212;to be fellow heirs with Christ (Ro 8:17-28), like Him sons of God and heirs of glory (Ro 8:30; 2Th 2:14; 1Pe 5:10; 1Jo 1:3).

Paul could not honestly give thanks for the actual condition of the Cor[116] Church. The reason for this omission at once appears. The Church is rent with factions, which ranged themselves under the names of the leading Christian teachers. On the causes of these divisions see <span class="ital">Introduction</span>, Chap. 1 Out of their crude and childish experience (<a href="/context/1_corinthians/3-1.htm" title="And I, brothers, could not speak to you as to spiritual, but as to carnal, even as to babes in Christ....">1 Corinthians 3:1-4</a>) the Cor[117] are constructing prematurely a <span class="greekheb">γνῶσις</span> of their own (<a href="/1_corinthians/8-1.htm" title="Now as touching things offered to idols, we know that we all have knowledge.

The four chapters constitute an <span class="ital">apologia</span> for the Apostle’s teaching and office, parl[119] to those of 2 Corinthians 10-13 and Galatians 1-3; but the line of defence adopted here is quite distinct. Here Paul pleads against Hellenising lovers of wisdom, there against Judaising lovers of tradition. Both parties stumbled at the cross; both judged of the Ap. <span class="greekheb">κατὰ σάρκα</span>, and fastened upon his defects in visible prestige and presence. The existence of the legalist party at Cor[120] is intimated by the cry, “I am of Cephas,” and by Paul’s words of self-vindication in <a href="/1_corinthians/9-1.htm" title="Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are not you my work in the Lord?">1 Corinthians 9:1</a> f.; but this faction had as yet reached no considerable head; it developed rapidly in the interval between 1 and 2 Cor.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[116] Corinth, Corinthian or Corinthians.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[117] Corinth, Corinthian or Corinthians.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[118] Corinth, Corinthian or Corinthians.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[119] parallel.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[120] Corinth, Corinthian or Corinthians.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/1_corinthians/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">9</span>. <span class="ital">God is faithful</span>] It will not be God’s fault, but our own, if the promises of the last verse are not realized.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ</span>] The important word here rendered <span class="ital">fellowship</span> has unfortunately different renderings in our version.

Its usual signification would appear to be the <span class="ital">sharing together, joint participation</span> as common possessors of any thing. But it is impossible to go so far as Cremer in his Lexicon of the N.
