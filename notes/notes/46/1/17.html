For the evidence and efficacy of the gospel arise not from its being proved by philosophical arguments, and recommended by the charms of human eloquence, but from its being proved by miracles, and founded on the testimony of God.” — Macknight.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:17-25 Paul had been bred up in Jewish learning; but the plain preaching of a crucified Jesus, was more powerful than all the oratory and philosophy of the heathen world. This is the sum and substance of the gospel. Christ crucified is the foundation of all our hopes, the fountain of all our joys. And by his death we live. The preaching of salvation for lost sinners by the sufferings and death of the Son of God, if explained and faithfully applied, appears foolishness to those in the way to destruction. The sensual, the covetous, the proud, and ambitious, alike see that the gospel opposes their favourite pursuits. But those who receive the gospel, and are enlightened by the Spirit of God, see more of God's wisdom and power in the doctrine of Christ crucified, than in all his other works. God left a great part of the world to follow the dictates of man's boasted reason, and the event has shown that human wisdom is folly, and is unable to find or retain the knowledge of God as the Creator. It pleased him, by the foolishness of preaching, to save them that believe. By the foolishness of preaching; not by what could justly be called foolish preaching. But the thing preached was foolishness to wordly-wise men. The gospel ever was, and ever will be, foolishness to all in the road to destruction. The message of Christ, plainly delivered, ever has been a sure touchstone by which men may learn what road they are travelling. But the despised doctrine of salvation by faith in a crucified Saviour, God in human nature, purchasing the church with his own blood, to save multitudes, even all that believe, from ignorance, delusion, and vice, has been blessed in every age. And the weakest instruments God uses, are stronger in their effects, than the strongest men can use. Not that there is foolishness or weakness in God, but what men consider as such, overcomes all their admired wisdom and strength.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For Christ sent me not to baptize - That is, not to baptize as my main business. Baptism was not his principal employment, though be had a commission in common with others to administer the ordinance, and occasionally did it. The same thing was true of the Saviour, that he did not personally baptize, <a href="/john/4-2.htm">John 4:2</a>. It is probable that the business of baptism was entrusted to the ministers of the church of inferior talents, or to those who were connected with the churches permanently, and not to those who were engaged chiefly in traveling from place to place. The reasons of this may have been:<p>(1) That which Paul here suggests, that if the apostles had themselves baptized, it might have given occasion to strifes, and the formation of parties, as those who had been baptized by the apostles might claim some superiority over those who were not.<p>(2) it is probable that the rite of baptism was preceded or followed by a course of instruction adapted to it, and as the apostles were traveling from place to place, this could be better entrusted to those who were to be with them as their ordinary religious teachers. It was an advantage that those who imparted this instruction should also administer this ordinance.<p>(3) it is not improbable, as Doddridge supposes, that the administration of this ordinance was entrusted to inferiors, because it was commonly practiced by immersion, and was attended with some trouble and inconvenience, while the time of the apostles might be more directly occupied in their main work.<p>But to preach the gospel - As his main business; as the leading, grand purpose of his ministry. This is the grand object of all ministers. It is not to build up a sect or party; it is not to secure simply the baptism of people in this or that communion; it is to make known the glad tidings of salvation, and call people to repentance and to God.<p>Not with wisdom of words - (&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#837; &#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;  ouk en sophia logou). Not in wisdom of speech, margin. The expression here is a Hebraism, or a form of speech common in the Hebrew writings, where a noun is used to express the meaning of an adjective, and means "not in wise words or discourse." The wisdom mentioned here, refers, doubtless, to that which was common among the Greeks, and which was so highly valued. It included the following things:<p>(1) Their subtle and learned mode of disputation, or that which was practiced in their schools of philosophy.<p>(2) a graceful and winning eloquence; the arts by which they sought to commend their sentiments, and to win others to their opinions. On this also the Greek rhetoricians greatly valued themselves, and this, probably, the false teachers endeavored to imitate.<p>(3) that which is elegant and finished in literature, in style and composition. On this the Greeks greatly valued themselves, as the Jews did on miracles and wonders; compare <a href="/1_corinthians/1-22.htm">1 Corinthians 1:22</a>. The apostle means to say, that the success of the gospel did not depend on these things; that he had not sought them; nor had he exhibited them in his preaching. His doctrine and his manner had not been such as to appear wise to the Greeks; and he had not depended on eloquence or philosophy for his success. Longinus (on the Sublime) enumerates Paul among people distinguished for eloquence; but it is probable that he was not distinguished for the graces of manner (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-1.htm">2 Corinthians 10:1</a>, <a href="/2_corinthians/10-10.htm">2 Corinthians 10:10</a>), so much as the strength and power of his reasoning.<p>Paul here introduces a new subject of discourse, which he pursues through this and the two following chapters - the effect of philosophy on the gospel, or the estimate which ought to be formed in regard to it. The reasons why he introduces this topic, and dwells upon it at such a length, are not perfectly apparent. They are supposed to have been the following:<p>(1) He had incidentally mentioned his own preaching, and his having been set apart particularly to that; <a href="/1_corinthians/1-17.htm">1 Corinthians 1:17</a>.<p>(2) his authority, it is probable, had been called in question by the false teachers at Corinth.<p>(3) the ground of this, or the reason why they undervalued him, had been probably, that he had not, evinced the eloquence of manner and the graces of oratory on which they so much valued themselves.<p>(4) they had depended for their success on captivating the Greeks by the charms of graceful rhetoric and the refinements of subtle argumentation.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17. Paul says this not to depreciate baptism; for he exalts it most highly (Ro 6:3).

It is hard to conceive how three thousand should in a day be added to the church, if Peter had baptized them all, <span class="bld"><a href="/acts/2-41.htm" title="Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added to them about three thousand souls.">Acts 2:41</a></span>.

This was the way (he saith) to have taken away all authority from the doctrine of the cross of Christ: Divine faith being nothing else but the soul’s assent to the Divine revelation because it is such, is not furthered, but hindered, by the arguing the object of it from the principles of reason, and the colouring of it with high-flown words and trim phrases. There is a decent expression to be used in the communicating the will of God unto men; but we must take heed that we do not diminish the authority of God’s revealed will, either by puerile flourishings of words, or philosophical argumentation. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_corinthians/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For Christ sent me not to baptize,.... Some think the apostle refers to his particular mission from Christ, <a href="/acts/26-16.htm">Acts 26:16</a> in which no mention is made of his administering the ordinance of baptism; but no doubt he had the same mission the rest of the apostles had, which was to baptize as well as preach; and indeed, if he had not been sent at all to baptize, it would have been unlawful for him to have administered baptism to any person whatever; but his sense is, that baptism was not the chief and principal business he was sent about; this was to be done mostly by those preachers of the word who travelled with him, or followed after him: he was not sent so much about this work, <p>but to preach the Gospel; for which he was most eminently qualified, had peculiar gifts for the discharge of it, and was greatly useful in it. This was what he was rather sent to do than the other, and this "not with wisdom of words". Scholastic divinity, or the art of disputation, is by the (f) Karaites, a sect among the Jews, called , "wisdom of words": this the apostle seems to refer to, and signifies he was not sent with, or to preach, with words of man's wisdom, with human eloquence and oratory, with great swelling words of vanity, but in a plain, humble, modest manner; on which account the false teachers despised him, and endeavoured to bring his ministry into contempt with others: but this way and manner of preaching he chose for this reason, <p>lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect; that is, either lest men's ears and fancies should be so tickled and pleased with the eloquence of speech, the elegancy of diction, and accuracy of expression, the cadency of words, and beauty of the oration, with the manner, and not with the matter of preaching, and so the true use, end, and design of the doctrine of a crucified Christ be defeated; or lest the success of the ministry should be attributed to the force of enticing words, and the strength and persuasion of oratory, and not to the energy of divine power attending the doctrine of the cross, <p>(f) Sepher Cosri Orat. 5.

And so he declared sufficiently how far he was from all ambition: whereas on the other hand they, whom he reprehends, as though they gathered disciples to themselves and not to Christ, bragged most ambitiously of numbers, which they had baptized.<p>(20) Now he turns himself to the teachers themselves, who pleased themselves in brave and glory-seeking eloquence, to the end that they might draw more disciples after them. He openly confesses that he was not similar to them, opposing gravely, as it became an apostle, his example against their perverse judgments: so that this is another place in this epistle with regard to the observing of a godly simplicity both in words and sentences in teaching the Gospel.<p>(l) With eloquence: which Paul casts off from himself not only as unnecessary, but also as completely contrary to the office of his apostleship: and yet Paul had this kind of eloquence, but it was heavenly, not of man, and void of fancy words.<p>(21) The reason why he did not use the pomp of words and fancy speech: because it was God's will to bring the world to his obedience by that way, by which the most foolish among men might understand that this work was done by God himself, without the skill of man. Therefore as salvation is set forth to us in the Gospel by the cross of Christ, which nothing is more contemptible than, and more far from life, so God would have the manner of the preaching of the cross, most different from those means with which men do use to draw and entice others, either to hear or believe: therefore it pleased him by a certain kind of most wise folly, to triumph over the most foolish wisdom of the world, as he had said before by Isaiah that he would. And by this we may gather that both these teachers who were puffed up with ambitious eloquence, and also their hearers, strayed far away from the goal and mark of their calling.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/1_corinthians/1.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/1_corinthians/1-17.htm" title="For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect.">1 Corinthians 1:17</a>.

[E. T. 296 f.]: <span class="ital">to preach without wisdom, of speech</span>, without the discourse having a philosophic character,—as desired by the Hellenic taste. We are not to apply this, however, to the philosophic <span class="ital">contents</span> of the teaching (Storr, Rosenmüller, Flatt, and others), but to the <span class="ital">form</span>, which consists in the clothing of the doctrine in philosophic garb, in speculative skill, argumentative reasoning, illustration, elaboration of the matter, and the like, together with the effect which this, from the nature of the case, may have upon the doctrine itself. For it followed as a matter of course from Paul’s being sent <span class="ital">by Christ</span>, that he was not to preach a <span class="ital">doctrine</span> of this world’s wisdom (as did Plato, Aristotle, the Sophists, etc.); what he had to do was to deliver the substance of the <span class="greekheb">εὐαγγελίζεσθαι</span>—which is in truth <span class="ital">given</span> for all cases alike—without casting it in any philosophic <span class="ital">mould</span>; his <span class="ital">speech</span> was not to be <span class="greekheb">ἐν σοφίᾳ</span>, lest its <span class="ital">substance</span> should lose its essential character. This <span class="ital">substance</span> was the crucified Christ, about whom he had to preach, not in the style and mode of presentation used by the wisdom of this world,—not in such a way that his preaching would have been the setting forth of a Christian philosophy of religion. Even the <span class="ital">dialectic</span> element in Paul’s discourses widely differs from anything of this sort.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἵνα μὴ κενωθῇ <span class="bld"><span class="ital">Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span></span></span>[213]] aim of the <span class="greekheb">εὐαγγ</span>. <span class="greekheb">οὐκ ἐν σοφ</span>. <span class="greekheb">λ</span>.: <span class="ital">in order that the cross of Christ might not be emptied</span> (comp <a href="/romans/4-14.htm" title="For if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect:">Romans 4:14</a>) <span class="ital">of its essence divinely effectual for salvation</span> (<a href="/romans/1-16.htm" title="For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God to salvation to every one that believes; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.">Romans 1:16</a>). <span class="ital">The cross of Christ</span>—that Christ was crucified (and thereby won salvation for us),—this fact alone was the pure main <span class="ital">substance</span> (“nucleus et medulla,” Calovius) of the apostolic preaching, and as such has the essential quality of proving itself in all believers the saving power of God, and of thereby, in the way of inward living experience, bringing to nought all human wisdom (<a href="/context/1_corinthians/1-18.htm" title="For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but to us which are saved it is the power of God....">1 Corinthians 1:18-19</a> ff.). Now, had the cross of Christ been preached <span class="greekheb">ἐν σοφιᾳ λόγου</span>, it would have been emptied of its divine and essential power to bless, since it would then have made common cause with man’s wisdom, and therefore, instead of overthrowing the latter, would have exalted it and made it come, totally alien in nature as it was, in place of itself.

To use “wisdom of word” in meeting such antagonism would have been for P. to fight the world with its own weapons and to betray his cause, the strength of which lay in the Divine power and wisdom embodied in Christ, a force destined, because it was God’s, to bring to shame the world’s vaunting wisdom (<a href="/context/1_corinthians/1-19.htm" title="For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent....">1 Corinthians 1:19-25</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[189] Corinth, Corinthian or Corinthians.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/1_corinthians/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">17</span>. <span class="ital">For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel</span>] “Even the less earned can baptize perfectly, but perfectly to preach the Gospel is a far more difficult task, and requires qualifications which are far more rare.”—Augustine.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">not with wisdom of words</span>] Rather <span class="ital">discourse</span>, as in <span class="ital"><a href="/1_corinthians/1-5.htm" title="That in every thing you are enriched by him, in all utterance, and in all knowledge;">1 Corinthians 1:5</a></span>.
