In the gospel, many truths, before hidden in mystery, are made known. Death never shall appear in the regions to which our Lord will bear his risen saints. Therefore let us seek the full assurance of faith and hope, that in the midst of pain, and in the prospect of death, we may think calmly on the horrors of the tomb; assured that our bodies will there sleep, and in the mean time our souls will be present with the Redeemer. Sin gives death all its hurtful power. The sting of death is sin; but Christ, by dying, has taken out this sting; he has made atonement for sin, he has obtained remission of it. The strength of sin is the law. None can answer its demands, endure its curse, or do away his own transgressions. Hence terror and anguish. And hence death is terrible to the unbelieving and the impenitent. Death may seize a believer, but it cannot hold him in its power. How many springs of joy to the saints, and of thanksgiving to God, are opened by the death and resurrection, the sufferings and conquests of the Redeemer! In verse 58, we have an exhortation, that believers should be stedfast, firm in the faith of that gospel which the apostle preached, and they received. Also, to be unmovable in their hope and expectation of this great privilege, of being raised incorruptible and immortal. And to abound in the work of the Lord, always doing the Lord's service, and obeying the Lord's commands. May Christ give us faith, and increase our faith, that we may not only be safe, but joyful and triumphant.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>So when ... - In that future glorious world, when all this shall have been accomplished.<p>Then shall be brought to pass - Then shall be fully accomplished; these words shall then receive their entire fulfillment; or this event shall meet all that is implied in these words.<p>The saying that is written - What is written, or the record which is made.

The destruction of the “last enemy” secures absolute “victory” for Christ and His own. Paul corrects the LXX txt. of <a href="/isaiah/25-8.htm" title="He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord GOD will wipe away tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all the earth: for the LORD has spoken it.">Isaiah 25:8</a>, which makes Death the victor,—<span class="greekheb">κατέπιεν ὁ θάνατος ἰσχύσας</span>; he appears to have read the Heb. passively <span class="ital">bulla</span>‘, for Massoretic <span class="ital">billa</span>‘: Theodotion’s translation is identical with Paul’s. <span class="ital">lanetsach</span> (<span class="ital">for ever</span>) is often rendered <span class="greekheb">εἰς νῖκος</span> (later Gr[2573] form of <span class="greekheb">νίκη</span>) by the LXX, according to the Aramaic sense of the noun; its Heb. sense implies a final and unqualified overthrow of the King of Terrors, and therefore admits of P.’s application. “This is the farthest reaching of all O.T. prophecies; it bears allusion to Genesis 3” (Dillmann; see also Delitzsch, on the Isaianic txt.), and reverses the doom there pronounced.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[2571] verb<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[2572] parallel.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[2573] Greek, or Grotius’ <span class="ital">Annotationes in N.T.</span><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/1_corinthians/15.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">54</span>. <span class="ital">Death is swallowed up in victory</span>] The English version translates <a href="/isaiah/25-8.htm" title="He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord GOD will wipe away tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all the earth: for the LORD has spoken it.">Isaiah 25:8</a>, the passage here quoted, by ‘He will swallow up death in victory.’ But the literal meaning of the word so translated is ‘for ever,’ and the Vulgate here renders ‘in sempiternum,’ though the Septuagint frequently, but not here, renders it by <span class="ital">victory</span>, following the analogy of the Syriac and Chaldee, where a kindred word signifies victory. The verb also is in the perfect tense in the Hebrew, as speaking of the fixed purpose of God, and is here rendered by the aorist, and thus referred to the Death and Resurrection of Christ, in which, by ‘the determinate purpose and foreknowledge of God,’ death ‘was swallowed up unto victory.’<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/1_corinthians/15.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/1_corinthians/15-54.htm" title="So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.">1 Corinthians 15:54</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ὅταν δὲ</span>—<span class="greekheb">ἀθανασίαν</span>, <span class="ital">but when—immortality</span>) The frequent repetition of these words is very delightful.—<span class="greekheb">τότε</span>, <span class="ital">then</span>) not before.
