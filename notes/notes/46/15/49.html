The words transport the thoughts of the reader to the future glory, and, at the same moment, show a light on present duty. The resurrection life is to be begun in us even now. “If by any means we can attain to the resurrection of the dead” (<a href="/2_corinthians/3-18.htm" title="But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the LORD.">2Corinthians 3:18</a>; <a href="/philippians/3-21.htm" title="Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like to his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things to himself.">Philippians 3:21</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/15.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>15:35-50 1. How are the dead raised up? that is, by what means? How can they be raised? 2. As to the bodies which shall rise. Will it be with the like shape, and form, and stature, and members, and qualities? The former objection is that of those who opposed the doctrine, the latter of curious doubters. To the first the answer is, This was to be brought about by Divine power; that power which all may see does somewhat like it, year after year, in the death and revival of the corn. It is foolish to question the Almighty power of God to raise the dead, when we see it every day quickening and reviving things that are dead. To the second inquiry; The grain undergoes a great change; and so will the dead, when they rise and live again. The seed dies, though a part of it springs into new life, though how it is we cannot fully understand. The works of creation and providence daily teach us to be humble, as well as to admire the Creator's wisdom and goodness. There is a great variety among other bodies, as there is among plants. There is a variety of glory among heavenly bodies. The bodies of the dead, when they rise, will be fitted for the heavenly bodies. The bodies of the dead, when they rise, will be fitted for the heavenly state; and there will be a variety of glories among them. Burying the dead, is like committing seed to the earth, that it may spring out of it again. Nothing is more loathsome than a dead body. But believers shall at the resurrection have bodies, made fit to be for ever united with spirits made perfect. To God all things are possible. He is the Author and Source of spiritual life and holiness, unto all his people, by the supply of his Holy Spirit to the soul; and he will also quicken and change the body by his Spirit. The dead in Christ shall not only rise, but shall rise thus gloriously changed. The bodies of the saints, when they rise again, will be changed. They will be then glorious and spiritual bodies, fitted to the heavenly world and state, where they are ever afterwards to dwell. The human body in its present form, and with its wants and weaknesses, cannot enter or enjoy the kingdom of God. Then let us not sow to the flesh, of which we can only reap corruption. And the body follows the state of the soul. He, therefore, who neglects the life of the soul, casts away his present good; he who refuses to live to God, squanders all he has.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And as we have borne the image of the earthy - As like our first father, we are frail, decaying, dying; as we are so closely connected with him as to be like him. This does not refer, mainly, to one bearing his moral character, but to the fact that we are, like him, subject to sickness, frailty, sorrow, and death.<p>We shall also bear the image of the heavenly - The Lord Jesus Christ, who was from heaven, and who is in heaven. As we are so closely connected with Adam as to resemble him. so by the divine arrangement, and by faith in the Lord Jesus, we are so closely connected with him that we shall resemble him in heaven. And as he is now free from frailty, sickness. pain, sorrow, and death, and as he has a pure and spiritual body, adapted to a residence in heaven, so shall we be in that future world. The argument here is, that the connection which is formed between the believer and the Saviour is as close as that which subsisted between him and Adam; and as that connection with Adam involved the certainty that he would be subjected to pain, sin, sickness, and death, so the connection with Christ involves the certainty that he will like him be free from sin, sickness, pain, and death, and like him will have a body that is pure, incorruptible, and immortal. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>49. as&#8212;Greek, "even as" (see Ge 5:3).<p>we shall also bear&#8212;or wear as a garment [Bengel].

Beza says well, in opposition to the reading <span class="greekheb">φορέσωμεν</span> and its interpretation: “Hoc plane est detortum, quum res ipsa clamet, Paulum in proposito argumento pergere.” What, namely, was already contained in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-48.htm" title="As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.">1 Corinthians 15:48</a>, he now expresses in a yet more definite and concrete way (hence, too, passing over into the first person), bringing out with much emphasis the full meaning of the weighty statement, thus: <span class="ital">And as we have borne</span> (before the Parousia) <span class="ital">the image of the earthly</span> (of Adam),—<span class="ital">i.e.</span> the psychical body which makes us appear as like in kind to Adam,—<span class="ital">so shall we</span> (after the Parousia) <span class="ital">bear also the image of the heavenly</span> (of Christ), <span class="ital">i.e.</span> the pneumatic body.

And, moreover, the exhortation would seem a little out of place, since “regeneration cannot be obtained by striving or even by faith itself, it is an act of positive grace.” Olshausen. Tertullian, however, remarks expressly that St Paul says ‘let us bear,’ speaking in exhortation, not in doctrine. So Chrysostom, whom—with the Vulgate—Wiclif follows, translating “<span class="ital">bere we also</span>;” while Theodoret, on the contrary, says that St Paul here was not speaking hortatively, but prophetically.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/1_corinthians/15.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/1_corinthians/15-49.htm" title="And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.">1 Corinthians 15:49</a>. <span class="greekheb">Καὶ καθὼς</span>, <span class="ital">and even as</span>) From the former state Paul infers the latter.—<span class="greekheb">ἐφορέσαμεν</span>, <span class="ital">we have borne</span> [<span class="ital">worn</span>]) as a garment.—<span class="greekheb">τὴν εἰκόνα</span>, <span class="ital">the image</span>) This not only denotes the resemblance, but also the dependence.—<span class="greekheb">φορέσωμεν καὶ τὴν εἰκόνα τοῦ ἐπουρανίου</span>, <span class="ital">let us bear</span> [<span class="ital">wear</span>] <span class="ital">also the image of the heavenly</span>) Tertullian says: <span class="ital">Let us bear; not we shall bear, preceptively, not promissively</span>. Nay, <span class="greekheb">φορέσωμεν</span>, <span class="ital">let us bear</span>, and yet in the way of promise.[145] The subjunctive renders the expression modal and conciliatory, by which Paul (comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/15-53.htm" title="For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.">1 Corinthians 15:53</a>, <span class="ital">must</span>) expresses the divine appointment and faith assenting to it.
