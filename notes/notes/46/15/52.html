In the gospel, many truths, before hidden in mystery, are made known. Death never shall appear in the regions to which our Lord will bear his risen saints. Therefore let us seek the full assurance of faith and hope, that in the midst of pain, and in the prospect of death, we may think calmly on the horrors of the tomb; assured that our bodies will there sleep, and in the mean time our souls will be present with the Redeemer. Sin gives death all its hurtful power. The sting of death is sin; but Christ, by dying, has taken out this sting; he has made atonement for sin, he has obtained remission of it. The strength of sin is the law. None can answer its demands, endure its curse, or do away his own transgressions. Hence terror and anguish. And hence death is terrible to the unbelieving and the impenitent. Death may seize a believer, but it cannot hold him in its power. How many springs of joy to the saints, and of thanksgiving to God, are opened by the death and resurrection, the sufferings and conquests of the Redeemer! In verse 58, we have an exhortation, that believers should be stedfast, firm in the faith of that gospel which the apostle preached, and they received. Also, to be unmovable in their hope and expectation of this great privilege, of being raised incorruptible and immortal. And to abound in the work of the Lord, always doing the Lord's service, and obeying the Lord's commands. May Christ give us faith, and increase our faith, that we may not only be safe, but joyful and triumphant.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In a moment - (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#837;  en atomo&#772;).

Or the Spirit by Paul hints that the other trumpets mentioned subsequently in the Apocalypse shall precede, and that this shall be the last of all (compare Isa 27:13; Zec 9:14). As the law was given with the sound of a trumpet, so the final judgment according to it (Heb 12:19; compare Ex 19:16). As the Lord ascended "with the sound of a trumpet" (Ps 47:5), so He shall descend (Re 11:15). The trumpet was sounded to convoke the people on solemn feasts, especially on the first day of the seventh month (the type of the completion of time; seven being the number for perfection; on the tenth of the same month was the atonement, and on the fifteenth the feast of tabernacles, commemorative of completed salvation out of the spiritual Egypt, compare Zec 14:18, 19); compare Ps 50:1-7. Compare His calling forth of Lazarus from the grave "with a loud voice," Joh 11:43, with Joh 5:25, 28.<p>and&#8212;immediately, in consequence.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_corinthians/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This change will be on the sudden, <span class="bld">in a moment; </span> either upon the will and command of Christ, which shall be as effectual to call persons out of their graves, as a trumpet is to call persons together; or rather, upon a sound made like to the sound of a trumpet, as it was at the giving of the law upon Sinai, <span class="bld"><a href="/exodus/19-16.htm" title="And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightning, and a thick cloud on the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that was in the camp trembled.">Exodus 19:16</a></span>.

There shall (saith the apostle) be such a sound made; and upon the making of it, the saints, that are dead, shall be raised out of their graves; not with such bodies as they carried thither, (which were corruptible), but with such bodies as shall be no more subject to corruption; and those who at that time shall be alive, shall one way or another be <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">changed, </span> and be also put into an incorruptible state. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_corinthians/15.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>In a moment,.... Or point of time, which is very short indeed; what a moment is, according to the Jewish doctors,  See Gill on <a href="/matthew/4-8.htm">Matthew 4:8</a>. <p>In the twinkling of an eye; these two the Jews not only put together as here, but make one to be as the other; so they say (k),  , "a moment is as the twinkling of an eye". This phrase, as the twinkling of an eye, is frequently used in Jewish writings (l), to signify how speedily ard suddenly anything is done, and which is the design of it here; and the apostle's meaning is, that the change upon the bodies of living saints will be so quick, that it will be done in a trice, before a man can shut his eyes and open them again; so that it will be as it were imperceptible, and without the least sensation of pain; this may also be referred to the resurrection, which will be quick, and done at once; though it seems rather, and chiefly, to respect the change of the living; what follows, indeed, favours the other sense also; for all will be quick and sudden, the coming of Christ, the raising of the dead, and the change of the living: <p>at the last trumpet, for the trumpet shall sound; or "by the last trumpet", as the Syriac and Arabic versions render it; that is, by means of it, through the sounding of that: <p>and the dead shall be raised incorruptible; free from all frailty, mortality, and corruption, when the trumpet shall sound: <p>and at the same time also, <p>we shall be changed; the saints that will be found alive; the apostle speaks in the first person, because of the uncertainty of Christ's coming, and of the blowing of the last trumpet, he not knowing but it might be in his time; what this last trumpet will be, is not easy to say; it can hardly be thought to be a material one: the Jews (m) have a notion, that a trumpet will be blown at the time of the resurrection of the dead, as at the giving of the law on Mount Sinai; which will quicken the dead, as they say it then did; and that this will be blown by Michael the archangel (n): it seems very likely to be the same with the shout, the voice of the archangel, and the trumpet of God, <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:16</a> all which may be no other than the voice of Christ; at the hearing of which, the dead will rise; but whether this will be an articulate one, as at the raising of Lazarus, or is only expressive of his power, which will then be put forth, is not material, nor a point to be determined: and what if by all this should be meant some violent claps of thunder, as at Mount Sinai, which will shake the whole earth; and when almighty power will be put forth to raise the dead: since such are by the Jews (o) called the voices of the son of David, and are expected by them, a little before his coming? This is called the "last" trumpet, not so much with respect to those that go before, much less to the seven trumpets in the Revelations, of which as yet there was no revelation made, but because there will be none after it; see: <p>"And the trumpet shall give a sound, which when every man heareth, they shall be suddenly afraid.''

Paul might also have written: <span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ</span> … <span class="greekheb">σάλπιγγος</span>, Polyb. iv. 13. 1. Regarding the subject-matter, comp. <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm" title="For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:">1 Thessalonians 4:16</a>, and Lünemann and Ewald on that passage. The <span class="ital">last</span> trumpet is <span class="ital">that sounding at the final moment of this age of the world</span>. It does not conflict with this statement, if we suppose that Paul conceived the second resurrection also (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-24.htm" title="Then comes the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power.">1 Corinthians 15:24</a>) to take place with trumpet-sound, for <span class="greekheb">ἐσχ</span>. has its temporal reference in <span class="greekheb">αἰὼν οὗτος</span>. De Wette (so, too, in the form of a suggestion, Vatablus; and comp. previously, Theodoret of Mopsuestia) thinks of the <span class="ital">last among several</span> trumpet-<span class="ital">signals</span>, against which, however, is the simple, not more precisely defined <span class="greekheb">σαλπίσει γάρ</span> which follows. This, too, in opposition to Osiander, van Hengel, Maier, and Hofmann. To understand, with Olshausen, who follows older expositors (<span class="greekheb">τινές</span> even already in Theophylact), the <span class="ital">seventh</span> trumpet, <a href="/revelation/8-9.htm" title="And the third part of the creatures which were in the sea, and had life, died; and the third part of the ships were destroyed.">Revelation 8:9</a>, with which, along with the trumpets of Jericho, Hofmann also compares it, is to place it on the same level with the visions of the Revelation, for doing which we have no ground, since in 1 Thess. too, <span class="ital">l.c.</span>, only one trumpet is mentioned, and that one taken for granted as well known. It is true that the Rabbins also taught that God will sound the trumpet <span class="ital">seven times</span>, and that in such a way that the resurrection will develope itself in seven acts;[94] but this conception, too, was foreign to the apostle, seeing that he represents the rising as an <span class="ital">instantaneous</span> event without breaks of development. It may be added, that the <span class="ital">trumpet</span> of the Parousia (see, already, <a href="/matthew/24-31.htm" title="And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.">Matthew 24:31</a>) is not to be explained away, either with Wolf and others: “cum signa apparebunt judicii jam celebrandi,” or, with Olshausen (comp. Maier), of a startling <span class="ital">work of the Spirit</span>, arousing mankind for a great end. Comp., too, Theophylact, who understands by the <span class="greekheb">σάλπιγξ</span> the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΈΛΕΥΣΜΑ</span></span></span> and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΝΕῦΜΑ</span></span></span> of God <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤῸ ΔΙᾺ ΠΆΝΤΩΝ ΦΘΆΝΟΝ</span></span></span>; as in substance also Usteri, p. 356, Billroth, Neander, Hofmann.[95] As regards the phrase in itself, we might compare the Homeric <span class="greekheb">ἀμφὶ δὲ σάλπιγξεν μέγας οὐρανός</span>, <span class="ital">Il.</span> xxi. 388, where the <span class="ital">thunder</span> (as signal for the onset) is meant. But the connection gives us no right whatever to assume a non-literal, imaginative representation. On the contrary, Paul has in fact carried with him the conception of the resurrection-<span class="ital">trumpet</span> (resting upon <a href="/exodus/19-16.htm" title="And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightning, and a thick cloud on the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that was in the camp trembled.">Exodus 19:16</a>) from the popular sphere of conception, attested also in Matt. <span class="ital">l.c.</span> (comp. 4 Esdr. 6:24), into his Christian sphere,[96] as he then himself adds forthwith by way of confirmation and with solemn emphasis: <span class="greekheb">σαλπίσει γὰρ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.] <span class="ital">for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead</span> (the Christians who have already died up to that time) <span class="ital">shall be raised incorruptible, and we</span> (who are still alive then) <span class="ital">shall be changed</span>. The <span class="ital">paratactic</span> expression (instead of <span class="greekheb">ὅτε γάρ</span>, or some other such form of subordination) should of itself have been sufficient to prevent the divesting the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣΑΛΠ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΓΆΡ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> of its emphasis by regarding it simply as an introduction to what follows in connection with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ Τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἘΣΧ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΣΆΛΠ</span></span></span>.
