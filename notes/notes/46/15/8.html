Of the apostle's doctrine not a trace can be found in all the teaching of philosophers. The doctrine of Christ's death and resurrection, is the foundation of Christianity. Remove this, and all our hopes for eternity sink at once. And it is by holding this truth firm, that Christians stand in the day of trial, and are kept faithful to God. We believe in vain, unless we keep in the faith of the gospel. This truth is confirmed by Old Testament prophecies; and many saw Christ after he was risen. This apostle was highly favoured, but he always had a low opinion of himself, and expressed it. When sinners are, by Divine grace, turned into saints, God causes the remembrance of former sins to make them humble, diligent, and faithful. He ascribes to Divine grace all that was valuable in him. True believers, though not ignorant of what the Lord has done for, in, and by them, yet when they look at their whole conduct and their obligations, they are led to feel that none are so worthless as they are. All true Christians believe that Jesus Christ, and him crucified, and then risen from the dead, is the sun and substance of Christianity. All the apostles agreed in this testimony; by this faith they lived, and in this faith they died.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And last of all - After all the other times in which he appeared to people; after he had ascended to heaven. This passage proves that the apostle Paul saw the same Lord Jesus, the same "body" which had been seen by the others, or else his assertion would be no proof that he was risen from the dead. It was not a fancy, therefore, that he had seen him; it was not the work of imagination; it was not even a "revelation" that he had risen; it was a real vision of the ascended Redeemer.<p>He was seen of me also - On the way to Damascus, see <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/9-3.htm">Acts 9:3-6</a>, <a href="/acts/9-17.htm">Acts 9:17</a>.<p>As of one born out of due time - Margin, Or, "an abortive." Our translation, to most readers, probably, would not convey the real meaning of this place. The expression, "as of one born out of due time," would seem to imply that Paul meant to say that there was some unfitness "as to the time" when he saw the Lord Jesus; or that it was "too late" to have as clear and satisfactory a view of him as those had who saw him before his ascension. But this is by no means the idea in the passage. The word used here (&#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;  ektro&#772;ma) properly means an abortion, one born prematurely. It is found no where else in the New Testament; and here it means, as the following verse shows, one that was "exceedingly unworthy;" that was not worth regard; that was unfit to be employed in the service of the Lord Jesus; that had the same relation to that which was worthy of the apostolic office which an abortion has to a living child. The word occurs (in the Septuagint) in <a href="/job/3-16.htm">Job 3:16</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/6-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:3</a>, as the translation of &#1504;&#1508;&#1500;  nephel, an abortion, or untimely birth. The expression seems to be proverbial, and to denote anything that is vile, offensive, loathsome, unworthy; see <a href="/numbers/12-11.htm">Numbers 12:11</a>. The word, I think, has no reference to the mode of "training" of the apostle, as if he had not had the same opportunity as the others had, and was therefore, compared with their advantages, like an untimely child compared with one that had come to maturity before its birth, as Bloomfield supposes; nor does it refer to his diminutive stature, as Wetstein supposes; but it means that he felt himself "vile," guilty, unworthy, abominable as a persecutor, and as unworthy to be an apostle. The verse following shows that this is the sense in which the word is used. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. One born out of due time&#8212;Greek, "the one abortively born": the abortion in the family of the apostles. As a child born before the due time is puny, and though born alive, yet not of the proper size, and scarcely worthy of the name of man, so "I am the least of the apostles," scarcely "meet to be called an apostle"; a supernumerary taken into the college of apostles out of regular course, not led to Christ by long instruction, like a natural birth, but by a sudden power, as those prematurely born [Grotius]. Compare the similar image from childbirth, and by the same spiritual power, the resurrection of Christ (1Pe 1:3). "Begotten again by the resurrection of Jesus." Jesus' appearance to Paul, on the way to Damascus, is the one here referred to.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_corinthians/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Last of all</span> the apostles, or, it may be, last of all persons; for after Stephen we read of none but St. Paul who saw Christ. Stephen, as they were stoning him, cried out: <span class="ital">Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="/acts/7-56.htm" title="And said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God.">Acts 7:56</a></span>.

Nor is it any objection against it, that he was struck blind, for that was after his sight of Christ, not before. He calls himself an abortive, or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">one born out of due time, </span> either because he was added to the number of the twelve; or in respect to his new birth, he being converted (as he tells us afterward) after that he had been a persecutor of the church of Christ, after the descending of the Holy Ghost; or, it may be, because his conversion was sudden, like the abortive birth of a woman. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_corinthians/15.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And last of all he was seen of me also,.... Either when the apostle was caught up into the third heaven; or when he was in a trance in the temple at Jerusalem; or rather at the time of his conversion, when he not only heard the voice of Christ, but saw him in the human nature; for he expressly says, that he appeared unto him, and he calls it the heavenly vision, <a href="/acts/26-16.htm">Acts 26:16</a>. This was a sight of Christ in heaven, not on earth, such an one as Stephen had, and was a corporeal one; otherwise it would have been impertinent to have mentioned it, with the rest of the ocular testimonies of Christ's resurrection. Not that this was the last time that Christ was seen, or to be seen, for he was seen after this by the Apostle John in a visionary way, and will be corporeally seen by all the saints at the last day; but Paul was the last of the apostles and brethren before named, and he had his vision of Christ after them all; and perhaps it might be a more clear, full, and distinct one than any of the rest, as the last things are sometimes the most excellent. The apostle adds, as of <p>one born out of due time: or "as an abortive"; not that he was really one, but like one: several learned interpreters think the apostle refers to a proverbial way of speaking among the common people at Rome, who used to call such supernumerary senators in the times of Augustus Caesar, who got into the senate house by favour or bribery, "abortives" (i), they being generally very unworthy persons; and therefore calls himself by this name, as being in his own opinion a supernumerary apostle, and very unworthy of that office: though others rather think that he refers to a "posthumous" birth, to one that is born after the death of his father; because that the rest of the apostles were all chosen, and called, and sent forth, whilst Christ, their everlasting Father, was living on earth, but he not till after his death, resurrection from the dead, and ascension to heaven: but it seems best to understand him of an abortion, a miscarriage, or birth before its time; and may respect either the manner of his conversion, which was done both suddenly, immediately, and at once, by a sudden light from heaven, when he little thought of it, and had no expectation of it, which is commonly the case of abortions; and also powerfully and irresistibly, being effected by mighty and efficacious grace, as births before the full time are often occasioned by blows or outward force, and are violent extrusions of the foetus; or else the state and condition in which he was when Christ was first seen by him: as to his bodily state, as soon as ever he saw the light about him, and the object by it, he was struck blind, and continued so some days, like an hidden untimely birth, and like an infant that never saw light, <a href="/job/3-16.htm">Job 3:16</a>. And as to his spiritual estate, his soul was like an unshapen foetus, Christ being not yet formed in him, his image stamped on him, and his grace implanted in him; yea, it may be applied to the present apprehensions he had of himself, and which he expresses without a figure in the next verse, though in a beautiful manner, with a view to what he here says, when he observes that he was "the least of the apostles, and not meet to be called" one; as an abortive, or one born before its time, is imperfect in one respect or another, is not come to its proper size and shape, and scarcely is to be reckoned in the class and number of men. <p>(i) Vid.

The distinct explanation which he gives himself in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-9.htm" title="For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.">1 Corinthians 15:9</a> excludes all the other—some of them very odd—interpretations which have been given,[33] along with that of Hofmann: Paul designates himself so in contrast to <span class="ital">those</span> who, when Jesus appeared to them, were brethren (James too?) or apostles, and consequently had been “<span class="ital">born as children of God into the life of the faith of Christ</span>;” whereas with him the matter had not yet come to a <span class="ital">full formation of Christ</span> (<a href="/galatians/4-19.htm" title="My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you,">Galatians 4:19</a>), as was the case with the rest. This artificial interpretation is all the more erroneous, seeing that Paul, when Christ appeared to him, had not yet made even the first approach to being a Christian embryo, but was the most determined opponent of the Lord, and was closely engaged in persecuting Him (<a href="/acts/9-4.htm" title="And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying to him, Saul, Saul, why persecute you me?">Acts 9:4</a>); <span class="greekheb">ὡσπ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐκτρ</span>. does not describe what Paul <span class="ital">was then</span>, when Christ appeared to him, but what he is since that tim.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">κἀμοί</span>] at the end, with the unaffected stamp of humility after the expressions of self-abasement put before.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Observe, further, that Paul places the appearance of the Risen One made to himself in the same series with the others, without mentioning the ascension which lay between. Certainly, therefore, he did not regard the latter as the striking, epoch-making event, which it first appears in the narrative of the Book of Acts, forty days after the resurrection. See generally on <a href="/luke/24-51.htm" title="And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven.">Luke 24:51</a>, Remark.

Hofmann is wrong in making <span class="greekheb">πάντων</span> extend to the whole of the cases previously adduced. That would surely be a thing quite self-evident, namely, that in a series of cases following after each other, the last mentioned is just the <span class="ital">last</span> of all. No, <span class="greekheb">πάντων</span> is correlative to the preceding <span class="greekheb">πᾶσιν</span>, and the progress of thought is: “to the apostles <span class="ital">all, last of all</span>, however, to me also.” Thereby Paul gives adequate expression to the deep humility with which he sees himself added to the circle of the apostles.

However, Cv[2284], Gr[2285], Bt[2286], Gd[2287], and many find in the phrase an indication of <span class="ital">the suddenness and violence</span> of Paul’s birth into Christ; Hn[2288] and El[2289] see pictured in it, more appropriately, <span class="ital">the unripe birth</span> of one who was changed at a stroke from the persecutor into the Apostle, instead of maturing normally for his work,—“P. describes himself thus in contrast with those who, when Jesus appeared to them, were already brothers or apostles, already born as God’s children into the life of faith in Christ” (Hf[2290]).

The word here (after Tyndale) translated <span class="ital">born out of due time</span> refers to a birth out of the usual course of nature (cf. <a href="/psalms/58-8.htm" title="As a snail which melts, let every one of them pass away: like the untimely birth of a woman, that they may not see the sun.">Psalm 58:8</a>), about which there is therefore, (1) something violent and strange. Such was the nature of St Paul’s conversion, an event unparalleled in Scripture. Moreover, (2) such children are usually small and weakly, an idea which the next verse shews St Paul also had in mind. St Paul saw the Lord on more than one occasion. See note on ch. <a href="/1_corinthians/9-1.htm" title="Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are not you my work in the Lord?">1 Corinthians 9:1</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/1_corinthians/15.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/1_corinthians/15-8.htm" title="And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time.">1 Corinthians 15:8</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἒσχατον δὲ πάντων</span>) <span class="ital">and last of all</span>, or rather, <span class="ital">after them all</span>, in order to exclude himself.

The article is emphatic. Paul applies to himself alone this denomination in reference to the circumstances of the appearance, and in reference to the present time of writing. What <span class="greekheb">ἐκτρώμα</span>, <span class="ital">an abortion</span>, is among children, he says, I am among the apostles; and by this one word he sinks himself lower than in any other way. As an abortion is not worthy of the name of man, so the apostle declares that he is not worthy of the name of apostle. The metaphor, is drawn from the same idea from which the term <span class="ital">regeneration</span> is used, <a href="/1_peter/1-3.htm" title="Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy has begotten us again to a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,">1 Peter 1:3</a> [<span class="ital">Begotten again</span>—by the <span class="ital">resurrection</span> of Jesus, etc.]; <span class="greekheb">εἰ</span> in <span class="greekheb">ὡσπερεὶ</span> somewhat softens the phrase: <span class="ital">as if;</span> he shows that this ought not to be pressed too far.—<span class="greekheb">κᾀμόι</span>, <span class="ital">by me also</span>) This word is elegantly placed at the end of the period.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He was seen of me also.</span> The reference undoubtedly is to the vision on the road to Damascus (<a href="/acts/9-5.htm">Acts 9:5</a>; <a href="/acts/22-14.htm">Acts 22:14</a>; <a href="/acts/26-16.htm">Acts 26:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">As of one born out of due time;</span> literally, <span class="accented">as to the abortive born.</span> The word means "the untimely fruit of a woman," a child born out of the due time or natural course; and hence "diminutive" and "weakly."

The Hebrew nephel, which it is used to translate, occurs in the same sense in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/58-8.htm">Psalm 58:8</a>, where the Septuagint follows another reading of the Hebrew text. In every case the word means an abortion, a still-born embryo. In the same sense it is found frequently in Greek medical writers, as Galen and Hippocrates, and in the writings of Aristotle on physical science. This is the rendering of the Rheims Version: an abortive. Wyc., a dead-born child. The rendering of the A.V. and Rev. is unsatisfactory, since it introduces the notion of time which is not in the original word, and fails to express the abortive character of the product; leaving it to be inferred that it is merely premature, but living and not dead. The word does not mean an untimely living birth, but a dead abortion, and suggests no notion of lateness of birth, but rather of being born before the time. The words as unto the abortion are not to be connected with last of all - last of all as to the abortion - because there is no congruity nor analogy between the figure of an abortion and the fact that Christ appeared to him last. Connect rather with He appeared: last of all He appeared unto me as unto the abortion. Paul means that when Christ appeared to him and called him, he was - as compared with the disciples who had known and followed Him from the first, and whom he had been persecuting - no better than an unperfected foetus among living men. The comparison emphasizes his condition at the time of his call. The attempt to explain by a reference to Paul's insignificant appearance, from which he was nicknamed "The Abortion" by his enemies, requires no refutation. </body></html>
