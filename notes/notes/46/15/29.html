Then there will not appear such a startling or inexplicable abruptness in the words with which this new argument is commenced. “Else”—<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> if there be no resurrection—<span class= "ital">what shall they who are baptised for the dead do? If the dead be not raised at all, why are they then baptised for the dead?</span> Such is the proper punctuation, and not as in the English version, which joins the clause, “if the dead rise not,” with the preceding instead of with the following portion of the verse. Also the word translated “rise,” is “are raised.” This is an <span class= "ital">argumentum ad hominem.</span> The practice known as baptism for the dead was absurd if there be no resurrection. To practise it and to deny the doctrine of the resurrection was illogical. What shall they do?<span class= "ital"> i.e.,</span> What explanation shall they give of their conduct? asks the Apostle. There have been numerous and ingenious conjectures as to the meaning of this passage. The only tenable interpretation is that there existed amongst some of the Christians at Corinth a practice of baptising a living person in the stead of some convert who had died before that sacrament had been administered to him. Such a practice existed amongst the Marcionites in the second century, and still earlier amongst a sect called the Corinthians. The idea evidently was that whatever benefit flowed from baptism might be thus vicariously secured for the deceased Christian. St. Chrysostom gives the following description of it:—“After a catechumen (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> one prepared for baptism, but not actually baptised) was dead, they hid a living man under the bed of the deceased; then coming to the bed of the dead man they spake to him, and asked whether he would receive baptism, and he making no answer, the other replied in his stead, and so they baptised the ‘living for the dead.’” Does St. Paul then, by what he here says, sanction the superstitious practice? Certainly not. He carefully separates himself and the Corinthians, to whom he immediately addresses himself, from those who adopted this custom. He no longer uses the first or second person; it is “they” throughout this passage. It is no proof to others; it is simply the <span class= "ital">argumentum ad hominem.</span> Those who do that, and disbelieve a resurrection, refute themselves. This custom possibly sprang up amongst the Jewish converts, who had been accustomed to something similar in their own faith. If a Jew died without having been purified from some ceremonial uncleanness, some living person had the necessary ablution performed on them, and the dead were so accounted clean.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_corinthians/15.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/1_corinthians/15-29.htm" title="Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?...">1 Corinthians 15:29-30</a></span>. <span class="ital">Else, </span>or <span class="ital">otherwise, what shall they do </span>— What will become of them? what shall they do to repair their loss, who are exposed to great sufferings in consequence of being <span class="ital">baptized for the dead </span>— That is, say some, “In token of their embracing the Christian faith <span class="ital">in the room of the dead, </span>who are just fallen in the cause of Christ, but are yet supported by a succession of new converts, who immediately offer themselves to fill up their places, as ranks of soldiers that advance to combat in the room of their companions, who have just been slain in their sight.” Others say, “In hope of blessings to be received after they are numbered with the dead.” Many other interpretations are given of this obscure and ambiguous phrase, <span class="greekheb">υπερ των νεκρων</span>, <span class="ital">for the dead. </span>But perhaps that of Dr. Macknight is the most probable, who supplies the words <span class="greekheb">της αναστασεως</span>, and reads the clause, <span class="ital">who are baptized for the resurrection of the dead, </span>or are immersed in sufferings, because of their believing in, and testifying the doctrine of the resurrection of the dead: for which interpretation he adduces solid reasons. <span class="ital">If the dead rise not </span>— If the doctrine I oppose be true, and the dead are not raised at all; <span class="ital">why are they then baptized for the </span>resurrection of the <span class="ital">dead?

As through the sin of the first Adam, all men became mortal, because all had from him the same sinful nature, so, through the resurrection of Christ, shall all who are made to partake of the Spirit, and the spiritual nature, revive, and live for ever. There will be an order in the resurrection. Christ himself has been the first-fruits; at his coming, his redeemed people will be raised before others; at the last the wicked will rise also. Then will be the end of this present state of things. Would we triumph in that solemn and important season, we must now submit to his rule, accept his salvation, and live to his glory. Then shall we rejoice in the completion of his undertaking, that God may receive the whole glory of our salvation, that we may for ever serve him, and enjoy his favour. What shall those do, who are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? Perhaps baptism is used here in a figure, for afflictions, sufferings, and martyrdom, as Mt 20:22,23. What is, or will become of those who have suffered many and great injuries, and have even lost their lives, for this doctrine of the resurrection, if the dead rise not at all? Whatever the meaning may be, doubtless the apostle's argument was understood by the Corinthians. And it is as plain to us that Christianity would be a foolish profession, if it proposed advantage to themselves by their faithfulness to God; and to have our fruit to holiness, that our end may be everlasting life. But we must not live like beasts, as we do not die like them. It must be ignorance of God that leads any to disbelieve the resurrection and future life. Those who own a God and a providence, and observe how unequal things are in the present life, how frequently the best men fare worst, cannot doubt as to an after-state, where every thing will be set to rights. Let us not be joined with ungodly men; but warn all around us, especially children and young persons, to shun them as a pestilence. Let us awake to righteousness, and not sin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Else what shall they do ... - The apostle here resumes the argument for the resurrection which was interrupted at <a href="/1_corinthians/15-19.htm">1 Corinthians 15:19</a>. He goes on to state further consequences which must follow from the denial of this doctrine, and thence infers that the doctrine must be true. There is, perhaps, no passage of the New Testament in respect to which there has been a greater variety of interpretation than this; and the views of expositors now by no means harmonize in regard to its meaning. It is possible that Paul may here refer to some practice or custom which existed in his time respecting baptism, the knowledge of which is now lost. The various opinions which have been entertained in regard to this passage, together with an examination of them, may be seen in Pool's Synopsis, Rosenmuller, and Bloomfield. It may be not useless just to refer to some of them, that the perplexity of commentators may be seen:<p>(1) It has been held by some that by "the dead" here is meant the Messiah who was put to death, the plural being used for the singular, meaning "the dead one."<p>(2) by others, that the word "baptized" here is taken in the sense of washing, cleansing, purifying, as in <a href="/matthew/8-4.htm">Matthew 8:4</a>; <a href="/hebrews/9-10.htm">Hebrews 9:10</a>; and that the sense is, that the dead were carefully washed and purified when buried, with the hope of the resurrection, and, as it were, preparatory to that.<p>(3) by others, that to be "baptized for the dead" means to be baptized as dead, being baptized into Christ, and buried with him in baptism, and that by their immersion they were regarded as dead.<p>(4) by others, that the apostle refers to a custom of vicarious baptism, or being baptized for those who were dead, referring to the practice of having some person baptized in the place of one who had died without baptism. This was the opinion of Grotius, Michaelis, Tertullian, and Ambrose. Such was the estimate which was formed, it is supposed, of the importance of baptism, that when one had died without being baptized, some other person was baptized over his dead body in his place. That this custom prevailed in the church after the time of Paul, has been abundantly proved by Grotius, and is generally admitted. But the objections to this interpretation are obvious:<p>(a) There is no evidence that such a custom prevailed in the time of Paul.<p>(b) It cannot be believed that Paul would give countenance to a custom so senseless and so contrary to the Scripture, or that he would make it the foundation of a solemn argument.<p>(c) It does not accord with the strain and purpose of his argument. If this custom had been referred to, his design would have led him to say, "What will become of them for whom others have been baptized? Are we to believe that they have perished?"<p>(d) It is far more probable that the custom referred to in this opinion arose from an erroneous interpretation of this passage of Scripture, than that it existed in the time of Paul.<p>(5) there remain two other opinions, both of which are plausible, and one of which is probably the true one. One is, that the word baptized is used here as it is in <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/20-22.htm">Matthew 20:22-23</a>; <a href="/mark/10-39.htm">Mark 10:39</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/12-50.htm">Luke 12:50</a>, in the sense of being overwhelmed with calamities, trials, and sufferings; and as meaning that the apostles and others were subjected to great trials on account of the dead, that is, in the hope of the resurrection; or with the expectation that the dead would rise. This is the opinion of Lightfoot, Rosenmuller, Pearce, Homberg, Krause, and of Prof. Robinson (see the Lexicon article &#x392;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;  Baptizo&#772;), and has much that is plausible. That the word is thus used to denote a deep sinking into calamities, there can be no doubt. And that the apostles and early Christians subjected themselves, or were subjected to great and overwhelming calamities on account of the hope of the resurrection, is equally clear. This interpretation, also, agrees with the general tenor of the argument; and is an argument for the resurrection. And it implies that this was the full and constant belief of all who endured these trials, that there would be a resurrection of the dead. The argument would be, that they should be slow to adopt an opinion which would imply that all their sufferings were endured for nothing, and that God had supported them in this in vain; that God had plunged them into all these sorrows, and had sustained them in them only to disappoint them. That this view is plausible, and that it suits the strain of remark in the following verses, is evident. But there are objections to it:<p>(a) It is not the usual and natural meaning of the word "baptize."<p>(b) A metaphorical use of a word should not be resorted to unless necessary.<p>(c) The literal meaning of the word here will as well meet the design of the apostle as the metaphorical.<p>(d) This interpretation does not relieve us from any of the difficulties in regard to the phrase "for the dead;" and,<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>29. Else&#8212;if there be no resurrection.<p>what shall they do?&#8212;How wretched is their lot!<p>they &#8230; which are baptized for the dead&#8212;third person; a class distinct from that in which the apostle places himself, "we" (1Co 15:30); first person. Alford thinks there is an allusion to a practice at Corinth of baptizing a living person in behalf of a friend who died unbaptized; thus Paul, without giving the least sanction to the practice, uses an ad hominem argument from it against its practicers, some of whom, though using it, denied the resurrection: "What account can they give of their practice; why are they at the trouble of it, if the dead rise not?" [So Jesus used an ad hominem argument, Mt 12:27]. But if so, it is strange there is no direct censure of it. Some Marcionites adopted the practice at a later period, probably from taking this passage, as Alford does; but, generally, it was unknown in the Church. Bengel translates, "over (immediately upon) the dead," that is, who will be gathered to the dead immediately after baptism. Compare Job 17:1, "the graves are ready for me." The price they get for their trouble is, that they should be gathered to the dead for ever (1Co 15:13, 16). Many in the ancient Church put off baptism till near death. This seems the better view; though there may have been some rites of symbolical baptism at Corinth, now unknown, perhaps grounded on Jesus' words (Mt 20:22, 23), which Paul here alludes to. The best punctuation is, "If the dead rise not at all, why are they then baptized for them" (so the oldest manuscripts read the last words, instead of "for the dead")?<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_corinthians/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> A very difficult text, and variously expounded. The terms baptize, and baptism, signify no more in their original and native signification, than to wash, and a washing: the <span class="ital">washing of pots and cups, </span> in use amongst the Jews, is, in the Greek, the baptisms of pots and cups. But the most usual acceptation of baptism in Scripture, is to signify one of the sacraments of the New Testament; that sacred action, by which one is washed according to the institution of Christ, <span class="ital">in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.</span> It is also metaphorically used by our Saviour in the Gospels, <span class="bld"><a href="/matthew/20-22.htm" title="But Jesus answered and said, You know not what you ask. Are you able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? They say to him, We are able.">Matthew 20:22</a>,23 Mr 10:38,39 Lu 12:50</span>, to signify a suffering for the name of Christ. And it is also used thus metaphorically, to signify the action of the Holy Ghost in cleansing and renewing our hearts, <span class="bld"><a href="/matthew/3-11.htm" title="I indeed baptize you with water to repentance. but he that comes after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear. he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire.">Matthew 3:11</a>,12Jo 3:5</span>. The last usage of the term is by no means applicable here. The question is: Whether the apostle meaneth here only: Why are men washed for the dead? Or why are men baptized religiously for the dead? Or why are men baptized with blood for the dead? For the popish notion, that baptism here signifies any religious actions, as fastings, and prayers, and penances for those that are in purgatory, there is no such usage of the term in Scripture; for though in Scripture it signifies sometimes sufferings from the hands of others, as in <span class="bld"><a href="/matthew/20-22.htm" title="But Jesus answered and said, You know not what you ask. Are you able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? They say to him, We are able.">Matthew 20:22</a>,23 Mr 10:38,39</span>, yet it no where signifies penances, or such sufferings as men impose upon themselves for the dead. Nor doth Paul here say: To what purpose do men baptize themselves? But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">why are they baptized for the dead?</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. Those that think the term here signifies washing, <span class="bld">what shall they do who are</span> washed <span class="bld">for the dead?</span> Tell us, that it being a custom in many countries, for neatness and cleanliness, to wash dead bodies, the primitive Christians used that ceremony as a religious rite, and a testification of their belief of the resurrection. That such a custom was in use amongst Christians, is plain from <span class="bld"><a href="/acts/9-37.htm" title="And it came to pass in those days, that she was sick, and died: whom when they had washed, they laid her in an upper chamber.">Acts 9:37</a></span>: but that they used it as religious rite, or a testimony of their taith in the resurrection, appeareth not. And though it be uper twn nekrwn, yet they say uper is so used, <span class="bld"><a href="/romans/15-8.htm" title="Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made to the fathers:">Romans 15:8</a></span>, <span class="ital">for the truth of God, </span> expounded by the next word, <span class="ital">to confirm the promises.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. Those that think, that by baptizing, in this text, the sacrament of baptism is to be understood, give us more than one account. Some say, that whereas they were wont in the primitive church, before they admitted persons into a full communion with the church, to keep them for some time under catechism, in which time they were called <span class="ital">catechumeni; </span> if such fell sick, and in danger of death, they baptized them; or if they died suddenly, they baptized some other for them, in testimony of their hope of the joyful resurrection of such a person to eternal life. Now admit this were an error of practice in them, as to this ordinance; yet if any such thing were in practice in this church, the argument of the apostle was good against them. But how shall any such thing be made appear to us, that there was such an early corruption in this church? Others say, that some, believing the resurrection, would upon their death beds be baptized, in testimony of it, from whence they had the name of <span class="ital">clinici.</span> Others say: To be <span class="ital">baptized for the dead, </span> signifieth to be baptized when they were dying, and so as good as dead. Mr. Calvin chooseth this sense: but the question is: Whether the Greek phrase uper twn nekrwn will bear it? Others tell us of a custom in use in the primitive church, to baptize persons over the graves of the martyrs, as a testimony of their belief of the resurrection. That there was anciently such a custom, I doubt not; and I believe that the custom with us in reading of prayers over dead bodies at the grave, doth much more probably derive from this ancient usage, than the papists’ praying for the dead; but that there was any such custom so ancient as the apostles’ times, I very much doubt. There are yet two other senses given of this difficult phrase, either of which seemeth to me much more probable than any of these. To the first we are led by the next verse: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And why stand we in jeopardy every hour?</span> Which inclineth many good interpreters to think, that the baptism here mentioned, is that baptism with blood mentioned by our Saviour, <span class="bld"><a href="/matthew/20-22.htm" title="But Jesus answered and said, You know not what you ask. Are you able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? They say to him, We are able.">Matthew 20:22</a>,23</span>; and so the sense is no more than, if there be no resurrection of the dead, why do we die daily? Why are we killed all the day long? For we do that in hope of a blessed resurrection. The only objections against this are: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. That none but Christ himself useth the word in this sense (which seemeth a light exception). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. That uper twn nekrwn is hardly capable of that sense; but yet our learned Dr. Lightfoot brings parallels of such a usage of the preposition out of the LXX. Others observe, that the apostle, in this whole chapter, is discoursing of the resurrection of believers unto life, and they are such dead alone, that he here speaketh of, for whom he saith any were baptized. Now, it is plain from Scripture, that baptism is a seal of the resurrection, signifying to believers, that they shall be made partakers of the death and resurrection of Christ (the resurrection being strongly proved from God’s covenant, of which baptism is a seal, <span class="bld"><a href="/luke/20-37.htm" title="Now that the dead are raised, even Moses showed at the bush, when he calls the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.">Luke 20:37</a>,38</span>); and being so, it confirmed the covenant, not only to the persons baptized, but to the whole church, as well the triumphant as the militant part of it; as well with reference to those of it that were dead, as those that were living. So that so often as baptism was administered in the church, so often God repeated the covenant made to his whole church, that he was the God of believers and of their seed: so that all who to this day are baptized, are baptized for the dead, that is, for the confirmation of God’s covenant to his whole church, as well that part of it which is dead, as that part which is yet alive; and it testifieth, that those that sleep in Christ (although dead) yet live in the promise of the resurrection, because God is their God, and he is not the <span class="ital">God of the dead, but of the living, </span> as our Saviour speaketh in <span class="bld"><a href="/luke/20-38.htm" title="For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all live to him.">Luke 20:38</a></span>. In this variety amongst learned men about the true sense of this place, I shall leave the reader to his own judgment, although to me the two last seem to be most probable. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_corinthians/15.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead,.... The apostle here returns to his subject, and makes use of new arguments to prove the doctrine of the resurrection of the dead, and reasons for it from the baptism of some persons; but what is his sense, is not easy to be understood, or what rite and custom, or thing, or action he refers to; which must, be either Jewish baptism, or Christian baptism literally taken, or baptism in a figurative and metaphorical sense. Some think that he refers to some one or other of the divers baptisms of the Jews; see <a href="/hebrews/9-10.htm">Hebrews 9:10</a> and particularly to the purification of such who had touched a dead body, which was done both by the ashes of the red heifer burnt, and by bathing himself in water; and which, the Jews say (l), intimated , "the resurrection of the dead": wherefore such a right was needless, if there is no resurrection; to strengthen this sense, a passage in Ecclesiasticus 34:25 is produced,  , "he that washeth himself after the touching of a dead body, if he touch it again, what availeth his washing?" but the phrase there used is different; it is not said, he that baptizeth or washeth himself for the dead, but from the dead, to cleanse himself from pollution received by the touch of a dead body: it is also observed, that the Jews, as well as other nations, have used various rites and ceremonies about their dead, and among the rest, the washing of dead bodies before interment; see <a href="/acts/9-37.htm">Acts 9:37</a> and this by some is thought to be what is here referred to; and the reasoning is, if there is no resurrection of the dead, why all this care of a dead body? why this washing of it? it may as well be put into the earth as it is, since it will rise no more; but how this can be called a baptism for the dead, I see not: rather therefore Christian baptism, or the ordinance of water baptism is here respected; and with regard to this, interpreters go different ways: some think the apostle has in view a custom of some, who when their friends died without baptism, used to be baptized in their room; this is said to be practised by the Marcionites in Tertullian's time, and by the Corinthians in the times of the Apostle John; but it does not appear to have been in use in the times of the Apostle Paul; and besides, if it had been, as it was a vain and superstitious one, he would never have mentioned it without a censure, and much less have argued from it; nor would his argument be of any weight, since it might be retorted, that whereas such persons were mistaken in using such a practice, they might be also in the doctrine of the resurrection of the dead: others are of opinion that such persons are intended, called Clinics, who deferred their baptism till they came upon their death beds, and then had it administered to them; but as this practice was not in being in the apostle's time, and was far from being a laudable one; and though the persons to whom it was administered were upon the point of death, and nearer the dead than the living, and were as good as dead, and might be intended by them, for their advantage, when dead and not living; yet it must be a great force and strain on words and things, to reckon this a being baptized for the dead: others would have the words rendered, "over the dead"; and suppose that reference is had to the Christians that had their "baptisteries" in their places of burial, and by being baptized here, testified their faith and hope of the resurrection of the dead; but this was rather a being baptized among the dead, than over them, or for them; and moreover it is not certain, that they did make use of such places to baptize in; to which may be added, that the primitive Christians had not so early burying grounds of their own: others would have the meaning to be, that they were baptized for their dead works, their sins, to wash them away; but this baptism does not of itself, and no otherwise than by leading the faith of persons to the blood of Christ, which alone cleanses from sin, original and actual; nor is this appropriate to the apostle's argument. Others imagine, that he intends such as were baptized, and added to the church, and so filled up the places of them that were dead; but the reason from hence proving the resurrection of the dead is not very obvious: those seem to be nearer the truth of the matter, who suppose that the apostle has respect to the original practice of making a confession of faith before baptism, and among the rest of the articles of it, the doctrine of the resurrection of the dead, upon the belief of which being baptized, they might be said to be baptized for the dead; that is, for, or upon, or in the faith and profession of the resurrection of the dead, and therefore must either hold this doctrine, or renounce their baptism administered upon it; to which may be added another sense of the words, which is, that baptism performed by immersion, as it was universally in those early times, was a lively emblem and representation of the resurrection of Christ from the dead, and also both of the spiritual and corporeal resurrection of the saints. Now if there is no resurrection, why is such a symbol used? it is useless and insignificant; I see nothing of moment to be objected to these two last senses, which may be easily put together, but this; that the apostle seems to point out something that was done or endured by some Christians only; whereas baptism, upon a profession of faith in Christ, and the resurrection from the dead, and performed by immersion, as an emblem of it, was common to all; and therefore he would rather have said, what shall we do, or we all do, who are baptized for the dead? I am therefore rather inclined to think that baptism is used here in a figurative and metaphorical sense, for afflictions, sufferings, and martyrdom, as in <a href="/matthew/20-22.htm">Matthew 20:22</a> and it was for the belief, profession, and preaching of the doctrine of the resurrection of the dead, both of Christ and of the saints, that the apostles and followers of Christ endured so much as they did; the first instance of persecution after our Lord's ascension was on this account. The Apostles Peter and John, were laid hold on and put in prison for preaching this doctrine; the reproach and insult the Apostle Paul met with at Athens were by reason of it; and it was for this that he was called in question and accused of the Jews; nor was there anyone doctrine of Christianity more hateful and contemptible among the Heathens than this was. Now the apostle's argument stands thus, what is, or will become of those persons who have been as it were baptized or overwhelmed in afflictions and sufferings, who have endured so many and such great injuries and indignities, and have even lost their lives for asserting this doctrine, <p>if the dead rise not at all? how sadly mistaken must such have been! <p>why are they then baptized for the dead? how imprudently have they acted! and what a weak and foolish part do they also act, who continue to follow them! in what a silly manner do they expose themselves to danger, and throw away their lives, if this doctrine is not true! which sense is confirmed by what follows: the Alexandrian copy, and some others, read, "for them", and so the Vulgate Latin version; and the Ethiopic in both clauses reads, "why do they baptize?" <p>(l) R.

Pure and superfluous arbitrariness; as always, so here too, <span class="greekheb">ἐπεί</span> points to what has immediately preceded. But, of course, in this connection the final absolute sovereignty of God is conceived as <span class="ital">conditioned by the resurrection of the dead</span>, which, after all that had been previously said from <a href="/1_corinthians/15-20.htm" title="But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the first fruits of them that slept.">1 Corinthians 15:20</a> onwards, presented itself to every reader as a thing self-evident. Hofmann makes <span class="greekheb">ἐπεί</span> refer to the whole paragraph beginning with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΠΑΡΧῊ ΧΡΙΣΤΌς</span></span></span>, as that is construed by him, down to <a href="/1_corinthians/15-26.htm" title="The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.">1 Corinthians 15:26</a>, to which <a href="/context/1_corinthians/15-27.htm" title="For he has put all things under his feet.

But see on <a href="/1_corinthians/15-24.htm" title="Then comes the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power.">1 Corinthians 15:24</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-27.htm" title="For he has put all things under his feet.

The <span class="ital">future</span> is that of the general proposition,[60] and applies to every baptism of this kind which should occur. Every such baptism will be without all meaning, if the deniers of the resurrection are in the right. Grotius: “quid <span class="ital">efficient</span>” (comp. Flatt). But that a baptism of such a kind <span class="ital">effected</span> anything, was assuredly a thought foreign to the apostle. He wished to point out the <span class="ital">subjective</span> absurdity of the procedure in the case assumed. The interpretation: “<span class="ital">nescient quid agendum sit</span>” (van Hengel) does not suit the connection, into which Ewald also imports too much: “are they to think, that they have cherished faith and hope in vain?”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὑπὲρ τῶν νεκρῶν</span>] The article is <span class="ital">generic</span>. Every baptism which, as the case occurs, is undertaken for a dead person, is a baptism <span class="ital">for the dead</span>, namely, as regards the <span class="ital">category</span>. It must have been something not wholly unusual in the apostolic church, familiarity with which on the part of the readers is here taken for granted, that persons had themselves baptized once more for the benefit of (<span class="greekheb">ὑπέρ</span>) people who had died <span class="ital">unbaptized</span> but <span class="ital">already believing</span>, in the persuasion that this would be counted to them as their own baptism, and thus as the supplement of their conversion to Christ which had already taken place inwardly, and that they would on this account all the more certainly be raised up with the Christians at the Parousia, and made partakers of the eternal Messianic salvation.[61] This custom propagated and maintained itself afterwards only among heretical sects, in particular among the Cerinthians (Epiphanius, <span class="ital">Haer</span>. xxviii. 7) and among the Marcionites (Chrysostom; comp., moreover, generally Tertullian, <span class="ital">de resurr.</span> 48, <span class="ital">adv. Marc.</span> v. 10).[62] Among the great multitude of interpretations (Calovius, even in his time, counts up twenty-three), this is the only one which is presented to us by the words. Ambrosiaster first took them so;[63] among the later interpreters, Anselm, Erasmus, Zeger, Cameron, Calixtus, Grotius, <span class="ital">al.</span>; and recently, Augusti, <span class="ital">Denkwürdigk</span>. IV. p. 119; Winer, p. 165 [E. T. 219]; Billroth, Rückert, de Wette, Maier, Neander, Grimm, Holtzmann (<span class="ital">Judenth. u. Christenth</span>. p. 741), also Kling and Paret (in Ewald’s <span class="ital">Jahrb.</span> IX. p. 247 f.), both of which latter writers call to their aid, on the ground, it is true, of <a href="/1_corinthians/11-30.htm" title="For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.">1 Corinthians 11:30</a>, the assumption of a pestilence having then prevailed in Corinth. The usual objection, that Paul would not have employed for his purpose at all, or at least not without adding some censure, such an abuse founded on the belief in a magical power of baptism (see especially, Calvin <span class="ital">in loc.</span>), is not conclusive, for Paul may be arguing <span class="ital">ex concesso</span>, and hence may allow the relation of the matter to evangelical truth to remain undetermined in the meantime, seeing that it does not belong to the proper subject of his present discourse. The abuse in question must afterwards have been condemned by apostolic teachers (hence it maintained itself only among heretics), and no doubt Paul too aided in the work of its removal. For to assume, with Baumgarten-Crusius (<span class="ital">Dogmengesch</span>. II. p. 313), that he himself had never at all disapproved of the <span class="greekheb">βαπτίζεσθαι ὑπὲρ τῶν νεκρῶν</span>, or to place, with Rückert, the vicarious baptism in the same line with the vicarious death of Christ, is to stand in the very teeth of the fundamental doctrine of the Pauline gospel—that of faith as the subjective ethical “causa medians” of salvation. For the rest, Rückert says well: “Usurpari ab eo morem, qui ceteroqui displiceret, ad errorem, in quo impugnando versabatur, radicitus evellendum, ipsius autem reprehendendi aliud tempus expectari.” The silent disapproval of the apostle is brought in by Erasmus in his Paraphrase: “Fidem probo, factum non probo; nam ut ridiculum est, existimare mortuo succurri baptismo alieno, ita recte credunt resurrectionem futuram.” Epiphanius, <span class="ital">Haer</span>. 28, explains it of the baptism of the <span class="ital">clinici</span>, of the catechumens on their deathbed, who <span class="greekheb">πρὸ τῆς τελευτῆς λουτροῦ καταξιοῦνται</span>. So Calvin, although giving it along with another interpretation equally opposed to the meaning of the words; also Flacius, Estius, <span class="ital">al.</span> But how can <span class="greekheb">ὑπὲρ τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">νεκρ</span>. mean <span class="ital">jamjam morituri</span> (Estius)! or how can the rendering “<span class="ital">ut mortuis, non vivis prosit</span>” (Calvin) lead any one to guess that the “baptismus clinicorum” was intended, even supposing that it had been already customary at that time![64] Chrysostom, too, runs counter to the words: <span class="greekheb">ὑπὲρ τῶν νεκρῶν</span>, <span class="greekheb">τουτέστι τῶν σωμάτων</span>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ γὰρ ἐπὶ τοῦτο βαπτίζῃ</span>, <span class="greekheb">τοῦ νεκροῦ σώματος ἀνάστασιν πιστεύων</span>. Paul, he holds, has in view the article in the baptismal creed (which, however, certainly belongs only to a later time): “I believe in a resurrection of the dead.” So, too, on the whole, Pelagius, Oecumenius, Photius, Theophylact, Melanchthon (“profitentes de mortuis”), Cornelius a Lapide, Er. Schmid, and others; and somewhat to the same effect also Wetstein. Comp. yet earlier, Tertullian: “pro <span class="ital">mortuis</span> tingi pro <span class="ital">corporibus</span> est tingi.” Theodoret gives it a different turn, but likewise imports a meaning, making the reference to be to the dead body: <span class="greekheb">ὁ βαπτιζόμενος</span>, <span class="greekheb">φησι</span>, <span class="greekheb">τῷ δεσπότῃ συνθάπτεται</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἵνα τοῦ θανάτου κοινωνήσας καὶ τῆς ἀναστάσεως γένηται κοινωνός</span>· <span class="greekheb">εἰ δὲ νεκρόν ἐστι τὸ σῶμα</span>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ οὐκ ἀνίσταται</span>, <span class="greekheb">τί δήποτε καὶ βαπτίζεται</span>. Luther’s explanation, adopted again recently by Ewald and others, that “to confirm the resurrection, the Christians had themselves baptized <span class="ital">over the graves of the dead</span>” (so Glass and many of the older Lutherans; Calovius leaves us to choose between this view and that of Ambrosiaster), has against it, apart even from the fact that <span class="greekheb">ὑπέρ</span> with the genitive in the local sense of <span class="ital">over</span> is foreign to the New Testament, the following considerations: (1) that there is a lack of any historical trace in the apostolic period of the custom of baptizing over graves, such as of martyrs (for Eusebius, <span class="ital">H. E.</span> iv. 15, is not speaking of baptism), often as churches were built, as is well known, in later times over the graves of saints; (2) that we can see no reason why just the <span class="ital">baptism</span> at such places should be brought forward, and not the <span class="ital">regarding</span> of these spots <span class="ital">as consecrated</span> generally; (3) that to mark out the burial-places of pious persons who had fallen asleep, would have been in no way anything absurd even without the belief in a resurrection. And lastly, baptism took place at that time not in fonts or vessels of that kind, which could be set over graves, but in rivers and other natural supplies of water. Other interpreters, following Pelagius, refer <span class="greekheb">ὑπὲρ τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">νεκρ</span>. to <span class="ital">Christ</span>, taking <span class="greekheb">βαπτ</span>. in some cases of the baptism with water (Olearius, Schrader, Lange, Elwert); in others, of the baptism with blood (Al. Morus, Lightfoot). <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤῶΝ ΝΕΚΡ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> would thus be the plural of the category (see on <a href="/matthew/2-20.htm" title="Saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are dead which sought the young child's life.">Matthew 2:20</a>). But, putting aside the consideration that Christ cannot be designated as <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΝΕΚΡΌς</span></span></span> (not even according to the view of the opponents), the baptism with water did not take place <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὙΠῈΡ ΧΡΙΣΤΟῦ</span></span></span>,[65] but <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕἸς ΧΡΙΣΤΌΝ</span></span></span>; and the baptism with blood would have required to be forcibly indicated by the preceding context, or by the addition of some defining clause. “<span class="ital">For the benefit of the dead</span>” remains the right interpretation. Olshausen holds this also, but expounds it to this effect, that the baptism took place for the good of the dead, inasmuch as a certain number, a <span class="greekheb">πλήρωμα</span> of believers, is requisite, which must first be fully made up before the Parousia and the resurrection can follow. But this idea must be implied in the connection; what reader could divine it? Olshausen himself feels this, and therefore proposes to render, “who have themselves baptized <span class="ital">instead</span> of the members removed from the church by death.” So, too, in substance Isenberg (whose idea, however, is that of a <span class="ital">militia Christi</span> which has to be recruited), and among the older interpreters Clericus on Hammond, Deyling, <span class="ital">Obss.</span> II. p. 519, ed. 3, and Döderlein, <span class="ital">Instit.</span> I. p. 409. But in that case <span class="greekheb">ὑπὲρ τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">νεκρ</span>. would be something not at all essential and probative for the connection, since it is plain that every entrance of new believers into the church makes up for the departure of Christians who have died, but in this relation has nothing to do with the resurrection of the latter. This at the same time in opposition to van Hengel’s interpretation, about which he himself, however, has doubts: <span class="ital">for the honour of deceased Christians</span>, “quos exteri vituperare vel despicere soleant.” According to Diestelmann, <span class="greekheb">ὑπὲρ τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ν</span>. is <span class="ital">for the sake of the dead</span>, and means: <span class="ital">in order</span> hereafter <span class="ital">united with them</span> in the resurrection <span class="ital">to enter into the kingdom of Christ</span>; while the <span class="greekheb">νεκροί</span> are <span class="ital">Christ and those fallen asleep in Him</span>.[66] But it is decisive against this view, first, that there is thus comprised in the simple preposition, an extent of meaning which the reader could not discover in it without more precise indication; secondly, that <span class="ital">every</span> baptism <span class="ital">whatsoever</span> would be also in this assumed sense a <span class="greekheb">βαπτίζεσθαι ὑπὲρ τῶν νεκρῶν</span>, whereby therefore nothing distinctive would be said here, such as one could not but expect after the quite singular expression; thirdly, that Christ cannot be taken as included among the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΝΕΚΡΟῖ</span></span></span>, seeing that the resurrection <span class="ital">of the Lord</span> which had taken place was not the subject of the denial of resurrection here combated, but its denial is attributed by Paul to his opponents only <span class="ital">per consequentiam</span>, <a href="/1_corinthians/15-13.htm" title="But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen:">1 Corinthians 15:13</a>. According to Köster, those are meant <span class="ital">who have themselves baptized for the sake of their Christian friends who have fallen asleep, i.e.</span> out of yearning after them, in order to remain in connection with them, and to become partakers with them of the resurrection and eternal life. But in this way also a significance is imported into the simple <span class="greekheb">ὑπὲρ τῶν νεκρῶν</span>, which there is nothing whatever to suggest, and which would have been easily conveyed, at least by some such addition as <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣΥΓΓΕΝῶΝ ΚΑῚ ΦΊΛΩΝ</span></span></span>. According to Linder, the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΒΑΠΤΙΖΌΜΕΝΟΙ</span></span></span> and the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΝΕΚΡΟΊ</span></span></span> are held to be even the same persons, so that the meaning would be: <span class="ital">if they do not rise</span> (<span class="ital">in gratiam cinerum</span>), which, however, the article of itself forbids; merely <span class="greekheb">ὑπὲρ νεκρῶν</span> (<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΝΕΚΡ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> would be in fact <span class="ital">qualitative</span>) must have been made use of, and even in that case it would be a poetical mode of expression, which no reader would have had any clue to help him to unriddle. Similarly, but with a still more arbitrary importing of meaning, Otto holds that <span class="greekheb">οἱ βαπτιζόμ</span>. are the deniers of the resurrection, who had themselves baptized in order (which is said, according to him, ironically) <span class="ital">to become dead instead of living men</span>. Most of all does Hofmann twist and misinterpret the whole passage (comp. also his <span class="ital">Schriftbew.</span> II. 2, p. 199 f.), punctuating it thus: <span class="greekheb">ἐπεὶ τί ποιήσ</span>. <span class="greekheb">οἱ βαπτ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὑπὲρ τῶν νεκρῶν</span>, <span class="greekheb">εἰ ὅλως νεκρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">οὐκ ἐγείρονται</span>; <span class="greekheb">τί καὶ βαπτίζονται</span>; <span class="greekheb">ὑπὲρ αὐτῶν τί καὶ ἡμεῖς κινδυνεύομεν</span>; the thought being: “<span class="ital">If those, who by means of sin lie in death, become subject in their sins to an utter death from which there is no rising, then will those, who have themselves baptized, find no reason in their Christian status to do anything for them, that may help them out of the death in which they lie;” nay, why do they then have themselves baptized? and why do we risk our lives for them?</span> <span class="greekheb">Ὑπὲρ τῶν νεκρ</span>. thus belongs to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΊ ΠΟΙΉΣ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>; the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὙΠῈΡ ΑὐΤῶΝ</span></span></span>, placed for emphasis at the head of the last question, applies to the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΒΑΠΤΙΖΌΜΕΝΟΙ</span></span></span>. Every point in this interpretation is incorrect; for (1) to do something for others, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> for their good, is an <span class="ital">absolute</span> duty, independent of the question whether there be a resurrection or not. (2) But to do something <span class="ital">which will help them out of death</span>, is not in the passage at all, but is imported into it. (3) Those who can and should do something for others are the <span class="ital">Christians</span>; these, however, cannot have been designated so strangely as by <span class="greekheb">οἱ βαπτιζόμενοι</span>, but must have been called in an intelligible way <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΟἹ ΠΙΣΤΕΎΣΑΝΤΕς</span></span></span> perhaps, or at least <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΟἹ ΒΑΠΤΙΣΘΈΝΤΕς</span></span></span>. (4) The <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΝΕΚΡΟΊ</span></span></span> can only, in accordance with the context, be simply the <span class="ital">dead, i.e.</span> those who have <span class="ital">died</span>, as through the whole chapter from <a href="/1_corinthians/15-12.htm" title="Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?">1 Corinthians 15:12</a> to <a href="/1_corinthians/15-52.htm" title="In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.">1 Corinthians 15:52</a>. (5) To give to <span class="greekheb">ὑπὲρ αὐτῶν</span> another reference than <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὙΠῈΡ ΤῶΝ ΝΕΚΡῶΝ</span></span></span>, is just as violent a shift as the severance of either of the two from <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΒΑΠΤΊΖΕΣΘΑΙ</span></span></span>, in connection with which they are symmetrically requisite for more precise definition, and are so placed. And when (6) <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὙΠῈΡ ΑὐΤῶΝ</span></span></span> is actually made to mean “<span class="ital">in order to induce them to receive baptism</span>,” this just crowns the arbitrariness of inserting between the lines what the apostle, according to the connection, could neither say nor think. Moreover, <span class="greekheb">ὑπὲρ αὐτῶν</span> could not have the emphasis, but only the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἩΜΕῖς</span></span></span> introduced with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΊ</span></span></span>, like the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΒΑΠΤΊΖ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> previously introduced with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΊ</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ΕἸ ὍΛΩς ΝΕΚΡΟῚ ΟὐΚ ἘΓΕΊΡ</span></span></span>.] Parallel to the conditional clause to be supplied in connection with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΠΕΊ</span></span></span>. For Paul conceives of the resurrection of the dead as being so necessarily connected with the completion of the Messianic kingdom that the denial of the one is also the denial of the other. <span class="ital">If universally</span> (as <a href="/1_corinthians/5-1.htm" title="It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife.">1 Corinthians 5:1</a>) <span class="ital">dead persons cannot be raised up, why do they have themselves baptized also for them?</span> since plainly, in that case, they would have <span class="ital">nothing at all</span> to do for the dead.

Equally little warrant is there for inserting what Krauss, p. 130, imports into it, taking it of baptism in the face of death: “Who caused themselves to receive a consecration to life, while, notwithstanding, they <span class="ital">were coming</span> not to the living, but <span class="ital">to the dead</span>.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[65] Elwert, p. 15, defines the conception of the <span class="greekheb">βαπτίζεσθαι ὑπὲρ Χριστοῦ</span>: “eo fine et consilio, ut per baptismum Christo addictus quaecunque suis promisit, tibi propria facias.” But that is plainly included in the contents of the <span class="greekheb">βαπτ</span>. <span class="greekheb">εἰς Χ</span>. or <span class="greekheb">ἐν ὀνόματι τοῦ κυρίου</span>, and one does not see from this why Paul should have chosen the peculiar expression with <span class="greekheb">ὑπέρ</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[66] Comp., too, Breitschwert in the <span class="ital">Würtemb.

THE EFFECT OF UNBELIEF IN THE RESURRECTION. To clinch the argument for the truth and the necessity of the Christian resurrection and to bring it home to the readers, the Ap. points out how futile Christian devotion must be, such as is witnessed in “those baptised for the dead” and in his own daily hazards, if death ends all (<a href="/context/1_corinthians/15-29.htm" title="Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?...">1 Corinthians 15:29-31</a>); present enjoyment would then appear the highest good (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-32.htm" title="If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantages it me, if the dead rise not? let us eat and drink; for to morrow we die.">1 Corinthians 15:32</a>). The effect of unbelief in the future life is already painfully apparent in the relaxed moral tone of a certain part of the Cor[2408] Church (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-33.htm" title="Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.">1 Corinthians 15:33</a> f.).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[2408] Corinth, Corinthian or Corinthians.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/1_corinthians/15.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">29</span>. <span class="ital">Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead</span>] St Paul now abruptly changes the subject, and appeals to the conduct of Christians as a witness to their belief. This is again a passage of extreme difficulty, and it would be impossible to notice one tithe of the explanations which have been proposed of it. We will only touch on three: (1) the natural and obvious explanation that the Apostle was here referring to a practice, prevalent in his day, of persons permitting themselves to be baptized on behalf of their dead relatives and friends. This interpretation is confirmed by the fact that Tertullian, in the third century, mentions such a practice as existing in his time. But there is great force in Robertson’s objection: “There is an immense improbability that Paul could have sustained a superstition so abject, even by an allusion. He could not have spoken of it without anger.” The custom never obtained in the Church, and though mentioned by Tertullian, is as likely to have been a consequence of this passage as its cause. Then there is (2) the suggestion of St Chrysostom, that inasmuch as baptism was a death unto sin and a resurrection unto righteousness, every one who was baptized was baptized for the dead, i.e. for himself spiritually dead in trespasses and sins; and not only for himself, but for others, inasmuch as he proclaimed openly his faith in that Resurrection of Christ which was as efficacious on others’ behalf as on his own. There remains (3) an interpretation suggested by some commentators and supported by the context, which would refer it to the baptism of trial and suffering through which the disciples of Christ were called upon to go, which would be utterly useless and absurd if it had been, and continued to be, undergone for the dying and for the dead (<span class="ital"><a href="/1_corinthians/15-6.htm" title="After that, he was seen of above five hundred brothers at once; of whom the greater part remain to this present, but some are fallen asleep.">1 Corinthians 15:6</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-18.htm" title="Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.">1 Corinthians 15:18</a></span>). The use of the present tense in the verb <span class="ital">baptized</span>, the close connection of the second member of the sentence with the first, and the use of the word baptized in this sense in St <a href="/matthew/3-11.htm" title="I indeed baptize you with water to repentance. but he that comes after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear. he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire.">Matthew 3:11</a>; <a href="/matthew/20-12.htm" title="Saying, These last have worked but one hour, and you have made them equal to us, which have borne the burden and heat of the day.">Matthew 20:12</a>, are the grounds on which this interpretation may be maintained.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/1_corinthians/15.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/1_corinthians/15-29.htm" title="Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?">1 Corinthians 15:29</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἐπεὶ τί ποήσουσιν οἱ βαπτιζόμενοι ὑπὲρ τῶν νεκρῶν</span>; <span class="greekheb">εἰ ὅλως νεκροὶ οὐκ ἐγείρονται</span>, <span class="greekheb">τί καὶ βαπτίζονται ὑπὲρ αὐτῶν</span>; <span class="greekheb">τί καὶ ἡμεῖς χινδυνεύομεν τᾶσαν ὥραν</span>;) We shall first say something on the pointing of this verse.[138] Many rightly connect, and have long been in the habit of connecting this clause, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕἸ ὍΛΩς ΝΕΚΡΟῚ ΟὐΚ ἘΓΕΊΡΟΝΤΑΙ</span></span></span>, with what follows; for the particle <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΠΕῚ</span></span></span> alone exhausts the force of the same clause in the first part of the verse. <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕἸ</span></span></span> begins the sentence, as in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-32.htm" title="If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantages it me, if the dead rise not? let us eat and drink; for to morrow we die.">1 Corinthians 15:32</a>, it does so twice; and often in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-12.htm" title="Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?">1 Corinthians 15:12</a>, and those that follow. Hence the pronoun <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΑὐΤῶΝ</span></span></span> is to be referred to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΝΕΚΡΟῚ</span></span></span>.[139] Furthermore, <span class="ital">of the baptism for</span> (<span class="ital">over</span>) <span class="ital">the dead</span>, the variety of interpretations is so great, that he who would collect, I shall not say, those different opinions, but a catalogue of the different opinions, would have to write a dissertation. At that time, as yet, there were neither martyrdoms nor baptisms over sepulchres, etc., especially at Corinth; but baptism over sepulchres, and baptism for the advantage of the dead came into use from a wrong interpretation of this very passage; as fire was used among the Egyptians and Abyssinians in the case of the baptized, from <a href="/matthew/3-11.htm" title="I indeed baptize you with water to repentance. but he that comes after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear. he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire.">Matthew 3:11</a>. Often, when the true interpretation is nearer and easier than we think, we fetch it from a distance. We must mark—I. The paraphrase: <span class="ital">Otherwise what will they do who are baptized for</span> (super) <span class="ital">the dead? If the dead rise not at all, why are they also baptized for the dead? and why also are we in danger every hour?</span> II. The sense of the phrase, <span class="greekheb">βαπτίζεσθαι ὑπὲρ τῶν νεκρῶν</span>, <span class="ital">to be baptized for</span> (<span class="ital">over</span>) <span class="ital">the dead</span>. For they are baptized <span class="ital">for</span> (over) <span class="ital">the dead</span> [super mortuis], who receive baptism and profess Christianity at that time, when they have death set before their eyes, who are likely every moment to <span class="ital">be added to the general mass of the dead</span>, either on account of the decrepitude of age, or disease, or pestilence, or by martyrdom; in fact, those who, without almost any enjoyment of this life, <span class="ital">are going down</span> to the dead, and <span class="ital">are constantly</span>, as it were, <span class="ital">hanging over</span> the dead; they who might say <span class="greekheb">קברים לי</span>, <span class="ital">the graves</span> are ready <span class="ital">for me</span>, <a href="/job/17-1.htm" title="My breath is corrupt, my days are extinct, the graves are ready for me.">Job 17:1</a>. III. The first part of the verse is of a milder character; but the last part which begins with <span class="ital">if after all</span>, has also an epitasis [an emphatic addition. Append.] expressed in its own protasis by <span class="ital">after all</span>, and in the apodosis by the <span class="ital">even</span> [<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΊ ΚΑῚ</span></span></span>]: and these two particles correspond to each other; and the same apodosis has an anaphora [the repetition of the same words in the beginnings of sections], joining its two parts by <span class="ital">why even</span>. IV. We must mark the connection of the subject under discussion. With the argument respecting the resurrection of Christ, from which our resurrection is derived, Paul connects the <span class="ital">statement</span> of two absurdities (indeed there are more than two, but the preceding absurdities are repeated, though they have been already sufficiently refuted by former reasonings) which would arise, if there be no resurrection of the dead, if Christ have not risen: and in the meantime, having disentangled the argument concerning Christ, <a href="/context/1_corinthians/15-20.htm" title="But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the first fruits of them that slept....">1 Corinthians 15:20-28</a>, he refutes those two absurdities by a <span class="ital">discussion</span> of somewhat greater length, which draws the sinews of its strength from the argument concerning Christ. The latter absurdity (for this has its relation to the argument more evident) regarding the misery of Christians in this life, he set forth at <a href="/1_corinthians/15-19.htm" title="If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.">1 Corinthians 15:19</a>, and now discusses at <a href="/1_corinthians/15-29.htm" title="Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?">1 Corinthians 15:29</a> in the middle, and in the following verses; <span class="ital">if after all:</span> and in like manner he stated the former concerning the ‘perishing’ of the Christians that are dead, at <a href="/1_corinthians/15-18.htm" title="Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.">1 Corinthians 15:18</a>, and now discusses, or repeats, or explains it in the first part of <a href="/1_corinthians/15-29.htm" title="Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?">1 Corinthians 15:29</a>. V. The force of the apostle’s argument, which in itself is both most clear and most urgent. I. The propriety of the several words consistent with themselves. <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Α</span></span></span>) <span class="ital">What shall they do?</span> is future, in respect of eternal salvation, <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, such persons being baptized, will be disappointed, their efforts will be vain, if the dead sleep the eternal sleep. <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Β</span></span></span>) The term <span class="ital">baptism</span> continues to be used in its ordinary meaning; and indeed in this epistle Paul has made more mention of baptism than in any other, ch. <a href="/context/1_corinthians/1-13.htm" title="Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were you baptized in the name of Paul?...">1 Corinthians 1:13-17</a>, <a href="/1_corinthians/10-2.htm" title="And were all baptized to Moses in the cloud and in the sea;">1 Corinthians 10:2</a>, <a href="/1_corinthians/12-13.htm" title="For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.">1 Corinthians 12:13</a>. <span class="greekheb">γ</span>) The preposition <span class="greekheb">ὑπὲρ</span> with the genitive might be thus also taken in various senses; of the object simply, as the Latins use <span class="ital">super, with respect to, about, so far as it concerns;</span> with this meaning, <span class="ital">that they may put the dead before them without consideration of the resurrection;</span> or the words may be used of paying as it were a price, viz., <span class="ital">that they should account the dead as nonentities;</span> or of obtaining as the price for their trouble, viz., <span class="ital">that they should be gathered to the dead for ever:</span> but we maintain the propriety with which <span class="greekheb">ὑπὲρ</span> denotes <span class="ital">nearness, hanging over</span> [such propinquity as that one hangs immediately over] <span class="ital">anything</span>, whence Theocritus speaks of <span class="greekheb">ἀσφόδελον τὸν ὑπὲρ γᾶς</span>, <span class="ital">the asphodel</span> (king’s spear) <span class="ital">that grows on the ground</span>, Idyl. 26. Lexicographers give more examples, especially from Thucydides. So they are baptized <span class="ital">over</span> [<span class="ital">immediately upon</span>] the dead, who will be gathered to the dead immediately after baptism: and then <span class="ital">over the dead</span> is said here, as if it were said <span class="ital">over the sepulchre</span>, as <a href="/luke/24-5.htm" title="And as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said to them, Why seek you the living among the dead?">Luke 24:5</a>, <span class="ital">with</span> [Engl. Vers., <span class="ital">among</span>] <span class="ital">the dead, i.e.</span>, in the sepulchre. Nor is it incredible, that baptism was often administered at funerals. <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Δ</span></span></span>) The term <span class="ital">dead</span> is used in its ordinary sense of the dead generally, as the article also requires, taken in as wide a sense as the resurrection, <span class="greekheb">ε</span>) The adverb <span class="greekheb">ὅλως</span>, <span class="ital">after all</span>, is used by a Corinthian who is supposed to be led on by Paul, and who had rather peevishly opposed the resurrection, not reflecting on the loss of the advantages even in this life, which result in baptism: and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕἸ ὍΛΩς</span></span></span> is employed in the same way as <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΠΕΙΔΉ ὍΛΩς</span></span></span> in Chrysost. homil. 5, c. Anomoeos: <span class="ital">Notwithstanding, though man differs little from an angel, since there is nevertheless</span> [after all] <span class="ital">some difference</span> (<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΠΕΙΔῊ ὍΛΩς ἘΣΤΊ ΤΙ ΜΈΣΟΝ</span></span></span>), <span class="ital">we know not accurately what angels are</span>. <span class="greekheb">ζ</span>) <span class="greekheb">καὶ</span> is not redundant, but strengthens the force of the present tense, <span class="greekheb">βαπτίζονται</span>, <span class="ital">what do they do who are baptized?</span> in antithesis to the future, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΊ ΠΟΙΉΣΟΥΣΙ</span></span></span>, <span class="ital">what shall they do?</span> Comp. <span class="greekheb">καὶ</span>, <a href="/2_corinthians/1-14.htm" title="As also you have acknowledged us in part, that we are your rejoicing, even as you also are our's in the day of the Lord Jesus.">2 Corinthians 1:14</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/11-12.htm" title="But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we.">2 Corinthians 11:12</a>; <a href="/context/philippians/3-7.htm" title="But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ....">Php 3:7-8</a>; <a href="/philippians/4-10.htm" title="But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me has flourished again; wherein you were also careful, but you lacked opportunity.">Php 4:10</a>. Paul in fact places those who are baptized for the dead, as it were at the point of death, and shows that no reward awaits them either for the future, if they denied the resurrection, or for the past. Paul seems to confute those who denied both the resurrection of the body and the immortality of the soul. The vindication of the former is a sufficient and more than sufficient vindication of the latter. This is an example of the <span class="greekheb">συγκατάβασις</span>, <span class="ital">condescension</span> of Scripture, which, out of regard to the weak and simple, does not enter into that subtle controversy, but lays hold of the subject at that part of it, which is easier to be proved, and yet also carries along with it the proof of the more difficult part. <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Η</span></span></span>) The two clauses beginning with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΊ</span></span></span> admirably cohere: with a gradation from those who could only for a little enjoy this life [<span class="ital">i.e.</span>, those baptized at the point of death] to (<span class="ital">us</span>) those who could enjoy it longer, if they had not had their hope fixed in Christ.—<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΝΕΚΡΟῚ</span></span></span>, <span class="ital">dead</span>) Throughout this whole chapter, in the question, <span class="ital">whether</span> [dead men rise at all], Paul speaks of dead men, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΝΕΚΡΟῪς</span></span></span>, without the article; afterwards, when this question has been cleared out of the way, in the question <span class="ital">how</span>, <a href="/1_corinthians/15-35.htm" title="But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?">1 Corinthians 15:35</a>, etc., he uses the article; but <span class="greekheb">τῶν</span> in this verse has the meaning of the relative [<span class="greekheb">τῶν νεκρῶν</span>, those <span class="ital">who</span> are dead already spoken of, <a href="/context/1_corinthians/15-12.htm" title="Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?...">1 Corinthians 15:12-13</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-16.htm" title="For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised:">1 Corinthians 15:16</a>].<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[138] Lachm. and Tischend. punctuate as Bengel.

Doubtless some of the deaths alluded to in <a href="/1_corinthians/11-30.htm">1 Corinthians 11:30</a> had happened to persons who had been cut off before they were actually baptized; and their friends had as it were gone through the rite <span class="accented">in their stead</span>, in the hope of extending to them some of its benefits. It is argued that St. Paul could not possibly mention such a practice without reprobation; but that is an <span class="accented">a priori</span> assumption not warranted by St. Paul's methods (see <a href="/1_corinthians/10-8.htm">1 Corinthians 10:8</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/11-6.htm">1 Corinthians 11:6</a>). He always confines his attention to the question immediately before him, and his present object is merely to urge a passing <span class="accented">argumentum ad hominem.</span> There is nothing at all surprising in the existence of such an abuse in the medley of wild opinions and wild practices observable in this disorganized Church. It accords with the known tendency of later times to postpone baptism, as a rite which was supposed to work as a charm. We also find that the actual practice of baptism on behalf of the dead lingered on among Corinthians (Epiph., 'Haer.,' 28:7) and Marcionites (Tertullian, 'De Resurrect.,' 48; 'Adv. Marc.,' 5:10). Tertullian accepts the words in their obvious sense in his 'De Praeser. Haer.,' 48, but accepts the absurdity of "the dead" meaning "the body" ("pro mortuis tingui est pro corporibus tingui") in his book against Marcion (5:10). St. Chrysostom tells us further that the proxy who was to be baptized used to be concealed under the bier of the dead man, who was supposed to answer in his name that he desired to be baptized. How perfectly natural the custom was may be seen from the fact that among the Jews also a man dying under ceremonial pollution was cleansed by proxy. The "interpretations" of this verse are so numerous that it is not even possible to give a catalogue of them. Many of them are not worth recording, and are only worth alluding to at all as specimens of the wilful bias which goes to Scripture, not to seek truth, but to support tradition. They are mostly futile and fantastic, because they pervert the plain meaning of the plain words. It is a waste of time and space to give perpetuity to baseless fancies. Such are the notions that "for the dead" can mean "for our mortal bodies" (Chrysostom); or "for those about to die" (Estius, Calvin, etc.); or "over (the sepulchres of) the dead" (Luther); or "to supply the vacancies left by the dead" (Le Clerc, etc.). Equally unwarrantable are the "explanations" (?) which make those who are being "baptized" mean those who are "passing through a baptism of suffering" (!). Not a single argument which is worth a moment's consideration can be urged in favour of any one of these, or scores of similar views. If we are to get rid of everything that is surprising on the ground that it is "immensely improbable," we may as well discard Scripture at once, and reconstruct early Christian history out of our own consciousness. It has been very usual to represent it as we think that it ought to have been, and not as it was. The disuse of this vicarious baptism among orthodox Christians may have been due to the discouragement of it by St. Paul when he went to Corinth, and "set in order" various erroneous customs (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-34.htm">1 Corinthians 11:34</a>). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/1_corinthians/15.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>What shall they do (&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;)<p>What will they effect or accomplish.

None of the explanations proposed are free from objection. Paul is evidently alluding to a usage familiar to his readers; and the term employed was, as Godet remarks, in their vocabulary, a sort of technical phrase. A large number of both ancient and modern commentators adopt the view that a living Christian was baptized for an unbaptized dead Christian. The Greek expositors regarded the words the dead as equivalent to the resurrection of the dead, and the baptism as a manifestation of belief in the doctrine of the resurrection. Godet adopts the explanation which refers baptism to martyrdom - the baptism of blood - and cites <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/12-50.htm">Luke 12:50</a>, and <a href="/mark/10-38.htm">Mark 10:38</a>. In the absence of anything more satisfactory I adopt the explanation given above. </body></html>
