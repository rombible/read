at all events, the freedom which it expresses was very dear to him, and it may have been misused by some as an argument for universal license. St. Paul, therefore, boldly repeats it, and proceeds to show that it is a maxim of Christian liberty, which does not refer to matters which are absolutely wrong, and that even in its application to indifferent matters it must be limited, and guarded by other Christian principles. “The eating of things sacrificed to idols (see Note on <a href="/1_corinthians/8-4.htm" title="As concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is none other God but one.">1Corinthians 8:4</a>), and the committing fornication,” were two subjects of discussion closely connected with heathen worship; and it may seem astonishing to us now that because St. Paul had maintained the right of individual liberty concerning the former, he should perhaps have been quoted as an authority for liberty regarding the latter, yet it is a matter of fact that such a mode of reasoning was not uncommon. They were both regarded as part and parcel of heathen worship, and therefore, as it were, to stand or fall together, as being matters vital or indifferent. (See <a href="/acts/15-29.htm" title="That you abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication: from which if you keep yourselves, you shall do well. Fare you well.">Acts 15:29</a>, and <a href="/revelation/11-14.htm" title="The second woe is past; and, behold, the third woe comes quickly.">Revelation 11:14</a>, as illustrations of the union of the two for purposes respectively of condemnation and of improper toleration.) We must not regard the use of the singular “me” as being in any sense a limitation of the principle to the Apostle personally. “Paul often speaks in the first person singular, which has the force of a moral maxim, especially in this Epistle (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-15.htm" title="Know you not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid.">1Corinthians 6:15</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/7-7.htm" title="For I would that all men were even as I myself. But every man has his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that.">1Corinthians 7:7</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/8-13.htm" title="Why, if meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while the world stands, lest I make my brother to offend.">1Corinthians 8:13</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/10-23.htm" title="All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but all things edify not.">1Corinthians 10:23</a>; <a href="/context/1_corinthians/10-29.htm" title="Conscience, I say, not your own, but of the other: for why is my liberty judged of another man's conscience?">1Corinthians 10:29-30</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/14-11.htm" title="Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be to him that speaks a barbarian, and he that speaks shall be a barbarian to me.">1Corinthians 14:11</a>)” (Bengel). The words refer to all Christians.<p><span class= "bld">All things are not expedient.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">all things are not profitable.</span> The word “expedient” in its highest sense is a proper translation of the Greeks, but in modern use it has a somewhat lower and depreciatory meaning generally attached to it.<p><span class= "bld">All things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.</span>—There is a verbal contrast in the Greek here which can scarcely be rendered fully in English. The Greek words for “unlawful” and “be brought under the power of” are cognate words. What the Apostle says is, “All things are lawful for me, but I am not the one to allow them therefore to become a law over me.” There is such a thing as becoming the very slave of liberty itself. If we sacrifice the power of choice which is implied in the thought of liberty, we cease to be free; we are brought <span class= "ital">under</span> the power of that which should be <span class= "ital">in</span> our power.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_corinthians/6.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/1_corinthians/6-12.htm" title="All things are lawful to me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any....">1 Corinthians 6:12-14</a></span>. <span class="ital">All things </span>— That are indifferent in their own nature, and neither commanded nor forbidden; <span class="ital">are lawful unto me </span>— Or, as some paraphrase the clause, <span class="ital">All things which are lawful for you are lawful for me. </span>Since the apostle could not say, in any sense, that absolutely all things were lawful for him, the sentence must be considered as elliptical, and what is wanting to complete it must be supplied, according to the apostle’s manner, from the subsequent verse. <span class="ital">But all things are not expedient </span>— Proper to be used, in regard of circumstances; as when they would offend our weak brethren, or when they would enslave our own souls. Although <span class="ital">all things </span>— Of the above description; <span class="ital">are lawful for me, </span>yet <span class="ital">I will not be brought under the power of any </span>— So enslaved to any thing, as to be uneasy when I abstain from it, for in that case I should be under the power of it. <span class="ital">Meats for the belly, </span>&c. — As if he had said, I speak this chiefly with regard to meats; particularly with regard to those offered to idols, and those forbidden in the Mosaic law.

This dangerous conceit St. Paul opposes. There is a liberty wherewith Christ has made us free, in which we must stand fast. But surely a Christian would never put himself into the power of any bodily appetite. The body is for the Lord; is to be an instrument of righteousness to holiness, therefore is never to be made an instrument of sin. It is an honour to the body, that Jesus Christ was raised from the dead; and it will be an honour to our bodies, that they will be raised. The hope of a resurrection to glory, should keep Christians from dishonouring their bodies by fleshly lusts. And if the soul be united to Christ by faith, the whole man is become a member of his spiritual body. Other vices may be conquered in fight; that here cautioned against, only by flight. And vast multitudes are cut off by this vice in its various forms and consequences. Its effects fall not only directly upon the body, but often upon the mind. Our bodies have been redeemed from deserved condemnation and hopeless slavery by the atoning sacrifice of Christ. We are to be clean, as vessels fitted for our Master's use. Being united to Christ as one spirit, and bought with a price of unspeakable value, the believer should consider himself as wholly the Lord's, by the strongest ties. May we make it our business, to the latest day and hour of our lives, to glorify God with our bodies, and with our spirits which are his.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>All things are lawful unto me - The apostle here evidently makes a transition to another subject from that which he had been discussing - a consideration of the propriety of using certain things which had been esteemed lawful. The expression, "all things are lawful," is to be understood as used by those who palliated certain indulgences, or who vindicated the vices here referred to, and Paul designs to reply to them. His reply follows. He had been reproving them for their vices, and had specified several. It is not to be supposed that they would indulge in them without some show of defense; and the declaration here has much the appearance of a proverb, or a common saying - that all things were lawful; that is, "God has formed all things for our use, and there can be no evil if we use them." By the phrase "all things" here, perhaps, may be meant many things; or things in general; or there is nothing in itself unlawful.<p>That there were many vicious persons who held this sentiment there can be no doubt; and though it cannot be supposed that there were any in the Christian church who would openly advocate it, yet the design of Paul was to "cut up" the plea altogether "wherever it might be urged," and to show that it was false and unfounded. The particular flyings which Paul here refers to, are those which have been called "adiaphoristic," or indifferent; that is, pertaining to certain meats and drinks, etc. With this Paul connects also the subject of fornication - the subject particularly under discussion. This was defended as "lawful," by many Greeks, and was practiced at Corinth; and was the vice to which the Corinthian Christians were particularly exposed. Paul designed to meet all that could be said on this subject; and to show them that these indulgences could not be proper for Christians, and could not in any way be defended - We are not to understand Paul as admitting that fornication is in any case lawful; but he designs to show that the practice cannot possibly be defended in any way, or by any of the arguments which had been or could be used. For this purpose, he observes:<p>(1) That admitting that all things were lawful, there were many things which ought not to be indulged;<p>(2) That admitting that they were lawful, yet a man ought not to be under the power of any improper indulgence, and should abandon any habit when it had the mastery.<p>(3) that fornication was positively wrong, and against the very nature and essence of Christianity, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-13.htm">1 Corinthians 6:13-20</a>.<p>Are not expedient - This is the first answer to the objection. Even should we admit that the practices under discussion are lawful, yet there are many things which are not expedient; that is, which do not profit, for so the word &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;  sumpherei properly signifies; they are injurious and hurtful. They might injure the body; produce scandal; lead others to offend or to sin. Such was the case with regard to the use of certain meats, and even with regard to the use of wine. Paul's rule on this subject is stated in <a href="/1_corinthians/8-13.htm">1 Corinthians 8:13</a>. That if these things did injury to others, he would abandon them forever; even though they were in themselves lawful; see the <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8.htm">1 Corinthians 8</a> note and <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/14-14.htm">Romans 14:14-23</a> notes. There are many customs which, perhaps, cannot be strictly proved to be unlawful or sinful, which yet do injury in some way if indulged in; and which as their indulgence can do no good, should be abandoned. Anything that does evil - however small - and no good, should be abandoned at once.<p>All things are lawful - Admitting this; or even on the supposition that all things are in themselves right.<p>But I will not be brought under the power - I will not be subdued by it; I will not become the "slave" of it.<p>Of any - Of any custom, or habit, no matter what it is. This was Paul's rule; the rule of an independent mind. The principle was, that even admitting that certain things were in themselves right, yet his grand purpose was "not to be the slave of habit," not to be subdued by any practice that might corrupt his mind, fetter his energies, or destroy his freedom as a man and as a Christian. We may observe:<p>(1) That this is a good rule to act on. It was Paul's rule <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-27.htm">1 Corinthians 9:27</a>, and it will do as well for us as for him.<p>(2) it is the true rule of an independent and noble mind. It requires a high order of virtue; and is the only way in which a man may be useful and active.<p>(3) it may be applied to "many things" now. Many a Christian and Christian minister "is a slave;" and is completely under the power of some habit that destroys his usefulness and happiness. He is the slave of indolence, or carelessness, or of some vile habit - as the use of tobacco, or of wine. He has not independence enough to break the cords that bind him; and the consequence is, that life is passed in indolence, or in self-indulgence, and time, and strength, and property are wasted, and religion blighted, and souls ruined.<p>(4) the man that has not courage and firmness enough to act on this rule should doubt his piety. If he is a voluntary slave to some idle and mischievous habit, how can he be a Christian! If he does not love his Saviour and the souls of people enough to break off from such habits which he knows are doing injury, how is he fit to be a minister of the self-denying Redeemer? <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>1Co 6:12-20. Refutation of the Antinomian Defense of Fornication as if It Was Lawful Because Meats Are So.<p>12. All things are lawful unto me&#8212;These, which were Paul's own words on a former occasion (to the Corinthians, compare 1Co 10:23, and Ga 5:23), were made a pretext for excusing the eating of meats offered to idols, and so of what was generally connected with idolatry (Ac 15:29), "fornication" (perhaps in the letter of the Corinthians to Paul, 1Co 7:1). Paul's remark had referred only to things indifferent: but they wished to treat fornication as such, on the ground that the existence of bodily appetites proved the lawfulness of their gratification.<p>me&#8212;Paul giving himself as a sample of Christians in general.<p>but I&#8212;whatever others do, I will not, &c.<p>lawful &#8230; brought under the power&#8212;The Greek words are from the same root, whence there is a play on the words: All things are in my power, but I will not be brought under the power of any of them (the "all things"). He who commits "fornication," steps aside from his own legitimate power or liberty, and is "brought under the power" of an harlot (1Co 6:15; compare 1Co 7:4). The "power" ought to be in the hands of the believer, not in the things which he uses [Bengel]; else his liberty is forfeited; he ceases to be his own master (Joh 8:34-36; Ga 5:13; 1Pe 2:16; 2Pe 2:19). Unlawful things ruin thousands; "lawful" things (unlawfully used), ten thousands.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_corinthians/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The words of this text are not so difficult in themselves, as it is to make out the connection they have with, and the dependence they have upon, what went before and what followeth after. Some, thinking that they refer unto what the apostle had said before about their going to law before infidels in the first seven verses, lest any should say: Is it not then lawful for men to sue at law for their just dues and rights? The apostle answers: Admit it be, yet Christians ought not only to consider what is strictly lawful and just, but they ought to consider circumstances; for: <span class="ital">Quicquid non expedit, in quantum non expedit non licet, </span> is an old and good rule; An action that is in itself lawful, may be by circumstances made sinful and unlawful; and that was the case as to the Christians going to law before infidels. But others, and those the most, think that the apostle here begins a new head of discourse to dissuade from the sin of fornication, and from an intemperate use of meat and drink, as being provocative of lust, and disposing them to that sin. Now, lest they should say, Is it not lawful then to eat and drink liberally, must we eat and drink for bare necessity? He answereth: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">All things are lawful for me; </span> that is, all things which are not forbidden by the law of God may be used, may be done, under fair circumstances; but circumstances may alter the case, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">all things</span> may not be <span class="bld">expedient</span> to be used or done by all persons, or at all times. The Corinthians might possibly conclude too much from what he had told them, that they were <span class="ital">washed, justified, </span> and <span class="ital">sanctified, </span> viz. that now all things were lawful to them, at least all things not simply and absolutely condemned in the word of God: the apostle correcteth their mistake, by telling them they were to have a regard to expedience, and the profit of others, the neglect of which might make things that were in themselves lawful to become unlawful. Besides that, they must take heed that they did not make such a use, even of lawful things, as to <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">be brought under the power of</span> them; which men are, when they become potent temptations to them to sin against God any way. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_corinthians/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>All things are lawful unto me,.... That is, which are of an indifferent nature; otherwise everything is not lawful to be done: <p>but all things are not expedient; when the doing of them destroys the peace, comfort, and edification of others; when it stumbles and grieves weak minds, and causes offence to them; see <a href="/1_corinthians/10-23.htm">1 Corinthians 10:23</a><p>all things are lawful for me; which is repeated for the sake of saying the following words: <p>but I will not be brought under the power of any; which would be very inexpedient, should any by the use of liberty in things indifferent, on the one hand, offend his brethren, and, on the other, bring himself into bondage to those very things he has the free use of; and therefore the apostle determines, that these shall not have the mastery over him, that he will use them, or not use them, at his pleasure. It is somewhat difficult to know what in particular he has respect unto, whether to what he had been treating of before, concerning going to law before unbelievers; and his sense be, that however lawful this might be in itself, yet it was not expedient, since it was exposing of themselves to ungodly persons, and a putting themselves under their power to judge and determine as they pleased; or whether to the use of meats forbidden under the law, or offered to idols; which though in themselves lawful to be eaten, every creature of God being good, and not to be refused and accounted common and unclean; yet it was not expedient to use this liberty, if a weak brother should be grieved, or a man himself become a slave to his appetite. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_corinthians/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{9}</span> <span class="cverse3">{g}</span> All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the <span class="cverse3">{h}</span> power of any.</span><p>(9) Secondly, he shows that the Corinthians offend in small matters. First, because they abused them. Next, because they used indifferent things, without any discretion, seeing the use of them ought to be brought to the rule of charity.

But Corinthian Epicureanism, starting from the Hellenic mode of viewing this matter, which was altogether very lax (Herm. <span class="ital">Privatalterth</span>., § 29. 13 ff.), easily found for itself even a certain justification of fornication, namely, in the doctrine of Christian <span class="ital">liberty in adiaphoris</span>, the maxim of which is: <span class="greekheb">πάντα μοι ἔξεστιν</span>. Now we may infer from the passage before us that this erroneous justification had <span class="ital">actually</span> been brought forward, that more than one voluptuary in the church had, as Paul was informed, actually declared that just as satisfying the desire for food was an <span class="ital">adiaphoron</span>, so also was satisfying the desire for sensual pleasure by fornication. Comp Baur in the <span class="ital">theol. Jahrb.</span> 1852, 1 and 3; Weiss, <span class="ital">bibl. Theol.</span> p. 420 f. Olshausen, indeed, thinks that Paul would have given an absolute command to exclude all such persons from the church, and that therefore it is only the <span class="ital">possibility</span> of so gross an abuse of Christian liberty that is implied here. But the former is an arbitrary assumption,[953] and the latter has these two considerations against it—first, that in no other Epistle does Paul touch on this possibility, although the opinion that licentious intercourse was allowable was widely spread among the Greeks and Romans; and secondly, that the statement of the moral difference between the use of meats and whoredom is of too special a kind to be naturally accounted for in the absence of actual occasion. Neander, whose objections lose their force, if we only do not go the length of assuming that this adiaphoristic view of fornication had become universal in Corinth, or had been formally published and propagated there as a doctrinal tenet, is of opinion that Paul meant to begin here upon the theme of meat offered to idols (comp <a href="/1_corinthians/10-23.htm" title="All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but all things edify not.">1 Corinthians 10:23</a>), but was led on after the first half of <a href="/1_corinthians/6-13.htm" title="Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.">1 Corinthians 6:13</a> to draw a contrast (perhaps in order to guard against a misunderstanding of his words, perhaps also in opposition to those who denied the resurrection) which conducted him so far away from his theme, that it was only in chap. 8 that he made his way back to it again from another point. But how arbitrary this is! And how entirely unexampled a thing, that the apostle should so far forget himself, and write in a manner so irregular and open to misconception! Chap. <a href="/1_corinthians/10-23.htm" title="All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but all things edify not.">1 Corinthians 10:23</a> lends no support to this exposition, for it is obvious that the same maxim could be made to apply in very many different directions. Rückert’s exegesis is only a little less violent; he supposes that, in the question addressed to the apostle about the sacrificial meat, the party eating it had adduced the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΆΝΤΑ ἜΞΕΣΤΙΝ</span></span></span> in their favour, and that Paul had only <span class="ital">transferred it here in order to guard against the abuse of it respecting fornication</span> (in substance, therefore, coinciding with Olshausen). To the ordinary interpretation Rückert objects, that the Corinthians in their letter would certainly not have described the <span class="greekheb">πορνεία</span> as prevailing among them, nor would they have undertaken the defence of it to the apostle whom they knew so well. But this objection is unfounded; for from <a href="/1_corinthians/5-1.htm" title="It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife.">1 Corinthians 5:1</a> we must assume that Paul had come to know of the state of morals at Corinth through <span class="ital">oral</span> reports, and consequently had not learned the abuse there made of the <span class="greekheb">πάντα ἔξεστιν</span> through expressions in the Corinthian <span class="ital">letter</span> (this against Hofmann also). According to Ewald, there had been doubts and debates concerning the obligation of the Jewish laws about <span class="ital">food</span> and <span class="ital">marriage</span>; Paul therefore lays down in <a href="/1_corinthians/6-12.htm" title="All things are lawful to me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.">1 Corinthians 6:12</a> the principle which should decide all such cases, and then at once, in <a href="/1_corinthians/6-13.htm" title="Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them.

THE SANCTITY OF THE BODY, The laxity of morals distinguishing the Cor[964] Church was in some instances defended, or half-excused, by appealing to the principle of <span class="ital">Christian liberty</span>, which P. had himself enunciated in asserting the freedom of Gentile Christians from the Mosaic ceremonial restrictions. From his lips the libertarians took their motto, <span class="greekheb">Πάντα μοι ἔξεστιν</span>. The Ap. does not retract this sentence, but he guards it from abuse: (1) by setting over against it the balancing principle of <span class="ital">expediency</span>, <span class="greekheb">οὐ πάντα συμφέρει</span>; (2) by defining, in the twofold example of <a href="/1_corinthians/6-13.htm" title="Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them.

This leads up to a reiterated prohibition of fornication, grounded on its nature as a sin against the body itself, and an act which flagrantly contradicts the sanctity of its limbs, as they belong to Christ, being purchased by Him for the service of God (<a href="/context/1_corinthians/6-15.htm" title="Know you not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot?

The guilt of the Fornicator<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">12</span>. <span class="ital">All things are lawful unto me</span>] In this and the next two verses the main argument of the rest of the Epistle is sketched out, though not in the order afterwards followed by the Apostle. At present he takes them in the order of their importance. First he touches on the comparatively unimportant question of the distinction of meats, treated of at length in ch. 8, 10. Then he alludes to the relations of the sexes, the subject of ch. <a href="/1_corinthians/6-12.htm" title="All things are lawful to me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.">1 Corinthians 6:12</a> to <a href="/1_corinthians/7-40.htm" title="But she is happier if she so abide, after my judgment: and I think also that I have the Spirit of God.">1 Corinthians 7:40</a>. And lastly he speaks of the great doctrine of the Resurrection, which stands in a close practical relation to the two former, and which is dealt with in ch. 15. The words in this verse appear to have become a watchword with some among the Corinthian Christians. Starting from the doctrine of Christian liberty taught by Christ (St <a href="/john/8-32.htm" title="And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.">John 8:32</a>; <a href="/john/8-36.htm" title="If the Son therefore shall make you free, you shall be free indeed.">John 8:36</a>), and proclaimed with one mouth by His Apostles (<a href="/romans/8-2.htm" title="For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death.">Romans 8:2</a>; <a href="/james/2-12.htm" title="So speak you, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.">James 2:12</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-16.htm" title="As free, and not using your liberty for a cloak of maliciousness, but as the servants of God.">1 Peter 2:16</a>), they declared that the Christian was bound to a ‘service’ which was ‘perfect freedom.’ St Paul accepts the principle, but with limitations. No actions were <span class="ital">in themselves</span> unlawful, he was ready to admit, provided (1) that they were in accordance with God’s design in creation; (2) that they were calculated to promote the general welfare of mankind; and (3) that we were masters of our actions, not they of us. Bengel well remarks: “Sæpe Paulus prima persona eloquitur quæ vim habent gnomes in hac præsertim epistola. <a href="/1_corinthians/6-15.htm" title="Know you not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot?

Its opposite, that which entangles us, is similarly called an <span class="ital">impediment</span>, Cf. the word <span class="ital">speed</span>. The sense “that which is advisable for the sake of some personal advantage,” “expedient” as opposed to what is based on principle, is a more modern sense of the word. Hence the meaning here is <span class="ital">profitable:</span> i.e. for others as well as ourselves. Cf. ch. <a href="/1_corinthians/7-35.htm" title="And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare on you, but for that which is comely, and that you may attend on the Lord without distraction.">1 Corinthians 7:35</a>, <a href="/1_corinthians/10-33.htm" title="Even as I please all men in all things, not seeking my own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved.">1 Corinthians 10:33</a>, where the derivative of the verb here used is translated ‘profit.’ Robertson gives a valuable practical illustration of the principle here laid down. “In the North on Sunday, men will not sound an instrument of music, or take a walk except to a place of worship. Suppose that an English Christian found himself in some Highland village, what would be his duty? ‘All things are lawful’ for him. By the law of Christian liberty he is freed from bondage to meats and drinks, to holidays or Sabbath days; but if his use of this his Christian liberty should shock his brother Christians, or become an excuse for the less conscientious among them to follow his example, <span class="ital">against</span> the dictates of their own conscience, then it would be his Christian duty to abridge his own liberty, because the use of it would be inexpedient,” or rather, unprofitable.

The believer establishes this principle in respect of himself: he says in respect of his neighbour, <span class="ital">all things do not edify</span>, <a href="/1_corinthians/10-23.htm" title="All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but all things edify not.">1 Corinthians 10:23</a>.—<span class="greekheb">τινὸς</span>) <span class="ital">any thing</span> Neuter, the same as <span class="greekheb">πάντα</span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12-20.</span> - <span class="accented">The inexcusable sin and shame of fornication.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All things are lawful unto me.</span> The abruptness with which the phrase is introduced perhaps shows that, in the letter of the Corinthians to St. Paul, they had used some such expression by way of palliating their lax tolerance of violations of the law of purity. By "all things," of course, is only meant "all things which are indifferent in themselves." They erroneously applied this maxim of Christian liberty to that which was inherently sinful, and thus were tempted to "make their liberty a cloak of viciousness." St. Paul, as Bengel observes, often, and especially in this Epistle, uses the first person <span class="accented">generally</span> in gnomic or semi-proverbial sentences (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-15.htm">1 Corinthians 6:15</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/7-7.htm">1 Corinthians 7:7</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/10-23.htm">1 Corinthians 10:23, 29, 30</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/14-11.htm">1 Corinthians 14:11</a>). But. This is St. Paul's correction of too broad a formula. <span class="cmt_word">Are not expedient.</span> St. Paul illustrates this in <a href="/1_corinthians/8-8.htm">1 Corinthians 8:8-10</a>. We have no right to do even that which is innocent, if it be disadvantageous to the highest interests of ourselves or others. "He alone," says St. Augustine, "does not fall into unlawful things who sometimes abstains by way of caution even from lawful ones." <span class="cmt_word">Will</span> <span class="cmt_word">not be brought under the power.</span> The play of words in the original might be imitated by saying, "All things are in my power, but I will not be brought under the power of any." In other words, "boundless intemperance" may become a tyranny. The pretence of moral freedom may end in a moral bondage. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Obedience is better than freedom? What's free?<br />The vexed foam on the wave, the tossed straw on the sea;<br />The ocean itself, as it rages and swells,<br />In the bonds of a boundless obedience dwells."</span> I will be master even over my liberty by keeping it under the beneficent control of law and of charity. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/1_corinthians/6.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Are lawful (&#x3b5;&#788;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;)<p>There is a play between this word and &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; be brought under the power, which can hardly be accurately conveyed to the English reader.
