Jewish converts would have more easily understood that they should settle disputes among themselves, as the Roman power had, as we learn from Gallio’s remarks (<a href="/context/acts/18-14.htm" title="And when Paul was now about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O you Jews, reason would that I should bear with you:">Acts 18:14-15</a>), given this liberty to the Jews. The Gentile converts, however, would have been naturally inclined to continue to bring disputes before the tribunals with which they had been so familiar in a proverbially litigious condition of society before their conversion. We can well imagine how detrimental to the best interests of Christianity it would be for the Christian communion, founded as it was on principles of unity and love, to be perpetually, through the hasty temper and weakness of individual members, held up to the scorn of the heathen, as a scene of intestine strife. Repeated lawsuits before heathen judges would have had the further evil effect of practically obliterating the broad line of demarcation which then really existed between the principles of Roman jurisprudence, and the loftier Christian conceptions of self-sacrifice and charity by which the followers of Jesus Christ should, in accordance with His teaching, control their life. These considerations rendered necessary the warnings which the Apostle here commences with the emphatic word “Dare,” of which it has been well said (Bengel), “Treason against Christians is denoted by this high-sounding word.”<p><span class= "bld">Unjust . . . . saints.</span>—These words convey here no essentially moral ideas. They merely signify respectively “heathen” and “members of the Christian Church.” These phrases remind us that the state of things when St. Paul wrote this was entirely different from what exists in any Christian country now. The teaching has nothing whatever to do with the adjudication of the courts of a Christian country. The cases to which St. Paul’s injunctions would be applicable in the present day would be possible only in a heathen country. If, for example, in India there existed heathen tribunals, it would certainly be wrong, and a source of grave scandal, for native Christians to submit questions between themselves for decision to such courts, instead of bringing them before the legal tribunals established by Christian England. It is not probable that at so early a period there were any regular and recognised tribunals amongst the Christians, and certainly their decisions could scarcely have had any legal force. There is, however, historical evidence of the existence of such in the middle of the second century. The principles here laid down would naturally have led to their establishment. (See <a href="/1_corinthians/5-4.htm" title="In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when you are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,">1Corinthians 5:4</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_corinthians/6.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/1_corinthians/6-1.htm" title="Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints?...">1 Corinthians 6:1-6</a></span>. The apostle, having mentioned one very great irregularity among the professors of Christianity at Corinth, proceeds now to animadvert upon another, namely, their entering into suits of law with each other in heathen courts: <span class="ital">Dare any of you </span>— Have you so little regard for the glory of God, and the credit of Christianity, that, <span class="ital">having a matter against another </span>— Any controversy about civil affairs; you <span class="ital">go to law before the unjust — </span>Heathen judges, who generally were very corrupt, and from whom a Christian could expect no justice: <span class="ital">and not before the saints</span> — Who might easily decide these smaller differences in a private and friendly manner. <span class="ital">Do ye not know </span>— This expression occurs six times in this single chapter, and that with a peculiar force: for the Corinthians knew, and gloried in their knowledge, but their conduct was not consistent therewith. <span class="ital">That the saints </span>— After having been judged themselves; <span class="ital">shall judge the world — </span>Shall be assessors with Christ in the judgment wherein he shall condemn all the wicked, as well angels as men, <a href="/matthew/19-28.htm" title="And Jesus said to them, Truly I say to you, That you which have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, you also shall sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.">Matthew 19:28</a>; <a href="/revelation/20-4.htm" title="And I saw thrones, and they sat on them, and judgment was given to them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark on their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.">Revelation 20:4</a>. <span class="ital">And if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy </span>— Unfit, unable for such a work; <span class="ital">to judge the smallest matters</span> — Differences about worldly affairs, which are of small moment, in comparison of spiritual and heavenly matters. <span class="ital">Know ye not that we shall judge angels? </span>— Namely, evil angels: as Christ is their judge, we shall be honoured to join with him in that judgment also, when all his enemies shall be put under his feet and ours. <span class="ital">How much more </span>are ye fit to decide in these low and transitory secular affairs? <span class="ital">If then ye have judgments </span>— Differences to be decided; <span class="ital">of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church — </span>Even the weakest among you might be adequate to that work, and certainly fitter for it than unjust heathen. <span class="ital">I speak to your shame </span>— To make you ashamed of your proceedings. The apostle certainly did not seriously design that they should set persons to judge in these matters, (though of little importance, in comparison of spiritual things,) who were the weakest and of least esteem among them, as appears from the next clause; but he spoke ironically. <span class="ital">Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you </span>— Among you who are such admirers of wisdom, who is wise enough to decide in such causes? <span class="ital">Not one able to judge between his brethren </span>— In those disputes which they have about earthly things? <span class="ital">But brother goeth to law with brother </span>— One Christian with another; <span class="ital">and that before the unbelievers </span>— To the great discredit of the Christian name; yea, to the scandal of the whole Christian institution; for they cannot but take occasion, from your mutual quarrels and accusations, to brand the whole body of you as injurious and avaricious; who, while you pretend to be so far superior to secular views, are yet so strongly attached to them, that, with all your professions of universal benevolence and brotherly love, you cannot forbear wronging one another.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:1-8 Christians should not contend with one another, for they are brethren. This, if duly attended to, would prevent many law-suits, and end many quarrels and disputes. In matters of great damage to ourselves or families, we may use lawful means to right ourselves, but Christians should be of a forgiving temper. Refer the matters in dispute, rather than go to law about them. They are trifles, and may easily be settled, if you first conquer your own spirits. Bear and forbear, and the men of least skill among you may end your quarrels. It is a shame that little quarrels should grow to such a head among Christians, that they cannot be determined by the brethren. The peace of a man's own mind, and the calm of his neighbourhood, are worth more than victory. Lawsuits could not take place among brethren, unless there were faults among them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Dare any of you - The reasons why the apostle introduced this subject here may have been:<p>(1) That he had mentioned the subject of judging <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-13.htm">1 Corinthians 5:13</a>, and that naturally suggested the topic which is here introduced; and,<p>(2) This might have been a prevailing evil in the church of Corinth, and demanded correction. The word "dare" here implies that it was inconsistent with religion, and improper. "can you do it; is it proper or right; or do you presume so far to violate all the principles of Christianity as to do it."<p>Having a matter - A subject of litigation; or a suit. There may be differences between people in regard to property and right, in which there shall be no blame on either side. They may both be desirous of having it equitably and amicably adjusted. It is not a difference between people that is in itself wrong, but it is the spirit with which the difference is adhered to, and the unwillingness to have justice done that is so often wrong.<p>Against another - Another member of the congregation. A Christian brother. The apostle here directs his reproof against the "plaintiff," as having the choice of the tribunal before which he would bring the cause.<p>Before the unjust - The pagan tribunals; for the word "unjust" here evidently stands opposed to the saints. The apostle does not mean that they were always unjust in their decisions, or that equity could in no case be hoped from them, but that they were classed in that division of the world which was different from the saints, and is synonymous with unbelieveRS, as opposed to believers.<p>And not before the saints - Before Christians. Can you not settle your differences among yourselves as Christians, by leaving the cause to your brethren, as arbitrators, instead of going before pagan magistrates? The Jews would not allow any of their causes to be brought before the Gentile courts. Their rule was this, "He that tries a cause before the judges of the Gentiles, and before their tribunals, although their judgments are as the judgments of the Israelites, so this is an ungodly man," etc. Maimon, Hilch, Sanhedrin, chapter 26 section 7. They even looked upon such an action as bad as profaning the name of God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 6<p>1Co 6:1-11.

The apostle speaks of this as a thing which he wondered that they durst be guilty of, that they should be no more tender of the glory of God in the reputation of the Christian religion, and should not rather choose arbitrators amongst the members of their church, to hear and determine such differences as arose amongst them, than give pagans an occasion to reproach the Christian religion for the contentions and feuds of Christians. The reputation of the gospel and the professors of it being the thing for which Paul was here concerned, and upon the account of which he thus speaketh; it becometh Christians yet to consider, whether what he saith concerneth not them, where either the judges, or the generality of the auditors in such judgments, may probably reproach religion, or that way of God which they own, for their trivial and uncharitable contentions. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_corinthians/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Dare any of you, having a matter against another,...., Any thing in difference, an action, cause, or suit. The apostle having dispatched the affair of the incestuous person, and blamed this church for their conduct therein: and having given them instructions what they should do, proceeds to lay before them another evil among them he had to complain of; which was, when any difference arose among them about their worldly concerns, they would <p>go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints; a method of proceeding condemned by the Jews, who would not suffer any causes of theirs to be tried before Gentiles, only before Israelites; their canon runs thus (u), <p>"he that tries a cause before the judges of the Gentiles, and before their tribunals, although their judgments are as the judgments of the Israelites, lo, this is an ungodly man; and it is as if he blasphemed and reproached, and lift up his hand against the law of Moses our master, as it is said, <a href="/exodus/21-1.htm">Exodus 21:1</a> now these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them,  , "and not before the Gentiles";  , "and not before idiots", private or illiterate men.'' <p>They looked upon such an action as bad as profaning the name of God; hence they say (w), <p>"we must not try a cause in the courts of the Gentiles, for they come from the strength of judgment; this is Esau an hairy man, for they have no concord nor mercy--and he that comes before thee , "profanes the name of God", who is gracious and merciful, and honours the name of an idol--wherefore he that brings a cause before the Gentiles, is the occasion of spreading the property of judgment in the world----therefore let a cause be tried before the Israelites, for they are the secret of mercy, and not before the Gentiles, nor before idiots:'' <p>they affirm (x) it to be a greater sin than murder, and that not only profanations of the name of God, but rapine and violence are comprehended in it; and that to give evidence in an Heathen court against an Israelite, deserves excommunication; for so it is said, (y). <p>"he that bears witness against an Israelite  , "in the courts of the Gentiles", and by his testimony gets money from him, which is not according to the judgment of the Israelites, they excommunicate him until he repays it.'' <p>Again (z). <p>"it is forbidden to order causes in the courts of (the rest of the nations) idolaters, for they have no part in the side of our faith.'' <p>The apostle here dissuades from this practice, of going to law before Heathen magistrates, not only from its being an imprudent, but an impudent, "daring", rash and adventurous action; and seems surprised that any should attempt it, when it must unavoidably expose their weaknesses and faults to their enemies; nor could they expect justice to be done them by men of such a character, as "unjust", who neither feared God, nor regarded men; were not only destitute of righteousness, but filled with all unrighteousness, and had not so much as the principles of common justice and equity in them; when on the contrary, from the saints, men who have the principles of grace and holiness wrought in them, and live soberly, righteously, and godly, who have the fear of God before their eyes, and upon their hearts; they might reasonably conclude, were matters brought before them, they would be adjusted according to judgment and truth, without exposing the sin and weakness of any party to the world. <p>(u) Maimon.

Instead of being repressed by timely correction, the evil had grown rank; in several instances aggrieved Christian parties had carried their complaints before the civil Courts, to the scandal of the Church and to Paul’s high indignation. Two links of thought connect chh. 5. and 6.: (1) the kindred nature of <span class="ital">sins of impurity and of covetousness</span>, both prevalent at Cor[888], both destructive of society; (2) the lamentable <span class="ital">lack of Church discipline</span> (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-12.htm" title="For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not you judge them that are within?">1 Corinthians 5:12</a>), which enabled these mischiefs to gather head.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[887] Corinth, Corinthian or Corinthians.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[888] Corinth, Corinthian or Corinthians.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/1_corinthians/6.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>Ch. <a href="/context/1_corinthians/6-1.htm" title="Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints?...">1 Corinthians 6:1-11</a>. The way to settle disputes in the Christian Church<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">1</span>. <span class="ital">Dare any of you, having a matter against another</span>] The principle is here laid down which is to guide Christians in their lawsuits. Disputes about property are treated by the Apostle as matters of the most trifling import. To call in the unbelievers to settle the disputes of Christian brethren was an act of audacity almost inconceivable by the Apostle (<span class="ital"><a href="/1_corinthians/6-1.htm" title="Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints?">1 Corinthians 6:1</a></span>), and in marked contrast to the feeling prevalent in the Christian Church at its first foundation (<a href="/acts/4-32.htm" title="And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul: neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common.">Acts 4:32</a>). It were far better for a Christian to suffer the utmost wrong, than to bring such a reproach upon the name of Christ (<span class="ital"><a href="/1_corinthians/6-7.htm" title="Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because you go to law one with another. Why do you not rather take wrong? why do you not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?">1 Corinthians 6:7</a></span>). The disputes of Christians were therefore settled by private arbitration, a custom which continued until Christianity was formally established as the religion of the Roman Empire. In the so-called Apostolical Constitutions, which were drawn up in the second or early in the third century, we find a provision that these private courts of arbitration should be held early in the week, that any disputes which might arise might be set right before the following Sunday. Such courts of arbitration have given place to the Christian courts of law, before which it often becomes necessary for a Christian to plead, lest violent or covetous men should dissolve the framework of society. Yet the principle of this passage should guide us still, of regarding mutual love as of more importance than ‘the things that pertain to this life,’ of preferring rather to suffer wrong than to appeal to the law, unless some more important matter is at stake than our individual loss or inconvenience.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and not before the saints</span>] Cf. St <a href="/matthew/18-17.htm" title="And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it to the church: but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be to you as an heathen man and a publican.">Matthew 18:17</a>, where we have a precept of Jesus Christ concerning the settlement of differences in the Christian Church.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/1_corinthians/6.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/1_corinthians/6-1.htm" title="Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints?">1 Corinthians 6:1</a>. <span class="greekheb">Τολμᾷ</span>, <span class="ital">dare</span>) Treason against Christians is denoted, by this high-sounding word.—<span class="greekheb">τὶς</span>, <span class="ital">any one</span>) even one single person.—<span class="greekheb">κρίνεσθαι</span>) in the middle voice, that is <span class="greekheb">κρίμα ἔχειν</span>, <span class="ital">obtain a judgment, go to law</span>, v. 7.—<span class="greekheb">ἀδίκων</span>, <span class="ital">before the unjust</span>) Every <span class="ital">unbeliever is unjust;</span> generally so, even as a citizen.—<span class="greekheb">ἐτὶ τῶν ἀγίων</span>, <span class="ital">before the saints</span>) Christians. The great privilege of believers was to settle even civil matters among themselves, and the magistrate ought not to interfere at all with private affairs, unless in the case of those who especially apply to him. The heathen magistrates were very indulgent to the Jews; and in this department no difference was hitherto made between the Jews and the Christians.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-11.</span> - <span class="accented">Litigation before heathen courts forbidden.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Dare any of you?</span> rather, <span class="accented">Dare any one of you?</span> It is in St. Paul's view an <span class="accented">audacious</span> defiance of Christian duties to seek from the heathen the justice due from brother to brother. <span class="cmt_word">A matter;</span> some ground of civil dispute. <span class="cmt_word">Against another;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> against another Christian.

How "unjust" the pagans were in the special sense of the word, the Christians of that day had daily opportunities of seeing; and in a more general sense, the Gentiles were "sinners" (<a href="/matthew/26-45.htm">Matthew 26:45</a>). Even the Jews were bound to settle their civil disputes before their own tribunals. The ideal Jew was <span class="accented">jashar</span>, or "the upright man," and Jews could not consistently seek integrity from those who were not upright. <span class="accented">A fortiori</span>, Christians ought not to do so. <span class="cmt_word">Before the saints.</span> All Christians were ideally "saints," just as the heathen were normally "unjust." If Christians went to law with one another before the heathen, they belied their profession of mutual love, caused scandal, and were almost necessarily tempted into compliance with heathen customs, even to the extent of recognizing idols. Our Lord had already laid down the rule that "brothers" ought to settle their quarrels among themselves (<a href="/matthew/18-15.htm">Matthew 18:15-17</a>). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/1_corinthians/6.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Dare<p>"The insulted majesty of Christians is denoted by a grand word" (Bengel). </body></html>
