In the abundance of spiritual gifts bestowed on the Corinthians, some abuses had crept in; but as Christ did the will, and sought the honour of God, so the Christian should avow his subjection to Christ, doing his will and seeking his glory. We should, even in our dress and habit, avoid every thing that may dishonour Christ. The woman was made subject to man, because made for his help and comfort. And she should do nothing, in Christian assemblies, which looked like a claim of being equal. She ought to have power, that is, a veil, on her head, because of the angels. Their presence should keep Christians from all that is wrong while in the worship of God. Nevertheless, the man and the woman were made for one another. They were to be mutual comforts and blessings, not one a slave, and the other a tyrant. God has so settled matters, both in the kingdom of providence and that of grace, that the authority and subjection of each party should be for mutual help and benefit. It was the common usage of the churches, for women to appear in public assemblies, and join in public worship, veiled; and it was right that they should do so. The Christian religion sanctions national customs wherever these are not against the great principles of truth and holiness; affected singularities receive no countenance from any thing in the Bible.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For the man is not of the woman - The man was not formed from the woman.<p>But the woman of the man - From his side; <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/2-18.htm">Genesis 2:18</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/2-22.htm">Genesis 2:22-23</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. is of &#8230; of&#8212;takes his being from ("out of") &#8230; from: referring to woman's original creation, "taken out of man" (compare Ge 2:23).

In the present state of things, and according to the ordinary course of generation and propagation of mankind, man is of the woman, though not without the means of man; he is conceived in her, bore by her, and born of her; but the apostle respects the original formation of man, as he was immediately made by God out of the dust of the earth, before the woman was in being, and so not of her: <p>but the woman of the man; she was made out of his rib, and took both her name and nature from him; God was the author, and man the matter of her being; her original under God, is owing to him; and therefore as he was first in being, he must be superior to her: this serves to prove all that has been as yet said; as that man is the head of the woman, the woman is the glory of man, what he may glory in as being from him; and therefore there should be this difference in their appearance at public worship. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_corinthians/11.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{7}</span> For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man.</span><p>(7) He proves the inequality of the woman by the fact that from the man is the substance of which woman was first made.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/1_corinthians/11.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/context/1_corinthians/11-8.htm" title="For the man is not of the woman: but the woman of the man....">1 Corinthians 11:8-9</a> add two more to the chain of <span class="ital">for’s</span> extending from <a href="/1_corinthians/11-6.htm" title="For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered.">1 Corinthians 11:6</a> : a double reason for asserting that woman is man’s glory appears in the revelation of the origin of mankind made by Scripture (<a href="/context/genesis/2-18.htm" title="And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him....">Genesis 2:18-25</a> : the <span class="ital">second</span> narrative of Creation, J of the critics), where Eve is represented as framed from a rib taken out of Adam’s body to be his “helpmate”.
