Now, that these ends may be effectually answered, this service must be performed by the whole members of each particular church, not in separate companies, but together, as making one harmonious society, by whose joint concurrence and communion in the service, the death of their Master is not only remembered, but declared in the most public manner to the world, as a fact known and believed by all Christians from the beginning.” <span class="ital">Saying, This cup is the new testament </span>— Or, <span class="ital">new covenant, </span>rather, as the word more properly signifies. That is, it is the solemn seal and memorial of the covenant which is established <span class="ital">in my blood, </span>by which all its invaluable blessings are procured for you. Our Lord did not mean that the covenant of grace was first made at the time he shed his blood. It was made immediately after the fall, on account of the merit of his obedience unto the death, which God then considered as accomplished, because it was certainly to be accomplished at the time determined. Now <span class="ital">this </span>likewise <span class="ital">do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me </span>— And in order to maintain the memory of my bleeding, dying love, in the church and in the world. The ancient sacrifices were offered in remembrance of <span class="ital">sin; </span>this sacrifice, once offered, is still represented in remembrance of the <span class="ital">remission of sin. </span>According to the Papists, the expression, <span class="ital">as oft as ye drink it, </span>“implies that the cup, in the Lord’s supper, may sometimes be omitted; and on that pretence they have denied the cup to the laity;” but how justly, may be known by taking notice that the words, <span class="ital">as often as, </span>are applied (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-26.htm" title="For as often as you eat this bread, and drink this cup, you do show the Lord's death till he come.">1 Corinthians 11:26</a>) to the bread as well as to the cup. Besides, Matthew hath told us, that when Christ gave the cup, he said, (<a href="/matthew/26-27.htm" title="And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink you all of it;">Matthew 26:27</a>,) <span class="ital">drink ye all of it; </span>which being both an invitation and a command, all Christians are as much entitled to the cup as to the bread.” <span class="ital">For as often as ye </span>— The church of God in any age; <span class="ital">eat this bread and drink this cup </span>— With proper solemnity and seriousness, faith, love, and gratitude; <span class="ital">ye do show forth the Lord’s death </span>— Ye proclaim, as it were, and openly avow it to God and all the world; so the word <span class="greekheb">καταγγελλετε</span>, here used, signifies: <span class="ital">till he come — </span>To close the present scene of things, and to receive all his faithful servants to a place where, for ever dwelling with him, they will no more need these memorials of an absent Saviour. Though at the institution of this ordinance our Lord spake nothing of his own second coming, yet in his discourse after the celebration of it, he connected his second coming with his death, <a href="/john/14-3.htm" title="And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you to myself; that where I am, there you may be also.">John 14:3</a>. The apostle therefore truly expressed his Master’s intention, when he told the Corinthians, that by publishing the Lord’s death, they published also his coming to judgment, and that the service of the supper was intended as a publication of both. <span class="ital">Wherefore </span>— <span class="greekheb">Ωστε</span>, <span class="ital">so that; whosoever shall eat this bread, &c., unworthily — </span>That is, in an unworthy, irreverent manner, without properly regarding him that appointed it, or the design of its appointment; <span class="ital">shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord </span>— That is, of profaning that which represents his body and blood.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:23-34 The apostle describes the sacred ordinance, of which he had the knowledge by revelation from Christ. As to the visible signs, these are the bread and wine. What is eaten is called bread, though at the same time it is said to be the body of the Lord, plainly showing that the apostle did not mean that the bread was changed into flesh. St. Matthew tells us, our Lord bid them all drink of the cup, ch. Mt 26:27, as if he would, by this expression, provide against any believer being deprived of the cup. The things signified by these outward signs, are Christ's body and blood, his body broken, his blood shed, together with all the benefits which flow from his death and sacrifice. Our Saviour's actions were, taking the bread and cup, giving thanks, breaking the bread, and giving both the one and the other. The actions of the communicants were, to take the bread and eat, to take the cup and drink, and to do both in remembrance of Christ. But the outward acts are not the whole, or the principal part, of what is to be done at this holy ordinance. Those who partake of it, are to take him as their Lord and Life, yield themselves up to him, and live upon him. Here is an account of the ends of this ordinance. It is to be done in remembrance of Christ, to keep fresh in our minds his dying for us, as well as to remember Christ pleading for us, in virtue of his death, at God's right hand. It is not merely in remembrance of Christ, of what he has done and suffered; but to celebrate his grace in our redemption. We declare his death to be our life, the spring of all our comforts and hopes. And we glory in such a declaration; we show forth his death, and plead it as our accepted sacrifice and ransom. The Lord's supper is not an ordinance to be observed merely for a time, but to be continued. The apostle lays before the Corinthians the danger of receiving it with an unsuitable temper of mind; or keeping up the covenant with sin and death, while professing to renew and confirm the covenant with God. No doubt such incur great guilt, and so render themselves liable to spiritual judgements. But fearful believers should not be discouraged from attending at this holy ordinance. The Holy Spirit never caused this scripture to be written to deter serious Christians from their duty, though the devil has often made this use of it. The apostle was addressing Christians, and warning them to beware of the temporal judgements with which God chastised his offending servants. And in the midst of judgement, God remembers mercy: he many times punishes those whom he loves. It is better to bear trouble in this world, than to be miserable for ever. The apostle points our the duty of those who come to the Lord's table. Self-examination is necessary to right attendance at this holy ordinance. If we would thoroughly search ourselves, to condemn and set right what we find wrong, we should stop Divine judgements. The apostle closes all with a caution against the irregularities of which the Corinthians were guilty at the Lord's table. Let all look to it, that they do not come together to God's worship, so as to provoke him, and bring down vengeance on themselves.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>After the same manner - In like manner; likewise. With the same circumstances, and ceremonies, and designs. The purpose was the same.<p>When he had supped - That is, all this occurred after the observance of the usual paschal supper. It could not, therefore, be a part of it, nor could it have been designed to be a festival or feast merely. The apostle introduces this evidently in order to show them that it could not be, as they seemed to have supposed, an occasion of feasting. It was after the supper, and was therefore to be observed in a distinct manner.<p>Saying, This cup ... - See the note at <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/26-27.htm">Matthew 26:27-28</a>.<p>Is the New Testament - The new covenant which God is about to establish with people. The word "testament" with us properly denotes a "will" - an instrument by which a man disposes of his property after his death. This is also the proper classic meaning of the Greek word used here, &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;  (diathe&#772;ke&#772;). But this is evidently not the sense in which the word is designed to be used in the New Testament. The idea of a "will" or "testament," strictly so called, is not that which the sacred writers intend to convey by the word. The idea is evidently that of a compact, agreement, covenant, to which there is so frequent reference in the Old Testament, and which is expressed by the word &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514;  ber&#305;&#770;yth (Berith), a compact, a covenant, Of that word the proper translation in Greek would have been &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;  sunthe&#772;ke&#772; a covenant, agreement. But it is remarkable that that word never is used by the Septuagint to denote the covenant made between God and man.<p>That translation uniformly employs for this purpose the word &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;  diathe&#772;ke&#772;, a will, or a testament, as a translation of the Hebrew word, where there is a reference to the covenant which God is represented as making with people. The word &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;  sunthe&#772;ke&#772; is used by them but three times <a href="/isaiah/28-15.htm">Isaiah 28:15</a>; <a href="/isaiah/30-1.htm">Isaiah 30:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/11-6.htm">Daniel 11:6</a>, and in neither instance with any reference to the covenant which God is represented as making with man. The word &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;  diathe&#772;ke&#772;, as the translation of &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514;  ber&#305;&#770;yth (Berith), occurs more than two hundred times. (See Trommius' Concord.) Now this must have evidently been of design. What the reason was which induced them to adopt this can only be conjectured. It may have been that as the translation was to be seen by the Gentiles as well as by the Jews (if it were not expressly made, as has been affirmed by Josephus and others, for the use of Ptolemy), they were unwilling to represent the eternal and infinite Yahweh as entering into a "compact, an agreement" with his creature man. They, therefore, adopted a word which would represent him as expressing "his will" to them in a book of revelation. The version by the Septuagint was evidently in use by the apostles, and by the Jews everywhere. The writers of the New Testament, therefore, adopted the word as they found it; and spoke of the new dispensation as a new "testament" which God made with man. The meaning is, that this was the new compact or covenant which God was to make with man in contradistinction from that made through Moses.<p>In my blood - Through my blood; that is, this new compact is to be sealed with my blood, in illusion to the ancient custom of sealing an agreement by a sacrifice; see the note at <a href="/matthew/26-28.htm">Matthew 26:28</a>.<p>This do ye - Partake of this bread and wine; that is, celebrate this ordinance.<p>As oft as ye drink it - Not prescribing any time; and not even specifying the frequency with which it was to be done; but leaving it to themselves to determine how often they would partake of it. The time of the Passover had been fixed by positive statute; the more mild and gentle system of Christianity left it to the followers of the Redeemer themselves to determine how often they would celebrate his death. It was commanded them to do it; it was presumed that their love to him would be so strong as to secure a frequent observance; it was permitted to them, as in prayer, to celebrate it on any occasion of affliction, trial, or deep interest when they would feel their need of it, and when they would suppose that its observance would be for the edification of the Church.<p>In remembrance of me - This expresses the whole design of the ordinance. It is a simple memorial, or remembrancer; designed to recall in a striking and impressive manner the memory of the Redeemer. It does this by a tender appeal to the senses - by the exhibition of the broken bread, and by the wine. The Saviour knew how prone people would be to forget him, and he, therefore, appointed this ordinance as a means by which his memory should be kept up in the world. The ordinance is rightly observed when it recalls the memory of the Saviour; and when its observance is the means of producing a deep, and lively, and vivid impression on the mind, of his death for sin. This expression, at the institution of the supper, is used by Luke Luk 22:19; though it does not occur in Matthew, Mark, or John. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>25. when he had supped&#8212;Greek, "after the eating of supper," namely, the Passover supper which preceded the Lord's Supper, as the love-feast did subsequently. Therefore, you Corinthians ought to separate common meals from the Lord's Supper [Bengel].<p>the new testament&#8212;or "covenant."

Paul twice records it (1Co 11:24 and here) as suiting his purpose. The old sacrifices brought sins continually to remembrance (Heb 10:1, 3). The Lord's Supper brings to remembrance Christ and His sacrifice once for all for the full and final remission of sins.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_corinthians/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="/1_corinthians/11-24.htm" title="And when he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.">1 Corinthians 11:24</a>"</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_corinthians/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>After the same manner also he took the cup,....

Hofmann is wrong in thinking that Paul lays such special emphasis on this statement of the purpose of the Supper, because it appeared incompatible with the Corinthian mode of observing it. The apostle has no intention whatever here of laying emphasis either on one thing or another; he wishes only to <span class="ital">report</span>, in their simple <span class="ital">objectivity</span>, the sacred words in which the original institution was couched.

See Homer, "Iliad," ii., 124; 3. 73, 93. So the Latin foedus ferire "to kill a league," whence our phrase to strike a compact.

In Philo it has the same sense as in the Septuagint, and covenant is its invariable sense in the New Testament. </body></html>
