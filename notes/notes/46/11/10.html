What is meant, first, by the woman having “power on her head?”<p>1. There have been many—some of them most fanciful—suggestions that the word for power (<span class= "ital">exousia</span>) may have crept in instead of some other word by the mistake of some copyist; or that the word used by St. Paul may have been <span class= "ital">exiousa</span>—“When she goes out in public;” or two words (<span class= "ital">ex ousias</span>)—“in accordance with her nature.” All explanations, however, which require an alteration in the Greek text of the passage must be set aside, for (1) there is no MS. evidence whatever to support any other reading than the ordinary one, <span class= "ital">exousian;</span> and (2) any alteration of a difficult or unusual word would have been naturally into a word that would simplify the passage—whereas here, if alteration has taken place, it has been to insert a word which has increased the obscurity of a difficult passage.<p>2. It has been maintained that the word <span class= "ital">exousia</span> here means the sign of power, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> a veil, which is the symbol of the husband’s power over the wife. The fatal objection to this view, however, is that <span class= "ital">exousia</span> expresses our own power, and not the power exercised by another over us. It is a word frequently used by St. Paul in this sense. (See <a href="/1_corinthians/8-9.htm" title="But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumbling block to them that are weak.">1Corinthians 8:9</a>; <a href="/context/1_corinthians/9-4.htm" title="Have we not power to eat and to drink?">1Corinthians 9:4-5</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/9-12.htm" title="If others be partakers of this power over you, are not we rather? Nevertheless we have not used this power; but suffer all things, lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ.">1Corinthians 9:12</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/9-18.htm" title="What is my reward then? Truly that, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel of Christ without charge, that I abuse not my power in the gospel.">1Corinthians 9:18</a>.) Whatever interpretation, therefore, we put upon this passage, it must be consistent with this word being interpreted as meaning some “power” which the woman herself has, and not some power exercised over her by her husband.<p>Most commentators have quoted a passage from Diodorus Sic. i. 47, in which the Greek word “kingdom” (<span class= "ital">basileia</span>) is used to signify “crown,” as an illustration of the use of the word indicating the thing symbolised for the symbol itself. The parallelism between that use of the word kingdom, and the use here of the word “power,” has been very positively denied (Stanley and others), on the ground that the “use of the name of the thing signified for the symbol, though natural when the power spoken of belongs to the person, would be unnatural when applied to the power exercised over that person by some one else.” But the parallelism will hold good if we can refer the “power” here to some symbol of a power which belongs to the woman herself.<p>If we bear in mind the Apostle’s constant use of words with a double significance, or rather with both an obvious and a subtly implied meaning, and if we also recall the reference made to a woman’s abundance of hair in <a href="/context/1_corinthians/11-5.htm" title="But every woman that prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head: for that is even all one as if she were shaven.">1Corinthians 11:5-6</a>, and the further reference to a woman’s long hair in <a href="/context/1_corinthians/11-14.htm" title="Does not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame to him?">1Corinthians 11:14-15</a>, where the hair of the woman, given her by nature, and the wearing of a veil are used as almost identical thoughts, we may, I think, conclude that the “power” here spoken of is that long hair which is called in <a href="/1_corinthians/11-15.htm" title="But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering.">1Corinthians 11:15</a> her “glory.” It is remarkable that Callistratus twice uses this word <span class= "ital">exousia</span> in connection with hair to express its abundance. To the Jews the recollection of Samson’s history would have given the word “power,” when applied to hair, a remarkable significance. To thus turn aside abruptly in the middle of a long passage in which woman’s subordination is enforced, and speak suddenly and vividly of her “power,” would be eminently Pauline. In the Apostle’s writings the thought of inferiority and superiority, of ruler and server, are frequently and almost paradoxically regarded and enforced as identical. To serve because you rule; to be weak because you are in another sense strong, are thoughts strikingly combined again and again in the Epistles of St. Paul. Thus I would imagine him here to suddenly turn aside and say, I have been speaking of your bondage and subordination, you are, because of this, to have a covering (a veil or long hair) on your head as a sign, and yet that very thing which is the symbol of your subjection to man is the sign of your beauty and “power” as a woman.<p><span class= "bld">Because of the angels.</span>—Why should a woman have her head covered (either with her natural veil of hair, or with an artificial veil shrouding her face) because of the angels? The same objections which have been already stated to any alteration of the usual Greek text of the earlier clause of this verse apply equally here. The MS. evidence is unanimous in favour of the word “angels,” nor can we accept any of the figurative meanings attached to the word angel as “the president” (see <a href="/revelation/2-1.htm" title="To the angel of the church of Ephesus write; These things said he that holds the seven stars in his right hand, who walks in the middle of the seven golden candlesticks;">Revelation 2:1</a>), or “messenger,” sent by enemies to see what took place contrary to general custom in those assemblies. We must take the word “angel” in its ordinary and general sense.<p>That the angels were present in assemblies for worship was an idea prevalent among the Jews (<a href="/psalms/138-1.htm" title="I will praise you with my whole heart: before the gods will I sing praise to you.">Psalm 138:1</a>, in the LXX.), and regarded as they were by the Christian as “ministering spirits” (<a href="/hebrews/1-14.htm" title="Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?">Hebrews 1:14</a>), no doubt their presence would be realised in the meetings of Christians.<p>We have already seen that the Apostle in his argument upon the relation of the sexes to each other (<a href="/context/1_corinthians/11-7.htm" title="For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, for as much as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.">1Corinthians 11:7-9</a>), refers to the first three chapters of Genesis as illustrating and enforcing that relationship. What more natural than that his thoughts should have gone on to 1 Corinthians 6 of the same book, where is the record of the angels (in the LXX. the word translated “sons of God” is “the angels”—<span class= "ital">angeloi</span>) having been enamoured by the beauty of women, and so having fallen from their high estate. This account of “the fall of the angels” is referred to more than once elsewhere in the New Testament (see Jude <a href="/1_corinthians/11-1.htm" title="Be you followers of me, even as I also am of Christ.">1Corinthians 11:1</a>; <a href="/2_peter/2-4.htm" title="For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved to judgment;">2Peter 2:4</a>), and through Rabbinical interpretations would have been familiar to St. Paul’s converts. Without at all necessarily expressing his belief in the historic accuracy of this legendary view of the fall of the angels, St. Paul might use it as an argument with those who did believe it (as in the case of the Rock. see <a href="/1_corinthians/10-4.htm" title="And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.">1Corinthians 10:4</a>, and Note there). You believe—would be St. Paul’s appeal to these women—that once, through seeing the beauty of the daughters of men, the holy angels themselves fell—even that thought ought to make you feel that it is not seemly for you to be without a veil (of which your “power on your head,” <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> your hair, is the type) in those assemblies where the angels are present as God’s ministering spirits.<p>It has been urged (by Meyer and others) that the word “angels,” in the New Testament, always signifies <span class= "ital">good angels,</span> and it is in that sense I would regard it here, for the thought surely is, that they are good angels, and should not, therefore, be tempted. I presume the idea was also that the fallen angels were “good” before their fall.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_corinthians/11.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/1_corinthians/11-10.htm" title="For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels.">1 Corinthians 11:10</a></span>. <span class="ital">For this cause </span>— As well as for the other reasons above mentioned; <span class="ital">the woman ought to have power on her head </span>— That is, a veil, as a token of her being under the power and subjection of the man: and so much the rather should she wear it in worshipping assemblies; <span class="ital">because of the angels — </span>Who are present there, and before whom all should be careful not to do any thing indecent or irregular. “Though there is no example, either in sacred or profane writers, of the word <span class="greekheb">εξουσια</span>, here rendered <span class="ital">power, </span>being used to denote <span class="ital">a veil; </span>yet all agree that it can have no other meaning in this passage.” Whitby understands the latter clause of evil angels, paraphrasing and commenting on the words thus: “She, being tempted by the prince of evil angels to that which is a perpetual cause of shame to her, and which increased her subjection to the man, (<a href="/genesis/3-16.htm" title="To the woman he said, I will greatly multiply your sorrow and your conception; in sorrow you shall bring forth children; and your desire shall be to your husband, and he shall rule over you.">Genesis 3:16</a>,) ought therefore to use this token of shame-facedness and subjection.” She is to have her head covered, say the Jews, “like one that mourneth, as a token of shame. Hence Philo calls the <span class="greekheb">το επικρανον</span>, <span class="ital">cover of the woman’s head, the symbol of her shame; </span>and this shame, say they, is due to her, <span class="ital">because she first brought sin into the world. </span>It is with her as when one transgresseth and is ashamed; and therefore she comes forth with her head covered. She ought, saith Tertullian, by her habit to resemble Eve, a mourner and a penitent; ob ignominiam primi delicti,” for the shame of the first sin. See on <a href="/context/1_timothy/2-11.htm" title="Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection....">1 Timothy 2:11-14</a>. The former interpretation, however, which supposes that good angels are meant, who, being ministering spirits to the heirs of salvation, might be present in the religious assemblies of the Christians, seems much more probably to be the true one.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:2-16 Here begin particulars respecting the public assemblies, ch. 1Co 14. In the abundance of spiritual gifts bestowed on the Corinthians, some abuses had crept in; but as Christ did the will, and sought the honour of God, so the Christian should avow his subjection to Christ, doing his will and seeking his glory. We should, even in our dress and habit, avoid every thing that may dishonour Christ. The woman was made subject to man, because made for his help and comfort. And she should do nothing, in Christian assemblies, which looked like a claim of being equal. She ought to have power, that is, a veil, on her head, because of the angels. Their presence should keep Christians from all that is wrong while in the worship of God. Nevertheless, the man and the woman were made for one another. They were to be mutual comforts and blessings, not one a slave, and the other a tyrant. God has so settled matters, both in the kingdom of providence and that of grace, that the authority and subjection of each party should be for mutual help and benefit. It was the common usage of the churches, for women to appear in public assemblies, and join in public worship, veiled; and it was right that they should do so. The Christian religion sanctions national customs wherever these are not against the great principles of truth and holiness; affected singularities receive no countenance from any thing in the Bible.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For this cause ... - There is scarcely any passage in the Scriptures which has more exercised the ingenuity of commentators than this verse. The various attempts which have been made to explain it may be seen in Pool, Rosenmuller, Bloomfield, etc. After all the explanations which have been given of it, I confess, I do not understand it. It is not difficult to see what the connection requires us to suppose in the explanation. The obvious interpretation would be, that a woman should have a veil on her head because of the angels who were supposed to be present, observing them in their public worship; and it is generally agreed that the word "power" (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;  exousian) denotes a veil, or a covering for the head. But the word power does not occur in this sense in any classic writer. Bretschneider understands it of a veil, as being a defense or guard to the face, lest it should be seen by others. Some have supposed that it was the name of a female ornament that was worn on the head, formed of braids of hair set with jewels. Most commentators agree that it means a "veil," though some think (see Bloomfield) that it is called power to denote the veil which was worn by married women, which indicated the superiority of the married woman to the maiden. But it is sufficient to say in reply to this, that the apostle is not referring to married women in contradistinction from those who are unmarried, but is showing that all women who prophecy or pray in public should be veiled. There can, perhaps, be no doubt that the word "power" has reference to a veil, or to a covering for the head; but why it is called power I confess I do not understand; and most of the comments on the word are, in my view, egregious trifling.<p>Because of the angels - Some have explained this of good angels, who were supposed to be present in their assemblies (see Doddridge); others refer it to evil angels; and others to messengers or spies who, it has been supposed, were present in their public assemblies, and who would report greatly to the disadvantage of the Christian assemblies if the women were seen to be unveiled. I do not know what it means; and I regard it as one of the very few pass ages in the Bible whose meaning as yet is wholly inexplicable. The most natural interpretation seems to me to be this: "A woman in the public assemblies, and in speaking in the presence of people, should wear a veil - the usual symbol of modesty and subordination - because the angels of God are witnesses of your public worship <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/1-13.htm">Hebrews 1:13</a>, and because they know and appreciate the propriety of subordination and order in public assemblies."<p>According to this, it would mean that the simple reason would be that the angels were witnesses of their worship; and that they were the friends of propriety, due subordination, and order; and that they ought to observe these in all assemblies convened for the worship of God - I do not know that this sense has been proposed by any commentator; but it is one which strikes me as the most obvious and natural, and consistent with the context. The following remarks respecting the ladies of Persia may throw some light on this subject - "The head-dress of the women is simple; their hair is drawn behind the head, and divided into several tresses; the beauty of this head-dress consists in the thickness and length of these tresses, which should fall even down to the heels, in default of which, they lengthen them with tresses of silk. The ends of these tresses they decorate with pearls and jewels, or ornaments of gold or silver. The head is covered, "under" the veil or kerchief "(course chef)," only by the end of a small "bandeau," shaped into a triangle; this "bandeau," which is of various colors, is thin and light.<p>The "bandalette" is embroidered by the needle, or covered with jewelry, according to the quality of the wearer. This is, in, my opinion, the ancient "tiara," or "diadem," of the queens of Persia. Only married women wear it; and it is the mark by which it is known that they are under subjection "(oc'est la la marque a laquelle on reconnoit qu' elles sont sous puissance o - power)." The girls have little "caps," instead of this kerchief or tiara; they wear no veil at home, but let two tresses of their hair fall under their cheeks. The caps of girls of superior rank are tied with a row of pearls. Girls are not shut up in Persia till they attain the age of six or seven years; before that age they go out of the seraglio, sometimes with their father, so that they may then be seen. I have seen some wonderfully pretty girls. They show the neck and bosom; and more beautiful cannot be seen" - Chardin. "The wearing of a veil by a married woman was a token of her being under power. The Hebrew name of the veil signifies dependence. Great importance was attached to this part of the dress in the East. All the women of Persia are pleasantly apparelled. When they are abroad in the streets, all, both rich and poor, are covered with a great veil, or sheet of very fine white cloth, of which one half, like a forehead cloth, comes down to the eyes, and, going over the head, reaches down to the heels; and the other half muffles up the face below the eyes, and being fastened with a pin to the left side of the head, falls down to their very shoes, even covering their hands, with which they hold that cloth by the two sides, so that, except the eyes, they are covered all over with it. Within doors they have their faces and breasts uncovered; but the Armenian women in their houses have always one half of their faces covered with a cloth, that goes athwart their noses, and hangs over their chin and breasts, except the maids of that nation, who, within doors, cover only the chin until they are married" - Thevenot. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. power on her head&#8212;the kerchief: French couvre chef, head-covering, the emblem of "power on her head"; the sign of her being under man's power, and exercising delegated authority under him. Paul had before his mind the root-connection between the Hebrew terms for "veil" (radid), and "subjection" (radad).<p>because of the angels&#8212;who are present at our Christian assemblies (compare Ps 138:1, "gods," that is, angels), and delight in the orderly subordination of the several ranks of God's worshippers in their respective places, the outward demeanor and dress of the latter being indicative of that inward humility which angels know to be most pleasing to their common Lord (1Co 4:9; Eph 3:10; Ec 5:6). Hammond quotes Chrysostom, "Thou standest with angels; thou singest with them; thou hymnest with them; and yet dost thou stand laughing?" Bengel explains, "As the angels are in relation to God, so the woman is in relation to man. God's face is uncovered; angels in His presence are veiled (Isa 6:2). Man's face is uncovered; woman in His presence is to be veiled. For her not to be so, would, by its indecorousness, offend the angels (Mt 18:10, 31). She, by her weakness, especially needs their ministry; she ought, therefore, to be the more careful not to offend them."<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_corinthians/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> By <span class="bld">power on her head</span> is here to be understood (as some think) a covering on her head, in sign that she is under the power of her husband: the thing signified is here put for the sign, as the sign is often put for the thing signified.

The generality of interpreters, by power, understand the veil, or covering on the woman's head, as a sign of the man's power over her, and her subjection to him; which Dr. Hammond endeavours to confirm, by observing that the Hebrew word  which signifies a woman's veil, or hood, comes from a root which signifies power and dominion; but in that he is mistaken, for the word is derived not from  to rule, govern, or exercise power and authority, but from   to expand, stretch out, or draw over, as a woman's veil is drawn over her head and face. The Greek word more properly signifies the power she had of putting on and off her covering as she pleased, according as times, places, and persons; made it necessary: <p>because of the angels; various are the senses given of these words, some taking them in a proper, others in a figurative sense: some in a proper sense of angels, and these either good or bad. Tertullian (e) understands them of evil angels, and that a woman should cover her head in time of worship, lest they should lust after her; though much rather the reason should be, lest they should irritate and provoke lust in others: but it is better to understand them of good angels, who attend the assemblies of the saints, and observe the air and behaviour of the worshippers; wherefore women should cover their heads with respect to them, and not give offence to those pure spirits, by an indecent appearance: it is agreeable to the notions of the Jews, that angels attend public prayers, and at the expounding of the word; they often speak (f) of an angel,    "that is appointed over prayers"; hence (g) Tertullian seems to have took his notion of an angel of prayer: and of angels being present at expounding of the Scriptures, take the following story (h); <p>"it happened to Rabban Jochanan ben Zaccai, that he was riding upon an ass, and as he was journeying, R. Eleazar ben Arach was leading an ass after him; he said to him, Rabbi, teach me one chapter in the work of Mercavah (Ezekiel's vision); he replied to him, not so have I taught you, nor in the Mercavah a single man, unless he was a wise man by his own industry; he answered him, Rabbi, give me leave to say one thing before thee, which thou hast taught me; immediately Rabban Jochanan ben Zaccai alighted from his ass and "veiled himself", and sat upon a stone under an olive tree; he said to him, Rabbi, why dost thou alight off from the ass? he replied, is it possible that thou shouldst expound in the work of Mercavah, and the Shekinah be with us,    , "and the ministering angels join us", and I ride upon an ass?'' <p>And a little after, <p>"R. Joshua and R. Jose the priest were walking on the road, they said, yea, let us expound in the work of Mercavah; R. Joshua opened and expounded, and that day was the solstice of Tammuz, and the heavens were thickened with clouds, and there appeared the form of a bow in the cloud, "and the ministering angels gathered together", , "and came to hear": as the children of men gather together, and come to see the rejoicings of the bridegroom and bride.'' <p>Moreover, this veiling of the woman in public worship because of angels, may be an imitation of the good angels, who when they sung the praises of God, and adored and glorified his perfections, covered their faces and their feet with their wings, <a href="/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1</a>. Many understanding these words in a figurative sense, and in this also they are not agreed; some by angels think young men are meant, who, for their gracefulness and comeliness, are compared to angels; others good men in general, that attend religious worship; others ministers of the word, called angels often in the book of the Revelations; which last seems to be most agreeable of any of these senses; and the women were to cover their heads, that they might not offend either of these, or stir up any impure desires in them; see <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:6</a> but as these words follow the account given of the creation of the woman from the man, and for his sake; this may have no reference to her conduct in public worship, but to the power she had of using her covering, or taking it off, or putting it on, at the time of her espousals to a man; which was sometimes done by proxy, or messengers, whom the Jews call  "angels" (i); their canon is, <p>"a man may espouse (a wife) by himself,  "or by his angel", or messenger; and a woman may be espoused by herself, or by her angel, or messenger:'' <p>wherefore because of these angels, or messengers, that came to espouse her to such, she had power over her head to take off her veil, and show herself, if she thought fit; or to keep it on, as expressing her modesty; or just as she pleased, when she by them was espoused to a man, for whose sake she was made; which sense, after Dr. Lightfoot, many learned men have given into, and seems probable. <p>(e) De Veland.

Sic. i. 47, in the phrase <span class="greekheb">ἔχουσαν τρεῖς βασιλείας ἐπὶ τῆς κεφ</span>., the <span class="ital">context</span> shows beyond a doubt that <span class="greekheb">βασ</span>. means symbols of <span class="ital">one’s own</span> power (diadems), so here the <span class="ital">connection</span> justifies the use of <span class="greekheb">ἐξουσία</span> to denote the sign of <span class="ital">another’s</span> power; the phrase thus simply having its proper reference brought out, and by no means being twisted into an opposite meaning, as Hofmann objects. Comp also the ornaments of the Egyptian priests, which, as being symbols of truth, bore the name of <span class="greekheb">ἀλήθεια</span>, Diod. Sic. i. 48. 77; Ael. <span class="ital">V. H.</span> xiv. 34. Schleusner explains <span class="greekheb">ἐξουσ</span>. as a <span class="ital">token of the honour</span> (of the married women over the single). But both the context (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-9.htm" title="Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man.">1 Corinthians 11:9</a>) and the literal meaning of <span class="greekheb">ἐξουσία</span> are against this. Bengel and Schrader make it a sign of <span class="ital">authority</span> to speak in public. But the whole connection points to the authority of the husband over the wife. There is not a word in the whole passage about the <span class="ital">potestas orandi</span>, etc., nor of its being granted by the <span class="ital">husband</span> (Schrader). Hagenbach’s view (<span class="ital">Stud. u. Krit.</span> 1828, p. 401) is also contrary to the context, seeing that we have previously <span class="greekheb">διὰ τὸν ἄνδρα</span>; he understands <span class="greekheb">ἐξουσία</span> as a <span class="ital">mark of descent</span>. Paul, he holds, formed the word upon the analogy of <span class="greekheb">παρουσία κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>[1779],—a view that does not even leave to the term its lexical meaning, which was surely familiar enough to the apostle and his readers. Other expositors make <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΞΟΥΣΊΑ</span></span></span> <span class="ital">directly</span> to signify a <span class="ital">veil</span> (Michaelis, Schulz), to establish which they have appealed in the most arbitrary way to the help of Hebrew words (Cappellus, Clericus, Hammond, Semler, Ernesti). Hitzig again, in the <span class="ital">theol. Jahrb.</span> 1854, p. 129 ff., gives out the term to be a <span class="ital">Jewish-Greek</span> one, derived from <span class="greekheb">ἐξ ἴσου</span>; because the veil had, he maintains, two overhanging halves which balanced each other in front and behind. But what is fatal to every attempt of this kind is that <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΞΟΥΣΊΑ</span></span></span>, <span class="ital">power</span>, is so very <span class="ital">familiar</span> a word, and suits perfectly well here in this its ordinary sense, while, as the name of a veil, it would be entirely without trace and without analogy in Greek. As for the derivation from <span class="greekheb">ἐξ ἴσου</span>, that is simply an etymological impossibility. Other interpreters still assume that <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΞΟΥΣ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> means here not a <span class="ital">sign</span> of power, but <span class="ital">power itself</span>. So, in various preposterous ways, earlier commentators cited by Wolf; and so more recently Kypke and Pott. The former puts a comma after <span class="greekheb">ἐξουσία</span>, and explains the clause: “propterea mulier potestati obnoxia est, ita ut velamen (comp <a href="/1_corinthians/11-4.htm" title="Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonors his head.">1 Corinthians 11:4</a>) in capite habeat.” But the sense of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὈΦΕΊΛΕΙΝ ΤΙ</span></span></span> would rather have required <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὙΠΑΚΟΉΝ</span></span></span> in place of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΞΟΥΣΊΑΝ</span></span></span>. Pott again (in the <span class="ital">Götting. Weihnachtsprogr.</span> 1831, p. 22 ff.) renders it: “mulierem oportet servare jus seu potestatem in caput suum, sc[1781] eo, quod illud velo obtegat.” Not inconsistent with linguistic usage (<a href="/revelation/11-6.htm" title="These have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the days of their prophecy: and have power over waters to turn them to blood, and to smite the earth with all plagues, as often as they will.">Revelation 11:6</a>; <a href="/revelation/20-6.htm" title="Blessed and holy is he that has part in the first resurrection: on such the second death has no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.">Revelation 20:6</a>; <a href="/revelation/14-18.htm" title="And another angel came out from the altar, which had power over fire; and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle, saying, Thrust in your sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe.">Revelation 14:18</a>; comp <a href="/luke/19-17.htm" title="And he said to him, Well, you good servant: because you have been faithful in a very little, have you authority over ten cities.">Luke 19:17</a>), but all the more so with the context, since what <a href="/1_corinthians/11-9.htm" title="Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man.">1 Corinthians 11:9</a> states is just that the woman has <span class="ital">no</span> power at all over herself, and <span class="ital">for that very reason</span> ought to wear a veil. Hofmann, too, rejects the symbolical explanation of <span class="greekheb">ἐξουσία</span>, and finds the metaphorical element simply in the local import of the phrase <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΠῚ ΚΕΦΑΛῆς</span></span></span> (comparing it with such passages as <a href="/acts/18-6.htm" title="And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook his raiment, and said to them, Your blood be on your own heads; I am clean; from now on I will go to the Gentiles.">Acts 18:6</a>, where, however, the idea is wholly different in kind). He makes the thought to be: the woman must have a power upon or over her head, because she must be subject to such a power. In that case what would be meant would be her husband’s power, which she must have over her. But the question in hand was not at all about anything so general and self-evident as that, but about the <span class="ital">veiling</span>, which she was bound to observe. The <span class="ital">conjectural</span> interpretations which have been attempted are so far-fetched as not to deserve further mention. We may add that there is no evidence in antiquity for the <span class="ital">symbolism</span> which Paul here connects with the veiling of the women in assemblies (the hints which Baur founds upon in the <span class="ital">theol. Jahrb.</span> 1852, p. 571 ff., are too remote). We have the more reason, therefore, to agree with Lücke in ascribing it to the ingenious apostle himself, however old the custom itself—that married women should wear veils in public—was in Hebrew usage (Ewald, <span class="ital">Alterth.</span> p. 269 f.).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">διὰ τοὺς ἀγγέλους</span>] which Baur uncritically holds to be a gloss—a view to which Neander also was inclined—is not a <span class="ital">formula obsecrandi</span> (Heydenreich, who, with Vorstius, Hammond, Bengel, and Zachariae, strangely assumes a reference to <a href="/isaiah/6-2.htm" title="Above it stood the seraphim: each one had six wings; with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he did fly.">Isaiah 6:2</a>), but a clause adding to the <span class="ital">inner</span> ground (<span class="greekheb">διὰ τοῦτο</span>) an <span class="ital">outward</span> one: “for the sake of the angels,” <span class="ital">in order to avoid exciting disapproval among them</span>. <span class="greekheb">Τοὺς ἀγγέλους αἰδέσθητι</span>, Chrysostom. Erasmus puts it well in his <span class="ital">Paraphrase</span>: “Quodsi mulier eo venit impudentiae, ut testes hominum oculos non vereatur, saltem ob angelos testes, qui vestris conventibus intersunt, caput operiat.” That the holy angels are present at assemblies for worship, is an idea which Paul had retained from <span class="ital">Judaism</span> (LXX. <a href="/psalms/138-1.htm" title="I will praise you with my whole heart: before the gods will I sing praise to you.">Psalm 138:1</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/tobit/12-12.htm" title="Now therefore, when thou didst pray, and Sara thy daughter in law, I did bring the remembrance of your prayers before the Holy One: and when thou didst bury the dead, I was with thee likewise.">Tob 12:12</a> f.; Buxtorf, <span class="ital">Synag.</span> 15, p. 306; Grotius <span class="ital">in loc</span>[1783]; Eisenmenger, <span class="ital">entdeckt. Judenth</span>. II. p. 393), and made an element in his <span class="ital">Christian</span> conception,[1784] in accordance with the ministering destination ascribed to them in <a href="/hebrews/1-14.htm" title="Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?">Hebrews 1:14</a>, but without any of the Jewish elaborations. It must remain a very doubtful point whether he had <span class="ital">guardian angels</span> (<a href="/acts/12-15.htm" title="And they said to her, You are mad. But she constantly affirmed that it was even so. Then said they, It is his angel.">Acts 12:15</a>; <a href="/matthew/18-10.htm" title="Take heed that you despise not one of these little ones; for I say to you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven.">Matthew 18:10</a>) specially in view (Jerome, August. <span class="ital">de Trin.</span> xii. 7; Theodoret, comp Theophylact), seeing that he nowhere says anything definite about them. Other expositors make the reference to be to the <span class="ital">bad</span> angels, who would be incited to wantonness by the unveiled women (Tert. <span class="ital">c. Marc.</span> v. 8; <span class="ital">de virg. vel.</span> 7, <span class="ital">al</span>[1786]),[1787] or might incite the men to it (Schoettgen, Zeltner, Mosheim), or might do harm to the uncovered women (Wetstein, Semler). Others, again, understand it to mean <span class="ital">pious men</span> (Clem. Alex.), or the Christian <span class="ital">prophets</span> (Beza), or <span class="ital">those presiding in the congregation</span> (Ambrosiaster), or <span class="ital">those deputed to bring about betrothals</span> (Lightfoot), or unfriendly <span class="ital">spies</span> (Heumann, Alethius, Schulz, Morus, Storr, Stolz, Rosenmüller, Flatt, Schrader)—all mere attempts at explanation, which are sufficiently disposed of by the single fact that <span class="greekheb">ἄγγελοι</span>, when standing <span class="ital">absolutely</span> in the N. T., <span class="ital">always</span> denotes <span class="ital">good angels</span> alone. See on <a href="/1_corinthians/4-9.htm" title="For I think that God has set forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle to the world, and to angels, and to men.">1 Corinthians 4:9</a>. The correct exposition is given also by Düsterdieck, <span class="ital">l.c</span>[1788], who shows well the fine trait of apostolic mysticism in <span class="greekheb">διὰ τοὺς ἀγγέλους</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1775] Luther’s gloss is: “That is the veil or covering, by which one may see that she is under her husband’s authority, <a href="/genesis/3-16.htm" title="To the woman he said, I will greatly multiply your sorrow and your conception; in sorrow you shall bring forth children; and your desire shall be to your husband, and he shall rule over you.">Genesis 3:16</a>.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1776] <span class="greekheb">Ἄρκ τὸ καλύπτεσθαι ὑποταγῆς καὶ ἐξουσίας</span>.

Any allusion to <a href="/context/genesis/6-1.htm" title="And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born to them,...">Genesis 6:1-4</a> (suggested already by Tertullian, <span class="ital">al.</span> comp. also Kurtz, <span class="ital">d. Ehen d. Söhne Gottes</span>, p. 177, and Hofmann) is wholly foreign to the passage. Hofmann imports into it the idea: “that the spirits which have sway in the corporeal world might be tempted <span class="ital">to enter into that relation</span> to the woman <span class="ital">which is assigned to her husband</span>.” Hilgenfeld too, in his <span class="ital">Zeitschr.</span> 1864, p. 183, makes it refer to the story in the Book of Enoch, 5 f., about the transgression of the angels with the daughters of men.

P. cannot mean <span class="ital">evil</span> angels subject to sensual temptation, as many, after Tert[1648], have read the passage, basing it on a precarious interpretation of <a href="/genesis/6-4.htm" title="There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of men, and they bore children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.">Genesis 6:4</a> (see Everling, <span class="ital">Die paul.

Others have seen in these <span class="greekheb">ἄγγελοι</span> <span class="ital">pious men, prophets, Church-officers</span>, even <span class="ital">match-makers</span>!

Third argument, drawn from the presence of the angels at Christian worship. The word translated <span class="ital">power</span> here is rather, <span class="ital">the right to exercise power, authority</span>, as in St <a href="/matthew/10-1.htm" title="And when he had called to him his twelve disciples, he gave them power against unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease.">Matthew 10:1</a>.; St <a href="/luke/4-36.htm" title="And they were all amazed, and spoke among themselves, saying, What a word is this! for with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits, and they come out.">Luke 4:36</a>, &c. Hence it has been suggested in the notes on ch. <a href="/context/1_corinthians/9-4.htm" title="Have we not power to eat and to drink?...">1 Corinthians 9:4-5</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/9-12.htm" title="If others be partakers of this power over you, are not we rather? Nevertheless we have not used this power; but suffer all things, lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ.">1 Corinthians 9:12</a> that it has sometimes, though not here, the signification of <span class="ital">right</span>. In this place the abstract is put for the concrete, the authority itself for the token of being under authority. For an instance of the use of the veil in this way we may refer to <a href="/genesis/24-65.htm" title="For she had said to the servant, What man is this that walks in the field to meet us? And the servant had said, It is my master: therefore she took a veil, and covered herself.">Genesis 24:65</a>, where Rebekah veils herself in token of submission, as soon as she comes into the presence of her husband. We are not to exclude the idea of feminine modesty, but to regard it as included in the idea of being under authority, of which modesty is a kind of natural acknowledgment. Neither are we to confine the idea to <span class="ital">married</span> persons, as the margin of our Version does, but to regard it as applying to the mutual relations of the sexes generally. The passage has sorely perplexed the commentators. The various explanations of it may be found in Stanley and Alford <span class="ital">in loc</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">because of the angels</span>] This passage has also been explained in various ways (see the commentators just mentioned). It is best on the whole to regard it as an intimation that the angels, though invisible, were fellow-worshippers with men in the Christian assemblies, and were therefore “spectators of the indecency,” and liable to be offended thereat. “When therefore the women usurp the symbol of dominion, against what is right and lawful, they make their shameful conduct conspicuous” in the eyes of the messengers of God. Thus Calvin. Erasmus paraphrases it well: “If a woman has arrived at that pitch of shamelessness that she does not fear the eyes of men, let her at least cover her head on account of the angels, who are present at your assemblies.” For some remarkable Oriental illustrations of the interpretation that <span class="ital">evil</span> angels are here meant, see Dean Stanley on this verse.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/1_corinthians/11.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/1_corinthians/11-10.htm" title="For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels.">1 Corinthians 11:10</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ὀφείλει</span>, <span class="ital">ought</span>) This verb differs from <span class="greekheb">δεῖ</span>, it <span class="ital">is necessary:</span> <span class="greekheb">ὀφείλει</span> denotes obligation, <span class="greekheb">δεῖ</span>, necessity. The former is moral, the latter, as it were, physical necessity; as in the German, <span class="ital">wir sollen und müssen, we shall and must</span>.—<span class="greekheb">ἐξουσίαν ἔχειν</span>) <span class="ital">to have power over the head</span>. From that antithesis between <a href="/1_corinthians/11-7.htm" title="For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, for as much as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.">1 Corinthians 11:7</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/11-10.htm" title="For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels.">1 Corinthians 11:10</a> [<span class="ital">ought—ought not</span>], it is evident that the <span class="ital">power</span> is the same as <span class="greekheb">κάλυμμα</span>, <span class="ital">a covering:</span> so <a href="/genesis/20-16.htm" title="And to Sarah he said, Behold, I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to you a covering of the eyes, to all that are with you, and with all other: thus she was reproved.">Genesis 20:16</a>, <span class="greekheb">כסות עינים</span>. LXX, <span class="greekheb">εἰς τιμὴν τοῦ προσώπου σου</span>, for a covering, i.e., for a testimony of undefiled matrimonial chastity. On the contrary, the priest was commanded <span class="greekheb">ἀποκαλύπτειν</span>, to uncover the head of the woman, who had withdrawn from the power of her husband in consequence of adultery, or who was at least suspected of that crime. <a href="/numbers/5-18.htm" title="And the priest shall set the woman before the LORD, and uncover the woman's head, and put the offering of memorial in her hands, which is the jealousy offering: and the priest shall have in his hand the bitter water that causes the curse:">Numbers 5:18</a>. This passage agrees admirably with both quotations; only <span class="greekheb">ἐξουσία</span>, power, is a more suitable word here than <span class="greekheb">τιμὴ</span>, honour. Nor would it at all have been foreign to the purpose to compare <a href="/psalms/60-9.htm" title="Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into Edom?">Psalm 60:9</a>, Ephraim is the strength of my head. Paul uses <span class="greekheb">ἐξουσίαν</span> by an elegant metonymy of the sign for the thing signified; or even by a mild metonymy of the relative for the correlative, <span class="greekheb">ὑποταγὴ</span>, subjection, or the like; unless it be rather the sign, by which the woman avows and acknowledges that, although she prays and prophesies, still she is inferior to the man; in short, it is on this condition that the power of praying and prophesying falls to her share, and without that sign it must not be exercised. And this term is therefore more suitable, because it is closely connected with the <span class="greekheb">δόξα</span>, glory, <a href="/1_corinthians/11-15.htm" title="But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering.">1 Corinthians 11:15</a> : and <span class="greekheb">ἐξουσία</span>, power, is also applied to the angels.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To</span> <span class="cmt_word">have power on her head.</span> A great deal of irrelevant guesswork has been written on this verse. Under this head must be classed the idle attempts to twist the word <span class="accented">exousia</span>, power, or authority, into some other reading - an attempt which may be set aside, because it is not sanctioned by a single manuscript. We may also dismiss the futile efforts to make <span class="accented">exousia</span> have any other primary meaning than "authority." The <span class="accented">context</span> shows that the word has here a <span class="accented">secondary</span> sense, and implies <span class="accented">some kind of covering.</span> The verse, therefore, points the same lessons as <a href="/genesis/24-64.htm">Genesis 24:64, 65</a>. This much may be regarded as certain, and this view is adopted by the steadfast good sense of our English translators, both in the Authorized and Revised Versions. The only question worth asking is <span class="accented">why</span> the word <span class="accented">exousia</span> had come at Corinth, or in the Corinthian Church, to be used for "a veil," or "covering." The simplest answer is that just as the word "kingdom" in Greek may be used for "a crown" (comp. <span class="accented">regno</span> as the name of the pope's tiara), so "<span class="accented">authority"</span> may mean "<span class="accented">a</span> <span class="accented">sign of authority"</span> (Revised Version), or "a covering, in sign that she is under the power of her husband" (Authorized Version, margin). The margin of the Revised Version, "authority over her head," is a strange suggestion. Some have explained the word of <span class="accented">her own</span> true authority, which consists in accepting the rule of her husband; but it probably moans <span class="accented">a sign of her husband's authority over her.</span> Similarly the traveller Chardin says that in Persia the women wear a veil, in sign that they are "under subjection." If so, the best comment on the word may be found in the exquisite lines of Milton, which illustrate the passage in other ways also - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"She, as a vei1, down to the slender waist<br />Her unadorned golden tresses wore...<br />As the vine curves her tendrils, which implied<br />Subjection, but required with gentle sway,<br />And by her yielded, by him best received."</span> The fact that Callistratus twice uses <span class="accented">exousia</span> of "abundance of hair" is probably a mere coincidence, resembling the Irish expression "a power of hair." Nor can there be any allusion to the isolated fact that Samson's strength lay in his hair. The very brief comment of Luther sums up all the best of the many pages which have been written on the subject. He says that <span class="accented">exousia</span> means "the veil or covering, by which one may see that she is under her husband's authority" (<a href="/genesis/3-16.htm">Genesis 3:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Because of the angels.</span> In this clause also we must set aside, as idle waste of time, the attempts to alter the text, or to twist the plain words into impossible meanings. The word "angels" cannot mean "Church officials," or "holy men," or "prophets," or "delegates," or "'bridegroom's men," or anything but angels. Nor can the verse mean, as Bengel supposes, that women are to veil themselves because the angels do so (<a href="/isaiah/6-2.htm">Isaiah 6:2</a>), or (as Augustine says) because the angels approve of it. The only question is whether the allusion is to good or bad angels. In favour of the latter view is<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph"></span> the universal tradition among the Jews that the angels fell by lust for mortal women, which was the Jewish way of interpreting <a href="/genesis/6-1.htm">Genesis 6:1, 2</a>. This is the view of Tertullian ('De Virg. Vel.,' 7) in writing on this subject. A woman, in the opinion and traditions of Oriental Jews, is liable to injury from the <span class="accented">shedim</span>, if she appears in public unveiled; and these evil spirits are supposed to delight in the appearance of unveiled women. The objection to this view, that <span class="accented">angeloi</span> alone is never used of evil but always of good angels, is not perhaps decisive (see <a href="/1_corinthians/6-3.htm">1 Corinthians 6:3</a>). The verse may, however, mean (in accordance with the Jewish belief of those days) that good angels, being under the possibility of falling from the same cause as their evil brethren, fly away at once from the presence of unveiled women. Thus Khadijah tested that the visitant of her husband Mohammed really was the angel Gabriel, because he disappeared the moment she unveiled her head. On the whole, however, the meaning seems to be, <span class="accented">out of respect and reverence for the holy angels, who are always invisibly present in the Christian assemblies.</span> (On this point, see <a href="/luke/15-10.htm">Luke 15:10</a>; <a href="/ephesians/3-10.htm">Ephesians 3:10</a>; <a href="/hebrews/1-14.htm">Hebrews 1:14</a>; <a href="/hebrews/12-1.htm">Hebrews 12:1</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/138-1.htm">Psalm 138:1</a> [LXX.]; Tobit 12:12. See Latimer's 'Sermons,' p. 253). "Reverence the angels" is St. Chrysostom's remark. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/1_corinthians/11.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Power on her head (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;)<p>Not in the primary sense of liberty or permission, but authority. Used here of the symbol of power, i.e., the covering upon the head as a sign of her husband's authority. So Rev., a sign of authority.<p>Because of the angels<p>The holy angels, who were supposed by both the Jewish and the early Christian Church to be present in worshipping assemblies. More, however, seems to be meant than "to avoid exciting disapproval among them." The key-note of Paul's thought is subordination according to the original divine order. Woman best asserts her spiritual equality before God, not by unsexing herself, but by recognizing her true position and fulfilling its claims, even as do the angels, who are ministering as well as worshipping spirits (<a href="/hebrews/1-4.htm">Hebrews 1:4</a>). She is to fall in obediently with that divine economy of which she forms a part with the angels, and not to break the divine harmony, which especially asserts itself in worship, where the angelic ministers mingle with the earthly worshippers; nor to ignore the example of the holy ones who keep their first estate, and serve in the heavenly sanctuary. </body></html>
