To these charity-feasts the Christians brought contributions of food—the rich of their abundance, the poor whatever they could afford—and the food thus provided was partaken of in common by all.

Christ having instituted his supper after he had eaten the passover, the disciples very early made it a rule to feast together before they ate the Lord’s supper. These feasts were called <span class="greekheb">αγαπαι</span>, <span class="ital">charitates, love-feasts. </span>They are mentioned, Jude, <a href="/1_corinthians/11-12.htm" title="For as the woman is of the man, even so is the man also by the woman; but all things of God.">1 Corinthians 11:12</a>, as also by some of the ancient Christian writers. From Xenophon, (see <span class="ital">Memorab., </span>lib. 3. cap. 14,) we learn that the Greeks, when they supped together, brought each his own provisions ready dressed, which they ate in company together. Probably the Corinthians followed the same practice, in their feasts previous to the Lord’s supper.” <span class="ital">And one is hungry, and another is drunken </span>— Or rather, <span class="ital">is filled, </span>or <span class="ital">plentifully fed, </span>“as <span class="greekheb">μεθυειν </span>signifies here, being opposed to <span class="ital">one is hungry. </span>The word is used in this sense by the LXX., <a href="/psalms/35-9.htm" title="And my soul shall be joyful in the LORD: it shall rejoice in his salvation.">Psalm 35:9</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/38-14.htm" title="Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took Jeremiah the prophet to him into the third entry that is in the house of the LORD: and the king said to Jeremiah, I will ask you a thing; hide nothing from me.">Jeremiah 38:14</a>; <a href="/john/2-10.htm" title="And said to him, Every man at the beginning does set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: but you have kept the good wine until now.">John 2:10</a>; where it is rendered by our translators, <span class="ital">when men have well drunk, </span>drunk plentifully.

The ordinances of Christ, if they do not make us better, will be apt to make us worse. If the use of them does not mend, it will harden. Upon coming together, they fell into divisions, schisms. Christians may separate from each other's communion, yet be charitable one towards another; they may continue in the same communion, yet be uncharitable. This last is schism, rather than the former. There is a careless and irregular eating of the Lord's supper, which adds to guilt. Many rich Corinthians seem to have acted very wrong at the Lord's table, or at the love-feasts, which took place at the same time as the supper. The rich despised the poor, and ate and drank up the provisions they brought, before the poor were allowed to partake; thus some wanted, while others had more than enough. What should have been a bond of mutual love and affection, was made an instrument of discord and disunion. We should be careful that nothing in our behaviour at the Lord's table, appears to make light of that sacred institution. The Lord's supper is not now made an occasion for gluttony or revelling, but is it not often made the support of self-righteous pride, or a cloak for hypocrisy? Let us never rest in the outward forms of worship; but look to our hearts.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>When ye come together therefore ... - When you are assembled as a church, compare <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/10-25.htm">Hebrews 10:25</a>, and see the note on <a href="/acts/2-1.htm">Acts 2:1</a>. Christians were constantly in the habit of assembling for public worship. It is probable that at this early period all the Christians in Corinth were accustomed to meet in the same place. The apostle here particularly refers to their "assembling" to observe the ordinance of the Lord's Supper. At that early period it is probable that this was done on every Lord's Day.<p>This is not ... - Margin, "Ye cannot eat." The meaning of this expression seems to be this. "Though you come together professedly to worship God, and to partake of the Lord's Supper, yet this cannot be the real design which you have in view. It cannot be that such practices as are allowed among you can be a part of the celebration of that supper, or consistent with it. Your greediness <a href="/1_corinthians/11-21.htm">1 Corinthians 11:21</a>; your intemperance <a href="/1_corinthians/11-21.htm">1 Corinthians 11:21</a>; your partaking of the food separately and not in common, cannot be a celebration of the Lord's Supper. Whatever, therefore, you may profess to be engaged in, yet really and truly you are not celebrating the Lord's Supper."<p>The Lord's supper - That which the Lord Jesus instituted to commemorate his death. It is called "the Lord's," because it is his appointment, and is in honor of him; it is called "supper" (&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  deipnon), because the word denotes the evening repast; it was instituted in the evening; and it is evidently most proper that it should be observed in the after part of the day. With most churches the time is improperly changed to the morning - a custom which has no sanction in the New Testament; and which is a departure from the very idea of a supper. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20. When &#8230; therefore&#8212;Resuming the thread of discourse from 1Co 11:18.<p>this is not to&#8212;rather, "there is no such thing as eating the Lord's Supper"; it is not possible where each is greedily intent only on devouring "HIS OWN supper," and some are excluded altogether, not having been waited for (1Co 11:33), where some are "drunken," while others are "hungry" (1Co 11:21). The love-feast usually preceded the Lord's Supper (as eating the Passover came before the Lord's Supper at the first institution of the latter). It was a club-feast, where each brought his portion, and the rich, extra portions for the poor; from it the bread and wine were taken for the Eucharist; and it was at it that the excesses took place, which made a true celebration of the Lord's Supper during or after it, with true discernment of its solemnity, out of the question.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_corinthians/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The Greek words do not necessarily signify <span class="ital">into one place, </span> they may as well be translated, for the same thing, and possibly that were the better translation of them in this place; divisions appearing the worse amongst persons that met as one and the same body, and for one and the same grave action, and that such an action as declared them one body, and laid upon them the highest obligation to brotherly love imaginable. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">This is not to eat the Lord’s supper:</span> some words must be here supplied to complete the sense. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">This is not to eat; </span> that is, as you do it is indeed not to do it; to eat the Lord’s supper in an unlawful manner, is not to eat it. It is called <span class="ital">the Lord’s supper, </span> either because he ordained and instituted it, or because it was instituted for the remembrance of his death, <span class="bld"><a href="/1_corinthians/11-26.htm" title="For as often as you eat this bread, and drink this cup, you do show the Lord's death till he come.">1 Corinthians 11:26</a> <a href="/luke/22-19.htm" title="And he took bread, and gave thanks, and broke it, and gave to them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me.">Luke 22:19</a></span>. Some think that the sacrament of the Lord’s supper is here meant, and so one would think, by comparing what is here with <span class="bld"><a href="/1_corinthians/11-23.htm" title="For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered to you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread:">1 Corinthians 11:23</a>,24</span>. Others say, that the love feast is here intended, which ordinarily preceded the Lord’s supper; the reason they give is, because the abuses here mentioned, viz. not staying one for another till the whole church were met, one eating plentifully, another sparingly, some being hungry while others had ate and drank enough, could not be at the Lord’s supper, where the minister beginneth not till the whole church be assembled, and where there is no such liberal eating and drinking. To this purpose we are told, that by an ancient custom in Greece (within which Corinth was) the rich men offered some things to their idols, (which after that action the poor had for their relief), and made feasts in the idol’s temples, of which all had a liberty to eat. That the Christians imitated this practice of theirs, and the rich amongst them upon the Lord’s days made feasts, at which both poor and rich Christians might be, and the poor carried away what was left. But this church growing corrupt every way, and having got teachers to their humours, they at these feasts neglected the poor, inviting only the rich to them, and also exceeding in their provision for their rich guests. These feasts were called feasts of love, or love feasts, either because: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. Love to God was that which (pretendedly at least) caused them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. Or because they were representations of our Lord’s last supper, in which he first ate the paschal lamb, then instituted what we call the Lord’s supper; or because they immediately preceded or followed the administration of the Lord’s supper, from whence the love feast, being immediately before or after it, had also the same name. But if we allow this, we must make the love feasts also Christ’s institution, and instituted in remembrance of him, neither of which can be proved. The meaning must be: You cannot rightly communicate at the Lord’s table, when immediately before or after that table, at your love feast, you are guilty of such disorderly actions. In the mean time, only what Christ instituted for remembrance of his death is what the apostle calls <span class="ital">the Lord’s supper.</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_corinthians/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>When ye come together therefore into one place,.... Though    does not signify so much the unity of the place, as of the persons meeting together, and their conjunction; so the phrase is used by the Septuagint, in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/25-11.htm">Deuteronomy 25:11</a>, yet it supposes a place where the church were wont to assemble for divine worship; <p>this is not to eat the Lord's supper: their view in coming together was not so much to celebrate the supper of the Lord, as to partake of their own supper, which was either the paschal supper, or something like it; which many of them "judaizing" observed before the Lord's supper, in imitation of Christ, as they pretended, who first ate the passover, and then instituted the supper. Now there being a great deal of good eating and drinking in this ante-supper, many of them came together for no other end but to partake of that, at least this was their chief view, and not the Lord's supper; or when they did meet together on this account, it was in such an irregular and disorderly manner, and they confounded these suppers together, and behaved so ill at them, and ate the Lord's supper so unworthily, that it could not be rightly called eating of it; or when they had eaten their ante-supper in such an indecent way, neither staying for one another, nor keeping within the bounds of temperance and sobriety; at least having indulged their carnal appetites to such a degree, and raised themselves to such a pitch of gaiety and cheerfulness; it was not fit for them to eat the Lord's supper, to go from such a full meal to the table of the Lord. This was called the Lord's supper, because he was the author of it; and he is the subject of it; and for him, the remembrance of him, it is appointed, kept up, and continued. The Syriac version understands it of the Lord's day, and reads it thus, "when therefore ye meet together, not as is fit for", or becomes, , "the day of our Lord, do ye eat and drink". <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_corinthians/11.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">When ye come together therefore into one place, <i>this</i> is <span class="cverse3">{g}</span> not to eat the Lord's supper.</span><p>(g) This is a usual metaphor by which the apostle flatly denies that which many did not do well.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/1_corinthians/11.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/1_corinthians/11-20.htm" title="When you come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lord's supper.">1 Corinthians 11:20</a>. <span class="greekheb">Οὖν</span>] resuming after the parenthesis; see on <a href="/1_corinthians/11-18.htm" title="For first of all, when you come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it.">1 Corinthians 11:18</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτό</span>] <span class="ital">to the same place</span>.

This Church-supper, afterwards called the Agapé (see <span class="ital">Dict. of Christian Antiq. s.v</span>.; also Ed[1720] <span class="ital">ad loc</span>[1721]) was analogous to the <span class="greekheb">συσσίτια</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἔρανοι</span> held by the guilds and friendly societies then rife amongst the Greeks. Originating as a kind of enlarged family meal in the Church of Jerus. (<a href="/acts/2-46.htm" title="And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart,">Acts 2:46</a>), the practice of the common supper accorded so well with social custom that it was universal amongst Christians in the first century (see Weizsäcker’s <span class="ital">Apost. Age</span>, vol. ii., pp. 279–286). Gradually the Eucharist was separated from the Agapé for greater decorum, and the latter degenerated and became extinct; here they are one, as in the Last Supper itself. The table was provisioned at Cor[1722] not from a general fund (as was usual in the <span class="greekheb">ἔρανοι</span> or <span class="ital">collegia</span>), but by each guest bringing his contribution in kind, a practice not uncommon in private parties, which had the disadvantage of accentuating social differences. While the poor brought little or nothing to the feast and might be ashamed to show his fare, the rich man exhibited a loaded basket out of which he could feed to repletion. All <span class="greekheb">κοινωνία</span> was destroyed; such vulgarity would have disgraced a heathen guild-feast. The <span class="ital">Lord</span>, the common Host, was forgotten at His table. <span class="greekheb">ὅς μὲν πεινᾷ</span>—<span class="ital">sc</span>. the poor man, whose small store was insufficient, or who arriving late (for his time was not his own) found the table cleared (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <span class="greekheb">προλαμβάνει</span>). <span class="greekheb">ὃς δὲ μεθύει</span>, “but another is drunk!” or in the lighter sense suggested by <span class="greekheb">πεινῷ</span>, <span class="ital">plus satis bibit</span> (Gr[1723], Hn[1724]), “drinks to the full” (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/john/2-10.htm" title="And said to him, Every man at the beginning does set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: but you have kept the good wine until now.">John 2:10</a>); the scene of sensual greed and pride might well culminate in drunkenness. Of all imaginable schisms the most shocking: hunger and intoxication side by side, at what is supposed to be the Table of the Lord! This is indeed “meeting for the worse”.—For the demonstr. use of the rel[1725] pron[1726] with <span class="greekheb">μὲν</span> and <span class="greekheb">δέ</span>, see Wr[1727], p. 130.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1697] Corinth, Corinthian or Corinthians.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1698] Corinth, Corinthian or Corinthians.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1699] Alford’s <span class="ital">Greek Testament</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1700] Corinth, Corinthian or Corinthians.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1701] Beza’s <span class="ital">Nov.

The Eucharist proper was originally celebrated as a private expression of devotion, and in connection with a common, daily meal, an agape or love-feast. In the apostolic period it was celebrated daily. The social and festive character of the meal grew largely out of the gentile institution of clubs or fraternities, which served as savings-banks, mutual-help societies, insurance offices, and which expressed and fostered the spirit of good-fellowship by common festive meals, usually in gardens, round an altar of sacrifice. The communion-meal of the first and second centuries exhibited this character in being a feast of contribution, to which each brought his own provision. It also perpetuated the Jewish practice of the college of priests for the temple-service dining at a common table on festivals or Sabbaths, and of the schools of the Pharisees in their ordinary life.<p>Indications of the blending of the eucharistic celebration with a common meal are found here, <a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/20-7.htm">Acts 20:7</a>, and more obscurely, <a href="/acts/27-35.htm">Acts 27:35</a>. </body></html>
