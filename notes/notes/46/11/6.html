It is as if the Apostle said—If a woman insists on her right to pray and speak in an assembly with uncovered head, let her carry out this principle to its logical result; let her insist on her right to have her hair cut short, so as to show her equality with man—and what would be thought of her then! No woman with a spark of shame in her would think of doing that. Accordingly you admit that this principle of sexual equality does not apply in all such matters; and it is illogical to argue in favour of any general principle as if it were of universal obligation, when you yourselves admit that it is not applicable in some cases.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:2-16 Here begin particulars respecting the public assemblies, ch. 1Co 14. In the abundance of spiritual gifts bestowed on the Corinthians, some abuses had crept in; but as Christ did the will, and sought the honour of God, so the Christian should avow his subjection to Christ, doing his will and seeking his glory. We should, even in our dress and habit, avoid every thing that may dishonour Christ. The woman was made subject to man, because made for his help and comfort. And she should do nothing, in Christian assemblies, which looked like a claim of being equal. She ought to have power, that is, a veil, on her head, because of the angels. Their presence should keep Christians from all that is wrong while in the worship of God. Nevertheless, the man and the woman were made for one another. They were to be mutual comforts and blessings, not one a slave, and the other a tyrant. God has so settled matters, both in the kingdom of providence and that of grace, that the authority and subjection of each party should be for mutual help and benefit. It was the common usage of the churches, for women to appear in public assemblies, and join in public worship, veiled; and it was right that they should do so. The Christian religion sanctions national customs wherever these are not against the great principles of truth and holiness; affected singularities receive no countenance from any thing in the Bible.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For if the woman be not covered - If her head be not covered with a veil.<p>Let her also be shorn - Let her long hair be cut off.

Thus the shaving of nuns is "a shame."<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_corinthians/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn:</span> nature itself teacheth, that it is a shameful sight to see a woman revealing the mind and will of God, by an extraordinary pretended revelation, in so indecent a manner, as with her hair all hanging down; let her hair be either shaven off, or at least cut after the manner of men’s hair, if she will neither tie it up artificially, so as to make it a covering for her head, nor put on a veil to cover her: for though a woman prophesying from an extraordinary impulse, be not under the common law of women not speaking in the public assembly, but keeping silence; yet she is under the law of nature to do no such grave and solemn actions in such a rude manner, that from the light of nature, or the common account of all that live in that place, she should be judged to be irreverent and brutish in her religious action. From this text a question hath been started: Whether Christian women may lawfully go without any other covering upon their heads than their hair? I must confess, I see not how such a question can have any bottom in this text, where the apostle is not speaking of women’s ordinary habiting themselves, but only when they prayed and prophesied, and (if I mistake not) when they ministered in prayer and prophecy (as was said before). We now have no such prophetesses; so as I think that question about the lawfulness of women’s going without any other covering upon their heads than their hair, must be determined from other texts, not this, and is best determined from circumstances; for God having given to the woman her hair for a covering and an ornament, I cannot see how it should be simply unlawful; accidentally it may, from the circumstances of pride in her heart that so dresseth herself, or lust and wantonness in others’ hearts; or other circumstances of ill designs and intentions in the woman so dressing herself. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">But if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered; </span> if nature teacheth us that it is a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, it also teacheth us that it is a shame for her to be uncovered, either with her hair, or some artificial covering; which latter seemeth rather to be meant in this place, because divines think, that the face is that part of the head which the apostle here intendeth should be covered in their religious actions, which is not covered with the hair, but with a veil, &c. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_corinthians/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For if the woman be not covered,....

That ground is, that the step from not being covered to being shorn is only what <span class="ital">consistency demands</span>, while the dishonour again implied in being shorn requires that the woman should be covered; consequently, to be uncovered lies by no means midway between being shorn and being covered as a thing indifferent, but falls under the same moral category as being shorn. <span class="ital">For when a woman puts on no covering</span>, when she has once become <span class="ital">so</span> shameless, <span class="ital">then she should have herself shorn too</span> (in addition).

P. uses the <span class="ital">modus tollens</span> of the hypothetical syllogism: “If a woman prefers a bare head, she should remove her hair; womanly feeling forbids the latter, then it should forbid the former, for the like shame attaches to both.” The argument appeals to Gr[1621] and Eastern sentiment; “physical barefacedness led to the inference of moral, in a city like Corinth” (Ev[1622]). <span class="greekheb">κειράσθω</span> and <span class="greekheb">κείρασθαι</span>, aor[1623] mid[1624], denote a single act on the woman’s part, “to cut off her locks”; <span class="greekheb">ξυρᾶσθαι</span>, pres. mid[1625],—a shaven condition; the single art[1626] comprises the infs. in one view.—Paul’s directions do not agree precisely with current practice. Jewish men covered their heads at prayers with the Tallith (<span class="ital">cf.</span> the allusion of <a href="/2_corinthians/3-14.htm" title="But their minds were blinded: for until this day remains the same veil not taken away in the reading of the old testament; which veil is done away in Christ.">2 Corinthians 3:14</a> ff.)—this custom, retained probably by some Jews at Christian meetings (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-4.htm" title="Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonors his head.">1 Corinthians 11:4</a>), P. corrects without censure; women were both veiled and kept behind a screen. Amongst the Greeks, both sexes worshipped with <span class="ital">uncovered</span> head, although women covered their heads at other times (see Hermann, <span class="ital">Gottesdienstl. Alterthümer</span>, § 36, 18 f.; Plato, <span class="ital">Phœdo</span>, 89B, ), while Roman men and women alike <span class="ital">covered</span> their heads during religious rites (Servius <span class="ital">ad Æn</span>., iii., 407). The usage here prescribed seems to be an adaptation of Gr[1627] custom to Christian conceptions. With us the diff[1628] of sex is more strongly marked in the general attire than with the ancients; but the draped head has still its appropriateness, and the distinction laid down in this passage has been universally observed.—The woman is recognised by the side of the man as “praying” and “prophesying” (see note on <a href="/1_corinthians/12-10.htm" title="To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues:">1 Corinthians 12:10</a>); there is no ground in the text for limiting the ref[1629] in her case to the exercise of these gifts <span class="ital">in domestic and private circles</span> (thus Hf[1630], Bt[1631], and some others); on the contradiction with <a href="/1_corinthians/14-34.htm" title="Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted to them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience as also said the law.">1 Corinthians 14:34</a>, see note <span class="ital">ad loc</span>[1632] Under the Old Covenant women were at times signally endued with supernatural powers, and the prophetess occasionally played a leading public part (<span class="ital">e.g</span>.
