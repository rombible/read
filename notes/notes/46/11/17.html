There were evidently three great abuses which had crept into the Church:—1. The discarding by the women of the covering for their heads. This only concerned one sex, and has been treated of in the earlier part of this chapter. The other two affect both sexes. 2. The disorders at the Lord’s Supper. 3. The misuse of spiritual gifts. The former of these occupies the remainder of this chapter, while the latter is discussed in <a href="/context/1_corinthians/12-1.htm" title="Now concerning spiritual gifts, brothers, I would not have you ignorant.">1Corinthians 12:1-30</a>. To render the Greek word “I declare,” as in the Authorised version, and so make it refer to what is about to follow, gives a more logical completeness to the passage, but it is scarcely allowable, as the Greek word elsewhere always means a distinct command (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-10.htm" title="And to the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from her husband:">1Corinthians 7:10</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-11.htm" title="And that you study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you;">1Thessalonians 4:11</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-6.htm" title="Now we command you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you withdraw yourselves from every brother that walks disorderly, and not after the tradition which he received of us.">2Thessalonians 3:6</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-10.htm" title="For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat.">2Thessalonians 3:10</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-12.htm" title="Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread.">2Thessalonians 3:12</a>, <span class= "ital">et al.</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> Others have suggested that St. Paul anticipates in thought the practical direction which occurs in <a href="/1_corinthians/11-34.htm" title="And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that you come not together to condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come.">1Corinthians 11:34</a>, and alludes to it here in the words, “This I command you.” This view is open to the objections (1) that it completely isolates <a href="/1_corinthians/11-17.htm" title="Now in this that I declare to you I praise you not, that you come together not for the better, but for the worse.">1Corinthians 11:17</a> from <a href="/1_corinthians/11-16.htm" title="But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.">1Corinthians 11:16</a>, while the Greek evidently intimates a connection between them; (2) that it is unnatural to separate the statement so far from the command to which it refers. It is better to regard these words as given above—forming a sort of intellectual isthmus connecting the two wide fields of thought which the earlier and later portions of the chapter embrace.<p><span class= "bld">I praise you not.</span>—This carries the thought back to <a href="/1_corinthians/11-2.htm" title="Now I praise you, brothers, that you remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered them to you.">1Corinthians 11:2</a>, and shows that the commendation expressed there is still the writer’s starting-point, or rather the point of departure from which he proceeds to censure.<p><span class= "bld">That ye come together.</span>—Although in the English version the word “you” is inserted (“I praise <span class= "ital">you</span> not”), it does not occur in the Greek. The passage is not, “I do not praise you because, &c.,” but, “I do not praise your coming together not for the better, but for the worse.” These words introduce the new topic which follows.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_corinthians/11.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/1_corinthians/11-17.htm" title="Now in this that I declare to you I praise you not, that you come together not for the better, but for the worse....">1 Corinthians 11:17-19</a></span>. <span class="ital">Now in this that I </span>am about to <span class="ital">declare unto you, I praise you not </span>— I cannot commend some, as I have done others, (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-2.htm" title="Now I praise you, brothers, that you remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered them to you.">1 Corinthians 11:2</a>,) for other things; <span class="ital">that ye come together </span>— Frequently, and even on the most solemn occasions; <span class="ital">not for the better — </span>So as to gain any spiritual advantage by the increase of your faith and other graces; <span class="ital">but for the worse</span> — To the prejudice of your souls, by fomenting strifes and animosities, which produce factions. <span class="ital">For first of all </span>— Before I mention any other instance of your irregular and indecent conduct, I must observe, that <span class="ital">when ye come together in the church </span>— <span class="greekheb">Εν τη εκκλησια</span>, <span class="ital">in the </span>public <span class="ital">assembly, </span>though it is evident that nothing but reverence to God, and love to each other, should reign on such occasions; <span class="ital">I hear that there be divisions </span>— <span class="greekheb">Σχισματα</span>, schisms; <span class="ital">among you, and I partly believe it </span>— That is, I believe it of some of you. It is plain that by <span class="ital">schisms </span>is not meant any <span class="ital">separation </span>from the church, but uncharitable <span class="ital">divisions </span>in it. For the Corinthians continued to be one church, and notwithstanding all their strife and contention, there was no separation of any one party from the rest, with regard to external communion. And it is in the same sense that the word is used, <a href="/1_corinthians/1-10.htm" title="Now I beseech you, brothers, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that you be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.">1 Corinthians 1:10</a>, and <a href="/1_corinthians/12-25.htm" title="That there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another.">1 Corinthians 12:25</a>, which are the only places in the New Testament, besides this, where <span class="ital">church schisms </span>are mentioned. Therefore, the indulging any temper contrary to this tender <span class="ital">care </span>of each other, is the true Scriptural <span class="ital">schism. </span>This is, therefore, a quite different thing from that orderly separation from corrupt churches which later ages have stigmatized as <span class="ital">schism; </span>and have made a pretence for the vilest cruelties, oppressions, and murders, that have troubled the Christian world. Both <span class="ital">heresies </span>and <span class="ital">schisms </span>are here mentioned in very near the same sense: unless by <span class="ital">schisms </span>be meant rather those inward animosities which occasion <span class="ital">heresies; </span>that is, outward divisions or parties: so that while one said, I am of Paul, another, I am of Apollos, this implied both <span class="ital">schism </span>and <span class="ital">heresy. </span>So wonderfully have later ages distorted the words <span class="ital">heresy </span>and <span class="ital">schism </span>from their Scriptural meaning. <span class="ital">Heresy </span>is not, in all the Bible, taken for “an error in fundamentals,” or in any thing else; nor <span class="ital">schism, </span>for any separation made from the outward communion of others. Therefore, both <span class="ital">heresy </span>and <span class="ital">schism, </span>in the modern sense of the words, are sins that the Scripture knows nothing of; but were invented merely to deprive mankind of the benefit of private judgment, and liberty of conscience. <span class="ital">For there must also be heresies among you </span>—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Parties formed, as the word <span class="greekheb">αιρεσεις </span>properly signifies. These, in the ordinary course of things, must take place, in consequence of your contentions, and the declension of your love to one another: and God permits these divisions, <span class="ital">that they which are approved may be manifest </span>— That it may appear who among you are, and who are not, upright of heart. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:17-22 The apostle rebukes the disorders in their partaking of the Lord's supper. The ordinances of Christ, if they do not make us better, will be apt to make us worse. If the use of them does not mend, it will harden. Upon coming together, they fell into divisions, schisms. Christians may separate from each other's communion, yet be charitable one towards another; they may continue in the same communion, yet be uncharitable. This last is schism, rather than the former. There is a careless and irregular eating of the Lord's supper, which adds to guilt. Many rich Corinthians seem to have acted very wrong at the Lord's table, or at the love-feasts, which took place at the same time as the supper. The rich despised the poor, and ate and drank up the provisions they brought, before the poor were allowed to partake; thus some wanted, while others had more than enough. What should have been a bond of mutual love and affection, was made an instrument of discord and disunion. We should be careful that nothing in our behaviour at the Lord's table, appears to make light of that sacred institution. The Lord's supper is not now made an occasion for gluttony or revelling, but is it not often made the support of self-righteous pride, or a cloak for hypocrisy? Let us never rest in the outward forms of worship; but look to our hearts.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Now in this that I declare - In this that I am about to state to you; to wit, your conduct in regard to the Lord's Supper. Why this subject is introduced here is not very apparent. The connection may be this. In the subjects immediately preceding he had seen much to commend, and he was desirous of commending them as far as it could be done. In <a href="/1_corinthians/11-2.htm">1 Corinthians 11:2</a> of this chapter he commends them in general for their regard to the ordinances which he had appointed when he was with them. But while he thus commended them, he takes occasion to observe that there was one subject on which he could not employ the language of approval or praise. Of their irregularities in regard to the Lord's supper he had probably heard by rumor, and as the subject was of great importance, and their irregularities gross and deplorable, he takes occasion to state to them again more fully the nature of that ordinance, and to reprove them for the manner in which they had celebrated it.<p>That ye come together - You assemble for public worship.<p>Not for the better, but for the worse - Your meetings, and your observance of the ordinances of the gospel, do not promote your edification, your piety, spirituality, and harmony; but tend to division, alienation, and disorder. You should assemble to worship God, and promote harmony, love, and piety; the actual effect of your assembling is just the reverse. In what way this was done he states in the following verses. These evil consequences were chiefly two, first, divisions and contentions; and, secondly, the abuse and profanation of the Lord's Supper. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17. in this&#8212;which follows.<p>I declare&#8212;rather, "I enjoin"; as the Greek is always so used.

In reply P. has just pointed out one serious irregularity, which might indeed be put down to ignorance (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-3.htm" title="But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.">1 Corinthians 11:3</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/11-16.htm" title="But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.">1 Corinthians 11:16</a>). No such excuse is possible in regard to the disorders he has now to speak of, which are reported to him on evidence that he cannot discredit (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-18.htm" title="For first of all, when you come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it.">1 Corinthians 11:18</a>)—<span class="ital">viz., the divisions apparent in the Church meetings</span> (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-19.htm" title="For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you.">1 Corinthians 11:19</a>), and <span class="ital">the gross selfishness and sensuality displayed at the common meals</span> (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-20.htm" title="When you come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lord's supper.">1 Corinthians 11:20</a> ff.). Such behaviour he certainly cannot praise (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-17.htm" title="Now in this that I declare to you I praise you not, that you come together not for the better, but for the worse.">1 Corinthians 11:17</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/11-22.htm" title="What? have you not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise you the church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not.">1 Corinthians 11:22</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1665] Corinth, Corinthian or Corinthians.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/1_corinthians/11.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>17–34.

He could not praise them for their irregularities in a matter on which their Christian instincts ought to have enlightened them.
