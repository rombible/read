In the abundance of spiritual gifts bestowed on the Corinthians, some abuses had crept in; but as Christ did the will, and sought the honour of God, so the Christian should avow his subjection to Christ, doing his will and seeking his glory. We should, even in our dress and habit, avoid every thing that may dishonour Christ. The woman was made subject to man, because made for his help and comfort. And she should do nothing, in Christian assemblies, which looked like a claim of being equal. She ought to have power, that is, a veil, on her head, because of the angels. Their presence should keep Christians from all that is wrong while in the worship of God. Nevertheless, the man and the woman were made for one another. They were to be mutual comforts and blessings, not one a slave, and the other a tyrant. God has so settled matters, both in the kingdom of providence and that of grace, that the authority and subjection of each party should be for mutual help and benefit. It was the common usage of the churches, for women to appear in public assemblies, and join in public worship, veiled; and it was right that they should do so. The Christian religion sanctions national customs wherever these are not against the great principles of truth and holiness; affected singularities receive no countenance from any thing in the Bible.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Nevertheless - Lest the man should assume to himself too much superiority, and lest he should regard the woman as made solely for his pleasure, and should treat her as in all respects inferior, and withhold the respect that is due to her. The design of this verse and the following is to show, that the man and woman are united in the most tender interests; that the one cannot live comfortably without the other; that one is necessary to the happiness of the other; and that though the woman was formed from the man, yet it is also to be remembered that the man is descended from the woman. She should therefore be treated with proper respect, tenderness, and regard.<p>Neither is the man without the woman ... - The man and the woman were formed for union and society. They are not in any respect independent of each other. One is necessary to the comfort of the other; and this fact should be recognized in all their contact.<p>In the Lord - By the arrangements or direction of the Lord. It is the appointment and command of the Lord that they should be mutual helps, and should each regard and promote the welfare of the other. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. Yet neither sex is insulated and independent of the other in the Christian life [Alford]. The one needs the other in the sexual relation; and in respect to Christ ("in the Lord"), the man and the woman together (for neither can be dispensed with) realize the ideal of redeemed humanity represented by the bride, the Church.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_corinthians/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Lest the man, upon the apostle’s discourse of his pre-eminence and dignity over the woman, should wax proud and insolent, and carry himself too imperiously, the apostle addeth this, that they both stand in need of each other’s help, so as neither of them could well be without the other, either as to matters that concern God, or that concern the world; the Lord so ordering and disposing it, that they should be mutual helps one to another. Or else the sense is, they are equal in the Lord as to a state of grace, in Christ there is <span class="ital">neither male nor female:</span> though there be a difference between a man and woman in other things, and the man hath the priority and superiority; yet when we come to consider them as to their spiritual state, and in their spiritual reference, there is no difference. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_corinthians/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Nevertheless, neither is the man without the woman,.... This is said, partly to repress the pride and insolence of man, that he might not be too much elated with himself, and his superiority over the woman, and look with any degree of disdain and contempt upon her, and treat her with indifference and neglect; and partly to comfort the woman, that she might not be dejected with the condition and circumstances in which she was, since the one is not without the other; nor can they be so truly comfortable and happy, as not the man without the woman, who was made for an help meet for him, <p>so neither the woman without the man in the Lord. The phrase "in the Lord" is added, to show that it is the will of God, and according to his ordination and appointment, that the one should not be without the other; or it may design that lawful conjunction and copulation, of one man and one woman together, according to the will of the Lord, which distinguishes it from all other impure mixtures and copulations. The Arabic version reads it, "in the religion of the Lord"; and the sense is, that the one is not without the other in religious worship, and in the enjoyment of religious privileges; that though the woman may not pray publicly and expound the Scriptures, yet she may join in prayer, and hear the word preached, sing the praises of God, and enjoy all ordinances; for in Christ no distinction of sex is regarded, men and women are all one in him, and equally regenerated, justified, and pardoned, and will be glorified together. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_corinthians/11.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{11}</span> Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> in the Lord.</span><p>(11) A digression which the apostle uses, lest that which he spoke of the superiority of men, and the lower degree of women, in consideration of the policy of the Church, should be so taken as though there were no measure of this inequality. Therefore he teaches that men have in such sort the preeminence, that God made them not alone, but women also. And woman was so made of man, that men also are born by the means of women, and this ought to put them in mind to observe the degree of every sex in such sort, that the marriage relationship may be cherished.<p>(d) By the Lord.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/1_corinthians/11.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/1_corinthians/11-11.htm" title="Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord.">1 Corinthians 11:11</a>.

Hence the caveat which now follows (<span class="greekheb">ἐπάγει τὴν διόρθωσιν</span>, Chrys.) against the possible dislocation of the <span class="ital">Christian</span> relation of the two sexes: <span class="ital">nevertheless, neither is the woman without the man, nor the man without the woman in Christ, i.e.</span> nevertheless there subsists such a relation between the two in the sphere of the Christian life (<span class="greekheb">ἐν Κυρίῳ</span>), that neither does the woman stand severed from the man, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> independent of, and without bond of fellowship with, him, nor <span class="ital">vice versâ</span>. They are united as Christian spouses (comp <a href="/1_corinthians/11-3.htm" title="But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.">1 Corinthians 11:3</a>) in mutual dependence, each belonging to the other and supplying what the other lacks; neither of the parties being a separate independent person. The <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ ΚΥΡΊῼ</span></span></span> thus assigns to the relation here expressed the distinctive sphere, in which it subsists. Out of Christ, in a profane marriage of this world, the case would be different. Were we, with Storr, Heydenreich, Rückert, Hofmann, to take <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ ΚΥΡΊῼ</span></span></span> as predicative definition: “neither does the woman stand in connection with Christ without the man, nor <span class="ital">vice versâ</span>,” this would resolve itself either into the meaning given by Grotius: “Dominus neque viros exclusis feminis, neque feminas exclusis viris redemit;” or into Hofmann’s interpretation, that in a Christian marriage the relation to the Lord is a common one, shared in by the two parties alike. But both of these ideas are far too obvious, general, and commonplace to suit the context. Olshausen (comp Beza) renders it, “<span class="ital">by the arrangement of God</span>.” But <span class="greekheb">ἐν Κυρίῳ</span> is the <span class="ital">statedly used</span> term for <span class="ital">Christ</span>; the reference to the <span class="ital">divine</span> arrangement comes in afterwards in <a href="/1_corinthians/11-12.htm" title="For as the woman is of the man, even so is the man also by the woman; but all things of God.">1 Corinthians 11:12</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/1_corinthians/11.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/context/1_corinthians/11-11.htm" title="Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord....">1 Corinthians 11:11-12</a>. <span class="greekheb">πλὴν κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. modifies and guards the foregoing; this conj. lies between <span class="greekheb">δὲ</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἀλλὰ</span> in its force—<span class="ital">but besides, howbeit</span>.
