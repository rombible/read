He should be fixed in the faith of the gospel, and never desert or give it up. By this faith alone he will be able to keep his ground in an hour of temptation. Christians should be careful that charity not only reigns in their hearts, but shines in their lives. There is a great difference between Christian firmness and feverish warmth and transport. The apostle gave particular directions as to some who served the cause of Christ among them. Those who serve the saints, those who desire the honour of the churches, and to remove reproaches from them, are to be thought much of, and loved. They should willingly acknowledge the worth of such, and all who laboured with or helped the apostle.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Let all your things ... - All that you do. This direction is repeated on account of its great importance, and because it is a summing up of all that he had said in this Epistle; see <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-1.htm">1 Corinthians 13:1-13</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/14-1.htm">1 Corinthians 14:1</a>. Here he says, that charity, or love, was to regulate all that they did. This was a simple rule; and if this was observed, every thing would be done well. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. He shows that they ought to make their hopes of salvation to depend not on Apollos or any other teacher; that it rests with themselves. "Watch ye": for ye are slumbering. "Stand": for ye are like men tottering. "Quit you like men; be strong": for ye are effeminate (1Co 16:14). "Let all your things be done with charity" (1Co 8:1; 13:1): not with strifes as at present [Chrysostom].

Signifying, that the whole of their obedience to Christ, their observation of, and subjection to all his ordinances and commands, should spring from, and be done in love to him; and that the whole of their conduct and behaviour towards one another ought to be with charity, which bears all things, and covers a multitude of sins; and that all their church affairs, their business at church meetings, should be transacted, not with strife and vain glory, but in peace, and with mutual affection, with a concern for the good of each other, and of the whole body, and for the glory of God; for without charity or love, and the exercise of this grace, it signifies little what men either have or do; and such an exhortation was the more necessary to this church, since it was so full of factions, contentions, and divisions. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_corinthians/16.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Let all your things be done with charity.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/1_corinthians/16.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">14</span>. <span class="ital">Let all your things be done with charily</span>] i.e. <span class="ital">let everything you do</span> (literally <span class="bld">everything of yours</span>) <span class="ital">be done in love</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/1_corinthians/16.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/1_corinthians/16-14.htm" title="Let all your things be done with charity.">1 Corinthians 16:14</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἐν ἀγάπῃ</span>, <span class="ital">in love</span>) <a href="/1_corinthians/8-1.htm" title="Now as touching things offered to idols, we know that we all have knowledge.
