He should be fixed in the faith of the gospel, and never desert or give it up. By this faith alone he will be able to keep his ground in an hour of temptation. Christians should be careful that charity not only reigns in their hearts, but shines in their lives. There is a great difference between Christian firmness and feverish warmth and transport. The apostle gave particular directions as to some who served the cause of Christ among them. Those who serve the saints, those who desire the honour of the churches, and to remove reproaches from them, are to be thought much of, and loved. They should willingly acknowledge the worth of such, and all who laboured with or helped the apostle.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I am glad of the coming - That is, I am glad that they have come to me at Ephesus. I rejoice that he who was converted by my ministry in Achaia, and who has so long shown himself to be a personal friend to me, and an aid in my work, came where Iam.<p>Stephanas - The same person evidently mentioned in the previous verses. Probably he, as one of the oldest and most respected members of the church, had been selected to carry the letter of the <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1.htm">1 Corinthians 1</a> <a href="/1_corinthians/7-1.htm">1 Corinthians 7:1</a> to Paul, and to consult with him respecting the affairs of the church there.<p>Fortunatus and Achaieus - These persons are not referred to anywhere else in the New Testament. It appears that Fortunatus survived Paul, for he was subsequently the messenger of the church at Corinth to that at Rome, and bore back to the Corinthians the Epistle which Clement of Rome sent to them. See that epistle, Section 59.<p>For that which was lacking ... - The word which is used here, and rendered "that which was lacking" (&#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;  hustere&#772;ma), does not occur in the Classic writers. It means properly that which is missing, want, lack - Robinson. It may be used to denote a want or lack of any kind, whether of support, sustenance, aid, consolation, information, or counsel; see <a href="/luke/21-4.htm">Luke 21:4</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-30.htm">Philippians 2:30</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/3-10.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:10</a>. What this was which the Corinthians had neglected or failed to furnish Paul, and which had been supplied by the presence of these persons, can be only a matter of conjecture; and different commentators have supposed different things. It might be a neglect to provide for his needs, or a defect of informing him about their affairs in the letter which they had sent him; or it might be that these persons had furnished, by their presence and conversation, those consolations and friendly offices which the church at Corinth would have rendered had they been all present; and Paul may mean to say, that he had enjoyed with them that friendly contact and Christian communion which he had desired with them, but which was lacking, that is, which he had not been permitted to enjoy by reason of his absence. This is the view which is given by Rosenmuller, Doddridge, Bloomfield; and as Paul does not seem here inclined to blame them, this view is most in accordance with the general strain of the passage. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17.

They seem to have carried this letter back; see the subscription below: hence the exhortations, 1Co 16:16, 18, as though they would be at Corinth when the Epistle arrived.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_corinthians/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div>Ver. 17,18. It should seem that this church had sent these three persons to Paul at this time (as most think) at Ephesus, to acquaint him with the state of their churches; these men supplied the want of that whole church’s coming, or they made a report to the apostle of the Corinthians more fully than they had done in their letters. He adds, that they had <span class="ital">refreshed</span> his <span class="ital">spirit, </span> not with bringing him any money, (for the apostle hath told us, <span class="bld"><a href="/1_corinthians/9-15.htm" title="But I have used none of these things: neither have I written these things, that it should be so done to me: for it were better for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying void.">1 Corinthians 9:15</a></span>, that he gloried in this, that he had preached the gospel to them freely, without being any charge to them), but by their visit, and the conference that he had had with them about the state of that church. The apostle addeth, that they had refreshed their spirits also; intimating, that their joy was his, and that what was a refreshing to him, ought also to be so to them; he therefore recommendeth these men, and such as they were, to be reverenced and respected by this church. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_corinthians/16.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>I am glad of the coming of Stephanas, and Fortunatus, and Achaicus,.... Who very probably were those of the household of Chloe, mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-11.htm">1 Corinthians 1:11</a>, who came either of their own accord, or were sent as messengers from the church at Corinth to the apostle; who was glad to see them, one of them being baptized by him, and perhaps all of them converted under his ministry: however, they were believers in Christ, if not ministers of the Gospel, which seems very probable. <p>For that which was lacking on your part they have supplied; which is not to be understood of their supplying him with money, in which the Corinthians had been deficient; for as he had never taken anything of them, he was determined he never would; see <a href="/2_corinthians/11-7.htm">2 Corinthians 11:7</a>; but either of their presence which supplied the want of theirs, the apostle had been for some time greatly desirous of; or whereas they had been greatly wanting in sending him an account of the state of the church, and how things stood with them, these brethren greatly supplied that defect, by giving him a very particular account of their church affairs. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_corinthians/16.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/1_corinthians/16.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/context/1_corinthians/16-17.htm" title="I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied....">1 Corinthians 16:17-18</a>. Regarding <span class="ital">Fortunatus</span> (probably not different from the person named in Clem. 1 Cor. 59) and <span class="ital">Achaicus</span> no particulars are known. They are not to be included (as de Wette would have it) in the family of Stephanas, which has been spoken of already. Grotius holds them to be Chloe’s people; but see on <a href="/1_corinthians/1-11.htm" title="For it has been declared to me of you, my brothers, by them which are of the house of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.">1 Corinthians 1:11</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὅτι τὸ ὑμέτερον ὑστέρημα αὐτοὶ ἀνεπλ</span>.] <span class="ital">because they for their part have supplied your lack</span> (your absence).

Observe how <span class="ital">courteously</span> the expression: <span class="ital">the want of you</span> (of your presence), is chosen. Hofmann, on the contrary, misses this delicate touch by taking it as: what was lacking <span class="ital">in you</span>, in this respect, namely, that you could not appear with me in person. With still less delicacy Grotius, who adduces in his support <a href="/2_corinthians/9-12.htm" title="For the administration of this service not only supplies the want of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings to God;">2 Corinthians 9:12</a> : “<span class="ital">quod vos omnes facere oportuit, id illi fecerunt</span>; certiorem me fecere de vestris morbis.” He is followed by Rückert, who founds wrongly upon <a href="/philippians/2-30.htm" title="Because for the work of Christ he was near to death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me.">Php 2:30</a> : “<span class="ital">what should have been done by you, that have they done</span>,” inasmuch, namely, as they had given him joy, which had not been done by the Corinthians. But we must not decide here by passages from other Epistles, since linguistically both renderings alike may be correct, but simply by the connection, according to which the men as <span class="ital">ambassadors</span> from the Corinthians were the compensation to the apostle for the lack of the presence of the latter. Comp. Chrysosto.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἀνέπαυσαν γὰρ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.] reason assigned for the preceding <span class="greekheb">τὸ ὑστέρημα αὐτ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἀνεπλ</span>.[110] Regarding the phrase, comp. <a href="/2_corinthians/7-13.htm" title="Therefore we were comforted in your comfort: yes, and exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all.">2 Corinthians 7:13</a>; <a href="/philemon/1-7.htm" title="For we have great joy and consolation in your love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by you, brother.">Philemon 1:7</a>; <a href="/philemon/1-20.htm" title="Yes, brother, let me have joy of you in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.">Philemon 1:20</a>.<span class="bld"><span class="ital"><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ΚΑῚ ΤῸ ὙΜῶΝ</span></span></span>] for they have refreshed (by their arrival here, and the communications and assurances connected therewith, comp. <a href="/2_corinthians/7-13.htm" title="Therefore we were comforted in your comfort: yes, and exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all.">2 Corinthians 7:13</a>) my spirit <span class="ital">and yours</span>. The latter, inasmuch as they had come not in their own name, but as <span class="ital">representatives of the whole church</span>; their meeting therefore with Paul could not but be refreshing to the consciousness of the whole church. As they by their presence provided for <span class="ital">Paul</span> the joy of <span class="greekheb">ἀνάπαυσις</span>, so they provided it also for the <span class="ital">church</span>, which through them had entered into this fellowship with the apostle, and thus owed to them the refreshment which it could not but experience in the consciousness of this living intercourse of love with Paul brought about through these men. Comp. Chrysostom: <span class="greekheb">οὐ Παύλῳ μόνον</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀλλὰ καὶ ἐκείνοις αὐτοὺς χαρισαμένους δείκνυσι τῷ τὴν πόλιν ἅπασαν ἐν αὐτοῖς περιφέρειν</span>. Paul thus expresses not simply <span class="ital">reciprocity</span> in general,—that which is <span class="ital">presupposed where there is good-will</span> (de Wette),—but the relation implied in the <span class="ital">representation</span> of the church by their delegates,—a relation, therefore, which for the latter, in virtue of their acceptance of the embassage, was one of <span class="ital">merit</span>. There lies here, also, in the addition of this second pronoun, a tender delicacy (comp. on <a href="/1_corinthians/1-2.htm" title="To the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all that in every place call on the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and our's:">1 Corinthians 1:2</a>), which the readers acquainted with the manner of the apostle could well appreciate. Grotius makes the reference to be to the assurances of Paul’s love which those men had brought with them to the Corinthians. But <span class="greekheb">τὸ ὑμῶν</span> also, like <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤῸ ἘΜῸΝ ΠΝΕῦΜΑ</span></span></span>, must refer to the time of the presence of the delegates with Pau.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΠΙΓΙΝΏΣΚΕΤΕ</span></span></span>] Attention to the compound verb: <span class="ital">recognise them rightly</span> (comp. on <a href="/1_corinthians/13-12.htm" title="For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.">1 Corinthians 13:12</a>), should of itself have sufficed to prevent alterations of the sense of the word (such as: <span class="ital">prize them highly</span>, so Theophylact, Grotius, Flatt, Neander, and others).

On <span class="ital">Stephanas</span>, see <a href="/1_corinthians/1-16.htm" title="And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other.">1 Corinthians 1:16</a>. The two latter names are also <span class="ital">h.ll</span>. in N.T.; a <span class="ital">Fortunatus</span> appears in Clement’s list of emissaries from Rom. to Cor[2687] (<span class="ital">ad Cor</span>. § 65). Ed[2688] supposes all three to be <span class="ital">slaves</span> (<span class="ital">Achaïcus</span>, at least, resembles a slave-name), and identifies them with <span class="greekheb">οἱ τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Χλοῆς</span> of <a href="/1_corinthians/1-11.htm" title="For it has been declared to me of you, my brothers, by them which are of the house of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.">1 Corinthians 1:11</a>; but this does not comport with the position given to Stephanas in <a href="/1_corinthians/16-15.htm" title="I beseech you, brothers, (you know the house of Stephanas, that it is the first fruits of Achaia, and that they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints,)">1 Corinthians 16:15</a> f.; see, further, note on <a href="/1_corinthians/1-11.htm" title="For it has been declared to me of you, my brothers, by them which are of the house of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.">1 Corinthians 1:11</a>.

El[2691] and others read the poss. pron[2692] <span class="ital">subjectively</span>—“what you were lacking in (<span class="ital">i.e.</span>, your want of access) towards me”: this constr[2693] is consistent with the usage of <span class="greekheb">ὑστέρημα</span> (see parls.); but the former suits better the antithesis to <span class="greekheb">παρουσία</span> (Ed[2694]), and Paul’s fine courtesy.—“For they refreshed my spirit—and yours.” <span class="greekheb">ἀναπαύω</span> (see parls.) describes the restful effect of friendly converse and sympathy.
