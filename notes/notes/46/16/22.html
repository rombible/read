Do they love the Lord Jesus? The word here used for love signifies not merely affectionate regard, but personal devotion.<p><span class= "bld">Let him be Anathema Maran-atha.</span>—Better <span class= "ital">Let him be Anathema. Maranatha.</span> There is no connection between these two words. <span class= "ital">Anathema</span> signifies “accursed.” The absence of love to Christ is condemnation. The word <span class= "ital">Maranatha</span> is a Syriac expression—“the Lord is at hand,” or “the Lord is come;” probably the former. The uncertainty of the moment when the Lord may come is the most solemn thought with which to remind them of the importance of being one with Christ. Stanley gives the following interesting Note:—“The name Maronite is sometimes explained by a tradition that the Jews in their expectation of the Messiah were constantly saying, <span class= "ital">Maran </span>(Lord). To which the Christians answered, <span class= "ital">Maranatha</span> (The Lord is come), why do you expect Him? Hence the name, ‘<span class= "ital">Maronite</span>’ is applied to the Jews, especially Spanish Jews and Moors who confessed <span class= "ital">Maran,</span> but not <span class= "ital">Maranatha.”</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_corinthians/16.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/1_corinthians/16-22.htm" title="If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha.">1 Corinthians 16:22</a></span>. <span class="ital">If any man love not the Lord Jesus — </span>In sincerity, but is secretly alienated from him in heart, while he calls himself his servant, preferring some secular interest of his own to that of his Divine Master; if any one be an enemy to Christ’s person, offices, doctrines, or commands; <span class="ital">let him be Anathema Maranatha — Anathema </span>signifies a thing devoted to destruction, and it seems to have been customary with the Jews of that age, when they had pronounced any man anathema, to add the Syriac expression, <span class="ital">Maranatha, </span>that is, <span class="ital">the Lord cometh; </span>namely, to execute vengeance upon him. See note on <a href="/romans/9-3.htm" title="For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brothers, my kinsmen according to the flesh:">Romans 9:3</a>. We may add further here, <span class="ital">“Anathema Maranatha, </span>were the words with which the Jews began their greatest excommunications, whereby they not only excluded sinners from their society, but delivered them to the divine <span class="ital">Cherem, </span>or <span class="ital">Anathema; </span>that is, to eternal perdition. This form they used, because Enoch’s prophecy concerning the coming of God to judge and punish the wicked, began with these words, as we learn from Jude, who quotes the first sentence of that prophecy, <a href="/1_corinthians/16-14.htm" title="Let all your things be done with charity.">1 Corinthians 16:14</a>. Wherefore, since the apostle denounced this curse against the man, who, while he professed subjection to Christ, was secretly alienated from him in his heart, it is as if he had said, Though such a person’s wickedness cannot be discovered and punished by the church, yet the Lord, at his coming, will find it out, and punish him with eternal perdition. This terrible curse the apostle wrote in his epistle to the Corinthians, because many of the faction, but especially their leader, had shown great alienation of mind from Christ. And he wrote it <span class="ital">with his own hand, </span>to show how serious he was in the denunciation;” and he inserted it between his salutation and solemn benediction, that it might be the more attentively regarded. “Estius says, from his example, and from the anathemas pronounced <a href="/context/galatians/1-8.htm" title="But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel to you than that which we have preached to you, let him be accursed....">Galatians 1:8-9</a>, arose the practice of the ancient general councils, of adding to their decisions, or definitions of doctrine, <span class="ital">anathemas </span>against them who denied these doctrines.” Be this as it may, let it ever be remembered that professing Christians, who do not sincerely love their Master, lie under the heaviest curse which an apostle could pronounce, or God inflict. Let the unhappy creatures take the alarm, and labour to obtain a more ingenuous temper, ere the Lord, whom they neglect, and against whom they entertain a secret enmity, descend from heaven with unsupportable terror, and pronounce the <span class="ital">anathema </span>with his own lips, in circumstances which shall for ever cut off all hope, and all possibility of its being reversed! See Macknight and Doddridge.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/16.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>16:19-24 Christianity by no means destroys civility. Religion should promote a courteous and obliging temper towards all. Those give a false idea of religion, and reproach it, who would take encouragement from it to be sour and morose. And Christian salutations are not mere empty compliments; but are real expressions of good-will to others, and commend them to the Divine grace and blessing. Every Christian family should be as a Christian church. Wherever two or three are gathered together in the name of Christ, and he is among them, there is a church. Here is a solemn warning. Many who have Christ's name much in their mouths, have no true love to him in their hearts. None love him in truth, who do not love his laws, and keep his commandments. Many are Christians in name, who do not love Christ Jesus the Lord in sincerity. Such are separated from the people of God, and the favour of God. Those who love not the Lord Jesus Christ, must perish without remedy. Let us not rest in any religious profession where there is not the love of Christ, earnest desires for his salvation, gratitude for his mercies, and obedience to his commandments. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ has in it all that is good, for time and for eternity. To wish that our friends may have this grace with them, is wishing them the utmost good. And this we should wish all our friends and brethren in Christ. We can wish them nothing greater, and we should wish them nothing less. True Christianity makes us wish those whom we love, the blessings of both worlds; this is meant in wishing the grace of Christ to be with them. The apostle had dealt plainly with the Corinthians, and told them of their faults with just severity; but he parts in love, and with a solemn profession of his love to them for Christ's sake. May our love be with all who are in Christ Jesus. Let us try whether all things appear worthless to us, when compared with Christ and his righteousness. Do we allow ourselves in any known sin, or in the neglect of any known duty? By such inquiries, faithfully made, we may judge of the state of our souls.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ - This is a most solemn and affecting close of the whole epistle. It was designed to direct them to the great and essential matter of religion, the love of the Lord Jesus; and was intended, doubtless, to turn away their minds from the subjects which had agitated them, the disputes and dissensions which had rent the church into factions, to the great inquiry whether they truly loved the Saviour. It is implied that there was danger, in their disputes and strifes about minor matters, of neglecting the love of the Lord Jesus, or of substituting attachment to a party in the place of that love to the Saviour which alone could be connected with eternal life.<p>Let him be anathema - On the meaning of the word anathema, see the note at <a href="/1_corinthians/12-3.htm">1 Corinthians 12:3</a>. The word properly means accursed, or devoted to destruction; and the idea here is, that he who did not believe in the Lord Jesus, and love him, would be, and ought to be, devoted to destruction, or accursed of God. It expresses what ought to be done; it expresses a truth in regard to God's dealings, not the desire of the apostle. No matter what any man's endowments might be; no matter what might be his wealth, his standing, or his talent; no matter if he were regarded as a ruler in the church, or at the head of a party; yet if he had not true love to the Lord Jesus, he could not be saved. This sentiment is in accordance with the declaration of the Scripture everywhere. See particularly, <a href="/john/3-31.htm">John 3:31</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/6-16.htm">Micah 6:16</a>, and the note on the latter place.<p>Maran-atha - These are Syriac words, Moran Etho - "the Lord comes;" that is, will come. The reason why this expression is added may be:<p>(1) To give the greater solemnity to the declaration of the apostle; that is, to give it an emphatic form.<p>(2) to intimate that, though there were no earthly power to punish a lack of love to the Saviour; though the state could not, and ought not to punish it; and though the church could not exclude all who did not love the Lord Jesus from its bosom, yet they could not escape. For, the Lord would himself come to take vengeance on his enemies; and no one could escape. Though, therefore, those who did not love the Lord Jesus could not be punished by people, yet they could not escape divine condemnation. The Lord would come to execute vengeance himself, and they could not escape. It is probable (see Lightfoot in loco) that the Jews were accustomed to use such a form in their greater excommunication, and that they meant by it, that the person who was thus devoted to destruction, and excommunicated, must be destroyed; for the Lord would come to take vengeance on all his enemies. "It certainly was not now, for the first time, used as a new kind of cursing by the apostle; but was the application of a current mode of speech to the purpose he had in contemplation. Perhaps, therefore, by inspecting the manners of the East, we may illustrate the import of this singular passage. The nearest approach to it that I have been able to discover is in the following extract from Mr. Bruce; and though, perhaps, this does not come up to the full power of the apostle's meaning, yet, probably, it gives the idea which was commonly attached to the phrase among the public. Mr. Bruce had been forced by a pretended saint, in Egypt, to take him on board his vessel, as if to carry him to a certain place - whereas, Mr. Bruce meant no such thing; but, having set him on shore at some little distance from whence he came, 'we slacked our vessel down the stream a few yards, filling our sails, and stretching away.<p>On seeing this, our saint fell into a desperate passion, cursing, blaspheming, and stamping with his feet; at every word crying "Shar Ullah!" that is, "May God send and do justice!" This appears to be the strongest execration this passionate Arab could use, that is, To punish you adequately is out of my power: I remit you to the vengeance of God.' Is not this the import of anathema maranatha?" - Taylor in Calmet. This solemn declaration, or denunciation, the apostle wrote with his own hand, as the summary of all that he had said, in order that it might be attentively regarded. There is not a more solemn declaration in the Bible; there is not a more fearful denunciation; there is no one that will be more certainly executed. No matter what we may have - be it wealth, or beauty, or vigor, or accomplishment, or adorning, or the praise and flattery of the world; no matter if we are elevated high in office and in rank; no matter if we are honored by the present age, or gain a reputation to be transmitted to future times; yet if we have not love to the Saviour, we cannot be saved.<p>We must be devoted to the curse; and the Lord Jesus will soon return to execute the tremendous sentence on a guilty world. How important then to ask whether we have that love? Whether we are attached to the Lord Jesus in such a manner as to secure his approbation? Whether we so love him as to be prepared to hail his coming with joy, and to be received into his everlasting kingdom - In the close of the notes on this Epistle, I may ask anyone who shall read these pages whether he has this love? And I may press it upon the attention of each one, though I may never see their faces in the flesh, as the great inquiry which is to determine their everlasting destiny. The solemn declaration stands here, that if they do not love the Lord Jesus, they will be, and they ought to be, devoted to destruction. The Lord Jesus will soon return to make investigation, and to judge the world. There will be no escape; and no tongue can express the awful horrors of an eternal curse pronounced by the lips of the Son of God! <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22.

Let the Jews and other vain persons say what they will, the Lord is come; and if any love him not, let him be looked on as a detestable person. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_corinthians/16.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ,.... The Vulgate Latin, and the Syriac and Ethiopic versions, read "our Lord". The apostle here does not so much mean profane and unregenerate sinners, who are destitute of love to Christ, from ignorance of him; nor such who, from the same principle, might persecute him in his members, for such are to be even prayed for, and wished well unto; and oftentimes such are called by grace, and become true and sincere lovers of Christ; and the apostle himself was an instance of it: some think the Jews are intended, who were the mortal enemies of Christ; hated his name and person, his Gospel and interest, and maliciously persecuted the same; they called Jesus accursed, and therefore deserved an anathema to be pronounced on them; it was prophesied of them, that their name should be left for a curse; and it was threatened to them, in case of non-repentance, upon the coming of John the Baptist, in the spirit of Elijah, that the Lord would come and smite their land with a curse; which had its accomplishment in the destruction of Jerusalem; see <a href="/isaiah/65-15.htm">Isaiah 65:15</a>; others think the Gnostics are intended, one of whose tenets was, that it was lawful not to confess Christ in a time of persecution, in order to save themselves; and such might be truly said not to love our Lord Jesus, and on whom such an anathema as after mentioned might rightly be denounced: though it should seem rather, that some persons in this church, or that infested it, are referred to as the false teachers, and those who sided with them, who made factions and divisions in the church of Christ; allowed themselves in the commission of fornication and incest, and such like impurities; had no regard to the peace of the consciences of weak brethren, but laid stumblingblocks in their way; behaved in a very irreverent manner at the Lord's table, and gave in to very pernicious errors and heresies, particularly denying the resurrection of the dead; and by their many bad principles and practices plainly showed that they did not in deed and in truth love our Lord Jesus: wherefore of every such an one the apostle says, <p>let him be anathema. The word anathema, answers to the Hebrew  and is rendered by it here in the Syriac version; and signifies anything separated and devoted to holy uses; and so it is used by the Septuagint, in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/27-28.htm">Leviticus 27:28</a>, and in the New Testament, <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/21-5.htm">Luke 21:5</a>, and which, if alienated to any other purposes, entailed a curse on persons; hence it is often translated "accursed", as <a href="/romans/9-3.htm">Romans 9:3</a> <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-3.htm">1 Corinthians 12:3</a>, and here it signifies, that such persons that love not the Lord Jesus, should be rejected by the saints, and separated from their communion; and so the Arabic version renders it, "let him be separated"; that is, from the church; let him be cast out of it, and cut off from it; as, so living and dying without love to Christ, he will be accursed by him at the last day, and will have that awful sentence denounced on him, "go ye cursed". The apostle adds another word, about which there is some difficulty, <p>maranatha; some make this to be the same with "anathema"; the one being the Syriac, the other the Greek word, as "Abba, Father"; and think that "maranatha" is put for  "maharamatha"; others think that it is the same with  "maharonatha", which signifies "from wrath to come"; and being joined with the other word, intends an anathematizing or devoting persons to wrath to come: others take it to be the last, and worse sort of excommunication among the Jews; and observe, that the first sort was called  "Niddui", which was a separation from company and conversation, to which reference may be had in <a href="/luke/6-22.htm">Luke 6:22</a>; the second sort was called Cherem, to which "anathema" answers, and was a separation, attended with curses and imprecations; and a third sort was called  "Shammatha", and is thought to answer to "maranatha", giving the etymology of it, as if it was, , "the name", i.e. "God cometh", as "maranatha" read as two words, signify "our Lord cometh": but this is not the etymology the Jews give of "Shammatha" (g); they ask, <p>"what is "Shammatha?" says Rab, , "there is death"; and Samuel says, , "desolations shall be";'' <p>but of the other etymology there is no mention made among them; nor is ever the word "maranatha" used by them for excommunication; the sense of which certainly is, "our Lord cometh"; and the Ethiopic version, joining it with the former word, renders the whole thus, "let him be anathema in the coming of our Lord", which seems to be pretty much the sense of the apostle: it is best to consider this word, or rather these two words, "maran atha", "our Lord cometh", as added by the apostle, to put persons in mind of the coming of Christ; either at the destruction of Jerusalem, to take vengeance on the Jews, who did not love, but hated him, and maliciously persecuted him, and his; or of the second coming of Christ to judgment, when all the wicked of the earth shall be accursed by him, and all such that love him not will be bid to depart from him. <p>(g) T.

It is the word used when our Lord for the third time asks St Peter the question ‘Lovest thou me?’ (St <a href="/john/21-17.htm" title="He said to him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, love you me?

Christians are to cultivate a feeling of personal loyalty and affection for Jesus Christ, such as a soldier feels for his general, or a disciple for his master.

As the natural precedes the spiritual (ch. <a href="/1_corinthians/15-46.htm" title="However, that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.">1 Corinthians 15:46</a>), so the love for Christ as Man must precede, and lead up to, the love for Him as God.

Lightfoot cites <a href="/malachi/4-6.htm" title="And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.">Malachi 4:6</a>, the last words of the last prophet, ‘Lest I <span class="ital">come</span> and smite the earth with <span class="ital">a curse</span>’ (<span class="ital">cherem</span>). It is difficult to account for the Aramaic form of the word, unless we suppose with some that the utterance of the formula in the Apostle’s own language was likely to be more impressive. For this and the foregoing word consult Smith’s <span class="ital">Dictionary of the Bible</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/1_corinthians/16.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/1_corinthians/16-22.htm" title="If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha.">1 Corinthians 16:22</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἔι τις οὐ</span>, <span class="ital">if any man not</span>) Paul loves Jesus, do ye also all love Him.—<span class="greekheb">φιλεῖ</span>) <span class="ital">loves</span> with the heart: kisses virtually by his conduct: the corresponding word to <span class="greekheb">φιλεῖ</span> is <span class="greekheb">φιλήματι</span>, <span class="ital">with a kiss</span>, <a href="/1_corinthians/16-20.htm" title="All the brothers greet you.

The words Maranatha add weight to the anathema; and this phrase, expressed in an idiom familiar to the Jews indicates, that he who loves not Jesus will partake with the Jews, who call Jesus anathema with bitter hatred, <a href="/1_corinthians/12-3.htm" title="Why I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calls Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.">1 Corinthians 12:3</a>, in that curse most righteously falling upon themselves, for he uses this language to soften the odiousness of the phrase [by Euphemism] instead of the expression, if any man hate Jesus. <span class="greekheb">Μαρὰν ἀθὰ</span>, <span class="ital">i.e. the Lord cometh;</span> <span class="greekheb">μαρὰν</span> in Syriac, <span class="ital">our Lord</span>, or simply <span class="ital">the Lord</span>.

As in French <span class="ital">monseigneur</span> is the same as <span class="ital">seigneur.</span>, <span class="greekheb">Μαρὰν ἀθὰ</span> seems to have been a frequent symbol [watchword] with Paul, the meaning of which the Corinthians had either already known, or now, when they were to be seriously affected by it, might learn from others.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If any man love not,</span> etc. This sentence (as in <a href="/colossians/4-18.htm">Colossians 4:18</a>; <a href="/ephesians/6-24.htm">Ephesians 6:24</a>) is part of the autograph salutation. The verb here used for "love" (<span class="accented">philo</span>) was perhaps suggested by the word for "kiss" (<span class="accented">philema</span>). The word generally used for "love of God" is <span class="accented">agapae</span> (<a href="/ephesians/6-24.htm">Ephesians 6:24</a>), which implies less warmth, but deeper reverence. But this passage is full of emotion. <span class="cmt_word">Let him be Anathema.</span> The word only occurs elsewhere in 1 Corinthians 12:3; <a href="/acts/23-13.htm">Acts 23:13</a>; <a href="/romans/9-3.htm">Romans 9:3</a>; <a href="/galatians/1-8.htm">Galatians 1:8, 9</a> (comp. <a href="/matthew/26-74.htm">Matthew 26:74</a>, "to curse"). It is the equivalent of the Hebrew <span class="accented">cherem</span>, a ban (<a href="/leviticus/27-29.htm">Leviticus 27:29</a>; <a href="/joshua/6-17.htm">Joshua 6:17</a>, etc.). I cannot pretend to understand what St. Paul means by it, unless it be "Let personal love to Christ be the <span class="accented">essential</span> of Christian fellowship, and let him who has it not be regarded <span class="accented">as</span> <span class="accented">apart from the Church."</span> Commentators call it "an imprecation," or "malediction," and say that it means "Let him be devoted to God's wrath and judgment." That language is, indeed, very like the language of religious hatred and religious usurpation in all ages, but it is the very antithesis to the general tone of the apostle. <span class="accented">If</span> this were the meaning, it would seem to resemble the very spirit which Christ himself severely rebuked as the Elijah spirit, not the Christ spirit. But I do not believe that, even in a passing outburst of strong emotion, St. Paul had any such meaning. For <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the Jews used <span class="accented">cherem</span>, not only of the severer form of excommunication (<span class="accented">shem atha</span>), but even of the milder and by no means severe <span class="accented">temporary</span> form (<span class="accented">nidui</span>); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> it cannot be <span class="accented">more</span> severe than "handing over to Satan" (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-5.htm">1 Corinthians 5:5</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/1-20.htm">1 Timothy 1:20</a>), which was merciful in its purpose. <span class="cmt_word">Maran-atha;</span> two words, <span class="accented">the Lord cometh</span>; like the Jewish <span class="accented">shem atha</span>, "the Name cometh," or, "the Lord comes."

Rev., properly, a period after anathema. Maranatha means the Lord cometh. It was a reminder of the second coming. The reason for the use of the Aramaic phrase is unknown.
