There is in the original a characteristic play upon words here which can scarcely be rendered adequately in the English: “Ye know the house of Stephanas, that they have <span class= "ital">ordered themselves</span> to the ministry of the saints, now I exhort you, <span class= "ital">order yourselves</span> to be subject to them.” Stephanas (<a href="/context/1_corinthians/16-1.htm" title="Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do you.">1Corinthians 16:1-16</a>), Fortunatus, and Achaicus had come from Corinth to Ephesus, probably with the letter from the Corinthians (<a href="/1_corinthians/8-1.htm" title="Now as touching things offered to idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but charity edifies.">1Corinthians 8:1</a>), and their presence had cheered the Apostle. They, “faithful amid the faithless,” had made up for the want of zeal and love on the part of so many of the Corinthians. The Corinthians might think that these men had told St. Paul much of the evil state of Corinth, and he, therefore, carefully commends them to their consideration as having refreshed, not only his spirit, but “theirs also.” They had come on behalf of the whole Church there, not enemies to bear tales, but well-wishing friends to obtain apostolic help and counsel for all. The Apostle did not send his reply back by the same messengers, but by Titus instead, as probably their return to Corinth would have stirred up a good deal of controversy and ill feeling as to what account they had given him verbally of the various parties and their conduct in Corinth.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_corinthians/16.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/1_corinthians/16-15.htm" title="I beseech you, brothers, (you know the house of Stephanas, that it is the first fruits of Achaia, and that they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints,)...">1 Corinthians 16:15-16</a></span>. <span class="ital">Ye know the house, </span>or family, <span class="ital">of Stephanas, that it is the first-fruits of Achaia </span>— That he and they were the first converts in that province; <span class="ital">and that they have addicted themselves </span>— According to the rank in which Providence has placed them, and the abilities which God hath given them; <span class="ital">to the ministry of the saints </span>— To the supplying of their temporal and spiritual wants, both in promoting the progress of the gospel, and succouring the afflicted. <span class="ital">That ye also </span>— In your turn; <span class="ital">submit yourselves to </span>the admonitions of <span class="ital">such; </span>so repaying their free service. <span class="ital">And to every one that helpeth with us, and laboureth </span>— That labours in the gospel, either with or without a fellow-labourer.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/16.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>16:13-18 A Christian is always in danger, therefore should ever be on the watch.

Christians should be careful that charity not only reigns in their hearts, but shines in their lives. There is a great difference between Christian firmness and feverish warmth and transport. The apostle gave particular directions as to some who served the cause of Christ among them. Those who serve the saints, those who desire the honour of the churches, and to remove reproaches from them, are to be thought much of, and loved. They should willingly acknowledge the worth of such, and all who laboured with or helped the apostle.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I beseech you, brethren - The construction here is somewhat involved, but the sense is plain.

These persons did not constitute a body of Church officers; we find no traces as yet of an official order in the church of Cor[2682]: the Ap. enjoins spontaneous submission to the direction of those able and disposed to lead in good works. The prp[2683] in <span class="greekheb">συν</span>-<span class="greekheb">εργοῦντι</span> refers not to St. specifically, still less to P., but generally to <span class="ital">co-operative</span> labour in the Church, while <span class="greekheb">κοπιῶντι</span> implies labour carried to the point of <span class="ital">toil</span> or <span class="ital">suffering</span> (see note on <span class="greekheb">κόπος</span>, <a href="/1_corinthians/3-8.htm" title="Now he that plants and he that waters are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labor.">1 Corinthians 3:8</a>; also <a href="/1_corinthians/15-58.htm" title="Therefore, my beloved brothers, be you steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, for as much as you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.">1 Corinthians 15:58</a>).
