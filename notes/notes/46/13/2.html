He therefore naturally selects it as coming into the same condemnation, if unaccompanied by love. All the secrets of God’s providence and complete knowledge (see <a href="/1_corinthians/12-8.htm" title="For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;">1Corinthians 12:8</a>), even such a transcendent faith as Christ had spoken of as capable of moving mountains (<a href="/matthew/17-20.htm" title="And Jesus said to them, Because of your unbelief: for truly I say to you, If you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you shall say to this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible to you.">Matthew 17:20</a>), may belong to a man, and without love he is nothing.

Without this, the most glorious gifts are of no account to us, of no esteem in the sight of God. A clear head and a deep understanding, are of no value without a benevolent and charitable heart. There may be an open and lavish hand, where there is not a liberal and charitable heart. Doing good to others will do none to us, if it be not done from love to God, and good-will to men. If we give away all we have, while we withhold the heart from God, it will not profit. Nor even the most painful sufferings. How are those deluded who look for acceptance and reward for their good works, which are as scanty and defective as they are corrupt and selfish!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And though I have the gift of prophecy - See the note at <a href="/1_corinthians/12-10.htm">1 Corinthians 12:10</a>; note at <a href="/1_corinthians/14-1.htm">1 Corinthians 14:1</a>.<p>And understand all mysteries - On the meaning of the word "mystery" see note, <a href="/1_corinthians/2-7.htm">1 Corinthians 2:7</a>. This passage proves that it was one part of the prophetic office, as referred to here, to be able to understand and explain the "mysteries" of religion; that is, the things that were before unknown, or unrevealed. It does not refer to the prediction of future events, but to the great and deep truths connected with religion; the things that were unexplained in the old economy, the meaning of types and emblems; and the obscure portions of the plan of redemption. All these might be plain enough if they were revealed; but there were many things connected with religion which God had not chosen to reveal to people.<p>And all knowledge - See the note at <a href="/1_corinthians/12-8.htm">1 Corinthians 12:8</a>. Though I knew every thing. Though I were acquainted fully with all the doctrines of religion; and were with all sciences and arts.<p>And though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains - Thould I should have the highest kind of faith. This is referred to by the Saviour <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/17-20.htm">Matthew 17:20</a>, as the highest kind of faith; and Paul here had this fact doubtless in his eye.<p>I am nothing - All would be of no value. it would not save me. I should still be an unredeemed, unpardoned sinner. I should do good to no one; I should answer none of the great purposes which God has designed; I should not by all this secure my salvation. All would be in vain in regard to the great purpose of my existence. None of these things could be placed before God as a ground of acceptance in the Day of Judgment. Unless I should have love, I should still be lost. A somewhat similar idea is expressed by the Saviour, in regard to the Day of Judgment, in <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/7-22.htm">Matthew 7:22-23</a>, "Many will say unto me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?

The practical power of the will elevated by faith [Neander]; confidence in God that the miraculous result will surely follow the exercise of the will at the secret impulse of His Spirit. Without "love" prophecy, knowledge, and faith, are not what they seem (compare 1Co 8:1, 2; Mt 7:22; Jas 2:14; compare 1Co 13:8), and so fail of the heavenly reward (Mt 6:2). Thus Paul, who teaches justification by faith only (Ro 3:4, 5; Ga 2:16; 3:7-14), is shown to agree with James, who teaches (Jas 2:24) "by works" (that is, by LOVE, which is the "spirit" of faith, Jas 2:26) a man is justified, "and not by faith only."<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_corinthians/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">And though I have the gift of prophecy:</span> it hath been before showed, that <span class="ital">the gift of prophecy, </span> signifieth an extraordinary power or faculty, by which men in those primitive times were enabled to reveal the mind and will of God, either as to future contingencies, or things which should afterwards come to pass in the world, or by further explication or application of the mind and will of God already revealed in holy writ. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And understand all mysteries, and all knowledge:</span> though, saith the apostle, I have a vast knowledge, and could in any notion comprehend the most sublime and hidden things, whether Divine or human. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And though I have all faith</span> (except that which is saving and justifying). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">So that I could remove mountains:</span> he further opens what faith he meant, viz. faith of miracles, a firm persuasion that God would upon my prayer work things beyond the power, and contrary to the course, of nature: the apostle alludeth to the words of our Saviour, <span class="bld"><a href="/matthew/17-20.htm" title="And Jesus said to them, Because of your unbelief: for truly I say to you, If you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you shall say to this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible to you.">Matthew 17:20</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And have not charity, I am nothing; </span> yet, saith he, if I have not love, that true love to God and men, by which that faith which is profitable to salvation worketh and showeth itself, it will all signify nothing, be of no profit nor avail unto me in order to my eternal salvation; I may perish for ever, notwithstanding such gifts. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_corinthians/13.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And though I have the gift of prophecy,....

The Jews used to call their learned and profound doctors, such as could solve difficulties, and do wondrous things, by the name of mountains, or removers of mountains; thus (f). <p>"they called Rab Joseph, "Sinai", because he was very expert in the Talmudic doctrines, and Rabbah bar Nachmani, , "a rooter up of mountains"; because he was exceeding acute in subtle disputations.'' <p>Says Rabba (g) to his disciples, <p>"lo, I am ready to return an answer smartly to everyone that shall ask me, as Ben Azzai, who expounded in the streets of Tiberias; and there was not in his days such a , "rooter up of mountains", as he.'' <p>Again (h), <p>"Ula saw Resh Lekish in the school, as if , "he was rooting up the mountains", and grinding them together; says Rabenu, does not everybody see R.
