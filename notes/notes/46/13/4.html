Descriptions of positive characteristics and negations of evil qualities are now employed by the Apostle in what he would have us believe to be his impossible task of adequately describing true love.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_corinthians/13.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/1_corinthians/13-4.htm" title="Charity suffers long, and is kind; charity envies not; charity braggs not itself, is not puffed up,...">1 Corinthians 13:4-5</a></span>. <span class="ital">Love suffereth long </span>— Here the apostle attributes to love the qualities and actions of a person, in order to render his account of that divine grace the more lively and affecting. The love of God, and of our neighbour for God’s sake, is patient toward all men. It suffers all the weakness, ignorance, errors, and infirmities of the children of God; and all the malice and wickedness of the children of the world; and all this not only for a time, but to the end; and in every step toward overcoming evil with good, it <span class="ital">is kind </span>— Mild, gentle, benign; inspiring the sufferer at once with the most amiable sweetness, and the most fervent and tender affection. <span class="ital">Love envieth not </span>— The advantages, gifts, or graces, which others possess, but rather takes pleasure in them, and by friendly participation makes them its own. <span class="ital">Love vaunteth not itself </span>— Greek, <span class="greekheb">ου περπερευεται</span>, <span class="ital">acteth not rashly, </span>as the expression is translated by many critics, following Phavorinus. Indeed, to render it as our translators do, is to make it signify the same thing with the next clause. The lover of God and mankind does not hastily condemn any one; never passes a severe sentence on a slight or sudden view of things. Nor does he act or behave in a violent, headstrong, or precipitate manner. <span class="ital">Is not puffed up </span>— With pride or self-conceit on account of any endowments or qualifications, mental or corporal, natural or acquired, civil or religious. On the contrary, love to God, whereby we esteem him as the greatest and best of beings, desire him as our chief good, delight in him as our portion and treasure in time and in eternity, cannot but humble us in the dust before him, while we contrast our various weaknesses, imperfections, and sins, with his infinite excellences and matchless glories, and compare his superlative goodness with our great unworthiness. And the love of our neighbour, naturally leading us to dwell on his virtues, and overlook his defects, must also, though in a lower degree, produce the same effect, and cause us to prefer others to ourselves in a variety of respects. <span class="ital">Doth not behave itself unseemly — </span>Or <span class="ital">indecently, </span>as <span class="greekheb">ουκ ασχημονει </span>properly signifies; that is, it is not rude or willingly offensive to any one, but renders to all their dues, suitable to time, place, person, and all other circumstances. <span class="ital">Seeketh not her own </span>— Ease, pleasure, honour, or temporal advantage. Nay, sometimes the lover of God and of mankind <span class="ital">seeketh not, </span>in some sense, even his own spiritual advantage; does not think of himself, so long as a zeal for the glory of God and the souls of men swallows him up. But though he is all on fire for these ends, yet he <span class="ital">is not provoked, </span>(the word <span class="ital">easily </span>is not in the original,) to sharpness or unkindness toward any one. Outward provocations indeed will frequently occur, but he triumphs over them. <span class="ital">Thinketh no evil </span>— The loving man indeed cannot but see and hear evil things, and know that they are so; but he does not <span class="ital">willingly think evil </span>of any, neither <span class="ital">infer </span>evil where none appears. The love in his heart prevents his imagining that of which he has no proof, and casts out all jealousies, evil surmises, readiness to believe evil, and induces him to put the kindest constructions upon the actions of others, and on the principles from whence they proceed, which the nature of circumstances will by any means allow.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/13.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>13:4-7 Some of the effects of charity are stated, that we may know whether we have this grace; and that if we have not, we may not rest till we have it. This love is a clear proof of regeneration, and is a touchstone of our professed faith in Christ. In this beautiful description of the nature and effects of love, it is meant to show the Corinthians that their conduct had, in many respects, been a contrast to it. Charity is an utter enemy to selfishness; it does not desire or seek its own praise, or honour, or profit, or pleasure. Not that charity destroys all regard to ourselves, or that the charitable man should neglect himself and all his interests. But charity never seeks its own to the hurt of others, or to neglect others. It ever prefers the welfare of others to its private advantage. How good-natured and amiable is Christian charity! How excellent would Christianity appear to the world, if those who profess it were more under this Divine principle, and paid due regard to the command on which its blessed Author laid the chief stress! Let us ask whether this Divine love dwells in our hearts. Has this principle guided us into becoming behaviour to all men? Are we willing to lay aside selfish objects and aims? Here is a call to watchfulness, diligence, and prayer.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Charity suffereth long - Paul now proceeds to illustrate the "nature" of love, or to show how it is exemplified. His illustrations are all drawn from its effect in regulating our conduct toward others, or our contact with them. The "reason" why he made use of this illustration, rather than its nature as evinced toward "God," was, probably, because it was especially necessary for them to understand in what way it should be manifested toward each other. There were contentions and strifes among them; there were of course suspicions, and jealousies, and heart-burnings; there would be unkind judging, the imputation of improper motives, and selfishness; there were envy, and pride, and boasting, all of which were inconsistent with love; and Paul therefore evidently designed to correct these evils, and to produce a different state of things by showing them what would be produced by the exercise of love. The word used here &#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;  makrothumei denotes "longanimity," slowness to anger or passion; longsuffering, patient endurance, forbearance. It is opposed to haste; to passionate expressions and thoughts, and to irritability. It denotes the state of mind which can bear long when oppressed, provoked, calumniated, and when one seeks to injure us; compare <a href="/romans/2-4.htm">Romans 2:4</a>; <a href="/romans/9-22.htm">Romans 9:22</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/6-6.htm">2 Corinthians 6:6</a>; <a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-2.htm">Ephesians 4:2</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-12.htm">Colossians 3:12</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/1-16.htm">1 Timothy 1:16</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/3-10.htm">2 Timothy 3:10</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/4-2.htm">2 Timothy 4:2</a>; <a href="/1_peter/3-20.htm">1 Peter 3:20</a>; <a href="/2_peter/3-15.htm">2 Peter 3:15</a>.<p>And is kind - The word used here denotes to be good-natured, gentle, tender, affectionate. Love is benignant. It wishes well. It is not harsh, sour, morose, ill-natured. Tyndale renders it, "is courteous." The idea is, that under all provocations and ill-usage it is gentle and mild. "Hatred" prompts to harshness, severity, unkindness of expression, anger, and a desire of revenge. But love is the reverse of all these. A man who truly loves another will be kind to him, desirous of doing him good; will be "gentle," not severe and harsh; will be "courteous" because he desires his happiness, and would not pain his feelings. And as religion is love, and prompts to love, so it follows that it requires courtesy or true politeness, and will secure it; see <a href="/1_peter/3-8.htm">1 Peter 3:8</a>. If all people were under the influence of true religion, they would always be truly polite and courteous; for true politeness is nothing more than an expression of benignity, or a desire to promote the happiness of all around us.<p>Envieth not - &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787; &#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b9;  ou ze&#772;loi. This word properly means to be "zealous" for or against any person or thing; that is, to be eager for, or anxious for or against anyone. It is used often in a good sense (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-31.htm">1 Corinthians 12:31</a>; See the <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-1.htm">1 Corinthians 14:1</a>, <a href="/1_corinthians/14-39.htm">1 Corinthians 14:39</a> notes; <a href="/2_corinthians/11-2.htm">2 Corinthians 11:2</a> note, etc.); but it may be used in a bad sense - to be zealous "against" a person; to be jealous of; to envy. <a href="/acts/7-9.htm">Acts 7:9</a>; <a href="/acts/17-5.htm">Acts 17:5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/james/4-2.htm">James 4:2</a>, "ye kill and envy." It is in this sense, evidently, that it is used here, - as denoting zeal, or ardent desire "against" any person. The sense is, love does not envy others the happiness which they enjoy; it delights in their welfare; and as their happiness is increased by their endowments, their rank, their reputation, their wealth, their health, their domestic comforts, their learning etc., those who are influenced by love "rejoice" in all this. They would not diminish it; they would not embarrass them in the possession; they would not detract from that happiness; they would not complain or repine that they themselves are not so highly favored - To envy is to feel uneasiness, mortification, or discontent at the sight of superior happiness, excellence or reputation enjoyed by another; to repine at another's prosperity; and to fret oneself on account of his real or fancied superiority.<p>Of course, it may be excited by anything in which another excels, or in which he is more favored than we are. It may be excited by superior wealth, beauty, learning, accomplishment, reputation, success. It may extend to any employment, or any rank in life. A man may be envied because he is happy while we are miserable; well, while we are sick; caressed, while we are neglected or overlooked; successful, while we meet with disappointment; handsome, while we are ill-formed; honored with office, while we are overlooked. He may be envied because he has a better farm than we have, or is a more skillful mechanic, or a more successful physician, lawyer, or clergyman. "Envy commonly lies in the same line of business, occupation, or rank." We do not, usually envy a monarch, a conqueror, or a nobleman, unless we are "aspiring" to the same rank. The farmer does not usually envy the blacksmith, but another farmer; the blacksmith does not usually envy the schoolmaster, or the lawyer, but another man in the same line of business with himself.<p>The physician envies another physician more learned or more successful; the lawyer envies another lawyer; the clergyman is jealous of another clergyman. The fashionable female who seeks admiration or flattery on account of accomplishment or beauty envies another who is more distinguished and more successful in those things. And so the poet envies a rival poet and the orator, a rival orator; and the statesman, a rival statesman. The correction of all these things is "love." If we loved others; if we rejoiced in their happiness, we should not envy them. "They are not to blame" for these superior endowments; but if those endowments are the direct gift of God, we should he thankful that he has made others happy; if they are the fruit of their own industry, and virtue, and skill and application, we should esteem them the more, and value them the more highly. They have not injured us; and we should not be unhappy, or seek to injure them, because God has blessed them, or because they have been more industrious, virtuous, and successful than we have.<p>Every person should have his own level in society, and we should rejoice in the happiness of all - Love will produce another effect. We should not "envy" them, because he that is under the influence of Christian love is more happy than those in the world who are usually the objects of envy. There is often much wretchedness under a clothing "of purple and fine linen." There is not always happiness in a splendid mansion; in the caresses of the great; in a post of honor; in a palace, or on a throne. Alexander the Great wept on the throne of the world. Happiness is in the heart; and contentment, and the love of God, and the hope of heaven produce happiness which rank, and wealth, and fashion, and earthly honor cannot purchase. And could the sad and heavy hearts of those in elevated ranks of life be always seen; and especially could their end be seen, there would be no occasion or disposition to envy them.<p>Lord, what a thoughtless wretch was I,<p>To mourn, and murmur, and repine,<p>To see the wicked placed on high,<p>In pride and robes of honour shine!<p>But oh! their end, their dreadful end!<p>Thy sanctuary taught me so;<p>On slipp'ry rocks I see them stand,<p>And fiery billows roll below.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. suffereth long&#8212;under provocations of evil from others.

The apostle, in this and some following verses, enumerates the several properties and characters of the grace of love; and all along represents it as if it was a person, and no doubt designs one who is possessed of it, and in whose heart it is implanted and reigns; such an one is said to "suffer long", or be "patient", as the Vulgate Latin and Ethiopic versions read; not only under afflictions by the hand of God, which such an one considers as arising from love; but under the reproaches and persecutions of men, for the sake of Christ and his Gospel, and in imitation of him; such a person is slow to anger when abused, not quick of resentment, nor hasty to revenge when affronted; but exercises forbearance, suffers long, and bears much, and is ready to forgive: <p>and is kind; liberal, and bountiful, does good to all men, even to enemies, and especially to the household of faith; he is gentle to all men, affable and courteous to his brethren, and not morose, churlish, and ill natured; he is easy and yielding to the tempers and humours of men; accommodates himself to their infirmities, capacities, manners, and circumstances, in everything he can, that is not contrary to the glory of God, the interest of Christ, the honour of religion, his own con science, and the good of men; <p>charity envieth not; or he that has the grace of love to God, Christ, and the saints, does not envy the temporal happiness of others, though it is what he has not, or is greater than he enjoys; as Rachel envied her sister, because she had children when she herself had none; as Joseph's brethren envied him because he had a greater share in his father's affections than they had; or as good men may be tempted to envy the prosperity of the wicked, when they themselves are in adversity; but this grace, when in exercise, will not suffer a person to do: nor will such an one envy the superior measures of grace, the more excellent spiritual gifts, or the greater degree of usefulness, and of success in any spiritual undertaking, and so of greater honour and respect, in any of the saints and servants of Christ to themselves, of which Moses and John the Baptist are remarkable instances, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/11-28.htm">Numbers 11:28</a>, <p>charity vaunteth not itself, is not ostentatious, a proud boaster; either of what he has, the things of nature, as wisdom, riches, honour, strength, &amp;c. or spiritual gifts; or of what he does, since what such an one does, he does from a principle of love, and with a view to the glory of God, and not to be seen of men, or to gain their esteem and applause: or is not rash, and precipitant; does not run headlong into measures, to promote his own honour and interest, without considering what will be the consequence of things; nor is he rash with his mouth, or hasty with his lips, to utter anything unbecoming before God or men. The Arabic version renders it, "does not speak deceitfully"; or hypocritically, for nothing is more contrary to true genuine love than this; the Syriac version renders it, "is not tumultuous"; noisy and seditious: such an one is not troublesome in a commonwealth, nor does he go into parties and factions in churches, but is all the reverse: <p>is not puffed up swelled with pride, and elated with a vain conceit of himself, of his parts and abilities, of his learning, eloquence, wisdom, and knowledge, as the false teachers in this church were; knowledge without grace, unsanctified knowledge, mere notional speculative knowledge, puffeth up; but charity, or the grace of love, does not; that edifies and preserves persons from being puffed up with themselves, or one against another. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_corinthians/13.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{2}</span> Charity <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> suffereth long, <i>and</i> is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,</span><p>(2) He describes the force and nature of charity, partly by a comparison of opposites, and partly by the effects of charity itself.

THE QUALITIES OF CHRISTIAN LOVE. The previous vv. have justified the <span class="greekheb">καθʼ ὑπερβολὴν</span> of <a href="/1_corinthians/12-31.htm" title="But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet show I to you a more excellent way.">1 Corinthians 12:31</a>. The loftiest human faculties of man are seen to be frustrate without love; by its aid alone are they brought to their proper excellence and just use. But this “way” of Christian attainment has still to be “described,” and the promise of <a href="/1_corinthians/12-31.htm" title="But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet show I to you a more excellent way.">1 Corinthians 12:31</a><span class="ital"> b</span> fulfilled. So while <a href="/context/1_corinthians/13-1.htm" title="Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal....">1 Corinthians 13:1-3</a> have proved the <span class="ital">necessity</span>, the rest of the chap. shows the <span class="ital">nature and working</span> of the indispensable <span class="greekheb">ἀγάπη</span>. The Cor[1981] may see in this description the mirror of what they ought to be and are not; they will learn how childish are the superiorities on which they plume themselves. (<span class="ital">a</span>) The <span class="ital">behaviour</span> of Love is delineated in fifteen exquisite aphorisms (<a href="/context/1_corinthians/13-4.htm" title="Charity suffers long, and is kind; charity envies not; charity braggs not itself, is not puffed up,...">1 Corinthians 13:4-7</a>); (<span class="ital">b</span>) its <span class="ital">permanence</span>, in contrast with the transitory and partial character of the prized <span class="greekheb">χαρίσματα</span> (<a href="/context/1_corinthians/13-8.htm" title="Charity never fails: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away....">1 Corinthians 13:8-13</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1981] Corinth, Corinthian or Corinthians.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/1_corinthians/13.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">4</span>. <span class="ital">Charity suffereth long, and is kind</span>] The first the passive, the second the active, exercise of love; the one endurance, the other beneficence.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">vaunteth not itself</span>] The word here used is derived from the Latin <span class="ital">perperus</span>, vicious, boastful. Both this and the next sentence have reference to the manner in which excellencies he <span class="ital">actually possesses</span> are regarded by one imbued with the spirit of love. Cf. <a href="/romans/12-3.htm" title="For I say, through the grace given to me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God has dealt to every man the measure of faith.">Romans 12:3</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/1_corinthians/13.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/1_corinthians/13-4.htm" title="Charity suffers long, and is kind; charity envies not; charity braggs not itself, is not puffed up,">1 Corinthians 13:4</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἡ ἀγάπη</span>, <span class="ital">love</span>) He points out the nature of love. He does not say, love speaks with tongues, prophesies, gives to the poor: but it is long-suffering. This is a metonymy for the man, who has love. But Paul chiefly mentions those fruits of love, necessary in the use of the gifts, which he requires from the Corinthians, and without which there may be prophecies, but there can be no profit. If we take <a href="/1_corinthians/8-1.htm" title="Now as touching things offered to idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but charity edifies.">1 Corinthians 8:1</a>, we may advantageously compare together the delineation of love which Paul adapted to the Corinthians, and the delineation of wisdom, which James in like manner adapted to [portrayed for] those to whom he wrote, <a href="/james/3-17.htm" title="But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.">Jam 3:17</a>.—<span class="greekheb">μακροθυμεῖ</span>, <span class="ital">suffers long</span>) The twelve praises of love are enumerated by three classes, <a href="/context/1_corinthians/13-4.htm" title="Charity suffers long, and is kind; charity envies not; charity braggs not itself, is not puffed up,...">1 Corinthians 13:4-7</a>—(if we reckon together one pair at the beginning, and two pairs at the end, as we show in the following notes). The first consists of two members, (1.) <span class="ital">it suffers long, is kind:</span> (2.) <span class="ital">envies not</span>. We have the same synthesis and antithesis, <a href="/galatians/5-22.htm" title="But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,">Galatians 5:22</a>; <a href="/galatians/5-20.htm" title="Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, jealousies, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,">Galatians 5:20</a>. <span class="ital">Long-suffering</span> has respect to evil proceeding from others: <span class="ital">kind</span> has respect to the extending of good to others; on the other hand, it does not grieve at another’s good, nor rejoice at another’s calamity.

Envy - "one shape of many names" - includes malice, grudge, jealousy, pique, an evil eye, etc., with all their base and numerous manifestations. <span class="cmt_word">Vaunteth not itself.</span> The meaning would probably be most nearly expressed by the colloquialism, <span class="accented">does not show off.</span> It does not, for instance, "do its alms before men to be seen of them" (<a href="/matthew/6-1.htm">Matthew 6:1</a>). The Latin <span class="accented">perperus</span>, which is from the same root as this word, means "a braggart," or "swaggerer." Cicero, speaking of a grand oratorical display of his own before Pompey, says to Atticus, "Good heavens! how I <span class="accented">showed myself off</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>) before my new hearer, Pompeius!" ('Ad. Art.,' 1:14). <span class="cmt_word">Is not puffed up.</span> Has no purse proud or inflated arrogance."   Love, therefore, is free from the characteristic vice of the Corinthian Church (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-6.htm">1 Corinthians 4:6, 18, 19</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/5-2.htm">1 Corinthians 5:2</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/8-1.htm">1 Corinthians 8:1</a>). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/1_corinthians/13.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Suffereth long (&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;)<p>See on <a href="/james/5-7.htm">James 5:7</a>.<p>Is kind (&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)<p>Only here in the New Testament.

Used of one who sounds his own praises. Cicero introduces a compound of the word in one of his letters to Atticus, describing his speech in the presence of Pompey, who had just addressed the senate on his return from the Mithridatic war. He says: "Heavens!
