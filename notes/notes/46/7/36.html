In this view, the general meaning is plain. Children should seek and follow the directions of their parents as to marriage. And parents should consult their children's wishes; and not reckon they have power to do with them, and dictate just as they please, without reason. The whole is closed with advice to widows. Second marriages are not unlawful, so that it is kept in mind, to marry in the Lord. In our choice of relations, and change of conditions, we should always be guided by the fear of God, and the laws of God, and act in dependence on the providence of God. Change of condition ought only to be made after careful consideration, and on probable grounds, that it will be to advantage in our spiritual concerns.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That he behaveth himself uncomely - Acts an unbecoming part, imposes an unnecessary, painful, and improper constraint, crosses her inclinations which are in them selves proper.<p>Toward his virgin - His daughter, or his ward, or any unmarried female committed to his care.<p>If she pass the flower of her age - If she pass the marriageable age and remains unmarried.

He speaks in the plural number because marriage is between two persons. The reason of this determination is, because the apostle, in his former discourse, had no where condemned a married estate during the present distress of things, as sinful or unlawful, but only as inexpedient, or not so expedient as a single life during the present distress; he had before determined, <span class="bld"><a href="/1_corinthians/7-9.htm" title="But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.">1 Corinthians 7:9</a></span>, that it was <span class="ital">better to marry than to burn.</span> Now no inexpediency of a thing can balance what is plainly sinful. If therefore the case be such, that a man or woman must marry, or sin, through marriage brings with it more care and trouble, yet it is to be preferred before plain sinning. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_corinthians/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But if any man think,.... This some understand of a man that is engaged, or betrothed to a virgin, and protracts marriage, who may use his prudence in consummating it, if he pleases, for any thing the apostle has said to the contrary: but it is better to understand it of a parent, or one that has the care and guardianship of virgins; if such an one is of opinion, <p>that he behaveth himself uncomely towards his virgin: by exposing her to contempt and reproach, in retaining her at home, and not giving her in marriage when at proper age for such a state; it being reckoned reproachful to be at, or past the age of marriage, or to be in years, and not married; or by so doing lay her under temptation to do that which is uncomely, to commit fornication, which would be uncomely, both to him, and to her; and such a tendency has living in a single state, contrary to inclination. The apostle may have respect to a Jewish tradition founded upon the supposed sense of  <a href="/leviticus/19-29.htm">Leviticus 19:29</a> "do not prostitute thy daughter to cause her to be a whore" (s). <p>"Says R. Eliezer, this is he who marries his daughter to an old man. Says R.

Theodoret puts it well: <span class="greekheb">τὸ δοκοῦν πραττέτω</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">γαμείτωσαν</span>] namely, <span class="ital">the virgin and he who wishes to have her</span>. It is arbitrary, considering the general form of the whole discussion (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-25.htm" title="Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment, as one that has obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful.">1 Corinthians 7:25</a>), to maintain, as Rückert does, that the plural refers to a particular couple respecting whom the Corinthians had asked a question. “Wolf, Heydenreich, and others adopt a needlessly harsh assumption, that Paul passes here from the singular to the plural (<span class="ital">the virgins</span>). Billroth again propounds the very unlikely view that “<span class="ital">the youths</span>” should be supplied here as the subject, and <span class="greekheb">αὐτήν</span> as the object.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1258] <span class="ital">d</span> refers to the note of the commentator or editor named on the particular passage.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1259] <span class="ital">l.</span> and others; and other passages; and other editions.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1262] .<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. <span class="greekheb">καὶ τὰ λοιπά</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1263] <span class="ital">d</span> refers to the note of the commentator or editor named on the particular passage.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1264] <span class="ital">d</span> refers to the note of the commentator or editor named on the particular passage.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1265] Theophylact begins the apodosis with <span class="greekheb">καὶ οὕτως</span>: <span class="greekheb">γενέσθω</span>, <span class="greekheb">φησὶ</span>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ οὕτω</span>. <span class="greekheb">πῶς</span>; <span class="greekheb">ὃ θέλει ποιείτω</span>. In that case <span class="greekheb">κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">οὕτως ὀφ</span>. <span class="greekheb">γίν</span>. would be quite superfluous, the <span class="greekheb">καί</span> deprived of its reference, and <span class="greekheb">οὐχ ἁμαρτ</span>. would not suit the obligatory <span class="greekheb">ὀφείλει</span>. Similarly Hofmann, who follows the same view, paraphrasing it thus: “<span class="ital">This too</span> (?) is a <span class="ital">necessity arising from the nature of the case, that he do what he will</span>.” Laurent also makes <span class="greekheb">καὶ οὕτως ὀφ</span>. <span class="greekheb">γίν</span>. the apodosis, expounding it to mean: <span class="ital">so it must be in this case also</span>.

FREEDOM TO MARRY. The question of the marriage of Cor[1201] Christian maidens Paul has discussed on grounds of expediency. The narrow earthly horizon, the perils of the Christian lot, the division between religious and domestic duty esp. probable under these conditions, render the married state undesirable (<a href="/context/1_corinthians/7-28.htm" title="But and if you marry, you have not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she has not sinned. Nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh: but I spare you....">1 Corinthians 7:28-34</a>). The Ap. does not on these grounds <span class="ital">forbid</span> marriage,—to do so would entangle some of his readers perilously; he <span class="ital">recommends</span> what appears to him the course generally fitting, and advantageous for their spiritual interests (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-35.htm" title="And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare on you, but for that which is comely, and that you may attend on the Lord without distraction.">1 Corinthians 7:35</a> f.). If the parent’s judgment points the other way, or if circumstances are such as to enforce consent, then so let it be (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-36.htm" title="But if any man think that he behaves himself uncomely toward his virgin, if she pass the flower of her age, and need so require, let him do what he will, he sins not: let them marry.">1 Corinthians 7:36</a>). But where the father can thus decide without misgiving, he will do well to keep his daughter at home (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-37.htm" title="Nevertheless he that stands steadfast in his heart, having no necessity, but has power over his own will, and has so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin, does well.">1 Corinthians 7:37</a> f.). Similarly in the case of the Christian <span class="ital">widow</span>: she is free to marry “in the Lord”; but, in Paul’s decided opinion, she will be happier to refrain (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-39.htm" title="The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband lives; but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord.">1 Corinthians 7:39</a> f.). The Ap. gives <span class="ital">inspired advice</span>, and the bias of his own mind is clearly seen; but he finds no sin in marriage; he guards sensitively the rights of individual feeling and conscience, and leaves the decision in each case to the responsible parties.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1201] Corinth, Corinthian or Corinthians.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/1_corinthians/7.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">36</span>. <span class="ital">his virgin</span>] i.e. <span class="ital">his daughter</span>. The advice here given is to <span class="ital">parents</span>. In St Paul’s time, and in most continental countries now, it is the parents who decide on the marriage of their children. In France, and in some other foreign countries, the young people very often do not even see one another before they are contracted. But St Paul thinks it might in some cases be ‘unseemly’ conduct on the part of a parent to refuse a proposal of marriage for a daughter who desired to serve God in the married state.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">if she pass the flower of her age</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">If she have fully attained</span> it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and need so require</span>] Literally, <span class="bld">and so it ought to be</span>; that is, if it be fair and reasonable that the wish of both parties should be carried out, and it would be harsh to act otherwise. Some think that the reference is to the disgrace incurred by a maiden, especially a Jewish maiden who had passed the age of maturity, and was still unmarried—a disgrace which also attached to a Jewish father who had not provided a suitable marriage for her. Cf. <a href="//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/7-25.htm" title="Marry thy daughter, and so shalt thou have performed a weighty matter: but give her to a man of understanding.">Sir 7:25</a>, “Marry thy daughter, and thou hast performed a weighty matter.” See also <a href="//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/42-9.htm" title="In her virginity, lest she should be defiled and gotten with child in her father's house; and having an husband, lest she should misbehave herself; and when she is married, lest she should be barren.">Sir 42:9</a>. The Rabbins advised rather that a slave should be released as a husband for the daughter, than that she should remain unmarried. Others, again think that the danger of sin (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-2.htm" title="Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband.">1 Corinthians 7:2</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/7-5.htm" title="Defraud you not one the other, except it be with consent for a time, that you may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency.">1 Corinthians 7:5</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/7-9.htm" title="But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.">1 Corinthians 7:9</a>) is here referred to.
