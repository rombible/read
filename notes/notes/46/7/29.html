Let us not for one moment think that this principle was evolved by St. Paul from a mistaken belief that the Second Advent was close at hand. This principle of life was taught by Christ Himself. He warned men against living carelessly because they thought “the Lord delayeth His coming.” They were to be ever on the watch, as servants for the unexpected return of their master—as guests for the coming of the bridegroom. It was not the opinion that Christ would soon come which led St. Paul to hold and teach this principle of Christian life. Perhaps it was his intense realisation of this eternal truth which the Lord had taught, his assimilation of it as part of his very being, from which the conviction arose that the Advent was not only in theory always, but, as a matter of fact, then near at hand. Hope and belief mysteriously mingled together in one longing unity of feeling.<p>It may be asked, if the Apostles were mistaken on this point, may they not have been mistaken about other things also? The best answer to such a question, perhaps, is that this was just <span class= "ital">the</span> one point on which our Lord had said they <span class= "ital">should not</span> be informed, and it is the one point on which they <span class= "ital">were not</span> informed. “Times and seasons” were to be excluded from their knowledge (<a href="/acts/1-6.htm" title="When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, will you at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?">Acts 1:6</a>).<p><span class= "bld">The time is short: it remaineth . . .</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">The time that remains is shortened, so that both they that have wives,</span> &c. (the Greek word for “remain” (<span class= "ital">to loipon</span>) is used frequently by St. Paul in a sort of adverbial way, <a href="/2_corinthians/13-11.htm" title="Finally, brothers, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you.">2Corinthians 13:11</a>; <a href="/ephesians/6-10.htm" title="Finally, my brothers, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.">Ephesians 6:10</a>; <a href="/philippians/4-8.htm" title="Finally, brothers, whatever things are true, whatever things are honest, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.">Philippians 4:8</a>). The words “so that” do not introduce a series of apostolic exhortations based upon and growing out of the previous statement regarding the brevity of the remaining time, but they express what was God’s intention in thus making the time short. St. Paul regards everything as having its place and purpose in the divine economy. If the time were long (and the teaching applies equally—for the principle is the same—to the brevity of life), then, indeed, men might live as having “much goods laid up for many years” (<a href="/luke/12-19.htm" title="And I will say to my soul, Soul, you have much goods laid up for many years; take your ease, eat, drink, and be merry.">Luke 12:19</a>); but the time of life is short, that each may keep himself from being the slave of the external conditions and relationships of life. Such is the force of the series of striking contrasts with which the Apostle now illustrates the habit of life which God intended to follow from the shortening of the time.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_corinthians/7.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/1_corinthians/7-29.htm" title="But this I say, brothers, the time is short: it remains, that both they that have wives be as though they had none;...">1 Corinthians 7:29-31</a>. </span><span class="ital">But this I say, </span>&c. — But though I leave every one to his own liberty in the case now mentioned, yet here is what is necessary for all to observe. <span class="ital">The time </span>— Of our abode here, and of these worldly enjoyments; <span class="ital">is short: it remaineth </span>— It plainly follows; <span class="ital">that those who have wives be as though they had none </span>— Namely, as serious, zealous, and active, dead to the world, as devoted to God, as holy in all manner of conversation, preserving themselves from all inordinate affection toward them, and to be prepared to leave them, or to part with them, whenever a wise, unerring, and gracious Providence shall call them so to do. By so easy a transition does the apostle slide from every thing else to the one thing needful, and, forgetting whatever is temporal, is swallowed up in eternity. <span class="ital">And they that weep — </span>That sorrow on account of any trouble; <span class="ital">as though they wept not </span>— Knowing that the end of temporal troubles, as of temporal joys, is fast approaching, and therefore not being too much concerned, cast down, and distressed on account of them. <span class="ital">And they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not </span>— Knowing the transitory nature of all earthly joys, and therefore tempering their joy with godly fear. <span class="ital">And they that buy, as though they possessed not </span>— Considering that they hold nothing here by a certain tenure, but must shortly resign all, and therefore not placing much dependance on any thing secular for happiness; and knowing themselves to be only stewards, and not proprietors of what they possess, and that they must shortly be called to give an account of the use they have made of it. <span class="ital">And they that use this world — </span>That is, the comforts and accommodations thereof; <span class="ital">as not abusing it </span>— By employing them to other ends than those to which they were intended; or in another manner than that prescribed by the great Proprietor of all, and not seeking happiness therein, but in God: using every thing only in such a manner and degree as most tends to the knowledge and love of him. <span class="ital">For the fashion of this world </span>— The whole scheme of it, and the manner and way of living or conversing here, with the several conditions, relations, and connections of life; this marrying, weeping, rejoicing, and all the rest, not only will pass, but now <span class="ital">passeth away, </span>is this moment flying off like a shadow.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:25-35 Considering the distress of those times, the unmarried state was best. Notwithstanding, the apostle does not condemn marriage. How opposite are those to the apostle Paul who forbid many to marry, and entangle them with vows to remain single, whether they ought to do so or not! He exhorts all Christians to holy indifference toward the world. As to relations; they must not set their hearts on the comforts of the state. As to afflictions; they must not indulge the sorrow of the world: even in sorrow the heart may be joyful. As to worldly enjoyments; here is not their rest. As to worldly employment; those that prosper in trade, and increase in wealth, should hold their possessions as though they held them not. As to all worldly concerns; they must keep the world out of their hearts, that they may not abuse it when they have it in their hands. All worldly things are show; nothing solid. All will be quickly gone. Wise concern about worldly interests is a duty; but to be full of care, to have anxious and perplexing care, is a sin. By this maxim the apostle solves the case whether it were advisable to marry. That condition of life is best for every man, which is best for his soul, and keeps him most clear of the cares and snares of the world. Let us reflect on the advantages and snares of our own condition in life; that we may improve the one, and escape as far as possible all injury from the other. And whatever cares press upon the mind, let time still be kept for the things of the Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But this I say - Whether you are married or not, or in whatever condition of life you may be, I would remind you that life hastens to a close, and that its grand business is to be prepared to die. It matters little in what condition or rank of life we are, if we are ready to depart to another and a better world.<p>The time is short - The time is "contracted," "drawn into a narrow space" (&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  sunestalmenos). The word which is used here is commonly applied to the act of "furling" a sail, that is, reducing it into a narrow compass; and is then applied to anything that is reduced within narrow limits. Perhaps there was a reference here to the fact that the time was "contracted," or made short, by their impending persecutions and trials. But it is always equally true that time is short. It will soon glide away, and come to a close. The idea of the apostle here is, that the plans of life should all be formed in view of this truth, that time is short. No plan should be adopted which does not contemplate this; no engagement of life made when it will not be appropriate to think of it; no connection entered into when the thought "time is short," would be an unwelcome intruder; see <a href="/1_peter/4-7.htm">1 Peter 4:7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_peter/3-8.htm">2 Peter 3:8-9</a>.<p>It remaineth - (&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;  to loipon). The remainder is; or this is a consequence from this consideration of the shortness of time.<p>Both they that have wives ... - This does not mean that they are to treat them with unkindness or neglect, or fail in the duties of love and fidelity. It is to be taken in a general sense, that they were to live above the world; that they were not to be unduly attached to them that they were to be ready to part with them; and that they should not suffer attachment to them to interfere with any duty which they owed to God. They were in a world of trial; and they were exposed to persecution; and as Christians they were bound to live entirely to God, and they ought not, therefore, to allow attachment to earthly friends to alienate their affections from God, or to interfere with their Christian duty. In one word, they ought to be "just as faithful to God," and "just as pious," in every respect, as if they had no wife and no earthly friend. Such a consecration to God is difficult, but not impossible. Our earthly attachments and cares draw away our affections from God, but they need not do it. Instead of being the occasion of alienating our affections from God, they should be, and they might be, the means of binding us more firmly and entirely to him and to his cause. But alas, how many professing Christians live for their wives and children only, and not for God in these relations! how many suffer these earthly objects of attachment to alienate their minds from the ways and commandments of God, rather than make them the occasion of uniting them more tenderly to him and his cause! <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>29. this I say&#8212;A summing up of the whole, wherein he draws the practical inference from what precedes (1Co 15:50).<p>the time&#8212;the season (so the Greek) of this present dispensation up to the coming of the Lord (Ro 13:11).

The clause, "as to what remains," though in construction belonging to the previous clause, in sense belongs to the following. However, Cyprian and Vulgate support English Version.<p>as though they had none&#8212;We ought to consider nothing as our own in real or permanent possession.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_corinthians/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> He had before spoken to what concerned some, now he comes to what concerneth all. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The time</span> (saith he) <span class="bld">is short; </span> furled up, like sails when the mariner comes near his port. He either meaneth the time of this life, or the time of the world’s duration; we often find the apostles speaking of their times as the last times (and in these senses all are concerned): or the time of the church’s rest and tranquillity, which they had hitherto enjoyed in a far more perfect degree than they enjoyed them soon after this, when ten persecutions followed immediately one upon the neck of another. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">It remaineth, that both they that have wives be as though they had none; </span> therefore (saith the apostle) it is the concernment of all Christians, not to indulge themselves too much in the pleasures and contentments of this life; but if ye be married, or shall marry, you will be concerned to keep your hearts as loose from the contentment and satisfaction men use to take in their wives, as if you had no wives at all. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_corinthians/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But this I say, brethren, the time is short,.... This is another reason, with which the apostle supports his advice to virgins, and unmarried persons, to remain so; since the time of life is so very short, and it is even but a little while to the end of the world, and second coming of Christ; and therefore seeing the marriage state is so full of care and trouble, and it affords still less time for the service of Christ and religion, he thought it most advisable for them to, continue in a single life, that they might be more at leisure to make use of that little time they had for their spiritual good and welfare, the edification of others, and the glory of Christ: unless it should be rather thought that the apostle is still enlarging upon the former argument, taken from the present time, being a time of distress and persecution; and so the phrase, "the time is short", or "contracted", and full of anguish and affliction, is the same with the present necessity, and trouble in the flesh; and since this was the case, he suggests again, that an unmarried state was most preferable: <p>it remaineth that both they that have wives, be as though they had none: and as for the rest, they that were married, his advice to them was, that they should so behave as if they were not married; not that he would have them put away their wives, or fancy with themselves that they had none, or make no use of the marriage bed; but suggests a moderate use of it; he would not have them give up themselves to lasciviousness and carnal lusts and pleasures, even with their own wives, and spend their time altogether in their company and embraces: but since the time of life was short, and that full of troubles, they should spend it in the service and worship of God, private and public, as much as possible; and not in the indulging and satisfying of the flesh. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_corinthians/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But this I say, brethren, the time <i>is</i> <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> short: it remaineth, that both they that have wives be as though they had none;</span><p>(a) For we are now in the latter end of the world.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/1_corinthians/7.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/context/1_corinthians/7-29.htm" title="But this I say, brothers, the time is short: it remains, that both they that have wives be as though they had none;...">1 Corinthians 7:29-31</a>. <span class="ital">This, however, I say</span>, i.e. <span class="ital">of what follows I assure you</span>.

The time is short, the world is passing away. In whatever condition a man is, let him live in a constant state of readiness to abandon it at the bidding of God. Let him keep his soul unfettered by the ties, the enjoyments, and above all, the cares of this life. There are several ways of rendering this passage, but they do not materially affect the meaning.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the time is short</span>] Not time in the general sense. The word here signifies a definite space of time. Cf. the English version of <a href="/1_john/2-18.htm" title="Little children, it is the last time: and as you have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.">1 John 2:18</a>, ‘the last time.’ The word translated <span class="ital">short</span> is rather <span class="ital">shortened</span>. “Compressed.” Robertson. “Living many years in one.” Stanley.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/1_corinthians/7.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/1_corinthians/7-29.htm" title="But this I say, brothers, the time is short: it remains, that both they that have wives be as though they had none;">1 Corinthians 7:29</a>. <span class="greekheb">Τοῦτο δέ φημι</span>, <span class="ital">but this I say</span>) The same form of expression occurs <a href="/1_corinthians/15-50.htm" title="Now this I say, brothers, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither does corruption inherit incorruption.">1 Corinthians 15:50</a>, for the purpose of explanation, in summing up the whole.—<span class="greekheb">ἀδελφοὶ</span>, <span class="ital">brethren</span>) Paul is wont, especially when writing about external circumstances, to introduce the most noble digressions, as the Holy Spirit is always calling him to the things that are most excellent.—<span class="greekheb">ὁ καιρὸς</span>) the present <span class="ital">time</span>, either of the world <a href="/1_corinthians/7-31.htm" title="And they that use this world, as not abusing it: for the fashion of this world passes away.">1 Corinthians 7:31</a>, ch. <a href="/1_corinthians/10-11.htm" title="Now all these things happened to them for ensamples: and they are written for our admonition, on whom the ends of the world are come.">1 Corinthians 10:11</a>, or of individuals, the time of weeping, rejoicing, etc.—<span class="greekheb">συνεσταλμένος</span>) <span class="ital">narrow, short</span>, the contrary of unencumbered liberty, <a href="/1_corinthians/7-26.htm" title="I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress, I say, that it is good for a man so to be.">1 Corinthians 7:26</a>.—<span class="greekheb">τὸ λοιπὸν</span>, [<span class="ital">but</span>] <span class="ital">as to what remains</span>) The particle here is very suitable. [<span class="ital">He hints, that the consummation of the world is not far off</span>.—V. g.]—<span class="greekheb">ἵνα</span>, <span class="ital">that</span>) Time in short, is of such a nature, <span class="ital">that</span> they ought, etc. [<span class="ital">Some spend much of their time in seeking the superfluous</span> conveniences <span class="ital">of life, in wandering</span> thoughts, <span class="ital">in a too pertinacious pursuit</span> of literature, <span class="ital">in the length and frequency of their</span> feasts and amusements: and <span class="ital">it is a virtue in the opinion of worldly men, when any one knows how to spend with his boon companions in a manner not without its charm, half or even whole days and nights in empty conversation and pursuits. But if it should become necessary either to engage in prayer, or to watch over the education of his children, or to exemplify the duty of love to his neighbour, then truly the want of time is made an obstacle; nay, he has not even leisure to consider, how much guilt is contracted by such conduct</span>.—V. g.]—<span class="greekheb">γυναῖκας</span>, <span class="ital">wives</span>) and so, <span class="ital">children, friends, patrons</span>.

The word <span class="accented">sunestalmenos</span> cannot mean "disastrous." The verb is used for "folding up" in <a href="/acts/5-6.htm">Acts 5:6</a>; "Tempus in collecto est" (Tertullian). It remaineth, that. The reading and punctuation are here uncertain. The best reading seems to be "The time has been shortened henceforth, in order that," etc. The very object of the hastened end is that Christians should sit loose to earthly interests. <span class="cmt_word">As though they had none.</span> They would thus be nearer to the condition of the "angels in heaven." <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/1_corinthians/7.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Time (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2;)<p>Not, the period of mortal life; but the time which must elapse before the Lord appears.<p>Short (&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;)<p>Rev., correctly, giving the force of the participle, shortened.

Only here and <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/5-6.htm">Acts 5:6</a>, where it is used of the winding up of Ananias' corpse. In classical Greek of furling sails, packing luggage, reducing expenses, etc. Applied to time, the word is very graphic.<p>It remaineth that (&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd; &#x3b9;&#788;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;)<p>The meaning is rather henceforth, or for the future. That (&#x3b9;&#788;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;) in any case is to be construed with the time is shortened. According to the punctuation by different editors, we may read either: the time is shortened that henceforth both those, etc.; or, the time is shortened henceforth, that both those, etc. The former is preferable. The time is shortened that henceforth Christians may hold earthly ties and possessions but loosely. </body></html>
