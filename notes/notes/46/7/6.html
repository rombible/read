What he does say is, that the foregoing instructions are not to be considered as absolute commands from him, but as general permissive instruction, to be applied by each individual according to circumstances.<p>It has been much discussed as to what part of the previous passage the word “this” refers. It is perhaps best to take it as referring to the leading thought of the whole passage, which is that marriage is allowable, expressed especially in <a href="/1_corinthians/7-2.htm" title="Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband.">1Corinthians 7:2</a>.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:1-9 The apostle tells the Corinthians that it was good, in that juncture of time, for Christians to keep themselves single. Yet he says that marriage, and the comforts of that state, are settled by Divine wisdom. Though none may break the law of God, yet that perfect rule leaves men at liberty to serve him in the way most suited to their powers and circumstances, of which others often are very unfit judges.

On this commentators are divided. The more natural and obvious interpretation would be to refer it to the preceding statement. I am inclined to think that the mare natural construction is the true one. and that Paul refers to what he had said in <a href="/1_corinthians/7-5.htm">1 Corinthians 7:5</a>. Most recent commentators, as Macknight and Rosenmuller, however, suppose it refers to what follows, and appeal to similar places in <a href="/joel/1-2.htm">Joel 1:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/49-2.htm">Psalm 49:2</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/10-23.htm">1 Corinthians 10:23</a>.

This word means "indulgence," or "permission," and stands opposed to that which is expressly enjoined; compare <a href="/1_corinthians/7-25.htm">1 Corinthians 7:25</a>. "I am 'allowed' to say this; I have no express command on the subject; I give it as my opinion; I do not speak it directly under the influence of divine inspiration;" see <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-10.htm">1 Corinthians 7:10</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-25.htm">1 Corinthians 7:25</a>, <a href="/1_corinthians/7-40.htm">1 Corinthians 7:40</a>. Paul here does not claim to be under inspiration in these directions which he specifics. But this is no argument against his inspiration in general, but rather the contrary. For:<p>(1) It shows that he was an honest man, and was disposed to state the exact truth. An impostor, pretending to inspiration, would have claimed to have been always inspired. Who ever heard of a pretender to divine inspiration admitting that in any thing he was not under divine guidance? Did Mahomet ever do this? Do impostors now ever do it?<p>(2) it shows that in other cases, where no exception is made, he claimed to be inspired. These few exceptions, which he expressly makes, prove that in everywhere else he claimed to be under the influence of inspiration.<p>(3) we are to suppose, therefore, that in all his writings where he makes no express exceptions, (and the exceptions are very few in number,) Paul claimed to be inspired. Macknight, however, and some others, understand this as mere adVice, as an inspired man, though not as a command,<p>Not of commandment - Not by express instruction from the Lord; see <a href="/1_corinthians/7-25.htm">1 Corinthians 7:25</a>. I do not claim in this to be under the influence of inspiration; and my counsel here may be regarded, or not, as you may be able to receive it. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. by permission &#8230; not of commandment&#8212;not by God's permission to me to say it: but, "by way of permission to you, not as a commandment."

The apostle said this, <p>not of commandment; but, consulting their good, gives this advice, lest Satan should be busy with them, and draw them into sin; but if they had the gift of continence, they might continue apart longer; there was no precise time fixed by God, nor did the apostle pretend to fix any: or it may refer to what follows after, that he would have all men be as he was; though he laid no injunction, but left them to their liberty; unless it can be thought to regard marriage in general, and to be said in opposition to a Jewish notion, which makes marriage  a "command"; <p>"a man, they say (f), is bound to this command at seventeen years of age, and if he passes twenty and does not marry, he transgresses, and makes void an affirmative precept;'' <p>but the apostle puts it as a matter of choice, and not of obligation. <p>(f) Maimon.
