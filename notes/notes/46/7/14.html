In contrast to that other union in which the connection is defiling (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-16.htm" title="What? know you not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body? for two, said he, shall be one flesh.">1Corinthians 6:16</a>), the purity of the believing partner in this union, being a lawful one, as it were, entirely overweighs the impurity of the unbeliever, it being not a moral, but a kind of ceremonial impurity. The children of such marriages were considered to be Christian children; and the fruit being holy, so must we regard as holy the tree from which it springs. It must be remembered that the “sanctification” and “holiness” here spoken of is not that inward sanctification which springs from the action of the Holy Spirit in the individual heart, but that consecration which arises from being in the body of Christ, which is the Christian Church (<a href="/romans/9-16.htm" title="So then it is not of him that wills, nor of him that runs, but of God that shows mercy.">Romans 9:16</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_corinthians/7.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/1_corinthians/7-14.htm" title="For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy.">1 Corinthians 7:14</a></span>. <span class="ital">For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife </span>— That is, so far that their matrimonial converse is as lawful, holy, and honourable, as if they were both of the same faith: and in many instances the unbeliever, whether husband or wife, hath been converted to God by the instrumentality of the believing partner. The former sense, however, and not this latter, seems to be the primary meaning of the apostle. <span class="ital">Else were your children unclean </span>— And must be looked upon as unfit to be admitted to those peculiar ordinances by which the seed of God’s people are distinguished; <span class="ital">but now are they holy </span>— Confessedly; and are as readily admitted to baptism as if both the parents were Christians: so that the case, you see, is in effect decided by this prevailing practice. So Dr. Doddridge, who adds, “On the maturest and most impartial consideration of this text, I must judge it to refer to infant baptism. Nothing can be more apparent than that the word <span class="ital">holy </span>signifies <span class="ital">persons </span>who might be permitted to partake of the distinguishing rites of God’s people. See <a href="/exodus/19-6.htm" title="And you shall be to me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation.

And as for the interpretation, which so many of our brethren, the Baptists, have contended for, that <span class="ital">holy </span>signifies <span class="ital">legitimate, </span>and <span class="ital">unclean, illegitimate, </span>(not to urge that this seems an unscriptural sense of the word,) nothing can be more evident, than that the argument will by no means bear it; for it would be proving a thing by itself, (idem per idem,) to argue that the converse of the parents was lawful, because the children were not bastards; whereas all who thought the converse of the parents unlawful, must of course think that the children were illegitimate.” Thus also Dr. Whitby: “He doth not say, ‘else were your children bastards, but now they are legitimate,’ but<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>‘else were they unclean;’ that is, heathen children, not to be owned as a holy seed, and therefore not to be admitted into covenant with God, as belonging to his holy people. That this is the true import of the words <span class="greekheb">ακαθαρτα </span>and <span class="greekheb">αγια</span>, will be apparent from the Scriptures, in which the heathen are styled <span class="ital">the unclean, </span>in opposition to the Jews, who were in covenant with God, and therefore styled a <span class="ital">holy people. </span>Whence it is evident that the Jews looked upon themselves as <span class="greekheb">δουλοι Θεου καθαροι</span>, <span class="ital">the clean servants of God, </span><a href="/nehemiah/2-20.htm" title="Then answered I them, and said to them, The God of heaven, he will prosper us; therefore we his servants will arise and build: but you have no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem.">Nehemiah 2:20</a>; and upon all the heathen and their offspring, as unclean, by reason of their want of circumcision, and the sign of the covenant. Hence, whereas it is said that <span class="ital">Joshua circumcised the people, </span>chap. <a href="/1_corinthians/5-4.htm" title="In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when you are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,">1 Corinthians 5:4</a>, the LXX. say, <span class="greekheb">περιεκαθαρεν</span>, <span class="ital">he cleansed them. </span>Moreover, of heathen children, and such as are not circumcised, they say, <span class="ital">they are not born in holiness; </span>but they, on the contrary, are styled <span class="greekheb">σπερμα αγιον</span>, <span class="ital">a holy seed, </span><a href="/isaiah/6-13.htm" title="But yet in it shall be a tenth, and it shall return, and shall be eaten: as a teil tree, and as an oak, whose substance is in them, when they cast their leaves: so the holy seed shall be the substance thereof.">Isaiah 6:13</a>; <a href="/ezra/9-2.htm" title="For they have taken of their daughters for themselves, and for their sons: so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the people of those lands: yes, the hand of the princes and rulers has been chief in this trespass.">Ezra 9:2</a>; and the offspring from them, and from those proselytes which had embraced their religion, are said to be born <span class="ital">in holiness, </span>and so thought fit to be admitted to circumcision, or baptism, or whatsoever might initiate them into the Jewish Church; and therefore to this sense of the words <span class="ital">holy </span>and <span class="ital">unclean, </span>the apostle may be here most rationally supposed to allude. And though one of the parents be still a heathen, yet is the denomination to be taken from the better, and so their offspring are to be esteemed, not as heathen, that is, unclean, but holy; as all Christians by denomination are. Hence, then, the argument for infant baptism runs thus: ‘If the holy seed among the Jews was therefore to be circumcised, and be made federally holy, by receiving the sign of the covenant, and being admitted into the number of God’s holy people, because they were born in sanctity; then, by like reason, the holy seed of Christians ought to be admitted to baptism, and receive the sign of the Christian covenant, the laver of regeneration, and so be entered into the society of the Christian Church.’ So also Clemens Alexandrinus and Tertullian.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:10-16 Man and wife must not separate for any other cause than what Christ allows. Divorce, at that time, was very common among both Jews and Gentiles, on very slight pretexts. Marriage is a Divine institution; and is an engagement for life, by God's appointment. We are bound, as much as in us lies, to live peaceably with all men, Ro 12:18, therefore to promote the peace and comfort of our nearest relatives, though unbelievers. It should be the labour and study of those who are married, to make each other as easy and happy as possible. Should a Christian desert a husband or wife, when there is opportunity to give the greatest proof of love? Stay, and labour heartily for the conversion of thy relative. In every state and relation the Lord has called us to peace; and every thing should be done to promote harmony, as far as truth and holiness will permit.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For the unbelieving husband - The husband that is not a Christian; who still remains a pagan, or an impenitent man. The apostle here states reasons why a separation should not take place when there was a difference of religion between the husband and the wife. The first is, that the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the believing wife. And the object of this statement seems to be, to meet an objection which might exist in the mind, and which might, perhaps, be urged by some. "Shall I not be polluted by such a connection? Shall I not be defiled, in the eye of God, by living in a close union with a pagan, a sinner, an enemy of God, and an opposer of the gospel?" This objection was natural, and is, doubtless, often felt. To this the apostle replies, "No; the contrary may he true. The connection produces a species of sanctification, or diffuses a kind of holiness over the unbelieving party by the believing party, so far as to render their children holy, and therefore it is improper to seek for a separation."<p>Is sanctified - &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;  he&#772;giastai. There has been a great variety of opinions in regard to the sense of this word. It does not comport with my design to state these opinions. The usual meaning of the word is, to make holy; to set apart to a sacred use; to consecrate, etc; see the note at <a href="/john/17-17.htm">John 17:17</a>. But the expression cannot mean here:<p>(1) That the unbelieving husband would become holy, or be a Christian, "by the mere fact" of a connection "with" a Christian, for this would be to do violence to the words, and would be contrary to facts everywhere; nor,<p>(2) That the unbelieving husband had been sanctified by the Christian wife (Whitby), for this would not be true in all cases; nor,<p>(3) That the unbelieving husband would gradually become more favorably inclined to Christianity, by observing its effects on the wife (according to Semler); for, though this might be true, yet the apostle was speaking of something then, and which rendered their children at that time holy; nor,<p>(4) That the unbelieving husband might more easily be sanctified, or become a Christian, by being connected with a Christian wife (according to Rosenmuller and Schleusner), because he is speaking of something in the connection which made the children holy; and because the word &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;  hagiazo&#772; is not used in this sense elsewhere. But it is a good rule of interpretation, that the words which are used in any place are to be limited in their signification by the connection; and all that we are required to understand here is, that the unbelieving husband was sanctified "in regard to the subject under discussion;" that is, in regard to the question whether it was proper for them to live together, or whether they should be separated or not. And the sense may be, "They are by the marriage tie one flesh. They are indissolubly united by the ordinance of God. As they are one by his appointment, as they have received his sanction to the marriage union, and as one of them is holy, so the other is to be regarded as sanctified, or made so holy by the divine sanction to the union, that it is proper for them to live together in the marriage relation." And in proof of this, Paul says if it were not so, if the connection was to he regarded as impure and abominable, then their children were to be esteemed as illegitimate and unclean. But now they were not so regarded, and could not so be; and hence, it followed that they might lawfully continue together. So Calvin, Beza, and Doddridge interpret the expression.<p>Else were your children unclean - (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;  akatharta). Impure; the opposite of what is meant by holy. Here observe:<p>(1) That this is a reason why the parents, one of whom was a Christian and the other not, should not be separated; and,<p>(2) The reason is founded on the fact, that if they were separated, the offspring of such a union must be regarded as illegitimate, or unholy; and,<p>(3) It must be improper to separate in such a way, and for such a reason, because even they did not believe, and could not believe, that their children were defiled, and polluted, and subject to the shame and disgrace attending illegitimate children.<p>This passage has often been interpreted, and is often adduced to prove that children are "federally holy," and that they are entitled to the privilege of baptism on the ground of the faith of one of the parents. But against this interpretation there are insuperable objections:<p>(1) The phrase "federally holy" is unintelligible, and conveys no idea to the great mass of people. It occurs no where in the Scriptures, and what can be meant by it?<p>(2) it does not accord with the scope and design of the argument. There is not one word about baptism here; not one allusion to it; nor does the argument in the remotest degree hear upon it. The question was not whether children should be baptized, but it was whether there should be a separation between man and wife, where the one was a Christian and the other not. Paul states, that if such a separation should take place, it would imply that the marriage was improper; and of course the children must be regarded as unclean. But how would the supposition that they were federally holy, and the proper subjects of baptism, bear on this? Would it not be equally true that it was proper to baptize the children whether the parents were separated or not? Is it not a doctrine among Pedobaptists everywhere, that the children are entitled to baptism upon the faith of either of the parents, and that that doctrine is not affected by the question here agitated by Paul? Whether it was proper for them to live together or not, was it not equally true that the child of a believing parent was to be baptized? But,<p>(3) The supposition that this means that the children would be regarded as illegitimate if such a separation should take place, is one that accords with the whole scope and design of the argument. "When one party is a Christian and the other not shall there be a separation?" This was the question. "No," says Paul; if there is such a separation, it must be because the marriage is improper; because it would be wrong to live together in such circumstances. What would follow from this? Why, that all the children that have been born since the one party became a Christian, must be regarded as having been born while a connection existed that was improper, and unChristian, and unlawful, and of course they must be regarded as illegitimate. But, says he, you do not believe this yourselves. It follows, therefore, that the connection, even according to your own views, is proper.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. sanctified&#8212;Those inseparably connected with the people of God are hallowed thereby, so that the latter may retain the connection without impairing their own sanctity (compare 1Ti 4:5); nay, rather imparting to the former externally some degree of their own hallowed character, and so preparing the way for the unbeliever becoming at last sanctified inwardly by faith.<p>by &#8230; by&#8212;rather, "in &#8230; in"; that is, in virtue of the marriage tie between them.<p>by the husband&#8212;The oldest manuscripts read, "by the brother." It is the fact of the husband being a "brother," that is, a Christian, though the wife is not so, that sanctifies or hallows the union.<p>else &#8230; children unclean&#8212;that is, beyond the hallowed pale of God's people: in contrast to "holy," that is, all that is within the consecrated limits [Conybeare and Howson]. The phraseology accords with that of the Jews, who regarded the heathen as "unclean," and all of the elect nation as "holy," that is, partakers of the holy covenant. Children were included in the covenant, as God made it not only with Abraham, but with his "seed after" him (Ge 17:7). So the faith of one Christian parent gives to the children a near relationship to the Church, just as if both parents were Christians (compare Ro 11:16). Timothy, the bearer of this Epistle, is an instance in point (Ac 16:1). Paul appeals to the Corinthians as recognizing the principle, that the infants of heathen parents would not be admissible to Christian baptism, because there is no faith on the part of the parents; but where one parent is a believer, the children are regarded as not aliens from, but admissible even in infancy as sharers in, the Christian covenant: for the Church presumes that the believing parent will rear the child in the Christian faith. Infant baptism tacitly superseded infant circumcision, just as the Christian Lord's day gradually superseded the Jewish sabbath, without our having any express command for, or record of, transference. The setting aside of circumcision and of sabbaths in the case of the Gentiles was indeed expressly commanded by the apostles and Paul, but the substitution of infant baptism and of the Lord's day were tacitly adopted, not expressly enacted. No explicit mention of it occurs till Iren&aelig;us in the third century; but no society of Christians that we read of disputed its propriety till fifteen hundred years after Christ. Anabaptists would have us defer baptism till maturity as the child cannot understand the nature of it. But a child may be made heir of an estate: it is his, though incapable at the time of using or comprehending its advantage; he is not hereafter to acquire the title and claim to it: he will hereafter understand his claim, and be capable of employing his wealth: he will then, moreover, become responsible for the use he makes of it [Archbishop Whately].<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_corinthians/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div>Ver. 13,14. Sanctifying, in holy writ, generally signifieth the separation or setting apart of a person or thing from a common, to and for a holy use, whether it be by some external rites and ceremonies, or by the infusing of some inward spiritual habits. In this place it seemeth to have a different sense from what it usually hath in holy writ; for it can neither signify the sanctification of the person by infused habits of grace; for neither is the unbelieving husband thus sanctified by the believing wife, neither is the unbelieving wife thus sanctified by the believing husband; nor are either of them thus set apart for the service of God by any legal rites: which hath made a great difference in the notions of interpreters, how <span class="ital">the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the</span> believing <span class="ital">wife, </span> or <span class="ital">the unbelieving wife, by the</span> believing <span class="ital">husband.</span> Some think it signifies no more than prepared for God, as <span class="ital">sanctified</span> signifies, <span class="bld"><a href="/isaiah/13-3.htm" title="I have commanded my sanctified ones, I have also called my mighty ones for my anger, even them that rejoice in my highness.">Isaiah 13:3</a></span>. Others think they are sanctified by a moral denomination. I rather think it signifies, brought into such a state, that the believer, without offence to the law of God, may continue in a married estate with such a yoke-fellow; and the state of marriage is a holy state, notwithstanding the disparity with reference to religion. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Else were your children unclean; </span> otherwise, he saith, the children begotten and born of such parents would be unclean, in the same state that the children of pagan parents are without the church, not within the covenant, not under the promise. In one sense all children are unclean, i.e. children of wrath, born in sin, and brought forth in iniquity; but all are not in this sense unclean, some are within the covenant of grace, within the church, capable of baptism. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">But now are they holy; </span> these are those that are called <span class="ital">holy; </span> not as inwardly renewed and sanctified, but relatively, in the same sense that all the Jewish nation are called <span class="ital">a holy people:</span> and possibly this may give us a further light to understand the term <span class="ital">sanctifed, </span> in the former part of the verse. The unbelieving husband is so far sanctified by the believing wife, and the unbelieving wife so far sanctified by the believing husband, that as they may lawfully continue in their married relation, and live together as man and wife, so the issue coming from them both shall be by God counted in covenant with him, and have a right to baptism, which is one of the seals of that covenant, as well as those children both whose parents are believers. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_corinthians/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife,.... That is, "by the believing wife"; as the Vulgate Latin and Syriac versions read, and so it is read in some copies; and likewise in the next clause the same is read, <p>by the believing husband; this is a reason given by the apostle why they should live together. This cannot be understood of internal sanctification, which is never the case; an unbeliever cannot be sanctified by a believer in this sense, for such a sanctification is only by the Spirit of God; nor external sanctification, or an outward reformation, which though the unbelieving yoke fellow may sometimes be a means of, yet not always; and besides, the usefulness of one to another in such a relation, in a spiritual sense, urged as a reason for living together, in <a href="/1_corinthians/7-16.htm">1 Corinthians 7:16</a> nor merely of the holiness of marriage, as it is an institution of God, which is equally the same in unbelievers as believers, or between a believer and an unbeliever, as between two believers; but of the very act of marriage, which, in the language of the Jews, is expressed by being "sanctified"; instances almost without number might be given of the use of the word  in this sense, out of the Misnic, Talmudic, and Rabbinic writings; take the following one instead of a thousand that might be produced (s). <p>"The man  "sanctifies", or espouses a wife by himself, or by his messenger; the woman  "is sanctified", or espoused by herself, or by her messenger. The man  "sanctifies", or espouses his daughter, when she is a young woman, by himself or by his messenger; if anyone says to a woman,  "be thou sanctified", or espoused to me by this date (the fruit of the palm tree,)  "be thou sanctified", or espoused to me by this (any other thing); if there is anyone of these things the value of a farthing,  "she is sanctified", or espoused, and if not she is not  "sanctified", or "espoused"; if he says, by this, and by this, and by this, if there is the value of a farthing in them all,  "she is sanctified", or espoused; but if not, she is not  "sanctified", or espoused; if she eats one after another, she is not  "sanctified", or espoused, unless there is one of them the value of a farthing;'' <p>in which short passage, the word which is used to "sanctify", or be "sanctified", in the Hebrew language, is used to espouse, or be espoused no less than "ten" times. So the Jews (t) interpret the word "sanctified", in <a href="/job/1-5.htm">Job 1:5</a> he espoused to them wives; in the Misna, the oral law of the Jews, there is a whole treatise of "sanctifications" (u), or espousals; and in the Gemara or Talmud (w) is another, full of the disputes of the doctors on this subject. Maimonides has also written a treatise of women and wives (x), out of which might be produced almost innumerable instances in proof of the observation; and such as can read, and have leisure to read the said tracts, may satisfy themselves to their heart's content. Let it be further observed; that the preposition  which is in most versions rendered "by", should be rendered "in" or "to" or "unto", as it is in the next verse, and in many other places; see <a href="/matthew/17-12.htm">Matthew 17:12</a> <a href="/colossians/1-23.htm">Colossians 1:23</a> if it be rendered in the former way, "in", it denotes the near union which by marriage the man and woman are brought into; if in the latter, it designs the object to which the man or woman is espoused, and the true sense and even the right rendering of the passage is this: "for the unbelieving husband is espoused to the wife, and the unbelieving wife is espoused to the husband"; they are duly, rightly, and legally espoused to each other; and therefore ought not, notwithstanding their different sentiments of religion, to separate from one another; otherwise, if this is not the case, if they are not truly married to one another, this consequence must necessarily follow; that the children born in such a state of cohabitation, where the marriage is not valid, must be spurious, and not legitimate, and which is the sense of the following words: <p>else were your children unclean, but now are they holy; that is, if the marriage contracted between them in their state of infidelity was not valid, and, since the conversion of one of them, can never be thought to be good; then the children begotten and born, either when both were infidels, or since one of them was converted, must be unlawfully begotten, be base born, and not a genuine legitimate offspring; and departure upon such a foot would be declaring to all the world that their children were illegitimate; which would have been a sad case indeed, and contains in it another reason why they ought to keep together; whereas, as the apostle has put it, the children are holy in the same sense as their parents are; that as they are sanctified, or lawfully espoused together, so the children born of them were in a civil and legal sense holy, that is, legitimate; wherefore to support the validity of their marriage, and for the credit of their children, it was absolutely necessary they should abide with one another. The learned Dr. Lightfoot says, that the words "unclean" and "holy" denote not children unlawfully begotten, and lawfully begotten; but Heathenism and Christianism; and thinks the apostle alludes to the distinction often made by the Jews, of the children of proselytes being born in "holiness", or out of it, that is, either before they became proselytes or after; but it should be observed, that though the word "holiness" is used for Judaism, yet not for Christianity; and besides, the marriages of Heathens were not looked upon as marriages by the Jews, and particularly such mixed ones as of a Jew and Gentile, they were not to be reckoned marriages; for so they say (y), <p>"he that espouses a Gentile woman, or a servant,  , "they are not espousals"; but lo, he is after the espousals as he was before the espousals; and so a Gentile, or a servant, that espouses a daughter of Israel,   , "those espousals are no espousals";'' <p>nor do they allow children begotten of such persons to be legitimate. This learned writer himself owns such a tradition, and which he cites (z), <p>"that a son begotten in uncleanness is a son in all respects, and in general is reckoned as an Israelite, though he is a bastard,    , "but a son begotten on a Gentile woman is not his son";'' <p>all which are just the reverse of what the apostle is here observing; and who, it must be remarked, is speaking of the same sort of holiness of children as of parents, which cannot be understood of Christianity, because one of the parents in each is supposed to be an Heathen. The sense I have given of this passage, is agreeable to the mind of several interpreters, ancient and modern, as Jerom, Ambrose, Erasmus, Camerarius, Musculus, &amp;c. which last writer makes this ingenuous confession; formerly, says he, I have abused this place against the Anabaptists, thinking the meaning was, that the children were holy for the parents' faith; which though true, the present place makes nothing for the purpose: and I hope, that, upon reading this, everyone that has abused it to such a purpose will make the like acknowledgment; I am sure they ought. <p>(s) Misn.

Paul’s judgment, therefore, is that the Christian <span class="greekheb">ἁγιότης</span>, the higher analogue of the Jewish theocratic consecration to God, affects even the non-believing partner in a marriage, and so passes over to him that he does not remain a profane person, but through the intimate union of wedded life becomes partaker (as if by a <span class="ital">sacred</span> contagion) of the higher divinely consecrated character of his consort, who belongs to the Israel of God, the holy <span class="greekheb">φύραμα</span> (<a href="/galatians/6-16.htm" title="And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and mercy, and on the Israel of God.">Galatians 6:16</a>; <a href="/romans/11-16.htm" title="For if the first fruit be holy, the lump is also holy: and if the root be holy, so are the branches.">Romans 11:16</a>).[1117] The clause: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΠΕῚ ἌΡΑ ΤᾺ ΤΈΚΝΑ</span></span> <span class="bld"><span class="ital">Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span></span></span>[1118], shows that what the <span class="greekheb">ἄπιστος</span> is here said to have entered upon is not the moral holiness of the <span class="ital">new birth</span> (the subjective condition of which is nothing else but faith), but the holy consecration of that <span class="ital">bond of Christian fellowship</span> which forms the <span class="greekheb">ἐκκλησία Θεοῦ</span>, of which holiness, as arising out of this fellowship, the non-believing husband, in virtue of the inner union of life in which he stands to his Christian consort, has become a partaker (not, of course, without receiving a blessing morally also). The non-believer is, as it were, affiliated to the holy order of Christians by his union of married life with a Christian person, and, so soon as his spouse is converted to Christ and has thereby become holy, he too on his part participates in his own person (not “simply in his <span class="ital">married</span> relationship,” to which Hofmann, following older interpreters, unwarrantably restricts the meaning of the text) in his consort’s holiness, the benefit of which he receives in virtue of his fellowship of life with her, so that he is no longer <span class="greekheb">ἀκάθαρτος</span> as hitherto, but—although <span class="ital">mediately</span> after the fashion described—a <span class="greekheb">ἡγιασμένος</span>.

On the contrary, the relationship which Paul here enunciates simply and without any artificial saving clause is one which consists in the <span class="ital">immediate close fellowship of life</span>, by virtue of which the consecration of Christian holiness attaching to the parents passes over from them to their children also, to whom otherwise, as being still <span class="greekheb">ἀπίστοις</span>, the predicate <span class="greekheb">ἀκάθαρτα</span> would rightly belong. Equally close and cordial is the fellowship of life between husband and wife, while every other kind of mutual connection is less intimate, and forms a more distant degree of vital union.

The sacred character imparted by Christianity has, since it imparts union with Christ the Lord of all, a power to overbear the impurity of the non-Christian partner in wedlock. Meyer’s note is very striking here. He says that “the Christian sanctity affects even the non-believing partner in a marriage and so passes over to him that he does not remain a profane person, but through the intimate union of wedded life becomes partaker (as if by a sacred contagion) of the higher divinely consecrated character of his consort.” And this is because matrimony is “a holy estate instituted of God.” For the much stricter view under the Law, Dean Stanley refers to Ezra, ch. 9, and <a href="/nehemiah/9-2.htm" title="And the seed of Israel separated themselves from all strangers, and stood and confessed their sins, and the iniquities of their fathers.">Nehemiah 9:2</a>; <a href="/context/nehemiah/13-23.htm" title="In those days also saw I Jews that had married wives of Ashdod, of Ammon, and of Moab:...">Nehemiah 13:23-28</a>.

They stand upon a different footing to marriages contracted <span class="ital">before</span> admission into covenant with God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">else were your children unclean, but now are they holy</span>] This principle applies also to the children of such a marriage. The sanctity, i.e. the consecration, of the parent possessing the life of Christ, and living in holy wedlock with an unbelieving husband or wife, descends to the child, which from its birth may be regarded as ‘holy to the Lord.’ “Which we may not so understand as if the children of baptized parents were without sin, or grace from baptized parents derived by propagation, or God by covenant and promise tied to save any in mere regard of their parents’ belief: yet to all professors of the name of Christ this pre-eminence above infidels is freely given, that the fruit of their bodies bringeth into the world with it a present interest and right to those means wherewith the ordinance of Christ is that His Church shall be sanctified.” Hooker, <span class="ital">Ecclesiastical Polity</span>, Book v. lx. 6.
