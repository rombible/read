A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases: but God has called us to peace.">1Corinthians 7:15</a> as a general principle to be ever borne in mind, as limiting in practice the very broad liberty which the Apostle has given regarding separation in cases of mixed marriages. It is to be noticed that in <a href="/1_corinthians/7-15.htm" title="But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases: but God has called us to peace.">1Corinthians 7:15</a> the unbelieving partner is the only one who is spoken of as taking an active part in the separation; the believer is, merely for the sake of peace, to acquiesce in it; he is never to cause or promote a separation, for he is to be guided by the great principle that we are to continue to walk in those social and political relations by which we were bound when God called us. Christianity does not destroy them, but purifies and exalts them, and thus makes them more binding on us than before. According as the Lord has divided to each man his portion in life, and as God has called each man, so in that condition let him continue to walk as a Christian. Let him not try to change it for another. The words “God” and “Lord” have been transposed by later copyists. The order in the English version is different from that in the older MSS. It is important to preserve the accurate reading here, for it speaks of Christ—“the Lord”—as the one who allots to men their natural condition in life, while “God” calls them from heathenism to the Christian faith.<p><span class= "bld">And so ordain I in all churches.</span>—This principle was of universal application, and the Apostle lays it down authoritatively for all Churches. The <span class= "ital">I</span> is emphatic, as the writer speaks with apostolic authority. It is noticeable that in some few later MSS. there is an attempt to weaken its force by the substitution of “I teach” for “I appoint or direct.” (See <a href="/1_corinthians/16-1.htm" title="Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do you.">1Corinthians 16:1</a>.)<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:17-24 The rules of Christianity reach every condition; and in every state a man may live so as to be a credit to it. It is the duty of every Christian to be content with his lot, and to conduct himself in his rank and place as becomes a Christian. Our comfort and happiness depend on what we are to Christ, not what we are in the world. No man should think to make his faith or religion, an argument to break through any natural or civil obligations. He should quietly and contentedly abide in the condition in which he is placed by Divine Providence.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But as God hath distributed ... - As God hath divided (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;  emerisen); that is, given, imparted to anyone. As God has given grace to everyone. The words &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787; &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#768;  ei me&#772; denote simply but in the beginning of this verse. The apostle here introduces a new subject; or an inquiry varying somewhat from that preceding, though of the same general nature. He had discussed the question whether a husband and wife ought to be separated on account of a difference in religion. He now says that the general principle there stated ought to rule everywhere; that people who become Christians ought not to seek to change their condition or calling in life, but to remain in that situation in which they were when they became Christians, and show the excellence of their religion in that particular calling. The object of Paul, therefore, is to preserve order, industry, faithfulness in the relations of life, and to show that Christianity does not design to break up the relations of social and domestic contact. This discussion continues to <a href="/1_corinthians/7-24.htm">1 Corinthians 7:24</a>. The phrase "as God hath distributed" refers to the condition in which people are placed in life, whether as rich or poor, in a state of freedom or servitude, of learning or ignorance, etc. And it implies that God appoints the lot of people, and orders the circumstances of their condition; that religion is not designed to interfere directly with this; and that people should seek to show the real excellence of religion in the particular sphere in which they may have been placed by divine providence before they became converted.<p>As the Lord hath called everyone - That is, in the condition or circumstances in which anyone is when he is called by the Lord to be a Christian.<p>So let him walk - In that sphere of life; in that calling <a href="/1_corinthians/7-20.htm">1 Corinthians 7:20</a>; in that particular relation in which he was, let him remain, unless he can consistently change it for the better, and there let him illustrate the true beauty and excellence of religion. This was designed to counteract the notion that the fact of embracing a new religion dissolved the relations of life which existed before. This idea probably prevailed extensively among the Jews. Paul's object is to show that the gospel, instead of dissolving those relations, only strengthened them, and enabled those who were converted the better to discharge the duties which grow out of them.<p>And so ordain I ... - This is no unique rule for you Corinthians. It is the universal rule which I everywhere inculcated. It is not improbable that there was occasion to insist everywhere on this rule, and to repress disorders which might have been attempted by some who might suppose that Christianity dissolved the former obligations of life. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17. But&#8212;Greek, "If not." "Only." Caution that believers should not make this direction (1Co 7:16; as Alford explains it) a ground for separating "of themselves" (1Co 7:12-14). Or, But if there be no hope of gaining over the unbeliever, still let the general principle be maintained, "As the Lord hath allotted to each, as God hath called each, so let him walk" (so the Greek in the oldest reading); let him walk in the path allotted to him and wherein he was called. The heavenly calling does not set aside our earthly callings.<p>so ordain I in all churches&#8212;Ye also therefore should obey.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_corinthians/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Calling in this place signifieth that station and course of life, wherein by the providence of God any man is set.

The sense of the text is, that the profession of Christianity is consistent with any honest calling or course of life, and it is the will of God tliat Christians should not pretend their profession of religion, to excuse them from the duties of any relation wherein they are set. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And so ordain I in all churches; </span> this is a universal rule, and concerned not the church of Corinth only, but all other churches of Christ, being an apostolical constitution. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_corinthians/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But as God hath distributed to every man,....

But this mode of joining on the verse is very harsh and forced in itself, and is, besides, unsuitable for this reason, that <a href="/1_corinthians/7-16.htm" title="For what know you, O wife, whether you shall save your husband? or how know you, O man, whether you shall save your wife?">1 Corinthians 7:16</a> was only a subordinate thought, to which <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕἸ ΜῊ</span></span> <span class="bld"><span class="ital">Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span></span></span>[1150] as a newly introduced leading idea stands in no logical nexus.

Paul desires now, in order to avert all frivolous and reckless procedure, to add to it the necessary limitation in the shape of a general principle of a practical kind, which should never be forgotten in connection with it.[1152] We may paraphrase accordingly somewhat in this fashion: “<span class="ital">The believer is not in bondage in this matter, having, on the contrary, been called in peace, and not so much as knowing whether he shall save his non-believing consort; he is not in bondage, only</span>[1153] <span class="ital">he is not to use this freedom in a light and regardless way, but to remember that it is limited by the rule that every one ought to abide in a conservative spirit by the position in which God has placed and called him, and to conduct himself accordingly, instead of possibly seeking to break it up without any very pressing cause</span>” Comp as in substance agreeing with this, Olshausen, de Wette, Osiander, Ewald, Maier. Pott holds that <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΧΩΡΊΖΕΤΑΙ</span></span></span> should be supplied after <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕἸ ΜΉ</span></span></span>; but the antithesis would require <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕἸ ΔῈ ΜΉ</span></span></span>, and the rule which follows would be very superfluous in a case where no separation had taken place, more especially after <a href="/1_corinthians/7-12.htm" title="But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother has a wife that believes not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away.">1 Corinthians 7:12</a> f.

Lastly, there is the view of those who would join <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕἸ ΜΉ</span></span></span> to the preceding clause (<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΙΝΈς</span></span></span> in Theophylact, Knatchbull, Homberg, Hammond, Olearius, Morus, and recently Hofmann): <span class="ital">if thou shalt save thy wife, if</span> (or) <span class="ital">not</span>?[1155] Now this is not, indeed, excluded by the <span class="greekheb">μή</span> (as Rückert thinks, who requires <span class="greekheb">οὐ</span>; but see Hartung, <span class="ital">Partikell</span>. II. p. 123); still the addition would be quite inappropriate to the sense of the two questions, for these convey the idea: <span class="ital">thou knowest not at all if</span>, etc., with which the alternative <span class="ital">necne</span> does not harmonize,—on which ground, too, Hofmann makes <a href="/1_corinthians/7-16.htm" title="For what know you, O wife, whether you shall save your husband? or how know you, O man, whether you shall save your wife?">1 Corinthians 7:16</a> to be the concluding confirmation of the whole admonition beginning with <span class="greekheb">τοῖς δὲ λοιποῖς</span> in <a href="/1_corinthians/7-12.htm" title="But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother has a wife that believes not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away.">1 Corinthians 7:12</a>. This, again, is impossible, for this reason, that the <span class="ital">first</span> part of the counsel given to the <span class="greekheb">λοιποί</span> has already received its confirmation in the <span class="greekheb">γάρ</span> of <a href="/1_corinthians/7-14.htm" title="For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy.">1 Corinthians 7:14</a>, and in accordance therewith the <span class="greekheb">γάρ</span> of <a href="/1_corinthians/7-16.htm" title="For what know you, O wife, whether you shall save your husband? or how know you, O man, whether you shall save your wife?">1 Corinthians 7:16</a> must now refer in the way of confirmation only to the <span class="ital">second</span> part of the said counsel, as contained in <a href="/1_corinthians/7-15.htm" title="But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases: but God has called us to peace.">1 Corinthians 7:15</a>.

Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised.">1 Corinthians 7:18</a>) cuique Dominus <span class="ital">beneficiorum suorum quasi partem tribuit</span>.” According to this, what would be meant would be the <span class="greekheb">μερὶς τοῦ κλήρου τῶν ἁγίων</span> (<a href="/colossians/1-12.htm" title=" Giving thanks to the Father, which has made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light:">Colossians 1:12</a>), which, however, refers to the bliss of the <span class="ital">future</span> <span class="greekheb">αἰών</span>, and would require, therefore, to be understood here <span class="ital">proleptically</span>. But there are two consideration which put a decided negative upon this view; first, the reference assumed for the absolute <span class="greekheb">ἐμέρ</span>. is not suggested by the context, (see, on the contrary, <a href="/1_corinthians/7-18.htm" title="Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised.">1 Corinthians 7:18</a> ff.); and, in the second place, logically the calling must <span class="ital">go first</span>, since <span class="ital">before</span> it there can be no mention of the Messianic <span class="greekheb">μερίζειν</span> (<a href="/romans/8-30.htm" title="Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.">Romans 8:30</a>; <a href="/romans/10-14.htm" title="How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?">Romans 10:14</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-12.htm" title=" Giving thanks to the Father, which has made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light:">Colossians 1:12</a>).

How often in the cases of conversion to Christianity must the deep inward change have had linked to it a yearning after some change of outward relationships!—an offence against the practical rule: “<span class="ital">Qua positus fueris, in statione mane</span>” (Ovid, <span class="ital">Fasti</span>, ii. 674), which Paul here gives expression to in a <span class="ital">Christian</span> form.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1153] Respecting <span class="greekheb">εἰ μή</span> in the sense of <span class="greekheb">πλήν</span>, see Poppo, <span class="ital">ad Thuc.</span> III. 1, p. 216; and respecting the principal sentence annexed to it, Buttmann, <span class="ital">neut.

Hofmann is wrong in holding that the <span class="greekheb">ὡς ἐμέρισεν</span> might lie on this side or on that of the calling, and might consist even in a change of the situation in which they had been when called.

This wider tendency the Ap. combats in the ensuing paragraph; he urges his readers to acquiesce in their position in life and to turn it to account as Christians. In Thessalonica a similar excitement had led men to abandon daily work and throw their support upon the Church (<a href="/1_thessalonians/4-11.htm" title="And that you study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you;">1 Thessalonians 4:11</a> f., <a href="/context/2_thessalonians/3-6.htm" title="Now we command you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you withdraw yourselves from every brother that walks disorderly, and not after the tradition which he received of us....">2 Thessalonians 3:6-15</a>).

He now proceeds to give two remarkable illustrations of his principle, calculated at once to arrest and fix the attention of the Corinthians. He applies it to the relations of Jew and Gentile; and to those of slave and freeman, and thus shews that Christianity was not intended to introduce a violent revolutionary element into society, but to sanctify existing relations until the time came that they could be amended. “Christianity interferes indirectly, not directly, with existing institutions.” Robertson.
