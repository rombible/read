The apostle's sense is, that such as had been circumcised, and had now embraced the faith of Christ, had no reason to be uneasy, or take any methods to remove this mark from their flesh, because it was abolished by Christ, and now of no significance; since as it did them no good, it did them no hurt: <p>is any called in uncircumcision? let him not become circumcised?; that is, if a Gentile who was never circumcised is called by grace, let him not submit to circumcision, which is now abrogated, and is altogether unnecessary and unprofitable in the business of salvation; yea, hurtful and pernicious if done on that account, since it makes men debtors to do the whole law, and Christ of none effect unto them. <p>(b) Antiqu. l. 12. c. 5. sect. 1.((c) Hieros.

Many, who had apostatized from the Jews to the Gentiles, recovered their uncircumcision to some extent by surgical skill, <a href="//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/1-15.htm" title="And made themselves uncircumcised, and forsook the holy covenant, and joined themselves to the heathen, and were sold to do mischief.">1Ma 1:15</a>. See <span class="ital">Reineccius</span> on this passage. It may be gathered from the admonition of Paul, that they were imitated by some, who from Jews had become Christians.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Being circumcised.</span> The first instance he gives is that of Judaism and paganism. The circumcised Jew is to remain circumcised; the uncircumcised Gentile is not to undergo circumcision. <span class="cmt_word">Become uncircumcised.</span> The Hellenising Jews in the days of the priest Menelaus (1 Macc. 1:15; Josephus, 'Ant.,' 12:05, 1) had discovered a process for obliterating the appearance of circumcision; such persons were known as <span class="accented">masochim.</span> St. Paul does not permit the adoption of this course. In the rebellion of Barcocheba many obliterated the sign of circumcision, and were afterwards, at great danger to themselves, recircumcised. ('Yevamoth,' tel. 72, 1). <span class="cmt_word">Let him not be circumcised.</span> This rule was of much more practical significance than the other. The early fortunes of Christianity had been almost shipwrecked by the attempt of Jewish rigorists to enforce this odious bondage on the Gentiles, and their deliverance flora it had been due almost solely to St. Paul. It was his inspired insight which had swayed the decision of the synod at Jerusalem (<a href="/acts/15.htm">Acts 15</a>.); and at a later period his Epistle to the Galatians was the manifesto of Gentile emancipation. He proved that after Christ's death "circumcision" (<span class="accented">peritome</span>) became to Gentiles a mere physical mutilation (<span class="accented">katatome</span>) (<a href="/philippians/3-2.htm">Philippians 3:2</a>). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/1_corinthians/7.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Become uncircumcised (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;)<p>The reference is to the process of restoring a circumcised person to his natural condition by a surgical operation.
