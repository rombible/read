Christians become members of this body by baptism. The outward rite is of Divine institution; it is a sign of the new birth, and is called therefore the washing of regeneration, Tit 3:5. But it is by the Spirit, only by the renewing of the Holy Ghost, that we are made members of Christ's body. And by communion with Christ at the Lord's supper, we are strengthened, not by drinking the wine, but by drinking into one Spirit. Each member has its form, place, and use. The meanest makes a part of the body. There must be a distinction of members in the body. So Christ's members have different powers and different places. We should do the duties of our own place, and not murmur, or quarrel with others. All the members of the body are useful and necessary to each other. Nor is there a member of the body of Christ, but may and ought to be useful to fellow-members. As in the natural body of man, the members should be closely united by the strongest bonds of love; the good of the whole should be the object of all. All Christians are dependent one upon another; each is to expect and receive help from the rest. Let us then have more of the spirit of union in our religion.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For by one Spirit - That is, by the agency or operation of the same Spirit, the Holy Spirit, we have been united into one body. The idea here is the same as that presented above <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-7.htm">1 Corinthians 12:7</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-11.htm">1 Corinthians 12:11</a>, by which all the endowments of Christians are traced to the same Spirit. Paul here says, that that Spirit had so endowed them as to fit them to constitute one body, or to be united in one, and to perform the various duties which resulted from their union in the same Christian church. The idea of its having been done by one and the same Spirit is kept up and often presented, in order that the endowments conferred on them might be duly appreciated.<p>Are we all - Every member of the church, whatever may be his rank or talents, has received his endowments from the same Spirit.<p>Baptized into one body - Many suppose that there is reference here to the ordinance of baptism by water. But the connection seems rather to require us to understand it of the baptism of the Holy Spirit <a href="/matthew/3-11.htm">Matthew 3:11</a>; and if so, it means, that by the agency of the Holy Spirit, they had all been suited, each to his appropriate place, to constitute the body of Christ - the church. If, however, it refers to the ordinance of baptism, as Bloomfield, Calvin, Doddridge, etc. suppose, then it means, that by the very profession of religion as made at baptism, by there being but one baptism <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/4-5.htm">Ephesians 4:5</a>, they had all professedly become members of one and the same body. The former interpretation, however, seems to me best to suit the connection.<p>Whether we be Jews or Gentiles - There is no difference. All are on a level. In regard to the grand point, no distinction is made, whatever may have been our former condition of life.<p>Bond or free - It is evident that many who were slaves were converted to the Christian faith. Religion, however, regarded all as on a level; and conferred no favors on the free which it did not on the slave. It was one of the happy lessons of Christianity, that it taught people that in the great matters pertaining to their eternal interests they were on the same level. This doctrine would tend to secure, more than anything else could, the proper treatment of those who were in bondage, and of those who were in humble ranks of life. At the same time it would not diminish, but would increase their real respect for their masters, and for those who were above them, if they regarded them as fellow Christians, and destined to the same heaven; see the note at <a href="/1_corinthians/7-22.htm">1 Corinthians 7:22</a>.<p>And have been all made to drink ... - This probably refers to their partaking together of the cup in the Lord's Supper. The sense is, that by their drinking of the same cup commemorating the death of Christ, they had partaken of the same influences of the Holy Spirit, which descend alike on all who observe that ordinance in a proper manner. They had shown also, that they belonged to the same body, and were all united together; and that however various might be their graces and endowments, yet they all belonged to the same great family. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. by &#8230; Spirit &#8230; baptized&#8212;literally, "in"; in virtue of; through.

There is an indirect allusion to the Lord's Supper, as there is a direct allusion to baptism in the beginning of the verse.

He saith, we are <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">baptized into one body, </span> by which he must mean the universal church, for Christ is the Head of that; particular churches are but parts of that church, of which Christ is the Head. Let men be of what nation they will, whether Jews or Gentiles, turning to the Christian religion, and of what condition they will, when they are baptized they are by it made members of that one body, of which Christ is the Head; though for the more convenient administration of, and participation in, the ordinances, they are divided into smaller societies, which also have the denomination of churches; as the smallest drop of water may be called water, though there be but one element of water. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And, </span> saith the apostle, we <span class="bld">have been all made to drink into one Spirit; </span> which some interpret as if it were, we have all drank of one Spirit, that is, been made partakers of one Spirit, whose benefits are, sometimes set out under the notion of water, <span class="ital">living water, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="/john/4-10.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to her, If you knew the gift of God, and who it is that said to you, Give me to drink; you would have asked of him, and he would have given you living water.">John 4:10</a>,14 7:38,39</span>; and so in the Old Testament, <span class="bld"><a href="/isaiah/12-3.htm" title="Therefore with joy shall you draw water out of the wells of salvation.">Isaiah 12:3</a> <a href="/context/ezekiel/47-1.htm" title="Afterward he brought me again to the door of the house; and, behold, waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward: for the forefront of the house stood toward the east, and the waters came down from under from the right side of the house, at the south side of the altar....">Ezekiel 47:1-23</a></span>. But many others choose rather to interpret drinking in this place, of drinking at the table of the Lord, partaking of that whole action being set out here by one particular act there performed. This is probable, considering that the apostle, in the former part of the verse, had been speaking of the other sacrament of the gospel, and that he, speaking of the Lord’s supper. <span class="bld"><a href="/1_corinthians/10-17.htm" title="For we being many are one bread, and one body: for we are all partakers of that one bread.">1 Corinthians 10:17</a></span>, had used this expression: <span class="ital">For we being many, are one bread, and one body.</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_corinthians/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For by one Spirit are we all baptized,.... This is to be understood not of water baptism; for the apostle says not in one, and the same water, but "by", or "in" one Spirit, are we all baptized; the baptism of water, and of the Spirit, are two different things; see <a href="/matthew/3-11.htm">Matthew 3:11</a>. Besides, all that are baptized in water, are not baptized in or by the Spirit, as the case of Simon Magus, and that of others, show; nor does water baptism incorporate persons into the church of Christ; neither into the invisible church, which is the body of Christ, and here meant; nor into a visible Gospel church state; they being indeed true believers, and baptized, are proper persons to be received into a church; but baptism itself does not put them into it, or make them members of it: persons may be baptized in water, and yet may never be joined to a church. There is indeed an allusion made to water baptism, but it is the grace of the Spirit in regeneration and sanctification which is here intended; which grace, both in the Old and in the New Testament, is frequently signified by water, and called a baptism, or a being baptized, because of the plenty, abundance, and superabundance of it, then bestowed; and is expressed by floods and rivers, and a well of living water; and is what qualifies and fits persons for the ordinance of water baptism. Now this is wrought by the Spirit of God, and is owing to his divine power and energy; not to water baptism, which has no regenerating virtue in it; nor to carnal regeneration, or a being born of blood, or of the best of men; nor to the will of any man; nor to the will of the flesh, or the power of man's freewill; but to God, to the Spirit, who is Lord and God, and the only sanctifier of the sons of men; by which spiritual baptism, or by whose grace in regeneration and conversion they are brought into one body: the mystical body of Christ, the universal and invisible church; that is, openly and manifestatively; for otherwise it is the grace of God in election, and in the everlasting covenant, choosing them in Christ, as members in their head, and constituting them such, that puts them among that number; but spiritual baptism, or the sanctifying grace of the Spirit, makes them appear to belong to that body, and makes them meet for, and gives them a right unto, a particular Gospel church, and the privileges of it, which the Spirit of God directs and brings them to. Whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; it matters not of what nation, or of what state and condition of life persons be; if they are regenerated and sanctified, they appear equally to belong to Christ, to be of his body, and have an equal propriety in all immunities and blessings belonging to his people; see <a href="/colossians/3-11.htm">Colossians 3:11</a><p>and have been all made to drink into one Spirit; are all partakers of the same graces of the Spirit, as faith, hope, love, &amp;c. and daily receive under his guidance, direction, and influence, out of the same fulness of grace in Christ, from whence they draw and drink this water with joy; and all drink the same spiritual drink, the blood of Christ, whose blood is drink indeed: and there may be in this clause an allusion to the ordinance of the supper, as in the former to the ordinance of baptism. Moreover, all new born babes, as they desire the sincere milk of the word, so they drink of it, and are refreshed with it, and are nourished by the words of faith, and sound doctrine, under the application, of the Spirit; and being trees of righteousness, and the planting of the Lord, the Spirit, they are watered by his grace, under the ministrations of the Gospel; and as they become one body under Christ, the head, so they are made to drink into one Spirit, or to become of one heart and soul with one another, being knit together in love, the bond of perfectness. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_corinthians/12.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For by one Spirit are we all baptized into <span class="cverse3">{n}</span> one body, whether <i>we be</i> Jews or Gentiles, whether <i>we be</i> bond or free; and have been all made to <span class="cverse3">{o}</span> drink into one Spirit.</span><p>(n) To become one body with Christ.<p>(o) By one quickening drink of the Lord's blood, we are made partakers of his Spirit alone.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/1_corinthians/12.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/1_corinthians/12-13.htm" title="For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.">1 Corinthians 12:13</a>.

The reference to <span class="ital">baptism</span> was correctly made by as early commentators as Chrysostom,[1985] Oecumenius, Theophylact; in recent times, by Rückert, Baur, de Wette, Ewald, Maier, Hofmann: <span class="ital">and we were all given to drink of one Spirit</span> (comp <a href="//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/15-3.htm" title="With the bread of understanding shall she feed him, and give him the water of wisdom to drink.">Sir 15:3</a>). To represent the <span class="ital">communication</span> of the Spirit which took place at baptism as a <span class="ital">giving to drink</span>, followed naturally from the conception of the <span class="ital">pouring out</span> of the Spirit,[1987] <a href="/john/7-37.htm" title="In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come to me, and drink.">John 7:37</a> ff.; <a href="/acts/2-17.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in the last days, said God, I will pour out of my Spirit on all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams:">Acts 2:17</a>; <a href="/romans/5-5.htm" title="And hope makes not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given to us.">Romans 5:5</a>; and is here, after being already mentioned with <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἑνὶ πνεύματι</span>, brought forward yet again <span class="ital">independently</span> and with peculiar <span class="ital">emphasis</span> as the <span class="ital">inward correlate</span> of the <span class="greekheb">ἓν σῶμα</span>.

The aorist is against both these interpretations, for its temporal significance must be the same with that of <span class="greekheb">ἐβαπτ</span>., and against the former of them is the reading <span class="greekheb">ἓν πνεῦμα</span> (without <span class="greekheb">εἰς</span>), by which the reference to the Lord’s Supper (see, in opposition to this, Theophylact) is debarred in this way, because the idea that we drink the Holy Spirit in the Lord’s Supper is not biblical, not even underlying <a href="/1_corinthians/10-3.htm" title="And did all eat the same spiritual meat;">1 Corinthians 10:3</a> f.

Such is St Chrysostom’s interpretation.

But the aorist tense here, as well as the unusually large number of various readings, seems to lead to the conclusion that the reference is to Baptism (St Chrysostom refers it to Confirmation), and not, as the words would seem at first sight to imply, to the Holy Communion. If this be the case, they refer to the altered condition of him who has entered into fellowship with Christ. Henceforward the Holy Spirit becomes an abiding possession with him, guaranteed by the Christian covenant (see St <a href="/context/john/3-3.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God....">John 3:3-5</a>, as above, and <a href="/1_corinthians/4-14.htm" title="I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn you.">1 Corinthians 4:14</a>, <a href="/context/1_corinthians/7-38.htm" title="So then he that gives her in marriage does well; but he that gives her not in marriage does better....">1 Corinthians 7:38-39</a>, <a href="/context/1_corinthians/14-16.htm" title="Else when you shall bless with the spirit, how shall he that occupies the room of the unlearned say Amen at your giving of thanks, seeing he understands not what you say?...">1 Corinthians 14:16-17</a>, <a href="/1_corinthians/15-26.htm" title="The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.">1 Corinthians 15:26</a>, <a href="/1_corinthians/16-7.htm" title="For I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a while with you, if the Lord permit.">1 Corinthians 16:7</a>, and cf.
