Christians become members of this body by baptism. The outward rite is of Divine institution; it is a sign of the new birth, and is called therefore the washing of regeneration, Tit 3:5. But it is by the Spirit, only by the renewing of the Holy Ghost, that we are made members of Christ's body. And by communion with Christ at the Lord's supper, we are strengthened, not by drinking the wine, but by drinking into one Spirit. Each member has its form, place, and use. The meanest makes a part of the body. There must be a distinction of members in the body. So Christ's members have different powers and different places. We should do the duties of our own place, and not murmur, or quarrel with others. All the members of the body are useful and necessary to each other. Nor is there a member of the body of Christ, but may and ought to be useful to fellow-members. As in the natural body of man, the members should be closely united by the strongest bonds of love; the good of the whole should be the object of all. All Christians are dependent one upon another; each is to expect and receive help from the rest. Let us then have more of the spirit of union in our religion.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>We bestow more abundant honour - Margin, "Put on." The words rendered "abundant honor" here, refer to clothing. We bestow upon them more attention and honor then we do on the face that is deemed comely, and that is not covered and adorned as the other parts of the body are.<p>More abundant comeliness - We adorn and decorate the body with frivilous apparel. Those parts which decency requires us to conceal we not only cover, but we endeavor as far as we can to adorn them. The face in the mean time we leave uncovered. The idea is, that, in like manner, we should not despise or disregard those members of the church who are of lower rank, or who are less favored than others with spiritual endowments. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>23. less honourable&#8212;"We think" the feet and the belly "less honorable," though not really so in the nature of things.<p>bestow &#8230; honour&#8212;putting shoes on (Margin) the feet, and clothes to cover the belly.<p>uncomely parts&#8212;the secret parts: the poorest, though unclad in the rest of the body, cover these.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_corinthians/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> All know what those parts of the body are, which are commonly judged <span class="bld">less honourable</span> and less comely; upon these we bestow more abundant honour and comeliness, by hiding them and covering them, that they are not, as the hands, and face, and head, (which we esteem more honourable parts of the body), exposed to the public view of those with whom we converse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_corinthians/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And those members of the body,....

I do not know who should be designed by these, unless backsliding believers, who have been suffered to fall into great sins; these are the uncomely parts of the church, who, when made sensible of their evils, are restored again, and received into the church; and a mantle of love is cast over all their failings; and all possible care taken that their faults may not be exposed to the world, that so the name of God, and ways of Christ, may not be blasphemed and evil spoken of. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_corinthians/12.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And those <i>members</i> of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant <span class="cverse3">{q}</span> honour; and our uncomely <i>parts</i> have more abundant comeliness.</span><p>(q) We more carefully cover them.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/1_corinthians/12.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">23</span>. <span class="ital">and those members of the body, which we think to be lets honourable, upon these we bestow</span> (literally, <span class="bld">these we surround with</span>) <span class="ital">more abundant honour</span>] i.e. by our admission that they are necessary to us. “The meanest trades are those with which we can least dispense.

The whole of this illustration is meant to show that rich and poor, great and small, high and low, gifted and ungifted, have all their own separate and indispensable functions, and no class of Christians can wisely disparage or forego the aid derived from other and different classes.
