In this and the following verse the Apostle reminds his readers that so far from regarding the marvellous manifestations of the Spirit, such as speaking with tongues and prophesying, as the most wonderful miracles, the greatest miracle of all was their conversion. That blind followers of dumb idols should be transformed into intelligent believers in the living Word was the most striking work of the Spirit. They were now no longer led hither and thither by diverse teachings and diverse gods; they had an unchanging principle of life, and an unerring guide of conduct. The contrast of the present state of Christians with their former state as heathens is a topic of frequent occurrence in St. Paul’s writings (<a href="/romans/11-30.htm" title="For as you in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief:">Romans 11:30</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-21.htm" title=" And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now has he reconciled">Colossians 1:21</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-7.htm" title=" In the which you also walked some time, when you lived in them.">Colossians 3:7</a>, &c.).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/12.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>12:1-11 Spiritual gifts were extraordinary powers bestowed in the first ages, to convince unbelievers, and to spread the gospel. Gifts and graces greatly differ. Both were freely given of God. But where grace is given, it is for the salvation of those who have it. Gifts are for the advantage and salvation of others; and there may be great gifts where there is no grace. The extraordinary gifts of the Holy Spirit were chiefly exercised in the public assemblies, where the Corinthians seem to have made displays of them, wanting in the spirit of piety, and of Christian love. While heathens, they had not been influenced by the Spirit of Christ. No man can call Christ Lord, with believing dependence upon him, unless that faith is wrought by the Holy Ghost. No man could believe with his heart, or prove by a miracle, that Jesus was Christ, unless by the Holy Ghost. There are various gifts, and various offices to perform, but all proceed from one God, one Lord, one Spirit; that is, from the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, the origin of all spiritual blessings. No man has them merely for himself. The more he profits others, the more will they turn to his own account. The gifts mentioned appear to mean exact understanding, and uttering the doctrines of the Christian religion; the knowledge of mysteries, and skill to give advice and counsel. Also the gift of healing the sick, the working of miracles, and to explain Scripture by a peculiar gift of the Spirit, and ability to speak and interpret languages. If we have any knowledge of the truth, or any power to make it known, we must give all the glory of God. The greater the gifts are, the more the possessor is exposed to temptations, and the larger is the measure of grace needed to keep him humble and spiritual; and he will meet with more painful experiences and humbling dispensations. We have little cause to glory in any gifts bestowed on us, or to despise those who have them not.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Ye know ... - This verse is regarded by many as a parenthesis. But it is not necessary to suppose that it is so, or that it does not cohere with that which follows. The design seems to be to remind them of their former miserable condition as idolaters, in order to make them more sensible of their advantages as Christians, and that they might be led more highly to appreciate their present condition. Paul often refers Christians to their former condition, to excite in them gratitude for the mercies that God has conferred on them in the gospel; see the note at <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-11.htm">1 Corinthians 6:11</a>, compare <a href="/romans/6-17.htm">Romans 6:17</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/2-11.htm">Ephesians 2:11-12</a>; <a href="/titus/3-3.htm">Titus 3:3</a>.<p>That ye were Gentiles - Heathen; worshippers of idols.

The whole system made an appeal to the senses, and "bore along" its votaries as if by a foreign and irresistible impulse.

The ancient priests and politicians deluded the people with the notion that oracles were uttered by the idols whom they worshipped, and thus they maintained the belief in their divinity. The idea of Patti here seems to be:<p>(1) That their idols never could have uttered the oracles which were ascribed to them, and consequently that they had been deluded.<p>(2) that these idols could never have endowed them with such spiritual privileges as they now had, and consequently that their present state was far preferable to their former condition.<p>Even as ye were led - Were led by the priests in the temples of the idols. They were under strong delusions and the arts of cunning and unprincipled people. The idea is, that they had been under a strong infatuation, and were entirely at the control of their spiritual leaders - a description remarkably applicable now to all forms of imposture in the world, No system of paganism consults the freedom and independence of the mind of man; but it is everywhere characterized as a system of "power," and not of "thought;" and all its arrangements are made to secure that power without an intelligent assent of the understanding and the heart. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2.

This the apostle observes to humble them, by putting them in mind of what they had been formerly; they were born and brought up in the Heathen religion, when they knew not the true God, much less had any knowledge of Christ, and still less of the Spirit of God; and therefore if they were favoured with any of his gifts, these must be owing to his grace, and not to their deserts, and therefore they ought not to glory: he adds, with the same view, <p>carried away unto these dumb idols; to idols that were nothing in the world, had no divinity in them, as he had before asserted; to dumb ones, that had mouths, but could not speak, the oracles that were delivered from them, being spoken not by them, but were either satanical delusions, or the jugglings of a priest; to these they were carried by the power of Satan, the influence of their priests, and the orders of their magistrates, to consult them as oracles, to pay their devotions to them, and do them service: <p>even as ye were led; that is, to these dumb idols; the Syriac adds, , "without any difference", not being able to distinguish between these and the true God; and to whom they were led as brute beasts were, that were sacrificed unto them, or as blind men are led by the blind, as they were by their blind and ignorant priests; and therefore, if they had now received the Spirit, and his gifts, they ought to ascribe the whole to the free grace of God, and be humble under a sense of their unworthiness. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_corinthians/12.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{2}</span> Ye know that ye were <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led.</span><p>(2) He reproves the same by comparing their former state with that in which they were at this time, being endued with those excellent gifts.<p>(b) As touching God's service and the covenant, mere strangers.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/1_corinthians/12.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/1_corinthians/12-2.htm" title="You know that you were Gentiles, carried away to these dumb idols, even as you were led.">1 Corinthians 12:2</a>.

And how <span class="ital">strange</span> the choice of the compound <span class="greekheb">ἀνήγεσθε</span>, since it does not (as Hofmann supposes) convey the notion of <span class="ital">whither</span> (which is expressed by <span class="greekheb">πρός</span>), but that of <span class="ital">upward</span>, as <span class="greekheb">ἀνάγειν</span> always means to lead <span class="ital">up</span>! The <span class="greekheb">τέ</span>, too, after <span class="greekheb">οἶδα</span>, would not be suitable even in a <span class="ital">logical</span> point of view (see note on ver. 3).—Laurent, in his <span class="ital">neut. Stud.</span> p. 132, agrees with Hofmann in so far that he also reads <span class="greekheb">ὡς ἀνήγεσθε</span> instead of <span class="greekheb">ὡς ἂν ἤγεσθε</span>. For the rest, he retains <span class="greekheb">οἴδατε</span>, and neither reads <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span> nor <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὅτε</span>, but simply <span class="greekheb">ὅτε</span>, which is supported by very slender evidence.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1920] .<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. <span class="greekheb">καὶ τὰ λοιπά</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1921] <span class="ital">l.</span> and others; and other passages; and other editions.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1922] <span class="ital">d</span> refers to the note of the commentator or editor named on the particular passage.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1923] <span class="ital">d</span> refers to the note of the commentator or editor named on the particular passage.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/1_corinthians/12.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/1_corinthians/12-2.htm" title="You know that you were Gentiles, carried away to these dumb idols, even as you were led.">1 Corinthians 12:2</a>. On the critical reading, <span class="greekheb">οἴδατε ὅτι ὅτε ἔθνη ἦτε</span> … <span class="greekheb">ὡς ἂν ἤγεσθε ἀπαγόμενοι</span>, there are two plausible constructions: (<span class="ital">a</span>) that of Bg[1815], Bm[1816] (pp. 383 f.), Ed[1817], who regard <span class="greekheb">ὡς</span> as a resumption of the <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span>, after the parenthetical <span class="greekheb">ὅτε</span> clause, and thus translate: “You know that, when you were Gentiles,—how you were always led to those voiceless idols, being carried away”. There are two reasons against this construction—(1) the improbability of <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span> being forgotten after so short an interruption; (2) the inversion of the proper relation between <span class="greekheb">ὡς ἂν ἤγεσθε</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἀπαγόμενοι</span>, the former of which is naturally construed as subordinate and adverbial to the latter, the “leading to idols”supplying the condition under which the “carrying off” took place. (<span class="ital">b</span>) We are driven back upon the alternative construction, adopted by Est., Mr[1818], Hn[1819], Ev[1820], Bt[1821], Gd[1822], El[1823] (see his note, and Krüger’s <span class="ital">Sprachl</span>., § 354 <span class="ital">b</span>, <span class="ital">Anm</span>. 1 f., for similar instances), who regard <span class="greekheb">ἀπαγόμεμοι</span> as chief predicate after <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span>, and complete the ptp[1824] by <span class="greekheb">ἦτε</span>, which is mentally taken up from the interposed temporal clause: “You know that, when you were Gentiles, to those voiceless idols, however you might be led, (you were) carried away”. Since <span class="greekheb">οἶδα</span> <span class="ital">with ptpl. complement</span> occurs but once besides in N.T. (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-2.htm" title="I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knows;) such an one caught up to the third heaven.">2 Corinthians 12:2</a>, and there with <span class="ital">acc</span>. ptp[1825], not nom[1826] as here), the confusion between the ptpl[1827] construction and the <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span> construction after <span class="greekheb">οἶδα</span>, by which Mr[1828] accounts for the grammatical irregularity, is not very probable. The emendation of W.H[1829] (see txtl. note) is most tempting, in view of <a href="/ephesians/2-11.htm" title="Why remember, that you being in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the Circumcision in the flesh made by hands;">Ephesians 2:11</a>; it wholly obviates the difficulty of grammar: “You know that <span class="ital">once</span> (<span class="greekheb">ὅτι ποτέ</span>) you were Gentiles, carried off to those dumb idols, howsoever you might be led”.—The Cor[1830], now belonging to the <span class="greekheb">λαὸς Θεοῦ</span>, distinguish themselves from the <span class="greekheb">ἔθνη</span> (see <a href="/1_corinthians/5-1.htm" title="It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife.">1 Corinthians 5:1</a>, <a href="/1_corinthians/10-20.htm" title="But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that you should have fellowship with devils.">1 Corinthians 10:20</a>); to be “led away to the (worship of the) idols” is the characteristic of Gentiles (<a href="/1_corinthians/8-7.htm" title="However, there is not in every man that knowledge: for some with conscience of the idol to this hour eat it as a thing offered to an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled.">1 Corinthians 8:7</a>). <span class="greekheb">ἀπάγω</span> implies <span class="ital">force</span> rather than charm in the <span class="greekheb">ἀπάγων</span>; P. is not thinking of any earlier truth <span class="ital">from</span> which the heathen were enticed, but of the overwhelming current by which they were “carried off” (<span class="ital">abreptos</span>, Bz[1831]), <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/2_corinthians/4-4.htm" title="In whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine to them.">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>, <a href="/2_timothy/2-26.htm" title="And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.">2 Timothy 2:26</a>, <a href="/matthew/12-29.htm" title="Or else how can one enter into a strong man's house, and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong man? and then he will spoil his house.">Matthew 12:29</a>. With this agrees the qualifying <span class="greekheb">ὡς ἂν ἤγεσθε</span> (not <span class="greekheb">ἀνήγεσθε</span>, as Hf[1832] and Hn[1833] read; this gives an irrelevant sense—“led up,” “led in sacrifice”), indicating the uncertainty and caprice of the directing powers—“pro nutu ducentium” (Est.).

Therefore the principal meaning will remain, if <span class="greekheb">ὠς ἄν</span> be entirely put aside by itself (parenthetically) in the construction, as in <a href="/2_corinthians/10-9.htm" title="That I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters.">2 Corinthians 10:9</a> [<span class="greekheb">ἵνα μὴ δόξω ὡς ἄν ἐκφοβεῖν ὑμᾶς</span>], where it signifies as if; and so it might be taken in this passage: nor even is <span class="greekheb">ἄν</span> easily construed with an indicative, such as <span class="greekheb">ἤγεσθε</span> is. Moreover in <span class="greekheb">ἤγεσθε ἀπαγόμενοι</span>, the passive is construed with the middle, the simple with the compound; you were led and led away, you gave yourselves up to any guidance whatever. The Scholium of Chrysostom amounts almost to this [is much the same as this]: though that Scholium has been censured by later writers without a cause; <span class="greekheb">οἴδατε</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὅτε Ἕλληνες ἦτε</span>, <span class="greekheb">πῶς ἀπήγεσθε</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἑλκόμενοι τότε</span>, ye know, when ye were Greeks, how you were led, being at that time drawn away.
