The Apostles were those selected by our Lord Himself, or afterwards elected by them to join that body. (On prophets and teachers, see <a href="/1_corinthians/12-10.htm" title="To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues:">1Corinthians 12:10</a>.) The teachers were probably a junior order of instructors. (See <a href="/acts/13-1.htm" title="Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers; as Barnabas, and Simeon that was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, which had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.">Acts 13:1</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-11.htm" title="And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;">Ephesians 4:11</a>.) The enumeration of the gifts here corresponds with that previously given in <a href="/context/1_corinthians/12-9.htm" title="To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit;">1Corinthians 12:9-10</a>, with the exception of the mention here of “helps” and “governments,” and the omission of “interpretation of tongues” and “discernment of spirit.” Possibly, therefore, the words inserted here are only another designation of the same thing. The “helps” being the aid required for those who heard tongues in order to the understanding them, and the “governments” being the due regulation of the acceptance of certain spiritual powers and rejection of others.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_corinthians/12.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/1_corinthians/12-27.htm" title="Now you are the body of Christ, and members in particular.">1 Corinthians 12:27</a></span>. <span class="ital">Now ye </span>— Believers at Corinth; <span class="ital">are the body of Christ </span>— A part of it, not the whole body; <span class="ital">and members in particular </span>— That is, each believer is a particular member thereof, and ought to behave himself accordingly. This is the application of the foregoing allegory, which the apostle is thought by some to have formed on our Lord’s words, <a href="/context/matthew/25-35.htm" title="For I was an hungered, and you gave me meat: I was thirsty, and you gave me drink: I was a stranger, and you took me in:...">Matthew 25:35-45</a>.

They were therefore to attend to the things he had written, that there might be no envy among them, nor discontent, nor arrogant preferring of themselves before others, but that in peace and love they might all promote each other’s happiness.” — Macknight.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/12.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>12:27-31 Contempt, hatred, envy, and strife, are very unnatural in Christians. It is like the members of the same body being without concern for one another, or quarrelling with each other. The proud, contentious spirit that prevailed, as to spiritual gifts, was thus condemned. The offices and gifts, or favours, dispensed by the Holy Spirit, are noticed. Chief ministers; persons enabled to interpret Scripture; those who laboured in word and doctrine; those who had power to heal diseases; such as helped the sick and weak; such as disposed of the money given in charity by the church, and managed the affairs of the church; and such as could speak divers languages. What holds the last and lowest rank in this list, is the power to speak languages; how vain, if a man does so merely to amuse or to exalt himself! See the distribution of these gifts, not to every one alike, ver. 29,30. This were to make the church all one, as if the body were all ear, or all eye. The Spirit distributes to every one as he will. We must be content though we are lower and less than others. We must not despise others, if we have greater gifts. How blessed the Christian church, if all the members did their duty! Instead of coveting the highest stations, or the most splendid gifts, let us leave the appointment of his instruments to God, and those in whom he works by his providence. Remember, those will not be approved hereafter who seek the chief places, but those who are most faithful to the trust placed in them, and most diligent in their Master's work.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Now ye - Ye Christians of Corinth, as a part of the whole church that has been redeemed.<p>Are the body of Christ - The allusion to the human body is here kept up. As all the members of the human body compose one body, having a common head, so it is with all the members and parts of the Christian church. The specific idea is, that Christ is the Head of the whole church; that he presides over all; and that all its members sustain to each other the relation of fellow-members in the same body, and are subject to the same head; compare the note at <a href="/1_corinthians/11-3.htm">1 Corinthians 11:3</a>.

Some think ek merouv signifies in part, intending that true believers amongst them were members of Christ, but not others. The apostle, in these words, beginneth to apply to them what he had before discoursed concerning the body natural, and the parts thereof; you are the mystical body of Christ, which hath a great analogy with that natural body which you carry about with you. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_corinthians/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Now ye are the body of Christ,.... Not his natural body, which his Father prepared for him, in which he bore our sins on the tree, and which was offered up once for all; nor his sacramental body, or the bread in the supper, which is a representation of his body; but his body mystical, the church; not that the Corinthians were the whole of the body, only a part of it, as every single congregational church is of the church universal. This is an accommodation of the simile the apostle had to so much advantage enlarged upon: <p>and members in particular; or in part: meaning either that they as single members were part of the general body: or that only a part of them were so, there being some among them, as in all particular and visible churches, who had not the true grace of God; and so are neither members of Christ, nor of the general assembly and church of the firstborn: or the sense is, that they were not only members of Christ, and of his body, but were particularly members one of another, in strict union and close communion, and of mutual use and service to each other. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_corinthians/12.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in <span class="cverse3">{s}</span> particular.</span><p>(s) For all churches, wherever they are dispersed through the whole world, are different members of one body.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/1_corinthians/12.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/1_corinthians/12-27.htm" title="Now you are the body of Christ, and members in particular.">1 Corinthians 12:27</a>.

In each Christian church the (ideal) body of Christ presents itself, as in each is presented the (ideal) temple of God; but each church is not a separate body of Christ; hence, just as with the idea of the temple (see on <a href="/1_corinthians/3-16.htm" title="Know you not that you are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?">1 Corinthians 3:16</a>), we must keep entirely away from us the conception of a plurality, as if the churches were <span class="greekheb">σώματα Χριστοῦ</span>, and understand <span class="greekheb">σῶμα Χριστοῦ</span> not as <span class="ital">a body</span>,[2006] but as <span class="ital">body</span> of Christ, the expression without the article being <span class="ital">qualitative</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Now if the church, as a whole, is Christ’s <span class="ital">body</span>, then the individuals in it are Christ’s <span class="ital">members</span> (comp <a href="/1_corinthians/6-15.htm" title="Know you not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot?
