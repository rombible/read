Thus the thought grows more naturally out of the previous chapter than it seems to do in the English version. He had mentioned his solemn resolve to give up a freedom to which he had a right in regard to eating meat. He had on another occasion, in regard to his right of maintenance by the Church, also voluntarily sacrificed his freedom, and the Jewish party had in consequence denied the existence of the rights, and questioned his apostolic dignity. He asks, with abrupt emphasis, “Was it because I am not free to demand such support? My freedom in this case is as real as in that other case when you questioned it, and to which I shall now refer. Was it because I am not an Apostle?”<p><span class= "bld">Have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord</span>?<span class= "ital">—</span>To have seen Christ was a necessary qualification for the Apostolate (<a href="/acts/1-21.htm" title="Why of these men which have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,">Acts 1:21</a>). From the manner in which the Apostle here asks the question, and does not answer it, it would seem that although some small minority might, for some party purpose, have at some time questioned it, yet that the fact was generally admitted and universally known that St. Paul did actually see the Lord at the time of his conversion (<a href="/acts/9-4.htm" title="And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying to him, Saul, Saul, why persecute you me?">Acts 9:4</a>), and on other occasions (<a href="/acts/18-9.htm" title="Then spoke the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not your peace:">Acts 18:9</a>; <a href="/acts/22-17.htm" title="And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem, even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance;">Acts 22:17</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Are not</span> <span class= "bld">ye</span> <span class= "bld">my work in the Lord?</span>—This is a further proof of his Apostleship, and therefore of his right or freedom to have demanded support from the Church.

Hence, after deciding some very difficult questions, which the Corinthians had proposed to him, and particularly after affirming, in the end of chap. 7., that he had decided these questions by the inspiration of the Spirit; and after showing himself a faithful apostle of Christ, by declaring, in the end of the last chapter, his resolution on all occasions to abstain from things indifferent, rather than, by using his liberty respecting them, to lead his fellow-Christians into sin; he with great propriety introduces the proof of his apostleship, and answers all the objections and calumnies whereby his enemies endeavoured to discredit him in the eyes of the Corinthians. <span class="ital">Am I not </span>— As truly as any man living; <span class="ital">an apostle? </span>— Divinely appointed and commissioned by the Lord Jesus? <span class="ital">Am I not free </span>— To act as I think best, with regard to receiving a maintenance from those to whom I minister or not?

To the cavils of some, the apostle answers, so as to set forth himself as an example of self-denial, for the good of others. He had a right to marry as well as other apostles, and to claim what was needful for his wife, and his children if he had any, from the churches, without labouring with his own hands to get it. Those who seek to do our souls good, should have food provided for them. But he renounced his right, rather than hinder his success by claiming it. It is the people's duty to maintain their minister. He may wave his right, as Paul did; but those transgress a precept of Christ, who deny or withhold due support.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Am I not an apostle? - This was the point to be settled; and it is probable that some at Corinth had denied that he could be an apostle, since it was requisite, in order to that, to have seen the Lord Jesus; and since it was supposed that Paul had not been a witness of his life, doctrines, and death.<p>Am I not free? - Am I not a free man; have I not the liberty which all Christians possess, and especially which all the apostles possess? The "liberty" referred to here is doubtless the privilege or right of abstaining from labor; of enjoying as others did the domestic relations of life; and of a support as a public minister and apostle. Probably some had objected to his claims of apostleship that he had not used this right, and that he was conscious that he had no claim to it. By this mode of interrogation, he strongly implies that he was a freeman, and that he had this right.<p>Have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? - Here it is implied, and seems to be admitted by Paul, that in order to be an "apostle" it was necessary to have seen the Saviour. This is often declared expressly; see the note at <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/1-21.htm">Acts 1:21-22</a>. The reason of this was, that the apostles were appointed to be witnesses of the life, doctrines, death, and resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and that in their "being witnesses" consisted the uniqueness of the apostolic office. That this was the case is abundantly manifest from <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18-19</a>; <a href="/luke/24-48.htm">Luke 24:48</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/1-21.htm">Acts 1:21-22</a>; <a href="/acts/2-32.htm">Acts 2:32</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/10-39.htm">Acts 10:39-41</a>. Hence, it was essential, in order that anyone should be such a witness, and an apostle, that he should have seen the Lord Jesus. In the case of Paul, therefore, who was called to this office after the death and resurrection of the Saviour, and who had not therefore had an opportunity of seeing and hearing him when living, this was provided for by the fact that the Lord Jesus showed himself to him after his death and ascension, in order that he might have this qualification for the apostolic office, <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/9-3.htm">Acts 9:3-5</a>, <a href="/acts/9-17.htm">Acts 9:17</a>. To the fact of his having been thus in a miraculous manner qualified for the apostolic office, Paul frequently appeals, and always with the same view that it was necessary to have seen the Lord Jesus to qualify one for this office, <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/22-14.htm">Acts 22:14-15</a>; <a href="/acts/26-16.htm">Acts 26:16</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-8.htm">1 Corinthians 15:8</a>. It follows from this, therefore, that no one was an apostle in the strict and proper sense who had not seen the Lord Jesus. And it follows, also, that the apostles could have no successors in that which constituted the uniqueness of their office; and that the office must have commenced and ended with them.<p>Are not ye my work in the Lord? - Have you not been converted by my labors, or under my ministry; and are you not a proof that the Lord, when I have been claiminG to be an apostle, has owned me "as an apostle," and blessed me in this work? God would not give his sanction to an impostor, and a false pretender; and as Paul had labored there as an apostle, this was an argument that he had been truly commissioned of God. A minister may appeal to the blessing of God on his labors in proof that he is sent of Him. And one of the best of all arguments that a man is sent from God exists where multitudes of souls are converted from sin, and turned to holiness, by his labors. What better credentials than this can a man need that he is in the employ of God? What more consoling to his own mind? What more satisfactory to the world? <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 9<p>1Co 9:1-27.

In Ac 9:7, 17 the contrast between "the men with him seeing no man," and "Jesus that appeared unto thee in the way," shows that Jesus actually appeared to him in going to Damascus. His vision of Christ in the temple (Ac 22:17) was "in a trance." To be a witness of Christ's resurrection was a leading function of an apostle (Ac 1:22).

That it is our duty to abate of our liberty, when we see we cannot use it without harm to other Christians. And here he proposeth to them his own example, who had restrained himself in three things, to two of which he had a liberty, and yet avoided it, and that not to prevent their sinning, but only their suffering, and that, too, only by being by him over-burdened: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

The Syriac, Ethiopic, and Vulgate Latin versions, put the last clause first; so the Alexandrian copy, and some other copies; and many interpreters are of opinion that it is the best order of the words; the apostle proceeding by a gradation from the less to the greater, having respect either to his freedom in the use of things indifferent, as eating of meats, &amp;c. for though he did not think fit to use his liberty, to the wounding of weak consciences, it did not follow therefore that he was not free, as some might suggest from what he had said in the latter part of the foregoing chapter: or he may have respect to his freedom from the ceremonial law in general; for though, for the sake of gaining souls to Christ, he became all things to all men; to the Jews he became a Jew, that he might gain them; yet in such a manner as to preserve his liberty in Christ, without entangling himself with the yoke of bondage. Some have thought he intends, by his liberty, his right to insist upon a maintenance, and that he was no more obliged to work with his hands than other persons, of which he treats at large hereafter; but to me it rather seems that the words stand in their right order; and that, whereas there were some persons that either denied him to be an apostle, or at least insinuated that he was not one, nor was he to be treated as such, he goes upon the proof of it; and the first thing he mentions is his freedom, that is, from men; no man had any authority over him; he was not taught, nor sent forth, nor ordained by men as a minister, but immediately by Jesus Christ, as apostles were; they were set in the first place in the church, and had power to instruct, send forth, and ordain others; but none had power over them; and this being the apostle's case, proved him to be one; he was an apostle, because he was free: <p>have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? He had a spiritual sight of him by faith, but that did not show him to be an apostle; this is what he had in common with other believers: whether he saw him in the flesh, before his crucifixion and death, is not certain; it is very probable he might; yet this was no more than what Herod and Pontius Pilate did; but he saw him after his resurrection from the dead, to which he refers, <a href="/1_corinthians/15-8.htm">1 Corinthians 15:8</a> and designs here, as a proof of his apostleship, this being what the apostles were chosen to be eyewitnesses of, <a href="/acts/10-41.htm">Acts 10:41</a> and publish to the world: now our apostle saw him several times; first at the time of his conversion, next when in a trance at Jerusalem, and again in the castle where the chief captain put him for security, and very probably also when he was caught up into the third heaven: <p>are not you my work in the Lord? as they were regenerated, converted persons, and were become new creatures; not efficiently, but instrumentally; they were God's workmanship, as he was the efficient cause of their conversion and faith; his only, as an instrument by whom they believed; and therefore he adds, "in the Lord"; ascribing the whole to his power and grace: however, as he had been the happy instrument of first preaching the Gospel to them, and of begetting them again through it; of founding and raising such a large flourishing church as they were; it was no inconsiderable proof of his apostleship. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_corinthians/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Am <span class="cverse3">{1}</span> I not an apostle? am I not free? <span class="cverse3">{2}</span> have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are not ye <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> my work in the Lord?</span><p>(1) Before he proceeds any further in his purposed matter of things offered to idols, he would show the cause of all this evil, and also take it away. That is, that the Corinthians thought that they did not have to depart from the least amount of their liberty for any man's pleasure. Therefore he propounds himself for an example, and that in a matter almost necessary. And yet he speaks of both, but first of his own person. If (he says) you allege for yourselves that you are free, and therefore will use your liberty, am I not also free, seeing I am an apostle?<p>(2) He proves his apostleship by the effects, in that he was appointed by Christ himself, and the authority of his function was sufficiently confirmed to him among them by their conversion. And all these things he sets before their eyes, to make them ashamed because they would not in the least way that might be, debase themselves for the sake of the weak, whereas the apostle himself did all the he could to win them to God, when they were utterly reprobate and without God.<p>(a) By the Lord.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/1_corinthians/9.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/1_corinthians/9-1.htm" title="Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are not you my work in the Lord?">1 Corinthians 9:1</a>.

The reference here is not to his having seen Christ <span class="ital">in His earthly life</span>, which would have had nothing to do with his apostleship, and which, moreover, cannot be proved to have taken place in the case of Paul at all,—certainly not from <a href="/2_corinthians/5-16.htm" title="Why from now on know we no man after the flesh: yes, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now from now on know we him no more.">2 Corinthians 5:16</a>,—but to the sight of the <span class="ital">glorified Jesus</span>, which was first vouchsafed near Damascus to call him to be an apostle (<a href="/acts/9-17.htm" title="And Ananias went his way, and entered into the house; and putting his hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord, even Jesus, that appeared to you in the way as you came, has sent me, that you might receive your sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost.">Acts 9:17</a>; <a href="/acts/22-14.htm" title="And he said, The God of our fathers has chosen you, that you should know his will, and see that Just One, and should hear the voice of his mouth.">Acts 22:14</a> f., <a href="/acts/26-16.htm" title="But rise, and stand on your feet: for I have appeared to you for this purpose, to make you a minister and a witness both of these things which you have seen, and of those things in the which I will appear to you;">Acts 26:16</a>; <a href="/acts/15-8.htm" title="And God, which knows the hearts, bore them witness, giving them the Holy Ghost, even as he did to us;">Acts 15:8</a>), and was often repeated afterwards, although in different forms (<a href="/acts/18-9.htm" title="Then spoke the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not your peace:">Acts 18:9</a>; <a href="/acts/22-17.htm" title="And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem, even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance;">Acts 22:17</a> f.; <a href="/2_corinthians/12-1.htm" title="It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory.

The rendering: <span class="ital">by the help of the Lord</span>, is arbitrary, and does not suit the context.

See against this Räbiger, p. 128 f. According to Schenkel, the allusion is to the visions of the Christ-party (the existence of which he has first of all to assume). The true view is, that Paul is here indicating how, in respect of this point also, he stands in no whit behind the original apostles. <span class="greekheb">Ἐπειδὴ μετὰ τὴν ἀνάληψιν τοῦ σωτῆρος ἐκλήθη</span>, <span class="greekheb">εἶχον δὲ δόξαν οἱ ἀκόστολοι παρὰ πᾶσι μεγίστην ὡς τῆς τοῦ Κυρίου θεάς ἠξιωμένοι</span>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ τοῦτο προστέθεικεν</span>, Theodoret.

He is “free” as any man in Cor[1274] in such respects; more than this, he is “an apostle” (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-1.htm" title="Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are not you my work in the Lord?">1 Corinthians 9:1</a>), and the Church of Cor[1275] is witness to the fact, being itself his answer to all challengers (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-2.htm" title="If I be not an apostle to others, yet doubtless I am to you: for the seal of my apostleship are you in the Lord.">1 Corinthians 9:2</a> f.).

St Paul’s Defence of his Apostolic Authority<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">1</span>. <span class="ital">Am I not an apostle? am I not free?</span>] This chapter is devoted to a defence of the Apostolic authority of St Paul, but there is an under-current of thought connecting it with the last which may easily be missed. In ch. 8. St Paul has been exhorting the Corinthians to sacrifice their own personal predilections for the benefit of others. In <a href="/1_corinthians/9-13.htm" title="Do you not know that they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple? and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar?">1 Corinthians 9:13</a> he declares himself to be ready to act upon this principle to the uttermost. But some may say, “Fine doctrine this, but does the Apostle practise what he preaches?” Robertson. He is about to give a proof of his sincerity by referring to his sacrifice of self for the good of others, when he anticipates in his mind the reply, You have no power to do otherwise: you are not an Apostle at all; and he replies to each of these statements in his usual fervid way, by asking of each of them, Is it really then true? This connection of ideas is strengthened if with the majority of MSS. and the Syriac and Vulgate versions (so Wiclif, <span class="ital">Whethir I am not free? am I not Apostle?</span>) we transpose the two clauses, and read, “<span class="ital">Am I not free? am I not an Apostle?</span> The argument is admirably summarized by Bp Wordsworth thus: “Am I not free? Am I not an Apostle? Am I not <span class="ital">your</span> Apostle?”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord?</span>] One distinction drawn by St Paul’s opponents between him and the other Apostles was that they had seen and associated with Christ, while he had not. He rebuts this in the form of a question. He <span class="ital">had</span> seen the Lord (1) in the way to Damascus (<a href="/acts/9-3.htm" title="And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus: and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven:">Acts 9:3</a>; <a href="/acts/9-17.htm" title="And Ananias went his way, and entered into the house; and putting his hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord, even Jesus, that appeared to you in the way as you came, has sent me, that you might receive your sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost.">Acts 9:17</a>); (2) after his return to Jerusalem (<a href="/acts/22-17.htm" title="And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem, even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance;">Acts 22:17</a>, cf. <a href="/1_corinthians/9-14.htm" title="Even so has the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel.">1 Corinthians 9:14</a> of the same chapter, and <a href="/acts/9-26.htm" title="And when Saul was come to Jerusalem, he assayed to join himself to the disciples: but they were all afraid of him, and believed not that he was a disciple.">Acts 9:26</a>; <a href="/galatians/1-18.htm" title="Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and stayed with him fifteen days.">Galatians 1:18</a>); (3) <span class="ital">at Corinth itself</span> (<a href="/acts/18-9.htm" title="Then spoke the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not your peace:">Acts 18:9</a>, where observe that the Greek word does not signify dream, since it is used of the burning bush in <a href="/acts/7-31.htm" title="When Moses saw it, he wondered at the sight: and as he drew near to behold it, the voice of the LORD came to him,">Acts 7:31</a> as well as of the transfiguration in St <a href="/matthew/17-9.htm" title="And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying, Tell the vision to no man, until the Son of man be risen again from the dead.">Matthew 17:9</a>); (4) on some occasion not specified (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-1.htm" title="It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory.

Being free and an apostle, he could, if he had chosen, have claimed, as others had done, a right to be supported by the Churches to which he preached, he had thought it more for their good to waive this claim, and therefore he had done so at the cost (as appears in many other passages: <a href="/1_corinthians/4-12.htm">1 Corinthians 4:12</a>; <a href="/acts/20-34.htm">Acts 20:34</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:9</a>) of bitter hardship to himself. But St. Paul practically "goes off" at the word "apostle." It was so essential for him to vindicate, against the subterranean malignity of hostile partisans, his dignity as an apostle, that in asserting that authority he almost loses sight for the time of the main object for which he had alluded to the fact. Hence much that he says is of the nature of a digression - though an important one - until he resumes the main thread of his subject at <a href="/1_corinthians/11-15.htm">1 Corinthians 11:15</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord?</span> Doubtless he mainly refers to the vision on the road to Damascus (<a href="/acts/9-3.htm">Acts 9:3, 17</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-8.htm">1 Corinthians 15:8</a>), though he received other visions and revelations also (<a href="/acts/18-9.htm">Acts 18:9</a>; <a href="/acts/22-14.htm">Acts 22:14, 18</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/12-1.htm">2 Corinthians 12:1</a>, etc.). he had probably not seen Christ during his life on earth (see my 'Life of St. Paul,' 1:73-75).
