Those spoken of as “Jews” are, of course, Jews by birth and religion; those “under the Law” are probably proselytes to Judaism. In neither case do they mean Christian converts, for the object of St. Paul’s conduct towards those of whom he here speaks was to win them to the Faith of Christ. He himself was no longer “under the Law” being a Christian (<a href="/galatians/2-19.htm" title="For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live to God.">Galatians 2:19</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_corinthians/9.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/1_corinthians/9-20.htm" title="And to the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law;...">1 Corinthians 9:20-23</a></span>. <span class="ital">To the Jews I became as a Jew — </span>Conforming myself in all things to their manner of living, so far as I could with innocence. And, inasmuch as in the preceding chapter the apostle directed the Corinthians to comply with the prejudices of their weak brethren, in the affair of meats sacrificed to idols, and declared his own resolution, that if his eating meat occasioned others to sin, he would not eat flesh while he lived; it is therefore probable that his becoming to the Jews as a Jew, implied especially that he observed the distinction of meats enjoined by Moses, while he lived with the Jews in the heathen countries. It may refer also to his circumcising Timothy, to render his preaching acceptable to the Jews. This compliance with the prejudices of the weak he showed only to gain their good-will, and thereby remove their prejudices against himself, and the cause in which he was engaged. For when the Judaizing teachers insisted on the observance of any of the rites of the law, as necessary to salvation, he always resolutely withstood them, as in the case of Titus, <a href="/galatians/2-3.htm" title="But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised:">Galatians 2:3</a>; <a href="/galatians/2-5.htm" title="To whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.">Galatians 2:5</a>; <a href="/galatians/2-14.htm" title="But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said to Peter before them all, If you, being a Jew, live after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compel you the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?">Galatians 2:14</a>. <span class="ital">To them that are under the law </span>— Who apprehend themselves to be still bound by the Mosaic law; <span class="ital">as under the law </span>— Observing it myself while I am among them.

But when a minister gives up his right for the sake of the gospel, he does more than his charge and office demands. By preaching the gospel, freely, the apostle showed that he acted from principles of zeal and love, and thus enjoyed much comfort and hope in his soul. And though he looked on the ceremonial law as a yoke taken off by Christ, yet he submitted to it, that he might work upon the Jews, do away their prejudices, prevail with them to hear the gospel, and win them over to Christ. Though he would transgress no laws of Christ, to please any man, yet he would accommodate himself to all men, where he might do it lawfully, to gain some. Doing good was the study and business of his life; and, that he might reach this end, he did not stand on privileges. We must carefully watch against extremes, and against relying on any thing but trust in Christ alone. We must not allow errors or faults, so as to hurt others, or disgrace the gospel.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And unto the Jews - In this verse, and the two following, Paul states more at length the conduct which he had exhibited, and to which he refers in <a href="/1_corinthians/9-19.htm">1 Corinthians 9:19</a>. He had shown this conduct to all classes of people. He had preached much to his own countrymen, and had evinnced these principles there.<p>I became as a Jew - I complied with their rites, customs, prejudices, as far as I could with a good conscience. I did not needlessly offend them. I did not attack and oppose their views, when there was no danger that my conduct should be mistaken. For a full illustration of Paul's conduct in this respect, and the principles which influenced him, see the notes on <a href="/acts/16-3.htm">Acts 16:3</a>; <a href="/acts/18-18.htm">Acts 18:18</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/21-21.htm">Acts 21:21-27</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/23-1.htm">Acts 23:1-6</a>.<p>To those that are under the law - This I understand as another form of saying that he conformed to the rites, customs, and even prejudices of the Jews. The phrase "under the law" means undoubtedly the law of Moses; and probably he here refers particularly to those Jews who lived in the land of Judea, as being more "immediately and entirely" under the law of Moses, than those who lived among the Gentiles.<p>As under the law - That is, I conformed to their rites and customs as far as I could do it. I did not violate them unnecessarily. I did not disregard them for the purpose of offending them; nor refuse to observe them when it could be done with a good conscience. There can be no doubt that Paul, when he was in Judea, submitted himself to the laws, and lived in conformity with them.<p>That I might gain - That I might obtain their confidence and affection. That I might not outrage their feelings, excite their prejudices, and provoke them to anger; and that I might thus have access to their minds, and be the means of converting them to the Christian faith. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20. I became as a Jew&#8212;in things not defined by the law, but by Jewish usage. Not Judaizing in essentials, but in matters where there was no compromise of principle (compare Ac 16:3; 21:20-26); an undesigned coincidence between the history and the Epistle, and so a sure proof of genuineness.<p>to them that are under the law, as under the law&#8212;in things defined by the law; such as ceremonies not then repugnant to Christianity. Perhaps the reason for distinguishing this class from the former is that Paul himself belonged nationally to "the Jews," but did not in creed belong to the class of "them that are under the law." This view is confirmed by the reading inserted here by the oldest manuscripts, versions, and Fathers, "not being (that is, parenthetically, 'not that I am') myself under the law."<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_corinthians/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The ceremonial law died with Christ, <span class="bld"><a href="/ephesians/2-15.htm" title="Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of two one new man, so making peace;">Ephesians 2:15</a>,16</span>, wherefore Christians were not obliged to the performance and observation of it after the death of Christ; but it pleased God for a time to indulge the Jews in the observance of those rites, until they could clearly see, and be fully persuaded of, their liberty from it, with which Christ had made them free; and it was some good time before all those, who from Judaism had turned to Christianity, could be thus persuaded, as we may learn from <span class="bld"><a href="/galatians/4-21.htm" title="Tell me, you that desire to be under the law, do you not hear the law?">Galatians 4:21</a></span>, they desired to be under the law.

In all this Paul did nothing that was sinful, but only determined himself as to the liberty which God had given him, when he might do or forbear, either doing or forbearing to do, as he saw the one or the other made most for the honour and glory of God in the winning of souls. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_corinthians/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And unto the Jews I became as a Jew,....
