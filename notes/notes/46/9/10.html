To the cavils of some, the apostle answers, so as to set forth himself as an example of self-denial, for the good of others. He had a right to marry as well as other apostles, and to claim what was needful for his wife, and his children if he had any, from the churches, without labouring with his own hands to get it. Those who seek to do our souls good, should have food provided for them. But he renounced his right, rather than hinder his success by claiming it. It is the people's duty to maintain their minister. He may wave his right, as Paul did; but those transgress a precept of Christ, who deny or withhold due support.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Or saith he it altogether for our sakes? - The word "altogether" (&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;  panto&#772;s) cannot mean that this was the "sole" and "only" design of the law, to teach that ministers of the gospel were entitled to support; for:<p>(1) This would be directly contrary to the law itself, which had some direct and undoubted reference to oxen;<p>(2) The scope of the argument here does not require this interpretation, since the whole object will be met by supposing that this settled a "principle" of humanity and equity in the divine law, according to which it was "proper" that ministers should have a support; and,<p>(3) The word "altogether" (&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;  panto&#772;s) does not of necessity require this interpretation. It may be rendered "chiefly, mainly, principally, or doubtless;" <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/4-23.htm">Luke 4:23</a>, "Ye will 'surely' (&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;  panto&#772;s certainly, surely, doubtless) say unto me this proverb," etc.; <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/18-21.htm">Acts 18:21</a>, "I must 'by all means' (&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;  panto&#772;s, certainly, surely) keep this feast; <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/21-22.htm">Acts 21:22</a>, "The multitude 'must needs' (&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;  panto&#772;s, will certainly, surely, inevitably) come together," etc.; <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/28-4.htm">Acts 28:4</a>, "'No doubt' (&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;  panto&#772;s) this man is a murderer," etc. The word here, therefore, means that the "principle" stated in the law about the oxen was so broad and humane, that it might "certainly, surely, particularly" be regarded as applicable to the case under consideration. An important and material argument might be drawn from it; an argument from the less to the greater. The precept enjoined justice, equity, humanity; and that was more applicable to the case of the ministers of the gospel than to the case of oxen.<p>For our sakes ... - To show that the laws and requirements of God are humane, kind, and equitable; not that Moses had Paul or any other minister in his eye, but the "principle" was one that applied particularly to this case.<p>That he that ploweth ... - The Greek in this place would be more literally and more properly rendered, "For (&#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;  hoti) he that ploweth ought (&#x3bf;&#787;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;  opheilei) to plow in hope;" that is, in hope of reaping a harvest, or of obtaining success in his labors; and the sense is, "The man who cultivates the earth, in order that he may be excited to industry and diligence, ought to have a reasonable prospect that he shall himself be permitted to enjoy the fruit of his labors. This is the case with those who do plow; and if this should be the case with those who cultivate the earth, it is as certainly reasonable that those who labor in God's husbandry, and who devote their strength to his service, should be encouraged with a reasonable prospect of success and support."<p>And that he that thresheth ... - This sentence, in the Greek, is very elliptical and obscure; but the sense is, evidently, "He that thresheth 'ought' to partake of his hope;" that is, of the fruits of his hope, or of the result of his labor. It is fair and right that he should enjoy the fruits of his toil. So in God's husbandry; it is right and proper that they who toil for the advancement of his cause should be supported and rewarded." The same sentiment is expressed in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-6.htm">2 Timothy 2:6</a>, "The husbandman that laboreth must be first partaker of the fruits." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. altogether&#8212;Join this with "saith."

Grotius, however, translates, "mainly" or "especially," instead of altogether.<p>that&#8212;"meaning that" [Alford]; literally, "because."<p>should plough&#8212;ought to plough in hope. The obligation rests with the people not to let their minister labor without remuneration.<p>he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope&#8212;The oldest manuscript versions and Fathers read, "He that thresheth (should or ought to thresh) in the hope of partaking" (namely, of the fruit of his threshing).

That is, God says this, or delivers out this law, forbidding the muzzling the ox, while it treads out the corn; not merely for the sake of the ox, but chiefly for the sake of men; and so Jarchi upon the place says, that the ox is mentioned,  , "to express man"; and so another of the Jewish writers (m) interprets the law in <a href="/deuteronomy/22-6.htm">Deuteronomy 22:6</a>. "Thou shalt not take the dam with the young"; <p>"the intention of the command is, not to have mercy on birds, "but for the sake of men", he (God) says this, whom he would accustom to meekness and compassion:'' <p>and particularly this is here said, for the sake of ministers of the Gospel, who for their spiritual strength, and labours in their work, may be compared to oxen; see <a href="/ezekiel/1-10.htm">Ezekiel 1:10</a>.

Nor is it simply an <span class="ital">application</span> of the <span class="ital">moral idea</span> of the precept to the spiritual work that the apostle would have his readers make; there is not the slightest trace of this in his words, but the material work serves directly as the <span class="ital">foil</span> to the spiritual.

Does God take care for oxen?">1 Corinthians 9:9</a> is here rendered threshing, because the usual Eastern mode of threshing corn was by means of oxen. See Art “Agriculture” in Smith’s <span class="ital">Dictionary of the Bible</span>, and Kitto’s <span class="ital">Biblical Cyclopædia</span>. The flail appears to nave been occasionally used for the lighter kinds of grain (<a href="/ruth/2-17.htm" title="So she gleaned in the field until even, and beat out that she had gleaned: and it was about an ephah of barley.">Ruth 2:17</a>), and threshing instruments are occasionally mentioned in the later books of the Old Testament, e.g. <a href="/2_samuel/24-22.htm" title="And Araunah said to David, Let my lord the king take and offer up what seems good to him: behold, here be oxen for burnt sacrifice, and threshing instruments and other instruments of the oxen for wood.">2 Samuel 24:22</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/21-23.htm" title="And Ornan said to David, Take it to you, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes: see, I give you the oxen also for burnt offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meat offering; I give it all.">1 Chronicles 21:23</a>; <a href="/isaiah/41-15.htm" title="Behold, I will make you a new sharp threshing instrument having teeth: you shall thresh the mountains, and beat them small, and shall make the hills as chaff.">Isaiah 41:15</a>. And (2) we find in many MSS. the reading ‘<span class="ital">that he that thresheth</span> may do so <span class="ital">in hope of partaking</span>.’ The text is in some confusion here.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/1_corinthians/9.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/1_corinthians/9-10.htm" title="Or said he it altogether for our sakes?

It seems to be an adage, something like this; hope supports the husbandman.—<span class="greekheb">τῆς ἐλπίδος ἀυτοῦ</span>,[74] <span class="ital">of his hope</span>) The abstract for the concrete: <span class="ital">of the fruits, in the hope of which</span> he, who now threshes, <span class="ital">plowed</span>,—<span class="greekheb">μετέχειν</span>, <span class="ital">to become partaker</span>) viz. <span class="ital">ought.
