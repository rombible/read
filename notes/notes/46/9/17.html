and now the writer proves the truth of his assertion—that the necessity of preaching the gospel deprives the mere act itself of any grounds of boasting—by showing that if there were no necessity there would be a ground of boasting. The argument is this:—Suppose it to be otherwise, and that there is no such necessity, then, by voluntarily undertaking it, I have a reward. The undertaking it of my own free will would entitle me to a reward. But if (as is the case) not of my free will, but of necessity, then I am merely a steward—a slave doing his duty (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-1.htm" title="Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.">1Corinthians 4:1</a>; <a href="/context/luke/17-7.htm" title="But which of you, having a servant plowing or feeding cattle, will say to him by and by, when he is come from the field, Go and sit down to meat?">Luke 17:7-10</a>).<p><span class= "bld">A dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">I am entrusted with a stewardship.</span><p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:15-23 It is the glory of a minister to deny himself, that he may serve Christ and save souls. But when a minister gives up his right for the sake of the gospel, he does more than his charge and office demands. By preaching the gospel, freely, the apostle showed that he acted from principles of zeal and love, and thus enjoyed much comfort and hope in his soul. And though he looked on the ceremonial law as a yoke taken off by Christ, yet he submitted to it, that he might work upon the Jews, do away their prejudices, prevail with them to hear the gospel, and win them over to Christ. Though he would transgress no laws of Christ, to please any man, yet he would accommodate himself to all men, where he might do it lawfully, to gain some. Doing good was the study and business of his life; and, that he might reach this end, he did not stand on privileges. We must carefully watch against extremes, and against relying on any thing but trust in Christ alone. We must not allow errors or faults, so as to hurt others, or disgrace the gospel.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For if I do this thing willingly - If I preach so as to show that my heart is in it; that I am not compelled, If I pursue such a course as to show that I prefer it to all other employments. If Paul took a compensation for his services, he could not well do this; if he did not, he showed that his heart was in it, and that he preferred the work to all others. Even though he had been in a manner compelled to engage in that work, yet he so acted in the work as to show that it had his hearty preference. This was done by his submitting to voluntary self-denials and sacrifices in order to spread the Saviour's name.<p>I have a reward - I shall meet with the approbation of my Lord, and shall obtain the reward in the world to come, which is promised to those who engage heartily, and laboriously, and successfully in turning sinners to God; <a href="/proverbs/11-30.htm">Proverbs 11:30</a>; <a href="/daniel/12-3.htm">Daniel 12:3</a>; <a href="/matthew/13-43.htm">Matthew 13:43</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/25-21.htm">Matthew 25:21-23</a>; <a href="/james/5-20.htm">James 5:20</a>.<p>But if against my will - (&#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;  ako&#772;n).

The work must be done; I must preach the gospel; and it becomes me so to do it as to show that my heart and will entirely concur; that it is not a matter of compulsion, but of choice. This he proposed to do by so denying himself, and so foregoing comforts which he might lawfully enjoy, and so subjecting himself to perils and toils in preaching the gospel, as to show that his heart was in the work, and that he truly loved it. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17.

The strength of the apostle’s argument seems to lie here: That no man can reasonably expect thanks, or any extraordinary reward, for doing what he is obliged by his snperior’s command under a great penalty to do. The apostle was obliged by such a precept, and under such penalties, to preach the gospel; therefore he desired not only to do it, but to do it willingly and readily, a greater testimony of which could not be, than for him to do it without desiring or expecting any reward for his pains, but what God of his free grace should give him; this made this matter of glorying to him, which he desired might not be in vain. So that though the word ekwn here be truly translated <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">willingly, </span> and opposed to akwn, which is as truly translated unwillingly, yet it seems to comprehend without charge, and taking nothing for his pains, as a demonstration of his willingness to and cheerful performance of his work; which being a thing as to which God had laid him under no necessity by any precept, was matter of glorying to him against the false apostles, who did otherwise; and also a ground for him to expect a greater reward from God, than those who, though they did the same work, yet did it not from the like free and cheerful spirit. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_corinthians/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For if I do this thing willingly,.... That is, not freely and without receiving anything for preaching, without seeking any temporal profits and advantages; nor in pure love to Christ, and the good of souls, without any fear of punishment, or hope of reward; but the apostle supposes a case which was not, and his sense is, that supposing no necessity had been laid upon him, or any injunction or command given him to preach the Gospel, but he had entered on it without any obligation upon him, then, says he, <p>I have a reward; or should have one, or might expect one; so the Jews (q) say, that a reward is given to him, who does anything unbidden: <p>but if against my will, or unwillingly, <p>a dispensation of the Gospel is committed to me; which was his case; the Gospel was committed to his trust, as anything is to the trust and charge of a steward by his lord, who is obliged to take care of it, and is accountable for it, and of whom faithfulness is required; he did not undertake this economy, or dispensation of the Gospel of himself, of his own mind and will, but it was enjoined him by one that had the command over him, and could and did oblige him to take the charge of it; though he made him willing, as well as able to do it: and therefore since this was the case, that it was not at his own option whether he would preach the Gospel or not, but he was obliged to it by one, that had a superior power and influence over him; hence, though he performed it ever so well, and with never so much faithfulness and integrity, he asks in the following verse, <p>(q) Maimon. apud Hammond in loc. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_corinthians/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my will, a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/1_corinthians/9.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/1_corinthians/9-17.htm" title="For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my will, a dispensation of the gospel is committed to me.">1 Corinthians 9:17</a> f.

Billroth, failing to recognise how essential <span class="greekheb">εἰ δὲ ἄκων</span>, <span class="greekheb">οἰκ</span>. <span class="greekheb">πεπίστ</span>. is to the argument, makes it parenthetical, and understands <span class="greekheb">ἄκων</span> (with Bengel, Zachariae, and Schulz) as meaning <span class="ital">non gratis</span>, which is contrary to the signification of the word. Many expositors render <span class="greekheb">ἑκών</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἄκων</span> by “<span class="ital">with joy and gladness</span>” and “<span class="ital">with reluctance</span>” (so Calovius, Piscator, Estius, Kypke, Rosenmüller, Flatt, Pott, <span class="ital">al</span>[1481]; comp also Ewald); but this runs counter to the fact that, as <span class="greekheb">τίς οὖν</span> … <span class="greekheb">μισθός</span> shows, the apostle’s own case is not the first, but the last of the two cases supposed by him, and that he found himself indeed in the official position of a preacher without having chosen it of his own free will,—being rather apprehended (<a href="/philippians/2-12.htm" title="Why, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.">Php 2:12</a>), and, through his call (<a href="/acts/9-22.htm" title="But Saul increased the more in strength, and confounded the Jews which dwelled at Damascus, proving that this is very Christ.">Acts 9:22</a>; <a href="/acts/9-26.htm" title="And when Saul was come to Jerusalem, he assayed to join himself to the disciples: but they were all afraid of him, and believed not that he was a disciple.">Acts 9:26</a>), as it were constrained by Christ (<span class="greekheb">ἐξ ἀνάγκης ἄκων</span>, Plato, <span class="ital">Legg.</span> v. 734 B),—but, notwithstanding, pursued his work with heart and hand.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">οἰκονομίαν πεπίστ</span>.] <span class="greekheb">οἰκον</span>. has significant emphasis; as to the construction, comp <a href="/romans/3-2.htm" title="Much every way: chiefly, because that to them were committed the oracles of God.">Romans 3:2</a>; <a href="/galatians/2-7.htm" title="But contrariwise, when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed to me, as the gospel of the circumcision was to Peter;">Galatians 2:7</a>. If I preach <span class="greekheb">ἄκων</span>, so Paul holds, then the apostleship, with which I am put in trust, stands in the relation of the <span class="ital">stewardship of a household</span> (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-1.htm" title="Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.">1 Corinthians 4:1</a>); for that, too, a man receives not from his own free choice, but by the master’s will, which he has to obey; and hence it follows (<span class="greekheb">οὖν</span>) that <span class="ital">no</span> reward awaits me (this being the negative sense of <span class="greekheb">τίς</span> … <span class="greekheb">μισθός</span>; comp <a href="/matthew/5-46.htm" title="For if you love them which love you, what reward have you? do not even the publicans the same?">Matthew 5:46</a>; <a href="/romans/6-21.htm" title="What fruit had you then in those things whereof you are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death.">Romans 6:21</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-32.htm" title="If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantages it me, if the dead rise not? let us eat and drink; for to morrow we die.">1 Corinthians 15:32</a>); for a steward—conceived of as a slave[1485]—can but do his duty (<a href="/luke/17-10.htm" title="So likewise you, when you shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done that which was our duty to do.">Luke 17:10</a>), whereas one who works of his own free will does more than he is bound to do, and so labours in a sense worthy of reward. The meanings which some expositors find in <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΟἸΚ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΠΕΠ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> are inserted by themselves; thus Pott explains, “nihilosecius peragendum est,” comp Schulz, Rosenmüller, Flatt, Schrader, Neander, and older interpreters; while Grotius makes it, “ratio mihi reddenda est impositi muneris.” The words convey nothing more than just their simple literal meaning. What, again, is <span class="ital">inferred</span> from them, Paul himself tells us by <span class="ital">beginning a new sentence</span> with <span class="greekheb">τίς οὖν</span>. To suppose a middle clause omitted before this sentence (with Neander, who would insert, “How am I now to prove that I do it of my own free will?”) is to make a purely arbitrary interruption in the passage.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ὁ ΜΙΣΘΌς</span></span></span>] <span class="ital">the befitting reward</span>. Neither here nor in the first clause is <span class="greekheb">μισθός</span> the same as <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΎΧΗΜΑ</span></span></span> (Pott, Rückert, Ewald, <span class="ital">al</span>[1487]); but it is viewed as standing in the relation of the inducing <span class="ital">cause</span> to that <span class="greekheb">ἐστί μοι καύχημα</span>, supposing the latter to take place. This also applies against Baur in the <span class="ital">theol. Jahrb.</span> 1852, p. 541 ff., who, moreover, pronounces the apostle’s argument an unsound one. The distinction which Paul here makes is, in his opinion, at variance with the absolute ground of obligation in the moral consciousness, and is either purely a piece of dialectics, or has for its real basis the idea of the <span class="ital">opera supererogationis</span>. In point of fact, neither the one nor the other is the case; but Paul is speaking of the <span class="ital">apostolic reward</span> hereafter, concerning which he was persuaded that it was not to be procured for him by his apostolic labour in itself, seeing that he had not, in truth, come to the apostleship of his own free will; rather, in his case, must the element of free self-determination come in in another way, namely, by his labouring without receiving anything in return. In so far, accordingly, he must do something more than the other apostles in order that he might receive the reward. He had recognised this to be his peculiar duty of love, incumbent upon him also with a view to avert all ground of offence, but not as implying surplus merit. The latter notion is discovered in the text by Cornelius a Lapide and others.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1473] .<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. <span class="greekheb">καὶ τὰ λοιπά</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1475] <span class="ital">d</span> refers to the note of the commentator or editor named on the particular passage.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1476] .<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. <span class="greekheb">καὶ τὰ λοιπά</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1477] On <span class="greekheb">μισθὸν ἔχειν</span>, comp. <a href="/matthew/6-1.htm" title="Take heed that you do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise you have no reward of your Father which is in heaven.">Matthew 6:1</a>.

It appears to be as follows: He has been speaking of the fact that he preaches at his own cost. He so glories in this that he would rather die than surrender this ground of boasting Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-7.htm">2 Corinthians 11:7-12</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-13.htm">2 Corinthians 12:13-16</a>. For it is the only ground of boasting that is possible to him. The preaching of the Gospel in itself furnishes no such ground, for one cannot boast of what he needs must do; and the necessity to preach the Gospel is laid on him under penalty of a "woe" if he refuse. He goes on to show, in two propositions, why and how there is no cause for boasting in preaching under necessity. 1. Supposing there were no necessity, but that he preached of free will, like the twelve who freely accepted the apostleship at Christ's call, then he would rightfully have a reward, as a free man entering freely upon service; and so would have some ground of glorying. 2. But supposing I became an apostle under constraint, as was the fact, then I am not in the position of a free man who chooses at will, but of a slave who is made household steward by his master's will, without his own choice, and consequently I have no claim for reward and no ground of boasting. What, then, is my reward? What ground of boasting have I? Only this: to make the Gospel without charge. In this I may glory.<p>Willingly - against my will (&#x3b5;&#788;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#768;&#x3bd;  - &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;)<p>These words are not to be explained of the spirit in which Paul fulfilled his ministry; but of his attitude toward the apostolic charge when it was committed to him.
