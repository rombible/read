Granting the existence of the rights established by the previous questions, the Apostle now says—still preserving the interrogative form—“These things being so, the only way you can possibly do away with this right is by making exceptions of myself and Barnabas.” The form in which the question is put shows the impossibility of any such arbitrary exception being made.

To the cavils of some, the apostle answers, so as to set forth himself as an example of self-denial, for the good of others. He had a right to marry as well as other apostles, and to claim what was needful for his wife, and his children if he had any, from the churches, without labouring with his own hands to get it. Those who seek to do our souls good, should have food provided for them. But he renounced his right, rather than hinder his success by claiming it. It is the people's duty to maintain their minister. He may wave his right, as Paul did; but those transgress a precept of Christ, who deny or withhold due support.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Or I only and Barnabas - Paul and Barnabas had worked together as tent-makers at Corinth; <a href="/acts/18-3.htm">Acts 18:3</a>. From this fact it had been inferred that they "knew" that they had no claim to a support.<p>Power to forbear working - To abstain from labor, and to receive support as others do. The question implies a strong affirmation that they had such power. The sense is, 'Why should I and Barnabas be regarded as having no right to support? Have we been less faithful than others? Have we done less? Have we given fewer evidences that we are sent by the Lord, or that God approves us in our work? Have we been less successful? Why then should we be singled out; and why should it be supposed that we are obliged to labor for our support? "Is there no other conceivable reason" why we should support ourselves than a consciousness that we have no right to support from the people with whom we labor?" It is evident from <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-12.htm">1 Corinthians 9:12</a>, that Barnabas as well as Paul relinquished his right to a support, and labored to maintain himself. And it is manifest from the whole passage, that there was some special "spleen" ("Doddridge") against these two ministers of the gospel. What it was we know not. It might have arisen from the enmity and opposition of Judaizing teachers, who were offended at their zeal and success among the Gentiles, and who could find no other cause of complaint against them than that they chose to support themselves, and not live in idleness, or to tax the church for their support. That must have been a bad cause which was sustained by such an argument. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. Barnabas&#8212;long the associate of Paul, and, like him, in the habit of self-denyingly forbearing to claim the maintenance which is a minister's right.

The apostle seems, in this, to imitate the ancient, wise, and holy men of his nation, who taught the law freely, and took nothing for it; not that they thought it was unlawful, or that they had no right to a maintenance on account of it, but for the honour of religion, and that piety they professed; and lest the law should be thought to be made a trade of, they chose not to insist upon it (d). <p>(d) Maimon. &amp; Bartenora in Pirke Abot, c. 4. sect. 5. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_corinthians/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to <span class="cverse3">{f}</span> forbear working?</span><p>(f) Not live by the works of our hands.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/1_corinthians/9.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/1_corinthians/9-6.htm" title="Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to forbear working?">1 Corinthians 9:6</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἤ</span>] <span class="ital">or</span>, i.e. <span class="ital">unless it were true that</span>, etc. In that case, indeed, the <span class="greekheb">ἐξουσία</span>, of which I spoke in <a href="/context/1_corinthians/9-4.htm" title="Have we not power to eat and to drink?...">1 Corinthians 9:4-5</a>, must of course be wanting!

If, then, St. Paul toiled at the dull, mechanical, despised, and ill paid work of tent making, he did so, not because it was, in the abstract, his duty to earn his own living, but because he chose to be nobly independent, that the absolute disinterestedness of his motives might be manifest to all the world. For this reason even when he was most in need he would never receive assistance from any Church except that of Philippi, where he had at least one wealthy convert, and where he was beloved with a peculiar warmth of affection. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/1_corinthians/9.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Barnabas<p>The only mention of Barnabas along with Paul since the quarrel, <a href="/acts/15-39.htm">Acts 15:39</a>.<p>Forbear working<p>For their own support. &#x395;&#788;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; to work, is the regular word for manual labor.
