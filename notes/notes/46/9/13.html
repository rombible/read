The rights of the ministry to be supported by the Church have already been established by an appeal to ordinary life and to the Jewish law; and the statement has been made that the Apostle having that right, did not, for wise reasons, use it. There is one higher step in the argument. It was not only a principle of Jewish law which Christ might have abrogated, but it was a provision of the Jewish economy which Christ Himself formally perpetuated.<p><span class= "bld">They which minister. . . .</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">They which minister about the holy things eat from the temple, and they which serve at the altar have their share with the altar.</span> The first part of this passage refers to the general principle that the priests who were engaged in the Temple services were supported from the various offerings which were brought there, and the second clause more definitely alludes to the particular fact that when a sacrifice was offered on the altar, the sacrificing priests, as well as the altar, had a share of the animal.

To the cavils of some, the apostle answers, so as to set forth himself as an example of self-denial, for the good of others. He had a right to marry as well as other apostles, and to claim what was needful for his wife, and his children if he had any, from the churches, without labouring with his own hands to get it. Those who seek to do our souls good, should have food provided for them. But he renounced his right, rather than hinder his success by claiming it. It is the people's duty to maintain their minister. He may wave his right, as Paul did; but those transgress a precept of Christ, who deny or withhold due support.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Do ye not know ... - In this verse Paul illustrates the doctrine that the ministers of religion were, entitled to a support from the fact that those who were appointed to offer sacrifice receive a maintenance in their work.<p>They which minister about holy things - Probably the "Levites."

It was also their duty to see that the temple was kept clean, and to prepare supplies for the sanctuary, such as oil, wine, incense, etc. They had the care of the revenues, and after the time of David were required to sing in the temple, and to play upon instruments. <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/3-1.htm">Numbers 3:1-36</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/4-1.htm">Numbers 4:1</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/4-30.htm">Numbers 4:30</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/4-35.htm">Numbers 4:35</a>, <a href="/numbers/4-42.htm">Numbers 4:42</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/8-5.htm">Numbers 8:5-22</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-3.htm">1 Chronicles 23:3-5</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-24.htm">1 Chronicles 23:24</a>, <a href="/1_chronicles/23-27.htm">1 Chronicles 23:27</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24-20.htm">1 Chronicles 24:20-31</a>.<p>Live of the things of the temple - Margin, "Feed;" that is, are supported in their work by the offerings of the people, and by the provisions which were made for the temple service; see <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/18-24.htm">Numbers 18:24-32</a>.<p>And they which wait at the altar - Probably the priests who were employed in offering sacrifice.<p>Are partakers with the altar - That is, a part of the animal offered in sacrifice is burned as an offering to God, and a part becomes the property of the priest for his support; and thus the altar and the priest become joint participators of the sacrifice.
