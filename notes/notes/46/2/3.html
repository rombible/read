The “weakness and fear and trembling” of which St. Paul speaks here had in it probably a large element of that self-distrust which so noble and sensitive a nature would feel in the fulfilment of such an exalted mission as the preaching of the Cross. I cannot think, however, the allusion is only to that. There is, I believe, a reference also to what we may call a physical apprehension of danger. The bravest are not those who do not experience any sensation of fear, but rather those who keenly appreciate danger, who have an instinctive shrinking from it, and yet eventually by their moral might conquer this dread. There are traces of this element in St. Paul’s character to be found in several places, as, for example, in <a href="/acts/18-9.htm" title="Then spoke the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not your peace:">Acts 18:9</a>, when the Lord encourages him when labouring at Corinth with the hopeful words, “Be not afraid;” again in <a href="/acts/23-11.htm" title="And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of good cheer, Paul: for as you have testified of me in Jerusalem, so must you bear witness also at Rome.">Acts 23:11</a>, when the terrible scene before Ananias had depressed him, the Lord is with him to strengthen him, “Be of good cheer, Paul;” and in <a href="/acts/27-24.htm" title="Saying, Fear not, Paul; you must be brought before Caesar: and, see, God has given you all them that sail with you.">Acts 27:24</a>, when the angel of the Lord appears to him amid the storm and shipwreck, “Fear not, Paul.”<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:1-5 Christ, in his person, and offices, and sufferings, is the sum and substance of the gospel, and ought to be the great subject of a gospel minister's preaching, but not so as to leave out other parts of God's revealed truth and will. Paul preached the whole counsel of God. Few know the fear and trembling of faithful ministers, from a deep sense of their own weakness They know how insufficient they are, and are fearful for themselves. When nothing but Christ crucified is plainly preached, the success must be entirely from Divine power accompanying the word, and thus men are brought to believe, to the salvation of their souls.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And I was with you - Paul continued there at least a year and six months. <a href="/acts/18-11.htm">Acts 18:11</a>.<p>In weakness - In conscious feebleness; diffident of my own powers, and not trusting to my own strength.<p>And in fear, and in much trembling - Paul was sensible that he had many enemies to encounter <a href="/acts/18-6.htm">Acts 18:6</a>.; and he was sensible of his own natural disadvantages as a public speaker, <a href="/2_corinthians/10-10.htm">2 Corinthians 10:10</a>. He knew too, how much the Greeks valued a manly and elegant species of oratory; and he, therefore, delivered his message with deep and anxious solicitude as to the success. It was at this time, and in view of these circumstances, that the Lord spoke to him by night in a vision, and said, "be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace; for I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee; for I have much people in this city," <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/18-9.htm">Acts 18:9-10</a>. If Paul was conscious of weakness, well may other ministers be; and if Paul sometimes trembled in deep solicitude about the result of his message, well may other ministers tremble also. It was in such circumstances, and with such feelings, that the Lord met him to encourage him - And it is when other ministers feel thus, that the promises of the gospel are inestimably precious. We may add, that it is then, and then only, that they are successful. Notwithstanding all Paul's fears, he was successful there. And it is commonly, perhaps always, when ministers go to their work conscious of their own weakness; burdened with the weight of their message; diffident of their own powers; and deeply solicitous about the result of their labors, that God sends down His Spirit, and converts sinners to God. The most successful ministers have been men who have evinced most of this feeling; and most of the revivals of religion have commenced, and continued, just as ministers have preached, conscious of their own feebleness, distrusting their own powers, and looking to God for aid and strength. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3.

The connection forbids us from thinking, with Chrysostom, Theodoret, Theophylact, Erasmus, Cornelius a Lapide, Grotius, and others, of the sufferings and persecutions (<span class="greekheb">ἀσθ</span>.), and of the apprehension of dangers, which he had to undergo in Corinth; for the text hints nothing of persecutions and dangers, and these would not necessarily furnish the motive for simplicity in preaching (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-1.htm" title="And I, brothers, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring to you the testimony of God.">1 Corinthians 2:1</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/2-4.htm" title="And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:">1 Corinthians 2:4</a> f.), nay, might even excite to the greater rhetorical exertion.
