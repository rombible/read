The Apostle here identifies Christ with the Spirit, whom he has previously spoken of as the Teacher of spiritual things.

Here is a proof of the Divine authority of the Holy Scriptures, 2Pe 1:21. In proof of the Divinity of the Holy Ghost, observe, that he knows all things, and he searches all things, even the deep things of God. No one can know the things of God, but his Holy Spirit, who is one with the Father and the Son, and who makes known Divine mysteries to his church. This is most clear testimony, both to the real Godhead and the distinct person of the Holy Spirit. The apostles were not guided by worldly principles. They had the revelation of these things from the Spirit of God, and the saving impression of them from the same Spirit. These things they declared in plain, simple language, taught by the Holy Spirit, totally different from the affected oratory or enticing words of man's wisdom. The natural man, the wise man of the world, receives not the things of the Spirit of God. The pride of carnal reasoning is really as much opposed to spirituality, as the basest sensuality. The sanctified mind discerns the real beauties of holiness, but the power of discerning and judging about common and natural things is not lost. But the carnal man is a stranger to the principles, and pleasures, and actings of the Divine life. The spiritual man only, is the person to whom God gives the knowledge of his will. How little have any known of the mind of God by natural power! And the apostles were enabled by his Spirit to make known his mind. In the Holy Scriptures, the mind of Christ, and the mind of God in Christ, are fully made known to us. It is the great privilege of Christians, that they have the mind of Christ revealed to them by his Spirit. They experience his sanctifying power in their hearts, and bring forth good fruits in their lives.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For who hath known ... - This passage is quoted from <a href="/isaiah/40-13.htm">Isaiah 40:13</a>. The interrogative form is a strong mode of denying that anyone has ever known the mind of the Lord. The argument of Paul is this, "No one can understand God. No one can fully comprehend his plans, his feelings, his views, his designs. No one by nature, under the influence of sense and passion, is either disposed to investigate his truths, or loves them when they are revealed. But the Christian is influenced by God. He has his Spirit. He has the mind of Christ; who had the mind of God. He sympathizes with Christ; he has his feelings, desires, purposes, and plans. And as no one can fully understand God by nature, so neither can he understand him who is influenced by God, and is like him; and it is not to be wondered at that he regards the Christian religion as folly, and the Christian as a fool.<p>The mind of Christ - The views, feelings, and temper of Christ. We are influenced by his Spirit.<p>Remarks On <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2.htm">1 Corinthians 2</a><p>1. Ministers of the gospel should not be too anxious to be distinguished for excellency of speech or language, <a href="/1_corinthians/2-1.htm">1 Corinthians 2:1</a>. Their aim should be to speak the simple truth, in language pure and intelligible to all. Let it be remembered, that if there ever was any place where it would be proper to seek such graces of eloquence, it was Corinth. If in any city now, or in any refined and genteel society it would be proper, it would have been proper in Corinth. Let this thought rebuke those, who, when they preach to a frivilous and fashionable auditory, seek to fill their sermons with ornament rather than with solid thought; with the tinsel of rhetoric, rather than with pure language. Paul was right in his course; and was wise. True taste abhors meretricious ornaments, as much as the gospel does. And the man who is called to preach in a rich and fashionable congregation, should remember, that he is stationed there not to please the ear, but to save the soul; that his object is not to display his talent or his eloquence, but to rescue his hearers from ruin. This purpose will make the mere ornaments of rhetoric appear small. It will give: seriousness to his discourse; gravity to his diction; unction to his eloquence; heart to his arguments; and success to his ministry.<p>2. The purpose of every minister should be like that of Paul, to preach Christ and only him crucified. See the note on <a href="/1_corinthians/2-2.htm">1 Corinthians 2:2</a>.<p>3. If Paul trembled at Corinth in view of dangers and difficulties; if he was conscious of his own weakness and feebleness, then we should learn also to be humble. He is not much in danger of erring who imitates the example of this great apostle. And if he who had received a direct commission from the great Head of the church, and who was endowed with such mighty powers, was modest, unassuming, and diffident, then it becomes ministers of the gospel now, and all others to be humble also. We should not, indeed, be afraid of people; but we should be modest, humble, and lowly; much impressed, as if conscious of our mighty charge; and anxious to deliver just such a message as God will approve and bless.<p>Would I describe a preacher, such an Paul,<p>Were he on earth, would hear, approve, and own,<p>Paul should himself direct me. I would trace.<p>His master-strokes, and draw from his design.<p>I would express him simple, grave, sincere;<p>In doctrine uncorrupt; in language plain;<p>And plain in manner, decent, solemn, chaste,<p>And natural in gesture: much impress'd.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16. For&#8212;proof of 1Co 2:15, that the spiritual man "is judged of no man." In order to judge the spiritual man, the ordinary man must "know the mind of the Lord." But "who of ordinary men knows" that?<p>that he may instruct him&#8212;that is, so as to be able to set Him right as His counsellor (quoted from Isa 40:13, 14). So the Septuagint translates the Greek verb, which means to "prove," in Ac 9:22. Natural men who judge spiritual men, living according to the mind of God ("We have the mind of Christ"), are virtually wishing to instruct God, and bring Him to another mind, as counsellors setting to right their king.<p>we have the mind of Christ&#8212;in our degree of capability to apprehend it.

Here too the <span class="greekheb">νοῦς</span> in question is God’s infinite wisdom, directing man’s salvation through inscrutable ways (<a href="/context/1_corinthians/2-6.htm" title="However, we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nothing:...">1 Corinthians 2:6-9</a>); but the Apostle’s contention is that this “mind” inspires the organs of revelation (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-10.htm" title="But God has revealed them to us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searches all things, yes, the deep things of God.">1 Corinthians 2:10</a> ff.), and <span class="ital">its</span> superiority to the judgment of the world is relatively also <span class="ital">theirs</span> (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-14.htm" title="But the natural man receives not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness to him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.">1 Corinthians 2:14</a> ff.). Paul translates the <span class="greekheb">νοῦν Κυρίου</span> of Isaiah into his own <span class="greekheb">νοῦν Χριστοῦ</span>; to him these minds are identical (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/matthew/11-27.htm" title="All things are delivered to me of my Father: and no man knows the Son, but the Father; neither knows any man the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him.">Matthew 11:27</a>, <a href="/john/5-20.htm" title="For the Father loves the Son, and shows him all things that himself does: and he will show him greater works than these, that you may marvel.">John 5:20</a>, etc.). Such interchanges betray his “innermost conviction of the Godhead of Christ” (El[453]).—<span class="greekheb">νοῦς</span> serves his turn better than the literal <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span> of the original (<span class="ital">ruach</span>); the intellectual side of the <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span> is concerned, the <span class="greekheb">θεῖον ὄμμα</span> (see note on <span class="greekheb">νοῦς</span>, <a href="/1_corinthians/1-10.htm" title="Now I beseech you, brothers, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that you be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.">1 Corinthians 1:10</a>).

The Hebrew of <a href="/isaiah/40-13.htm" title="Who has directed the Spirit of the LORD, or being his counselor has taught him?">Isaiah 40:13</a>, here quoted, has <span class="ital">spirit</span>, the Septuagint <span class="ital">mind</span>. St Paul here follows the Septuagint, which is nearer to the original than our version, ‘Who hath directed the Spirit of the Lord?’ The literal translation is, ‘Who hath measured the Spirit of the Lord?’ As none but the believer possesses the mind of the Lord, and as none can venture to assume a position of intellectual superiority to Him, the assertion in the preceding verse is established. The possession of this mind of Christ renders him who has it a mystery to him who has it not. The workings of his soul, thus enlightened by a higher power, are inscrutable to those who are destitute of spiritual vision. We must not omit to notice that in the passage which the Apostle here quotes as referring to Christ the original has Jehovah.
