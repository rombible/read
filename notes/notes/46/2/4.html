Paul preached the whole counsel of God. Few know the fear and trembling of faithful ministers, from a deep sense of their own weakness They know how insufficient they are, and are fearful for themselves. When nothing but Christ crucified is plainly preached, the success must be entirely from Divine power accompanying the word, and thus men are brought to believe, to the salvation of their souls.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And my speech - The word "speech" here - if it is to be distinguished from "preaching" - refers, perhaps, to his more private reasonings; his preaching to his public discourses.<p>Not with enticing words - Not with the persuasive reasonings (&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;  peithois logois) of the wisdom of men. Not with that kind of oratory that was adapted to captivate and charm; and which the Greeks so much esteemed.<p>But in demonstration - In the showing &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;  apodeixei; or in the testimony or evidence which the Spirit produced. The meaning is, that the Spirit furnished the evidence of the divine origin of the religion which he preached, and that it did not depend for its proof on his own reasonings or eloquence. The proof, the demonstration which the Spirit furnished was, undoubtedly, the miracles which were performed; the gift of tongues; and the remarkable conversions which attended the gospel - The word "Spirit" here refers, doubtless, to the Holy Spirit; and Paul says that this Spirit had furnished demonstration of the divine origin and nature of the gospel. This had been by the gift of tongues (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-5.htm">1 Corinthians 1:5-7</a>. Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14.htm">1 Corinthians 14</a>), and by the effects of his agency in renewing and sanctifying the heart.<p>And of power - That is, of the power of God <a href="/1_corinthians/2-5.htm">1 Corinthians 2:5</a>; the divine power and efficacy which attended the preaching of the gospel there. Compare <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-5.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:5</a> - The effect of the gospel is the evidence to which the apostle appeals for its truth. That effect was seen:<p>(1) In the conversion of sinners to God of all classes, ages, and conditions, when all human means of reforming them was vain.<p>(2) in its giving them peace, joy, and happiness; and in its transforming their lives.<p>(3) in making them different people - in making the drunkard sober; the thief honest; the licentious pure; the profane reverent; the indolent industrious; the harsh and unkind, gentle and kind; and the wretched happy.<p>(4) in its diffusing a mild and pure influence over the laws and customs of society; and in promoting human happiness everywhere - And in regard to this evidence to which the apostle appeals, we may observe:<p>(1) That is a kind of evidence which anyone may examine, and which no one can deny. It does not need labored, abstruse argumentation, but it is everywhere in society. Every man has witnessed the effects of the gospel in reforming the vicious, and no one can deny that it has this power.<p>(2) it is a mighty display of the power of God. There is no more striking exhibition of his power over mind than in a revival of religion. There is no where more manifest demonstration of his presence than when, in such a revival, the proud are humbled, the profane are awed, the blasphemer is silenced, and the profligate, the abandoned, and the moral are converted unto God, and are led as lost sinners to the same cross, and find the same peace.<p>(3) the gospel has thus evidenced from age to age that it is from God. Every converted sinner furnishes such a demonstration; and every instance where it produces peace, hope, joy, shows that it is from heaven. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. my speech&#8212;in private.<p>preaching&#8212;in public [Bengel].

God's means is demonstration, leaving no doubt, and inspiring implicit faith, by the powerful working of the Spirit (then exhibited both outwardly by miracles, and inwardly by working on the heart, now in the latter and the more important way only, Mt 7:29; Ac 6:10; Heb 4:12; compare also Ro 15:19). The same simple power accompanies divine truth now, producing certain persuasion and conversion, when the Spirit demonstrates by it.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_corinthians/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Either here Paul’s <span class="bld">speech and preaching</span> signify the same thing, (expressed by two words), or else <span class="ital">speech</span> referreth to his more private conferences and discourses with them, and <span class="ital">preaching</span> signifieth the more public acts of his ministry; neither of them was <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">with</span> the persuasive or <span class="bld">enticing words of man’s wisdom.</span> What these persuasive words of man’s wisdom are, will quickly appear to any that considers there are but two human arts that pretend to any thing of persuading; rhetoric, and logic, or the art of reasoning. Rhetoric persuadeth more weakly, working more upon the affections than upon the understanding and judgment. Logic, or the art of reasoning, more strongly, working upon the understanding and judgment, and teaching men to conclude from connate natural principles. Now, saith Paul, my preaching was neither of these ways, I neither studied neat and fine words and phrases, nor did I make it my work to demonstrate gospel propositions to you from principles of natural reason. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Object.</span> Ought not then ministers now to use such words? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Answer.</span> A learned popish writer saith, that "at that time it was the will of God that his ministers should use plain speech; but it is otherwise now; the using of words studiously composed and ordered, being now the ordinary way to persuade others." But: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. After this rate any thing of the will of God may be evaded; it is but saying, that it was the will of God indeed then, but not now. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. The thing is false. It was then, as much as now, the ordinary way of persuading to use rhetorical phrases and rational demonstrations. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. Although now this be the ordinary method of persuading men of learning and capacities, yet for the generality of people it is not so. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>4. The apostle’s reason holds now as much as ever. It is the way to make Christians’ faith stand <span class="ital">in the wisdom of men, </span> not <span class="ital">in the power of God.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Object.</span> Ought then ministers to use no study, but talk whatever comes at their tongue’s end, and to use no reason to prove what they say? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Answer.</span> By no means. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. It is one thing to study matter, another thing to study words. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. Nay, it is one thing to study a decency in words, another to study a gaudery of phrase. It is an old and true saying, <span class="ital">Verba sequuntur res</span>: Words will follow matter, if the preacher be but of ordinary parts. In the study of words we have but two things to attend: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(1) That we speak intelligibly, so as all the people may understand. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(2) That we speak gravely and decently. All other study of words and phrases in a divine is but folly and vanity. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. We ought to use our reason in our preaching; but reason works two ways: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(1) Either making conclusions from natural and philosophical principles; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(2) Or, from Scriptural principles. We ought to study to conclude as strongly as we can what we say from principles of revelation, comparing spiritual things with spiritual, but not from all natural and philosophical principles; for so we shall conclude, there is no Trinity in the Unity of the Divine Being, because, according to natural principles, three cannot be one, nor one three; and against the resurrection, because there can be no regress from a privation to a habit, &c. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>4. Again, it is one thing to use our natural reason, <span class="ital">ex abundanti, </span> as an auxiliary help to illustrate and confirm what is first confirmed by Divine revelation; another thing to use it as a foundation upon which we build a spiritual conclusion, or as the main proof of it. Paul’s preaching was in words intelligible to his hearers, and decent enough, and with reason enough, but not concluding upon natural principles, nor making any proofs of that nature the foundation upon which he built his gospel conclusions. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">But in demonstration of the Spirit; </span> by which Grotius and some others understand miracles, by which the doctrine of the gospel was at first confirmed; but Vorstius and many others better understand by it the Holy Ghost’s powerful and inward persuasion of men’s minds, of the truth of what was preached by Paul. All ministers’ preaching makes propositions of gospel truth appear no more than probable; the Spirit only demonstrates them, working in souls such a persuasion and confirmation of the truth of them, as the soul can no longer deny or dispute, or withstand the conviction of them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">And of power:</span> by this term also some understand the power of working miracles; but it is much better by others interpreted of that authority, which the word of God preached by Paul had, and preached by faithful ministers still hath, upon the souls and consciences of those that hear it. As it is said, <span class="bld"><a href="/matthew/7-29.htm" title="For he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.">Matthew 7:29</a></span>, Christ <span class="ital">taught them as one having authority.</span> And it is said of Stephen, <span class="bld"><a href="/acts/6-10.htm" title="And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spoke.">Acts 6:10</a></span>, <span class="ital">They were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake.</span> So the gospel preached by Paul came to people, <span class="ital">not in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-5.htm" title="For our gospel came not to you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance; as you know what manner of men we were among you for your sake.">1 Thessalonians 1:5</a></span>: and was <span class="ital">quick, and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm" title="For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any two edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.">Hebrews 4:12</a></span>. And thus every faithful minister, with whose labours God goeth along in the conversion of souls, yet preacheth <span class="ital">in the demonstration of the Spirit and of power.</span> Nor indeed call those miracles, by which Christ and his apostles confirmed the truth of the doctrine of the gospel, though they were a mighty proof, be, in any propriety of speech, called a <span class="ital">demonstration; </span> which, properly, is a proof in which the mind fully acquiesceth, so that it no longer denieth or disputeth the thing so proved, but gives a firm and full assent to it: the miracles wrought by Christ himself never had that effect; the Pharisees and the generality of the Jews believed not that Christ was the true Messiah and the Son of God, not withstanding his miracles. Nothing but the inward powerful impression of the Spirit of God, persuading the heart of the truth of gospel principles, can possibly amount to a <span class="ital">demonstration, </span> bringing the minds of men, though never so judicious and prepared, to a certainty of the thing revealed, and a rest, so as they can no longer deny, resist, dispute, or contradict it. With this Paul’s preaching was attended, not to every individual person to whom he preached, but to many, even as many as should be saved: he delivered the doctrine of the gospel freely, plainly, and boldly, not resting upon the force of his rhetoric and persuasive words, nor yet upon the natural force of his reasoning and argumentation; but leaving the demonstration and evidencing of the truth of what he said to the powerful internal impression and persuasion of the holy and blessed Spirit of God, who worketh powerfully. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_corinthians/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And my speech, and my preaching,.... As he determined, so he acted.

It is doubtful whether we should translate ‘the Spirit’ here, as though the Holy Spirit were meant, and more than doubtful whether we should interpret ‘power’ of miracles as generally understood. The Apostle is perhaps rather referring to that conviction of sin, righteousness and judgment (St <a href="/john/16-8.htm" title="And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:">John 16:8</a>), which the Spirit of God produces in the spirit of man, and of the power to produce a change of heart and life which is the leading characteristic of the gospel. This view seems confirmed by the next verse, in which St Paul says that the ground of our faith is not the wisdom of men, but the power of God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/1_corinthians/2.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/1_corinthians/2-4.htm" title="And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:">1 Corinthians 2:4</a>. <span class="greekheb">Λόγος</span>, <span class="ital">speech</span>) in private.—<span class="greekheb">κήρυγμα</span>, <span class="ital">preaching</span>) in public.—<span class="greekheb">πειθοῖς</span>) <span class="ital">enticing</span>, a very appropriate term, to which the antithesis is <span class="ital">in demonstration</span>.

This simplicity was the more remarkable because "Corinthian words" was a proverb for choice, elaborate, and glittering phrases (Wetstein). It is not improbable that the almost total and deeply discouraging want of success of St. Paul in preaching at Athens had impressed him mere strongly with the uselessness of attempting to fight Greek philosophers with their own blunt and imperfect weapons. <span class="cmt_word">In demonstration of the Spirit and of power</span>. So he says to the Thessalonians," Our gospel came not to you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance." The plain facts, so repellent to the natural intellect, were driven home with matchless force by spiritual conviction. The only heathen critic who has mentioned St. Paul's method is Longinus, the author of the treatise on 'The Sublime and Beautiful,' who calls him "a master of unproved dogma," meaning apparently that his force lay in the irresistible statement of the facts which he came to preach. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/1_corinthians/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>In demonstration (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;)<p>Only here in the New Testament.
