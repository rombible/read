<span class="ital">I came not with excellency of speech, </span>&c. — I did not affect either deep wisdom, or commanding eloquence; <span class="ital">declaring the testimony of God </span>— What God gave me to testify concerning his Son, namely, concerning his incarnation, his doctrine, his miracles, his life, his death, his resurrection and exaltation to be <span class="ital">a Prince and a Saviour. </span>This is called <span class="ital">the testimony of God, </span><a href="/1_john/5-9.htm" title="If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater: for this is the witness of God which he has testified of his Son.">1 John 5:9</a>, because God bore witness to the truth of these things by signs, and wonders, and divers miracles, and distributions of the Holy Ghost, <a href="/hebrews/2-4.htm" title="God also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will?">Hebrews 2:4</a>. The expression implies that the evidence of the great facts of Christianity, and of the truth and importance of the doctrines of the gospel, is not founded on proofs drawn from human reason, but on the authority of God, who hath revealed them by his Spirit, and confirmed them by miracles, and by the extraordinary influence which they had on the hearts and lives of multitudes.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:1-5 Christ, in his person, and offices, and sufferings, is the sum and substance of the gospel, and ought to be the great subject of a gospel minister's preaching, but not so as to leave out other parts of God's revealed truth and will. Paul preached the whole counsel of God. Few know the fear and trembling of faithful ministers, from a deep sense of their own weakness They know how insufficient they are, and are fearful for themselves. When nothing but Christ crucified is plainly preached, the success must be entirely from Divine power accompanying the word, and thus men are brought to believe, to the salvation of their souls.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And I, brethren - Keeping up the tender and affectionate style of address.<p>When I came unto you - When I came at first to preach the gospel at Corinth. Act 18:1ff.<p>Came not with excellency of speech - Came not with graceful and attractive eloquence. The apostle here evidently alludes to that nice ant studied choice of language; to those gracefully formed sentences, and to that skill of arrangement in discourse and argument which was so much an object of regard with the Greek rhetoricians. It is probable that Paul was never much distinguished for these (compare <a href="/2_corinthians/10-10.htm">2 Corinthians 10:10</a>), and it is certain he never made them an object of intense study and solicitude. Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-4.htm">1 Corinthians 2:4</a>, <a href="/1_corinthians/2-13.htm">1 Corinthians 2:13</a>.<p>Or of wisdom - Of the wisdom of this world; of that kind of wisdom which was sought and cultivated in Greece.<p>The testimony of God - The testimony or the witnessing which God has borne to the gospel of Christ by miracles, and by attending it everywhere with his presence and blessing. In <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-6.htm">1 Corinthians 2:6</a>, the gospel is called "the testimony of Christ;" and here it may either mean the witness which the gospel bears to the true character and plans of God; or the witnessing which God had borne to the gospel by miracles, etc. The gospel contains the testimony of God in regard to his own character and plans; especially in regard to the great plan of redemption through Jesus Christ. Several mss. instead of "testimony of God," here read "the mystery of God." This would accord well with the scope of the argument; but the present reading is probably the correct one. See Mill. The Syriac version has also "mystery." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 2<p>1Co 2:1-16. Paul's Subject of Preaching, Christ Crucified, Not in Worldly, but in Heavenly, Wisdom among the Perfect.<p>1. And I&#8212;"So I" [Conybeare] as one of the "foolish, weak, and despised" instruments employed by God (1Co 1:27, 28); "glorying in the Lord," not in man's wisdom (1Co 1:31). Compare 1Co 1:23, "We."<p>when I came&#8212;(Ac 18:1, &c.). Paul might, had he pleased, have used an ornate style, having studied secular learning at Tarsus of Cilicia, which Strabo preferred as a school of learning to Athens or Alexandria; here, doubtless, he read the Cilician Aratus' poems (which he quotes, Ac 17:28), and Epimenides (Tit 1:12), and Menander (1Co 15:33). Grecian intellectual development was an important element in preparing the way for the Gospel, but it failed to regenerate the world, showing that for this a superhuman power is needed. Hellenistic (Grecizing) Judaism at Tarsus and Alexandria was the connecting link between the schools of Athens and those of the Rabbis. No more fitting birthplace could there have been for the apostle of the Gentiles than Tarsus, free as it was from the warping influences of Rome, Alexandria, and Athens. He had at the same time Roman citizenship, which protected him from sudden violence. Again, he was reared in the Hebrew divine law at Jerusalem. Thus, as the three elements, Greek cultivation, Roman polity (Lu 2:1), and the divine law given to the Jews, combined just at Christ's time, to prepare the world for the Gospel, so the same three, by God's marvellous providence, met together in the apostle to the Gentiles [Conybeare and Howson].<p>testimony of God&#8212;"the testimony of Christ" (1Co 1:6); therefore Christ is God.<span class="bld"><a href="/context/1_corinthians/2-1.htm" title="And I, brothers, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring to you the testimony of God....">1 Corinthians 2:1-5</a></span> Paul declareth that he used not human learning and<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>eloquence in preaching the gospel to his converts,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>that their faith, being built on the testimony of the<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Spirit, and on miracles, might be solely ascribed to God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><a href="/context/1_corinthians/2-6.htm" title="However, we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nothing:...">1 Corinthians 2:6-13</a></span> The gospel doth contain God’s wise, but secret,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>counsel for bringing men to glory; which no natural<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>abilities could discover, but the Spirit of God only,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>by which it was revealed to the apostles.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><a href="/context/1_corinthians/2-14.htm" title="But the natural man receives not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness to him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned....">1 Corinthians 2:14-16</a></span> Upon this account, both the doctrine and its teachers<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>are held in disesteem by the mere natural man, who is<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>not duly qualified to judge of and discern them.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> It should seem by the apostle’s so often declaring against that vanity, that even that age much admired a style, and ministers in sacred things delivering their minds, not in a mere decent, but in a lofty, high-flown phrase; and that they vilified St. Paul, because his phrase did not so tickle their ears.

This account the apostle gives of himself is occasioned, either by what he had said in the latter part of the preceding chapter, concerning the choice God has made of the foolish, weak, base, and despicable things of the world, and of his calling them by his grace both to fellowship with the saints in common, and therefore he accommodated his ministry unto them, and in particular to the ministry of the word, of which he himself was a like instance and an example; or else by what he had declared in <a href="/1_corinthians/1-17.htm">1 Corinthians 1:17</a> of the same chapter, that he was sent to preach the Gospel, <p>not with wisdom of words; which he here reassumes, and affirms agreeably, that when he first came to Corinth, he <p>came not with excellency of speech, or of wisdom; for though he was not only versed in Jewish learning, being brought up at the feet of Gamaliel; but had also a good share of Grecian literature, and was capable, upon proper occasions, to cite the Greek poets, as he does Aratus, <a href="/acts/17-28.htm">Acts 17:28</a> and Menander, <a href="/titus/1-12.htm">Titus 1:12</a> and so could, had he thought fit, have adorned his discourses with pompous language, with the flowers of rhetoric, and the eloquence of the Grecians; yet he chose not such a high and florid style, and which savoured so much of human wisdom and art; for the subject he treated of required no such dress, nor any great swelling words of vanity, or a bombast style to set it off, and gain the applause and assent of men: for what he delivered were plain matters of fact, attested by God himself, <p>declaring unto you the testimony of God; that is, the Gospel, which bears a testimony to the love, grace, and mercy of God, his kindness and good will to the sons of men, in giving and sending his only begotten Son to be the Saviour and Redeemer of them; and in which God bears a testimony of his Son, of his sonship, deity, mediation, incarnation, obedience, sufferings, and death, of his resurrection, ascension to heaven, session at his right hand, intercession for his people, and his second coming to judgment, and of eternal life and salvation by him. All which being matter of fact, and depending upon the witness of God, which is greater than that of men, needed no art nor oratory of men to recommend it: it was enough in plain words, and easy language, to declare it, with the evidence by which it was supported. The Alexandrian copy, and some others, read, "the mystery" of God: and so the Syriac version , "the mystery of God" one of Stephens's copies reads, "the mystery of Christ"; and the Vulgate Latin version, "the testimony of Christ". <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_corinthians/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And <span class="cverse3">{1}</span> I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> testimony of God.</span><p>(1) He returns to 1Co 1:17, that is to say, to his own example: confessing that he did not use among them either excellency of words or enticing speech of man's wisdom, but with great simplicity of speech both knew and preached Jesus Christ crucified, humbled and abject, with regard to the flesh.<p>(a) The Gospel.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/1_corinthians/2.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/1_corinthians/2-1.htm" title="And I, brothers, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring to you the testimony of God.">1 Corinthians 2:1</a>. <span class="greekheb">Κἀγώ</span>] <span class="ital">I too</span>, as is the duty, in accordance with the previous explanation (<a href="/context/1_corinthians/1-17.htm" title="For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect....">1 Corinthians 1:17-31</a>), of every preacher of the gospel.

So he returns to his starting-point, <span class="ital">viz.</span>, that “Christ sent” him “to bring good tidings,” such as neither required nor admitted of “wisdom of word” (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-17.htm" title="For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect.">1 Corinthians 1:17</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[287] Corinth, Corinthian or Corinthians.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/1_corinthians/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>Ch. 2.
