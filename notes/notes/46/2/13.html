The word translated here “comparing” in our Authorised version is used in the sense of expounding or teaching in the LXX.

So here, the spiritual things are “compared” with the spiritual language in which they are stated. Another meaning—<span class= "ital">explaining spiritual things to spiritual men</span>—has been suggested, but that adopted would seem to be the more simple and natural. This second interpretation, would make these words the introduction to the remark which follows about “the spiritual man,” but it involves a use of the word in which it is not found elsewhere in the New Testament.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:10-16 God has revealed true wisdom to us by his Spirit. Here is a proof of the Divine authority of the Holy Scriptures, 2Pe 1:21. In proof of the Divinity of the Holy Ghost, observe, that he knows all things, and he searches all things, even the deep things of God. No one can know the things of God, but his Holy Spirit, who is one with the Father and the Son, and who makes known Divine mysteries to his church. This is most clear testimony, both to the real Godhead and the distinct person of the Holy Spirit. The apostles were not guided by worldly principles. They had the revelation of these things from the Spirit of God, and the saving impression of them from the same Spirit. These things they declared in plain, simple language, taught by the Holy Spirit, totally different from the affected oratory or enticing words of man's wisdom. The natural man, the wise man of the world, receives not the things of the Spirit of God. The pride of carnal reasoning is really as much opposed to spirituality, as the basest sensuality. The sanctified mind discerns the real beauties of holiness, but the power of discerning and judging about common and natural things is not lost. But the carnal man is a stranger to the principles, and pleasures, and actings of the Divine life. The spiritual man only, is the person to whom God gives the knowledge of his will. How little have any known of the mind of God by natural power! And the apostles were enabled by his Spirit to make known his mind. In the Holy Scriptures, the mind of Christ, and the mind of God in Christ, are fully made known to us. It is the great privilege of Christians, that they have the mind of Christ revealed to them by his Spirit. They experience his sanctifying power in their hearts, and bring forth good fruits in their lives.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Which things we speak - Which great, and glorious, and certain truths, we, the apostles, preach and explain.<p>Not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth - Not such as human philosophy or eloquence would dictate. They do not have their origin in the devices of human wisdom, and they are not expressed in such words of dazzling and attractive rhetoric as would be employed by those who pride themselves on the wisdom of this world.<p>But which the Holy Ghost teacheth - That is, in the words which the Holy Spirit imparts to us. Locke understands this as referring to the fact that the apostles used "the language and expressions" which the Holy Spirit had taught in the revelations of the Scriptures. But this is evidently giving a narrow view of the subject. The apostle is speaking of the whole course of instruction by which the deep things of God were made known to the Christian church; and all this was not made known in the very words which were already contained in the Old Testament. He evidently refers to the fact that the apostles were themselves under the direction of the Holy Spirit, in the words and doctrines which they imparted; and this passage is a full proof that they laid claim to divine inspiration. It is further observable that he says, that this was done in such "words" as the Holy Spirit taught, referring not to the doctrines or subjects merely, but to the manner of expressing them. It is evident here that he lays claim to an inspiration in regard to the words which he used, or to the manner of his stating the doctrines of revelation. Words are the signs of thoughts; and if God designed that his truth should be accurately expressed in human language, there must have been a supervision over the words used, that such should be employed, and such only, as should accurately express the sense which he intended to convey.<p>Comparing spiritual things with spiritual - &#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;  pneumatikois pneumatika sugkrinontes. This expression has been very variously interpreted; and is very difficult of explanation. LeClerc renders it "speaking spiritual things to spiritual men." Most of the fathers rendered it: "comparing the things which were written by the Spirit of the Old Testament with what is now revealed to us by the same Spirit, and confirming our doctrine by them." Calvin renders the word "comparing" by "fitting," or adapting ("aptare"), and says that it means "that he adapted spiritual things to spiritual people, while he accommodated words to the thing; that is he tempered that celestial wisdom of the Spirit with simple language, and which conveyed by itself the native energy of the Spirit." Thus, says he, he reproved the vanity of those who attempted to secure human applause by a turgid and subtle mode of argument.<p>Grotius accords with the fathers, and renders it, "explaining those things which the prophets spake by the Spirit of God, by those things which Christ has made known to us by his Spirit." Macknight renders it: "explaining spiritual things in words taught by the Spirit." So Doddridge - The word rendered "comparing" &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;  sugkrinontes, means properly "to collect, join, mingle, unite together"; then "to separate or distinguish parts of things and unite them into one"; then "to judge of the qualities of objects by carefully separating or distinguishing"; then "to compare for the purpose of judging," etc. Since it means to compare one thing with another for the purpose of explaining its nature, it comes to signify to "interpret," to "explain;" and in this sense it is often used by the Septuagint as a translation of the Hebrew word &#1508;&#1514;&#1512;  phathar, "to open, unfold, explain." (See <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/40-8.htm">Genesis 40:8</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/40-16.htm">Genesis 40:16</a>, <a href="/genesis/40-22.htm">Genesis 40:22</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/41-12.htm">Genesis 41:12</a>, <a href="/genesis/41-15.htm">Genesis 41:15</a>); also of &#1508;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;  paarash, "to explain"; and of the Chaldee peshar, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/5-13.htm">Daniel 5:13</a>, <a href="/daniel/5-17.htm">Daniel 5:17</a>.

In this sense the word is, doubtless, used here, and is to be interpreted in the sense of "explaining, unfolding." There is no reason, either in the word used here, or in the argument of the apostle, why the sense of comparing should be retained.<p>Spiritual things - &#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#768;  pneumatika. Things, doctrines, subjects that pertain to the teaching of the Spirit. It does not mean things "spiritual" in opposition to "fleshly;" or "intellectual" in opposition to things pertaining to "matter;" but spiritual as the things referred to were such as were performed, and revealed by the Holy Spirit - his doctrines on the subject of religion under the new dispensation, and his influence on the heart.<p>With spiritual - &#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2;  pneumatikois. This is an adjective; and may be either masculine or neuter. It is evident, that some noun is understood. That may be either:<p>(1) &#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;  anthro&#772;pois, "men" - and then it will mean "to spiritual men" - that is, to people who are enlightened or taught by the Spirit and thus many commentators understand it; or,<p>(2) It may be &#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;  logois, "words" - and then it may mean, either that the "spiritual things" were explained by "words" and illustrations drawn from the writings of the Old Testament, inspired by the Spirit - as most of the fathers, and many moderns understand it; or that the "things spiritual" were explained by-words which the Holy Spirit then communicated, and which were adapted to the subject - simple, pure, elevated; not gross, not turgid, not distinguished for rhetoric, and not such as the Greeks sought, but such as became the Spirit of God communicating great, sublime, yet simple truths to people.<p>It will then mean "explaining doctrines that pertain to the Spirit's teaching and influence in words that are taught; by the same Spirit, and that are suited to convey in the most intelligible manner those doctrines to men." Here the idea of the Holy Spirit's present agency is kept up throughout; the idea that he communicates the doctrine, and the mode of stating it to man - The supposition that &#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;  logois, words, is the word understood here, is favored by the fact that it occurs in the previous part of this verse. And if this be the sense, it means that the words which were used by the apostles were pure, simple, unostentatious, and undistinguished by display - such as became doctrines taught by the Holy Spirit, when communicated in words suggested by the same Spirit. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. also&#8212;We not only know by the Holy Ghost, but we also speak the "things freely given to us of God" (1Co 2:12).<p>which the Holy Ghost teacheth&#8212;The old manuscripts read "the Spirit" simply, without "Holy."<p>comparing spiritual things with spiritual&#8212;expounding the Spirit-inspired Old Testament Scripture, by comparison with the Gospel which Jesus by the same Spirit revealed [Grotius]; and conversely illustrating the Gospel mysteries by comparing them with the Old Testament types [Chrysostom]. So the Greek word is translated, "comparing" (2Co 10:12). Wahl (Key of the New Testament) translates, "explaining (as the Greek is translated, Ge 40:8, the Septuagint) to spiritual (that is, Spirit-taught) men, spiritual things (the things which we ourselves are taught by the Spirit)." Spirit-taught men alone can comprehend spiritual truths. This accords with 1Co 2:6, 9, 10, 14, 15; 1Co 3:1. Alford translates, "Putting together (combining) spirituals with spirituals"; that is, attaching spiritual words to spiritual things, which we should not do, if we were to use words of worldly wisdom to expound spiritual things (so 1Co 2:1, 4; 1Pe 4:11). Perhaps the generality of the neuters is designed to comprehend these several notions by implication. Comparing, or combining, spirituals with spirituals; implying both that spiritual things are only suited to spiritual persons (so "things" comprehended persons, 1Co 1:27), and also that spiritual truths can only be combined with spiritual (not worldly-wise) words; and lastly, spirituals of the Old and New Testaments can only be understood by mutual comparison or combination, not by combination with worldly "wisdom," or natural perceptions (1Co 1:21, 22; 2:1, 4-9; compare Ps 119:18).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_corinthians/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Reason and all practice directeth men to speak and write of subjects in a style and phrase fitted to the matter about which they write or discourse.

So in substance also Erasmus, Beza, Calvin, Balduin, Wolf, Baumgarten, Kling in the <span class="ital">Stud. und Krit.</span> 1839, p. 437, de Wette, Osiander, Maier, etc., and rightly, since this sense suits the connection singularly well, and does not in any degree clash with the classical use of <span class="greekheb">συγκρίνειν</span> (Valckenaer, p. 134 f.; Porson, <span class="ital">a</span>[408]<span class="ital"> Med.</span> 136). Plato has it frequently in this meaning, and in contrast to <span class="greekheb">διακρίνειν</span>. See Ast, <span class="ital">Lex. Plat.</span> III. p. 290 f. Other commentators, while also taking <span class="greekheb">πνευματ</span>. as <span class="ital">neuter</span>, make <span class="greekheb">συγκρίνειν</span>, <span class="ital">explicare</span>, namely, either: <span class="ital">explaining the N.

But the first two of these renderings are against the context, and all the three are against the <span class="ital">usus loquendi</span>; for <span class="greekheb">συγκρίνειν</span> is never absolutely <span class="ital">interpretari</span>, either in profane Greek (in which, among later writers, as also in <a href="/2_corinthians/10-12.htm" title="For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise.">2 Corinthians 10:12</a>, <a href="//apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/7-29.htm" title="For she is more beautiful than the sun, and above all the order of stars: being compared with the light, she is found before it.">Wis 7:29</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/15-18.htm" title="Yea, they worshipped those beasts also that are most hateful: for being compared together, some are worse than others.">Wis 15:18</a>, <a href="//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/10-71.htm" title="Now therefore, if thou trustest in thine own strength, come down to us into the plain field, and there let us try the matter together: for with me is the power of the cities.">1Ma 10:71</a>, it very often means to <span class="ital">compare</span>; comp Vulgate: <span class="ital">comparantes</span>, and see Lobeck, <span class="ital">a</span>[411]<span class="ital"> Phryn.</span> p. 278) or in the LXX. With the latter it is indeed the common word for the <span class="ital">interpretation of dreams</span> (<span class="greekheb">פתר</span>, see <a href="/genesis/40-8.htm" title="And they said to him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is no interpreter of it.

The meaning, <span class="ital">to judge</span>, however, although instances of it may be established in Greek writers also (Anthol. vii. 132; Polybius, xiv. 3, 7, xii. 10. 1; Lucian. <span class="ital">Soloec.</span> 5), would be unsuitable here, for this reason, that the phrase <span class="greekheb">πνευματικοῖς πνευματικά</span>, both being taken as neuter, manifestly, according to the context, expresses the relation of matter and form, not the judging of the one <span class="greekheb">πνευματικόν</span> by the other (Ewald), notwithstanding that Luther, too, adopts a similar interpretation: “<span class="ital">and judge spiritual things spiritually</span>.” Lastly, it is incorrect to take <span class="greekheb">πνευματικοῖς</span> as masculine, and render: <span class="ital">explaining things revealed by the Spirit to those who are led by the Spirit</span> (the same as <span class="greekheb">τελείοις</span> in <a href="/1_corinthians/2-6.htm" title="However, we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nothing:">1 Corinthians 2:6</a>; comp <a href="/galatians/6-1.htm" title="Brothers, if a man be overtaken in a fault, you which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering yourself, lest you also be tempted.">Galatians 6:1</a>). This is the view of Pelagius, Sedulius, Theophylact (suggested only), Thomas, Estius, Clericus, Bengel, Rosenmüller, Pott, Heydenreich, Flatt, Billroth, Rückert. To the same class belongs the exposition of Hofmann, according to whom what is meant is the <span class="ital">solution of the problem</span> as to how <span class="ital">the world beyond and hereafter</span> reveals and foreshows itself in what God’s grace <span class="ital">has already bestowed</span> upon us (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-12.htm" title="Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.">1 Corinthians 2:12</a>) in a predictive sign as it were,—a solution which has spiritual things for its object, and takes place for those who are spiritual. But the text does not contain either a contrast between the world here and that hereafter, or a problematic relation of the one to the other; the contrast is introduced into <span class="greekheb">τὰ χαρισθέντα</span> in <a href="/1_corinthians/2-12.htm" title="Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.">1 Corinthians 2:12</a>, and the problem and its predictive sign are imported into <span class="greekheb">συγκρίνοντες</span>.[416] Again, it is by no means required by the connection with <a href="/1_corinthians/2-14.htm" title="But the natural man receives not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness to him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.">1 Corinthians 2:14</a> ff. that we should take <span class="greekheb">πνευματικοῖς</span> as masculine; for <a href="/1_corinthians/2-14.htm" title="But the natural man receives not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness to him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.">1 Corinthians 2:14</a> begins a new part of the discourse, so that <span class="greekheb">ψυχικὸς ἄνθρωπος</span> only finds its personal contrast in <span class="greekheb">ὁ δὲ πνευματικός</span> in <a href="/1_corinthians/2-15.htm" title="But he that is spiritual judges all things, yet he himself is judged of no man.">1 Corinthians 2:15</a>.

It has been rendered, "Blending spiritual things with spiritual" (Kling, Wordsworth), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> not adulterating them with carnal admixtures (<a href="/2_corinthians/2-17.htm">2 Corinthians 2:17</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-22.htm">1 Peter 2:22</a>). "Interpreting spiritual things to spiritual men" (Bengel, Reichert, Stanley, margin of Revised Version; see <a href="/genesis/40-8.htm">Genesis 40:8</a>; <a href="/daniel/5-12.htm">Daniel 5:12</a>, LXX.). "Explaining spiritual things in spiritual words." This meaning the Greek will not bear, but Calvin and Beza get the same meaning by rendering it, "Adapting spiritual things to spiritual words." It is doubtful whether the Greek verb (<span class="accented">sunkrinontes</span>) can be rendered "comparing," which comes from the Vulgate, <span class="accented">comparantes.</span> Wickliffe has the version, "Maken a liknesse of spyritual things to goostli men, for a besteli man persuyved not through thingis." The commonest sense of the word in the LXX. is "interpreting" (<a href="/genesis/40-8.htm">Genesis 40:8</a>, etc.), and the best rendering is, "Explaining spirituals to spiritual men." If it be supposed that the verb <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span> acquired the sense of "comparing" in Hellenistic Greek (<a href="/2_corinthians/10-12.htm">2 Corinthians 10:12</a>; Wisd. 7:29 Wisd. 15:18), then the rendering of our Authorized Version may stand. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/1_corinthians/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth<p>Lit., not in the taught words of human wisdom.

The dispute on this verse arises over the meanings of &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;, A.V., comparing, and &#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; spiritual. As to the latter, whether the reference is to spiritual men, things, or words; as to the former, whether the meaning is adapting, interpreting, proving, or comparing. The principal interpretations are: adapting spiritual words to spiritual things; adapting spiritual things to spiritual men; interpreting spiritual things to spiritual men; interpreting spiritual things by spiritual words. &#x3a3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2; occurs only here and <a href="//biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-12.htm">2 Corinthians 10:12</a>, where the meaning is clearly compare. In classical Greek the original meaning is to compound, and later, to compare, as in Aristotle and Plutarch, and to interpret, used of dreams, and mainly in Septuagint. See <a href="/genesis/40-8.htm">Genesis 40:8</a>. The most satisfactory interpretation is combining spiritual things with spiritual words. After speaking of spiritual things (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-11.htm">1 Corinthians 2:11</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-12.htm">1 Corinthians 2:12</a>, <a href="/1_corinthians/2-13.htm">1 Corinthians 2:13</a>), Paul now speaks of the forms in which they are conveyed - spiritual forms or words answering to spiritual matters, and says, we combine spiritual things with spiritual forms of expression. This would not be the case if we uttered the revelations of the Spirit in the speech of human wisdom. </body></html>
