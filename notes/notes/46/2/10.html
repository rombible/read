Here is a proof of the Divine authority of the Holy Scriptures, 2Pe 1:21. In proof of the Divinity of the Holy Ghost, observe, that he knows all things, and he searches all things, even the deep things of God. No one can know the things of God, but his Holy Spirit, who is one with the Father and the Son, and who makes known Divine mysteries to his church. This is most clear testimony, both to the real Godhead and the distinct person of the Holy Spirit. The apostles were not guided by worldly principles. They had the revelation of these things from the Spirit of God, and the saving impression of them from the same Spirit. These things they declared in plain, simple language, taught by the Holy Spirit, totally different from the affected oratory or enticing words of man's wisdom. The natural man, the wise man of the world, receives not the things of the Spirit of God. The pride of carnal reasoning is really as much opposed to spirituality, as the basest sensuality. The sanctified mind discerns the real beauties of holiness, but the power of discerning and judging about common and natural things is not lost. But the carnal man is a stranger to the principles, and pleasures, and actings of the Divine life. The spiritual man only, is the person to whom God gives the knowledge of his will. How little have any known of the mind of God by natural power! And the apostles were enabled by his Spirit to make known his mind. In the Holy Scriptures, the mind of Christ, and the mind of God in Christ, are fully made known to us. It is the great privilege of Christians, that they have the mind of Christ revealed to them by his Spirit. They experience his sanctifying power in their hearts, and bring forth good fruits in their lives.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But God hath revealed them - That is, those elevated views and enjoyments to which people everywhere else had been strangers, and which have been under all other forms of religion unknown, have been communicated to us by the revelation of God - This verse commences the "third" part of this chapter, in which the apostle shows how these truths, so full of wisdom had been communicated to Christians. It had not been by any native endowments of theirs; not by any strength of faculties, or powers. but solely by revelation from God.Unto us - That is, first to the apostles; secondly, to all Christians - to the church and the world through their inspired instructors; and third, to all Christians by the illuminating agency of the Spirit on their hearts. The connection shows that he did not mean to confine this declaration to the apostles merely, for his design was to show that all Christians had this knowledge of the true wisdom. It was true that this was revealed in an eminent manner to the apostles, and through their inspired preaching and writings; but it is also true, that the same truths are communicated by the agency of the same Spirit to all Christians; <a href="//biblehub.com/john/16-12.htm">John 16:12-14</a>. No truth is now communicated to Christians which was not revealed to and by the inspired writers; but the same truths are imparted by means of their writings, and by the illumination of the Spirit to all the true friends of God.<p>By his Spirit - By the Holy Spirit, that was promised by the Saviour. <a href="/john/14-26.htm">John 14:26</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/john/15-26.htm">John 15:26-27</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/john/16-7.htm">John 16:7-14</a>. This proves:<p>(1) That people by nature are not able to discover the deep things of God - the truths which are needful to salvation.<p>(2) that the apostles were inspired by the Holy Spirit; and if so, then the Scriptures are inspired.<p>(3) that all Christians are the subjects of the teaching of the Holy Spirit; that these truths are made known to them by his illumination; and that but for this, they would remain in the same darkness as other men.<p>For the Spirit - The Holy Spirit, or the Spirit of God; see <a href="/1_corinthians/2-11.htm">1 Corinthians 2:11</a>.<p>Searcheth - This word does not fully express the force of the original &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#834;&#837;  ereuna. It means to search accurately, diligently, so as fully to understand; such profound research as to have thorough knowledge. So David uses the Hebrew word &#1495;&#1511;&#1512;  chaaqar in <a href="/psalms/139-1.htm">Psalm 139:1</a>. So the word is used to denote a careful and accurate investigation of secret and obscure things, in <a href="/1_peter/1-11.htm">1 Peter 1:11</a>. Compare <a href="/john/7-52.htm">John 7:52</a>; <a href="/romans/8-27.htm">Romans 8:27</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/2-23.htm">Revelation 2:23</a>, where it is used to denote that profound and accurate search by which the desires and feelings of the heart are known - implying the most profound knowledge of which we can have any conception; see <a href="/proverbs/20-27.htm">Proverbs 20:27</a>. Here it means, that the Holy Spirit has an intimate knowledge of all things. It is not to be supposed that he searches, or inquires as people do who are ignorant; but that he has an intimate and profound knowledge, such as is usually the result of a close and accurate search. The result is what the apostle means to state - the accurate, profound, and thorough knowledge, such as usually attends research. He does not state the mode in which it is obtained; but the fact. And he uses a word more emphatic than simple knowledge, because he designs to indicate that his knowledge is profound, entire, and thorough.<p>All things - All subjects; all laws; all events; all beings.<p>The deep things of God - He has a thorough knowledge of the hidden counsels or purposes of God; of all his plans and purposes. He sees all his designs. He sees all his councils; all his purposes in regard to the government of the universe, and the scheme of salvation. He knows all whom God designs to save; he sees all that they need; and he sees how the plan of God is suited to their salvation - This passage proves:<p>(1) That the Spirit is, in some respects, distinct from the Father, or from him who is here called God. Else how could he be said to search all things, even the deep purposes of God? To "search" implies "action, thought, personality." An attribute of God cannot be said to search. How could it be said of the justice, the goodness, the power, or the wisdom of God that it "searches," or "acts?" To search, is the action of an intelligent agent, and cannot be performed by an attribute.<p>(2) the Spirit is omniscient. He searches or clearly understands "all things" - the very definition of omniscience. He understands all the profound plans and counsels of God. And how can there be a higher demonstration of omniscience than to "know God?" - But if omniscient, the Holy Spirit is divine - for this is one of the incommunicable attributes of God; <a href="/1_chronicles/28-9.htm">1 Chronicles 28:9</a>; <a href="/psalms/139-1.htm">Psalm 139:1</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/17-10.htm">Jeremiah 17:10</a>.<p>(3) he is not a distinct being from God. There is a union between him and God, such as may be compared to the union between a man and his soul, <a href="/1_corinthians/2-11.htm">1 Corinthians 2:11</a>. God is one; and though he subsists as Father, Son, and Spirit, yet he is one God, <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a> - This passage is, therefore, a very important, and a decisive one in regard to the personality and divinity of the Holy Spirit. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. revealed &#8230; by &#8230; Spirit&#8212;The inspiration of thoughts (so far as truth essential to salvation is concerned) makes the Christian (1Co 3:16; 12:3; Mt 16:17; Joh 16:13; 1Jo 2:20, 27); that of words, the PROPHET (2Sa 23:1, 2; 1Ki 13:1, 5), "by the word of the Lord" (1Co 2:13; Joh 20:30, 31; 2Pe 1:21). The secrets of revelation are secret to some, not because those who know them will not reveal them (for indeed, the very notion of revelation implies an unveiling of what had been veiled), but because those to whom they are announced have not the will or power to comprehend them. Hence the Spirit-taught alone know these secrets (Ps 25:14; Pr 3:32; Joh 7:17; 15:15).<p>unto us&#8212;the "perfect" or fully matured in Christian experience (1Co 2:6). Intelligent men may understand the outline of doctrines; but without the Holy Spirit's revelation to the heart, these will be to them a mere outline&#8212;a skeleton, correct perhaps, but wanting life [Whatley, Cautions for the Times, 14], (Lu 10:21).<p>the Spirit searcheth&#8212;working in us and with our spirits (compare Ro 8:16, 26, 27).

His divine nature, attributes, and counsels. The Spirit delights to explore the infinite depths of His own divine mind, and then reveal them to us, according as we are capable of understanding them (De 29:29). This proves the personality and Godhead of the Holy Ghost. Godhead cannot be separated from the Spirit of God, as manhood cannot be separated from the Spirit of man [Bengel].<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_corinthians/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit; </span> God by his Spirit hath opened our understandings to understand the Holy Scriptures, the types and prophecies of Christ, and what the holy prophets have spoken of him both as to his person and offices. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">For the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God; </span> for the Holy Spirit being the third person in the blessed Trinity, and so equal with the Father and the Son, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">searcheth the deep things of God, </span> and so is able to reveal to us all the counsels of God, whatsoever God would have men to understand concerning the Lord Jesus Christ.

Should it be said, that since this wisdom is so hidden and mysterious, the doctrines of the Gospel are so unknown, so much out of the sight and understanding of men, how come any to be acquainted with them? The answer is ready, God has made a revelation of them, not only in his word, which is common to men, nor only to his ministers, but to private Christians and believers, <p>by his Spirit; which designs not the external revelation made in the Scriptures, though that also is by the Spirit; but the internal revelation and application of the truths of the Gospel to the souls of men, which is sometimes ascribed to the Father of Christ. <a href="/matthew/16-17.htm">Matthew 16:17</a> sometimes to Christ himself, <a href="/galatians/1-12.htm">Galatians 1:12</a> and sometimes to the Spirit of Christ, <a href="/ephesians/1-17.htm">Ephesians 1:17</a> and who guides into all truth, <a href="//biblehub.com/john/16-13.htm">John 16:13</a>, and here to the Father by the Spirit: <p>for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God; which does not suppose any ignorance of these things in the Spirit, antecedent to his searching of them; but his complete and perfect knowledge of them; even as God's searching of the hearts of men expresses his omniscience, and through knowledge of all that is in them: the "all things" the Spirit searches into, and has a perfect knowledge of, do not design in the utmost extent everything which comes within the compass of his infinite understanding; but every thing that is in, or belongs to the Gospel of Christ, even the more mysterious and sublime, as well as the more plain and easy doctrines: for the "deep things of God" intend not the perfections of his nature, which are past finding out unto perfection by men; nor the depths of his wise and righteous providence; but the mysterious doctrines of the Gospel, the fellowship of the mystery which was hid in God, his wise counsels of old concerning man's salvation, the scheme of things drawn in his eternal mind, and revealed in the word. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_corinthians/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{9}</span> But God hath revealed <i>them</i> unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit <span class="cverse3">{k}</span> searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.</span><p>(9) A question: if it surpasses the capacity of men, how can it be understood by any man, or how can you declare and preach it?
