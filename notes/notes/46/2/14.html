True psychology regards man as a trinity of natures. (See Note on <a href="/matthew/10-28.htm" title="And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.">Matthew 10:28</a>.) In accordance with this, St. Paul speaks of man as consisting of body (<span class= "ital">soma</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> soul (<span class= "ital">psyche</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> and spirit (<span class= "ital">pneuma</span>)<span class= "ital">;</span> the <span class= "ital">soma</span> is our physical nature; the <span class= "ital">psyche</span> is our intellectual nature, embracing also our desires and human affections; the <span class= "ital">pneuma</span> is our spiritual nature. Thus in each of us there is a somatical man, a psychical man, and a pneumatical man; and according as any one of those parts of the nature dominates over the other, so is the character of the individual person. One in whom the <span class= "ital">soma</span> is strongest is a “carnal,” or “fleshly,” man; one in whom the intellect or affections pre-dominate is a “natural,” or “psychic,” man; and one in whom the spirit rules (which it can do only when enlightened and guided by the Spirit of God, which acts on it) is a “spiritual” man. (See <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-23.htm" title="And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.">1Thessalonians 5:23</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Natural.</span>—That is, literally, that part of our nature which we call “mind,” and hence signifies that man in whom pure intellectual reason and the merely natural affections predominate. Now such a one cannot grasp spiritual truth any more than the physical nature, which is made to discern physical things, can grasp intellectual things. Spiritual truth appeals to the spirit of the man, and therefore is intelligible only to those who are “spiritual,” <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> in whom the <span class= "ital">pneuma</span> is not dormant, but quickened by the Holy <span class= "ital">Pneuma.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_corinthians/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/1_corinthians/2-14.htm" title="But the natural man receives not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness to him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.">1 Corinthians 2:14</a></span>. <span class="ital">But the natural man </span>— The man who has only the powers of nature, the faculties derived from Adam, but not a supernatural principle of saving grace; who has a soul in his body, (as the word <span class="greekheb">ψυχικος</span>, derived from <span class="greekheb">ψυχη</span>, <span class="ital">a soul, </span>implies,) but no divine inspiration in that soul; or who is not truly enlightened and renewed by the Word and Spirit of God, and therefore has no other way of obtaining knowledge but by his senses and natural understanding; <span class="ital">receiveth not </span>— Does not understand or apprehend; <span class="ital">the things of the Spirit of God — </span>Whether relating to his nature or kingdom. <span class="ital">For they are foolishness to him </span>— He is so far from understanding, that he utterly despises them. <span class="ital">Neither can he know them </span>— As he has not the will, so neither has he the power; <span class="ital">because they are spiritually discerned </span>— They can only be discerned by the aid of that Spirit, and by those spiritual senses which he has not. Some commentators consider these declarations of the apostle as being only applicable to mere <span class="ital">animal </span>or <span class="ital">sensual </span>persons, who are under the guidance and government of their natural senses, appetites, and passions; and it must be acknowledged that the word above mentioned, rendered <span class="ital">natural </span>in the beginning of this verse, is translated <span class="ital">sensual </span><a href="/james/3-15.htm" title="This wisdom descends not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish.">James 3:15</a>; <a href="/judges/1-19.htm" title="And the LORD was with Judah; and he drove out the inhabitants of the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron.">Jdg 1:19</a>. And yet it is certain that the word <span class="greekheb">ψυχη</span>, from which it is derived, frequently signifies the rational and immortal soul; even that soul which they <span class="ital">that kill the body, </span>cannot <span class="ital">kill, </span><a href="/matthew/10-28.htm" title="And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.">Matthew 10:28</a>; <a href="/matthew/10-39.htm" title="He that finds his life shall lose it: and he that loses his life for my sake shall find it.">Matthew 10:39</a>; and therefore the epithet formed from it may justly be considered as referring to the powers of the mind, as well as to the inferior faculties. Besides, though the word is rendered <span class="ital">sensual, </span>in the before-mentioned passages, yet in the latter of them (Judges 19) it is explained as signifying those <span class="ital">who have not the Spirit. </span>And it is evident that in this verse St. Paul is not opposing a man that is governed by his appetites and passions, or by his mere animal nature, and his prejudices arising therefrom, to one that is governed by his reason; or one destitute of consideration and judgment, and of amiable, moral qualities, to one possessed of them; but <span class="ital">a carnal </span>to a <span class="ital">spiritual </span>man; or a mere natural and unrenewed, to a truly enlightened and regenerated man. Indeed, “the apostle’s argument,” as Mr. Scott justly observes, “absolutely requires that by <span class="ital">the natural man, </span>we should understand the unregenerate man, however sagacious, learned, or abstracted from sensual indulgences, for he opposes him to the <span class="ital">spiritual </span>man: and the pride of carnal reasoning is at least as opposite to spirituality, as the most grovelling sensuality can be. No man, as naturally born into the world, and not supernaturally born again of the Spirit, <span class="ital">can see the kingdom of God, </span>or receive, in faith and love, the spiritual mysteries of redemption by the cross of Christ. To all unregenerate men, these things will, in one way or other, appear <span class="ital">foolishness, </span>uninteresting, unnecessary, inconsistent, absurd: and doubtless proud reasoners have scoffed at them, more than ever mere sensualists did. No ingenuity, address, or reasoning of the preacher can prevent this effect: no application of a man’s own mind, except in humble dependance on the teaching of the Holy Spirit, can enable him to perceive the real nature and glory of them. <span class="ital">For they are spiritually discerned </span>— That is, by the illuminating and sanctifying work of the Spirit of God upon the mind, by which a spiritual capacity is produced, which discerns, loves, admires, and delights in, the divine excellence of heavenly things. When this change has taken place, and a man’s spiritual senses have been matured by growth and exercise, he may be called <span class="ital">a spiritual man: </span>and he perceives the spiritual glory and excellence of every truth and precept in the Word of God; he distinguishes one object from another by a spiritual taste, or a kind of <span class="ital">extempore </span>judgment, and so he becomes a competent judge in these matters.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:10-16 God has revealed true wisdom to us by his Spirit. Here is a proof of the Divine authority of the Holy Scriptures, 2Pe 1:21. In proof of the Divinity of the Holy Ghost, observe, that he knows all things, and he searches all things, even the deep things of God. No one can know the things of God, but his Holy Spirit, who is one with the Father and the Son, and who makes known Divine mysteries to his church. This is most clear testimony, both to the real Godhead and the distinct person of the Holy Spirit. The apostles were not guided by worldly principles. They had the revelation of these things from the Spirit of God, and the saving impression of them from the same Spirit. These things they declared in plain, simple language, taught by the Holy Spirit, totally different from the affected oratory or enticing words of man's wisdom. The natural man, the wise man of the world, receives not the things of the Spirit of God. The pride of carnal reasoning is really as much opposed to spirituality, as the basest sensuality. The sanctified mind discerns the real beauties of holiness, but the power of discerning and judging about common and natural things is not lost. But the carnal man is a stranger to the principles, and pleasures, and actings of the Divine life. The spiritual man only, is the person to whom God gives the knowledge of his will. How little have any known of the mind of God by natural power! And the apostles were enabled by his Spirit to make known his mind. In the Holy Scriptures, the mind of Christ, and the mind of God in Christ, are fully made known to us. It is the great privilege of Christians, that they have the mind of Christ revealed to them by his Spirit. They experience his sanctifying power in their hearts, and bring forth good fruits in their lives.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But the natural man - &#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2;,  &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  psuchikos de anthro&#772;pos. The word "natural" here stands opposed evidently to "spiritual." It denotes those who are governed and influenced by the natural instincts; the animal passions and desires, in opposition to those who are influenced by the Spirit of God. It refers to unregenerate people; but it has also not merely the idea of their being unregenerate, but that of their being influenced by the animal passions or desires. See the note on <a href="/1_corinthians/15-44.htm">1 Corinthians 15:44</a>. The word "sensual" would correctly express the idea. The word is used by the Greek writers to denote that which man has in common with the brutes - to denote that they are under the influence of the senses, or the mere animal nature, in opposition to reason and conscience - Bretschneider. See <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-23.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:23</a>. Here it denotes that they are under the influence of the senses, or the animal nature, in opposition to being influenced by the Spirit of God. Macknight and Doddridge render it: "the animal man."<p>Whitby understands by it the man who rejects revelation, the man who is under the influence of carnal wisdom. The word occurs but six times in the New Testament; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-44.htm">1 Corinthians 15:44</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-44.htm">1 Corinthians 15:44</a>, <a href="/1_corinthians/15-46.htm">1 Corinthians 15:46</a>; <a href="/james/3-15.htm">James 3:15</a>; Jde 1:19.

In <a href="//biblehub.com/james/3-15.htm">James 3:15</a>, it is applied to wisdom: "This wisdom - is earthly, sensual, devilish." In Jde 1:19, it is applied to sensual persons, or those who are governed by the senses in opposition to those who are influenced by the Spirit: "These be they who separate themselves, sensual, having not the Spirit." The word here evidently denotes those who are under the influence of the senses; who are governed by the passions and the animal appetites, and natural desires; and who are uninfluenced by the Spirit of God. And it may be observed that this was the case with the great mass of the pagan world, even including the philosophers.<p>Receiveth not - &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;  ou dechetai, does not "embrace" or "comprehend" them. That is, he rejects them as folly; he does not perceive their beauty, or their wisdom; he despises them. He loves other things better. A man of intemperance does not receive or love the arguments for temperance; a man of licentiousness, the arguments for chastity; a liar, the arguments for truth. So a sensual or worldly man does not receive or love the arguments for religion.<p>The things of the Spirit of God - The doctrines which are inspired by the Holy Spirit, and the things which pertain to his influence on the heart and life. The things of the Spirit of God here denote all the things which the Holy Spirit produces.<p>Neither can he know them - Neither can he understand or comprehend them. Perhaps, also, the word "know" here implies also the idea of "loving," or "approving" of them, as it often does in the Scripture. Thus, to know the Lord often means to love him, to have a full, practical acquaintance with him. When the apostle says that the animal or sensual man cannot know those things, he may have reference to one of two things. Either:<p>(1) That those doctrines were not discoverable by human wisdom, or by any skill which the natural man may have, but were to be learned only by revelation. This is the main drift of his argument, and this sense is given by Locke and Whitby. Or,<p>(2) He may mean that the sensual the unrenewed man cannot perceive their beauty and their force, even after they are revealed to man, unless the mind is enlightened and inclined by the Spirit of God. This is probably the sense of the passage.<p>This is the simple affirmation of a fact - that while the man remains sensual and carnal, he cannot perceive the beauty of those doctrines. And this is a simple and well known fact. It is a truth - universal and lamentable - that the sensual man, the worldly man, the proud, haughty, and self-confident man; the man under the influence of his animal appetites - licentious, false, ambitious, and vain - does not perceive any beauty in Christianity. So the intemperate man perceives no beauty in the arguments for temperance; the adulterer, no beauty in the arguments for chastity; the liar, no beauty in the arguments for truth. It is a simple fact, that while he is intemperate, or licentious, or false, he can perceive no beauty in these doctrines.<p>But this does not prove that he has no natural faculties for perceiving the force and beauty of these arguments; or that he might not apply his mind to their investigation, and be brought to embrace them; or that he might not abandon the love of intoxicating drinks, and sensuality, and falsehood, and be a man of temperance, purity, and truth. He has all the natural faculties which are requisite in the case; and all the inability is his "strong love" of intoxicating drinks, or impurity, or falsehood. So of the sensual sinner. While he thus remains in love with sin, he cannot perceive the beauty of the plan of salvation, or the excellency of the doctrines of religion. He needs just the love of these things, and the hatred of sin. He needs to cherish the influences of the Spirit; to receive what He has taught, and not to reject it through the love of sin; he needs to yield himself to their influences, and then their beauty will be seen.<p>The passage here proves that while a man is thus sensual, the things of the Spirit will appear to him to be folly; it proves nothing about his ability, or his natural faculty, to see the excellency of these things, and to turn from his sin. It is the affirmation of a simple fact everywhere discernible, that the natural man does not perceive the beauty of these things; that while he remains in that state he cannot; and that if he is ever brought to perceive their beauty, it will be by the influence of the Holy Spirit. Such is his love of sin, that he never will be brought to see their beauty except by the agency of the Holy Spirit. "For wickedness perverts the judgment, and makes people err with respect to practical principles; so that no one can be wise and judicious who is not good." Aristotle, as quoted by Bloomfield.<p>They are spiritually discerned - That is, they are perceived by the aid of the Holy Spirit enlightening the mind and influencing the heart.<p>(The expression &#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  psuchikos anthro&#772;pos; has given rise to much controversy. Frequent attempts have been made to explain it, merely of the animal or sensual man. If this be the true sense, the doctrine of human depravity, in as far at least as this text may be supposed to bear upon it, is greatly invalidated. The apostle would seem to affirm only, that individuals, addicted to the gross indulgences of sense, are incapable of discerning and appreciating spiritual things. Thus, a large exception would be made in favor of all those who might be styled intellectual and moral persons, living above the inferior appetites, and directing their faculties to the candid investigation of truth. That the phrase, however, is to be explained of the natural or "unregenerate" man, whether distinguished for intellectual refinement, and external regard to morals, or degraded by animal indulgence, will appear evident from an examination of the passage.<p>The word in dispute comes from &#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#769;  psuche&#772;, which though it primarily signify the breath or animal life, is by no means confined to that sense, but sometimes embraces the mind or soul "as distinguished both from man's body and from his &#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;  pneuma, or spirit, breathed into him immediately by God" - See Parkhurst's Greek Lexicon. The etymology of the word does not necessarily require us, then, to translate it "sensual." The context therefore alone must determine the matter. Now the "natural man" is there opposed to the spiritual man, the &#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2;  psuchikos to the &#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2;  pneumatikos, and if the latter be explained of "him who is enlightened by the Holy Spirit" - who is regenerate - the former must be explained of him who is not enlightened by that Spirit, who is still in a state of nature; and will thus embrace a class far more numerous than the merely sensual part of mankind.<p>Farther; the general scope of the passage demands this view. The Corinthians entertained an excessive fondness for human learning and wisdom. They loved philosophical disquisition and oratorical display, and may therefore have been impatient of the "enticing words" of Paul. To correct their mistaken taste, the apostle asserts and proves the utter insufficiency of human wisdom, either to discover spiritual things, or to appreciate them when discovered. He exclaims "where is the 'wise'? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?" <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-17.htm">1 Corinthians 1:17</a>, <a href="/1_corinthians/1-31.htm">1 Corinthians 1:31</a>. Now it would be strange indeed, if in bringing his argument to a conclusion, he should simply assert, that "sensual" people were incapable of spiritual discernment. So lame and impotent a conclusion is not to be attributed to the apostle. The disputed phrase, therefore, must be understood of all unregenerate persons, however free from gross sin, or eminent in intellectual attainment. Indeed it is the "proud wisdom" of the world, and not its sensuality, that the apostle? throughout has chiefly in view. Add to all this; that the simplicity of the gospel has "in reality" met with more bitter opposition and pointed scorn, from people of worldly wisdom, than from people of the sensual class. Of the former, is it especially true that they have counted the gospel "foolishness" and contemptuously rejected its message.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. natural man&#8212;literally, "a man of animal soul." As contrasted with the spiritual man, he is governed by the animal soul, which overbears his spirit, which latter is without the Spirit of God (Jude 19). So the animal (English Version, "natural") body, or body led by the lower animal nature (including both the mere human fallen reason and heart), is contrasted with the Spirit-quickened body (1Co 15:44-46). The carnal man (the man led by bodily appetites, and also by a self-exalting spirit, estranged from the divine life) is closely akin; so too the "earthly." "Devilish," or "demon-like"; "led by an evil spirit," is the awful character of such a one, in its worst type (Jas 3:15).<p>receiveth not&#8212;though they are offered to him, and are "worthy of being received by all men" (1Ti 1:15).<p>they are foolishness unto him&#8212;whereas he seeks "wisdom" (1Co 1:22).<p>neither can he&#8212;Not only does he not, but he cannot know them, and therefore has no wish to "receive" them (Ro 8:7).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_corinthians/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> There are great disputes here, who is meant by <span class="bld">the natural man, </span> qucikov anyrwpov.

Thus, say they, the natural man is one who is a servant to his lusts and corruption, under the perfect government of his soul considered merely as natural, all whose motions in that estate of sin and corruption are inordinate.

Luther, as early as 1521, has some excellent remarks on the trichotomy (printed also in Delitzsch’s <span class="ital">bibl. Psychol.</span> p. 392 f.). He likens the <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span> to the <span class="ital">Sanctum sanctorum</span>, the <span class="greekheb">ψυχή</span> to the <span class="ital">Sanctum</span>, and the <span class="greekheb">σῶμα</span> to the <span class="ital">Atrium</span>.

We may add, that Hofmann is wrong in saying, with respect to this passage, that it has nothing whatever to do with the question about the dichotomy or trichotomy. It has to do with it, inasmuch as in virtue of the contrast between <span class="greekheb">ψυχικός</span> and <span class="greekheb">πνευματικός</span>, the <span class="greekheb">ψυχή</span> cannot be the seat and sphere of operation of the Divine Spirit, which is to be found rather in the human <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span>, and consequently must be conceived as specifically <span class="ital">distinct</span> from the latter.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[421] Luther’s gloss is: “The <span class="ital">natural</span> man is as he is <span class="ital">apart from grace</span>, albeit decked out as bravely as may be with all the reason, skill, sense, and faculty in the world.” Comp. Calovius, who insists with justice against Grotius, that <span class="greekheb">ψυχικός</span> and <span class="greekheb">σαρκικός</span> differ only “ratione <span class="ital">formalis</span> significationis.” Paul might have used <span class="greekheb">σαρκικός</span> here too (see on <a href="/1_corinthians/3-1.htm" title="And I, brothers, could not speak to you as to spiritual, but as to carnal, even as to babes in Christ.">1 Corinthians 3:1</a>); but <span class="greekheb">ψυχικός</span> naturally suggested itself to him as correlative to <span class="greekheb">δέχεσθαι</span>; for the <span class="greekheb">ψυχή</span> cannot be the <span class="ital">receptaculum</span> of that which is of the Spirit of God. According to Ewald, the word points to the Greek <span class="ital">philosophers</span>, being a <span class="ital">gentle</span> way of designating them.

It becomes to them what painting is to the blind, or music to the deaf. This elementary truth is again and again insisted on in Scripture, and ignored by sceptics (<a href="/romans/8-6.htm">Romans 8:6, 7</a>; <a href="/john/3-3.htm">John 3:3</a>; <a href="/john/6-44.htm">John 6:44, 45</a>; <a href="/john/14-17.htm">John 14:17</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/4-3.htm">2 Corinthians 4:3-6</a>). This verse is sometimes used to depreciate knowledge, reason, and intellect. On that abuse of the passage, see Hooker, 'Eccl. Pol.,' 3. 8:4-11, an admirable passage, which Bishop Wordsworth quotes at length. It is, perhaps, sufficient to say that if God has no need of human knowledge, he has still less need of human ignorance. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/1_corinthians/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>The natural man (&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;)<p>See on <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/11-4.htm">Romans 11:4</a>, on the distinction between &#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#769; soul, life, and &#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; spirit. The contrast is between a man governed by the divine Spirit and one from whom that Spirit is absent. But &#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; natural, is not equivalent to &#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; fleshy. Paul is speaking of natural as contrasted with spiritual cognition applied to spiritual truth, and therefore of the &#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#769; soul, as the organ of human cognition, contrasted with the &#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; spirit, as the organ of spiritual cognition. The man, therefore, whose cognition of truth depends solely upon his natural insight is &#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; natural, as contrasted with the spiritual man (&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;) to whom divine insight is imparted. In other words, the organ employed in the apprehension of spiritual truth characterizes the man. Paul therefore "characterizes the man who is not yet capable of understanding divine wisdom as &#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;, i.e., as one who possesses in his &#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#769; soul, simply the organ of purely human cognition, but has not yet the organ of religious cognition in the &#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; spirit" (Dickson). It is perhaps impossible to find an English word which will accurately render &#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;. Psychic is simply the Greek transcribed. We can do no better than hold by the A.V. natural.<p>Receiveth not (&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)<p>Not, does not understand, but does not admit them into his heart; thus, according to New Testament usage, when the word is used in connection with teaching.

"It is an utter perversion of such statements to maintain that there is in the natural man any organic, constitutional incapacity of spiritual perception requiring to be created in them by the Holy Spirit ....

Used only by Luke and Paul, and by the latter in this epistle only. By Luke, mostly of judicial examination: <a href="/luke/23-14.htm">Luke 23:14</a>; <a href="/acts/4-9.htm">Acts 4:9</a>; <a href="/acts/12-19.htm">Acts 12:19</a>; <a href="/acts/24-8.htm">Acts 24:8</a>; <a href="/acts/28-18.htm">Acts 28:18</a>. Of examining the Scriptures, <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/17-11.htm">Acts 17:11</a>, but with the sense of proving or coming to a judgment on. The fundamental idea of the word is examination, scrutiny, following up (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;) a series of objects or particulars in order to distinguish (&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;). This is its almost universal meaning in classical Greek. At Athens it was used technically in two senses: to examine magistrates with a view to proving their qualifications; and to examine persons concerned in a suit, so as to prepare the matter for trial, as a grand jury. The meaning judged is, at best, inferential, and the Rev. inserts examined in the margin. Bishop Lightfoot says: "&#x391;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; is neither to judge nor to discern; but to examine, investigate, inquire into, question, as it is rightly translated, <a href="/1_corinthians/9-3.htm">1 Corinthians 9:3</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-25.htm">1 Corinthians 10:25</a>, <a href="/1_corinthians/10-27.htm">1 Corinthians 10:27</a>. The apostle condemns all these impatient human praejudicia which anticipate the final judgment, reserving his case for the great tribunal, where at length all the evidence will be forthcoming and a satisfactory verdict can be given. Meanwhile the process of gathering evidence has begun; an &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; investigation is indeed being held, not, however, by these self-appointed magistrates, but by one who alone has the authority to institute the inquiry, and the ability to sift the facts" ("On a Fresh Revision of the New Testament").
