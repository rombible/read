Wherefore, to show that the gods of the heathen were mere creatures of the human imagination, the Jews, who used the Greek language, termed them <span class="greekheb">ειδωλα</span>, <span class="ital">idols. </span>By this word, likewise, they signified the pictures and statues which the heathen set up in their temples, as representations of their gods; and by giving them the appellation of <span class="ital">idols, </span>they declared their persuasion that the things of which they were the representations had no existence. Nevertheless, as the apostle knew that some of the heathen worshipped their dead ancestors, legislators, kings, &c., others of them the heavenly bodies, others certain kinds of brute animals, he cannot be understood to say that <span class="ital">an idol </span>is nothing, in the sense of its having no existence as a being, but of its having no existence as a god, and no share in the government of the world.” <span class="ital">For though there be that are called gods,</span> <span class="ital">whether in heaven or in earth </span>— Or even under the earth; for the heathen had not only their celestial and terrestrial, but likewise their infernal deities: <span class="ital">as there be gods many, and lords many </span>— Who are in their various subordinations adored by the Gentiles, and have great, though very absurd worship paid to them. <span class="ital">But to us </span>— Christians; <span class="ital">there is </span>— In the whole universe; <span class="ital">but one God </span>— One supreme essence; <span class="ital">the Father </span>— Of angels and men.

Much may be known, when nothing is known to good purpose. And those who think they know any thing, and grow vain thereon, are the least likely to make good use of their knowledge. Satan hurts some as much by tempting them to be proud of mental powers, as others, by alluring to sensuality. Knowledge which puffs up the possessor, and renders him confident, is as dangerous as self-righteous pride, though what he knows may be right. Without holy affections all human knowledge is worthless. The heathens had gods of higher and lower degree; gods many, and lords many; so called, but not such in truth. Christians know better. One God made all, and has power over all. The one God, even the Father, signifies the Godhead as the sole object of all religious worship; and the Lord Jesus Christ denotes the person of Emmanuel, God manifest in the flesh, One with the Father, and with us; the appointed Mediator, and Lord of all; through whom we come to the Father, and through whom the Father sends all blessings to us, by the influence and working of the Holy Spirit. While we refuse all worship to the many who are called gods and lords, and to saints and angels, let us try whether we really come to God by faith in Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>As concerning therefore ... - The parenthesis closes with <a href="/1_corinthians/8-3.htm">1 Corinthians 8:3</a>. The apostle now proceeds to the real question in debate, and repeats in this verse the question, and the admission that all had knowledge. The admission that all had knowledge proceeds through <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-4.htm">1 Corinthians 8:4-6</a>; and in <a href="/1_corinthians/8-7.htm">1 Corinthians 8:7</a> he gives the answer to it. In <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-4.htm">1 Corinthians 8:4-6</a> everything is admitted by Paul which they asked in regard to the real extent of their knowledge on this subject; and in <a href="/1_corinthians/8-7.htm">1 Corinthians 8:7</a> he shows that even on the ground of this admission, the conclusion would not follow that it was right to partake of the food offered in sacrifice in the temple of an idol.<p>The eating of those things ... - Whether it is right to eat them. Here the question is varied somewhat from what it was in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-1.htm">1 Corinthians 8:1</a>, but substantially the same inquiry is stated. The question was, whether it was right for Christians to eat the meat of animals that had been slain in sacrifice to idols.<p>We know - <a href="/1_corinthians/8-1.htm">1 Corinthians 8:1</a>. We Corinthians know; and Paul seems fully to admit that they had all the knowledge which they claimed, <a href="/1_corinthians/8-7.htm">1 Corinthians 8:7</a>. But his object was to show that even admitting that, it would not follow that it would be right to partake of that meat. It is well to bear in mind that the object of their statement in regard to knowledge was, to show that there could be no impropriety in partaking of the food. This argument the apostle answers in <a href="/1_corinthians/8-7.htm">1 Corinthians 8:7</a>.<p>That an idol is nothing - Is not the true God; is not a proper object of worship. We are not so stupid as to suppose that the block of wood, or the carved image, or the chiseled marble is a real intelligence and is conscious and capable of receiving worship, or benefiting its volaries. We fully admit, and know, that the whole thing is delusive; and there can be no danger that, by partaking of the food offered in sacrifice to them, we should ever be brought to a belief of the stupendous falsehood that they are true objects of worship, or to deny the true God. There is no doubt that the more intelligent pagan had this knowledge; and doubtless nearly all Christians possessed it, though a few who had been educated in the grosser views of paganism might still have regarded the idol with a superstitious reverence, For whatever might have been the knowledge of statesmen and philosophers on the subject, it was still doubtless true that the great mass of the pagan world did regard the dumb idols as the proper objects of worship, and supposed that they were inhabited by invisible spirits - the gods. For purposes of state, and policy, and imposition, the lawgivers and priests of the pagan world were careful to cherish this delusion; see <a href="/1_corinthians/8-7.htm">1 Corinthians 8:7</a>.<p>Is nothing - Is delusive; is imaginary.

There are no such gods as the pagans pretend to worship. There is but one God; and that fact is known to us all. The phrase "in the world" seems to be added by way of emphasis, to show the utter nothingness of idols; to explain in the most emphatic manner the belief that they had no real existence.<p>And that there is none other God but one - This was a great cardinal truth of religion; see the note at <a href="/mark/12-29.htm">Mark 12:29</a>; compare <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-5</a>. To keep this great truth in mind was the grand object of the Jewish economy; and this was so plain, and important, that the Corinthians supposed that it must be admitted by all. Even though they should partake of the meat that was offered in sacrifice to idols, yet they supposed it was not possible that any of them could forget the great cardinal truth that there was but one God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4.

The apostle having enlarged on the head of knowledge, which those who made an ill use of their Christian liberty urged in favour of their conduct; he returns to the subject in question, in relation to meats, <p>that are offered in sacrifice unto idols. The determinations of the Jewish schools concerning this affair are as follow, which admit of no manner of profit by them in any shape: <p>"a beast, the whole of which they offer to idols, is forbidden of profit, even its dung, and its bones, and its horns, and its hoofs, and its skin, all is forbid to be of any profit'' (y). <p>Again (z), <p>"flesh or wine, or fruits, which are brought in to be offered up to idols, are not forbidden to profit with, although they are brought into the idol's temple, until they offer them up before it;  "but when offered up before it"; they become an offering; and though they may return them, and bring them out, lo, these are forbidden for ever; and all that is found in an idol's temple, even water and salt, are forbidden of profit by the law,  , "and he that eats anything thereof" is to be beaten.'' <p>Once more (a), <p>"an Israelite that lifts up a cheese to worship it, but does not worship it, but a Gentile worships it, it is forbidden of profit, became the lifting of it up is an action; and so if he lifts up an egg, and a Gentile comes and worships it, it is forbidden; he that cuts a gourd, or any such thing, and worships it, it is forbidden, &amp;c.'' <p>But by these decrees we Christians are not bound; <p>we know that an idol is nothing in the world; among the things created by God in the world; for though the matter of it may be of God, the form is of men; nor has it any share in the government of the world: and though that of which it may be made, as gold, silver, brass, &amp;c. is something; yet as it is a form and representation of God, it is nothing, because there can be no representation of the invisible God; it is nothing, that is, it has no divinity in it, it is no God. Though it may have an existence, as the sun, moon, and stars, yet not divinity; and in that sense nothing. The apostle here speaks the language of the Jewish doctors, who say (b), <p>"why dost thou envy an idol?  , "since it is nothing, or there is nothing it."'' <p>And again (c), <p>"the Rabbins say, since  , "there is nothing in an idol", why do they call them deities;'' <p>Very likely the apostle may have reference to  the Hebrew word for idols, which signifies things of nought, that are good for nothing, are of no value, and are as nothing, <a href="/isaiah/2-20.htm">Isaiah 2:20</a>. <p>And that there is none other God but one. This clause may be considered either as a reason of the former, why an idol is nothing, is no deity, is no God, "for there is none other God but one", as it may be rendered; or as a part of what believers know; for as they know an idol is nothing, so they know, both from reason and revelation, from the books of the Old and New Testament, that there is but one God, and consequently that idols are nothing, and that they cannot defile them, nor anything that is offered to them. <p>continued...<a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_corinthians/8.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{2}</span> As concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> idols, we know that an idol <i>is</i> <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> nothing in the world, and that <i>there is</i> none other God but one.</span><p>(2) The application of that answer to things offered to idols: I grant, he says, that an idol is indeed a vain imagination, and that there is but one God and Lord, and therefore that food cannot be made either holy or profane by the idol.
