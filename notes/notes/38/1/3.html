It is very desirable to have the Lord of hosts for our friend, and very dreadful to have him for our enemy. Review what is past, and observe the message God sent by his servants, the prophets, to your fathers. Turn ye now from your evil ways, and from your evil doings. Be persuaded to leave your sins, as the only way to prevent approaching ruin. What is become of our fathers, and of the prophets that preached to them? They are all dead and gone. Here they were, in the towns and countries where we live, passing and repassing in the same streets, dwelling in the same houses, trading in the same shops and exchanges, worshipping God in the same places. But where are they? When they died, there was not an end of them; they are in eternity, in the world of spirits, the unchangeable world to which we hasten apace. Where are they? Those of them who lived and died in sin, are in torment. Those who lived and died in Christ, are in heaven; and if we live and die as they did, we shall be with them shortly and eternally. If they minded not their own souls, is that a reason why their posterity should ruin theirs also? The prophets are gone. Christ is a Prophet that lives for ever, but all other prophets have a period put to their office. Oh that this consideration had its due weight; that dying ministers are dealing with dying people about their never-dying souls, and an awful eternity, upon the brink of which both are standing! In another world, both we and our prophets shall live for ever: to prepare for that world ought to be our great care in this. The preachers died, and the hearers died, but the word of God died not; not one jot or title of it fell to the ground; for he is righteous.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/zechariah/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Therefore say thou - Literally, "And thou sayest," that is, this having been so, it follows that thou sayest or must say, "Turn ye unto Me." In some degree they had turned to God, for whose sake they had returned to their land; and again when, after some negligence <a href="//biblehub.com/haggai/1-2.htm">Haggai 1:2-11</a>, they renewed the building of the temple, and God had said, "I am with you" <a href="/haggai/1-13.htm">Haggai 1:13</a>. But there needed yet a more inward, more complete turning, whereon God promises a yet nearer presence, as Malachi repeats the words <a href="//biblehub.com/malachi/3-7.htm">Malachi 3:7</a>, and James exhorts, "Draw nigh to God and He will draw nigh to you" <a href="/james/4-8.htm">James 4:8</a>. Those who have turned to God need ever to turn more into the center of the narrow way. As the soul opens itself more to God, God, whose communication of Himself is ever hindered only by our closing the door of our hearts against Him, enters more into it.

So the Targum, "return to my worship": this is not the condition of what follows, but what follows is the motive and encouragement to this: <p>and I will turn unto you, saith the Lord of hosts; to dwell among them, manifest himself unto and protect them. Three times the phrase, "the Lord of hosts", is used in this verse: it may be with respect to the three Persons in the Godhead, Father, Son, and Spirit; who manifest themselves unto, and take up their abode with, such as love the Lord, and keep his commandments; see <a href="/john/14-21.htm">John 14:21</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/zechariah/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Therefore say thou unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> Turn ye unto me, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will turn unto you, saith the LORD of hosts.</span><p>(d) Let your fruits declare that you are God's people, and that he has wrought in you by his Spirit, and mortified you: for otherwise man has no power to return to God, but God must convert him; Jer 31:18 La 5:21 Isa 31:6 45:21</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/zechariah/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">3</span>. <span class="ital">saith the Lord of hosts</span>] See note on <a href="/haggai/2-6.htm" title="For thus said the LORD of hosts; Yet once, it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land;">Haggai 2:6</a>. In this verse the phrase occurs three times.

The man riding upon a red horse, the Leader of the company of horsemen, appears again in <a href="/zechariah/1-10.htm" title="And the man that stood among the myrtle trees answered and said, These are they whom the LORD has sent to walk to and fro through the earth.">Zechariah 1:10</a>, where the circumstance of his “standing among the myrtle-trees” is repeated, in order to identify him with the horseman of <a href="/zechariah/1-8.htm" title="I saw by night, and behold a man riding on a red horse, and he stood among the myrtle trees that were in the bottom; and behind him were there red horses, speckled, and white.">Zechariah 1:8</a>. In <a href="/zechariah/1-11.htm" title="And they answered the angel of the LORD that stood among the myrtle trees, and said, We have walked to and fro through the earth, and, behold, all the earth sits still, and is at rest.">Zechariah 1:11</a> he is called “the Angel of the Lord;” but to make it clear that he is the same person who was previously described as “a man,” his “standing among the myrtle trees” is again mentioned. Having thus been defined as the angel of the Lord (and he is the only person throughout the vision to whom that name is given) he is referred to in the next verse, <a href="/zechariah/1-12.htm" title="Then the angel of the LORD answered and said, O LORD of hosts, how long will you not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, against which you have had indignation these three score and ten years?">Zechariah 1:12</a>, by that title only, there being no further need to mention the circumstance of his standing among the myrtle trees, which was only introduced for the purpose of identifying him with the “man” of <a href="/zechariah/1-8.htm" title="I saw by night, and behold a man riding on a red horse, and he stood among the myrtle trees that were in the bottom; and behind him were there red horses, speckled, and white.">Zechariah 1:8</a>; <a href="/zechariah/1-10.htm" title="And the man that stood among the myrtle trees answered and said, These are they whom the LORD has sent to walk to and fro through the earth.">Zechariah 1:10</a>.

If this view be adopted, then only one other angel appears upon the scene, “the angel that talked or communed with me” (<a href="/zechariah/1-9.htm" title="Then said I, O my lord, what are these? And the angel that talked with me said to me, I will show you what these be.">Zechariah 1:9</a>; <a href="/context/zechariah/1-13.htm" title="And the LORD answered the angel that talked with me with good words and comfortable words....">Zechariah 1:13-14</a>), who on this supposition stands, as it were, outside in this as he does in all the subsequent visions, and is only employed to interpret them to the prophet.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the myrtles</span>] The myrtle is said to be indigenous to Palestine. That it abounded in the neighbourhood of Jerusalem at this period of Jewish history we learn incidentally, from the description of the Feast of Tabernacles, which was held under Ezra and Nehemiah. “Go forth,” so the proclamation ran, “unto the mount, and fetch olive-branches, and pine-branches, and myrtle-branches, and palm-branches, and branches of thick trees, to make booths, as it is written.” <a href="/nehemiah/8-15.htm" title="And that they should publish and proclaim in all their cities, and in Jerusalem, saying, Go forth to the mount, and fetch olive branches, and pine branches, and myrtle branches, and palm branches, and branches of thick trees, to make booths, as it is written.">Nehemiah 8:15</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in the bottom</span>] i.e. the low, deep valley, which appears to have been the favourite <span class="ital">habitat</span> of the myrtle. Comp. “litora myrtetis lætissima,” “amantes litora myrtos.” Virgil, Georg. ii. 112, iv. 124. Here it may well have been the valley of the Kedron. Others render, but with less probability, “the shady (place).” The idea that the “tabernacle” or dwelling-place of God is intended has nothing to recommend it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">red horses, speckled, and white</span>] With respect to the first and last of the colours, “red,” i.e. bay or chestnut, and “white,” there is no doubt. What exactly the intermediate colour is, “speckled,” or “bay” (margin), “sorrel,” R.V., must remain uncertain. Much ingenuity has been expended in endeavouring to give a meaning to the various colours of the horses. But inasmuch as the horsemen have been on the same mission, <a href="/zechariah/1-10.htm" title="And the man that stood among the myrtle trees answered and said, These are they whom the LORD has sent to walk to and fro through the earth.">Zechariah 1:10</a>, and all bring back the same report, <a href="/zechariah/1-11.htm" title="And they answered the angel of the LORD that stood among the myrtle trees, and said, We have walked to and fro through the earth, and, behold, all the earth sits still, and is at rest.">Zechariah 1:11</a>, and no reference is made to the colour of their horses by the angel who interprets the vision, it may fairly be regarded as a detail, to which no special importance is to be attached. We may say with Calvin (and it is a remark of general application to the visions and parables both of the Old Testament and of the New), “Si contenti simus mediocritate, nihil hic erit adeo perplexum, quin saltem facile sit summam totius vaticinii colligere. Sed multum nocuit curiositas interpretum, qui dum excutiunt singulas syllabas, pueriliter ludunt in multis.” His own view is, that the obscurity in which the vision is shrouded, the dark night, the low valley, the sombre myrtles, is intended to remind the prophet that God’s judgments are unsearchable and His ways past finding out, while the angel riders are a help to his human weakness to understand how, like a king whose couriers are continually passing to and fro throughout his dominions, the Almighty is intimately acquainted with all that is done upon earth, and the different coloured horses picture to his mind the truth, that all human events, whatever be their complexion, are alike under the cognisance and control of the never-failing Providence, which ordereth all things both in heaven and earth; and we may add, however diverse they appear, are all working harmoniously to accomplish His will.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/zechariah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Say thou unto them</span>. The prophet shows why he has reminded them of their forefathers' sins and punishment. Saith the Lord of hosts. The expression recurs three times in this verse; it denotes the almightiness and infinite resources of God (see note A in the appendix to Archdeacon Perowne's edition of this prophet). Its constant repetition, as in Haggai, gives a certain heaviness to the prophet's style. <span class="cmt_word">Turn</span> (<span class="accented">return</span>) <span class="cmt_word">ye unto me</span>. He calls the people to repentance, partly, doubtless, with a view to their taking an active part in rebuilding the temple, thus carrying on the exhortations of Haggai, but also with reference to their general indevotion and laxity which Ezra afterwards had to reprove (see <a href="/ezra/9-2.htm">Ezra 9:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Saith the Lord of hosts;</span> literally, (<span class="accented">it is</span>) <span class="accented">the utterance of Jehovah of hosts.</span> This is a more threatening form than the mere "saith" in the other two places in this verse. <span class="cmt_word">And I will turn (</span><span class="accented">return</span>) <span class="cmt_word">unto you (</span><a href="/malachi/3-7.htm">Malachi 3:7</a>). God promises his favour on their repentance and better conduct; as Haggai had been commissioned to proclaim a return of fruitful seasons as soon as the people obeyed his word and attended diligently to the work before them (<a href="/haggai/2-19.htm">Haggai 2:19</a>). They were called now to attend to the pure worship of the Lord, as the sole condition of prosperity (comp. <a href="/2_chronicles/30-6.htm">2 Chronicles 30:6</a>; <a href="/james/4-8.htm">James 4:8</a>). It has been well observed that when it is said, "Turn ye unto me," etc., we are reminded of our free will; and when we cry, "Turn us, good Lord, and we shall be turned," we acknowledge the need of God's preventing grace. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/habakkuk/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div><a href="/habakkuk/1-1.htm">Habakkuk 1:1</a> contains the heading not only to ch. 1 and 2, but to the whole book, of which ch. 3 forms an integral part.
