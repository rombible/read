This represented the low, melancholy condition of the Jewish church. A man like a warrior sat on a red horse, in the midst of this shady myrtle-grove. Though the church was in a low condition, Christ was present in the midst, ready to appear for the relief of his people. Behind him were angels ready to be employed by him, some in acts of judgment, others of mercy, others in mixed events. Would we know something of the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, we must apply, not to angels, for they are themselves learners, but to Christ himself. He is ready to teach those humbly desirous to learn the things of God. The nations near Judea enjoyed peace at that time, but the state of the Jews was unsettled, which gave rise to the pleading that followed; but mercy must only be hoped for through Christ. His intercession for his church prevails. The Lord answered the Angel, this Angel of the covenant, with promises of mercy and deliverance. All the good words and comfortable words of the gospel we receive from Jesus Christ, as he received them from the Father, in answer to the prayer of his blood; and his ministers are to preach them to all the world. The earth sat still, and was at rest. It is not uncommon for the enemies of God to be at rest in sin, while his people are enduring correction, harassed by temptation, disquieted by fears of wrath, or groaning under oppression and persecution. Here are predictions which had reference to the revival of the Jews after the captivity, but those events were shadows of what shall take place in the church, after the oppression of the New Testament Babylon is ended.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/zechariah/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I saw in the night - that is, that following on "the twenty-fourth day." The darkness of the night perhaps was chosen, as agreeing with the dimness of the restored condition. Night too is, Dionysius), "through the silence of the senses and of the fancy, more suited for receiving divine revelations."<p>A man riding upon a red horse - The man is an angel of God, appearing in form of man, as Daniel says, "The man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, touched me" <a href="/daniel/9-21.htm">Daniel 9:21</a>. He is doubtless the same who appeared to Joshua in form of man, preparing thereby for the revelation of God manifest in the flesh - He, before whom Joshua fell on his face and in him worshiped God, through whom also God required the same tokens of reverence as He had from Moses. "Joshua lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold there stood a man over against him with a sword drawn in his hand, who said, as Captain of the Lord's host am I come" (<a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/5-13.htm">Joshua 5:13-15</a>. See the note on "the Angel of the Lord" in Dr. Pusey's Daniel the Prophet, pp. 519-525). He rides here, as Leader of the host who follow Him; to Him the others report, and He instructs the Angel who instructs the prophet. Red, being the color of blood, symbolizes doubtless "the vengeance of God to be inflicted on the enemies of the Jews for their sins committed against the Jews" (Dionysius), exceeding the measure of chastisement allowed by God. It probably was Michael <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/10-13.htm">Daniel 10:13</a>, who is entitled in Daniel, "your prince <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/10-21.htm">Daniel 10:21</a>, the great prince which standeth up for the children of thy people" .<p>And he was standing - Almost as we say, stationary, abiding in that one place. The description is repeated <a href="/zechariah/1-10.htm">Zechariah 1:10</a> apparently as identifying this angel, and so he and the "angel of the <a href="/zechariah/1-11.htm">Zechariah 1:11</a> Lord" are probably one.<p>The myrtle trees - from their fragrance and lowness, probably symbolize the Church, as at once yielding a sweet odor, and in a low estate, or lowly. The natural habits of the myrtle make it the fitter symbol.<p>And behind him - The relation of the Angel as their chief is represented by their following him. This is consistent with their appearing subsequently as giving report to him. The red and white horses are well-known symbols of war and glory, whence He who sits on "the white horse" <a href="/revelation/6-2.htm">Revelation 6:2</a> in the revelations, "went forth conquering and to conquer." The remaining color is somewhat uncertain. If it be ashen gray, it would correspond to the pale horse  of the revelations, and the union of the two colors, black and white, is calculated to be a symbol of a chequered state of things, whereas a mingled color like "chestnut" is not suggestive of any symbol. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/zechariah/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. by night&#8212;The Jews begin their day with sunset; therefore the night which preceded the twenty-fourth day of the month is meant (Zec 1:7).<p>a man&#8212;Jehovah, the second person of the Trinity, manifested in man's form, an earnest of the incarnation; called the "angel of Jehovah" (Zec 1:11, 12), "Jehovah the angel of the covenant" (Mal 3:1; compare Ge 16:7 with Zec 1:13; Ge 22:11 with Zec 1:12; Ex 3:2 with Zec 1:4). Being at once divine and human, He must be God and man in one person.<p>riding&#8212;implying swiftness in executing God's will in His providence; hastening to help His people.<p>red horse&#8212;the color that represents bloodshed: implying vengeance to be inflicted on the foes of Israel (compare 2Ki 3:22; Isa 63:1, 2; Re 6:4); also fiery zeal.<p>among the myrtle trees&#8212;symbol of the Jewish Church: not a stately cedar, but a lowly, though fragrant, myrtle. It was its depressed state that caused the Jews to despond; this vision is designed to cheer them with better hopes.

The myrtle delights in low places and the banks of waters [Pembellus].

Some angels ("the red horses") exercised offices of vengeance; others ("the white"), those of joy; others ("the speckled"), those of a mixed character (compare Zec 6:2, 3). God has ministers of every kind for promoting the interests of His Church.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/zechariah/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">I saw:</span> in a vision God communicates his word, mind, or will to the prophet. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">By night; </span> either literally, it was by night that Zechariah had this vision, or with this it may note the obscurity and mysteriousness of the vision, for it may be emblematical, as the myrtles and the bottom are. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Behold; </span> mark well what I saw, as now I relate it to you. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">A man</span>; one in human shape, Christ Jesus in shape of a man so he appeared to Ezekiel, <span class="bld"><a href="/ezekiel/1-26.htm" title="And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone: and on the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above on it.">Ezekiel 1:26</a> 40:3</span>\, and to Daniel, <span class="bld"><a href="/daniel/7-13.htm" title="I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.">Daniel 7:13</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Riding; </span> in a posture of readiness, speed, and resolution to help his people, and to appear for them in some tokens of greatness and majesty, <span class="bld"><a href="/psalms/45-4.htm" title="And in your majesty ride prosperously because of truth and meekness and righteousness; and your right hand shall teach you terrible things.">Psalm 45:4</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Upon a red horse:</span> both the beast is noted, a horse, bold, strong, speedy, and gallant; and the colour is noted also; in the same colour he appeared to Isaiah, see <span class="bld"><a href="/context/isaiah/63-1.htm" title="Who is this that comes from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah? this that is glorious in his apparel, traveling in the greatness of his strength?

Or, "that night" (m); the night of the twenty fourth of Sebat; a proper and usual time for visions; and it may denote the obscurity of the vision, as it was in some respects to the prophet; and the state of the church at this time, it being a night season with it, and in a low estate; and the care that the Lord, who is Israel's Keeper, has of them in such seasons, being in the midst of them: <p>and behold! this is prefixed to the vision, to denote the wonderfulness of it, and to excite attention to it; there being something in it not only amazing, but of moment and importance: <p>a man riding upon a red horse; not any mere "man", as Alexander on his Bucephalus, as Abarbinel interprets it; and so Arias Montanus, as Sanctius on the place observes; though the time this vision refers to, and the state of the Jews then, will not admit of such an interpretation; for at this time all the earth was still and at rest, there were no wars in it, <a href="/zechariah/1-11.htm">Zechariah 1:11</a> which agrees not with the times of Alexander, and of his reign, which was wholly spent in war; and the whole world in a manner was involved in it by him; but best agrees with the times of Cyrus and Darius, after they had subdued the Babylonian monarchy: besides, the Jews were now in a very low estate, like a grove of myrtle trees in a bottom, plain, or valley; and not only surrounded and overtopped by other states and kingdoms, which were greatly superior to them; but oppressed by their enemies, who hindered them in the rebuilding of their city and temple; whereas this was not their case in the times of Alexander, when they were in better circumstances, and which were two hundred years after this; nor was he so very beneficial and serviceable to the Jews, as to be represented, in such a vision, as in the midst of them, for their relief and protection; but an angel of the Lord is here meant, as this man is expressly called, <a href="/zechariah/1-11.htm">Zechariah 1:11</a> and not a created angel; for he is distinguished from the angel that talked with the prophet, <a href="/zechariah/1-9.htm">Zechariah 1:9</a>. The Jews, as Jerom relates, think that the Angel Michael is meant, by whom they understand a created angel; for otherwise, if they took him to be, as he is, the Son of God, the Archangel, the Head of principalities, who is, as his name signifies, like unto God, and equal to him, it would not be amiss: and it is usual for a divine Person to be called the Angel of the Lord, as was he that called to Abraham when sacrificing his son, and to Moses out of the bush; and who went before the Israelites in the wilderness, and who is called the Angel of God's presence, and the messenger and Angel of the covenant; and the ancient Jews themselves own that a divine Person is here meant; for, on quoting these words, "I saw a man", &amp;c. they say (n), there is no man but the holy blessed God; as it is said, "the Lord is a man of war, the Lord is his name"; and though he is distinguished from the Lord of hosts, <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/1-12.htm">Zechariah 1:12</a>, the reason of this (or otherwise it is the title of this angel also, see <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/12-4.htm">Hosea 12:4</a>,) is because he here appears in the form of a man; and because of his office as an intercessor and advocate for his people, <a href="/zechariah/1-12.htm">Zechariah 1:12</a> a character which well agrees with Christ, who is the advocate with the Father for his saints, and whoever lives to make intercession for them, and is always heard and answered with good and comfortable words: and he is called a "man"; not that he is a mere man, or was really man when this vision was seen; but he then appeared in a human form, because he should become man, and quickly would be, as it was purposed, prophesied, and agreed he should be: and he is represented as "riding", to denote his majesty and glory as a king, or as a general of an army, in which he rode prosperously; see <a href="/psalms/45-4.htm">Psalm 45:4</a> as also his readiness, swiftness, and haste he made to help and save his people; as the people of the Jews, in this their present time of distress, being opposed and hindered in building their city, in particular; so, in general, all his people, in whatsoever case or circumstances they may be: thus riding, when ascribed to a divine Person, is an emblem of haste and quick dispatch, to assist and relieve the distressed; see <a href="/deuteronomy/33-26.htm">Deuteronomy 33:26</a> so Christ, who here appears as a man, was ready and forward, in the council and covenant of grace, to agree to become man, and be the surety of his people, and die in their place and stead, in order to save them: his frequent appearances in a human form, before his incarnation, show how willing and ready he was really to assume the human nature; and as soon as the time appointed for it was up, he tarried not; when the fulness of time was come, God sent him, and he came at once, and immediately; and as soon as possible he went about the business he came upon, took delight and pleasure in it, was constant at it till he had finished it; and even his sufferings and death, which were disagreeable to nature, considered in themselves, were wished and longed for, and cheerfully submitted to by him: and he is quick in all his motions to help his people in all their times of need; nor can any difficulties prevent him giving an early and speedy relief; he comes to them leaping on the mountains, and skipping on the hills; and at the last day he will come quickly to put them into the possession of salvation he has wrought out for them; and will be a swift witness for them, and against wicked men that hate them, and oppose them: and he is upon a "red horse", signifying either his incarnation, and his bloody sufferings and death; and his taking peace from the earth when on it, not intentionally, but eventually, through the wickedness of men; see <a href="/revelation/6-4.htm">Revelation 6:4</a> or his indignation against his enemies, and his wrath and vengeance upon them, and the destruction of them; and may have a particular reference to those who opposed the building of the temple; see <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/63-1.htm">Isaiah 63:1</a>, <p>and he stood among the myrtle trees which were in the bottom: by the "myrtle trees" may be meant the Israelites, as Kimchi interprets it; and that either as in Babylon, which he supposes is designed by "the bottom"; agreeably to the Targum, which paraphrases the words, "and he stood among the myrtle trees which are in Babylon"; or rather, as now returned to their own land; and so may denote the low estate and condition in which they were when they began to rebuild the temple, being feeble, and opposed by their enemies, mightier than they; but yet, inasmuch as the Lord was in the midst of them, they had encouragement to go on in the work, as is suggested in <a href="//biblehub.com/haggai/2-3.htm">Haggai 2:3</a>, though the saints and people of God in general may be here meant by the "myrtle trees"; and the ancient Jews (o) interpret them of the righteous, saying, there are no myrtle trees but the righteous; and give this as a reason why Esther was called Hadassah, <a href="/esther/2-7.htm">Esther 2:7</a> which signifies a myrtle tree, because this is the name of the righteous (p); and these may fitly be compared to such trees for their goodliness and beauty to look at, for their sweet and fragrant smell, for their verdure and greenness, and for their flourishing in valleys and watery places (q), signified here by "the bottom"; all which is true of the saints, who are pleasant plants, comely through Christ's comeliness; whose graces, when in exercise, send forth a sweet smell; whose prayers are odours, and whose good works are acceptable, being done in faith; whose leaves never wither, and who flourish much, being planted by the river of divine love; and in whom the grace of God ever remains, and they persevere in grace to the end: these may be said to be "in the bottom"; or in a low estate; not only before conversion, but after; when corruptions prevail, temptations are strong, grace is weak; God hides his face, Christ is absent, and the Spirit withdraws his influences; and so it is true of the church in general, when under persecution, or pestered with false teachers, and when the life and power of religion are almost gone; and yet even then Christ stands in the midst of them, to sympathize with them, and as ready to help and assist them, to deliver them out of their troubles, to protect them from their enemies, and to restore them to their former state and condition. A grove of myrtle trees in a plain, in which they delight, being dark and shady, is thought by some to be an emblem of this world, in which there is a mixture of good and bad men; and of the care of Providence over human affairs, consulting the good of man, especially the raising up of the church of God out of a low estate by Christ, and his apostles, and other ministers of the word, performing their offices, according to the different abilities and gifts God has bestowed upon them (r): <p>and behind him were there red horses, speckled and white; that is, with riders on them. Some (s) Jewish writers interpret this vision of the four kingdoms; and understand by the red horse with the man upon it, in the former clause, the Babylonian monarchy, of which Nebuchadnezzar was the head; and, by these three sorts here, the Medes, Greeks, and Romans, by inverting the order of them; they interpreting the white horses with the riders on them of the Medes and Persians; who were kind to the Jews, and under whom they were dismissed from their captivity, and their temple rebuilt: the speckled, or those of different colours, the Macedonians or Grecians; some of which were friends, and kind and benevolent to the Jews; and others cruel persecutors of them; and the red, the Romans, who were bloody, and slew multitudes of them, and destroyed their city and temple: but others, as Jerom observes, who relates the above sense, keep the order of the text, and explain the particulars of it thus; the red horse on which the man rode, and the red horses behind him, of the Assyrians and Chaldeans, who were sanguine; the one carried away the ten tribes under Shalmaneser; and the other the two tribes of Judah and Benjamin, burning the city of Jerusalem, and laying waste the temple; the speckled, or those of various colours, the Medes and Persians; some of whom were mild and gentle, as Cyrus, and Darius the son of Hystaspes, and Ahasuerus, whom the Greeks call Artaxerxes, under whom was the history of Esther; and others were cruel, as Cambyses, &amp;c.: those who think that Alexander the great is meant on the red horse suppose that those that succeeded him are meant by the other horses of various colours; namely, the Lagidae and the Seleucidae, or the kings of Egypt and Syria, who were sometimes very fierce and furious, and sometimes very friendly to the Jews; at least different kings, and at different times: but it seems better to interpret them of saints, the godly and faithful followers of Christ; not only the godly among the Jews, who were made as his goodly horse in the battle, <a href="/zechariah/10-3.htm">Zechariah 10:3</a> but the church and people of God in general, who are compared to a company of horses in Pharaoh's chariot, Sol 1:9, for their strength, courage, serviceableness, and the value Christ has them: thus, as he is elsewhere represented as riding on a white horse, under the Gospel dispensation, as the general of an army, and mighty conqueror; so the armies of heaven that follow him on white horses, and clothed in white, are the called, and faithful, and chosen, <a href="/revelation/17-14.htm">Revelation 17:14</a> and some of these being described by red horses, with riders on them, may signify, such who have been called to shed their blood, and lay down their lives, for Christ and his Gospel, and their profession of it, even the martyrs of Jesus; and others by speckled horses, or of various colours, may intend such professors of religion, who, though not called to die for Christ, yet suffer persecution in various ways, both by reproach and affliction; and whose lives may be a chequered work of comforts and troubles, of prosperity and adversity: and others by white horses may point at such who are not only clothed with fine linen, clean and white, the righteousness of the saints; and who are more than conquerors through Christ, who has loved them, which are characters common to all saints; but who enjoy a great deal of liberty, peace, and prosperity, all their days. Some (t) restrain this to the apostles of Christ, and succeeding ministers of the word; and observe, that as horses carry men and other things into the various parts of the world, so the ministers of the Gospel bear the name of Christ, and carry his Gospel into the whole world; and as horses do not go into any part of it of themselves, but as they are directed by their masters, so the Gospel ministers are sent under the direction of Christ, some here, and some there; and as horses going through towns and villages are mostly annoyed by the barking of dogs, which yet they regard not, so as to stop their speed; thus likewise faithful preachers are followed with the calumnies of wicked men, with their scoffs and jeers, reproaches and persecutions; but none of these things move them, or cause them to desist from their work; and as Christ the Son of God stood among these horses, so he is, and has promised to be, with his ministering servants unto the end of the world; and as they are like horses, docile and laborious, so the various colours of these may have respect to them; some of whom are called to resist even unto blood; and others to various trials; as well as they have different gifts, and are of different usefulness, and all of them at last victorious over their enemies; and are under Christ their Head, and are ready to do his will in whatsoever he directs them; though the more commonly received opinion is, that angels are designed, and as it seems from <a href="/zechariah/1-10.htm">Zechariah 1:10</a> compared with <a href="/zechariah/6-1.htm">Zechariah 6:1</a> see also <a href="/2_kings/2-11.htm">2 Kings 2:11</a> signified by horses, for their strength, courage, swiftness, serviceableness, and disposition for war; and these different colours may represent the different state and condition of the nations with whom they were concerned, and to whom they were sent, as cruel or kind, to the people of God; and their different employments and services, both to help the saints, and render vengeance to their enemies; and the various offices they perform, with respect to Christ and his people, in things temporal and spiritual; and the place and situation of these horses being "behind" Christ may denote his superiority over them: he is superior to all monarchs and monarchies, kingdoms and states; he is King of kings, and Lord of lords; the kingdoms of this world are his, and he is the Governor among the nations; they are all behind and under him, and disposed of by him at his pleasure; and he can restrain them, when he thinks fit, from doing any harm to his people: he is superior to all men, even the best and greatest; he is the Head of the church, and King of saints; and it is their business, and even their honour and privilege, to follow him whithersoever he goes: and he is superior to angels, has a more excellent name and nature than they, is the Creator and Maker of them, and is worshipped by them; and even, as Mediator, is in a greater office, and in a higher place, at the right hand of God, than they are; they are at his beck and command, and at hand to be sent forth on all occasions to do his business, to minister for him, and to his people; they are his servants, and devoted to his service, and are ready to do his pleasure. <p>(m) "hac nocte", Drusius.

The visions were seen in this one night at short intervals. There is nothing to make one suppose that they came in dreams (<a href="/isaiah/29-7.htm">Isaiah 29:7</a>). The prophet is awake, but whether he sees these scenes with his bodily eyes, or was rapt in ecstasy, cannot be decided. <span class="cmt_word">A man riding upon a red horse.</span> This is the Angel of Jehovah, mentioned again in ver. 10 and in ver. 11, in both of which places the description, "that stood among the myrtle trees," serves to identify him. He is different from the interpreting angel, and is the leader of the company of horsemen that follow him. Keil and Wright consider that the rider on the red horse cannot be identified with the Angel of Jehovah, because otherwise he would have been represented as standing opposite to the other horsemen to receive the information which they brought him, and they would not have been spoken of as "behind" hint. But the expression in ver. 8 may mean merely that the prophet sets his eyes first on the leader and then on the attendants. Or in ver. 10 he is the spokesman who begins the account of the riders' doings, which these themselves complete in ver. 11. Thus there are in the scene only <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the prophet; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the angel rider and his attendants; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the interpreting angel. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The red colour of the horse is supposed to represent war and bloodshed, as in <a href="/revelation/6-4.htm">Revelation 6:4</a>; but this seems unsuitable in this piece, where nothing of the kind is intimated, but rather the contrary (ver. 11). It is, indeed, impossible to affix any satisfactory explanation to the colour. If, as we may well suppose, this personage is the Angel of the covenant, who was the leader and guide of the Israelites (comp. <a href="/joshua/5-13.htm">Joshua 5:13</a>), his standing in the valley among the myrtles may represent the depressed and humbled condition of the chosen people, which yet was well pleasing unto God, like the sweet scent of odoriferous myrtles is agreeable to men. <span class="cmt_word">The myrtle trees.</span> The myrtle is indigenous in the hilly regions of Northern Palestine, and is still seen in the glens near Jerusalem, though no longer on the Mount of Olives, where the returned captives found it when celebrating their first Feast of Tabernacles (<a href="/nehemiah/8-15.htm">Nehemiah 8:15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In the bottom;</span> <span class="accented">the valley.</span> Myrtles love such places. "Amantes littora myrtos" (Virgil, 'Georg.,' 4:124). The term would suit the valley of the Kidron. Others render, "the shady place," or "the tabernacle," but not so appropriately.

The word occurs elsewhere only in <a href="/isaiah/16-8.htm">Isaiah 16:8</a>, where it is applied to the tendrils of the vitae. What is intended by the different colours of the horses is a matter of great dispute, and cannot be known. There is some reason for considering that they represent the world powers at this particular period - the Babylonian, the Medo-Persian, the Greek; three of those concerning which Daniel prophesied; the fourth, the Roman, not having yet come in view. The notion of tutelary angels, presiding over countries, was familiar to the Hebrew mind (see <a href="/daniel/10-12.htm">Daniel 10:12, 13, 20, 21</a>). These horsemen are evidently not post couriers, but warriors on military service. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/habakkuk/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Announcement of this work. - <a href="/habakkuk/1-6.htm">Habakkuk 1:6</a>.

The modern hypothesis, that the Chaldaeans were first of all transplanted by the Assyrians from the northern border mountains of Armenia, Media, and Assyria to Babylonia, and that having settled there, they afterwards grew into a cultivated people, and as a conquering nation exerted great influence in the history of the world, simply rests upon a most precarious interpretation of an obscure passage in Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/23-18.htm">Isaiah 23:18</a>), and has no higher value than the opinion of the latest Assyriologists that the Chaldaeans are a people of Tatar origin, who mingled with the Shemites of the countries bordering upon the Euphrates and Tigris (see Delitzsch on <a href="/isaiah/23-13.htm">Isaiah 23:13</a>). Habakkuk describes this people as mar, bitter, or rough, and, when used to denote a disposition, fierce (mar nephesh, <a href="/judges/18-25.htm">Judges 18:25</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/17-8.htm">2 Samuel 17:8</a>); and nimha&#770;r, heedless or rash (<a href="/isaiah/32-4.htm">Isaiah 32:4</a>), here violent, and as moving along the breadths of the earth (&#x3b5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2;, lxx: cf. <a href="/revelation/20-9.htm">Revelation 20:9</a>), i.e., marching through the whole extent of the earth (<a href="/isaiah/8-8.htm">Isaiah 8:8</a>): terram quam late patet (Ros.). &#1500; is not used here to denote the direction or the goal, but the space, as in <a href="/genesis/13-17.htm">Genesis 13:17</a> (Hitzig, Delitzsch).

In <a href="/habakkuk/1-7.htm">Habakkuk 1:7</a> the fierce disposition of this people is still further depicted, and in <a href="/habakkuk/1-8.htm">Habakkuk 1:8</a> the violence with which it advances. &#1488;&#1497;&#1501;, formidabilis, exciting terror; &#1504;&#1493;&#1512;&#1488;, metuendus, creating alarm. &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;, from it, not from God (cf. <a href="/psalms/17-2.htm">Psalm 17:2</a>), does its right proceed, i.e., it determines right, and the rule of its conduct, according to its own standard; and &#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1514;&#1493;, its eminence (<a href="/genesis/49-3.htm">Genesis 49:3</a>; <a href="/hosea/13-1.htm">Hosea 13:1</a>), "its &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b1; (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-7.htm">1 Corinthians 11:7</a>) above all other nations" (Hitzig), making itself lord through the might of its arms. Its horses are lighter, i.e., swifter of foot, than panthers, which spring with the greatest rapidity upon their prey (for proofs of the swiftness of the panther, see Bochart, Hieroz. ii. p. 104, ed. Ros.), and &#1495;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, lit., sharper, i.e., shooting sharply upon it. As qa&#770;lal represents swiftness as a light rapid movement, which hardly touches the ground, so cha&#770;da, &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, describes it as a hasty precipitate dash upon a certain object (Delitzsch). The first clause of this verse has been repeated by Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/4-13.htm">Jeremiah 4:13</a>), with the alteration of one letter (viz., &#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; for &#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;). Wolves of the evening (cf. <a href="/zephaniah/3-3.htm">Zephaniah 3:3</a>) are wolves which go out in the evening in search of prey, after having fasted through the day, not "wolves of Arabia (&#1506;&#1512;&#1489;  equals  &#1506;&#1512;&#1489;, lxx) or of the desert" (&#1506;&#1512;&#1489;&#1492; Kimchi).<p>Pa&#770;shu&#772; from pu&#772;sh, after the Arabic fa&#770;s&#780;, med.

The connection between this and pu&#772;sh (<a href="/nahum/3-18.htm">Nahum 3:18</a>), niphal to disperse or scatter one's self, is questionable. Delitzsch (on <a href="/job/35-15.htm">Job 35:15</a>) derives pu&#772;sh in this verse and the passage cited from Arab. fa&#770;s&#780;, med. Vav, in the sense of swimming upon the top, and apparently traces pu&#772;sh in <a href="//biblehub.com/nahum/3.htm">Nahum 3</a>, as well as pash in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/35-15.htm">Job 35:15</a>, to Arab. fs&#780;s&#780; (when used of water: to overflow its dam); whilst Freytag (in the Lexicon) gives, as the meaning of Arab. fs&#780;s&#780; II, dissolvit, dissipavit. Pa&#770;ra&#770;sh&#305;&#772;m are horsemen, not riding-horses. The repetition of &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1493; does not warrant our erasing the words &#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468; &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1493; as a gloss, as Hitzig proposes. It can be explained very simply from the fact, that in the second hemistich Habakkuk passes from the general description of the Chaldaeans to a picture of their invasion of Judah.  &#1502;&#1512;&#1495;&#1493;&#1511; , from afar, i.e., from Babylonia (cf. <a href="/isaiah/39-3.htm">Isaiah 39:3</a>). Their coming from afar, and the comparison of the rushing along of the Chaldaean horsemen to the flight of an eagle, points to the threat in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-49.htm">Deuteronomy 28:49</a>, "Jehovah shall bring against thee a nation from far, from the end of the earth, as swift as the eagle flieth," which is now about to be fulfilled. Jeremiah frequently uses the same comparison when speaking of the Chaldaeans, viz., in <a href="/jeremiah/4-13.htm">Jeremiah 4:13</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/48-40.htm">Jeremiah 48:40</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-22.htm">Jeremiah 49:22</a>, and <a href="/lamentations/4-19.htm">Lamentations 4:19</a> (cf. <a href="/2_samuel/1-23.htm">2 Samuel 1:23</a>). The &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. &#1502;&#1490;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; may mean a horde or crowd, after the Hebrew &#1490;&#1501; werbeH , and the Arabic jammah, or snorting, endeavouring, striving, after Arab. jmm and ja&#770;m, appetivit, in which case &#1490;&#1502;&#1501; would be connected with &#1490;&#1502;&#1488;, to swallow. But the first meaning does not suit &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; &#1511;&#1491;&#1497;&#1502;&#1492;, whereas the second does. &#1511;&#1491;&#1497;&#1502;&#1492;, not eastwards, but according to the primary meaning of &#1511;&#1491;&#1501;, to the front, forwards. Ewald renders it incorrectly: "the striving of their face is to storm, i.e., to mischief;" for qa&#770;d&#305;&#772;m, the east wind, when used in the sense of storm, is a figurative expression for that which is vain and worthless (<a href="/hosea/12-2.htm">Hosea 12:2</a>; cf. <a href="/job/15-2.htm">Job 15:2</a>), but not for mischief. For &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1505;&#1507;, compare <a href="/genesis/41-49.htm">Genesis 41:49</a> and <a href="/zechariah/9-3.htm">Zechariah 9:3</a>; and for &#1499;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1500;, like sand of the sea, <a href="/hosea/2-1.htm">Hosea 2:1</a>. In <a href="/habakkuk/1-10.htm">Habakkuk 1:10</a> &#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; and &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; are introduced, that the words &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1499;&#1497;&#1501; and &#1500;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1502;&#1489;&#1510;&#1512;, upon which the emphasis lies, may be placed first. It, the Chaldaean nation, scoffs at kings and princes, and every stronghold, i.e., it ridicules all the resistance that kings and princes offer to its advance, by putting forth their strength, as a perfectly fruitless attempt. Mischa&#770;q, the object of laughter. The words, it heaps up dust and takes it (the fortress), express the facility with which every fortress is conquered by it. To heap up dust: denoting the casting up an embankment for attack (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-15.htm">2 Samuel 20:15</a>, etc.). The feminine suffix attached to &#1497;&#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1491;&#1492;&#1468; refers ad sensum to the idea of a city (&#1506;&#1497;&#1512;), implied in &#1502;&#1489;&#1510;&#1512;, the latter being equivalent to &#1506;&#1497;&#1512; &#1502;&#1489;&#1510;&#1512; in <a href="/1_samuel/6-18.htm">1 Samuel 6:18</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/3-19.htm">2 Kings 3:19</a>, etc. Thus will the Chaldaean continue incessantly to overthrow kings and conquer kingdoms with tempestuous rapidity, till he offends, by deifying his own power. With this gentle hint at the termination of his tyranny, the announcement of the judgment closes in <a href="/habakkuk/1-11.htm">Habakkuk 1:11</a>. &#1488;&#1494;, there, i.e., in this appearance of his, as depicted in <a href="//biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-6.htm">Habakkuk 1:6-10</a> : not "then," in which case <a href="/habakkuk/1-11.htm">Habakkuk 1:11</a> would affirm to what further enterprises the Chaldaeans would proceed after their rapidly and easily effected conquests. The perfects &#1495;&#1500;&#1507; and &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1489;&#1493;&#1512; are used prophetically, representing the future as occurring already. &#1495;&#1500;&#1507; and &#1506;&#1489;&#1512; are used synonymously: to pass along and go further, used of the wind or tempest, as in <a href="/isaiah/21-1.htm">Isaiah 21:1</a>; here, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/8-8.htm">Isaiah 8:8</a>, of the hostile army overflowing the land; with this difference, however, that in Isaiah it is thought of as a stream of water, whereas here it is thought of as a tempest sweeping over the land. The subject to cha&#770;laph is not ru&#772;a&#774;ch, but the Chaldaean (&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;, <a href="/habakkuk/1-10.htm">Habakkuk 1:10</a>); and ru&#772;a&#774;ch is used appositionally, to denote the manner in which it passes along, viz., "like a tempestuous wind" (ru&#772;a&#774;ch as in <a href="/job/30-15.htm">Job 30:15</a>; <a href="/isaiah/7-2.htm">Isaiah 7:2</a>). &#1493;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501; is not a participle, but a perfect with Vav rel., expressing the consequence, "and so he offends." In what way is stated in the last clause, in which &#1494;&#1493;&#1468; does not answer to the relative &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, in the sense of "he whose power," but is placed demonstratively before the noun &#1499;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;, like &#1494;&#1492; in <a href="/exodus/32-1.htm">Exodus 32:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/9-12.htm">Joshua 9:12-13</a>, and <a href="/isaiah/23-13.htm">Isaiah 23:13</a> (cf. Ewald, 293, b), pointing back to the strength of the Chaldaean, which has been previously depicted in its intensive and extensive greatness (Delitzsch). This its power is god to it, i.e., it makes it into its god (for the thought, compare <a href="//biblehub.com/job/12-6.htm">Job 12:6</a>, and the words of the Assyrian in <a href="/isaiah/10-13.htm">Isaiah 10:13</a>). The ordinary explanation of the first hemistich is, on the other hand, untenable (then its courage becomes young again, or grows), since &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; cannot stand for &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;, and &#1506;&#1489;&#1512; without an object given in the context cannot mean to overstep, i.e., to go beyond the proper measure. </body></html>
