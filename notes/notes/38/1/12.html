<span class="ital">and on the cities of Judah — </span>These still lay wholly in ruins; <span class="ital">against which thou hast had indignation these threescore and ten years — </span>There are three ways of computing the seventy years of the captivity, taken notice of in Scripture. The first is, beginning from the fourth year of Jehoiakim to the first of Cyrus: this is Jeremiah’s account, <a href="/jeremiah/25-1.htm" title="The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, that was the first year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon;">Jeremiah 25:1</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/25-11.htm" title="And this whole land shall be a desolation, and an astonishment; and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years.">Jeremiah 25:11</a>; which Daniel follows, <a href="/daniel/9-2.htm" title="In the first year of his reign I Daniel understood by books the number of the years, whereof the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the prophet, that he would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of Jerusalem.">Daniel 9:2</a>. Another may be computed from the besieging of Jerusalem in the ninth year of Zedekiah, in the tenth month, for which a solemn fast was kept by the Jews: compare <a href="/2_kings/25-1.htm" title="And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he, and all his host, against Jerusalem, and pitched against it; and they built forts against it round about.">2 Kings 25:1</a>, with <a href="/zechariah/8-19.htm" title="Thus said the LORD of hosts; The fast of the fourth month, and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth, shall be to the house of Judah joy and gladness, and cheerful feasts; therefore love the truth and peace.">Zechariah 8:19</a>. This computation ends with the second year of Darius, which is the reckoning Zechariah here follows. Or lastly, if we compute the beginning of the seventy years from the destruction of Jerusalem and the first temple, which came to pass in the eleventh year of the same reign, they will be accomplished in the fourth year of Darius, and this computation agrees with what is said <a href="/zechariah/7-1.htm" title="And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Darius, that the word of the LORD came to Zechariah in the fourth day of the ninth month, even in Chisleu;">Zechariah 7:1</a>; <a href="/zechariah/7-5.htm" title="Speak to all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying, When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh month, even those seventy years, did you at all fast to me, even to me?">Zechariah 7:5</a>. The last two ways of reckoning the seventy years may be reduced to one, only by supposing, that the prophet, in this verse, sets down a complete for an incomplete number, and calls that space of time seventy years, which wanted but little of it: a way of speaking of which several instances may be produced.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/zechariah/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:7-17 The prophet saw a dark, shady grove, hidden by hills. This represented the low, melancholy condition of the Jewish church. A man like a warrior sat on a red horse, in the midst of this shady myrtle-grove. Though the church was in a low condition, Christ was present in the midst, ready to appear for the relief of his people. Behind him were angels ready to be employed by him, some in acts of judgment, others of mercy, others in mixed events. Would we know something of the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, we must apply, not to angels, for they are themselves learners, but to Christ himself. He is ready to teach those humbly desirous to learn the things of God. The nations near Judea enjoyed peace at that time, but the state of the Jews was unsettled, which gave rise to the pleading that followed; but mercy must only be hoped for through Christ. His intercession for his church prevails. The Lord answered the Angel, this Angel of the covenant, with promises of mercy and deliverance. All the good words and comfortable words of the gospel we receive from Jesus Christ, as he received them from the Father, in answer to the prayer of his blood; and his ministers are to preach them to all the world. The earth sat still, and was at rest. It is not uncommon for the enemies of God to be at rest in sin, while his people are enduring correction, harassed by temptation, disquieted by fears of wrath, or groaning under oppression and persecution. Here are predictions which had reference to the revival of the Jews after the captivity, but those events were shadows of what shall take place in the church, after the oppression of the New Testament Babylon is ended.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/zechariah/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the Angel of the Lord answered - the implied longing, by intercession with God. As the angel-interpreter in Job had  "the office of no mere created angel, but one, anticipative of His, who came at once to redeem and justify," so the Angel of the Lord, in whom God was, exercised at once a mediatorial office with God, typical of our Lord's high priest's prayer <a href="//biblehub.com/john/17.htm">John 17</a>, and acted as God.<p>These seventy years - The seventy years of the captivity, prophesied by Jeremiah Jer 25:11-12; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10</a>, were on the eve of their conclusion at the time of Daniel's great prayer of intercession <a href="/daniel/9-2.htm">Daniel 9:2</a>; they ended with the capture of Babylon, and the edict of Cyrus, permitting the Jews to return <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-22.htm">2 Chronicles 36:22-23</a>; <a href="/ezra/1-1.htm">Ezra 1:1</a>. Yet there seems to have been a secondary fulfillment, from the destruction of the temple and city, in Zedekiah's eleventh year <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/25-2.htm">2 Kings 25:2</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/25-8.htm">2 Kings 25:8-9</a>, 588 b.c. to the second year of Darius, 519 b.c. Such double fulfillments of prophecy are not like alternative fulfillments. They are a more intricate and fuller, not an easier fulfillment of it. Yet "these 70 years" do not necessitate such a double fulfillment. It might express only a reverent wonder, that the 70 years being accomplished, the complete restoration was not yet brought to pass. Cyril: "God having fixed the time of the captivity to the 70th year, it was necessary to be silent, so long as the time was not yet come to an end, that he might not seem to oppose the Lord's will. But, when the time was now come to a close and the fear of offending was removed, he, knowing that the Lord cannot lie, entreats and ventures to enquire whether His anger has come to an end, as had those who sinned; or whether, fresh sins having accrued, there shall be a further delay, and their forlorn estate shall be yet further extended. They then who worship God have a good and not uncertain hope, that, if they should offend from infirmity, yet have they those who should entreat for them, not people only, but the holy angels themselves, who render God gracious and propitious, soothing His anger by their purity, and in a manner winning the grieved judge. Then the Angel entreated for the synagogue to the Jews; but we, who believe and have been sanctified in the Spirit <a href="//biblehub.com/1_john/2-1.htm">1 John 2:1-2</a>, "have an Advocate with the Father Jesus Christ the righteous, and He is the propitiation for our sins," and as the inspired Paul writes, "God hath set Him forth as a propitiation through faith, freeing from sin those who come to Him" <a href="/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/zechariah/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. Not only does Messiah stand among His people (the "myrtles," Zec 1:8), but intercedes for them with the Father ("Lord," or "Jehovah of hosts") effectively (Zec 1:13; Heb 7:25). Compare Ps 102:13-20; Isa 62:6, 7, as to Judah's restoration in answer to prayer.<p>answered and said&#8212;said in continuation of the discourse: proceeded to say.<p>how long&#8212;Messiah's people pray similarly to their Head. Re 6:10, "How long," &c. Heretofore it was vain to pray, but now that the divinely appointed "threescore and ten years" (Jer 25:11; 29:10) are elapsed, it is time to pray to Thee for the fulfilment of Thy promise, seeing that Thy grace is not yet fully manifested, nor Thy promise fulfilled. God's promises are not to make us slothful, but to quicken our prayers. Henderson, dating the seventy years from the destruction of Jerusalem (588 B.C.), supposes two years of the seventy had yet to run (520 B.C.).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/zechariah/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Then, </span> when the surveying angels had made their report of the prosperity of the heathen, the angel of the Lord, the Angel, the Lord Christ, Mediator of the church, and Head of the church, answered and said; prays as one interceding. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">O Lord of hosts:</span> Christ speaks to his Father, speaks as one much affected with the state of his afflicted church. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">How long wilt thou not have mercy?</span> it is the expostulation that well befits a praying soul; it is not the inquiry of a discontented mind, but the request of one longing for mercy.

Abram migrated to Canaan from Ur of the Chaldees, from the other side of the river (Euphrates: <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/11-28.htm">Genesis 11:28</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/11-31.htm">Genesis 11:31</a>, compared with <a href="/joshua/24-2.htm">Joshua 24:2</a>); and the Kasd&#305;&#772;m in Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel are inhabitants of Babel or Babylonia (<a href="/isaiah/43-14.htm">Isaiah 43:14</a>; <a href="/isaiah/47-1.htm">Isaiah 47:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/48-14.htm">Isaiah 48:14</a>, <a href="/isaiah/48-20.htm">Isaiah 48:20</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/21-9.htm">Jeremiah 21:9</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-4.htm">Jeremiah 32:4</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-24.htm">Jeremiah 32:24</a>, etc.; <a href="/ezekiel/23-23.htm">Ezekiel 23:23</a>). Babylonia is called 'erets Kasd&#305;&#772;m (<a href="/jeremiah/24-5.htm">Jeremiah 24:5</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/25-12.htm">Jeremiah 25:12</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/12-13.htm">Ezekiel 12:13</a>), or simply Kasd&#305;&#772;m (<a href="/jeremiah/50-10.htm">Jeremiah 50:10</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-24.htm">Jeremiah 51:24</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/51-35.htm">Jeremiah 51:35</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/26-29.htm">Ezekiel 26:29</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/23-16.htm">Ezekiel 23:16</a>). The modern hypothesis, that the Chaldaeans were first of all transplanted by the Assyrians from the northern border mountains of Armenia, Media, and Assyria to Babylonia, and that having settled there, they afterwards grew into a cultivated people, and as a conquering nation exerted great influence in the history of the world, simply rests upon a most precarious interpretation of an obscure passage in Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/23-18.htm">Isaiah 23:18</a>), and has no higher value than the opinion of the latest Assyriologists that the Chaldaeans are a people of Tatar origin, who mingled with the Shemites of the countries bordering upon the Euphrates and Tigris (see Delitzsch on <a href="/isaiah/23-13.htm">Isaiah 23:13</a>). Habakkuk describes this people as mar, bitter, or rough, and, when used to denote a disposition, fierce (mar nephesh, <a href="/judges/18-25.htm">Judges 18:25</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/17-8.htm">2 Samuel 17:8</a>); and nimha&#770;r, heedless or rash (<a href="/isaiah/32-4.htm">Isaiah 32:4</a>), here violent, and as moving along the breadths of the earth (&#x3b5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2;, lxx: cf. <a href="/revelation/20-9.htm">Revelation 20:9</a>), i.e., marching through the whole extent of the earth (<a href="/isaiah/8-8.htm">Isaiah 8:8</a>): terram quam late patet (Ros.). &#1500; is not used here to denote the direction or the goal, but the space, as in <a href="/genesis/13-17.htm">Genesis 13:17</a> (Hitzig, Delitzsch). To take possession of dwelling-laces that are not his own (&#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1500;&#1493;  equals  &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1500;&#1493;), i.e., to take possession of foreign lands that do not belong to him. In <a href="/habakkuk/1-7.htm">Habakkuk 1:7</a> the fierce disposition of this people is still further depicted, and in <a href="/habakkuk/1-8.htm">Habakkuk 1:8</a> the violence with which it advances. &#1488;&#1497;&#1501;, formidabilis, exciting terror; &#1504;&#1493;&#1512;&#1488;, metuendus, creating alarm. &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;, from it, not from God (cf. <a href="/psalms/17-2.htm">Psalm 17:2</a>), does its right proceed, i.e., it determines right, and the rule of its conduct, according to its own standard; and &#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1514;&#1493;, its eminence (<a href="/genesis/49-3.htm">Genesis 49:3</a>; <a href="/hosea/13-1.htm">Hosea 13:1</a>), "its &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b1; (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-7.htm">1 Corinthians 11:7</a>) above all other nations" (Hitzig), making itself lord through the might of its arms. Its horses are lighter, i.e., swifter of foot, than panthers, which spring with the greatest rapidity upon their prey (for proofs of the swiftness of the panther, see Bochart, Hieroz. ii. p. 104, ed. Ros.), and &#1495;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, lit., sharper, i.e., shooting sharply upon it. As qa&#770;lal represents swiftness as a light rapid movement, which hardly touches the ground, so cha&#770;da, &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, describes it as a hasty precipitate dash upon a certain object (Delitzsch). The first clause of this verse has been repeated by Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/4-13.htm">Jeremiah 4:13</a>), with the alteration of one letter (viz., &#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; for &#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;). Wolves of the evening (cf. <a href="/zephaniah/3-3.htm">Zephaniah 3:3</a>) are wolves which go out in the evening in search of prey, after having fasted through the day, not "wolves of Arabia (&#1506;&#1512;&#1489;  equals  &#1506;&#1512;&#1489;, lxx) or of the desert" (&#1506;&#1512;&#1489;&#1492; Kimchi).<p>Pa&#770;shu&#772; from pu&#772;sh, after the Arabic fa&#770;s&#780;, med. Ye, to strut proudly; when used of a horse and its rider, to spring along, to gallop; or of a calf, to hop or jump (<a href="/jeremiah/50-11.htm">Jeremiah 50:11</a>; <a href="/malachi/4-2.htm">Malachi 4:2</a>). The connection between this and pu&#772;sh (<a href="/nahum/3-18.htm">Nahum 3:18</a>), niphal to disperse or scatter one's self, is questionable. Delitzsch (on <a href="/job/35-15.htm">Job 35:15</a>) derives pu&#772;sh in this verse and the passage cited from Arab. fa&#770;s&#780;, med. Vav, in the sense of swimming upon the top, and apparently traces pu&#772;sh in <a href="//biblehub.com/nahum/3.htm">Nahum 3</a>, as well as pash in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/35-15.htm">Job 35:15</a>, to Arab. fs&#780;s&#780; (when used of water: to overflow its dam); whilst Freytag (in the Lexicon) gives, as the meaning of Arab. fs&#780;s&#780; II, dissolvit, dissipavit. Pa&#770;ra&#770;sh&#305;&#772;m are horsemen, not riding-horses. The repetition of &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1493; does not warrant our erasing the words &#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468; &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1493; as a gloss, as Hitzig proposes. It can be explained very simply from the fact, that in the second hemistich Habakkuk passes from the general description of the Chaldaeans to a picture of their invasion of Judah.  &#1502;&#1512;&#1495;&#1493;&#1511; , from afar, i.e., from Babylonia (cf. <a href="/isaiah/39-3.htm">Isaiah 39:3</a>). Their coming from afar, and the comparison of the rushing along of the Chaldaean horsemen to the flight of an eagle, points to the threat in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-49.htm">Deuteronomy 28:49</a>, "Jehovah shall bring against thee a nation from far, from the end of the earth, as swift as the eagle flieth," which is now about to be fulfilled. Jeremiah frequently uses the same comparison when speaking of the Chaldaeans, viz., in <a href="/jeremiah/4-13.htm">Jeremiah 4:13</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/48-40.htm">Jeremiah 48:40</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-22.htm">Jeremiah 49:22</a>, and <a href="/lamentations/4-19.htm">Lamentations 4:19</a> (cf. <a href="/2_samuel/1-23.htm">2 Samuel 1:23</a>). The &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. &#1502;&#1490;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; may mean a horde or crowd, after the Hebrew &#1490;&#1501; werbeH , and the Arabic jammah, or snorting, endeavouring, striving, after Arab. jmm and ja&#770;m, appetivit, in which case &#1490;&#1502;&#1501; would be connected with &#1490;&#1502;&#1488;, to swallow. But the first meaning does not suit &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; &#1511;&#1491;&#1497;&#1502;&#1492;, whereas the second does. &#1511;&#1491;&#1497;&#1502;&#1492;, not eastwards, but according to the primary meaning of &#1511;&#1491;&#1501;, to the front, forwards. Ewald renders it incorrectly: "the striving of their face is to storm, i.e., to mischief;" for qa&#770;d&#305;&#772;m, the east wind, when used in the sense of storm, is a figurative expression for that which is vain and worthless (<a href="/hosea/12-2.htm">Hosea 12:2</a>; cf. <a href="/job/15-2.htm">Job 15:2</a>), but not for mischief. For &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1505;&#1507;, compare <a href="/genesis/41-49.htm">Genesis 41:49</a> and <a href="/zechariah/9-3.htm">Zechariah 9:3</a>; and for &#1499;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1500;, like sand of the sea, <a href="/hosea/2-1.htm">Hosea 2:1</a>. In <a href="/habakkuk/1-10.htm">Habakkuk 1:10</a> &#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; and &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; are introduced, that the words &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1499;&#1497;&#1501; and &#1500;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1502;&#1489;&#1510;&#1512;, upon which the emphasis lies, may be placed first. It, the Chaldaean nation, scoffs at kings and princes, and every stronghold, i.e., it ridicules all the resistance that kings and princes offer to its advance, by putting forth their strength, as a perfectly fruitless attempt. Mischa&#770;q, the object of laughter. The words, it heaps up dust and takes it (the fortress), express the facility with which every fortress is conquered by it. To heap up dust: denoting the casting up an embankment for attack (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-15.htm">2 Samuel 20:15</a>, etc.). The feminine suffix attached to &#1497;&#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1491;&#1492;&#1468; refers ad sensum to the idea of a city (&#1506;&#1497;&#1512;), implied in &#1502;&#1489;&#1510;&#1512;, the latter being equivalent to &#1506;&#1497;&#1512; &#1502;&#1489;&#1510;&#1512; in <a href="/1_samuel/6-18.htm">1 Samuel 6:18</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/3-19.htm">2 Kings 3:19</a>, etc. Thus will the Chaldaean continue incessantly to overthrow kings and conquer kingdoms with tempestuous rapidity, till he offends, by deifying his own power. With this gentle hint at the termination of his tyranny, the announcement of the judgment closes in <a href="/habakkuk/1-11.htm">Habakkuk 1:11</a>. &#1488;&#1494;, there, i.e., in this appearance of his, as depicted in <a href="//biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-6.htm">Habakkuk 1:6-10</a> : not "then," in which case <a href="/habakkuk/1-11.htm">Habakkuk 1:11</a> would affirm to what further enterprises the Chaldaeans would proceed after their rapidly and easily effected conquests. The perfects &#1495;&#1500;&#1507; and &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1489;&#1493;&#1512; are used prophetically, representing the future as occurring already. &#1495;&#1500;&#1507; and &#1506;&#1489;&#1512; are used synonymously: to pass along and go further, used of the wind or tempest, as in <a href="/isaiah/21-1.htm">Isaiah 21:1</a>; here, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/8-8.htm">Isaiah 8:8</a>, of the hostile army overflowing the land; with this difference, however, that in Isaiah it is thought of as a stream of water, whereas here it is thought of as a tempest sweeping over the land. The subject to cha&#770;laph is not ru&#772;a&#774;ch, but the Chaldaean (&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;, <a href="/habakkuk/1-10.htm">Habakkuk 1:10</a>); and ru&#772;a&#774;ch is used appositionally, to denote the manner in which it passes along, viz., "like a tempestuous wind" (ru&#772;a&#774;ch as in <a href="/job/30-15.htm">Job 30:15</a>; <a href="/isaiah/7-2.htm">Isaiah 7:2</a>). &#1493;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501; is not a participle, but a perfect with Vav rel., expressing the consequence, "and so he offends." In what way is stated in the last clause, in which &#1494;&#1493;&#1468; does not answer to the relative &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, in the sense of "he whose power," but is placed demonstratively before the noun &#1499;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;, like &#1494;&#1492; in <a href="/exodus/32-1.htm">Exodus 32:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/9-12.htm">Joshua 9:12-13</a>, and <a href="/isaiah/23-13.htm">Isaiah 23:13</a> (cf. Ewald, 293, b), pointing back to the strength of the Chaldaean, which has been previously depicted in its intensive and extensive greatness (Delitzsch). This its power is god to it, i.e., it makes it into its god (for the thought, compare <a href="//biblehub.com/job/12-6.htm">Job 12:6</a>, and the words of the Assyrian in <a href="/isaiah/10-13.htm">Isaiah 10:13</a>). The ordinary explanation of the first hemistich is, on the other hand, untenable (then its courage becomes young again, or grows), since &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; cannot stand for &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;, and &#1506;&#1489;&#1512; without an object given in the context cannot mean to overstep, i.e., to go beyond the proper measure. </body></html>
