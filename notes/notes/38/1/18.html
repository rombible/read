The horns here mentioned denote the powers which had scattered Israel and Judah, or that should scatter them, as a bull, in his fury, tosses into the air whatever opposes him. It is uncertain whether the number <span class="ital">four </span>is here used indefinitely, or to denote that specific number; and if the latter, what particular powers are pointed out by it. Calmet supposes the Assyrians, Chaldeans, Persians, and Egyptians. But “the most ancient and prevailing opinion among the Jews themselves, and perhaps the most probable of any, is, that the four great empires, the Assyrian, or Babylonian, the Persian, Grecian, and Roman, are intended; namely, the empires alluded to by the four beasts, Daniel 7. By each of these the Jewish nation hath been in turns oppressed, and all of them have been successively brought down and annihilated; although, from the depression of the last, the Jews have not as yet apparently derived any considerable advantage.” — Blayney. <span class="ital">The Lord showed me four carpenters</span> — Or <span class="ital">workmen, </span>as Bishop Newcome renders the word, observing, “Vitringa supposes that the horns were iron, and that these were fabri ferrarii malleis dolabris que intructi,” blacksmiths furnished with hammers and axes. <span class="ital">Then said I, What come these to do? — </span>He inquires not who or what they were, but what was their business and design. <span class="ital">And he spake, </span>(or said,) <span class="ital">These are the horns — </span>In order to satisfy the inquiry of the prophet, the angel first points to the four horns, mentioned <a href="/context/zechariah/1-18.htm" title="Then lifted I up my eyes, and saw, and behold four horns....">Zechariah 1:18-19</a>, as if he had said, See, there are four horns, <span class="ital">which have scattered Judah. </span>The LXX. add, <span class="greekheb">και την Ισραηλ κατεαξαν</span>, <span class="ital">and have broken Israel. </span>Instead of which addition the Arabic has, <span class="ital">and destroyed Jerusalem.

Observe, reader, in what way soever the church is threatened with mischief, and whatever opposition is given to its interests, God can find out ways and means to check the force, or restrain the wrath of its enemies, and make it turn to his praise. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/zechariah/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:18-21 The enemies of the church threaten to cut off the name of Israel. They are horns, emblems of power, strength, and violence. The prophet saw them so formidable that he began to despair of the safety of every good man, and the success of every good work; but the Lord showed him four workmen empowered to cut off these horns. With an eye of sense we see the power of the enemies of the church; look which way we will, the world shows us that; but it is only with an eye of faith that we see it safe. The Lord shows us that. When God has work to do, he will raise up some to do it, and others to defend it, and to protect those employed in doing it. What cause there is to look up in love and praise to the holy and eternal Spirit, who has the same care over the present and eternal interests of believers, by the holy word bringing the church to know the wonderful things of salvation!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/zechariah/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And I lifted up mine eyes - o. Cyril on <a href="/zechariah/2-1.htm">Zechariah 2:1</a> : "Not those of the body (for such visions are invisible to the eyes of the flesh), but rather the inner eyes of the heart and mind." It seems as though, at the close of each vision, Zechariah sank in meditation on what had been shown him; from which he was again roused by the exhibition of another vision.<p>I saw four horns - The mention of the horns naturally suggests the thought of the creatures which wielded them; as in the first vision that of the horses following the chiefs, implies the presence of the riders upon them. And this the more, since the word "fray them away" implies living creatures, liable to fear. Cyril: "The horn, in inspired Scripture, is always taken as an image of strength, and mostly of pride also, as David said to some, "I said unto the fools, Deal not so foolishly, and to the ungodly, Lift not up the horns. Lift not up your horns on high and speak not with a stiff neck" <a href="/psalms/75-4.htm">Psalm 75:4</a>.

Second Vision. The power of the Jews foes shall be dissipated.<p>18. four horns&#8212;To a pastoral people like the Jews the horns of the strongest in the herd naturally suggested a symbol of power and pride of conscious strength: hence the ruling powers of the world (Re 17:3, 12). The number four in Zechariah's time referred to the four cardinal points of the horizon. Wherever God's people turned, there were foes to encounter (Ne 4:7); the Assyrian, Chaldean, and Samaritan on the north; Egypt and Arabia on the south; Philistia on the west; Ammon and Moab on the east. But the Spirit in the prophet looked farther; namely, to the four world powers, the only ones which were, or are, to rise till the kingdom of Messiah, the fifth, overthrows and absorbs all others in its universal dominion. Babylon and Medo-Persia alone had as yet risen, but soon Gr&aelig;co-Macedonia was to succeed (as Zec 9:13 foretells), and Rome the fourth and last, was to follow (Da 2:1-49; 7:1-28). The fact that the repairing of the evils caused to Judah and Israel by all four kingdoms is spoken of here, proves that the exhaustive fulfilment is yet future, and only the earnest of it given in the overthrow of the two world powers which up to Zechariah's time had "scattered" Judah (Jer 51:2; Eze 5:10, 12). That only two of the four had as yet risen, is an argument having no weight with us, as we believe God's Spirit in the prophets regards the future as present; we therefore are not to be led by Rationalists who on such grounds deny the reference here and in Zec 6:1 to the four world kingdoms.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/zechariah/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Then; </span> after I had seen those things, and heard those comfortable words, and received commission to publish all the good news I had heard. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I lifted up mine eyes:</span> he was so intent before, that he looked on nothing else; now he lifts up his eyes. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Saw; </span> clearly, certainly, and distinctly. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Behold four horns; </span> emblems of the enemies of the Jews, for strength, fierceness, and pride, and for their number, from all parts of the world. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/zechariah/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then I lifted up mine eyes,....

The prophet proceeds to lay this enigma before God in <a href="//biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-13.htm">Habakkuk 1:13-17</a>, and to pray for his people to be spared during the period of the Chaldaean affliction. <a href="/habakkuk/1-13.htm">Habakkuk 1:13</a>. "Art Thou too pure of eye to behold evil, and canst Thou not look upon distress? Wherefore lookest Thou upon the treacherous? and art silent when the wicked devours one more righteous than he? <a href="/habakkuk/1-14.htm">Habakkuk 1:14</a>. And Thou hast made men like fishes of the sea, like reptiles that have no ruler. <a href="/habakkuk/1-15.htm">Habakkuk 1:15</a>. All of them hath he lifted up with the hook; he draws them into his net, and gathers them in his fishing net; he rejoices thereat, and is glad. <a href="/habakkuk/1-16.htm">Habakkuk 1:16</a>. Therefore he sacrifices to his net, and burns incense to his landing net; for through them is his portion rich, and his food fat. <a href="/habakkuk/1-17.htm">Habakkuk 1:17</a>. Shall he therefore empty his net, and always strangle nations without sparing?" In <a href="//biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-13.htm">Habakkuk 1:13</a>, &#1496;&#1492;&#1493;&#1512; &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, with the two clauses dependent upon it, stands as a vocative, and &#1496;&#1492;&#1493;&#1512; followed by &#1502;&#1503; as a comparative: purer of eyes than to be able to see. This epithet is applied to God as the pure One, whose eyes cannot bear what is morally unclean, i.e., cannot look upon evil. The purity of God is not measured here by His seeing evil, but is described as exalted above it, and not coming at all into comparison with it. On the relation in which these words stand to <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/23-21.htm">Numbers 23:21</a>, see the remarks on <a href="/habakkuk/1-3.htm">Habakkuk 1:3</a>. In the second clause the infinitive construction passes over into the finite verb, as is frequently the case; so that &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; must be supplied in thought: who canst not look upon, i.e., canst not tolerate, the distress which the wicked man prepares for others. Wherefore then lookest Thou upon treacherous ones, namely, the Chaldaeans? They are called &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1490;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;, from their faithlessly deceptive and unscrupulously rapacious conduct, as in <a href="/isaiah/21-2.htm">Isaiah 21:2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/24-16.htm">Isaiah 24:16</a>. That the seeing is a quiet observance, without interposing to punish, is evident from the parallel &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;: Thou art silent at the swallowing of the &#1510;&#1491;&#1497;&#1511; &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;. The more righteous than he (the ungodly one) is not the nation of Israel as such, which, if not perfectly righteous, was relatively more righteous than the Chaldaeans. This rabbinical view is proved to be erroneous, by the fact that in <a href="/habakkuk/1-2.htm">Habakkuk 1:2</a> and <a href="/habakkuk/1-3.htm">Habakkuk 1:3</a> the prophet describes the moral depravity of Israel in the same words as those which he here applies to the conduct of the Chaldaeans. The persons intended are rather the godly portion of Israel, who have to share in the expiation of the sins of the ungodly, and suffer when they are punished (Delitzsch). This fact, that the righteous is swallowed along with the unrighteous, appears irreconcilable with the holiness of God, and suggests the inquiry, how God can possibly let this be done.<p>This strange fact is depicted still further in <a href="//biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-14.htm">Habakkuk 1:14-16</a> in figures taken from the life of a fisherman. The men are like fishes, whom the Chaldaean collects together in his net, and then pays divine honour to his net, by which he has been so enriched. &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; is not dependent upon &#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;, but continues the address in a simple picture, in which the imperfect with Vav convers. represents the act as the natural consequence of the silence of God: "and so Thou makest the men like fishes," etc. The point of comparison lies in the relative clause &#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500; &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;, "which has no ruler," which is indeed formally attached to &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1502;&#1513;&#1474; alone, but in actual fact belongs to &#1491;&#1468;&#1490;&#1497; &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1501; also. "No ruler," to take the defenceless under his protection, and shelter and defend them against enemies. Then will Judah be taken prisoner and swallowed up by the Chaldaeans. God has given it helplessly up to the power of its foes, and has obviously ceased to be its king. Compare the similar lamentation in <a href="/isaiah/63-19.htm">Isaiah 63:19</a> : "are even like those over whom Thou hast never ruled." &#1512;&#1502;&#1513;&#1474;, the creeping thing, the smaller animals which exist in great multitudes, and move with great swiftness, refers here to the smaller water animals, to which the word remes is also applied in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/104-25.htm">Psalm 104:25</a>, and the verb ra&#770;mas in <a href="/genesis/1-21.htm">Genesis 1:21</a> and <a href="/leviticus/11-46.htm">Leviticus 11:46</a>. &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;, pointing back to the collective 'a&#770;da&#770;m, is the object, and is written first for the sake of emphasis. The form &#1492;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492;, instead of &#1492;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492;, is analogous to the hophal &#1492;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492; in <a href="/nahum/2-8.htm">Nahum 2:8</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/6-28.htm">Judges 6:28</a>, and also to &#1492;&#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468; in <a href="/joshua/7-7.htm">Joshua 7:7</a> : to take up out of the water (see Ges. 63, Anm. 4). &#1497;&#1490;&#1512;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; from &#1490;&#1512;&#1512;, to pull, to draw together. Chakka&#770;h is the hook, cherem the net generally, mikhmereth the large fishing-net (&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;), the lower part of which, when sunk, touches the bottom, whilst the upper part floats on the top of the water. These figures are not to be interpreted with such specialty as that the net and fishing net answer to the sword and bow; but the hook, the net, and the fishing net, as the things used for catching fish, refer to all the means which the Chaldaeans employ in order to subdue and destroy the nations. Luther interprets it correctly. "These hooks, nets, and fishing nets," he says, "are nothing more than his great and powerful armies, by which he gained dominion over all lands and people, and brought home to Babylon the goods, jewels, silver, and gold, interest and rent of all the world." He rejoices over the success of his enterprises, over this capture of men, and sacrifices and burns incense to his net, i.e., he attributes to the means which he has employed the honour due to God. There is no allusion in these words to the custom of the Scythians and Sauromatians, who are said by Herodotus (iv. 59, 60) to have offered sacrifices every year to a sabre, which was set up as a symbol of Mars. What the Chaldaean made into his god, is expressed in <a href="//biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-11.htm">Habakkuk 1:11</a>, namely, his own power. "He who boasts of a thing, and is glad and joyous on account of it, but does not thank the true God, makes himself into an idol, gives himself the glory, and does not rejoice in God, but in his own strength and work" (Luther). The Chaldaean sacrifices to his net, for thereby (&#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;, by net and yarn) his portion (chelqo&#772;) is fat, i.e., the portion of this booty which falls to him, and fat is his food  ( &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492;  is a neuter substantive). The meaning is, that he thereby attains to wealth and prosperity. In <a href="/habakkuk/1-17.htm">Habakkuk 1:17</a> there is appended to this the question embracing the thought: Shall he therefore, because he rejoices over his rich booty, or offers sacrifice to his net, empty his net, sc. to throw it in afresh, and proceed continually to destroy nations in so unsparing a manner? In the last clause the figure passes over into a literal address. The place of the imperfect is now taken by a periphrastic construction with the infinitive: Shall he constantly be about to slay? On this construction, see Ges. 132, 3, Anm. 1, and Ewald, 237, c. &#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1495;&#1502;&#1493;&#1500; is a subordinate clause appended in an adverbial sense: unsparingly, without sparing. </body></html>
