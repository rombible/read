This represented the low, melancholy condition of the Jewish church. A man like a warrior sat on a red horse, in the midst of this shady myrtle-grove. Though the church was in a low condition, Christ was present in the midst, ready to appear for the relief of his people. Behind him were angels ready to be employed by him, some in acts of judgment, others of mercy, others in mixed events. Would we know something of the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, we must apply, not to angels, for they are themselves learners, but to Christ himself. He is ready to teach those humbly desirous to learn the things of God. The nations near Judea enjoyed peace at that time, but the state of the Jews was unsettled, which gave rise to the pleading that followed; but mercy must only be hoped for through Christ. His intercession for his church prevails. The Lord answered the Angel, this Angel of the covenant, with promises of mercy and deliverance. All the good words and comfortable words of the gospel we receive from Jesus Christ, as he received them from the Father, in answer to the prayer of his blood; and his ministers are to preach them to all the world. The earth sat still, and was at rest. It is not uncommon for the enemies of God to be at rest in sin, while his people are enduring correction, harassed by temptation, disquieted by fears of wrath, or groaning under oppression and persecution. Here are predictions which had reference to the revival of the Jews after the captivity, but those events were shadows of what shall take place in the church, after the oppression of the New Testament Babylon is ended.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/zechariah/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the Lord answered the angel that talked with me - Either directly, at the intercession of the angel of the Lord, or mediately through an answer first given to him, and by him communicated to the subordinate angel.

The modern hypothesis, that the Chaldaeans were first of all transplanted by the Assyrians from the northern border mountains of Armenia, Media, and Assyria to Babylonia, and that having settled there, they afterwards grew into a cultivated people, and as a conquering nation exerted great influence in the history of the world, simply rests upon a most precarious interpretation of an obscure passage in Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/23-18.htm">Isaiah 23:18</a>), and has no higher value than the opinion of the latest Assyriologists that the Chaldaeans are a people of Tatar origin, who mingled with the Shemites of the countries bordering upon the Euphrates and Tigris (see Delitzsch on <a href="/isaiah/23-13.htm">Isaiah 23:13</a>). Habakkuk describes this people as mar, bitter, or rough, and, when used to denote a disposition, fierce (mar nephesh, <a href="/judges/18-25.htm">Judges 18:25</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/17-8.htm">2 Samuel 17:8</a>); and nimha&#770;r, heedless or rash (<a href="/isaiah/32-4.htm">Isaiah 32:4</a>), here violent, and as moving along the breadths of the earth (&#x3b5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2;, lxx: cf. <a href="/revelation/20-9.htm">Revelation 20:9</a>), i.e., marching through the whole extent of the earth (<a href="/isaiah/8-8.htm">Isaiah 8:8</a>): terram quam late patet (Ros.). &#1500; is not used here to denote the direction or the goal, but the space, as in <a href="/genesis/13-17.htm">Genesis 13:17</a> (Hitzig, Delitzsch).

Vav, in the sense of swimming upon the top, and apparently traces pu&#772;sh in <a href="//biblehub.com/nahum/3.htm">Nahum 3</a>, as well as pash in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/35-15.htm">Job 35:15</a>, to Arab. fs&#780;s&#780; (when used of water: to overflow its dam); whilst Freytag (in the Lexicon) gives, as the meaning of Arab. fs&#780;s&#780; II, dissolvit, dissipavit. Pa&#770;ra&#770;sh&#305;&#772;m are horsemen, not riding-horses. The repetition of &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1493; does not warrant our erasing the words &#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468; &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1493; as a gloss, as Hitzig proposes. It can be explained very simply from the fact, that in the second hemistich Habakkuk passes from the general description of the Chaldaeans to a picture of their invasion of Judah.  &#1502;&#1512;&#1495;&#1493;&#1511; , from afar, i.e., from Babylonia (cf. <a href="/isaiah/39-3.htm">Isaiah 39:3</a>). Their coming from afar, and the comparison of the rushing along of the Chaldaean horsemen to the flight of an eagle, points to the threat in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-49.htm">Deuteronomy 28:49</a>, "Jehovah shall bring against thee a nation from far, from the end of the earth, as swift as the eagle flieth," which is now about to be fulfilled. Jeremiah frequently uses the same comparison when speaking of the Chaldaeans, viz., in <a href="/jeremiah/4-13.htm">Jeremiah 4:13</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/48-40.htm">Jeremiah 48:40</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-22.htm">Jeremiah 49:22</a>, and <a href="/lamentations/4-19.htm">Lamentations 4:19</a> (cf. <a href="/2_samuel/1-23.htm">2 Samuel 1:23</a>). The &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. &#1502;&#1490;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; may mean a horde or crowd, after the Hebrew &#1490;&#1501; werbeH , and the Arabic jammah, or snorting, endeavouring, striving, after Arab. jmm and ja&#770;m, appetivit, in which case &#1490;&#1502;&#1501; would be connected with &#1490;&#1502;&#1488;, to swallow. But the first meaning does not suit &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; &#1511;&#1491;&#1497;&#1502;&#1492;, whereas the second does. &#1511;&#1491;&#1497;&#1502;&#1492;, not eastwards, but according to the primary meaning of &#1511;&#1491;&#1501;, to the front, forwards. Ewald renders it incorrectly: "the striving of their face is to storm, i.e., to mischief;" for qa&#770;d&#305;&#772;m, the east wind, when used in the sense of storm, is a figurative expression for that which is vain and worthless (<a href="/hosea/12-2.htm">Hosea 12:2</a>; cf. <a href="/job/15-2.htm">Job 15:2</a>), but not for mischief. For &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1505;&#1507;, compare <a href="/genesis/41-49.htm">Genesis 41:49</a> and <a href="/zechariah/9-3.htm">Zechariah 9:3</a>; and for &#1499;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1500;, like sand of the sea, <a href="/hosea/2-1.htm">Hosea 2:1</a>. In <a href="/habakkuk/1-10.htm">Habakkuk 1:10</a> &#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; and &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; are introduced, that the words &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1499;&#1497;&#1501; and &#1500;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1502;&#1489;&#1510;&#1512;, upon which the emphasis lies, may be placed first. It, the Chaldaean nation, scoffs at kings and princes, and every stronghold, i.e., it ridicules all the resistance that kings and princes offer to its advance, by putting forth their strength, as a perfectly fruitless attempt. Mischa&#770;q, the object of laughter. The words, it heaps up dust and takes it (the fortress), express the facility with which every fortress is conquered by it. To heap up dust: denoting the casting up an embankment for attack (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-15.htm">2 Samuel 20:15</a>, etc.). The feminine suffix attached to &#1497;&#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1491;&#1492;&#1468; refers ad sensum to the idea of a city (&#1506;&#1497;&#1512;), implied in &#1502;&#1489;&#1510;&#1512;, the latter being equivalent to &#1506;&#1497;&#1512; &#1502;&#1489;&#1510;&#1512; in <a href="/1_samuel/6-18.htm">1 Samuel 6:18</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/3-19.htm">2 Kings 3:19</a>, etc. Thus will the Chaldaean continue incessantly to overthrow kings and conquer kingdoms with tempestuous rapidity, till he offends, by deifying his own power. With this gentle hint at the termination of his tyranny, the announcement of the judgment closes in <a href="/habakkuk/1-11.htm">Habakkuk 1:11</a>. &#1488;&#1494;, there, i.e., in this appearance of his, as depicted in <a href="//biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-6.htm">Habakkuk 1:6-10</a> : not "then," in which case <a href="/habakkuk/1-11.htm">Habakkuk 1:11</a> would affirm to what further enterprises the Chaldaeans would proceed after their rapidly and easily effected conquests. The perfects &#1495;&#1500;&#1507; and &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1489;&#1493;&#1512; are used prophetically, representing the future as occurring already. &#1495;&#1500;&#1507; and &#1506;&#1489;&#1512; are used synonymously: to pass along and go further, used of the wind or tempest, as in <a href="/isaiah/21-1.htm">Isaiah 21:1</a>; here, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/8-8.htm">Isaiah 8:8</a>, of the hostile army overflowing the land; with this difference, however, that in Isaiah it is thought of as a stream of water, whereas here it is thought of as a tempest sweeping over the land. The subject to cha&#770;laph is not ru&#772;a&#774;ch, but the Chaldaean (&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;, <a href="/habakkuk/1-10.htm">Habakkuk 1:10</a>); and ru&#772;a&#774;ch is used appositionally, to denote the manner in which it passes along, viz., "like a tempestuous wind" (ru&#772;a&#774;ch as in <a href="/job/30-15.htm">Job 30:15</a>; <a href="/isaiah/7-2.htm">Isaiah 7:2</a>). &#1493;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501; is not a participle, but a perfect with Vav rel., expressing the consequence, "and so he offends." In what way is stated in the last clause, in which &#1494;&#1493;&#1468; does not answer to the relative &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, in the sense of "he whose power," but is placed demonstratively before the noun &#1499;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;, like &#1494;&#1492; in <a href="/exodus/32-1.htm">Exodus 32:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/9-12.htm">Joshua 9:12-13</a>, and <a href="/isaiah/23-13.htm">Isaiah 23:13</a> (cf. Ewald, 293, b), pointing back to the strength of the Chaldaean, which has been previously depicted in its intensive and extensive greatness (Delitzsch). This its power is god to it, i.e., it makes it into its god (for the thought, compare <a href="//biblehub.com/job/12-6.htm">Job 12:6</a>, and the words of the Assyrian in <a href="/isaiah/10-13.htm">Isaiah 10:13</a>). The ordinary explanation of the first hemistich is, on the other hand, untenable (then its courage becomes young again, or grows), since &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; cannot stand for &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;, and &#1506;&#1489;&#1512; without an object given in the context cannot mean to overstep, i.e., to go beyond the proper measure. </body></html>
