This represented the low, melancholy condition of the Jewish church. A man like a warrior sat on a red horse, in the midst of this shady myrtle-grove. Though the church was in a low condition, Christ was present in the midst, ready to appear for the relief of his people. Behind him were angels ready to be employed by him, some in acts of judgment, others of mercy, others in mixed events. Would we know something of the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, we must apply, not to angels, for they are themselves learners, but to Christ himself. He is ready to teach those humbly desirous to learn the things of God. The nations near Judea enjoyed peace at that time, but the state of the Jews was unsettled, which gave rise to the pleading that followed; but mercy must only be hoped for through Christ. His intercession for his church prevails. The Lord answered the Angel, this Angel of the covenant, with promises of mercy and deliverance. All the good words and comfortable words of the gospel we receive from Jesus Christ, as he received them from the Father, in answer to the prayer of his blood; and his ministers are to preach them to all the world. The earth sat still, and was at rest. It is not uncommon for the enemies of God to be at rest in sin, while his people are enduring correction, harassed by temptation, disquieted by fears of wrath, or groaning under oppression and persecution. Here are predictions which had reference to the revival of the Jews after the captivity, but those events were shadows of what shall take place in the church, after the oppression of the New Testament Babylon is ended.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/zechariah/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the man answered - To the question addressed to the attendant-angel.

As he for evil, so these for good. Their office was not a specific or passing duty, as when God sent His angels with some special commission, such as those recorded in Holy Scripture. It was a continuous conversation with the affairs of people, a minute course of visiting, inspecting our human deeds and ways, a part of the "wonderful order" , in which God has "ordained and constituted the services of angels and men." Nor is it said that the angels were limited, each to his own special province, as we learn through Daniel, that certain great angels, princes among them, had the charge of empires or nations, even of the pagan . These angels had apparently only the office of inspecting and reporting to angels of a higher order, themselves a subordinate order in the heavenly Hierarchy. Nor are they spoken of, as executing any judgments of God, or as pacifying the earth; they may have been so employed; but they are only said to have reported the state in which they found it.<p>These answered the unexpressed inquiry of the angel of the Lord, as he had answered the unuttered question of the angel, attendant on Zechariah. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/zechariah/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. answered&#8212;The "angel of the covenant" here gives the reply instead of the interpreting angel, to imply that all communications through the interpreting angel come from Him as their source.<p>Lord hath sent to walk to and fro through the earth&#8212;If "Satan walks to and fro in the earth" (implying restless activity) on errands of mischief to God's people (Job 1:7), the Lord sends other angels to "walk to and fro" with unceasing activity everywhere to counterwork Satan's designs, and to defend His people (Ps 34:7;

The modern hypothesis, that the Chaldaeans were first of all transplanted by the Assyrians from the northern border mountains of Armenia, Media, and Assyria to Babylonia, and that having settled there, they afterwards grew into a cultivated people, and as a conquering nation exerted great influence in the history of the world, simply rests upon a most precarious interpretation of an obscure passage in Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/23-18.htm">Isaiah 23:18</a>), and has no higher value than the opinion of the latest Assyriologists that the Chaldaeans are a people of Tatar origin, who mingled with the Shemites of the countries bordering upon the Euphrates and Tigris (see Delitzsch on <a href="/isaiah/23-13.htm">Isaiah 23:13</a>). Habakkuk describes this people as mar, bitter, or rough, and, when used to denote a disposition, fierce (mar nephesh, <a href="/judges/18-25.htm">Judges 18:25</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/17-8.htm">2 Samuel 17:8</a>); and nimha&#770;r, heedless or rash (<a href="/isaiah/32-4.htm">Isaiah 32:4</a>), here violent, and as moving along the breadths of the earth (&#x3b5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2;, lxx: cf. <a href="/revelation/20-9.htm">Revelation 20:9</a>), i.e., marching through the whole extent of the earth (<a href="/isaiah/8-8.htm">Isaiah 8:8</a>): terram quam late patet (Ros.). &#1500; is not used here to denote the direction or the goal, but the space, as in <a href="/genesis/13-17.htm">Genesis 13:17</a> (Hitzig, Delitzsch). To take possession of dwelling-laces that are not his own (&#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1500;&#1493;  equals  &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1500;&#1493;), i.e., to take possession of foreign lands that do not belong to him. In <a href="/habakkuk/1-7.htm">Habakkuk 1:7</a> the fierce disposition of this people is still further depicted, and in <a href="/habakkuk/1-8.htm">Habakkuk 1:8</a> the violence with which it advances. &#1488;&#1497;&#1501;, formidabilis, exciting terror; &#1504;&#1493;&#1512;&#1488;, metuendus, creating alarm. &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;, from it, not from God (cf. <a href="/psalms/17-2.htm">Psalm 17:2</a>), does its right proceed, i.e., it determines right, and the rule of its conduct, according to its own standard; and &#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1514;&#1493;, its eminence (<a href="/genesis/49-3.htm">Genesis 49:3</a>; <a href="/hosea/13-1.htm">Hosea 13:1</a>), "its &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b1; (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-7.htm">1 Corinthians 11:7</a>) above all other nations" (Hitzig), making itself lord through the might of its arms. Its horses are lighter, i.e., swifter of foot, than panthers, which spring with the greatest rapidity upon their prey (for proofs of the swiftness of the panther, see Bochart, Hieroz. ii. p. 104, ed. Ros.), and &#1495;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, lit., sharper, i.e., shooting sharply upon it. As qa&#770;lal represents swiftness as a light rapid movement, which hardly touches the ground, so cha&#770;da, &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, describes it as a hasty precipitate dash upon a certain object (Delitzsch). The first clause of this verse has been repeated by Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/4-13.htm">Jeremiah 4:13</a>), with the alteration of one letter (viz., &#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; for &#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;). Wolves of the evening (cf. <a href="/zephaniah/3-3.htm">Zephaniah 3:3</a>) are wolves which go out in the evening in search of prey, after having fasted through the day, not "wolves of Arabia (&#1506;&#1512;&#1489;  equals  &#1506;&#1512;&#1489;, lxx) or of the desert" (&#1506;&#1512;&#1489;&#1492; Kimchi).<p>Pa&#770;shu&#772; from pu&#772;sh, after the Arabic fa&#770;s&#780;, med. Ye, to strut proudly; when used of a horse and its rider, to spring along, to gallop; or of a calf, to hop or jump (<a href="/jeremiah/50-11.htm">Jeremiah 50:11</a>; <a href="/malachi/4-2.htm">Malachi 4:2</a>). The connection between this and pu&#772;sh (<a href="/nahum/3-18.htm">Nahum 3:18</a>), niphal to disperse or scatter one's self, is questionable. Delitzsch (on <a href="/job/35-15.htm">Job 35:15</a>) derives pu&#772;sh in this verse and the passage cited from Arab. fa&#770;s&#780;, med. Vav, in the sense of swimming upon the top, and apparently traces pu&#772;sh in <a href="//biblehub.com/nahum/3.htm">Nahum 3</a>, as well as pash in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/35-15.htm">Job 35:15</a>, to Arab. fs&#780;s&#780; (when used of water: to overflow its dam); whilst Freytag (in the Lexicon) gives, as the meaning of Arab. fs&#780;s&#780; II, dissolvit, dissipavit. Pa&#770;ra&#770;sh&#305;&#772;m are horsemen, not riding-horses. The repetition of &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1493; does not warrant our erasing the words &#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468; &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1493; as a gloss, as Hitzig proposes. It can be explained very simply from the fact, that in the second hemistich Habakkuk passes from the general description of the Chaldaeans to a picture of their invasion of Judah.  &#1502;&#1512;&#1495;&#1493;&#1511; , from afar, i.e., from Babylonia (cf. <a href="/isaiah/39-3.htm">Isaiah 39:3</a>). Their coming from afar, and the comparison of the rushing along of the Chaldaean horsemen to the flight of an eagle, points to the threat in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-49.htm">Deuteronomy 28:49</a>, "Jehovah shall bring against thee a nation from far, from the end of the earth, as swift as the eagle flieth," which is now about to be fulfilled. Jeremiah frequently uses the same comparison when speaking of the Chaldaeans, viz., in <a href="/jeremiah/4-13.htm">Jeremiah 4:13</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/48-40.htm">Jeremiah 48:40</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-22.htm">Jeremiah 49:22</a>, and <a href="/lamentations/4-19.htm">Lamentations 4:19</a> (cf. <a href="/2_samuel/1-23.htm">2 Samuel 1:23</a>). The &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. &#1502;&#1490;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; may mean a horde or crowd, after the Hebrew &#1490;&#1501; werbeH , and the Arabic jammah, or snorting, endeavouring, striving, after Arab. jmm and ja&#770;m, appetivit, in which case &#1490;&#1502;&#1501; would be connected with &#1490;&#1502;&#1488;, to swallow. But the first meaning does not suit &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; &#1511;&#1491;&#1497;&#1502;&#1492;, whereas the second does. &#1511;&#1491;&#1497;&#1502;&#1492;, not eastwards, but according to the primary meaning of &#1511;&#1491;&#1501;, to the front, forwards. Ewald renders it incorrectly: "the striving of their face is to storm, i.e., to mischief;" for qa&#770;d&#305;&#772;m, the east wind, when used in the sense of storm, is a figurative expression for that which is vain and worthless (<a href="/hosea/12-2.htm">Hosea 12:2</a>; cf. <a href="/job/15-2.htm">Job 15:2</a>), but not for mischief. For &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1505;&#1507;, compare <a href="/genesis/41-49.htm">Genesis 41:49</a> and <a href="/zechariah/9-3.htm">Zechariah 9:3</a>; and for &#1499;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1500;, like sand of the sea, <a href="/hosea/2-1.htm">Hosea 2:1</a>. In <a href="/habakkuk/1-10.htm">Habakkuk 1:10</a> &#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; and &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; are introduced, that the words &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1499;&#1497;&#1501; and &#1500;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1502;&#1489;&#1510;&#1512;, upon which the emphasis lies, may be placed first. It, the Chaldaean nation, scoffs at kings and princes, and every stronghold, i.e., it ridicules all the resistance that kings and princes offer to its advance, by putting forth their strength, as a perfectly fruitless attempt. Mischa&#770;q, the object of laughter. The words, it heaps up dust and takes it (the fortress), express the facility with which every fortress is conquered by it. To heap up dust: denoting the casting up an embankment for attack (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-15.htm">2 Samuel 20:15</a>, etc.). The feminine suffix attached to &#1497;&#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1491;&#1492;&#1468; refers ad sensum to the idea of a city (&#1506;&#1497;&#1512;), implied in &#1502;&#1489;&#1510;&#1512;, the latter being equivalent to &#1506;&#1497;&#1512; &#1502;&#1489;&#1510;&#1512; in <a href="/1_samuel/6-18.htm">1 Samuel 6:18</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/3-19.htm">2 Kings 3:19</a>, etc. Thus will the Chaldaean continue incessantly to overthrow kings and conquer kingdoms with tempestuous rapidity, till he offends, by deifying his own power. With this gentle hint at the termination of his tyranny, the announcement of the judgment closes in <a href="/habakkuk/1-11.htm">Habakkuk 1:11</a>. &#1488;&#1494;, there, i.e., in this appearance of his, as depicted in <a href="//biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-6.htm">Habakkuk 1:6-10</a> : not "then," in which case <a href="/habakkuk/1-11.htm">Habakkuk 1:11</a> would affirm to what further enterprises the Chaldaeans would proceed after their rapidly and easily effected conquests. The perfects &#1495;&#1500;&#1507; and &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1489;&#1493;&#1512; are used prophetically, representing the future as occurring already. &#1495;&#1500;&#1507; and &#1506;&#1489;&#1512; are used synonymously: to pass along and go further, used of the wind or tempest, as in <a href="/isaiah/21-1.htm">Isaiah 21:1</a>; here, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/8-8.htm">Isaiah 8:8</a>, of the hostile army overflowing the land; with this difference, however, that in Isaiah it is thought of as a stream of water, whereas here it is thought of as a tempest sweeping over the land. The subject to cha&#770;laph is not ru&#772;a&#774;ch, but the Chaldaean (&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;, <a href="/habakkuk/1-10.htm">Habakkuk 1:10</a>); and ru&#772;a&#774;ch is used appositionally, to denote the manner in which it passes along, viz., "like a tempestuous wind" (ru&#772;a&#774;ch as in <a href="/job/30-15.htm">Job 30:15</a>; <a href="/isaiah/7-2.htm">Isaiah 7:2</a>). &#1493;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501; is not a participle, but a perfect with Vav rel., expressing the consequence, "and so he offends." In what way is stated in the last clause, in which &#1494;&#1493;&#1468; does not answer to the relative &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, in the sense of "he whose power," but is placed demonstratively before the noun &#1499;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;, like &#1494;&#1492; in <a href="/exodus/32-1.htm">Exodus 32:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/9-12.htm">Joshua 9:12-13</a>, and <a href="/isaiah/23-13.htm">Isaiah 23:13</a> (cf. Ewald, 293, b), pointing back to the strength of the Chaldaean, which has been previously depicted in its intensive and extensive greatness (Delitzsch). This its power is god to it, i.e., it makes it into its god (for the thought, compare <a href="//biblehub.com/job/12-6.htm">Job 12:6</a>, and the words of the Assyrian in <a href="/isaiah/10-13.htm">Isaiah 10:13</a>). The ordinary explanation of the first hemistich is, on the other hand, untenable (then its courage becomes young again, or grows), since &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; cannot stand for &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;, and &#1506;&#1489;&#1512; without an object given in the context cannot mean to overstep, i.e., to go beyond the proper measure. </body></html>
