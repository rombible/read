Inward indifference, not outward opposition, is the real reason for slow progress in God’s work, and prophets who see visions and preach repentance are the true practical men.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> This vision followed Haggai’s prophecy at the interval of a month. It falls into two parts-a symbolical vision and a series of promises founded on it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. The Symbolical Vision</span> {<a href="/zechariah/3-1.htm" title="And he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him.">Zechariah 3:1</a> - <a href="/zechariah/3-5.htm" title="And I said, Let them set a fair turban on his head. So they set a fair turban on his head, and clothed him with garments. And the angel of the LORD stood by.">Zechariah 3:5</a>}.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The scene of the vision is left undetermined, and the absence of any designation of locality gives the picture the sublimity of indefiniteness. Three figures, seen he knows not where, stand clear before the Prophet’s inward eye. They were shown him by an unnamed person, who is evidently Jehovah Himself. The real and the ideal are marvellously mingled in the conception of Joshua the high priest-the man whom the people saw every day going about Jerusalem-standing at the bar of God, with Satan as his accuser. The trial is in process when the Prophet is permitted to see. We do not hear the pleadings on either side, but the sentence is solemnly recorded. The accusations are dismissed, their bringer rebuked, and in token of acquittal, the filthy garments which the accused had worn are changed for the full festal attire of the high priest.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> What, then, is the meaning of this grand symbolism? The first point to keep well in view is the representative character of the high priest. He appears as laden not with individual but national sins. In him Israel is, as it were, concentrated, and what befalls him is the image of what befalls the nation. His dirty dress is the familiar symbol of sin; and he wears it, just as he wore his sacerdotal dress, in his official capacity, as the embodied nation. He stands before the judgment seat, bearing not his own but the people’s sins.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Two great truths are thereby taught, which are as true to-day as ever. The first is that representation is essential to priesthood. It was so in shadowy and external fashion in Israel; it is so in deepest and most blessed reality in Christ’s priesthood. He stands before God as our representative-’And the Lord hath made to meet on Him the iniquity of us all.’ If by faith we unite ourselves with Him, there ensues a wondrous transference of characteristics, so that our sin becomes His, and His righteousness becomes ours; and that in no mere artificial or forensic sense, but in inmost reality. Theologians talk of a <span class="ital">communicatio idiomatum</span> as between the human and the divine elements in Christ. There is an analogous passage of the attributes of either to the other, in the relation of the believer to his Saviour.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The second thought in this symbolic appearance of Joshua before the angel of the Lord is that the sins of God’s people are even now present before His perfect judgment, as reasons for withdrawing from them His favour. That is a solemn truth, which should never be forgotten. A Christian man’s sins do accuse him at the bar of God. They are all visible there; and so far as their tendency goes, they are like wedges driven in to rend him from God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> But the second figure in the vision is ‘the Satan,’ standing in the plaintiff’s place at the Judge’s right hand, to accuse Joshua. The Old Testament teaching as to the evil spirit who ‘accuses’ good men is not so developed as that of the New, which is quite natural, inasmuch as the shadow of bright light is deeper than that of faint rays. It is most full in the latest books, as here and in Job; but doctrinal inferences drawn from such highly imaginative symbolism as this are precarious. No one who accepts the authority of our Lord can well deny the existence and activity of a malignant spirit, who would fain make the most of men’s sins, and use them as a means of separating their doers from God. That is the conception here.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> But the main stress of the vision lies, not on the accuser or his accusation, but on the Judge’s sentence, which alone is recorded. ‘The Angel of the Lord’ is named in <a href="/zechariah/3-1.htm" title="And he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him.">Zechariah 3:1</a> as the Judge, while the sentence in <a href="/zechariah/3-2.htm" title="And the LORD said to Satan, The LORD rebuke you, O Satan; even the LORD that has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you: is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?">Zechariah 3:2</a> is spoken by ‘the Lord.’ It would lead us far away from our purpose to inquire whether that Angel of the Lord is an earlier manifestation of the eternal Son, who afterwards became flesh-a kind of preluding or rehearsing of the Incarnation. But in any case, God so dwells in Him as that what the Angel says God says and the speaker varies as in our text. The accuser is rebuked, and God’s rebuke is not a mere word, but brings with it punishment. The malicious accusations have failed, and their aim is to be gathered from the language which announces their miscarriage. Obviously Satan sought to procure the withdrawal of divine favour from Joshua, because of his sin; that is, to depose the nation from its place as the covenant people, because of its transgressions of the covenant. Satan here represents what might otherwise have been called, in theological language, ‘the demands of justice.’ The answer given him is deeply instructive as to the grounds of the divine forbearance.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Note that Joshua’s guilt as the representative of the people is not denied, but tacitly admitted and actually spoken of in <a href="/zechariah/3-4.htm" title="And he answered and spoke to those that stood before him, saying, Take away the filthy garments from him. And to him he said, Behold, I have caused your iniquity to pass from you, and I will clothe you with change of raiment.">Zechariah 3:4</a>. Why, then, does not the accuser have his way? For two reasons. God has chosen Jerusalem. His great purpose, the fruit of His undeserved mercy, is not to be turned aside by man’s sins. The thought is the same as that of Jeremiah: ‘If heaven above can be measured . . . then I will also cast off all the seed of Israel for all that they have done’ {<a href="/jeremiah/31-37.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; If heaven above can be measured, and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath, I will also cast off all the seed of Israel for all that they have done, said the LORD.">Jeremiah 31:37</a>}. Again, the fact that Joshua was ‘a brand plucked from the burning’-that is, that the people whom he represented had been brought unconsumed from the furnace of captivity-is a reason with God for continuing to extend His favour, though they have sinned. God’s past mercies are a motive with him. Creatural love is limited, and too often says, ‘I have forgiven so often, that I am wearied, and can do it no more.’ He <span class="ital">has</span>, therefore he <span class="ital">will</span>. We often come to the end of our long-suffering a good many times short of the four hundred and ninety a day which Christ prescribes. But God never does. True, Joshua and his people have sinned, and that since their restoration, and Satan had a good argument in pointing to these transgressions; but God does not say, ‘I will put back the half-burned brand in the fire again, since the evil is not burned out of it,’ but forgives again, because He has forgiven before.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The sentence is followed by the exchange of the filthy garments symbolical of sin, for the full array of the high priest. Ministering angels are dimly seen in the background, and are summoned to unclothe and clothe Joshua. The Prophet ventures to ask that the sacerdotal attire should be completed by the turban or mitre, probably that headdress which bore the significant writing ‘Holiness to the Lord,’ expressive of the destination of Israel and of its ceremonial cleanness. The meaning of this change of clothing is given in <a href="/zechariah/3-4.htm" title="And he answered and spoke to those that stood before him, saying, Take away the filthy garments from him. And to him he said, Behold, I have caused your iniquity to pass from you, and I will clothe you with change of raiment.">Zechariah 3:4</a> : ‘I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee.’ Thus the complete restoration of the pardoned and cleansed nation to its place as a nation of priests to Jehovah is symbolised. To us the gospel of forgiveness fills up the outline in the vision; and we know how, when sin testifies against us, we have an Advocate with the Father, and how the infinite love flows out to us notwithstanding all sin, and how the stained garment of our souls can be stripped off, and the ‘fine linen clean and white,’ the priestly dress on the day of atonement, be put on us, and we be made priests unto God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. The remainder of the vision is the address of the Angel of the Lord to Joshua, developing the blessings now made sure to him and his people by this renewed consecration and cleansing.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> First {<a href="/zechariah/3-7.htm" title="Thus said the LORD of hosts; If you will walk in my ways, and if you will keep my charge, then you shall also judge my house, and shall also keep my courts, and I will give you places to walk among these that stand by.">Zechariah 3:7</a>} is the promise of continuance in office and access to God’s presence, which, however, are contingent on obedience. The forgiven man must keep God’s charge, if he is to retain his standing. On that condition, he has ‘a place of access among those that stand by’; that is, the privilege of approach to God, like the attendant angels. This promise may be taken as surpassing the prerogatives hitherto accorded to the high priest, who had only the right of entrance into the holiest place once a year, but now is promised the <span class="ital">entrée</span> to the heavenly court, as if he were one of the bright spirits who stand there. They who have access with confidence within the veil because Christ is there, have more than the ancient promise of this vision.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The main point of <a href="/zechariah/3-8.htm" title="Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, you, and your fellows that sit before you: for they are men wondered at: for, behold, I will bring forth my servant the BRANCH.">Zechariah 3:8</a> is the promise of the Messiah, but the former part of the verse is remarkable. Joshua and his fellows are summoned to listen, ‘for they are men which are a sign.’ The meaning seems to be that he and his brethren who sat as his assessors in official functions, are collectively a sign or embodied prophecy of what is to come. Their restoration to their offices was a shadowy prophecy of a greater act of forgiving grace, which was to be effected by the coming of the Messiah.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The name ‘Branch’ is used here as a proper name. Jeremiah {<a href="/jeremiah/23-5.htm" title="Behold, the days come, said the LORD, that I will raise to David a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper, and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth.">Jeremiah 23:5</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/33-15.htm" title="In those days, and at that time, will I cause the Branch of righteousness to grow up to David; and he shall execute judgment and righteousness in the land.">Jeremiah 33:15</a>} had already employed it as a designation of Messiah, which he had apparently learned from <a href="/isaiah/4-2.htm" title="In that day shall the branch of the LORD be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped of Israel.">Isaiah 4:2</a>. The idea of the word is that of the similar names used by Isaiah, ‘a shoot out of the stock of Jesse, and a Branch out of his roots’ {<a href="/isaiah/11-1.htm" title="And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots:">Isaiah 11:1</a>}, and ‘a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground’ {<a href="/isaiah/53-2.htm" title="For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he has no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him.">Isaiah 53:2</a>}; namely, that of his origin from the fallen house of David, and the lowliness of his appearance.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The Messiah is again meant by the ‘stone’ in <a href="/zechariah/3-9.htm" title="For behold the stone that I have laid before Joshua; on one stone shall be seven eyes: behold, I will engrave the engraving thereof, said the LORD of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.">Zechariah 3:9</a>. Probably there was some great stone taken from the ruins, to which the symbol attaches itself. The foundation of the second Temple had been laid years before the prophecy, but the stone may still have been visible. The Rabbis have much to say about a great stone which had been in the first Temple, and there used for the support of the ark, but in the second was set in the empty place where the ark should have been. Isaiah had prophesied of the ‘tried corner-stone’ laid in Zion, and <a href="/psalms/118-22.htm" title="The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone of the corner.">Psalm 118:22</a> had sung of the stone rejected and made the head of the corner. We go in the track, then, of established usage, when we see in this stone the emblem of Messiah, and associate with it all thoughts of firmness, preciousness, support, foundation of the true Temple, basis of hope, ground of certitude, and whatever other substratum of fixity and immovableness men’s hearts or lives need. In all possible aspects of the metaphor, Jesus is the Foundation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> And what are the ‘seven eyes on the stone’? That may simply be a vivid way of saying that the fulness of divine Providence would watch over the Messiah, bringing Him when the time was ripe, and fitting Him for His work. But if we remember the subsequent explanation {<a href="/zechariah/4-10.htm" title="For who has despised the day of small things? for they shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel with those seven; they are the eyes of the LORD, which run to and fro through the whole earth.">Zechariah 4:10</a>} of the ‘seven,’ as ‘the eyes of the Lord which run to and fro through the whole earth,’ and connect this with <a href="/revelation/5-6.htm" title="And I beheld, and, see, in the middle of the throne and of the four beasts, and in the middle of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.">Revelation 5:6</a>, we can scarcely rest content with that meaning, but find here the deeper thought that the fulness of the divine Spirit was given to Messiah, even as <a href="/isaiah/11-2.htm" title="And the spirit of the LORD shall rest on him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the LORD;">Isaiah 11:2</a> prophesies of the sevenfold Spirit.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> ‘I will engrave the graving thereof’ is somewhat obscure. It seems to mean that the seven eyes will be cut on the stone, like masons’ marks. If the seven eyes are the full energies of the Holy Spirit, God’s cutting of them on the stone is equivalent to His giving them to His Son; and the fulfilment of the promise was when He gave the Holy Spirit not ‘by measure unto Him.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The blessed purpose of Messiah’s coming and endowment with the Spirit is gloriously stated in the last clause of <a href="/zechariah/3-9.htm" title="For behold the stone that I have laid before Joshua; on one stone shall be seven eyes: behold, I will engrave the engraving thereof, said the LORD of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.">Zechariah 3:9</a> : ‘I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.’ Jesus Christ has ‘once for all’ made atonement, as the Epistle to the Hebrews so often says. The better Joshua by one offering has taken away sin. ‘The breadth of Thy land, O Immanuel,’ stretched far beyond the narrow bounds which Zechariah knew for Israel’s territory. It includes the whole world. As has been beautifully said, ‘That one day is the day of Golgotha.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The vision closes with a picture of the felicity of Messianic times, which recalls the description of the golden age of Solomon, when ‘Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his fig-tree’ {<a href="/1_kings/4-25.htm" title="And Judah and Israel dwelled safely, every man under his vine and under his fig tree, from Dan even to Beersheba, all the days of Solomon.">1 Kings 4:25</a>}. In like manner the nation, cleansed, restored to its priestly privilege of free access to God by the Messiah who comes with the fulness of the Spirit, shall dwell in safety, and shall be knit together by friendship, and unenvyingly shall each share his good with all others, recognising in every man a neighbour, and gladly welcoming him to partake of all the blessings which the true Solomon has brought to his house and heart.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/zechariah/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/zechariah/3-1.htm" title="And he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him.">Zechariah 3:1</a></span>. <span class="ital">And he showed me — He, </span>that is, the angel, who talked with him, after delivering the message in the preceding chapter, proceeded to another representation; <span class="ital">Joshua the high-priest, </span>&c. — We find from Haggai, that Joshua the son of Josedech was at this time high-priest.

Guilt and corruption are great discouragements when we stand before God. By the guilt of the sins committed by us, we are liable to the justice of God; by the power of sin that dwells in us, we are hateful to the holiness of God. Even God's Israel are in danger on these accounts; but they have relief from Jesus Christ, who is made of God to us both righteousness and sanctification. Joshua, the high priest, is accused as a criminal, but is justified. When we stand before God, to minister to him, or stand up for God, we must expect to meet all the resistance Satan's subtlety and malice can give. Satan is checked by one that has conquered him, and many times silenced him. Those who belong to Christ, will find him ready to appear for them, when Satan appears most strongly against them. A converted soul is a brand plucked out of the fire by a miracle of free grace, therefore shall not be left a prey to Satan. Joshua appears as one polluted, but is purified; he represents the Israel of God, who are all as an unclean thing, till they are washed and sanctified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God. Israel now were free from idolatry, but there were many things amiss in them. There were spiritual enemies warring against them, more dangerous than any neighbouring nations. Christ loathed the filthiness of Joshua's garments, yet did not put him away. Thus God by his grace does with those whom he chooses to be priests to himself. The guilt of sin is taken away by pardoning mercy, and the power of it is broken by renewing grace. Thus Christ washes those from their sins in his own blood, whom he makes kings and priests to our God. Those whom Christ makes spiritual priests, are clothed with the spotless robe of his righteousness, and appear before God in that; and with the graces of his Spirit, which are ornaments to them. The righteousness of saints, both imputed and implanted, is the fine linen, clean and white, with which the bride, the Lamb's wife, is arrayed, Re 19:8. Joshua is restored to former honours and trusts. The crown of the priesthood is put on him. When the Lord designs to restore and revive religion, he stirs up prophets and people to pray for it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/zechariah/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And He - God, (for the office of the attendant angel was to explain, not to show the visions) "showed me Joshua the high priest, standing before the Angel of the Lord;" probably to be judged by him ; as in the New Testament, "to stand before the Son of Man;" for although "standing before," whether in relation to man  or God, , expresses attendance upon, yet here it appears only as a condition, contemporaneous with that of Satan's, to accuse him. Although, moreover, the Angel speaks with authority, yet God's Presence in him is not spoken of so distinctly, that the high priest would be exhibited as standing before him, as in his office before God.<p>And Satan - Etymologically, the enemy, as, in the New Testament, "your adversary the devil" <a href="//biblehub.com/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>, etymologically, the accuser. It is a proper name of the Evil one, yet its original meaning, "the enemy, was not lost. Here, as in Job, his malice is shown in accusation; "the accuser of our brethren, who accused them before our God, day and night" <a href="/revelation/12-10.htm">Revelation 12:10</a>. In Job J<a href="//biblehub.com/obadiah/1-8.htm">Obadiah 1:8-11</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/2-3.htm">Job 2:3-5</a>, the accusations were calumnious; here, doubtless, true. For he accused Job of what would have been plain apostacy <a href="/job/1-11.htm">Job 1:11</a>; <a href="/job/2-5.htm">Job 2:5</a>; Joshua and Zerubbabel had shared, or given way to, the remissness of the people, as to the rebuilding of the temple and the full restoration of the worship of God <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/3-1.htm">Ezra 3:1-13</a>; 4. For this, Haggai had reproved the people, through them <a href="//biblehub.com/haggai/1-1.htm">Haggai 1:1-11</a>. Satan had then a real charge, on which to implead them. Since also the whole series of visions relates to the restoration from the captivity, the guilt, for which Satan impleads him with Jerusalem and Jerusalem in him, includes the whole guilt, which had rested upon them, so that for a time God had seemed to have cast "away His people" <a href="/romans/11-1.htm">Romans 11:1</a>.

Fourth Vision. Joshua the high priest before the angel of Jehovah; accused by Satan, but justified by Jehovah through Messiah the coming Branch.<p>1. Joshua as high priest (Hag 1:1) represents "Jerusalem" (Zec 3:2), or the elect people, put on its trial, and "plucked" narrowly "out of the fire." His attitude, "standing before the Lord," is that of a high priest ministering before the altar erected previously to the building of the temple (Ezr 3:2, 3, 6; Ps 135:2). Yet, in this position, by reason of his own and his people's sins, he is represented as on his and their trial (Nu 35:12).<p>he showed me&#8212;"He" is the interpreting angel. Jerusalem's (Joshua's) "filthy garments" (Zec 3:3) are its sins which had hitherto brought down God's judgments. The "change of raiment" implies its restoration to God's favor. Satan suggested to the Jews that so consciously polluted a priesthood and people could offer no acceptable sacrifice to God, and therefore they might as well desist from the building of the temple. Zechariah encourages them by showing that their demerit does not disqualify them for the work, as they are accepted in the righteousness of another, their great High Priest, the Branch (Zec 3:8), a scion of their own royal line of David (Isa 11:1). The full accomplishment of Israel's justification and of Satan the accuser's being "rebuked" finally, is yet future (Re 12:10). Compare Re 11:8, wherein "Jerusalem," as here, is shown to be meant primarily, though including the whole Church in general (compare Job 1:9).<p>Satan&#8212;the Hebrew term meaning "adversary" in a law court: as devil is the Greek term, meaning accuser. Messiah, on the other hand, is "advocate" for His people in the court of heaven's justice (1Jo 2:1).<p>standing at his right hand&#8212;the usual position of a prosecutor or accuser in court, as the left hand was the position of the defendant (Ps 109:6). The "angel of the Lord" took the same position just before another high priest was about to beget the forerunner of Messiah (Lu 1:11), who supplants Satan from his place as accuser. Some hence explain Jude 9 as referring to this passage: "the body of Moses" being thus the Jewish Church, for which Satan contended as his by reason of its sins; just as the "body of Christ" is the Christian Church. However, Jude 9 plainly speaks of the literal body of Moses, the resurrection of which at the transfiguration Satan seems to have opposed on the ground of Moses' error at Meribah; the same divine rebuke, "the Lord rebuke thee," checked Satan in contending for judgment against Moses' body, as checked him when demanding judgment against the Jewish Church, to which Moses' body corresponds.Under the type of Joshua the high priest receiving clean garments, <span class="bld"><a href="/context/zechariah/3-1.htm" title="And he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him....">Zechariah 3:1-5</a></span>, and a covenant of promise from God, <span class="bld"><a href="/zechariah/3-6.htm" title="And the angel of the LORD protested to Joshua, saying,">Zechariah 3:6</a>,7</span>, Christ, the Branch and Corner-stone, is foretold, <span class="bld"><a href="/context/zechariah/3-8.htm" title="Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, you, and your fellows that sit before you: for they are men wondered at: for, behold, I will bring forth my servant the BRANCH....">Zechariah 3:8-10</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="bld">And he; </span> the Lord of hosts, whose servant Zechariah was, and in whose name he spake. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Showed me; </span> in vision represented to me, Zechariah. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Joshua the high priest; </span> for that office was by hereditary right descended on him, and how mean soever his state was, yet still he was that great officer of the church. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Standing; </span> either as accused, and to make his defence; or rather ministering in his office, according to his duty. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Before the angel:</span> this angel was Christ, whose minister, or servant, the high priest was, as well as type of him.

Who was one that came up out of the captivity, and was principally concerned in building the temple, and had many enemies to obstruct him in it; and who falling into sin, or his sons, in marrying strange wives, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/10-18.htm">Ezra 10:18</a>, which he might connive at, Satan was ready to catch it up, and accuse him before God; though rather Joshua is to be considered, not personally, but typically, representing the state and condition of the priesthood, in which office he was; and which was very low, mean, and abject, under the second temple; or the church of God, which the priests, especially the high priest, were representatives of: and indeed this vision may be accommodated to the case of any single believer, fallen into sin, and accused by Satan, and whose advocate Christ is: <p>standing before the Angel of the Lord; not any created angel, but Christ the Angel of God's presence, who is called Jehovah, <a href="/zechariah/3-2.htm">Zechariah 3:2</a> is the rebuker of Satan, and the advocate of his people; and who takes away their sins, and clothes them with his righteousness: and "standing before" him does not mean barely being in his sight and presence, but as ministering to him; this being the posture both of angels and men, the servants of the Lord, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/7-10.htm">Daniel 7:10</a>, either he was offering sacrifice for the people, or asking counsel of God for them; or rather giving thanks for his and their deliverance from captivity, being as brands taken out of the fire; and praying to be stripped of his filthy garments, and to be clothed with others more decent, and becoming his office; and for help and assistance in the building of the temple, and against those that obstructed him: also he was brought and placed here as a guilty person, charged with sin, and to be tried before him, <p>Satan standing at his right hand to resist him; either to hinder him in his work of building the temple, by stirring up Sanballat, and other enemies; or rather to accuse him of sin, and bring a charge against him, and get sentence passed upon him; so the accuser used to stand at the right hand of the accused. The Targum paraphrases it, <p>"and sin standing at his right hand to resist him:'' <p>when the people of God fall into sin, Satan the accuser of the brethren, their avowed enemy, observes it, and accuses them before the Lord, and seeks their condemnation. Maimonides (p) understands this of his standing at the right hand of the angel; but it was not usual for the prosecutor, accuser, or pleader, whether for or against a person arraigned, to stand the right hand of the judge: indeed, in the Jewish sanhedrim, or grand court of judicature, there were two scribes stood before the judges; the one on the right hand, the other on the left; who took down in writing the pleadings in court, and the sentences of those that were acquitted, and of those that were condemned; he on the right hand the former, and the other on the left hand the latter (q). The prince or chief judge of the court sat in the middle; and his deputy, called "Ab Beth Din", or father of the court, sat at his right hand; and a wise man, a principal one, at his left (r); but it was usual for the pleader, who was called , "Baal Rib", to stand on the right hand of the party cited into the court, whether he pleaded for or against him (s): and to this custom is the allusion here, and in <a href="/psalms/106-6.htm">Psalm 106:6</a> where Satan, who is the accuser of men, and pleads against them, is placed at the right hand, as here; and God, who pleads the cause of his poor people, is also represented as standing on their right hand. The business of Satan here was to accuse, to bring charges, to plead for condemnation, and endeavour to get the sentence of it passed against Joshua; for he was at his right hand, to be an "adversary" to him, as his name (Satan) signifies, which he has from <p>the word here used; being an enemy to mankind in general, and especially to the people of God, and more especially to persons in sacred public offices; to whom he is  "a court adversary", as the Apostle Peter calls him, <a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a> who appears in open court against them, and charges them in a most spiteful and malicious manner; and is a most, implacable, obstinate, and impudent one, as his name signifies, and the word from whence it is derived (t); though Maimonides (u) thinks the name is derived from  which signifies to decline, or go back from anything; since he, without doubt, makes men to decline from the way of truth to the way of falsehood and error. <p>(p) Moreh Nevochim, par. 3. c. 22. p. 398.

During the lifetime of Josedech, while the Temple was in ruins and the people in captivity, the High Priesthood was in abeyance. After an interval of about 52 years, Josedech being now dead, the office was revived in the person of his son. Joshua was the first of the third or last series of High Priests, those, namely, who came after the Captivity.

V. The verb and the noun (Satan) have the same root. The charge against Joshua has been thought to be a personal one, and reference has been made to <a href="/ezra/10-18.htm" title="And among the sons of the priests there were found that had taken strange wives: namely, of the sons of Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brothers; Maaseiah, and Eliezer, and Jarib, and Gedaliah.">Ezra 10:18</a>, to prove that some of his sons had polluted themselves by marrying strange wives. The passage in Ezra however, is at least 60 years later than the vision in Zechariah. It is better to regard the intended accusation as including both personal and official transgressions, his own sins and the sins of the people (<a href="/hebrews/5-3.htm" title="And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.">Hebrews 5:3</a>; <a href="/hebrews/7-27.htm" title="Who needs not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people's: for this he did once, when he offered up himself.">Hebrews 7:27</a>). Sin, the sin of the man and of the order to which he belongs, of the individual and of the nation which he represents, stands in the way of the promised blessing, and must first be put away before that blessing can be enjoyed.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/zechariah/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-10.</span> - &sect; 6. <span class="accented">The fourth vision: Joshua the high priest before the angel.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He showed me.</span> The Septuagint and Vulgate give, "The Lord showed me." Some suppose that it was the interpreting angel who showed this vision; but his duty was to explain, not to present, the visions. So in <a href="/zechariah/1-20.htm">Zechariah 1:20</a> it is the Lord who shows the "four craftsmen." This vision is closely connected with the last. In that it was declared that the Lord would again dwell in Jerusalem, and visit his people with blessings. But to fit them for the presence and favour of Jehovah they must be pure. To this end they must have a holy priesthood to train them in righteous ways, to oppose the attacks of the adversary, and to intercede for them effectually. The removal of their impurity is represented in the fourth vision. <span class="cmt_word">Joshua the high priest</span> (see note on Haggai 1:1). The name is written Joshua in <a href="/ezra/2-2.htm">Ezra 2:2</a>, etc. He was the first of the high priests after the Captivity, succeeding, as by hereditary right, his father Josedech, who died in Babylon. For his services in restoring the temple he is praised among great men in Ecclus. 49:12. <span class="cmt_word">Standing before the angel of the Lord</span>. Joshua is the representative of the priesthoood, and through that also of the whole people. The angel of Jehovah (see notes on Zechariah 1:11, 13) is the representative of and endowed with attributes of Jehovah, the Friend and Leader  of Israel. The phrase, "standing before," is used in a ministerial sense, as of a servant rendering service to a superior (<a href="/genesis/41-46.htm">Genesis 41:46</a>; <a href="/1_kings/12-6.htm">1 Kings 12:6, 8</a>), and a priest or Levite performing his official duties (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-8.htm">Deuteronomy 10:8</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/44-15.htm">Ezekiel 44:15</a>) : also, in a judicial sense, of a person appearing before a judge, either as plaintiff (<a href="/numbers/27-2.htm">Numbers 27:2</a>; <a href="/1_kings/3-16.htm">1 Kings 3:16</a>) or defendant (<a href="/numbers/35-12.htm">Numbers 35:12</a>). Many commentators find in this scene a judicial process, Joshua appearing before the angel as before his judge; and Ewald supposes that it adumbrates his actual accusation at the Persian court, The mention of the adversary at the right hand (<a href="/psalms/109-6.htm">Psalm 109:6</a>) is supposed to confirm this interpretation. But it is obvious that the adversary might stand at the right hand, not as a formal accuser in a trial, but in order to resist and hinder Joshua's proceedings; the angel, too, is not represented as sitting on a throne of judgment, but standing by (ver. 5), and there is no further intimation of any judicial process in the vision. It is therefore best to conceive that Joshua is interceding for the people in his official capacity in the presence of the representative of Jehovah. The locality is not specified; it may have been before the altar, which, we know, was built and used at this time. The special mention of his garments implies that he was engaged in official duties in a consecrated spot; but the place is immaterial. <span class="cmt_word">Satan</span>; <span class="accented">the adversary</span>, or <span class="accented">accuser</span>. The personality of Satan is here plainly recognized, as in <a href="/job/1-6.htm">Job 1:6</a>, etc.; Job 2:1, etc., rendered by the LXX. in all these places, <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (see Appendix B, in Archdeacon Perowne's 'Commentary on Zechariah'). <span class="cmt_word">At his</span> (Joshua's) <span class="cmt_word">right hand.</span> Not as a judicial accuser, but as an enemy to resist his efforts for the good of the people, and to thwart his interests with the angel of the Lord. <span class="cmt_word">To resist him;</span> <span class="accented">to act the adversary to him.</span> The verb is cognate to, the noun above. From what follows we must suppose that Satan objects against Joshua both his own personal sin and the transgressions of the people whose burden he bore (comp. ver. 9, where his sin is called "the iniquity of the land," which would include the guilt which had led to the Captivity, their dilatoriness in building the temple, and all their backslidings since the return). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/habakkuk/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The fourth woe is an exclamation uttered concerning the cruelty of the Chaldaean in the treatment of the conquered nations. <a href="/habakkuk/2-15.htm">Habakkuk 2:15</a>.

For the wickedness at Lebanon will cover thee, and the dispersion of the animals which frightened them; for the blood of the men and the wickedness on the earth, upon the city and all its inhabitants." The description in <a href="/habakkuk/2-15.htm">Habakkuk 2:15</a> and <a href="/habakkuk/2-16.htm">Habakkuk 2:16</a> is figurative, and the figure is taken from ordinary life, where one man gives another drink, so as to intoxicate him, for the purpose of indulging his own wantonness at his expense, or taking delight in his shame. This helps to explain the &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1492; &#1512;&#1506;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;, who gives his neighbour to drink. The singular is used with indefinite generality, or in a collective, or speaking more correctly, a distributive sense. The next two circumstantial clauses are subordinate to &#1492;&#1493;&#1497; &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1492;, defining more closely the mode of the drinking. &#1505;&#1508;&#1468;&#1495; does not mean to pour in, after the Arabic sfh&#803;; for this, which is another form for Arab. sfk, answers to the Hebrew &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1498;, to pour out (compare &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1498; &#1495;&#1502;&#1514;&#1493;, to pour out, or empty out His wrath: <a href="/psalms/79-6.htm">Psalm 79:6</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/10-25.htm">Jeremiah 10:25</a>), but has merely the meaning to add or associate, with the sole exception of <a href="//biblehub.com/job/14-19.htm">Job 14:19</a>, where it is apparently used to answer to the Arabic sfh&#803;; consequently here, where drink is spoken of, it means to mix wrath with the wine poured out. Through the suffix &#1495;&#1502;&#1514;&#1498; the woe is addressed directly to the Chaldaean himself, - a change from the third person to the second, which would be opposed to the genius of our language. The thought is sharpened by &#1493;&#1488;&#1507; &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;, "and also (in addition) making drunk" (shakke&#772;r, inf. abs.). To look upon their nakednesses: the plural &#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; is used because &#1512;&#1506;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; has a collective meaning. The prostrate condition of the drunken man is a figurative representation of the overthrow of a conquered nation (<a href="/nahum/3-11.htm">Nahum 3:11</a>), and the uncovering of the shame a figure denoting the ignominy that has fallen upon it (<a href="/nahum/3-5.htm">Nahum 3:5</a>; <a href="/isaiah/47-3.htm">Isaiah 47:3</a>). This allegory, in which the conquest and subjugation of the nations are represented as making them drink of the cup of wrath, does not refer to the open violence with which the Chaldaean enslaves the nations, but points to the artifices with which he overpowers them, "the cunning with which he entices them into his alliance, to put them to shame" (Delitzsch). But he has thereby simply prepared shame for himself, which will fall back upon him (<a href="/habakkuk/2-16.htm">Habakkuk 2:16</a>). The perfect &#1513;&#1474;&#1489;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468; does not apply prophetically to the certain future; but, as in the earlier strophes (<a href="/habakkuk/2-8.htm">Habakkuk 2:8</a> and <a href="/habakkuk/2-10.htm">Habakkuk 2:10</a>) which are formed in a similar manner, to what the Chaldaean has done, to bring upon himself the punishment mentioned in what follows. The shame with which he has satisfied himself is the shamefulness of his conduct; and &#1513;&#1474;&#1489;&#1506;, to satisfy himself, is equivalent to revelling in shame. &#1502;&#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491;, far away from honour, i.e., and not in honour. &#1502;&#1503; is the negative, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/52-5.htm">Psalm 52:5</a>, in the sense of &#1493;&#1500;&#1488;, with which it alternates in <a href="/hosea/6-6.htm">Hosea 6:6</a>. For this he is now also to drink the cup of wrath, so as to fall down intoxicated, and show himself as having a foreskin, i.e., as uncircumcised ( &#1492;&#1506;&#1512;&#1500;  from  &#1506;&#1512;&#1500;&#1492; ). This goblet Jehovah will hand to him. Tisso&#772;bh, he will turn. &#1506;&#1500; (upon thee, or to thee). This is said, because the cup which the Chaldaean had reached to other nations was also handed over to him by Jehovah. The nations have hitherto been obliged to drink it out of the hand of the Chaldaean. Now it is his turn, and he must drink it out of the hand of Jehovah (see <a href="/jeremiah/25-26.htm">Jeremiah 25:26</a>). &#1493;&#1511;&#1497;&#1511;&#1500;&#1493;&#1503;, and shameful vomiting, (sc., &#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492;) will be over thine honour, i.e., will cover over thine honour or glory, i.e., will destroy thee. The &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. &#1511;&#1497;&#1511;&#1500;&#1493;&#1503; is formed from the pilpal &#1511;&#1500;&#1511;&#1500; from &#1511;&#1500;&#1500;, and softened down from &#1511;&#1500;&#1511;&#1500;&#1493;&#1503;, and signifies extreme or the greatest contempt. This form of the word, however, is chosen for the sake of the play upon &#1511;&#1497;&#1488; &#1511;&#1500;&#1493;&#1503;, vomiting of shame, vomitus ignominiae (Vulg.; cf. &#1511;&#1497;&#1488; &#1510;&#1488;&#1492; in <a href="/isaiah/28-8.htm">Isaiah 28:8</a>), and in order that, when the word was heard, it should call up the subordinate meaning, which suggests itself the more naturally, because excessive drinking is followed by vomiting (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-26.htm">Jeremiah 25:26-27</a>).<p>This threat is explained in <a href="//biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-17.htm">Habakkuk 2:17</a>, in the statement that the wickedness practised by the Chaldaean on Lebanon and its beasts will cover or fall back upon itself. Lebanon with its beasts is taken by most commentators allegorically, as a figurative representation of the holy land and its inhabitants. But although it may be pleaded, in support of this view, that Lebanon, and indeed the summit of its cedar forest, is used in <a href="/jeremiah/22-6.htm">Jeremiah 22:6</a> as a symbol of the royal family of Judaea, and in <a href="/jeremiah/22-23.htm">Jeremiah 22:23</a> as a figure denoting Jerusalem, and that in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/37-24.htm">Isaiah 37:24</a>, and probably also in <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/11-1.htm">Zechariah 11:1</a>, the mountains of Lebanon, as the northern frontier of the Israelitish land, are mentioned synecdochically for the land itself, and the hewing of its cedars and cypresses may be a figurative representation of the devastation of the land and its inhabitants; these passages do not, for all that, furnish any conclusive evidence of the correctness of this view, inasmuch as in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/10-33.htm">Isaiah 10:33-34</a>, Lebanon with its forest is also a figure employed to denote the grand Assyrian army and its leaders, and in <a href="/isaiah/60-13.htm">Isaiah 60:13</a> is a symbol of the great men of the earth generally; whilst in the verse before us, the allusion to the Israelitish land and nation is neither indicated, nor even favoured, by the context of the words. Apart, for example, from the fact that such a thought as this, "the wickedness committed upon the holy land will cover thee, because of the wickedness committed upon the earth," not only appears lame, but would be very difficult to sustain on biblical grounds, inasmuch as the wickedness committed upon the earth and its inhabitants would be declared to be a greater crime than that committed upon the land and people of the Lord; this view does not answer to the train of thought in the whole of the ode, since the previous strophes do not contain any special allusion to the devastation of the holy land, or the subjugation and ill-treatment of the holy people, but simply to the plundering of many nations, and the gain forced out of their sweat and blood, as being the great crime of the Chaldaean (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-8.htm">Habakkuk 2:8</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-10.htm">Habakkuk 2:10</a>, <a href="/habakkuk/2-13.htm">Habakkuk 2:13</a>), for which he would be visited with retribution and destruction. Consequently we must take the words literally, as referring to the wickedness practised by the Chaldaean upon nature and the animal world, as the glorious creation of God, represented by the cedars and cypresses of Lebanon, and the animals living in the forests upon those mountains. Not satisfied with robbing men and nations, and with oppressing and ill-treating them, the Chaldaean committed wickedness upon the cedars and cypresses also, and the wild animals of Lebanon, cutting down the wood either for military purposes or for state buildings, so that the wild animals were unsparingly exterminated. There is a parallel to this in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/14-8.htm">Isaiah 14:8</a>, where the cypresses and cedars of Lebanon rejoice at the fall of the Chaldaean, because they will be no more hewn down. Sho&#772;d behe&#772;mo&#772;th, devastation upon (among) the animals (with the gen. obj., as in <a href="/isaiah/22-4.htm">Isaiah 22:4</a> and <a href="/psalms/12-6.htm">Psalm 12:6</a>). &#1497;&#1495;&#1497;&#1514;&#1503; is a relative clause, and the subject, sho&#772;d, the devastation which terrified the animals. The form &#1497;&#1495;&#1497;&#1514;&#1503; for &#1497;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503;, from &#1497;&#1495;&#1514;, hiphil of &#1495;&#1514;&#1514;, is anomalous, the syllable with dagesh being resolved into an extended one, like &#1492;&#1514;&#1497;&#1502;&#1498; for &#1492;&#1514;&#1502;&#1468;&#1498; in <a href="/isaiah/33-1.htm">Isaiah 33:1</a>; and the tsere of the final syllable is exchanged for pathach because of the pause, as, for example, in &#1492;&#1514;&#1506;&#1500;&#1468;&#1501; in <a href="/psalms/55-2.htm">Psalm 55:2</a> (see Olshausen, Gramm. p. 576). There is no necessity to alter it into &#1497;&#1495;&#1497;&#1514;&#1498; (Ewald and Olshausen after the lxx, Syr., and Vulg.), and it only weakens the idea of the talio. The second hemistich is repeated as a refrain from <a href="/habakkuk/2-8.htm">Habakkuk 2:8</a>. </body></html>
