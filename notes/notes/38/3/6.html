The Lord will cause the sins of the believer to pass away by his sanctifying grace, and will enable him to walk in newness of life. As the promises made to David often pass into promises of the Messiah, so the promises to Joshua look forward to Christ, of whose priesthood Joshua's was a shadow. Whatever trials we pass through, whatever services we perform, our whole dependence must rest on Christ, the Branch of righteousness. He is God's servant, employed in his work, obedient to his will, devoted to his honour and glory. He is the Branch from which all our fruit must be gathered. The eye of his Father was upon him, especially in his sufferings, and when he was buried in the grave, as the foundation-stones are under ground, out of men's sight. But the prophecy rather denotes the attention paid to this precious Corner-stone. All believers, from the beginning, had looked forward to it in the types and predictions. All believers, after Christ's coming, would look to it with faith, hope, and love. Christ shall appear for all his chosen, as the high priest when before the Lord, with the names of all Israel graven in the precious stones of his breastplate. When God gave a remnant to Christ, to be brought through grace to glory, then he engraved this precious stone. By him sin shall be taken away, both the guilt and the dominion of it; he did it in one day, that day in which he suffered and died. What should terrify when sin is taken away? Then nothing can hurt, and we sit down under Christ's shadow with delight, and are sheltered by it. And gospel grace, coming with power, makes men forward to draw others to it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/zechariah/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the angel of the Lord protested - Solemnly (etymologically, called God to witness) as in, "Did I not make thee swear by the Lord and protested unto thee" <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/2-42.htm">1 Kings 2:42</a>, laying it as an obligation upon him.

The contents are called tephilla&#770;h, a prayer, like <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/17-1.htm">Psalm 17:1-15</a>; 86; 90; 102, and <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/142-1.htm">Psalm 142:1-7</a>, not merely with reference to the fact that it commences with a prayer to God, but because that prayer announces the contents of the ode after the manner of a theme, and the whole of the ode is simply the lyrical unfolding of that prayer. In order, however, to point at the same time to the prophetic character of the prayer, that it may not be regarded as a lyrical effusion of the subjective emotions, wishes, and hopes of a member of the congregation, but may be recognised as a production of the prophets, enlightened by the Spirit of Jehovah, the name of the author is given with the predicate "the prophet;" and to this there is added &#1506;&#1500; &#1513;&#1473;&#1490;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;, to indicate the poetico-subjective character, through which it is distinguished from prophecy in the narrower sense. The expression "upon Shigionoth" cannot refer to the contents or the object of the ode; for although shigga&#770;yo&#772;n, according to its etymon sha&#770;ga&#770;h  equals  sha&#770;gag, to transgress by mistake, to sin, might have the meaning transgression in a moral sense, and consequently might be referred to the sins of transgressors, either of the Judaeans or the Chaldaeans, such an assumption is opposed both to the use of shigga&#770;yo&#772;n in the heading to <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/7.htm">Psalm 7</a>, and also to the analogy between &#8219;al shigyo&#772;no&#772;th, and such headings to the psalms as &#8219;al haggitt&#305;&#772;th, &#8219;al neg&#305;&#772;no&#772;th, and other words introduced with &#8219;al. Whilst shigga&#770;yo&#772;n in <a href="/psalms/7-1.htm">Psalm 7:1</a> indicates the style of poetry in which the psalm is composed, all the notices in the headings to the psalms that are introduced with &#8219;al refer either to the melody or style in which the psalms are to be sung, or to the musical accompaniment with which they are to be introduced into the worship of God. This musico-liturgical signification is to be retained here also, since it is evident from the subscription in <a href="//biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-19.htm">Habakkuk 3:19</a>, and the repetition of Selah three times (<a href="//biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-3.htm">Habakkuk 3:3</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-9.htm">Habakkuk 3:9</a>, <a href="/habakkuk/3-13.htm">Habakkuk 3:13</a>), that our hymn was to be used with musical accompaniment. Now, as sha&#770;ga&#770;h, to err, then to reel to and fro, is applied to the giddiness both of intoxication and of love (<a href="/isaiah/28-7.htm">Isaiah 28:7</a>; <a href="/proverbs/20-1.htm">Proverbs 20:1</a>; <a href="/proverbs/5-20.htm">Proverbs 5:20</a>), shigga&#770;yo&#772;n signifies reeling, and in the terminology of poetry a reeling song, i.e., a song delivered in the greatest excitement, or with a rapid change of emotion, dithyrambus (see Clauss on <a href="/psalms/7-1.htm">Psalm 7:1</a>; Ewald, Delitzsch, and others); hence &#1506;&#1500; &#1513;&#1473;&#1490;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;, after dithyrambs, or "after the manner of a stormy, martial, and triumphal ode" (Schmieder). </body></html>
