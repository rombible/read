Guilt and corruption are great discouragements when we stand before God. By the guilt of the sins committed by us, we are liable to the justice of God; by the power of sin that dwells in us, we are hateful to the holiness of God. Even God's Israel are in danger on these accounts; but they have relief from Jesus Christ, who is made of God to us both righteousness and sanctification. Joshua, the high priest, is accused as a criminal, but is justified. When we stand before God, to minister to him, or stand up for God, we must expect to meet all the resistance Satan's subtlety and malice can give. Satan is checked by one that has conquered him, and many times silenced him. Those who belong to Christ, will find him ready to appear for them, when Satan appears most strongly against them. A converted soul is a brand plucked out of the fire by a miracle of free grace, therefore shall not be left a prey to Satan. Joshua appears as one polluted, but is purified; he represents the Israel of God, who are all as an unclean thing, till they are washed and sanctified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God. Israel now were free from idolatry, but there were many things amiss in them. There were spiritual enemies warring against them, more dangerous than any neighbouring nations. Christ loathed the filthiness of Joshua's garments, yet did not put him away. Thus God by his grace does with those whom he chooses to be priests to himself. The guilt of sin is taken away by pardoning mercy, and the power of it is broken by renewing grace. Thus Christ washes those from their sins in his own blood, whom he makes kings and priests to our God. Those whom Christ makes spiritual priests, are clothed with the spotless robe of his righteousness, and appear before God in that; and with the graces of his Spirit, which are ornaments to them. The righteousness of saints, both imputed and implanted, is the fine linen, clean and white, with which the bride, the Lamb's wife, is arrayed, Re 19:8. Joshua is restored to former honours and trusts. The crown of the priesthood is put on him. When the Lord designs to restore and revive religion, he stirs up prophets and people to pray for it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/zechariah/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments - Such, it is expressed, was his habitual condition; he was one so clothed. The "filthy garment," as defilement generally, is, in Scripture, the symbol of sin. "We are all as the unclean, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags" <a href="/isaiah/64-6.htm">Isaiah 64:6</a>. "He that is left in Zion and he that remaineth in Jerusalem shall be called holy - when the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion" <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/4-3.htm">Isaiah 4:3-4</a>. "There is a generation, pure in its own eyes, and it is not washed from its filthiness" <a href="/proverbs/30-12.htm">Proverbs 30:12</a>. The same is expressed by different words, signifying pollution, defilement by sin; "Woe unto her that is filthy and polluted" <a href="/zephaniah/3-1.htm">Zephaniah 3:1</a>; "The land was defiled with blood" <a href="/psalms/106-38.htm">Psalm 106:38</a>; "they were defiled with their own works". It is symbolized also by the "divers washings" <a href="/hebrews/9-10.htm">Hebrews 9:10</a> of the law, representing restored purity; and the use of the word by Psalmists and prophets; "Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity" <a href="/psalms/51-4.htm">Psalm 51:4</a>; "wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before Mine eyes" <a href="/isaiah/1-16.htm">Isaiah 1:16</a>; "O Jerusalem, wash thy heart from wickedness" <a href="/jeremiah/4-14.htm">Jeremiah 4:14</a>.

Here primarily the "filthy garments" represent the abject state temporally of the priesthood and people at the return from Babylon. Yet he "stood before the angel."

Having fallen into sin. The Jewish writers (z) interpret this of the sin of his children in marrying strange wives, <a href="/ezra/10-18.htm">Ezra 10:18</a> or he had married one himself, as Jerom from the Jews, on the place; or a whore, as Justin Martyr (a) suggests; or had been slothful and sluggish in rebuilding the temple; and, be it what it will, Satan had aggravated it, and represented him as a most filthy creature, covered with sin, and as it were clothed with it: sins may well be called filthy garments, since righteousnesses are as filthy rags, <a href="/isaiah/64-6.htm">Isaiah 64:6</a>. It may also denote the imperfection of the Levitical priesthood, and the pollutions in it, at least in those who officiated therein, and especially under the second temple; as well as may represent the defilements of the Lord's people by sins they fall into: <p>and stood before the angel: as an accused person, charged with sin, and waiting the issue of the process against him: he stood under an humble sense of his iniquities, looking to the blood and righteousness of Christ for pardon and justification; praying and entreating that these filthy garments might be took away from him, and he be clothed with fine linen, suitable to his character as a priest. Such a sordid dress was the habit of persons arraigned for crimes. It was usual, especially among the Romans, when a man was accused of, and charged with, capital crimes, and during his arraignment, to let down his hair, suffer his beard to grow long, to wear filthy ragged garments, and appear in a very dirty and sordid habit; hence such were called "sordidati" (b): nay, it was not only customary for the accused person, when he was brought into court before the people to be tried, to be in such a filthy dress; but even his near relations, friends, and acquaintance, before the court went to voting, used to appear in like manner, with their hair dishevelled, and clothed with garments foul and out of fashion, weeping and crying, and deprecating punishment; thinking, by such a filthy and deformed habit, to move the pity of the people (c). It is said of the ambassadors of the Rhodians at Rome, upon a certain victory obtained, that they appeared at first in white garments, suitable to a congratulation; but when they were told that the Rhodians had not so well deserved to be reckoned among the friends and allies of the Romans, they immediately put on sordid garments, and went about to the houses of the principal men, with prayers and tears entreating that cognizance might first be taken of their cause, before they were condemned (d): though, on the contrary, some, when arraigned, as defying their accusers, and as a token of their innocence, and to show the fortitude of their minds, and even, if they could, to terrify the court itself, would dress out in the most splendid manner; or, however, would not follow the above custom. It is reported of Scipio Africanus, that when he was arraigned in court, he would not omit shaving his beard, nor put off his white garments, nor appear in the common dress of arraigned persons (e): and when Manlius Capitolinus was arraigned in court, none of his relations would change their clothes; and Appius Claudius, when he was tried by the tribunes of the common people, behaved with such spirit, and put on such a bold countenance, as thinking that by his ferocity he might strike terror into the tribunes; and so Herod, when he was accused before Hyrcanus, went into the court clothed in purple, and attended with a guard of armed men (f): whether the above custom obtained in Judea, and so early as the times of this prophet, is not so evident; though Josephus ben Gorion says it was a custom for a guilty person to stand before the judges clothed in black, and his head covered with dust (g); however, it is certain that with the Jews a distinction was made in the dress of priests, who, by the sanhedrim, were found guilty or not; such as were, were clothed and veiled in "black"; and such as were not, but were found right and perfect, were clothed in white; and went in, and ministered with their brethren the priests (h). <p>(z) T.

But the sin was not only personal; he appeared laden with the guilt of the priesthood and his people. He is a type of Christ in this. Christ, indeed, was without sin; yet he bare our sins in his own body on the tree, and was made sin for us (<a href="/romans/8-3.htm">Romans 8:3</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>). Some consider that the soiled garments denote the mean address in which an accused person appeared in court. But this is to import a Roman custom (comp. Livy, 2:54; 6:20) into Hebrew practice. Others deem it incongruous to make a high priest violate the decency of his office by officiating in unclean apparel. But the violation of propriety was a requirement of the vision, that thus the defilement of sin might be symbolical. <span class="cmt_word">He stood before the angel.</span> To ask his aid and protection (ver. 4). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/habakkuk/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Fifth and last strophe. - <a href="/habakkuk/2-18.htm">Habakkuk 2:18</a>. "What profiteth the graven image, that the maker thereof hath carved it; the molten image and the teacher of lies, that the maker of his image trusteth in him to make dumb idols? <a href="/habakkuk/2-19.htm">Habakkuk 2:19</a>. Woe to him that saith to the wood, Wake up; Awake, to the hard stone. Should it teach? Behold, it is encased in gold and silver, and there is nothing of breath in its inside. <a href="/habakkuk/2-20.htm">Habakkuk 2:20</a>. But Jehovah is in His holy temple: let all the world be silent before Him." This concluding strophe does not commence, like the preceding ones, with ho&#772;i, but with the thought which prepares the way for the woe, and is attached to what goes before to strengthen the threat, all hope of help being cut off from the Chaldaean. Like all the rest of the heathen, the Chaldaean also trusted in the power of his gods. This confidence the prophet overthrows in <a href="/habakkuk/2-18.htm">Habakkuk 2:18</a> : "What use is it?" equivalent to "The idol is of no use" (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/2-11.htm">Jeremiah 2:11</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9-10</a>). The force of this question still continues in masse&#772;kha&#770;h: "Of what use is the molten image?" Pesel is an image carved out of wood or stone; masse&#772;kha&#770;h an image cast in metal. &#1492;&#1493;&#1506;&#1497;&#1500; is the perfect, expressing a truth founded upon experience, as a fact: What profit has it ever brought? Mo&#772;reh sheqer (the teacher of lies) is not the priest or prophet of the idols, after the analogy of <a href="/micah/3-11.htm">Micah 3:11</a> and <a href="/isaiah/9-14.htm">Isaiah 9:14</a>; for that would not suit the following explanatory clause, in which &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; (in him) points back to mo&#772;reh sheqer: "that the maker of idols trusteth in him (the teacher of lies)." Consequently the mo&#772;reh sheqer must be the idol itself; and it is so designated in contrast with the true God, the teacher in the highest sense (cf. <a href="/job/36-22.htm">Job 36:22</a>). The idol is a teacher of lying, inasmuch as it sustains the delusion, partly by itself and partly through its priests, that it is God, and can do what men expect from God; whereas it is nothing more than a dumb nonentity ('el&#305;&#772;l 'ille&#772;m: compare &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;, <a href="/1_corinthians/12-2.htm">1 Corinthians 12:2</a>). Therefore woe be to him who expects help from such lifeless wood or image of stone. &#1506;&#1509; is the block of wood shaped into an idol. Ha&#770;q&#305;&#772;tsa&#770;h, awake! sc. to my help, as men pray to the living God (<a href="/psalms/35-23.htm">Psalm 35:23</a>; <a href="/psalms/44-24.htm">Psalm 44:24</a>; <a href="/psalms/59-6.htm">Psalm 59:6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/51-9.htm">Isaiah 51:9</a>). &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; &#1497;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492; is a question of astonishment at such a delusion. This is required by the following sentence: it is even encased in gold. Ta&#770;phas: generally to grasp; here to set in gold, to encase in gold plate (za&#770;ha&#770;bh is an accusative). &#1499;&#1468;&#1500; &#1488;&#1497;&#1503;: there is not at all. &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;, breath, the spirit of life (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/10-14.htm">Jeremiah 10:14</a>). <a href="/habakkuk/2-18.htm">Habakkuk 2:18</a> and <a href="/habakkuk/2-19.htm">Habakkuk 2:19</a> contain a concise summary of the reproaches heaped upon idolatry in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9-20</a>; but they are formed quite independently, without any evident allusions to that passage. In <a href="/habakkuk/2-20.htm">Habakkuk 2:20</a> the contrast is drawn between the dumb lifeless idols and the living God, who is enthroned in His holy temple, i.e., not the earthly temple at Jerusalem, but the heavenly temple, or the temple as the throne of the divine glory (<a href="/isaiah/66-1.htm">Isaiah 66:1</a>), as in <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/1-2.htm">Micah 1:2</a>, whence God will appear to judge the world, and to manifest His holiness upon the earth, by the destruction of the earthly powers that rise up against Him. This thought is implied in the words, "He is in His holy temple," inasmuch as the holy temple is the palace in which He is enthroned as Lord and Ruler of the whole world, and from which He observes the conduct of men (<a href="/psalms/11-4.htm">Psalm 11:4</a>). Therefore the whole earth, i.e., all the population of the earth, is to be still before Him, i.e., to submit silently to Him, and wait for His judgment. Compare <a href="/zephaniah/1-7.htm">Zephaniah 1:7</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/2-13.htm">Zechariah 2:13</a>, where the same command is borrowed from this passage, and referred to the expectation of judgment. &#1495;&#1505; is hardly an imper. apoc. of &#1492;&#1505;&#1492;, but an interjection, from which the verb ha&#770;sa&#770;h is formed. But if the whole earth must keep silence when He appears as Judge, it is all over with the Chaldaean also, with all his glory and might. </body></html>
