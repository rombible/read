And we repose ourselves in sweet tranquillity under his protection and care, being saved from the fear of evil, and possessed of a peace that passeth all understanding. “This may perhaps have a special reference to that day when the eyes of the Jews shall be fixed upon Christ, the precious corner stone, which they have hitherto rejected. Then their load of national guilt shall at once be removed; and they shall enjoy spiritual peace and temporal security in their own land, as in the days of Solomon.” — Scott. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/zechariah/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:6-10 All whom God calls to any office he finds fit, or makes so. The Lord will cause the sins of the believer to pass away by his sanctifying grace, and will enable him to walk in newness of life. As the promises made to David often pass into promises of the Messiah, so the promises to Joshua look forward to Christ, of whose priesthood Joshua's was a shadow. Whatever trials we pass through, whatever services we perform, our whole dependence must rest on Christ, the Branch of righteousness. He is God's servant, employed in his work, obedient to his will, devoted to his honour and glory. He is the Branch from which all our fruit must be gathered. The eye of his Father was upon him, especially in his sufferings, and when he was buried in the grave, as the foundation-stones are under ground, out of men's sight. But the prophecy rather denotes the attention paid to this precious Corner-stone. All believers, from the beginning, had looked forward to it in the types and predictions. All believers, after Christ's coming, would look to it with faith, hope, and love. Christ shall appear for all his chosen, as the high priest when before the Lord, with the names of all Israel graven in the precious stones of his breastplate. When God gave a remnant to Christ, to be brought through grace to glory, then he engraved this precious stone. By him sin shall be taken away, both the guilt and the dominion of it; he did it in one day, that day in which he suffered and died. What should terrify when sin is taken away? Then nothing can hurt, and we sit down under Christ's shadow with delight, and are sheltered by it. And gospel grace, coming with power, makes men forward to draw others to it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/zechariah/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Under the vine and under the fig tree - Micah had already made the description of the peaceful days of Solomon <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/4-25.htm">1 Kings 4:25</a>, a symbol <a href="/micah/4-4.htm">Micah 4:4</a> of the universal fearless peace of the time of Christ.

Like this light, or like the rising sun, when the Lord comes, there arises (spreads) a brilliant light, from which the rays emanate on its two sides. &#1511;&#1512;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, according to &#1511;&#1512;&#1503; in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/34-29.htm">Exodus 34:29-30</a>, is to be taken in the sense of rays; and this meaning has developed itself from a comparison of the first rays of the rising sun, which shoot out above the horizon, to the horns or antlers of the gazelle, which is met with in the Arabian poets. &#1502;&#1497;&#1468;&#1491;&#1493;, from His hand, i.e., since the hand is by the side, "at His side" (after the analogy of &#1502;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493; and &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1502;&#1488;&#1500;&#1493;), and indeed "His hand" in a general sense, as signifying the hand generally, and not one single hand, equivalent therefore to "on both sides" (Delitzsch). As the disc of the sun is surrounded by a splendid radiance, so the coming of God is enclosed by rays on both sides. &#1500;&#1493; refers to God. "Such a radiant splendour (&#1511;&#1512;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;) surrounding God is presupposed when it is affirmed of Moses, that on coming from the presence of Jehovah his face was radiant, or emitted rays" (&#1511;&#1512;&#1503;, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/34-29.htm">Exodus 34:29-30</a>). This interpretation of the words is established beyond all doubt, not only by the &#1502;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493; of the original passage in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-2.htm">Deuteronomy 33:2</a>, but also by the expressions which follow in <a href="//biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-5.htm">Habakkuk 3:5</a>, viz., &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493; (before him) and &#1500;&#1512;&#1490;&#1500;&#1493;&#1497;&#1493; (behind him); and consequently the interpretation "rays (emanating) from His hand are to Him," with the idea that we are to think of flashes of lightning darting out of God's hand (Schnur., Ros., Hitzig, Maurer, etc.), is proved to be untenable. According to Hebrew notions, flashes of lightning do not proceed from the hand of God (in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/18-9.htm">Psalm 18:9</a>, which has been appealed to in support of this explanation, we have &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;); and &#1511;&#1512;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; does not occur either in Arabic or the later Hebrew in the sense of flashes of lightning, but only in the sense of the sun's rays. &#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501; &#1495;&#1489;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503; &#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1492;, and there - namely, in the sun-like splendour, with the rays emanating from it - is the hiding of His omnipotence, i.e., the place where His omnipotence hides itself; in actual fact, the splendour forms the covering of the Almighty God at His coming, the manifestation of the essentially invisible God. The cloudy darkness is generally represented as the covering of the glory of God (<a href="/exodus/20-21.htm">Exodus 20:21</a>; <a href="/1_kings/8-12.htm">1 Kings 8:12</a>), not merely when His coming is depicted under the earthly substratum of a storm (<a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/18-12.htm">Psalm 18:12-13</a>), but also when God was manifested in the pillar of cloud and fire (<a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21</a>) on the journey of the Israelites through the desert, where it was only by night that the cloud had the appearance of fire (<a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/9-15.htm">Numbers 9:15-16</a>). Here, on the contrary, the idea of the splendour of the rising sun predominates, according to which light is the garment in which God clothes Himself (<a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/104-2.htm">Psalm 104:2</a>, cf. <a href="/1_timothy/6-16.htm">1 Timothy 6:16</a>), answering to His coming as the Holy One (<a href="/habakkuk/3-3.htm">Habakkuk 3:3</a>). For the sun-light, in its self-illumining splendour, is the most suitable earthly element to serve as a symbol of the spotless purity of the Holy One, in whom there is no variation of light and darkness (<a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>; see at <a href="/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>). The alteration of &#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501; into &#1493;&#1513;&#1474;&#1501; (he provides or contrives the concealment of His power), which Hitzig proposes after the lxx (Aq., Symm., and Syr.), must be rejected, inasmuch as in that case the object, which he makes into the covering (cf. <a href="/psalms/18-12.htm">Psalm 18:12</a>), could not be omitted; and this thought is by no means suitable here, and has merely been brought into the text on the assumption that God appears in a storm. As the Holy One, God comes to judgment upon the unholy world (<a href="/habakkuk/3-5.htm">Habakkuk 3:5</a>). Before Him goes debher, plague, and after His feet, i.e., behind Him, resheph, lit., burning heat, or a blaze (Sol 8:6), here the burning heat of the pestilence, fever-heat, as in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-24.htm">Deuteronomy 32:24</a>. Plague and pestilence, as proceeding from God, are personified and represented as satellites; the former going before Him, as it were, as a shield-bearer (<a href="/1_samuel/17-7.htm">1 Samuel 17:7</a>), or courier (<a href="/2_samuel/15-1.htm">2 Samuel 15:1</a>); the latter coming after Him as a servant (<a href="/1_samuel/25-42.htm">1 Samuel 25:42</a>). This verse prepares the way for the description, which commences with <a href="//biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-6.htm">Habakkuk 3:6</a>, of the impression produced by the coming of God upon the world and its inhabitants. </body></html>
