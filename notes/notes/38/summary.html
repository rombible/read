(See 1-2). Like the book of Job (Job 1-2) it offers a glimpse into the heavenlies where we view the confrontations between God and Satan (3:1-5).<p class="num"><span class="nm">2.</span> According to Genesis (Gen. 11:1-9), the land of Shinar (ancient Babylon) was Satan’s original headquarters. According to Zechariah (5:5-11), the land of Shinar will become Satan’s future headquarters.<p class="num"><span class="nm">3.</span> Jewish tradition says Zechariah was a member of the great synagogue that collected and preserved the Old Testament books. Jesus said (Mt. 23:35) he was murdered by his own wicked countrymen, just as an earlier Zechariah (a high priest had been murdered) (2 Chron. 24:20-21).<p class="num"><span class="nm">4.</span> His book is the longest of the minor prophets. It is the only biblical book referring to Canaan as the Holy Land (2:12). For its size, Zechariah is quoted from or alluded to more than any other Old Testament book.<p class="num"><span class="nm">5.</span> Zechariah’s writings resemble those of Daniel. Daniel was born in Palestine, but wrote his prophecies in Babylon. Zechariah was born in Babylon, but wrote his prophecies in Palestine.
