God notices the extent of his church, and will take care that whatever number of guests are brought to the wedding-supper, there shall be room. This vision means well to Jerusalem. The walls of a city, as they defend it, so they straiten its inhabitants; but Jerusalem shall be extended as freely as if it had no walls at all, yet shall be as safe as if it had the strongest walls. In the church of God there yet is room for other multitudes, more than man can number. None shall be refused who trust in Christ; and He never shuts out from heaven one true member of the church on earth. God will be a Wall of fire round them, which can neither be broken through nor undermined, nor can it be assailed without danger to those who attack. This vision was to have its full accomplishment in the gospel church, which is extended by admitting the Gentiles into it; and which has the Son of God for its Prince and Protector; especially in the glorious times yet to come.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/zechariah/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The angel that talked with me went forth - Probably to receive the explanation which was given him for Zechariah; and another angel, a higher angel, since he gives him a commission, "went forth to meet him," being (it seems probable) instructed by the Angel of the Lord, who laid down the future dimensions of the city. The indefiniteness of the description, another angel, implies that he was neither the Angel of the Lord, nor (were they different) Michael, or the man with the measuring line, but an angel of intermediate rank, instructed by one higher, instructing the lower, who immediately instructed Zechariah. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/zechariah/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. angel that talked with me &#8230; another angel&#8212;The interpreting angel is met by another angel sent by the measuring Divine Angel to "run" to Zechariah (Zec 2:4).

In the present instance it adds a new and important feature to what is stated in <a href="//biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-4.htm">Habakkuk 2:4</a>, "And add to this that wine is treacherous;" i.e., to those who are addicted to it, it does not bring strength and life, but leads to the way to ruin (for the thought itself, see <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/23-31.htm">Proverbs 23:31-32</a>). The application to the Chaldaean is evident from the context. The fact that the Babylonians were very much addicted to wine is attested by ancient writers. Curtius, for example (<a href="/habakkuk/2-1.htm">Habakkuk 2:1</a>), says, "Babylonii maxime in vinum et quae ebrietatem sequuntur effusi sunt;" and it is well known from <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/5.htm">Daniel 5</a> that Babylon was conquered while Belshazzar and the great men of his kingdom were feasting at a riotous banquet. The following words &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; &#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1512; are not the object to &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1490;&#1491;, but form a fresh sentence, parallel to the preceding one: a boasting man, he continueth not. &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; introduces the apodosis to &#1490;&#1489;&#1512; &#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1512;, which is written absolutely. &#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1512; only occurs again in <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/21-24.htm">Proverbs 21:24</a>, and is used there as a parallel to &#1494;&#1491;: &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bd; (lxx), swaggering, boasting. The allusion to the Chaldaean is evident from the relative clause which follows, and which Delitzsch very properly calls an individualizing exegesis to &#1490;&#1489;&#1512; &#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1512;. But looking to what follows, this sentence forms a protasis to <a href="//biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-6.htm">Habakkuk 2:6</a>, being written first in an absolute form, "He, the widely opened one, etc., upon him will all take up," etc. Hirch&#305;&#772;bh naphsho&#772;, to widen his soul, i.e., his desire, parallel to pa&#770;&#8219;ar peh, to open the mouth (<a href="/isaiah/5-14.htm">Isaiah 5:14</a>), is a figure used to denote insatiable desire. &#1499;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1500;, like Hades, which swallows up every living thing (see <a href="/proverbs/27-20.htm">Proverbs 27:20</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/30-15.htm">Proverbs 30:15-16</a>). The comparison to death has the same meaning. &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506; does not refer to &#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, but to the Chaldaean, who grasps to himself in an insatiable manner, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-6.htm">Habakkuk 1:6-7</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-15.htm">Habakkuk 1:15-17</a>. The imperff. consecc. express the continued gathering up of the nations, which springs out of his insatiable desire. </body></html>
