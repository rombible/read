God notices the extent of his church, and will take care that whatever number of guests are brought to the wedding-supper, there shall be room. This vision means well to Jerusalem. The walls of a city, as they defend it, so they straiten its inhabitants; but Jerusalem shall be extended as freely as if it had no walls at all, yet shall be as safe as if it had the strongest walls. In the church of God there yet is room for other multitudes, more than man can number. None shall be refused who trust in Christ; and He never shuts out from heaven one true member of the church on earth. God will be a Wall of fire round them, which can neither be broken through nor undermined, nor can it be assailed without danger to those who attack. This vision was to have its full accomplishment in the gospel church, which is extended by admitting the Gentiles into it; and which has the Son of God for its Prince and Protector; especially in the glorious times yet to come.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/zechariah/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A man with a measuring line in his hand - Probably the Angel of the Lord, of whom Ezekiel has a like vision.

"Behold, puffed up, his soul is not straight within him: but the just, through his faith will he live. <a href="/habakkuk/2-5.htm">Habakkuk 2:5</a>. And moreover, the wine is treacherous: a boasting man, he continues not; he who has opened his soul as wide as hell, and is like death, and is not satisfied, and gathered all nations to himself, and collected all peoples to himself." These verses, although they contain the fundamental thought, or so to speak the heading of the following announcement of the judgment upon the Chaldaeans, are nevertheless not to be regarded as the sum and substance of what the prophet was to write upon the tables. For they do indeed give one characteristic of two classes of men, with a brief intimation of the fate of both, but they contain no formally rounded thought, which could constitute the motto of the whole; on the contrary, the description of the insatiable greediness of the Chaldaean is attached in <a href="/habakkuk/2-5.htm">Habakkuk 2:5</a> to the picture of the haughty sinner, that the two cannot be separated. This picture is given in a subjective clause, which is only completed by the filling up in <a href="/habakkuk/2-6.htm">Habakkuk 2:6</a>. The sentence pronounced upon the Chaldaean in <a href="//biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-4.htm">Habakkuk 2:4</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-5.htm">Habakkuk 2:5</a>, simply forms the preparatory introduction to the real answer to the prophet's leading question. The subject is not mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-4.htm">Habakkuk 2:4</a>, but may be inferred from the prophet's question in <a href="//biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-12.htm">Habakkuk 1:12-17</a>. The Chaldaean is meant. His soul is puffed up. &#1506;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;, perf. pual of &#1506;&#1508;&#1500;, of which the hiphil only occurs in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/14-44.htm">Numbers 14:44</a>, and that as synonymous with &#1492;&#1494;&#1497;&#1491; in <a href="/deuteronomy/1-43.htm">Deuteronomy 1:43</a>. From this, as well as from the noun &#1506;&#1508;&#1500;, a hill or swelling, we get the meaning, to be swollen up, puffed up, proud; and in the hiphil, to act haughtily or presumptuously. The thought is explained and strengthened by &#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1492;, "his soul is not straight." &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, to be straight, without turning and trickery, i.e., to be upright. &#1489;&#1468;&#1493; does not belong to &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493; (his soul in him, equivalent to his inmost soul), but to the verbs of the sentence. The early translators and commentators have taken this hemistich differently. They divide it into protasis and apodosis, and take &#1506;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492; either as the predicate or as the subject. Luther also takes it in the latter sense: "He who is stiff-necked will have no rest in his soul." Burk renders it still more faithfully: ecce quae effert se, non recta est anima ejus in eo. In either case we must supply &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; after &#1506;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;. But such an ellipsis as this, in which not only the relative word, but also the noun supporting the relative clause, would be omitted, is unparalleled and inadmissible, if only because of the tautology which would arise from supplying nephesh. This also applies to the hypothetical view of &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; &#1506;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;, upon which the Septuagint rendering, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834; &#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#769; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;, is founded. Even with this view nephesh could not be omitted as the subject of the protasis, and &#1489;&#1468;&#1493; would have no noun to which to refer. This rendering is altogether nothing more than a conjecture, &#1506;&#1508;&#1500; being confounded with &#1506;&#1500;&#1507;, and &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493; altered into &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;. Nor is it proved to be correct, by the fact that the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews (<a href="/hebrews/10-38.htm">Hebrews 10:38</a>) makes use of the words of our verse, according to this rendering, to support his admonition is to stedfastness. For he does not introduce the verse as a quotation to prove his words, but simply clothes his own thoughts in these words of the Bible which floated before his mind, and in so doing transposes the two hemistichs, and thereby gives the words a meaning quite in accordance with the Scriptures, which can hardly be obtained from the Alexandrian version, since we have there to take the subject to &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; from the preceding &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, which gives no sense, whereas by transposing the clauses a very suitable subject can be supplied from &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;.<p>The following clause, &#1493;&#1510;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1511; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;, is attached adversatively, and in form is subordinate to the sentence in the first hemistich in this sense, "whilst, on the contrary, the righteous lives through his faith," notwithstanding the fact that it contains a very important thought, which intimates indirectly that pride and want of uprightness will bring destruction upon the Chaldaean. &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1514;&#1493; belongs to &#1497;&#1495;&#1497;&#1492;, not to &#1510;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1511;. The tiphchah under the word does not show that it belongs to tsadd&#305;&#772;q, but simply that it has the leading tone of the sentence, because it is placed with emphasis before the verb (Delitzsch). &#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; does not denote "an honourable character, or fidelity to conviction" (Hitzig), but (from 'a&#770;man, to be firm, to last) firmness (<a href="/exodus/17-12.htm">Exodus 17:12</a>); then, as an attribute of God, trustworthiness, unchangeable fidelity in the fulfilment of His promises (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-4.htm">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/33-4.htm">Psalm 33:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/89-34.htm">Psalm 89:34</a>); and, as a personal attribute of man, fidelity in word and deed (<a href="/jeremiah/7-28.htm">Jeremiah 7:28</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/9-2.htm">Jeremiah 9:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/37-3.htm">Psalm 37:3</a>); and, in his relation to God, firm attachment to God, an undisturbed confidence in the divine promises of grace, firma fiducia and fides, so that in 'e&#774;mu&#772;na&#770;h the primary meanings of ne'e&#774;ma&#770;n and he'e&#774;m&#305;&#772;n are combined. This is also apparent from the fact that Abraham is called ne'e&#774;ma&#770;n in <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-8.htm">Nehemiah 9:8</a>, with reference to the fact that it is affirmed of him in <a href="/genesis/15-6.htm">Genesis 15:6</a> that &#1492;&#1488;&#1502;&#1497;&#1503; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;, "he trusted, or believed, the Lord;" and still more indisputably from the passage before us, since it is impossible to mistake the reference in &#1510;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1511; &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1514;&#1493; &#1497;&#1495;&#1497;&#1492; to <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/15-6.htm">Genesis 15:6</a>, "he believed (he'e&#774;m&#305;&#772;n) in Jehovah, and He reckoned it to him litseda&#770;qa&#770;h." It is also indisputably evident from the context that our passage treats of the relation between man and God, since the words themselves speak of a waiting (chikka&#770;h) for the fulfilment of a promising oracle, which is to be preceded by a period of severe suffering. "What is more natural than that life or deliverance from destruction should be promised to that faith which adheres faithfully to God, holds fast by the word of promise, and confidently waits for its fulfilment in the midst of tribulation? It is not the sincerity, trustworthiness, or integrity of the righteous man, regarded as being virtues in themselves, which are in danger of being shaken and giving way in such times of tribulation, but, as we may see in the case of the prophet himself, his faith. To this, therefore, there is appended the great promise expressed in the one word &#1497;&#1495;&#1497;&#1492;" (Delitzsch). And in addition to this, 'e&#774;mu&#772;na&#770;h is opposed to the pride of the Chaldaean, to his exaltation of himself above God; and for that very reason it cannot denote integrity in itself, but simply some quality which has for its leading feature humble submission to God, that is to say, faith, or firm reliance upon God. The Jewish expositors, therefore, have unanimously retained this meaning here, and the lxx have rendered the word quite correctly &#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, although by changing the suffix, and giving &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c2; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; instead of &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; (or more properly &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;: Aquila and the other Greek versions), they have missed, or rather perverted, the sense. The deep meaning of these words has been first fully brought out by the Apostle Paul (<a href="/romans/1-17.htm">Romans 1:17</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-11.htm">Galatians 3:11</a> : see also <a href="/hebrews/10-38.htm">Hebrews 10:38</a>), who omits the erroneous &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; of the lxx, and makes the declaration &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2; &#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; the basis of the New Testament doctrine of justification by faith.</body></html>
