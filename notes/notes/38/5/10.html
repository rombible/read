This betokened the Jewish nation. They are filling the measure of their iniquity; and when it is full, they shall be delivered into the hands of those to whom God sold them for their sins. The woman sitting in the midst of the ephah represents the sinful church and nation of the Jews, in their latter and corrupt age. Guilt is upon the sinner as a weight of lead, to sink him to the lowest hell. This seems to mean the condemnation of the Jews, after they filled the measure of their iniquities by crucifying Christ and rejecting his gospel. Zechariah sees the ephah, with the woman thus pressed in it, carried away to some far country. This intimates that the Jews should be hurried out of their own land, and forced to dwell in far countries, as they had been in Babylon. There the ephah shall be firmly placed, and their sufferings shall continue far longer than in their late captivity. Blindness is happened unto Israel, and they are settled upon their own unbelief. Let sinners fear to treasure up wrath against the day of wrath; for the more they multiply crimes, the faster the measure fills.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/zechariah/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>There came out two women - It may be that there may be no symbol herein, but that he names women because it was a woman who was so carried; yet their wings were the wings of an unclean bird, strong, powerful, borne by a force not their own; with their will, since they flew; beyond their will, since the wind was in their wings; rapidly, inexorably, irresistibly, they flew and bore the Ephah between heaven and earth. No earthly power could reach or rescue it. God would not. It may be that evil spirits are symbolized, as being like to this personified human wickedness, such as snatch away the souls of the damned, who, by serving them, have become as they. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/zechariah/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. The agents to carry away the "woman" are, consistently with the image, "women." God makes the wicked themselves the agents of punishing and removing wickedness. "Two" are employed, as one is not enough to carry such a load [Maurer]. Or, the Assyrians and Babylonians, who carried away idolatry in the persons, respectively, of Israel and Judah [Henderson]. As two "anointed ones" (Zec 4:14) stand by the Lord as His ministers, so two winged women execute His purpose here in removing the embodiment of "wickedness": answering to the "mystery of iniquity" (the Septuagint here in Zechariah uses the same words as Paul and "the man of sin," whom the Lord shall destroy with the spirit of His mouth and the brightness of His coming, 2Th 2:3, 7, 8). Their "wings" express velocity. The "stork" has long and wide wings, for which reason it is specified; also it is a migratory bird. The "wind" helps the rapid motion of the wings. The being "lifted up between heaven and earth" implies open execution of the judgment before the eyes of all. As the "woman" here is removed to Babylon as her own dwelling, so the woman in the Apocalypse of St. John is Babylon (Re 17:3-5).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/zechariah/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Then, </span> when I saw the ephah, woman imprisoned, and lead too, on the wings of those two women in motion, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">said I, Zechariah, Whither, </span> to what place, and how far, do these bear the ephah? not as a nurse carrieth the child, but as criminals are carried to punishment. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/zechariah/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then said I to the angel that talked with me;....

"And it will come to pass in that day, is the saying of Jehovah, voice of the cry from the fish-gate, and howling from the lower city, and great destruction from the hills. <a href="/zephaniah/1-11.htm">Zephaniah 1:11</a>. Howl, inhabitants of the mortar, for all the people of Canaan are destroyed; cut off are all that are laden with silver." In order to express the thought that the judgment will not spare any one class of the population, Zephaniah depicts the lamentation which will arise from all parts of the city. &#1511;&#1493;&#1500; &#1510;&#1506;&#1511;&#1492;, voice of the cry, i.e., a loud cry of anguish will arise or resound. The fish-gate (according to <a href="/nehemiah/3-3.htm">Nehemiah 3:3</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/12-39.htm">Nehemiah 12:39</a>; cf. <a href="/2_chronicles/33-14.htm">2 Chronicles 33:14</a>) was in the eastern portion of the wall which bounded the lower city on the north side (for further details on this point, see at <a href="/nehemiah/3-3.htm">Nehemiah 3:3</a>). &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492; ( equals  &#1492;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512; &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492;, <a href="/nehemiah/11-9.htm">Nehemiah 11:9</a>), the second part or district of the city, is the lower city upon the hill Acra (see at <a href="/2_kings/22-14.htm">2 Kings 22:14</a>). Shebher, fragor, does not mean a cry of murder, but the breaking to pieces of what now exists, not merely the crashing fall of the buildings, like za&#8219;a&#774;qath shebher in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/15-5.htm">Isaiah 15:5</a>, the cry uttered at the threatening danger of utter destruction. In order to heighten the terrors of the judgment, there is added to the crying and howling of the men the tumult caused by the conquest of the city. "From the hills," i.e., "not from Zion and Moriah," but from the ills surrounding the lower city, viz., Bezetha, Gareb (<a href="/jeremiah/31-39.htm">Jeremiah 31:39</a>), and others. For Zion, the citadel of Jerusalem, is evidently thought of as the place where the howling of the men and the noise of the devastation, caused by the enemy pressing in from the north and north-west, are heard. Hammakhte&#772;sh, the mortar (<a href="/proverbs/27-22.htm">Proverbs 27:22</a>), which is the name given in <a href="/judges/15-19.htm">Judges 15:19</a> to a hollow place in a rock, is used here to denote a locality in Jerusalem, most probably the depression which ran down between Acra on the west and Bezetha and Moriah on the east, as far as the fountain of Siloah, and is called by Josephus "the cheese-maker's valley," and by the present inhabitants el-Wa&#770;d, i.e., the valley, and also the mill-valley. The name "mortar" was probably coined by Zephaniah, to point to the fate of the merchants and men of money who lived there. They who dwell there shall howl, because "all the people of Canaan" are destroyed. These are not Canaanitish or Phoenician merchants, but Judaean merchants, who resembled the Canaanites or Phoenicians in their general business (see at <a href="/hosea/12-8.htm">Hosea 12:8</a>), and had grown rich through trade and usury. Net&#305;&#772;l keseph, laden with silver. </body></html>
