<span class="ital">there shall be a great mourning in Jerusalem — </span>A mourning expressed by the greatest the Jews ever experienced, the mourning for Josiah slain in Hadadrimmon, a town in the valley of <span class="ital">Megiddon. </span>There the lamentations for that good prince began, and were continued for many days from thence to Jerusalem, whither his body was carried to be interred in the sepulchre of his fathers; and there all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for him, and appointed the day to be annually observed with lamentations: so that from thenceforward the mourning for Josiah became a proverb for an extraordinary lamentation. <span class="ital">And the land shall mourn, every family apart — </span>The whole land shall mourn in a most solemn manner: and every family shall sequester themselves from business and conversation for that purpose. <span class="ital">The house of David apart, and their wives apart — </span>Those of the royal family, who have rejected Christ, shall lead the way. Even husbands and wives shall abstain from each others company, as was usual in times of solemn humiliation. Or, as some learned men suggest, in solemn processions, it was usual for the several orders of men to go distinctly, and likewise for the women to go in ranks by themselves, each tribe, or order of men and women, using a distinct form of lamentation, and expressing their sorrow in different words. This was probably done in the mourning for Josiah, and observed in the times after the return from captivity: see <a href="/2_chronicles/35-25.htm" title="And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah: and all the singing men and the singing women spoke of Josiah in their lamentations to this day, and made them an ordinance in Israel: and, behold, they are written in the lamentations.">2 Chronicles 35:25</a>, to which ceremonies the expressions of text may allude. <span class="ital">The family of Nathan apart — </span>David had a son named Nathan, <a href="/2_samuel/5-14.htm" title="And these be the names of those that were born to him in Jerusalem; Shammuah, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,">2 Samuel 5:14</a>. This branch of the royal family seems to be here meant, as that by Solomon is implied in the preceding clause. “It is possible,” says Newcome, “that at the final restoration of the Jews, the genealogies of some tribes may be found to have been preserved; and that the family of David may be traced up to more than one of its collateral branches; each of which, on account of its distinguished eminence, is to mourn apart.” <span class="ital">The house of Levi apart — </span>If the tribe of Levi be intended, it may be observed, the sacerdotal tribe were the most bitter persecutors of Christ; they hired the traitor, they sought witnesses; the high-priest, the head of that family, condemned him to die: for all which sins they shall one day be called upon to reckon with God, and therefore, above other tribes, are particularly named as chief mourners, for their injustice and cruelty to their Messiah. But probably a Levi, mentioned <a href="/luke/3-29.htm" title="Which was the son of Jose, which was the son of Eliezer, which was the son of Jorim, which was the son of Matthat, which was the son of Levi,">Luke 3:29</a>, is meant. <span class="ital">The family of Shimei apart — </span>For Shimei, the LXX., Arabic, and Syriac have <span class="ital">Simeon. </span>“As Nathan, Simeon, and Levi, are all reckoned among the progenitors of Christ, <a href="/context/luke/3-29.htm" title="Which was the son of Jose, which was the son of Eliezer, which was the son of Jorim, which was the son of Matthat, which was the son of Levi,...">Luke 3:29-31</a>, may not their families be mentioned by name as more particularly concerned in the guilt to be lamented? <span class="ital">For neither did his brethren believe in him, </span><a href="/john/7-5.htm" title="For neither did his brothers believe in him.">John 7:5</a>.” — Blayney. <span class="ital">All the families that remain, every family apart, and their wives apart — </span>Thus, after the mention of four particulars, he completes the induction by a general clause. As if he had said, It would be tedious to mention every family and their wives, though but once, therefore a general comprehensive account may suffice: some of every family, of the whole remnant of Israel, shall mourn, look to, believe in, and obey Christ. Thus the mourning of the Jews for their Messiah shall bear some proportion to their violence and cruelty against him; and they, through faith, shall live by the death of him whom they slew, and rise to glory by him whom they loaded with reproaches! What will not grace do, when it converts, accepts, comforts, and glorifies such offenders! <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/zechariah/12.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>12:9-14 The day here spoken of, is the day of Jerusalem's defence and deliverance, that glorious day when God will appear for the salvation of his people. In Christ's first coming he bruised the serpent's head, and broke all the powers of darkness that fought against God's kingdom among men. In his second coming he will complete their destruction, when he shall put down all opposing rule, principality, and power; and death itself shall be swallowed up in that victory. The Holy Spirit is gracious and merciful, and is the Author of all grace or holiness. He, also, is the Spirit of supplications, and shows men their ignorance, want, guilt, misery, and danger. At the time here foretold, the Jews will know who the crucified Jesus was; then they shall look by faith to him, and mourn with the deepest sorrow, not only in public, but in private, even each one separately. There is a holy mourning, the effect of the pouring out of the Spirit; a mourning for sin, which quickens faith in Christ, and qualifies for joy in God. This mourning is a fruit of the Spirit of grace, a proof of a work of grace in the soul, and of the Spirit of supplications. It is fulfilled in all who sorrow for sin after a godly sort; they look to Christ crucified, and mourn for him. Looking by faith upon the cross of Christ will cause us to mourn for sin after a godly sort.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/zechariah/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>As the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon - This was the greatest sorrow, which had fallen on Judah. Josiah was the last hope of its declining kingdom. His sons probably showed already their unlikeness to their father, whereby they precipitated their country's fall. in Josiah's death the last gleam of the sunset of Judah faded into night. Of him it is recorded, that "his pious acts, according to what was written in the law of the Lord," were written in his country's history <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-26.htm">2 Chronicles 35:26</a>, <a href="/2_chronicles/35-7.htm">2 Chronicles 35:7</a>; for him the prophet "Jeremiah wrote a dirge" <a href="/2_chronicles/35-25.htm">2 Chronicles 35:25</a>; "all" the minstrels of his country "spake of him in their dirges" <a href="/2_chronicles/35-25.htm">2 Chronicles 35:25</a>. The dirges were "made an ordinance" which survived the captivity; "to this day" <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-25.htm">2 Chronicles 35:25</a>, it is said at the close of the Chronicles. Among the gathering sorrows of Israel, this lament over Josiah was written in the national collection of "dirges" <a href="/2_chronicles/35-25.htm">2 Chronicles 35:25</a>. "Hadadrimmon," as being compounded of the name of two Syrian idols, is, in its name, a witness how Syrian idolatry penetrated into the kingdom, when it was detached from the worship of God. It was (Jerome) "a city near Jezreel, now called Maximinianopolis in the plain of Megiddon, in which the righteous king Josiah was wounded by Pharaoh Necho." This  "was 17 miles from Caesarea, 10 from Esdraelon." Its name still survives in a small village, south of Megiddon , and so, on the way back to Jerusalem. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/zechariah/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11.

Great numbers being awakened, convinced, and converted, and brought to true repentance: <p>as the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon. Lightfoot (i) thinks the prophet alludes to the two great and general lamentations of Israel; the one about the rock Rimmon, where a whole tribe was come to four hundred (it should be six hundred) men, <a href="/judges/20-47.htm">Judges 20:47</a> and may be rendered, "the sad shout of Rimmon"; and the other in the valley of Megiddo, for the death of Josiah. Some take Hadadrimmon to be the name of a man, as Aben Ezra; and the Targum and Jarchi say who he was, and also make two mournings to be alluded to (k); paraphrasing the words thus, <p>"at that time mourning shall be multiplied in Jerusalem, as the mourning of Ahab the son of Omri, whom Hadadrimmon the son of Tabrimmon slew in Ramothgilead; and as the mourning of Josiah, the son of Amon, whom Pharaohnecho, or the lame, slew in the valley of Megiddo:'' <p>and so the Syriac version renders it, <p>"as the mourning of the son of Amon in the valley of Megiddo.'' <p>Of the first of these, see <a href="/1_kings/22-31.htm">1 Kings 22:31</a> and of the latter, <a href="/2_kings/23-29.htm">2 Kings 23:29</a> according to Jerom, it was the name of a place in the valley of Megiddo, near to Jezreel; and which, in his time, went by the name of Maximianopolis, called so in honour of the Emperor Maximian; it was seventeen miles from Caesarea in Palestine, and ten miles from Jezreel (l); and mention is made by Jewish (m) writers of the valley of Rimmon, in which place the elders intercalated the year; though Jerom elsewhere (n) says, that Adadrimon was a king, the son of Tabrimmon, who reigned at Carchemish, whom Pharaohnecho slew at the same time he slew Josiah.

Both accounts of Josiah’s death state that it was “at,” or “in the valley of” Megiddo, that his wound was received (<a href="/2_kings/23-29.htm" title="In his days Pharaohnechoh king of Egypt went up against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates: and king Josiah went against him; and he slew him at Megiddo, when he had seen him.">2 Kings 23:29</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/35-22.htm" title="Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but disguised himself, that he might fight with him, and listened not to the words of Necho from the mouth of God, and came to fight in the valley of Megiddo.">2 Chronicles 35:22</a>), while the fuller account in the Book of Chronicles not only affirms the national character of the mourning for him at the time, “all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah,” but informs us that the prophet Jeremiah, probably in some dirge composed for the occasion, “lamented for him,” and that the anniversary of his death long continued to be observed as a day of national calamity. “All the singing men and the singing women spake of Josiah in their lamentations to this day, and (they) made them an ordinance in Israel; and behold they are written in the lamentations.” “The grief of the people at the fall of their brave and pious king at the age of thirty-nine years was extraordinarily deep. It seemed as though a gloomy foreboding would take possession of their minds that his fall really involved that of the realm itself, of which he had been the last great prop.

This universal and perennial mourning is a figure of the continual remembrance of the death of Christ in the Church. There is a difficulty about the identification of Hadadrimmon. St. Jerome says it was a place in the Plain of Megiddo, near Jezreel, and known in his day by the name of Maximianopolis. This is supposed to be <span class="accented">Rummaneh</span>, seven miles northwest of Jezreel, on the southern edge of the Plain of Esdraelon. But the identification is far from certain. The Assyrian name given to the place may, as Lowe suggests, be a confirmation of the post-exilian origin of the prophecy. The site of Megiddo also is undetermined, though Condor suggests <span class="accented">Mujedda</span>, a ruined city about three miles south of Bethshean. The opinion that the name Hadadrimmon is that of a Syrian or Phoenician god, whose rites were celebrated as those of Adonis ("the weeping for Tammuz" of <a href="/ezekiel/8-14.htm">Ezekiel 8:14</a>), is preposterous; and the idea that the prophet would thus refer to the worship of an abominable idol is one that could have occurred only to disbelievers in revelation.

"And I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and behold four horns. <a href="/zechariah/1-19.htm">Zechariah 1:19</a>. And I said to the angel that talked with me, What are these? And he said to me, These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem. <a href="/zechariah/1-20.htm">Zechariah 1:20</a>. And Jehovah showed me four smiths. <a href="/zechariah/1-21.htm">Zechariah 1:21</a>. And I said, What come these to do? And He spake to me thus: These are the horns which have scattered Judah, so that no one lifted up his head; these are now come to terrify them, to cast down the horns of the nations which have lifted up the horn against the land of Judah to scatter it." The mediating angel interprets the four horns to the prophet first of all as the horns which have scattered Judah; then literally, as the nations which have lifted up the horn against the land of Judah to scatter it. The horn is a symbol of power (cf. <a href="/amos/6-13.htm">Amos 6:13</a>). The horns therefore symbolize the powers of the world, which rise up in hostility against Judah and hurt it. The number four does not point to the four quarters of the heaven, denoting the heathen foes of Israel in all the countries of the world (Hitzig, Maurer, Koehler, and others). This view cannot be established from <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/1-10.htm">Zechariah 1:10</a>, for there is no reference to any dispersion of Israel to the four winds there. Nor does it follow from the perfect &#1494;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; that only such nations are to be thought of, as had already risen up in hostility to Israel and Judah in the time of Zechariah; for it cannot be shown that there were four such nations. At that time all the nations round about Judah were subject to the Persian empire, as they had been in Nebuchadnezzar's time to the Babylonian. Both the number four and the perfect ze&#772;ru&#772; belong to the sphere of inward intuition, in which the objects are combined together so as to form one complete picture, without any regard to the time of their appearing in historical reality. Just as the prophet in <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/6-1.htm">Zechariah 6:1-15</a> sees the four chariots all together, although they follow one another in action, so may the four horns which are seen simultaneously represent nations which succeeded one another. This is shown still more clearly by the visions in <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/2.htm">Daniel 2</a> and 7, in which not only the colossal image seen in a dream by Nebuchadnezzar (ch. 2), but also the four beasts which are seen by Daniel to ascend simultaneously from the sea, symbolize the four empires, which rose up in succession one after the other. It is to these four empires that the four horns of our vision refer, as Jerome, Abarb., Hengstenberg, and others have correctly pointed out, since even the picturing of nations or empires as horns points back to <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/7-7.htm">Daniel 7:7-8</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/8-3.htm">Daniel 8:3-9</a>. Zechariah sees these in all the full development of their power, in which they have oppressed and crushed the people of God (hence the perfect ze&#772;ru&#772;), and for which they are to be destroyed themselves. Za&#770;ra&#770;h, to scatter, denotes the dissolution of the united condition and independence of the nation of God. In this sense all four empires destroyed Judah, although the Persian and Grecian empires did not carry Judah out of their own land.<p>The striking combination, "Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem," in which not only the introduction of the name of Israel between Judah and Jerusalem is to be noticed, but also the fact that the nota acc. &#1488;&#1514; is only placed before Yehu&#772;da&#770;h and Yisra&#770;'e&#772;l, and not before Yeru&#772;sha&#770;laim also, is not explained on the ground that Israel denotes the kingdom of the ten tribes, Judah the southern kingdom, and Jerusalem the capital of the kingdom (Maurer, Umbreit, and others), for in that case Israel would necessarily have been repeated before Judah, and 'e&#772;th before Yeru&#772;sha&#770;laim. Still less can the name Israel denote the rural population of Judah (Hitzig), or the name Judah the princely house (Neumann). By the fact that 'e&#772;th is omitted before Yeru&#772;sha&#770;laim, and only Vav stands before it, Jerusalem is connected with Israel and separated from Judah; and by the repetition of 'e&#772;th before Yisra&#770;'e&#772;l, as well as before Yehu&#772;da&#770;h, Israel with Jerusalem is co-ordinated with Judah. Kliefoth infers from this that "the heathen had dispersed on the one hand Judah, and on the other hand Israel together with Jerusalem," and understands this as signifying that in the nation of God itself a separation is presupposed, like the previous separation into Judah and the kingdom of the ten tribes. "When the Messiah comes," he says, "a small portion of the Israel according to the flesh will receive Him, and so constitute the genuine people of God and the true Israel, the Judah; whereas the greater part of the Israel according to the flesh will reject the Messiah at first, and harden itself in unbelief, until at the end of time it will also be converted, and join the true Judah of Christendom." But this explanation, according to which Judah would denote the believing portion of the nation of twelve tribes, and Israel and Jerusalem the unbelieving, is wrecked on the grammatical difficulty that the cop. &#1493; is wanting before &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500;. If the names Judah and Israel were intended to be co-ordinated with one another as two different portions of the covenant nation as a whole, the two parts would necessarily have been connected together by the cop. Vav. Moreover, in the two co-ordinated names Judah and Israel, the one could not possibly stand in the spiritual sense, and the other in the carnal. The co-ordination of 'eth-Yehu&#772;da&#770;h with 'eth-Yisra&#770;'e&#772;l without the cop. Vav shows that Israel is really equivalent to the Jerusalem which is subordinated to it, and does not contain a second member (or part), which is added to it, - in other words, that Israel with Jerusalem is merely an interpretation or more precise definition of Yehu&#772;da&#770;h; and Hengstenberg has hit upon the correct idea, when he takes Israel as the honourable name of Judah, or, more correctly, as an honourable name for the covenant nation as then existing in Judah. This explanation is not rendered questionable by the objection offered by Koehler: viz., that after the separation of the two kingdoms, the expression Israel always denotes either the kingdom of the ten tribes, or the posterity of Jacob without regard to their being broken up, because this is not the fact. The use of the name Israel for Judah after the separation of the kingdoms is established beyond all question by <a href="/2_chronicles/12-1.htm">2 Chronicles 12:1</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/15-17.htm">2 Chronicles 15:17</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/19-8.htm">2 Chronicles 19:8</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-2.htm">2 Chronicles 21:2</a>, <a href="/2_chronicles/21-4.htm">2 Chronicles 21:4</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/23-2.htm">2 Chronicles 23:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-5.htm">2 Chronicles 24:5</a>, etc.<p>(Note: Gesenius has correctly observed in his Thesaurus, p. 1339, that "from this time (i.e., from the severance of the kingdom) the name of Israel began to be usurped by the whole nation that was then in existence, and was used chiefly by the prophets Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Deutero(?)-Isaiah, and after the captivity by Ezra and Nehemiah; from which it came to pass, that in the Paralipomena, even when allusion is made to an earlier period, Israel stands for Judah," although the proofs adduced in support of this from the passages quoted from the prophets need considerable sifting.)<p>Jehovah then showed the prophet four cha&#770;ra&#770;sh&#305;&#772;m, or workmen, i.e., smiths; and on his putting the question, "What have these come to do?" gave him this reply: "To terrify those," etc. For the order of the words &#1502;&#1492; &#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; &#1500;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1514;, instead of &#1502;&#1492; &#1500;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1514; &#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501;, see <a href="/genesis/42-12.htm">Genesis 42:12</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/2-12.htm">Nehemiah 2:12</a>; <a href="/judges/9-48.htm">Judges 9:48</a>. &#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; &#1492;&#1511;&#1468;&#1512;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; is not a nominative written absolutely at the head of the sentence in the sense of "these horns," for that would require &#1492;&#1511;&#1512;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; &#1492;&#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;; but the whole sentence is repeated from <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/1-2.htm">Zechariah 1:2</a>, and to that the statement of the purpose for which the smiths have come is attached in the form of an apodosis: "these are the horns, etc., and they (the smiths) have come." At the same time, the earlier statement as to the horns is defined more minutely by the additional clause &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1497; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;, according to the measure, i.e., in such a manner that no man lifted up his head any more, or so that Judah was utterly prostrate. Hacha&#774;r&#305;&#772;d, to throw into a state of alarm, as in <a href="/2_samuel/17-2.htm">2 Samuel 17:2</a>. Them ('o&#772;tha&#770;m): this refers ad sensum to the nations symbolized by the horns. Yaddo&#772;th, inf. piel of ya&#770;da&#770;h, to cast down, may be explained as referring to the power of the nations symbolized by the horns. 'Erets Yehu&#772;da&#770;h (the land of Judah) stands for the inhabitants of the land. The four smiths, therefore, symbolize the instruments "of the divine omnipotence by which the imperial power in its several historical forms is overthrown" (Kliefoth), or, as Theod. Mops. expresses it, "the powers that serve God and inflict vengeance upon them from many directions." The vision does not show what powers God will use for this purpose. It is simply designed to show to the people of God, that every hostile power of the world which has risen up against it, or shall rise up, is to be judged and destroyed by the Lord. </body></html>
