As the house of David were wont to glory in the honour of their being descended from him, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to value themselves above their brethren, because their city was the place of God’s peculiar residence, and the seat of the royal family; therefore, to take away all occasion of any such glorying and emulation, God here promises that he would first appear in behalf of those Jews that should live in the open country, in cottages or tents, in places unfortified. He will first save the weaker and despised, and then the stronger and more honourable. But this promise, which evidently looks forward to gospel times, seems principally to imply, that the conversion of the nation to Christianity will begin among the more poor, low, and obscure Jews, and not among the rich, great, and learned; lest the latter should glory over the others, as if the change among the people had been effected by their power, wisdom, or influence; or should assume any improper ascendency over their inferiors: in other words, that <span class="ital">the wise man </span>might not <span class="ital">glory in his wisdom, neither the mighty man in his might, </span>nor <span class="ital">the rich man in his riches; </span>and that <span class="ital">no flesh might glory in God’s presence, </span>but that <span class="ital">he that should glory might glory only in the Lord, </span><a href="/jeremiah/9-23.htm" title="Thus said the LORD, Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his might, let not the rich man glory in his riches:">Jeremiah 9:23</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/zechariah/12.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>12:1-8 Here is a Divine prediction, which will be a heavy burden to all the enemies of the church. But it is for Israel; for their comfort and benefit. It is promised that God will make foolish the counsels, and weaken the courage of the enemies of the church. The exact meaning is not clear; but God often begins by calling the poor and despised; and in that day even the feeblest will resemble David, and be as eminent in courage and every thing good. Desirable indeed is it that the examples and labours of Christians should render them as fire among wood, as a torch in a sheaf, to kindle the flame of Divine love, to spread religion on the right hand and on the left.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/zechariah/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Lord also shall save the tents of Judah first - Still it is, 'the Lord shall save.' We have, on the one side, the 'siege,' the gathering of all the peoples of the earth 'against Jerusalem, the horse and his rider.'

By 'the tents,' he probably indicates their defenselessness. God would 'save' them first; that 'the glory of the house of David - 'be not great against' or 'over Judah,' may not overshadow it; but all may be as one; for all is the free gift of God, the mere grace of God, that 'he that glorieth may glory in the Lord' <a href="/jeremiah/9-24.htm">Jeremiah 9:24</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/1-31.htm">1 Corinthians 1:31</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-17.htm">2 Corinthians 10:17</a>, and both "may own that, in both, the victory is the Lord's" (Jerome).<p>Lap.: "In Christ Jesus is neither Jew nor Greek; neither bond nor free, neither rich nor poor" <a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>; "but all are one," namely a new creation; yea in Christendom the poor are the highest, both because Christ "preached to the poor" <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18</a>, and pronounced the "poor blessed" <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/6-20.htm">Luke 6:20</a>, and He made the Apostles, being poor, nobles in His kingdom, through whom He converted kings and princes, as is written, "ye see your calling, brethren, that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble are called, but God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise, and the weak things of the would to confound the things which fire mighty ..." <a href="/1_corinthians/1-26.htm">1 Corinthians 1:26</a>; and, "Hath not God called the poor in this world, rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom, which God has promised to them that love Him?" <a href="/james/2-5.htm">James 2:5</a>.

The prophet declares that the open towns and villages of Judah, which can offer no effectual resistance to an enemy like the fortified city Jerusalem, shall be saved by the aid of God, as so often has happened in old time.
