Such an invasion is also here foretold; but it is not to be expected that all the particulars of a distant prophecy should be clearly understood, before the time of its accomplishment. It is at least likely that when the time shall come for the re-establishment of the Jews, (of which sufficient intimation is given in the prophecies both of the Old and New Testaments,) and they shall begin to collect themselves, and attempt a settlement in their ancient possessions, such a measure will create jealousy and uneasiness, in those powers more especially who are interested in the dominion over those countries. The Turks, we know, are at present, and long have been, in possession of the country of Palestine; and in the opinion of many, who have brought specious arguments to justify it, particularly of the learned Joseph Mede, (p. 674 and 816,) their prince is intended by Gog, prince of Meshech and Tubal, <a href="/ezekiel/38-2.htm" title="Son of man, set your face against Gog, the land of Magog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal, and prophesy against him,">Ezekiel 38:2</a>, &c.; and by the king of the north, <a href="/daniel/11-40.htm" title="And at the time of the end shall the king of the south push at him: and the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and he shall enter into the countries, and shall overflow and pass over.">Daniel 11:40</a>, &c.; concerning whom the like things are prophesied in those chapters respectively. Now should that power subsist at the time, it may fairly be presumed, that he, and any other power in the like circumstances, would oppose with all their might an attempt to set up an independent sovereignty in those parts. But, without pretending to determine precisely concerning the invaders, the substance of the prophecy in this, and on to the seventh verse of the next chapter, will be found to amount to this; that Jerusalem will be besieged by a multitude of hostile nations, to the great terror of the people in its vicinity, as well as of Judah itself; but that the attempts of those nations will be frustrated through the special interposition of the Deity, and will terminate in their total discomfiture and ruin, and in the permanent peace and prosperity of the victorious Jews. After which, the Jews will be brought at length to see and lament the sin of their forefathers in putting their Messiah to death, and thereupon will have the means of purification and atonement afforded them; and, being thus cleansed from past guilt, will renounce all their former offensive practices, and carefully abstain from a future repetition of them.” To these views of Dr. Blayney, on the important subject of the restoration of the Jews to their own land, however probable upon the whole, there seems to be one great objection. Inasmuch as God cast the Jews out of their land for rejecting and crucifying the Messiah, it seems highly improbable that he should restore them to it while they remain in impenitence and unbelief, and in a state of enmity to that Messiah. It appears much more likely that, previous to their restoration, they must be made sensible of the great guilt which their nation contracted by the commission of that sin, and of the various other sins which accompanied it; and that they must be truly humbled and brought to a thorough repentance as a people, before God will open the way in any degree for their restoration. It is certain that, as they were carried captive into Babylon chiefly to punish them for the sin of idolatry, so no way was made for their restoration from that captivity, till they were generally humbled and made truly penitent for that sin.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/zechariah/12.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>12:1-8 Here is a Divine prediction, which will be a heavy burden to all the enemies of the church. But it is for Israel; for their comfort and benefit. It is promised that God will make foolish the counsels, and weaken the courage of the enemies of the church. The exact meaning is not clear; but God often begins by calling the poor and despised; and in that day even the feeblest will resemble David, and be as eminent in courage and every thing good. Desirable indeed is it that the examples and labours of Christians should render them as fire among wood, as a torch in a sheaf, to kindle the flame of Divine love, to spread religion on the right hand and on the left.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/zechariah/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling - For encouragement, He promises the victory, and at first mentions the attack incidentally. Jerusalem is as a cup or basin, which its enemies take into their hands; a stone, which they put forth their strength to lift; but they themselves reel with the draught of God's judgments which they would give to others, they are torn by the stone which they would lift to fling. The image of the "cup" is mostly of God's displeasure, which is given to His own people, and then, His judgment of chastisement being exceeded, given in turn to those who had been the instruments of giving it . Thus, Isaiah speaks of "the cup of trembling." Thou, "Jerusalem, hast drunk the dregs of the cup of trembling, hast wrung them out. Therefore hear thou this, thou afflicted and drunken but not with wine. Thus saith thy Lord, the Lord, and thy God that pleadeth the cause of His people, Behold, I have taken out of thine hand the cup of trembling, the dregs of the cup of My fury; thou shalt no more drink it again: but I will put it into the hand of them that afflict thee" <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/51-17.htm">Isaiah 51:17</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/51-21.htm">Isaiah 51:21-23</a>.

English Version is better.<p>both against Judah&#8212;The Hebrew order of words is literally, "And also against Judah shall he (the foe) be in the siege against Jerusalem"; implying virtually that Judah, as it shares the invasion along with Jerusalem, so it shall, like the metropolis, prove a cup of trembling to the invaders. Maurer with Jerome translates, "Also upon Judah shall be (the cup of trembling); that is, some Jews forced by the foe shall join in the assault on Jerusalem, and shall share the overthrow with the besiegers.

The Targum renders it, <p>"a vessel full of inebriating liquor;'' <p>which intoxicates and makes giddy, and causes to tremble, stagger, and fall like a drunken man. The phrase denotes the punishment inflicted by the Lord upon the enemies of his church and people; see <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/51-22.htm">Isaiah 51:22</a>, <p>when they shall be in the siege both against Judah and against Jerusalem; not by Antiochus Epiphanes; nor by Titus Vespasian; nor by Gog and Magog, as Kimchi; but by the antichristian powers, especially the Mahometan nations, the Turks, which shall come against Jerusalem, when the Jews are returned thither, and resettled in their own land; see <a href="/ezekiel/38-5.htm">Ezekiel 38:5</a>. The words should be rendered, "and upon Judah shall it be" (y), i.e. the cup of trembling, "in the siege against Jerusalem"; according to the Targum, and the Jewish commentators, the nations of the earth shall bring the men of Judah by force to join with them in the siege of Jerusalem; as, in the times of Antiochus, many of the Jews were drawn in to fight against their brethren; but the meaning is, that not only the wrath of God will come upon the Mahometan nations that shall besiege Jerusalem; but also on those who bear the Christian name, who are Jews outwardly, but not inwardly; and shall join with the Turks in distressing the people of the Jews upon their return to their own land: to besiege Judah, or a country, is not proper and pertinent: Jerusalem, when again in the hands of the Jews, according to this prophecy, only is to be besieged, as it will, by the Turks; and it should be observed, that it never was besieged by Antiochus, and therefore the prophecy can not be applied to his times, as it is by many. <p>(y)    "et etiam super Jehudah erit", Pagninus, Montanus, Burkius. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/zechariah/12.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Behold, I will make Jerusalem a <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> cup of trembling to all the people around, when they shall be in the siege both against Judah <i>and</i> against Jerusalem.</span><p>(b) Jerusalem will be defended against all her enemies: so will God defend all Judah also, and will destroy the enemies.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/zechariah/12.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2</span>. <span class="ital">cup of trembling</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">bowl of reeling.</span> The word is used of the bowl or bason in which the blood of the Paschal lamb was caught, <a href="/exodus/12-22.htm" title="And you shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and strike the lintel and the two side posts with the blood that is in the basin; and none of you shall go out at the door of his house until the morning.">Exodus 12:22</a>, of the bowls used in the Temple service, <a href="/1_kings/7-50.htm" title="And the bowls, and the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons, and the censers of pure gold; and the hinges of gold, both for the doors of the inner house, the most holy place, and for the doors of the house, to wit, of the temple.">1 Kings 7:50</a>, and more generally, <a href="/2_samuel/17-28.htm" title="Brought beds, and basins, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and barley, and flour, and parched corn, and beans, and lentils, and parched vegetables,">2 Samuel 17:28</a>. Jerusalem stands forth like some vast bowl or bason, round which all nations gather, eager to swallow down its inviting contents. But the draft proves to be far other than they anticipated, and they reel and stagger back from it, confused and discomfited. A similar figure, though of a “cup” (a different Hebrew word), occurs frequently elsewhere, e.g. <a href="/psalms/75-8.htm" title="For in the hand of the LORD there is a cup, and the wine is red; it is full of mixture; and he pours out of the same: but the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall wring them out, and drink them.">Psalm 75:8</a>; <a href="/isaiah/51-17.htm" title="Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, which have drunk at the hand of the LORD the cup of his fury; you have drunken the dregs of the cup of trembling, and wrung them out.">Isaiah 51:17</a>; <a href="/isaiah/51-22.htm" title="Thus said your Lord the LORD, and your God that pleads the cause of his people, Behold, I have taken out of your hand the cup of trembling, even the dregs of the cup of my fury; you shall no more drink it again:">Isaiah 51:22</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/51-7.htm" title="Babylon has been a golden cup in the LORD's hand, that made all the earth drunken: the nations have drunken of her wine; therefore the nations are mad.">Jeremiah 51:7</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">people</span>] <span class="ital">peoples</span>, R.

The rendering in the text of A. V. cannot be maintained. That in the margin is, as Pusey remarks, “too elliptical.” The same may, with him, be said of the rendering which has found supporters both in ancient and modern times, <span class="ital">and also upon Judah shall it be</span> (<span class="ital">to be</span>, or <span class="ital">to fight</span>) <span class="ital">in the siege against Jerusalem</span>; i.e. either “it shall happen to Judah” voluntarily, through civil war, or (since that idea is absolutely contradicted by the full alliance and agreement between Judah and Jerusalem described in <a href="/context/zechariah/12-5.htm" title="And the governors of Judah shall say in their heart, The inhabitants of Jerusalem shall be my strength in the LORD of hosts their God....">Zechariah 12:5-6</a>), “it shall be incumbent upon Judah,” because he shall be compelled against his will by the invading nations to join them, to take part in the siege. Pusey’s own rendering, which is that adopted in R. V., is, “And also upon Judah will it be in the siege against Jerusalem, i.e. the burden of the word of the Lord, which was upon Israel, should be upon Judah.” The objection to this is that the reference to the beginning of <a href="/zechariah/12-1.htm" title="The burden of the word of the LORD for Israel, said the LORD, which stretches forth the heavens, and lays the foundation of the earth, and forms the spirit of man within him.">Zechariah 12:1</a> for a subject to the verb “it shall be” is remote and confusing. On the whole it is perhaps best to render, “And also on (or over) Judah it (i.e. the protection and deliverance implied in the first clause of the verse) shall be, in the siege,” &c. Signal as was the deliverance of Jerusalem in the time of Hezekiah, it did not extend beyond the city itself (<a href="/2_kings/18-13.htm" title="Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah did Sennacherib king of Assyria come up against all the fenced cities of Judah, and took them.">2 Kings 18:13</a>; <a href="/isaiah/36-1.htm" title="Now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, that Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the defended cities of Judah, and took them.">Isaiah 36:1</a>).

Jerusalem is the capital and type of the Messianic theocracy; the hostile powers of the world crowd round her, like thirsting men round a bowl of wine; but they find the drought is fatal to them; they stagger back discomfited and destroyed. The figure of the cup and drunkenness is often employed to denote the judgment of God upon transgressors, which makes them incapable of defence or escape (comp. <a href="/isaiah/51-17.htm">Isaiah 51:17</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/25-15.htm">Jeremiah 25:15</a>, etc.; Jeremiah 51:39, 57; <a href="/habakkuk/2-16.htm">Habakkuk 2:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The people;</span> <span class="accented">the peoples</span> (so vers. 3, 4, 6).

Pusey and Revised Version render, "And upon Judah also shall it [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> 'the burden'] be in the siege against Jerusalem." Cheyne, "And also on [or, 'over '] Judah it [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the protection and deliverance implied in the first clause of the verse] shall be, in the siege," etc. Any  interpretation of the passage which makes Judah join with the enemy in attacking Jerusalem is precluded by the very intimate union between Judah and Jerusalem denoted in vers. 4-7, and by the hostility of the nations against Judah. Cheyne's explanation is hardly a natural one, however suitable. Lowe ('Hebr. Stud. Comm.') renders, "And also on Judah [shall fall this reeling] during the siege [which is to take place] against Jerusalem." It seems best to render, with Alexander, "Also against Judah shall it be in the siege against Jerusalem," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> not only the mother city, but all the country, shall be exposed to hostile invasion. This suits ver. 5, where the chieftains of Judah are represented as trusting in the valour of the inhabitants of Jerusalem when they are incurring the same danger. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/zechariah/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div><a href="/zechariah/1-8.htm">Zechariah 1:8</a>.

And they answered the angel of Jehovah who stood among the myrtles, and said, We have gone through the earth, and, behold, the whole earth sits still, and at rest. <a href="/zechariah/1-12.htm">Zechariah 1:12</a>. Then the angel of Jehovah answered and said, Jehovah of hosts, how long wilt Thou not have compassion upon Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, with whom Thou hast been angry these seventy years? <a href="/zechariah/1-13.htm">Zechariah 1:13</a>. And Jehovah answered the angel that talked with me good words, comforting words. <a href="/zechariah/1-14.htm">Zechariah 1:14</a>. And the angel that talked with me said to me, Preach, and say, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, I have been jealous for Jerusalem and Zion with great jealousy, <a href="/zechariah/1-15.htm">Zechariah 1:15</a> and with great wrath I am angry against the nations at rest: for I had been angry for a little, but they helped for harm. <a href="/zechariah/1-16.htm">Zechariah 1:16</a>. Therefore thus saith Jehovah, I turn again to Jerusalem with compassion: my house shall be built in it, is the saying of Jehovah of hosts, and the measuring line shall be drawn over Jerusalem. <a href="/zechariah/1-17.htm">Zechariah 1:17</a>. Preach as yet, and say, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, My cities shall yet swell over with good, and Jehovah will yet comfort Zion, and will yet choose Jerusalem." The prophet sees, during the night of the day described in <a href="/zechariah/1-7.htm">Zechariah 1:7</a> (&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492; is the accusative of duration), in an ecstatic vision, not in a dream but in a waking condition, a rider upon a red horse in a myrtle-bush, stopping in a deep hollow, and behind him a number of riders upon red, speckled, and white horses (su&#772;s&#305;&#772;m are horses with riders, and the reason why the latter are not specially mentioned is that they do not appear during the course of the vision as taking any active part, whilst the colour of their horses is the only significant feature). At the same time he also sees, in direct proximity to himself, an angel who interprets the vision, and farther off (<a href="/zechariah/1-11.htm">Zechariah 1:11</a>) the angel of Jehovah also standing or stopping among the myrtle-bushes, and therefore in front of the man upon a red horse, to whom the riders bring a report, that they have gone through the earth by Jehovah's command and have found the whole earth quiet and at rest; whereupon the angel of Jehovah addresses a prayer to Jehovah for pity upon Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, and receives a good consolatory answer, which the interpreting angel conveys to the prophet, and the latter publicly proclaims in <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/1-14.htm">Zechariah 1:14-17</a>.<p>The rider upon the red horse is not to be identified with the angel of Jehovah, nor the latter with the angelus interpres. It is true that the identity of the rider and the angel of Jehovah, which many commentators assume, is apparently favoured by the circumstance that they are both standing among the myrtles (&#8219;o&#772;me&#772;d, stood; see <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/1-8.htm">Zechariah 1:8</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/1-10.htm">Zechariah 1:10</a>, and <a href="/zechariah/1-11.htm">Zechariah 1:11</a>); but all that follows from this is that the rider stopped at the place where the angel of Jehovah was standing, i.e., in front of him, to present a report to him of the state of the earth, which he had gone through with his retinue. This very circumstance rather favours the diversity of the two, inasmuch as it is evident from this that the rider upon the red horse was simply the front one, or leader of the whole company, who is brought prominently forward as the spokesman and reporter. If the man upon the red horse had been the angel of Jehovah Himself, and the troop of horsemen had merely come to bring information to the man upon the red horse, the troop of horsemen could not have stood behind him, but would have stood either opposite to him or in front of him. And the different epithets applied to the two furnish a decisive proof that the angel of the Lord and "the angel that talked with me" are not one and the same. The angel, who gives or conveys to the prophet the interpretation of the vision, is constantly called "the angel that talked with me," not only in <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/1-9.htm">Zechariah 1:9</a>, where it is preceded by an address on the part of the prophet to this same angel, but also in <a href="/zechariah/1-13.htm">Zechariah 1:13</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/1-14.htm">Zechariah 1:14</a>, and in the visions which follow (<a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/2-2.htm">Zechariah 2:2</a>, <a href="/zechariah/2-7.htm">Zechariah 2:7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/4-1.htm">Zechariah 4:1</a>, <a href="/zechariah/4-4.htm">Zechariah 4:4</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/5-5.htm">Zechariah 5:5</a>, <a href="/zechariah/5-10.htm">Zechariah 5:10</a>; <a href="/zechariah/6-4.htm">Zechariah 6:4</a>), from which it is perfectly obvious that &#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497; denotes the function which this angel performs in these visions (dibber be, signifying the speaking of God or of an angel within a man, as in <a href="/hosea/1-2.htm">Hosea 1:2</a>; <a href="/habakkuk/2-1.htm">Habakkuk 2:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/12-6.htm">Numbers 12:6</a>, <a href="/numbers/12-8.htm">Numbers 12:8</a>). His occupation, therefore, was to interpret the visions to the prophet, and convey the divine revelations, so that he was only an angelus interpres or collocutor. This angel appears in the other visions in company with other angels, and receives instructions from them (<a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/2-5.htm">Zechariah 2:5-8</a>); and his whole activity is restricted to the duty of conveying higher instructions to the prophet, and giving him an insight into the meaning of the visions, whereas the angel of Jehovah stands on an equality with God, being sometimes identified with Jehovah, and at other times distinguished from Him. (Compare the remarks upon this subject in the comm. on Genesis, Pent. pp. 118ff.) In the face of these facts, it is impossible to establish the identity of the two by the arguments that have been adduced in support of it. It by no means follows from <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/1-9.htm">Zechariah 1:9</a>, where the prophet addresses the mediator as "my lord," that the words are addressed to the angel of the Lord; for neither he nor the angelus interpres has been mentioned before; and in the visions persons are frequently introduced as speaking, according to their dramatic character, without having been mentioned before, so that it is only from what they say or do that it is possible to discover who they are. Again, the circumstance that in <a href="/zechariah/1-12.htm">Zechariah 1:12</a> the angel of the Lord presents a petition to the Supreme God on behalf of the covenant nation, and that according to <a href="/zechariah/1-13.htm">Zechariah 1:13</a> Jehovah answers the angelus interpres in good, comforting words, does not prove that he who receives the answer must be the same person as the intercessor: for it might be stated in reply to this, as it has been by Vitringa, that Zechariah has simply omitted to mention that the answer was first of all addressed to the angel of the Lord, and that it was through him that it reached the mediating angel; or we might assume, as Hengstenberg has done, that "Jehovah addressed the answer directly to the mediating angel, because the angel of the Lord had asked the question, not for his own sake, but simply for the purpose of conveying consolation and hope through the mediator to the prophet, and through him to the nation generally."<p>There is no doubt that, in this vision, both the locality in which the rider upon the red horse, with his troop, and the angel of the Lord had taken up their position, and also the colour of the horses, are significant. But they are neither of them easy to interpret. Even the meaning of metsulla&#770;h is questionable. Some explain it as signifying a "shady place," from &#1510;&#1500;, a shadow; but in that case we should expect the form metsilla&#770;h. There is more authority for the assumption that metsulla&#770;h is only another form for metsu&#772;la&#770;h, which is the reading in many codd., and which ordinarily stands for the depth of the sea, just as in <a href="/exodus/15-10.htm">Exodus 15:10</a> tsa&#770;lal signifies to sink into the deep. The Vulgate adopts this rendering: in profundo. Here it signifies, in all probability, a deep hollow, possibly with water in it, as myrtles flourish particularly well in damp soils and by the side of rivers (see Virgil, Georg. ii. 112, iv. 124). The article in bammetsulla&#770;h defines the hollow as the one which the prophet saw in the vision, not the ravine of the fountain of Siloah, as Hofmann supposes (Weissagung u. Erfllung, i. p. 333). The hollow here is not a symbol of the power of the world, or the abyss-like power of the kingdoms of the world (Hengstenberg and M. Baumgarten), as the author of the Chaldee paraphrase in Babele evidently thought; for this cannot be proved from such passages as <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/10-1.htm">Zechariah 10:1-1215:59</a>Isa <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/44-27.htm">Zechariah 44:27</a>, and <a href="/psalms/107-24.htm">Psalm 107:24</a>. In the myrtle-bushes, or myrtle grove, we have no doubt a symbol of the theocracy, or of the land of Judah as a land that was dear and lovely in the estimation of the Lord (cf. <a href="/daniel/8-9.htm">Daniel 8:9</a>; <a href="/daniel/11-16.htm">Daniel 11:16</a>), for the myrtle is a lovely ornamental plant. Hence the hollow in which the myrtle grove was situated, can only be a figurative representation of the deep degradation into which the land and people of God had fallen at that time. There is a great diversity of opinion as to the significance of the colour of the horses, although all the commentators agree that the colour is significant, as in <a href="/zechariah/6-2.htm">Zechariah 6:2</a>. and <a href="/revelation/6-2.htm">Revelation 6:2</a>., and that this is the only reason why the horses are described according to their colours, and the riders are not mentioned at all. About two of the colours there is no dispute. &#1488;&#1491;&#1493;&#1501;, red, the colour of the blood; and &#1500;&#1489;&#1503;, white, brilliant white, the reflection of heavenly and divine glory (<a href="/matthew/17-2.htm">Matthew 17:2</a>; <a href="/matthew/28-3.htm">Matthew 28:3</a>; <a href="/acts/1-10.htm">Acts 1:10</a>), hence the symbol of a glorious victory (<a href="/revelation/6-2.htm">Revelation 6:2</a>). The meaning of seruqq&#305;&#772;m is a disputed one. The lxx have rendered it &#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;, like &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1502;&#1510;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="/zechariah/6-3.htm">Zechariah 6:3</a>; the Itala and Vulgate, varii; the Peshito, versicolores. Hence su&#772;s&#305;&#772;m seruqq&#305;&#772;m would correspond to the &#x3b9;&#788;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c7;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; of <a href="/revelation/6-8.htm">Revelation 6:8</a>. The word seruqq&#305;&#772;m only occurs again in the Old Testament in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/16-8.htm">Isaiah 16:8</a>, where it is applied to the tendrils or branches of the vine, for which so&#772;re&#772;q (<a href="/isaiah/5-2.htm">Isaiah 5:2</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/2-21.htm">Jeremiah 2:21</a>) or sere&#772;qa&#770;h (<a href="/genesis/49-11.htm">Genesis 49:11</a>) is used elsewhere. On the other hand, Gesenius (Thes. s.v.) and others defend the meaning red, after the Arabic as&#780;qaru, the red horse, the fox, from s&#780;aqira, to be bright red; and Koehler understands by su&#772;s&#305;&#772;m seruqq&#305;&#772;m, bright red, fire-coloured, or bay horses. But this meaning cannot be shown to be in accordance with Hebrew usage: for it is a groundless conjecture that the vine branch is called so&#772;re&#772;q from the dark-red grapes (Hitzig on <a href="/isaiah/5-2.htm">Isaiah 5:2</a>); and the incorrectness of it is evident from the fact, that even the Arabic s&#780;aqira does not denote dark-red, but bright, fiery red. The Arabic translator has therefore rendered the Greek &#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#788;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; by Arab. as&#780;qaru in Sol 5:9; but &#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#788;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; answers to the Hebrew &#1488;&#1491;&#1493;&#1501;, and the lxx have expressed su&#772;s&#305;&#772;m 'a&#774;dumm&#305;&#772;m by &#x3b9;&#788;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; &#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#788;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769; both here and in <a href="/zechariah/6-2.htm">Zechariah 6:2</a>. If we compare this with ch. <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/6-2.htm">Zechariah 6:2</a>, where the chariots are drawn by red ('a&#774;dumm&#305;&#772;m, &#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#788;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;), black (shecho&#772;r&#305;&#772;m, &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;), white (lebha&#770;n&#305;&#772;m, &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;), and speckled (berudd&#305;&#772;m, &#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;) horses, and with <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/6.htm">Revelation 6</a>, where the first rider has a white horse (&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;), the second a red one (&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#788;&#x3c1;&#788;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;), the third a black one (&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;), the fourth a pale horse (&#x3c7;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;), there can be no further doubt that three of the colours of the horses mentioned here occur again in the two passages quoted, and that the black horse is simply added as a fourth; so that the seruqq&#305;&#772;m correspond to the berudd&#305;&#772;m of <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/6-3.htm">Zechariah 6:3</a>, and the &#x3b9;&#788;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c7;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; of <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/6-8.htm">Revelation 6:8</a>, and consequently sa&#770;ro&#772;q denotes that starling kind of grey in which the black ground is mixed with white, so that it is not essentially different from ba&#770;ro&#772;d, speckled, or black covered with white spots (<a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/31-10.htm">Genesis 31:10</a>, <a href="/genesis/31-12.htm">Genesis 31:12</a>).<p>By comparing these passages with one another, we obtain so much as certain with regard to the meaning of the different colours, - namely, that the colours neither denote the lands and nations to which the riders had been sent, as Hvernick, Maurer, Hitzig, Ewald, and others suppose; nor the three imperial kingdoms, as Jerome, Cyril, and others have attempted to prove. For, apart from the fact that there is no foundation whatever for the combination proposed, of the red colour with the south as the place of light, or of the white with the west, the fourth quarter of the heavens would be altogether wanting. Moreover, the riders mentioned here have unquestionably gone through the earth in company, according to <a href="/zechariah/1-8.htm">Zechariah 1:8</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/1-11.htm">Zechariah 1:11</a>, or at any rate there is no intimation whatever of their having gone through the different countries separately, according to the colour of their respective horses; and, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/6-6.htm">Zechariah 6:6</a>, not only the chariot with the black horses, but that with the white horses also, goes into the land of the south. Consequently the colour of the horses can only be connected with the mission which the riders had to perform. This is confirmed by <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/6.htm">Revelation 6</a>, inasmuch as a great sword is there given to the rider upon the red horse, to take away peace from the earth, that they may kill one another, and a crown to the rider upon the white horse, who goes forth conquering and to conquer (<a href="/revelation/6-2.htm">Revelation 6:2</a>), whilst the one upon the pale horse receives the name of Death, and has power given to him to slay the fourth part of the earth with sword, famine, and pestilence (<a href="/revelation/6-8.htm">Revelation 6:8</a>). It is true that no such effects as these are attributed to the riders in the vision before us, but this constitutes no essential difference. To the prophet's question, ma&#770;h-'e&#772;lleh, what are these? i.e., what do they mean? the angelus interpres, whom he addresses as "my lord" ('a&#774;do&#772;n&#305;&#772;), answers, "I will show thee what these be;" whereupon the man upon the red horse, as the leader of the company, gives this reply: "These are they whom Jehovah hath sent to go through the earth;" and then proceeds to give the angel of the Lord the report of their mission, viz., "We have been through the earth, and behold all the earth sitteth still and at rest." The man's answer (vayya&#8219;an, <a href="/zechariah/1-10.htm">Zechariah 1:10</a>) is not addressed to the prophet or to the angelus interpres, but to the angel of the Lord mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/1-11.htm">Zechariah 1:11</a>, to whom the former, with his horsemen (hence the plural, "they answered," in <a href="/zechariah/1-11.htm">Zechariah 1:11</a>), had given a report of the result of their mission. The verb &#8219;a&#770;na&#770;h, to answer, refers not to any definite question, but to the request for an explanation contained in the conversation between the prophet and the interpreting angel. &#1495;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, in <a href="/zechariah/1-10.htm">Zechariah 1:10</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/1-11.htm">Zechariah 1:11</a>, is not the land of Judah, or any other land, but the earth. The answer, that the whole earth sits still and at rest (&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1514; &#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1496;&#1514; denotes the peaceful and secure condition of a land and its inhabitants, undisturbed by any foe; cf. <a href="/zechariah/7-7.htm">Zechariah 7:7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-40.htm">1 Chronicles 4:40</a>, and <a href="/judges/18-27.htm">Judges 18:27</a>), points back to <a href="//biblehub.com/haggai/2-7.htm">Haggai 2:7-8</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/haggai/2-22.htm">Haggai 2:22-23</a>. God had there announced that for a little He would shake heaven and earth, the whole world and all nations, that the nations would come and fill His temple with glory. The riders sent out by God now return and report that the earth is by no means shaken and in motion, but the whole world sits quiet and at rest. We must not, indeed, infer from this account that the riders were all sent for the simple and exclusive purpose of obtaining information concerning the state of the earth, and communicating it to the Lord. For it would have been quite superfluous and unmeaning to send out an entire troop, on horses of different colours, for this purpose alone. Their mission was rather to take an active part in the agitation of the nations, if any such existed, and guide it to the divinely appointed end, and that in the manner indicated by the colour of their horses; viz., according to <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/6.htm">Revelation 6</a>, those upon the red horses by war and bloodshed; those upon the starling-grey, or speckled horses, by famine, pestilence, and other plagues; and lastly, those upon the white horses, by victory and the conquest of the world.<p>In the second year of Darius there prevailed universal peace; all the nations of the earlier Chaldaean empire were at rest, and lived in undisturbed prosperity. Only Judaea, the home of the nation of God, was still for the most part lying waste, and Jerusalem was still without walls, and exposed in the most defenceless manner to all the insults of the opponents of the Jews. Such a state of things as this necessarily tended to produce great conflicts in the minds of the more godly men, and to confirm the frivolous in their indifference towards the Lord. As long as the nations of the world enjoyed undisturbed peace, Judah could not expect any essential improvement in its condition. Even though Darius had granted permission for the building of the temple to be continued, the people were still under the bondage of the power of the world, without any prospect of the realization of the glory predicted by the earlier prophets (<a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/31.htm">Jeremiah 31</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/40.htm">Isaiah 40</a>), which was to dawn upon the nation of God when redeemed from Babylon. Hence the angel of the Lord addresses the intercessory prayer to Jehovah in <a href="/zechariah/1-12.htm">Zechariah 1:12</a> : How long wilt Thou not have compassion upon Jerusalem, etc.? For the very fact that the angel of the Lord, through whom Jehovah had formerly led His people and brought them into the promised land and smitten all the enemies before Israel, now appears again, contains in itself one source of consolation. His coming was a sign that Jehovah had not forsaken His people, and His intercession could not fail to remove every doubt as to the fulfilment of the divine promises. The circumstance that the angel of Jehovah addresses an intercessory prayer to Jehovah on behalf of Judah, is no more a disproof of his essential unity with Jehovah, than the intercessory prayer of Christ in <a href="//biblehub.com/john/17.htm">John 17</a> is a disproof of His divinity. The words, "over which Thou hast now been angry for seventy years," do not imply that the seventy years of the Babylonian captivity predicted by Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/25-11.htm">Jeremiah 25:11</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10</a>) were only just drawing to a close. They had already expired in the first year of the reign of Cyrus (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-22.htm">2 Chronicles 36:22</a>; <a href="/ezra/1-1.htm">Ezra 1:1</a>). At the same time, the remark made by Vitringa, Hengstenberg, and others, must not be overlooked, - namely, that these seventy years were completed twice, inasmuch as there were also (not perhaps quite, but nearly) seventy years between the destruction of Jerusalem and of the temple, and the second year of Darius. Now, since the temple was still lying in ruins in the second year of Darius, notwithstanding the command to rebuild it that had been issued by Cyrus (<a href="/haggai/1-4.htm">Haggai 1:4</a>), it might very well appear as though the troubles of the captivity would never come to an end. Under such circumstances, the longing for an end to be put to the mournful condition of Judah could not fail to become greater and greater; and the prayer, "Put an end, O Lord, put an end to all our distress," more importunate than ever.<p>Jehovah replied to the intercession of the angel of the Lord with good and comforting words. Debha&#770;r&#305;&#772;m to&#772;bh&#305;&#772;m are words which promise good, i.e., salvation (cf. <a href="/joshua/23-14.htm">Joshua 23:14</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10</a>). So far as they set before the people the prospect of the mitigation of their distress, they are nichumm&#305;&#772;m, consolations. The word nichumm&#305;&#772;m is a substantive, and in apposition to debha&#770;r&#305;&#772;m. Instead of the form nichumm&#305;&#772;m, the keri has the form nichum&#305;&#772;m, which is grammatically the more correct of the two, and which is written still more accurately nichu&#772;m&#305;&#772;m in some of the codd. in Kennicott. The contents of these words, which are addressed to the interpreting angel either directly or through the medium of the angel of Jehovah, follow in the announcement which the latter orders the prophet to make in <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/1-14.htm">Zechariah 1:14-17</a>. &#1511;&#1512;&#1488; (<a href="/zechariah/1-14.htm">Zechariah 1:14</a>) as in <a href="/isaiah/40-6.htm">Isaiah 40:6</a>. The word of the Lord contains two things: (1) the assurance of energetic love on the part of God towards Jerusalem (<a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/1-14.htm">Zechariah 1:14</a>, <a href="/zechariah/1-15.htm">Zechariah 1:15</a>); and (2) the promise that this love will show itself in the restoration and prosperity of Jerusalem (<a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/1-16.htm">Zechariah 1:16</a>, <a href="/zechariah/1-17.htm">Zechariah 1:17</a>). &#1511;&#1504;&#1468;&#1488;, to be jealous, applied to the jealousy of love as in <a href="/joel/2-18.htm">Joel 2:18</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/25-11.htm">Numbers 25:11</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/25-13.htm">Numbers 25:13</a>, etc., is strengthened by &#1511;&#1504;&#1488;&#1492; &#1490;&#1491;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492;. Observe, too, the use of the perfect &#1511;&#1504;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514;&#1497;, as distinguished from the participle &#1511;&#1510;&#1507;. The perfect is not merely used in the sense of "I have become jealous," expressing the fact that Jehovah was inspired with burning jealousy, to take Jerusalem to Himself (Koehler), but includes the thought that God has already manifested this zeal, or begun to put it in action, namely by liberating His people from exile. Zion, namely the mountain of Zion, is mentioned along with Jerusalem as being the site on which the temple stood, so that Jerusalem only comes into consideration as the capital of the kingdom. Jehovah is also angry with the self-secure and peaceful nations. The participle qo&#772;tse&#772;ph designates the wrath as lasting. Sha'a&#774;na&#770;n, quiet and careless in their confidence in their own power and prosperity, which they regard as secured for ever. The following word, &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, quod, introduces the reason why God is angry, viz., because, whereas He was only a little angry with Israel, they assisted for evil. &#1502;&#1506;&#1496; refers to the duration, not to the greatness of the anger (cf. <a href="/isaiah/54-8.htm">Isaiah 54:8</a>). &#1506;&#1494;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; &#1500;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492;, they helped, so that evil was the result (&#1500;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492; as in <a href="/jeremiah/44-11.htm">Jeremiah 44:11</a>), i.e., they assisted not only as the instruments of God for the chastisement of Judah, but so that harm arose from it, inasmuch as they endeavoured to destroy Israel altogether (cf. <a href="/isaiah/47-6.htm">Isaiah 47:6</a>). It is no ground of objection to this definition of the meaning of the words, that &#1500;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492; in that case does not form an appropriate antithesis to &#1502;&#1506;&#1496;, which relates to time (Koehler); for the fact that the anger only lasted a short time, was in itself a proof that God did not intend to destroy His people. To understand &#1506;&#1494;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; &#1500;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492; as only referring to the prolonged oppression and captivity, does not sufficiently answer to the words. Therefore (la&#770;khe&#772;n, <a href="/zechariah/1-16.htm">Zechariah 1:16</a>), because Jehovah is jealous with love for His people, and very angry with the heathen, He has now turned with compassion towards Jerusalem. The perfect &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; is not purely prophetic, but describes the event as having already commenced, and as still continuing. This compassion will show itself in the fact that the house of God is to be built in Jerusalem, and the city itself restored, and all the obstacles to this are to be cleared out of the way. The measuring line is drawn over a city, to mark off the space it is to occupy, and the plan upon which it is to be arranged. The chethib &#1511;&#1493;&#1492; bihtehc , probably to be read &#1511;&#1493;&#1492;, is the obsolete form, which occurs again in <a href="/1_kings/7-23.htm">1 Kings 7:23</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-39.htm">Jeremiah 31:39</a>, and was displaced by the contracted form &#1511;&#1493; (keri). But the compassion of God will not be restricted to this. The prophet is to proclaim still more ("cry yet," <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/1-17.htm">Zechariah 1:17</a>, referring to the "cry" in <a href="/zechariah/1-14.htm">Zechariah 1:14</a>). The cities of Jehovah, i.e., of the land of the Lord, are still to overflow with good, or with prosperity. Pu&#772;ts, to overflow, as in <a href="/proverbs/5-16.htm">Proverbs 5:16</a>; and &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468;&#1510;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; for &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468;&#1510;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492; (vid., Ewald, 196, c). The last two clauses round off the promise. When the Lord shall restore the temple and city, then will Zion and Jerusalem learn that He is comforting her, and has chosen her still. The last thought is repeated in <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/2-1.htm">Zechariah 2:1-13</a> :16 and <a href="/zechariah/3-2.htm">Zechariah 3:2</a>.<p>In this vision it is shown to the prophet, and through him to the people, that although the immediate condition of things presents no prospect of the fulfilment of the promised restoration and glorification of Israel, the Lord has nevertheless already appointed the instruments of His judgment, and sent them out to overthrow the nations of the world, that are still living at rest and in security, and to perfect His Zion. The fulfilment of this consolatory promise is neither to be transferred to the end of the present course of this world, as is supposed by Hofmann (Weiss. u. Erfll. i. 335), who refers to <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/14-18.htm">Zechariah 14:18-19</a> in support of this, nor to be restricted to what was done in the immediate future for the rebuilding of the temple and of the city of Jerusalem. The promise embraces the whole of the future of the kingdom of God; so that whilst the commencement of the fulfilment is to be seen in the fact that the building of the temple was finished in the sixth year of Darius, and Jerusalem itself was also restored by Nehemiah in the reign of Artaxerxes, these commencements of the fulfilment sim</body></html>
