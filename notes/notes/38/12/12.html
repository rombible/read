In Christ's first coming he bruised the serpent's head, and broke all the powers of darkness that fought against God's kingdom among men. In his second coming he will complete their destruction, when he shall put down all opposing rule, principality, and power; and death itself shall be swallowed up in that victory. The Holy Spirit is gracious and merciful, and is the Author of all grace or holiness. He, also, is the Spirit of supplications, and shows men their ignorance, want, guilt, misery, and danger. At the time here foretold, the Jews will know who the crucified Jesus was; then they shall look by faith to him, and mourn with the deepest sorrow, not only in public, but in private, even each one separately. There is a holy mourning, the effect of the pouring out of the Spirit; a mourning for sin, which quickens faith in Christ, and qualifies for joy in God. This mourning is a fruit of the Spirit of grace, a proof of a work of grace in the soul, and of the Spirit of supplications. It is fulfilled in all who sorrow for sin after a godly sort; they look to Christ crucified, and mourn for him. Looking by faith upon the cross of Christ will cause us to mourn for sin after a godly sort.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/zechariah/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This sorrow should be universal but also individual, the whole land, and that, family by family; the royal family in the direct line of its kings, and in a branch from Nathan, a son of David and whole brother of Solomon <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-5.htm">1 Chronicles 3:5</a>, which was continued on in private life yet was still to be an ancestral line of Jesus <a href="/luke/3-31.htm">Luke 3:31</a> : in like way the main priestly family from Levi, and a subordinate line from a grandson of Levi, "the family of Shimei" <a href="/numbers/3-23.htm">Numbers 3:23</a>; and all the remaining families, each with their separate sorrow, each according to Joel's call, "let the bridegroom go forth of his chamber and the bride out of her closet" <a href="//biblehub.com/joel/2-16.htm">Joel 2:16</a>, each denying himself the tenderest solaces of life.<p>Dionysius: "The ungrateful and ungodly, daily, as far as in them lies, crucify Christ, as Paul says, "crucifying to themselves the Son of God afresh and putting Him to an open shame" <a href="/hebrews/6-6.htm">Hebrews 6:6</a>.

"And I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and behold four horns. <a href="/zechariah/1-19.htm">Zechariah 1:19</a>. And I said to the angel that talked with me, What are these? And he said to me, These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem. <a href="/zechariah/1-20.htm">Zechariah 1:20</a>. And Jehovah showed me four smiths. <a href="/zechariah/1-21.htm">Zechariah 1:21</a>. And I said, What come these to do? And He spake to me thus: These are the horns which have scattered Judah, so that no one lifted up his head; these are now come to terrify them, to cast down the horns of the nations which have lifted up the horn against the land of Judah to scatter it." The mediating angel interprets the four horns to the prophet first of all as the horns which have scattered Judah; then literally, as the nations which have lifted up the horn against the land of Judah to scatter it. The horn is a symbol of power (cf. <a href="/amos/6-13.htm">Amos 6:13</a>). The horns therefore symbolize the powers of the world, which rise up in hostility against Judah and hurt it. The number four does not point to the four quarters of the heaven, denoting the heathen foes of Israel in all the countries of the world (Hitzig, Maurer, Koehler, and others). This view cannot be established from <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/1-10.htm">Zechariah 1:10</a>, for there is no reference to any dispersion of Israel to the four winds there. Nor does it follow from the perfect &#1494;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; that only such nations are to be thought of, as had already risen up in hostility to Israel and Judah in the time of Zechariah; for it cannot be shown that there were four such nations. At that time all the nations round about Judah were subject to the Persian empire, as they had been in Nebuchadnezzar's time to the Babylonian. Both the number four and the perfect ze&#772;ru&#772; belong to the sphere of inward intuition, in which the objects are combined together so as to form one complete picture, without any regard to the time of their appearing in historical reality. Just as the prophet in <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/6-1.htm">Zechariah 6:1-15</a> sees the four chariots all together, although they follow one another in action, so may the four horns which are seen simultaneously represent nations which succeeded one another. This is shown still more clearly by the visions in <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/2.htm">Daniel 2</a> and 7, in which not only the colossal image seen in a dream by Nebuchadnezzar (ch. 2), but also the four beasts which are seen by Daniel to ascend simultaneously from the sea, symbolize the four empires, which rose up in succession one after the other. It is to these four empires that the four horns of our vision refer, as Jerome, Abarb., Hengstenberg, and others have correctly pointed out, since even the picturing of nations or empires as horns points back to <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/7-7.htm">Daniel 7:7-8</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/8-3.htm">Daniel 8:3-9</a>. Zechariah sees these in all the full development of their power, in which they have oppressed and crushed the people of God (hence the perfect ze&#772;ru&#772;), and for which they are to be destroyed themselves. Za&#770;ra&#770;h, to scatter, denotes the dissolution of the united condition and independence of the nation of God. In this sense all four empires destroyed Judah, although the Persian and Grecian empires did not carry Judah out of their own land.<p>The striking combination, "Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem," in which not only the introduction of the name of Israel between Judah and Jerusalem is to be noticed, but also the fact that the nota acc. &#1488;&#1514; is only placed before Yehu&#772;da&#770;h and Yisra&#770;'e&#772;l, and not before Yeru&#772;sha&#770;laim also, is not explained on the ground that Israel denotes the kingdom of the ten tribes, Judah the southern kingdom, and Jerusalem the capital of the kingdom (Maurer, Umbreit, and others), for in that case Israel would necessarily have been repeated before Judah, and 'e&#772;th before Yeru&#772;sha&#770;laim. Still less can the name Israel denote the rural population of Judah (Hitzig), or the name Judah the princely house (Neumann). By the fact that 'e&#772;th is omitted before Yeru&#772;sha&#770;laim, and only Vav stands before it, Jerusalem is connected with Israel and separated from Judah; and by the repetition of 'e&#772;th before Yisra&#770;'e&#772;l, as well as before Yehu&#772;da&#770;h, Israel with Jerusalem is co-ordinated with Judah. Kliefoth infers from this that "the heathen had dispersed on the one hand Judah, and on the other hand Israel together with Jerusalem," and understands this as signifying that in the nation of God itself a separation is presupposed, like the previous separation into Judah and the kingdom of the ten tribes. "When the Messiah comes," he says, "a small portion of the Israel according to the flesh will receive Him, and so constitute the genuine people of God and the true Israel, the Judah; whereas the greater part of the Israel according to the flesh will reject the Messiah at first, and harden itself in unbelief, until at the end of time it will also be converted, and join the true Judah of Christendom." But this explanation, according to which Judah would denote the believing portion of the nation of twelve tribes, and Israel and Jerusalem the unbelieving, is wrecked on the grammatical difficulty that the cop. &#1493; is wanting before &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500;. If the names Judah and Israel were intended to be co-ordinated with one another as two different portions of the covenant nation as a whole, the two parts would necessarily have been connected together by the cop. Vav. Moreover, in the two co-ordinated names Judah and Israel, the one could not possibly stand in the spiritual sense, and the other in the carnal. The co-ordination of 'eth-Yehu&#772;da&#770;h with 'eth-Yisra&#770;'e&#772;l without the cop. Vav shows that Israel is really equivalent to the Jerusalem which is subordinated to it, and does not contain a second member (or part), which is added to it, - in other words, that Israel with Jerusalem is merely an interpretation or more precise definition of Yehu&#772;da&#770;h; and Hengstenberg has hit upon the correct idea, when he takes Israel as the honourable name of Judah, or, more correctly, as an honourable name for the covenant nation as then existing in Judah. This explanation is not rendered questionable by the objection offered by Koehler: viz., that after the separation of the two kingdoms, the expression Israel always denotes either the kingdom of the ten tribes, or the posterity of Jacob without regard to their being broken up, because this is not the fact. The use of the name Israel for Judah after the separation of the kingdoms is established beyond all question by <a href="/2_chronicles/12-1.htm">2 Chronicles 12:1</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/15-17.htm">2 Chronicles 15:17</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/19-8.htm">2 Chronicles 19:8</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-2.htm">2 Chronicles 21:2</a>, <a href="/2_chronicles/21-4.htm">2 Chronicles 21:4</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/23-2.htm">2 Chronicles 23:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-5.htm">2 Chronicles 24:5</a>, etc.<p>(Note: Gesenius has correctly observed in his Thesaurus, p. 1339, that "from this time (i.e., from the severance of the kingdom) the name of Israel began to be usurped by the whole nation that was then in existence, and was used chiefly by the prophets Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Deutero(?)-Isaiah, and after the captivity by Ezra and Nehemiah; from which it came to pass, that in the Paralipomena, even when allusion is made to an earlier period, Israel stands for Judah," although the proofs adduced in support of this from the passages quoted from the prophets need considerable sifting.)<p>Jehovah then showed the prophet four cha&#770;ra&#770;sh&#305;&#772;m, or workmen, i.e., smiths; and on his putting the question, "What have these come to do?" gave him this reply: "To terrify those," etc. For the order of the words &#1502;&#1492; &#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; &#1500;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1514;, instead of &#1502;&#1492; &#1500;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1514; &#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501;, see <a href="/genesis/42-12.htm">Genesis 42:12</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/2-12.htm">Nehemiah 2:12</a>; <a href="/judges/9-48.htm">Judges 9:48</a>. &#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; &#1492;&#1511;&#1468;&#1512;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; is not a nominative written absolutely at the head of the sentence in the sense of "these horns," for that would require &#1492;&#1511;&#1512;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; &#1492;&#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;; but the whole sentence is repeated from <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/1-2.htm">Zechariah 1:2</a>, and to that the statement of the purpose for which the smiths have come is attached in the form of an apodosis: "these are the horns, etc., and they (the smiths) have come." At the same time, the earlier statement as to the horns is defined more minutely by the additional clause &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1497; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;, according to the measure, i.e., in such a manner that no man lifted up his head any more, or so that Judah was utterly prostrate. Hacha&#774;r&#305;&#772;d, to throw into a state of alarm, as in <a href="/2_samuel/17-2.htm">2 Samuel 17:2</a>. Them ('o&#772;tha&#770;m): this refers ad sensum to the nations symbolized by the horns. Yaddo&#772;th, inf. piel of ya&#770;da&#770;h, to cast down, may be explained as referring to the power of the nations symbolized by the horns. 'Erets Yehu&#772;da&#770;h (the land of Judah) stands for the inhabitants of the land. The four smiths, therefore, symbolize the instruments "of the divine omnipotence by which the imperial power in its several historical forms is overthrown" (Kliefoth), or, as Theod. Mops. expresses it, "the powers that serve God and inflict vengeance upon them from many directions." The vision does not show what powers God will use for this purpose. It is simply designed to show to the people of God, that every hostile power of the world which has risen up against it, or shall rise up, is to be judged and destroyed by the Lord. </body></html>
