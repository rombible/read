A great increase to the church shall be made. Hitherto the Jews had been prone to learn the idolatries of other nations: what more unlikely than that they should teach religion to their conquerors, and to all the principal nations of the earth! Yet this is expressly foretold, and it came to pass. Hitherto the prophecy has been wonderfully fulfilled, and no doubt future events will explain it further. It is good to be with those who have God with them; if we take God for our God, we must take his people for our people, and be willing to take our lot with them. But let not any one think that mere zeal, either for Jews or Gentiles, will stand in the place of personal religion.

So Maimonides (s) says, that all these fasts shall cease in the times of the Messiah, with all others, which will be times of joy and gladness. <p>Therefore love the truth and peace; love to speak truth, and execute the judgment of peace, <a href="/zechariah/8-16.htm">Zechariah 8:16</a> or express by words and deeds love to Christ, who is the way, the truth, and the life; and also is our Peace, the Peacemaker, and Peace giver; and on these accounts, as well as on others, is greatly to be loved: likewise the Gospel, which is the word of truth, and the Gospel of peace; which contains nothing but truth, and is the ministry of reconciliation, and is to be loved on that account; and even peace with men is no further to be loved and sought after than as it is consistent with truth; and these being the principal things under the Gospel dispensation, these, and not fasts, or any other ceremonial observances, are to be attended to. <p>(o) T.

"And now, thus saith Jehovah of hosts, Set your heart upon your ways. <a href="/haggai/1-6.htm">Haggai 1:6</a>. Ye have sowed much, and brought in little: ye eat, and not for satisfaction; drink, and not to be filled with drink: ye clothe yourselves, and it does not serve for warming; and the labourer for wages works for wages into a purse pierced with holes." &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468; &#1500;&#1489;&#1489;&#1499;&#1501;, a favourite formula with Haggai (cf. v. 7 and <a href="//biblehub.com/haggai/2-15.htm">Haggai 2:15</a>, <a href="/haggai/2-18.htm">Haggai 2:18</a>). To set the heart upon one's ways, i.e., to consider one's conduct, and lay it to heart. The ways are the conduct, with its results. J. H. Michaelis has given it correctly, "To your designs and actions, and their consequences." In their ways, hitherto, they have reaped no blessing: they have sowed much, but brought only a little into their barns. &#1492;&#1489;&#1488;, inf. abs., to bring in what has been reaped, or bring it home. What is here stated must not be restricted to the last two harvests which they had had under the reign of Darius, as Koehler supposes, but applies, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/haggai/2-15.htm">Haggai 2:15-17</a>, to the harvests of many years, which had turned out very badly. The inf. abs., which is used in the place of the finite verb and determined by it, is continued in the clauses which follow, &#1488;&#1499;&#1493;&#1500;, etc. The meaning of these clauses is, not that the small harvest was not sufficient to feed and clothe the people thoroughly, so that they had to "cut their coat according to their cloth," as Maurer and Hitzig suppose, but that even in their use of the little that had been reaped, the blessing of God was wanting, as is not only evident from the words themselves, but placed beyond the possibility of doubt by <a href="/haggai/1-9.htm">Haggai 1:9</a>.<p>(Note: Calvin and Osiander see a double curse in <a href="/haggai/1-6.htm">Haggai 1:6</a>. The former says, "We know that God punishes men in both ways, both by withdrawing His blessing, so that the earth is parched, and the heaven gives no rain, and also, even when there is a good supply of the fruits of the earth, by preventing their satisfying, so that there is no real enjoyment of them. It often happens that men collect what would be quite a sufficient quantity for food, but for all that, are still always hungry. This kind of curse is seen the more plainly when God deprives the bread and wine of their true virtue, so that eating and drinking fail to support the strength.")<p>What they ate and drank did not suffice to satisfy them; the clothes which they procured yielded no warmth; and the ages which the day-labourer earned vanished just as rapidly as if it had been placed in a bag full of holes (cf. <a href="/leviticus/26-26.htm">Leviticus 26:26</a>; <a href="/hosea/4-10.htm">Hosea 4:10</a>; <a href="/micah/6-14.htm">Micah 6:14</a>). &#1500;&#1493; after &#1500;&#1495;&#1501; refers to the individual who clothes himself, and is to be explained from the phrase &#1495;&#1501; &#1500;&#1497;, "I am warm" (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/1-1.htm">1 Kings 1:1-2</a>, etc.). </body></html>
