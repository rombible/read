Therefore be faithful and honest in all your dealings; and let it be a pleasure to you to be so, though thereby you come short of the gains others get dishonestly; and, as much as in you lies, live peaceably with all men. Let the truths of God rule in your heads, and let the peace of God rule in your hearts. Thus the ancient servants of God drew the notice of heathen neighbours, whose prejudices were softened. A great increase to the church shall be made. Hitherto the Jews had been prone to learn the idolatries of other nations: what more unlikely than that they should teach religion to their conquerors, and to all the principal nations of the earth! Yet this is expressly foretold, and it came to pass. Hitherto the prophecy has been wonderfully fulfilled, and no doubt future events will explain it further. It is good to be with those who have God with them; if we take God for our God, we must take his people for our people, and be willing to take our lot with them. But let not any one think that mere zeal, either for Jews or Gentiles, will stand in the place of personal religion. Let us be living epistles of Christ, known and read of all men, so that others may wish to go with us, and to have their portion with us in the realms of bliss.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/zechariah/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For all these things do I hate - Literally, emphatic, "For they are all these things which I hate."

The prophet answers the query (Zec 7:3) as to the fast in the fifth month, by a reply applying to all their fasts: these are to be turned into days of rejoicing. So Jesus replied to His disciples when similarly consulting Him as to why fasting was not imposed by Him, as it was by John the Baptist.

Here follows the direct answer to the question originally proposed. <span class="accented">The fasts should be turned into joyful festivals, former calamities being forgotten. Then the change extending its influence, the heathen shall worship the God of Israel, and esteem it an honour to be received into fellowship with the Jewish nation.</span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/haggai/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>After rebutting the untenable grounds of excuse, Haggai calls attention in vv. 5, 6 to the curse with which God has punished, and is still punishing, the neglect of His house. <a href="/haggai/1-5.htm">Haggai 1:5</a>. "And now, thus saith Jehovah of hosts, Set your heart upon your ways. <a href="/haggai/1-6.htm">Haggai 1:6</a>. Ye have sowed much, and brought in little: ye eat, and not for satisfaction; drink, and not to be filled with drink: ye clothe yourselves, and it does not serve for warming; and the labourer for wages works for wages into a purse pierced with holes." &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468; &#1500;&#1489;&#1489;&#1499;&#1501;, a favourite formula with Haggai (cf. v. 7 and <a href="//biblehub.com/haggai/2-15.htm">Haggai 2:15</a>, <a href="/haggai/2-18.htm">Haggai 2:18</a>). To set the heart upon one's ways, i.e., to consider one's conduct, and lay it to heart. The ways are the conduct, with its results. J. H. Michaelis has given it correctly, "To your designs and actions, and their consequences." In their ways, hitherto, they have reaped no blessing: they have sowed much, but brought only a little into their barns. &#1492;&#1489;&#1488;, inf. abs., to bring in what has been reaped, or bring it home. What is here stated must not be restricted to the last two harvests which they had had under the reign of Darius, as Koehler supposes, but applies, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/haggai/2-15.htm">Haggai 2:15-17</a>, to the harvests of many years, which had turned out very badly. The inf. abs., which is used in the place of the finite verb and determined by it, is continued in the clauses which follow, &#1488;&#1499;&#1493;&#1500;, etc. The meaning of these clauses is, not that the small harvest was not sufficient to feed and clothe the people thoroughly, so that they had to "cut their coat according to their cloth," as Maurer and Hitzig suppose, but that even in their use of the little that had been reaped, the blessing of God was wanting, as is not only evident from the words themselves, but placed beyond the possibility of doubt by <a href="/haggai/1-9.htm">Haggai 1:9</a>.<p>(Note: Calvin and Osiander see a double curse in <a href="/haggai/1-6.htm">Haggai 1:6</a>. The former says, "We know that God punishes men in both ways, both by withdrawing His blessing, so that the earth is parched, and the heaven gives no rain, and also, even when there is a good supply of the fruits of the earth, by preventing their satisfying, so that there is no real enjoyment of them. It often happens that men collect what would be quite a sufficient quantity for food, but for all that, are still always hungry. This kind of curse is seen the more plainly when God deprives the bread and wine of their true virtue, so that eating and drinking fail to support the strength.")<p>What they ate and drank did not suffice to satisfy them; the clothes which they procured yielded no warmth; and the ages which the day-labourer earned vanished just as rapidly as if it had been placed in a bag full of holes (cf. <a href="/leviticus/26-26.htm">Leviticus 26:26</a>; <a href="/hosea/4-10.htm">Hosea 4:10</a>; <a href="/micah/6-14.htm">Micah 6:14</a>). &#1500;&#1493; after &#1500;&#1495;&#1501; refers to the individual who clothes himself, and is to be explained from the phrase &#1495;&#1501; &#1500;&#1497;, "I am warm" (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/1-1.htm">1 Kings 1:1-2</a>, etc.). </body></html>
