Those who believed the promises, were to show their faith by their works, and to wait the fulfilment. When God is displeased, he can cause trade to decay, and set every man against his neighbour; but when he returns in mercy, all is happy and prosperous. Surely believers in Christ must not trifle with the exhortation to put away lying, and to speak every man peace with his neighbour, to hate what the Lord hates, and to love that wherein he delights.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/zechariah/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For all these things do I hate - Literally, emphatic, "For they are all these things which I hate."

In order to appeal to the conscience of the people, God meets them with the question in <a href="/haggai/1-4.htm">Haggai 1:4</a> : "Is it time for you yourselves to live in your houses wainscoted, whilst this house lies waste?" The &#1492; before &#1506;&#1514; is not the article, but &#1492; interr. &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501; is added to strengthen the pronoun (cf. Ges. 121, 3). Sephu&#772;n&#305;&#772;m without the article is connected with the noun, in the form of an apposition: in your houses, they being wainscoted, i.e., with the inside walls covered or inlaid with costly wood-work. Such were the houses of the rich and of the more distinguished men (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/22-14.htm">Jeremiah 22:14</a>; <a href="/1_kings/7-7.htm">1 Kings 7:7</a>). Living in such houses was therefore a sing of luxury and comfort. &#1493;&#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; is a circumstantial clause, which we should express by "whilst this house," etc. With this question the prophet cuts off all excuse, on the ground that the circumstances of the times, and the oppression under which they suffered, did not permit of the rebuilding of the temple. If they themselves lived comfortably in wainscoted houses, their civil and political condition could not be so oppressive, that they could find in that a sufficient excuse for neglecting to build the temple. Even if the building of the temple had been prohibited by an edict of Pseudo-Smerdes, as many commentators infer from <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/4-8.htm">Ezra 4:8-24</a>, the reign of this usurper only lasted a few months; and with his overthrow, and the ascent of the throne by Darius Hystaspes, a change had taken place in the principles of government, which might have induced the heads of Judah, if the building of the house of God had rested upon their hearts as it did upon the heart of king David (<a href="/2_samuel/7-2.htm">2 Samuel 7:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/132-2.htm">Psalm 132:2-5</a>), to take steps under the new king to secure the revocation of this edict, and the renewal of the command issued by Cyrus. </body></html>
