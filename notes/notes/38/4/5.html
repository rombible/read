We should beg of God that, whenever he speaks to us, he would awaken us, and we should then stir up ourselves. The church is a golden candlestick, or lamp-bearer, set up for enlightening this dark world, and holding forth the light of Divine revelation. Two olive trees were seen, one on each side the candlestick, from which oil flowed into the bowl without ceasing. God brings to pass his gracious purposes concerning his church, without any art or labour of man; sometimes he makes use of his instruments, yet he needs them not. This represented the abundance of Divine grace, for the enlightening and making holy the ministers and members of the church, and which cannot be procured or prevented by any human power. The vision assures us that the good work of building the temple, should be brought to a happy end. The difficulty is represented as a great mountain. But all difficulties shall vanish, and all the objections be got over. Faith will remove mountains, and make them plains. Christ is our Zerubbabel; mountains of difficulty were in the way of his undertaking, but nothing is too hard for him. What comes from the grace of God, may, in faith, be committed to the grace of God, for he will not forsake the work of his own hands.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/zechariah/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Osorius: "Awakened from his state of sleep, even thus the prophet seemed slowly to understand what was shown him.

Sun, moon, enter into their habitation at the light of Thine arrows which shoot by, at the shining of the lightning of Thy spear." The effect of the coming of God upon the mountains was already referred to in <a href="/habakkuk/3-6.htm">Habakkuk 3:6</a>. There they crumbled into ruins, here they writhe with terror. This difference is to be explained from the fact that there (<a href="/habakkuk/3-6.htm">Habakkuk 3:6</a>) the general effect of the omnipotence of God upon nature was intended, whereas here (<a href="//biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-10.htm">Habakkuk 3:10</a>, <a href="/habakkuk/3-11.htm">Habakkuk 3:11</a>) the special effect is described, which is produced upon nature by the judgment about to be executed by God upon the nations. The perfects in the description represent this effect as following immediately upon the coming of God. But in the first clause of <a href="/habakkuk/3-10.htm">Habakkuk 3:10</a> the perfect &#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498; is followed by the imperfect &#1497;&#1495;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;, because the writhing is a lasting condition. The force of the description is heightened by the omission of the copula before the clauses and the particular objects. The two verbs of the first clause stand in the relation of cause and effect to one another: when the mountains have seen Thee, they writhe with terror. The further description is not founded upon the idea of a terrible storm; for there is no reference to thunder, nor even to lightnings, but only to the arrows (<a href="/habakkuk/3-11.htm">Habakkuk 3:11</a>), which may be explained from the idea of God, as a warlike hero, making bare His bow. The colours and different features of the description are borrowed from the judgment of the flood. <a href="/habakkuk/3-10.htm">Habakkuk 3:10</a> (a and b) points to this divine judgment of the olden time, both the coming of the showers of water (geshem as in <a href="/genesis/7-12.htm">Genesis 7:12</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/8-2.htm">Genesis 8:2</a>, and strengthened by mayim, analogous to hammabbu&#772;l ha&#770;ya&#770;h mayim in <a href="/genesis/7-6.htm">Genesis 7:6</a>; &#8219;a&#770;bhar as in <a href="/nahum/3-19.htm">Nahum 3:19</a>; <a href="/psalms/48-5.htm">Psalm 48:5</a>), and also the na&#770;than teho&#772;m qo&#772;lo&#772;, the raging outburst of the abyss. Teho&#772;m is the mass of water in the abyss, not merely that of the ocean, but that of the subterranean waters also (<a href="/genesis/49-25.htm">Genesis 49:25</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/33-13.htm">Deuteronomy 33:13</a>), the "great deep" (teho&#772;m rabba&#770;h), whose fountains were broken up at the flood (<a href="/genesis/7-11.htm">Genesis 7:11</a>); and not the ocean of heaven, as Hitzig erroneously infers from <a href="/genesis/7-11.htm">Genesis 7:11</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/8-2.htm">Genesis 8:2</a>, and <a href="/proverbs/8-27.htm">Proverbs 8:27</a>. To this mass of water, which is called teho&#772;m from its roaring depth, the prophet attributes a voice, which it utters, to express the loud, mighty roaring of the waters as they rush forth from the bursting earth. As at the time of the flood, which was a type of the last judgment (<a href="/isaiah/24-18.htm">Isaiah 24:18</a>), the windows of heaven and the fountains of the deep were opened, so that the upper and lower waters, which are divided by the firmament, rushed together again, and the earth returned, as it were, to its condition before the second day of creation; so here also the rivers of the earth and rain-showers of heaven come together, so that the abyss roars up with a loud noise (Delitzsch). This roaring outburst of the mass of waters from the heart of the earth is then represented as a lifting up of the hands to heaven, with reference to the fact that the waves are thrown up. Ro&#772;m  equals  ru&#772;m (<a href="/proverbs/25-3.htm">Proverbs 25:3</a>; <a href="/proverbs/21-4.htm">Proverbs 21:4</a>) is an accusative of direction, like ma&#770;ro&#772;m in <a href="/2_kings/19-22.htm">2 Kings 19:22</a>. &#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;, for &#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1493;, a full-sounding and more extended form, possibly to express by the rhythm the greatness of the prodigy, how magna vi brachii tollunt (Delitzsch). The lifting up of the hands is not a gesture denoting either an oath or rebellion; but it is an involuntary utterance of terror, of restlessness, of anguish, as it were, with a prayer for help (Delitzsch). </body></html>
