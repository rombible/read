Zerubbabel and Joshua, this prince and this priest, were endued with the gifts and graces of God's Spirit. They lived at the same time, and both were instruments in the work and service of God. Christ's offices of King and Priest were shadowed forth by them. From the union of these two offices in his person, both God and man, the fullness of grace is received and imparted. They built the temple, the church of God. So does Christ spiritually. Christ is not only the Messiah, the Anointed One himself, but he is the Good Olive to his church; and from his fulness we receive. And the Holy Spirit is the unction or anointing which we have received. From Christ the Olive Tree, by the Spirit the Olive Branch, all the golden oil of grace flows to believers, which keeps their lamps burning. Let us seek, through the intercession and bounty of the Saviour, supplies from that fulness which has hitherto sufficed for all his saints, according to their trials and employments. Let us wait on him in his ordinances, desiring to be sanctified wholly in body, soul, and spirit.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/zechariah/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>These are the two sons of oil - Probably not as themselves anointed, (for another word is used for this. Which stand by the Lord of the whole earth, as His servants and ministers. The candlestick is almost authoritatively interpreted for us, by the adoption of the symbol in the Revelation, where our Lord is exhibited "as walking in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks" <a href="/revelation/1-13.htm">Revelation 1:13</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/2-1.htm">Revelation 2:1</a>, and, it is said, "the seven candlesticks are the seven Churches" <a href="/revelation/1-20.htm">Revelation 1:20</a>; and our Lord says to the Apostles, on whom He founded the Church; "Ye are the light of the world: men light a candle, and put it on a candlestick, and it giveth light to them that are in the house" (<a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/5-14.htm">Matthew 5:14-15</a>, compare <a href="/philippians/2-15.htm">Philippians 2:15</a>). Cyril: "The golden candlestick is the Church, as being honored in the world, most bright in virtues, raised on high exceedingly by the doctrines of the true knowledge of God. But there are seven lamps, having light, not of their own, but brought to them from without, and nourished by the supplies through the olive tree. These signify the holy apostles, evangelists, and those who, each in their season, were teachers of the churches, receiving, like lamps, into their mind and heart the illumination from Christ, which is nourished by the supplies of the Spirit, casting forth light to those who are in the house."<p>Theodoret: "The pipes of the lamps, which pour in the oil, signify the unstinted prodigality of the loving-kindness of God to man." The most difficult of explanation (as is plain from the variety of interpretations) is this last symbol of the spikes of the olive-tree, through whom flows the oil of the Holy Spirit to the candlesticks, and which yet represent created beings, ministers, and servants of God. Perhaps it represents that, in the church, grace is ministered through men, as Paul says, "Unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ. Wherefore he saith, when He ascended up on high, He led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men. And He gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastor's and teachers, for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ - that we - may grow up into Him in all things which is the Head, even Christ, from whom the whole body, fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love" <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/4-7.htm">Ephesians 4:7-8</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/4-11.htm">Ephesians 4:11-12</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/4-14.htm">Ephesians 4:14-16</a>.<p>What Paul expresses by "all the body, having nourishment ministered and being knit together by joints and bands, from the Head, and so increasing with the increase of God" <a href="//biblehub.com/colossians/2-19.htm">Colossians 2:19</a>, (as he elsewhere speaks of "the ministration of the Spirit" <a href="/2_corinthians/3-8.htm">2 Corinthians 3:8</a>; "he that ministereth to you the Spirit" <a href="/galatians/3-5.htm">Galatians 3:5</a>) "that" Zechariah may express by the oil being poured, through the living  tubes, the bowl, the sevenfold pipes, into the lamps, which shone with the God-given light. So Paul speaks again, of "having this treasure in earthen vessels" <a href="/2_corinthians/4-7.htm">2 Corinthians 4:7</a>. Joshua and Zerubbabel, as representatives of the priestly and royal offices, shadowed forth what was united in Christ, and so, in their several offices, they might be included in the symbol of the olive-tree, they could not exhaust it; for people who, having served God in their generation, were to pass away, could not be alone intended in a vision, which describes the abiding being of the church.<p>Osorius: "Christ is both all-holy Priest and supreme eternal King. In both ways He supplies to us the light which He brought. For from Him piety and righteousness flow unceasingly to the Church, that it never lack the heavenly light. The oil is expressed into tubes; thence passed through pipes into the vessel which contains the lamps; to designate the various suppliers of light, which, the nearer they are to the effluence of the oil, the more they resemble Him by whom they are appointed to so divine an office. The seven lamps are the manifold Churches, distinct in place but most closely bound together by the consent of one faith and by the bond of charity. For although the Church is one, yet it is distinct according to the manifold variety of nations. They are said to be seven, both on account of the seven gifts of the Spirit, mentioned by Isaiah, and because in the <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/3.htm">Numbers 3</a> and 4, is contained an emblem of piety and righteousness. There are 7 pipes to each lamp, to signify that each has need of many instruments, that the light may be maintained longer. For as there are diversities of gifts, so must there needs be the functions of many ministers, to complete one work. But the lamps are set in a circle, that the oil of one may flow more readily into others, and it, in turn, may receive from others their superabundance, to set forth the communion of love and the indissoluble community of faith." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/zechariah/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. anointed ones&#8212;literally, "sons of oil" (Isa 5:1, Margin). Joshua the high priest, and Zerubbabel the civil ruler, must first be anointed with grace themselves, so as to be the instruments of furnishing it to others (compare 1Jo 2:20, 27).   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/zechariah/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Not Enoch and Elias, nor the two witnesses, nor Peter and Paul, nor the two churches of Jew and Gentile; nor principally Zerubbabel and Joshua, though perhaps the exposition may glance upon them, and the two orders, magistracy and ministry, in them; as these are types of Christ in his two offices. King and Priest, or Christ and the Comforter: in this I determine nothing. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/zechariah/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then said he, These are the two anointed ones,.... Or "sons of oil" (t). Some think the gifts and graces of the Spirit are meant, which come from the God of all grace, remain with Christ, are given freely by him to the sons of God, and are always for the service of the church, and sufficient for it; others, Christ the Son of God, and the Holy Spirit. Christ is the anointed One, or son of oil, being anointed with the Holy Ghost to the office of Prophet, Priest, and King; and with which oil he has supplied his candlestick, the church, in all ages. The Holy Spirit is the oil of gladness, and that anointing which teacheth all things. And this is the sense of Capellus, as has been observed on <a href="/zechariah/4-2.htm">Zechariah 4:2</a>. And the learned and judicious Pemble makes a "query" of it, whether Christ and the Comforter; or Christ in his two natures; or Christ in his two offices of King and Priest of his church; or how else the words are to be understood: and this was the sense of Origen long ago, though censured by Jerom; it may be the rather, because he interprets the candlestick of the Father. But these epithets, "anointed ones", and "sons of oil", are very suitable to them; the one being called the Messiah, or anointed; and the other the unction, and the oil of gladness: and indeed, if by the golden oil emptied out of them is meant the grace of God, as it frequently signifies in Scripture, no other can be meant; since they are the inexhaustible fountain of all grace and gifts to the church in all ages, whereby it is supplied and supported; and may be said to "stand before the Lord of the whole earth", God the Father; who does not immediately by himself administer to the church, but by Christ the Head of it; and Christ communicates by his Spirit, whom he sends from himself, and from the Father: and the rather they may be thought to be meant, since the ministers of the word seem to be designed by the seven lamps which receive the oil, or gifts and graces of the Spirit, fitting them for their work, from the bowl on the top of the candlestick, which is supplied with it from these two olive trees; and therefore must be distinct from them, or otherwise they will be said to be supplied from themselves: though, whereas both Christ and the Spirit communicate by the word and the ordinances, administered by the faithful dispensers of the word; hence those witnesses of Christ, in all ages, may with propriety enough be called two anointed ones, and "the two olive trees", as they are in <a href="/revelation/11-4.htm">Revelation 11:4</a> where there is a plain allusion to this passage. The Targum renders the words, "these are the two sons of princes", or "great men". Some Jewish writers interpret them of their two Messiahs, Messiah ben Joseph, and Messiah ben David (u). Some interpreters understand by them Enoch and Elias; others Peter and Paul; others, better, with Kimchi and Ben Melech, Joshua and Zerubbabel, the one anointed for the priesthood, and the other for the kingdom; of which two offices Jarchi interprets them; and others the two churches, Jewish and Christian. <p>That stand by the Lord of the whole earth; the Creator and Governor of the universe: ministers of the word are on his side, abide by his truths and ordinances, and are faithful to his cause and interest: or, "before the Lord of the whole earth" (w); they are his ministers, and serve him; they "stand", as it becomes them, which shows their work is not done; and that it is the Lord's work they are engaged in; and that they continue and persevere in it: likewise it shows that they are under his eye, notice, dispose, care, and protection; that they are in his favour, and enjoy his presence. How this may be applied to the two divine Persons standing by or before God the Father has been before observed, and to be understood of them as in their office capacity. <p>(t)  "filii olei", V. L.

V.). “Probably not as themselves anointed (for another word is used for this, and the whole vision has turned on the use of oil as an instrument of light, not of anointing) but as themselves abundantly ministering the stream which is the source of light.” Pusey, who compares the expression “son of oil,” i.e. fertile in producing oil, <a href="/isaiah/5-1.htm" title="Now will I sing to my well beloved a song of my beloved touching his vineyard. My well beloved has a vineyard in a very fruitful hill:">Isaiah 5:1</a>. The reference here is generally supposed to be to Zerubbabel and Joshua, as representing the kingly and priestly offices, the channels through which God supplies His Church. It may be doubted, however, whether the angel does not purposely avoid giving a definite, and especially a <span class="ital">human</span> meaning to these symbols. The tenor of the whole vision is, “by My Spirit, saith the Lord of hosts.” These “sons of oil,” then, are agents or agencies, near to God and beyond our ken, “that stand by the Lord of the whole earth.” With this view would seem to accord the fact, that the two mysterious “Witnesses,” in the Book of Revelation (<a href="/zechariah/11-4.htm" title="Thus said the LORD my God; Feed the flock of the slaughter;">Zechariah 11:4</a>), are spoken of as being “<span class="ital">the</span> two olive trees … standing before the God of the earth”; with an obvious reference to Zechariah’s vision.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/zechariah/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The two anointed ones;</span> literally, <span class="accented">the two sons of oil</span>; so the Revised Version; Vulgate, <span class="accented">filii olei</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "sons of fatness" (comp. <a href="/isaiah/5-1.htm">Isaiah 5:1</a>). By them are intended the two powers, the regal and the sacerdotal, through which God's help and protection are dispensed to the theocracy. Oil was used in appointing to both these offices (comp. <a href="/leviticus/21-10.htm">Leviticus 21:10</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/10-1.htm">1 Samuel 10:1</a>). The expression, "son of," in many cases denotes a quality or property, like "son of Belial," "son of might;" so here Dr. Alexander considers that "sons of oil" means people possessed of oil, oil bearers, channels through which the oil flowed to others. Zerubbabel and Joshua are representatives of the civil and priestly authorities, but the text seems expressly to avoid naming any human agents, in order to show that the symbol must not be limited to individuals. Nor, indeed, must it be confined to the Jewish Church and state; it looks forward to the time when Jew and Gentile shall unite in  upholding the Church of God. <span class="cmt_word">That stand by the Lord of the whole earth;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> ready as his ministers to do him service. There is a reference to this passage in <a href="/revelation/11-4.htm">Revelation 11:4</a>, where the "two witnesses" are called "the two olive trees.., standing Before the Lord of the earth" (Perowne). The vision, as we have seen, prefigures primarily the completion of the temple and the restoration of its worship, and secondly the establishment of the Christian Church by the advent of Messiah. The several parts of the vision may be thus explained. The candelabrum is a symbol of the Jewish Church and theocracy, in accordance with the imagery in the Apocalypse, where the seven candlesticks are seven Churches (<a href="/revelation/1-20.htm">Revelation 1:20</a>). It is made of gold as precious in God's sight, and to be kept pure and unalloyed; it is placed in the sanctuary, and has seven lamps, to indicate that it is bright with the grace of God, and is meant to shed its light around at all times, as Christian men are bidden to shine like lights in the world (<a href="/matthew/5-16.htm">Matthew 5:16</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-15.htm">Philippians 2:15</a>). The oil that supplies the lamps is the grace of God, the influence of the Holy Spirit, which alone enables the Church to shine and to accomplish its appointed work. The two olive trees are the two authorities, viz. the civil and sacerdotal, through which God communicates his grace to the Church; these stand by the Lord Because, instituted by him, they carry out his will in the ordering, guiding, extending, and purifying his kingdom among men. The two olive branches remit their oil into one receptacle, because the two authorities, the regal and priestly, are intimately connected and united, and their action tends to one end, the promotion of God's glory in the salvation of men. In Messiah these offices are united; he is the channel of Divine grace, the source of light to the whole world. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/habakkuk/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Although trembling on account of the approaching trouble, the prophet will nevertheless exult in the prospect of the salvation that he foresees. <a href="/habakkuk/3-18.htm">Habakkuk 3:18</a>. "But I, in Jehovah will I rejoice, will shout in the God of my salvation. <a href="/habakkuk/3-19.htm">Habakkuk 3:19</a>. Jehovah the Lord is my strength, and makes my feet like the hinds, and causes me to walk along upon my high places." The turning-point is introduced with &#1493;&#1488;&#1504;&#1497; ht, as is frequently the case in the Psalms. For this exaltation out of the sufferings of this life to believing joy in God, compare <a href="/psalms/5-8.htm">Psalm 5:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/13-6.htm">Psalm 13:6</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/31-15.htm">Psalm 31:15</a>, etc. &#1506;&#1500;&#1494;, a softened form of &#1506;&#1500;&#1509;, to rejoice in God (cf. <a href="/psalms/5-12.htm">Psalm 5:12</a>), i.e., so that God is the inexhaustible source and infinite sphere of the joy, because He is the God of salvation, and rises up to judgment upon the nations, to procure the salvation of His people (<a href="/habakkuk/3-13.htm">Habakkuk 3:13</a>). Elo&#772;he&#772; yish&#8219;&#305;&#772; (the God of my salvation), as in <a href="/psalms/18-47.htm">Psalm 18:47</a>; <a href="/psalms/25-5.htm">Psalm 25:5</a> (see at <a href="/micah/7-7.htm">Micah 7:7</a>). The thoughts of the 19th verse are also formed from reminiscences of <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/18.htm">Psalm 18</a>:the first clause, "the Lord is my strength," from <a href="/psalms/18-33.htm">Psalm 18:33</a>. "God, who girdeth me with strength," i.e., the Lord gives me strength to overcome all tribulation (cf. <a href="/psalms/27-1.htm">Psalm 27:1</a> and <a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9</a>). The next two clauses are from <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/18-34.htm">Psalm 18:34</a>, "He maketh my feet like hinds'," according to the contracted simile common in Hebrew for "hinds' feet;" and the reference is to the swiftness of foot, which was one of the qualifications of a thorough man of war (<a href="/2_samuel/1-23.htm">2 Samuel 1:23</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/12-8.htm">1 Chronicles 12:8</a>), so as to enable him to make a sudden attack upon the enemy, and pursue him vigorously. Here it is a figurative expression for the fresh and joyous strength acquired in God, which Isaiah calls rising up with eagles' wings (<a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/40-29.htm">Isaiah 40:29-31</a>). Causing to walk upon the high places of the land, was originally a figure denoting the victorious possession and government of a land. It is so in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-13.htm">Deuteronomy 32:13</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-29.htm">Deuteronomy 33:29</a>, from which David has taken the figure in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/18.htm">Psalm 18</a>, though he has altered the high places of the earth into "my high places" (ba&#770;mo&#772;thai). They were the high places upon which the Lord had placed him, by giving him the victory over his enemies. And Habakkuk uses the figurative expression in the same sense, with the simple change of &#1497;&#1506;&#1502;&#1497;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497; into &#1497;&#1491;&#1512;&#1499;&#1504;&#1497; after <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-29.htm">Deuteronomy 33:29</a>, to substitute for the bestowment of victory the maintenance of victory corresponding to the blessing of Moses. We have therefore to understand ba&#770;mo&#772;thai neither as signifying the high places of the enemy, nor the high places at home, nor high places generally. The figure must be taken as a whole; and according to this, it simply denotes the ultimate triumph of the people of God over all oppression on the part of the power of the world, altogether apart from the local standing which the kingdom of God will have upon the earth, either by the side of or in antagonism to the kingdom of the world. The prophet prays and speaks throughout the entire ode in the name of the believing congregation. His pain is their pain; his joy their joy. Accordingly he closes his ode by appropriating to himself and all believers the promise which the Lord has given to His people and to David His anointed servant, to express the confident assurance that the God of salvation will keep it, and fulfil it in the approaching attack on the part of the power of the world upon the nation which has been refined by the judgment.<p>The last words, &#1500;&#1502;&#1504;&#1510;&#1468;&#1495; &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1490;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;, do not form part of the contents of the supplicatory ode, but are a subscription answering to the heading in <a href="//biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-1.htm">Habakkuk 3:1</a>, and refer to the use of the ode in the worship of God, and simply differ from the headings &#1500;&#1502;&#1504;&#1510;&#1468;&#1495; &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1490;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/4-1.htm">Psalm 4:1-8</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/6-1.htm">Psalm 6:1-10</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/54-1.htm">Psalm 54:1-55:23</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/67-1.htm">Psalm 67:1-7</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/76-1.htm">Psalm 76:1-12</a>, through the use of the suffix in &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1490;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;. Through the words, "to the president (of the temple-music, or the conductor) in accompaniment of my stringed playing," the prophet appoints his psalm for use in the public worship of God accompanied by his stringed playing. Hitzig's rendering is grammatically false, "to the conductor of my pieces of music;" for &#1489; cannot be used as a periphrasis for the genitive, but when connected with a musical expression, only means with or in the accompaniment of (&#1492; instrumenti or concomitantiae). Moreover, &#1504;&#1490;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; does not mean pieces of music, but simply a song, and the playing upon stringed instruments, or the stringed instrument itself (see at <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/4-1.htm">Psalm 4:1-8</a>). The first of these renderings gives no suitable sense here, so that there only remains the second, viz., "playing upon stringed instruments." But if the prophet, by using this formula, stipulates that the ode is to be used in the temple, accompanied by stringed instruments, the expression bing&#305;&#772;no&#772;thai, with my stringed playing, affirms that he himself will accompany it with his own playing, from which it has been justly inferred that he was qualified, according to the arrangements of the Israelitish worship, to take part in the public performance of such pieces of music as were suited for public worship, and therefore belonged to the Levites who were entrusted with the conduct of the musical performance of the temple. </body></html>
