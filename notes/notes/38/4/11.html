Observe, reader, those that would be acquainted with the things of God, must be inquisitive concerning them. They must inquire of those who understand them, and they shall receive information; and if satisfactory answers be not given them at first, or quickly, let them renew their inquiries, praying for light from God, and the vision shall at length <span class="ital">speak, and not lie. </span>The prophet’s second question differs a little, yet not much, from the former.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">I answered again, </span>says he, <span class="ital">What be these two olive-branches? — </span>Two principal branches, one from each tree, extending to the golden candlestick, and communicating to it, <span class="ital">through two golden pipes, </span>fastened to the golden bowl, <span class="ital">the golden oil, out of themselves — </span>That is, the clear, bright oil, the best of its kind, and of great value. <span class="ital">And he answered, Knowest thou not what these be? — </span>If thou knowest the candlestick to be the church, must thou not suppose that the olive-trees and the olive-branches are emblems of the means which God hath provided to communicate to it his truth and grace? The prophet having again acknowledged his ignorance, the angel says, <span class="ital">These are the two anointed ones — </span>Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">בני היצהר</span>, <span class="ital">sons of oil, </span>as in the margin. As by the candlestick we understand the visible church, particularly that of the Jews at that time, for whose comfort this vision was primarily intended, these <span class="ital">sons of oil, that stand by the Lord of the whole earth, </span>are the two great ordinances and offices of the magistracy and ministry, at that time lodged in the hands of those two great and good men, Zerubbabel and Joshua. This prince, this priest, were <span class="ital">sons of oil, </span>anointed of God, or endued with the gifts and graces of his Spirit, to qualify them for the work to which they were called. They stood before the Lord of the whole earth, to minister to him, and to receive direction from him; and a great influence they had upon the affairs of the church at that time; for their wisdom, courage, and zeal were continually emptying themselves into the golden bowl, to keep the lamps burning; and when they should be removed, others would be raised up to carry on the same work, and Israel should not be left without prince and priest. Thus Grotius, Lowth, Henry, Dodd, and several later interpreters, understand the clause. By the <span class="ital">two anointed ones, </span>says Archbishop Newcome, “Zerubbabel and Joshua may be meant; who presided over the temporal and spiritual affairs of the Jews; were the ministers, or vicegerents, of Jehovah; and acted not by their own strength, but by the divine assistance;” <a href="/zechariah/4-6.htm" title="Then he answered and spoke to me, saying, This is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, said the LORD of hosts.">Zechariah 4:6</a>. “It is plain,” adds he, “that the golden candlestick is the Jewish state, both civil and religious: and that the oil, with which the lights are supplied, is the Spirit of God, in opposition to human efforts.” But though the candlestick here may primarily signify the Jewish Church, yet, in a secondary sense, it was also undoubtedly intended to be a figure of the Christian Church; and Zerubbabel and Joshua were types of the Messiah, and their offices emblematical of his offices, who, as is said <a href="/zechariah/6-13.htm" title="Even he shall build the temple of the LORD; and he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule on his throne; and he shall be a priest on his throne: and the counsel of peace shall be between them both.">Zechariah 6:13</a>, <span class="ital">sits and rules upon his throne, </span>and <span class="ital">is a priest upon his throne: </span>who is not only the anointed one himself, but in his mysterious person, as God and man, is the <span class="ital">good olive </span>to his church, supplying it with the golden oil of saving grace, and communicating to believers out of his fulness the unction, or anointing of the Holy Spirit, <a href="/john/1-16.htm" title="And of his fullness have all we received, and grace for grace.">John 1:16</a>; <a href="/context/1_john/2-20.htm" title="But you have an unction from the Holy One, and you know all things....">1 John 2:20-27</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Dr. Blayney, however, gives a different explanation of this passage. By the candlestick, indeed, he understands the church of God, both under the Jewish and Christian dispensations: but, in <a href="/zechariah/4-12.htm" title="And I answered again, and said to him, What be these two olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty the golden oil out of themselves?">Zechariah 4:12</a>, instead of <span class="ital">two olive- branches, </span>he reads, <span class="ital">two orderers of the olive-trees, </span>understanding by the olive-trees “the two dispensations of the law and the gospel, under which were communicated the precious oracles of divine truth, which illuminate the soul, and make men wise unto salvation;” and by the <span class="ital">orderers, </span>or <span class="ital">directors, </span>of these dispensations, Moses and Christ, <span class="ital">the two sons of oil, </span>or <span class="ital">anointed ones, </span>that stand by the Lord of the whole earth, fulfilling his will and executing his commands. “Of the latter of these,” says he, “it is expressly said, <a href="/isaiah/61-1.htm" title="The Spirit of the Lord GOD is on me; because the LORD has anointed me to preach good tidings to the meek; he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound;">Isaiah 61:1</a>, <span class="ital">The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because the Lord hath anointed me, </span>&c. Nor do I conceive that any other can be meant by the two witnesses, appointed to prophesy for a certain time, clothed in sackcloth, <a href="/revelation/11-3.htm" title="And I will give power to my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and three score days, clothed in sackcloth.">Revelation 11:3</a>; the next verse plainly showing, that an allusion is there made to this prophecy of Zechariah, concerning the candlestick and olive-trees, though not with all that accuracy of citation which we should look for at present. <span class="ital">These are the two olive-trees and the two candlesticks, standing before the God of the earth, </span><a href="/revelation/11-4.htm" title="These are the two olive trees, and the two candlesticks standing before the God of the earth.">Revelation 11:4</a>.” <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/zechariah/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:11-14 Zechariah desires to know what are the two olive trees. Zerubbabel and Joshua, this prince and this priest, were endued with the gifts and graces of God's Spirit. They lived at the same time, and both were instruments in the work and service of God. Christ's offices of King and Priest were shadowed forth by them. From the union of these two offices in his person, both God and man, the fullness of grace is received and imparted. They built the temple, the church of God. So does Christ spiritually. Christ is not only the Messiah, the Anointed One himself, but he is the Good Olive to his church; and from his fulness we receive. And the Holy Spirit is the unction or anointing which we have received. From Christ the Olive Tree, by the Spirit the Olive Branch, all the golden oil of grace flows to believers, which keeps their lamps burning. Let us seek, through the intercession and bounty of the Saviour, supplies from that fulness which has hitherto sufficed for all his saints, according to their trials and employments. Let us wait on him in his ordinances, desiring to be sanctified wholly in body, soul, and spirit.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/zechariah/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And I answered and said - The vision, as a whole, had been explained to him. The prophet asks as to subordinate parts, which seemed perhaps inconsistent with the whole. If the whole imports that everything should be done by the Spirit of God, not by human power, what means it that there are these two olive-trees? And when the Angel returned no answer, to invite perhaps closer attention and a more definite question, he asks again; <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/zechariah/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11, 12. Zechariah three times (Zec 4:4, 11, 12) asks as to the two olives before he gets an answer; the question becomes more minute each time. What he at first calls "two olive trees," he afterwards calls "branches," as on closer looking he observes that the "branches" of the trees are the channels through which a continual flow of oil dropped into the bowl of the lamps (Zec 4:2), and that this is the purpose for which the two olive trees stand beside the candlestick. Primarily, the "two" refer to Joshua and Zerubbabel. God, says Auberlen, at each of the transition periods of the world's history has sent great men to guide the Church. So the two witnesses shall appear before the destruction of Antichrist. Antitypically, "the two anointed ones" (Zec 4:14) are the twofold supports of the Church, the civil power (answering to Zerubbabel) and the ecclesiastical (answering to Joshua, the high priest), which in the restored Jewish polity and temple shall "stand by," that is, minister to "the Lord of the whole earth," as He shall be called in the day that He sets up His throne in Jerusalem (Zec 14:9; Da 2:44; Re 11:15). Compare the description of the offices of the "priests" and the "prince" (Isa 49:23; Eze 44:1-46:24). As in Re 11:3, 4, the "two witnesses" are identified with the two olive trees and the two candlesticks. Wordsworth explains them to mean the Law and the Gospel: the two Testaments that witness in the Church for the truth of God. But this is at variance with the sense here, which requires Joshua and Zerubbabel to be primarily meant. So Moses (the prophet and lawgiver) and Aaron (the high priest) ministered to the Lord among the covenant-people at the exodus; Ezekiel (the priest) and Daniel (a ruler) in the Babylonian captivity; so it shall be in restored Israel. Some think Elijah will appear again (compare the transfiguration, Mt 17:3, 11, with Mal 4:4, 5; Joh 1:21) with Moses. Re 11:6, which mentions the very miracles performed by Elijah and Moses (shutting heaven so as not to rain, and turning water into blood), favors this (compare Ex 7:19; 1Ki 17:1; Lu 4:25; Jas 5:16, 17). The period is the same, "three years and six months"; the scene also is in Israel (Re 11:8), "where our Lord was crucified." It is supposed that for the first three and a half years of the hebdomad (Da 9:20-27), God will be worshipped in the temple; in the latter three and a half years, Antichrist will break the covenant (Da 9:27), and set himself up in the temple to be worshipped as God (2Th 2:4). The witnesses prophesy the former three and a half years, while corruptions prevail and faith is rare (Lu 18:8); then they are slain and remain dead three and a half years. Probably, besides individual witnesses and literal years, there is a fulfilment in long periods and general witnesses, such as the Church and the Word, the civil and religious powers so far as they have witnessed for God. So "the beast" in Revelation answers to the civil power of the apostasy; "the false prophet" to the spiritual power. Man needs the priest to atone for guilt, and the prophet-king to teach holiness with kingly authority. These two typically united in Melchisedek were divided between two till they meet in Messiah, the Antitype. Zec 6:11-13 accords with this. The Holy Spirit in this His twofold power of applying to man the grace of the atonement, and that of sanctification, must in one point of view be meant by the two olive trees which supply the bowl at the top of the candlestick (that is, Messiah at the head of the Church); for it is He who filled Jesus with all the fulness of His unction (Joh 3:34). But this does not exclude the primary application to Joshua and Zerubbabel, "anointed" (Zec 4:14) with grace to minister to the Jewish Church: and so applicable to the twofold supports of the Church which are anointed with the Spirit, the prince and the priest, or minister.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/zechariah/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> In this verse the prophet proposeth a question to which no answer is given, but he doth immediately proceed to ask one more question, though somewhat, yet not much, different from the former, and in the answer of this latter question the prophet acquiesceth.

"I heard it, then my belly trembled, at the sound my lips yelled; rottenness forces itself into my bones, and I tremble under myself, that I am to wait quietly for the day of tribulation, when he that attacketh it approacheth the nation. <a href="/habakkuk/3-17.htm">Habakkuk 3:17</a>. For the fig-tree will not blossom, and there is no yield on the vines; the produce of the olive-tree disappoints, and the corn-fields bear no food; the flock is away from the fold, and no ox in the stalls." &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; is not connected with the theophany depicted in <a href="//biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-3.htm">Habakkuk 3:3-15</a>, since this was not an audible phenomenon, but was an object of inward vision, "a spectacle which presented itself to the eye." "I heard" corresponds to "I have heard" in <a href="//biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-2.htm">Habakkuk 3:2</a>, and, like the latter, refers to the report heard from God of the approaching judgment. This address goes back to its starting-point, to explain the impression which it made upon the prophet, and to develop still how he "was afraid." The alarm pervades his whole body, belly, and bones, i.e., the softer and firmer component parts of the body; lips and feet, i.e., the upper and lower organs of the body. The lips cried leqo&#772;l, at the voice, the sound of God, which the prophet heard. Tsa&#770;lal is used elsewhere only of the ringing of the ears (<a href="/1_samuel/3-11.htm">1 Samuel 3:11</a>; <a href="/2_kings/21-12.htm">2 Kings 21:12</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/19-3.htm">Jeremiah 19:3</a>); but here it is applied to the chattering sound produced by the lips, when they smite one another before crying out, not to the chattering of the teeth. Into the bones there penetrates ra&#770;qa&#770;bh, rottenness, inward consumption of the bones, as an effect of alarm or pain, which paralyzes all the powers, and takes away all firmness from the body (cf. <a href="/proverbs/12-4.htm">Proverbs 12:4</a>; <a href="/proverbs/14-30.htm">Proverbs 14:30</a>). Tachtai, under me, i.e., in my lower members, knees, feet: not as in <a href="/exodus/16-29.htm">Exodus 16:29</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-23.htm">2 Samuel 2:23</a>, on the spot where I stand (cf. Ewald, 217, k). &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1488;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; might mean, "I who was to rest;" but it is more appropriate to take 'a&#774;sher as a relative conjunction, "that I," since the clause explains the great fear that had fallen upon him. &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; is used in a similar way viz., as a conjunction with the verb in the first person, in <a href="/ezekiel/29-29.htm">Ezekiel 29:29</a>. Nu&#772;a&#774;ch, to rest, not to rest in the grave (Luther and others), nor to bear quietly or endure (Ges., Maurer), but to wait quietly or silently. For it could hardly occasion such consuming pain to a God-fearing man as that which the prophet experienced, to bear misfortune quietly, when it has already come, and cannot be averted; but it might be to wait quietly and silently, in constant anticipation. Tsa&#770;ra&#770;h, the trouble which the Chaldaeans bring upon Judah. &#1500;&#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514; is not subordinate to &#1500;&#1497;&#1493;&#1501; &#1510;&#1512;&#1492;, but co-ordinate with it, and is still dependent upon &#1488;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;; and &#1497;&#1490;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, as a relative clause (who oppresses it), is the subject to &#1500;&#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514;: "that I am to wait quietly for him that attacketh to approach my nation." For if &#1500;&#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1497; were dependent upon &#1500;&#1497;&#1493;&#1501;, it would be necessary to supply &#1497;&#1493;&#1501; as the subject: "when it (the day) comes." But this is precluded by the fact that &#1506;&#1500;&#1492; is not used for the approach or breaking of day. &#1500;&#1506;&#1501;, to the people, dativ. incomm., is practically equivalent to &#1506;&#1500; &#1506;&#1501;, against the people. &#1506;&#1501;, used absolutely, as in <a href="/isaiah/26-11.htm">Isaiah 26:11</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/42-6.htm">Isaiah 42:6</a>, is the nation of Israel. Gu&#772;d, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/49-19.htm">Genesis 49:19-20</a>, i.e., ga&#770;dad, to press upon a person, to attack him, or crowd together against him (cf. <a href="/psalms/94-21.htm">Psalm 94:21</a>). In <a href="/habakkuk/3-17.htm">Habakkuk 3:17</a> the trouble of this day is described; and the sensation of pain, in the anticipation of the period of calamity, is thereby still further accounted for. The plantations and fields yield no produce. Folds and stalls are empty in consequence of the devastation of the land by the hostile troops and their depredations: "a prophetic picture of the devastation of the holy land by the Chaldaean war" (Delitzsch). Fig-tree and vine are mentioned as the noblest fruit-trees of the land, as is frequently the case (see <a href="/joel/1-7.htm">Joel 1:7</a>; <a href="/hosea/2-14.htm">Hosea 2:14</a>; <a href="/micah/4-4.htm">Micah 4:4</a>). To this there is added the olive-tree, as in <a href="/micah/6-15.htm">Micah 6:15</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/6-11.htm">Deuteronomy 6:11</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-8.htm">Deuteronomy 8:8</a>, etc. Ma&#8219;ase&#772;h zayith is not the shoot, but the produce or fruit of the olive-tree, after the phrase &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1508;&#1512;&#1497;, to bear fruit. Kiche&#772;sh, to disappoint, namely the expectation of produce, as in <a href="/hosea/9-2.htm">Hosea 9:2</a>. Shede&#772;mo&#770;th, which only occurs in the plural, corn-fields, is construed here as in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/16-8.htm">Isaiah 16:8</a>, with the verb in the singular, because, so far as the sense was concerned, it had become almost equivalent to sa&#770;deh, the field (see Ewald, 318, a). Ga&#770;zar, to cut off, used here in a neuter sense: to be cut off or absent. &#1502;&#1499;&#1500;&#1492;, contracted from &#1502;&#1499;&#1500;&#1488;&#1492;: fold, pen, an enclosed place for sheep.
