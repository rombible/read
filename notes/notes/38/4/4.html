He saw what these things were, but inquired what they signified. It is very desirable to know the meaning of God’s manifestations of himself, and of his mind, both in his word and by his ordinances and providences. <span class="ital">The angel answered, &c., Knowest thou not what these be?</span> — This might be said, not with a view of reflecting on the prophet’s want of discernment, but merely to excite his attention: so Capellus observes. Blayney, however, thinks that, by this question, the angel meant to censure the prophet’s dulness in not perceiving “what a reasoning and reflecting mind, versed in the allegories of prophecy, might in some measure at least have discovered.” Thus also Henry: “If he had considered and compared spiritual things with spiritual, he might have guessed at the meaning of these things: for he knew that there was a golden candlestick in the tabernacle, which it was the priest’s constant business to supply with oil, and to keep it burning; when, therefore, he saw in vision such a candlestick, with lamps always burning, and yet no priests to attend it, nor any occasion for them, he might discern the meaning of this to be, that though God had set up the priesthood again, yet he could carry on his own work for and in his people without them.” <span class="ital">And I said, No, my lord — </span>He makes an ingenuous confession of his ignorance.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/zechariah/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:1-7 The prophet's spirit was willing to attend, but the flesh was weak. We should beg of God that, whenever he speaks to us, he would awaken us, and we should then stir up ourselves. The church is a golden candlestick, or lamp-bearer, set up for enlightening this dark world, and holding forth the light of Divine revelation. Two olive trees were seen, one on each side the candlestick, from which oil flowed into the bowl without ceasing. God brings to pass his gracious purposes concerning his church, without any art or labour of man; sometimes he makes use of his instruments, yet he needs them not. This represented the abundance of Divine grace, for the enlightening and making holy the ministers and members of the church, and which cannot be procured or prevented by any human power. The vision assures us that the good work of building the temple, should be brought to a happy end. The difficulty is represented as a great mountain. But all difficulties shall vanish, and all the objections be got over. Faith will remove mountains, and make them plains. Christ is our Zerubbabel; mountains of difficulty were in the way of his undertaking, but nothing is too hard for him. What comes from the grace of God, may, in faith, be committed to the grace of God, for he will not forsake the work of his own hands.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/zechariah/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Osorius: "Awakened from his state of sleep, even thus the prophet seemed slowly to understand what was shown him.

To strengthen the thought, the noun &#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492; is written before the verb instead of the inf. abs. (cf. <a href="/micah/1-11.htm">Micah 1:11</a>). The bow is made bare, not by the shooting of the arrows, but by its covering (&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;, corytus) being removed, in order to use it as a weapon. The reference is to the bow used in war, which God carries as a warrior; so that we are not to think of the rainbow, even if the chariots might be understood as signifying the clouds, as in <a href="/isaiah/19-1.htm">Isaiah 19:1</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/104-3.htm">Psalm 104:3</a>, since the rainbow is a sign of peace and of the covenant, whereas God is represented as attacking His enemies. The next clause, &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514; &#1502;&#1496;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;, is very obscure, and has not yet been satisfactorily explained. Of the two meanings which may be given to matto&#772;th, viz., branches, rods, or staffs, and tribes of the people of Israel, the latter can hardly be thought of here, since matto&#772;th would certainly have been defined by either a suffix or some determining clause, if the tribes of Israel were intended. On the other hand, the meaning staffs or sticks is very naturally suggested both by the context - viz. the allusion to the war-bow - and also by <a href="//biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-14.htm">Habakkuk 3:14</a>, where matt&#305;&#772;m unquestionably signifies staves or lances. At the same time, the meaning spears or darts cannot be deduced from either <a href="/habakkuk/3-14.htm">Habakkuk 3:14</a> or <a href="/2_samuel/18-14.htm">2 Samuel 18:14</a>. In both passages the meaning staves, used as lances or weapons, is quite sufficient. Matteh, a stick or staff with which blows were struck, might stand, as an instrument of chastisement, for the punishment or chastisement itself (cf. <a href="/isaiah/9-3.htm">Isaiah 9:3</a>; <a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5</a>), and in <a href="/micah/6-9.htm">Micah 6:9</a> it denotes the rod. &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514; may be either the plural construct of &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;, the seventh, the heptad, or the plural of &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492;, an oath, or the passive participle of &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506;, to be sworn, like &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506;&#1497; &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514; in <a href="/ezekiel/21-23.htm">Ezekiel 21:23</a>. There is no material difference in the meaning obtained from the last two; and the view we take of the word &#1488;&#1502;&#1512; must decide between them and the first explanation. This word, which is peculiar to poetry, denotes a discourse or a word, and in <a href="/job/22-28.htm">Job 22:28</a> the affair, or the occasion, like &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;. Here, at any rate, it signifies the address or word of God, as in <a href="/psalms/68-12.htm">Psalm 68:12</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/77-9.htm">Psalm 77:9</a>, and is either a genitive dependent upon matto&#772;th or an adverbial accusative. The Masoretic pointing, according to which matto&#772;th is separated from 'o&#772;mer by tiphchah, and the latter joined to sela&#770;h by munach, is connected with the evidently false rabbinical rendering of selah as eternity (in sempiternum), and being decidedly erroneous, cannot be taken into consideration at all. But the interpretation of &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514; as the seventh, does not suit either of these two possible views of 'o&#772;mer. We therefore prefer the second meaning, chastising rods or chastisements. &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;, however, cannot be a genitive dependent upon matto&#772;th; since chastisements of speech would hardly stand for chastisements which God had spoken, but, according to the analogy of &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1496; &#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493; in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/11-4.htm">Isaiah 11:4</a>, would point to chastisements consisting in words, and this does not agree with the present train of thought. 'Omer is rather an adverbial accusative, and belongs to &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514;, indicating the instrument or media employed in the swearing: sworn with the word or through the word, like &#1495;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1498; in <a href="/psalms/17-13.htm">Psalm 17:13</a> (for the use of the accusative to describe the substance or the instrumental medium of an action, see Ewald, 282, c).<p>Hence &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514; cannot be a noun, but must be a passive participle, sworn. The expression, "chastising rods (chastisements) are sworn through the word," points to the solemn oath with which God promised in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-40.htm">Deuteronomy 32:40-42</a> to take vengeance upon His enemies, and avenge the blood of His servants: "For I lift up my hand to heaven, and say, As I live for ever, when I have sharpened my glittering sword, and my hand grasps for judgment, I will render vengeance to mine adversaries, and repay them that hate me. I will make mine arrows drunk with blood, and my sword will eat flesh; from the blood of the slain and the captives, from the hairy head of the enemy." That Habakkuk had in his mind this promise of the vengeance of God upon His enemies, which is strengthened by a solemn oath, is unmistakeably evident, if we compare &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1511; &#1495;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514;&#1498; in <a href="/habakkuk/3-11.htm">Habakkuk 3:11</a> with &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1511; &#1495;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497; in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-41.htm">Deuteronomy 32:41</a>, and observe the allusion in &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; &#1502;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; and &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1494;&#1493; in <a href="/habakkuk/3-13.htm">Habakkuk 3:13</a> and <a href="/habakkuk/3-14.htm">Habakkuk 3:14</a> to &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514; &#1488;&#1493;&#1497;&#1489; in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-42.htm">Deuteronomy 32:42</a>. From this promise the words of the prophet, which are so enigmatical in themselves, obtain the requisite light to render them intelligible. Gesenius (Thes. p. 877) has explained the prophet's words in a similar manner, jurejurando firmatae sunt castigationes promissae (the threatened rods, i.e., chastisements, are sworn), even without noticing the allusion to <a href="/deuteronomy/32-40.htm">Deuteronomy 32:40</a>. upon which these words are founded. Delitzsch was the first to call attention to the allusion to <a href="/deuteronomy/32-40.htm">Deuteronomy 32:40</a>.; but in his explanation, "the darts are sworn through his word of power (jurejurando adstricta sunt tela verbo tuo)," the swearing is taken in a sense which is foreign to Deuteronomy, and therefore conceals the connection with the original passage. Of the other explanations not one can be vindicated. The rabbinical view which we find in the Vulgate, juramenta tribubus quae locutus es, is overthrown by the fact that &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514; without a preposition cannot mean per, or ob, or juxta juramenta, as we should have to render it, and as Luther actually has rendered it in his version ("as Thou hadst sworn to the tribes"). Ewald's rendering, "sevenfold darts of the word," is precluded by the combination of ideas, "darts of the word," which is quite foreign to the context. According to our explanation, the passage does indeed form simply a parenthesis in the description of the judicial interposition of God, but it contains a very fitting thought, through which the description gains in emphasis. In the last clause of the verse the description is continued in the manner already begun, and the effect indicated, which is produced upon the world of nature by the judicial interposition of God: "Thou splittest the earth into rivers." &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1506; is construed with a double accusative, as in <a href="/zechariah/14-4.htm">Zechariah 14:4</a>. This may be understood either as signifying that the earth trembles at the wrath of the Judge, and rents arise in consequence, through which rivers of water burst forth from the deep, or so that at the quaking of the earth the sea pours its waves over the land and splits it into rivers. The following verses point to an earthquake through which the form of the earth's surface is changed. </body></html>
