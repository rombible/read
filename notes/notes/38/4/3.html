We should beg of God that, whenever he speaks to us, he would awaken us, and we should then stir up ourselves. The church is a golden candlestick, or lamp-bearer, set up for enlightening this dark world, and holding forth the light of Divine revelation. Two olive trees were seen, one on each side the candlestick, from which oil flowed into the bowl without ceasing. God brings to pass his gracious purposes concerning his church, without any art or labour of man; sometimes he makes use of his instruments, yet he needs them not. This represented the abundance of Divine grace, for the enlightening and making holy the ministers and members of the church, and which cannot be procured or prevented by any human power. The vision assures us that the good work of building the temple, should be brought to a happy end. The difficulty is represented as a great mountain. But all difficulties shall vanish, and all the objections be got over. Faith will remove mountains, and make them plains. Christ is our Zerubbabel; mountains of difficulty were in the way of his undertaking, but nothing is too hard for him. What comes from the grace of God, may, in faith, be committed to the grace of God, for he will not forsake the work of his own hands.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/zechariah/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And I said, I have looked and behold a candlestick all of gold - The candlestick is the seven-branched candlestick of the tabernacle <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/25-31.htm">Exodus 25:31</a>, but with variations purposely introduced to symbolize the fuller and more constant supply of the oil, itself the symbol of God's Holy Spirit, who:<p>"Enables with perpetual light<p>The dullness of our blinded sight."<p>The first variation is "her bowl on the top of the candlestick," containing the oil; then (as dependent on this) the pipes to derive the oil into each lamp, "seven several  pipes to the seven lamps," that is, seven to each; and the two olive trees on either side of the bowl, whose extreme and fine branches poured through two golden pipes the golden oil into the bowl which supplied the lamp. The multiplied conduits imply the large and perfect supply of oil unceasingly supplied, the seven being symbolic of perfection or of the reconciling of God (symbolized by 3) unto the world (symbolized by 4, its four quarters); the spontaneous flow of the golden oil from the olive trees symbolizes the free gift of God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/zechariah/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. two olive trees&#8212;supplying oil to the bowl.

"Was it against rivers, O Jehovah, against the rivers that Thy wrath was kindled? that Thou ridest hither upon Thy horses, Thy chariots of salvation. <a href="/habakkuk/3-9.htm">Habakkuk 3:9</a>. Thy bow lays itself bare; rods are sworn by word. Selah. Thou splittest the earth into rivers." The ode, taking a new turn, now passes from the description of the coming of God, to an address to God Himself. To the mental eye of the prophet, God presents Himself as Judge of the world, in the threatening attitude of a warlike hero equipped for conflict, so that he asks Him what is the object of His wrath. The question is merely a poetical turn given to a lively composition, which expects no answer, and is simply introduced to set forth the greatness of the wrath of God, so that in substance it is an affirmation. The wrath of God is kindled over the rivers, His fury over the sea. The first clause of the question is imperfect; Jehovah is not the subject, but a vocative, or an appeal, since cha&#770;ra&#770;h, when predicated of God, is construed with &#1500;. The subject follows in the double clause, into which the question divides itself, in &#1488;&#1508;&#1468;&#1498; and &#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1514;&#1498;. Here the indefinite &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; is defined by &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;. Hanneha&#770;r&#305;&#772;m, the rivers, are not any particular rivers, such as the arms of the Nile in Lower Egypt, or the rivers of Ethiopia, the Nile and Astaboras, the naha&#774;re&#772; Khu&#772;sh (<a href="/isaiah/18-1.htm">Isaiah 18:1</a>; <a href="/zephaniah/3-10.htm">Zephaniah 3:10</a> : see Delitzsch), but the rivers of the earth generally; and "the sea" (hayya&#770;m) is not the Red Sea, but the world-sea, as in <a href="/nahum/1-4.htm">Nahum 1:4</a> (cf. <a href="/psalms/89-10.htm">Psalm 89:10</a>; <a href="/job/38-8.htm">Job 38:8</a>). It is true that this description rests upon the two facts of the miraculous dividing of the Red Sea and of the Jordan (<a href="/exodus/15-18.htm">Exodus 15:18</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/114-3.htm">Psalm 114:3</a>, <a href="/psalms/114-5.htm">Psalm 114:5</a>); but it rises far above these to a description of God as the Judge of the world, who can smite in His wrath not only the sea of the world, but all the rivers of the earth. &#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1492; is stronger than &#1488;&#1507;, the wrath which passes over, or breaks through every barrier. K&#305;&#772;, quod, explaining and assigning the reason for the previous question. The riding upon horses is not actual riding, but driving in chariots with horses harnessed to them, as the explanatory words "thy chariots" (&#1502;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1514;&#1497;&#1498;) clearly shows, and as ra&#770;khabh (to ride) always signifies when predicated of God (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/33-26.htm">Deuteronomy 33:26</a>; <a href="/psalms/68-34.htm">Psalm 68:34</a>; <a href="/psalms/104-3.htm">Psalm 104:3</a>). Yeshu&#772;&#8219;a&#770;h is governed by markebho&#772;thekha&#770;, with the freedom of construction allowed in poetry, as in <a href="/2_samuel/22-33.htm">2 Samuel 22:33</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/71-7.htm">Psalm 71:7</a>, whereas in prose the noun is generally repeated in the construct state (vid., <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/37-23.htm">Genesis 37:23</a>, and Ewald, 291, b). Yeshu&#772;&#8219;a&#770;h signifies salvation, even in this case, and not victory, - a meaning which it never has, and which is all the more inapplicable here, because yeshu&#772;&#8219;a&#770;h is interpreted in <a href="/habakkuk/3-13.htm">Habakkuk 3:13</a> by &#1500;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;. By describing the chariots of God as chariots of salvation, the prophet points at the outset to the fact, that the riding of God has for its object the salvation or deliverance of His people. </body></html>
