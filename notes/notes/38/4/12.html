Zerubbabel and Joshua, this prince and this priest, were endued with the gifts and graces of God's Spirit. They lived at the same time, and both were instruments in the work and service of God. Christ's offices of King and Priest were shadowed forth by them. From the union of these two offices in his person, both God and man, the fullness of grace is received and imparted. They built the temple, the church of God. So does Christ spiritually. Christ is not only the Messiah, the Anointed One himself, but he is the Good Olive to his church; and from his fulness we receive. And the Holy Spirit is the unction or anointing which we have received. From Christ the Olive Tree, by the Spirit the Olive Branch, all the golden oil of grace flows to believers, which keeps their lamps burning. Let us seek, through the intercession and bounty of the Saviour, supplies from that fulness which has hitherto sufficed for all his saints, according to their trials and employments. Let us wait on him in his ordinances, desiring to be sanctified wholly in body, soul, and spirit.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/zechariah/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>What are the two spikes of the olive? - Comparing the extreme branches of the olive-tree, laden with their fruit, to the ears of corn, which "were by or in the hand of  the golden pipes, which empty forth the golden oil from themselves." Zechariah's expression, in the hand of or, if so be, by the hand of the two pipes, shows that these two were symbols of living agents, for it is nowhere, used except of a living agent, or of that which it personified as such. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/zechariah/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. through&#8212;literally, "by the hand of," that is, by the agency of.<p>branches&#8212;literally, "ears"; so the olive branches are called, because as ears are full of grain, so the olive branches are full of olives.<p>golden oil&#8212;literally, "gold," that is, gold-like liquor.<p>out of themselves&#8212;Ordinances and ministers are channels of grace, not the grace itself.

Before he could have an answer to the former question, he puts the following, as being of the same import: <p>What be these two olive branches; which grew upon the olive trees, and were nearest to the candlestick, and the pipes that were to the lamps: these, in <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/4-14.htm">Zechariah 4:14</a>, are interpreted of the two anointed ones, or sons of oil, and may design the ministers of the word, if, by the "golden oil" after mentioned, is meant the Gospel; even a set of evangelical preachers in Gospel times, in the various periods of the church; Christ's faithful witnesses, who stand on each side of the bowl, and receive out of Christ's fulness gifts and grace to fit them for their work; and on each side of the candlestick, the church, to impart the oil of the Gospel to it. These may be compared to "olive trees" for their beauty and comeliness in the eyes of saints, to whom they bring the good news of salvation by Christ, <a href="/hosea/14-6.htm">Hosea 14:6</a> and for their greenness and flourishing condition, being filled with the gifts and graces of the Spirit, <a href="/psalms/52-8.htm">Psalm 52:8</a> and for their fruitfulness; for, as the olive tree produces an oil used both for light and food, so they bring the Gospel with them, which is the means of spiritual light, and contains in it refreshing and delightful food, <a href="/deuteronomy/8-8.htm">Deuteronomy 8:8</a> and for their fatness, with which they honour God and men, <a href="/judges/9-9.htm">Judges 9:9</a> so ministers of the Gospel honour Jehovah, Father, Son, and Spirit, by ascribing the contrivance, obtaining, and application of salvation to each of them; and they honour men, by acquainting them what honour all the saints have through Christ, being made kings and priests by him; and by showing them what honour they shall have hereafter. And they may be compared to "olive branches", with respect to Christ the good olive tree, in whom they are as branches; are bore by him, and subsist in him; receive all they have from him, and do all they do in his strength: and also for their tenderness and weakness in themselves, and for their fruitfulness from him. <p>Which through the two golden pipes empty the golden oil out of themselves? if by the "two" olive trees and branches, or anointed ones, ministers of the Gospel are intended; then, by the "golden oil", is meant, not the Spirit and his grace, which is sometimes compared to oil; nor inward spiritual joy and peace, the oil of gladness, for ministers cannot communicate either of these to others; but the Gospel, and the precious truths of it, compared to "oil", because of a healing, cheering, and refreshing nature; and because beautifying, feeding, and fattening; and because of a searching and penetrating nature, and being pure, unmixed, and good for light: and to "golden" oil, or oil, that, being poured out, is like liquid gold, for colour, value, splendour, purity, and duration: and this they "empty out"; which phrase denotes the fulness of the blessing of the Gospel they come with; their free and ready delivery of it; their faithfulness in giving out all, and keeping back nothing that may be profitable; and their ease and satisfaction of mind in so doing and this they do, not out of the corrupt fountains of moral philosophy; nor from the writings of others; nor out of their own heads, or from mere notional knowledge; but out of their hearts, and from their inward experience of Gospel truths; and which is not to be understood exclusive of Christ, or of the Scriptures of truth, from whence they fetch all truth; nor have they this knowledge and experience of or from themselves. The means by which they communicate the golden oil of the Gospel are "the two golden pipes", the ministry of the word, and administration of ordinances; which are like "pipes" or canals, through which Gospel grace is conveyed; and are "golden", are valuable, to be kept pure, and are durable; they are but "pipes", or means, and not to be depended on, yet they are "golden", and not to be despised. But if by the two olive trees, or anointed ones, are meant two divine Persons, of which see <a href="/zechariah/4-14.htm">Zechariah 4:14</a> then by the "golden oil" may be intended the grace of God, often compared to "oil" in Scripture, in allusion to oil in common, or to the anointing oil, which was made of precious spices; or rather, as here, to the lamp oil for the candlestick in the tabernacle, which was pure oil olive: grace, like oil, is of a cheering and refreshing nature, hence called "oil of gladness"; very beautifying and adorning; like oil, it makes the face to shine; and by it the church, and all believers, become "all glorious within": it is of a searching nature; like oil, it penetrates into the heart, and has its seat there; and as oil will not mix with other liquid, so neither will grace with sin and corruption: but chiefly, as here, may it be compared to oil olive, because it burns and gives light, as that does in the lamp. The lamp of a profession, without the oil of grace, is a dark and useless thing. Grace is a light in the inward parts, and causes the light of an outward conversation to shine in good works before men; and this may be truly called "golden", being exceeding valuable, yea, much more precious than gold that perisheth; it being as durable, nay, much more durable than that, for it will last for ever, and can never be lost; see <a href="/1_peter/1-7.htm">1 Peter 1:7</a> and of this the word and ordinances are the means; and so may be designed by the pipes, through which it is conveyed to the souls of men; for "faith", and other graces of the Spirit, "come by hearing, and hearing by the word of God", <a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a> hence says the apostle to the Galatians, <a href="//biblehub.com/galatians/3-2.htm">Galatians 3:2</a>, "received ye the Spirit"; that is, the special gifts and graces of the Spirit, comparable to the best oil and purest gold; "by the works of the law", or through the preaching of that, through the doctrine of justification by the works of it, "or by the hearing of faith?" by the doctrine of justification by faith in the righteousness of Christ, or by the Gospel preached and heard: this is the usual way in which the Spirit and his grace are communicated to men; hence the Gospel is called the "Spirit", and "the ministration of the Spirit", <a href="/2_corinthians/3-6.htm">2 Corinthians 3:6</a> and this seems to be a further confirmation of this sense of the words, since this golden oil is distinct from the pipes through which it flows; as grace is from the Gospel, through which it is received; whereas, in the other sense, they seem to coincide. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/zechariah/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And I answered again, and said unto him, What be these two olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty the golden oil out of themselves?</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/zechariah/4.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">12</span>. <span class="ital">olive branches</span>] Having seen the vision (1–3), and received a general explanation of it (4–10), Zechariah now desires a further explanation of one particular feature (11–14).

"I heard it, then my belly trembled, at the sound my lips yelled; rottenness forces itself into my bones, and I tremble under myself, that I am to wait quietly for the day of tribulation, when he that attacketh it approacheth the nation. <a href="/habakkuk/3-17.htm">Habakkuk 3:17</a>. For the fig-tree will not blossom, and there is no yield on the vines; the produce of the olive-tree disappoints, and the corn-fields bear no food; the flock is away from the fold, and no ox in the stalls." &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; is not connected with the theophany depicted in <a href="//biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-3.htm">Habakkuk 3:3-15</a>, since this was not an audible phenomenon, but was an object of inward vision, "a spectacle which presented itself to the eye." "I heard" corresponds to "I have heard" in <a href="//biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-2.htm">Habakkuk 3:2</a>, and, like the latter, refers to the report heard from God of the approaching judgment. This address goes back to its starting-point, to explain the impression which it made upon the prophet, and to develop still how he "was afraid." The alarm pervades his whole body, belly, and bones, i.e., the softer and firmer component parts of the body; lips and feet, i.e., the upper and lower organs of the body. The lips cried leqo&#772;l, at the voice, the sound of God, which the prophet heard. Tsa&#770;lal is used elsewhere only of the ringing of the ears (<a href="/1_samuel/3-11.htm">1 Samuel 3:11</a>; <a href="/2_kings/21-12.htm">2 Kings 21:12</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/19-3.htm">Jeremiah 19:3</a>); but here it is applied to the chattering sound produced by the lips, when they smite one another before crying out, not to the chattering of the teeth. Into the bones there penetrates ra&#770;qa&#770;bh, rottenness, inward consumption of the bones, as an effect of alarm or pain, which paralyzes all the powers, and takes away all firmness from the body (cf. <a href="/proverbs/12-4.htm">Proverbs 12:4</a>; <a href="/proverbs/14-30.htm">Proverbs 14:30</a>). Tachtai, under me, i.e., in my lower members, knees, feet: not as in <a href="/exodus/16-29.htm">Exodus 16:29</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-23.htm">2 Samuel 2:23</a>, on the spot where I stand (cf. Ewald, 217, k). &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1488;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; might mean, "I who was to rest;" but it is more appropriate to take 'a&#774;sher as a relative conjunction, "that I," since the clause explains the great fear that had fallen upon him. &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; is used in a similar way viz., as a conjunction with the verb in the first person, in <a href="/ezekiel/29-29.htm">Ezekiel 29:29</a>. Nu&#772;a&#774;ch, to rest, not to rest in the grave (Luther and others), nor to bear quietly or endure (Ges., Maurer), but to wait quietly or silently. For it could hardly occasion such consuming pain to a God-fearing man as that which the prophet experienced, to bear misfortune quietly, when it has already come, and cannot be averted; but it might be to wait quietly and silently, in constant anticipation. Tsa&#770;ra&#770;h, the trouble which the Chaldaeans bring upon Judah. &#1500;&#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514; is not subordinate to &#1500;&#1497;&#1493;&#1501; &#1510;&#1512;&#1492;, but co-ordinate with it, and is still dependent upon &#1488;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;; and &#1497;&#1490;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, as a relative clause (who oppresses it), is the subject to &#1500;&#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514;: "that I am to wait quietly for him that attacketh to approach my nation." For if &#1500;&#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1497; were dependent upon &#1500;&#1497;&#1493;&#1501;, it would be necessary to supply &#1497;&#1493;&#1501; as the subject: "when it (the day) comes." But this is precluded by the fact that &#1506;&#1500;&#1492; is not used for the approach or breaking of day. &#1500;&#1506;&#1501;, to the people, dativ. incomm., is practically equivalent to &#1506;&#1500; &#1506;&#1501;, against the people. &#1506;&#1501;, used absolutely, as in <a href="/isaiah/26-11.htm">Isaiah 26:11</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/42-6.htm">Isaiah 42:6</a>, is the nation of Israel. Gu&#772;d, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/49-19.htm">Genesis 49:19-20</a>, i.e., ga&#770;dad, to press upon a person, to attack him, or crowd together against him (cf. <a href="/psalms/94-21.htm">Psalm 94:21</a>). In <a href="/habakkuk/3-17.htm">Habakkuk 3:17</a> the trouble of this day is described; and the sensation of pain, in the anticipation of the period of calamity, is thereby still further accounted for. The plantations and fields yield no produce. Folds and stalls are empty in consequence of the devastation of the land by the hostile troops and their depredations: "a prophetic picture of the devastation of the holy land by the Chaldaean war" (Delitzsch). Fig-tree and vine are mentioned as the noblest fruit-trees of the land, as is frequently the case (see <a href="/joel/1-7.htm">Joel 1:7</a>; <a href="/hosea/2-14.htm">Hosea 2:14</a>; <a href="/micah/4-4.htm">Micah 4:4</a>). To this there is added the olive-tree, as in <a href="/micah/6-15.htm">Micah 6:15</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/6-11.htm">Deuteronomy 6:11</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-8.htm">Deuteronomy 8:8</a>, etc. Ma&#8219;ase&#772;h zayith is not the shoot, but the produce or fruit of the olive-tree, after the phrase &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1508;&#1512;&#1497;, to bear fruit. Kiche&#772;sh, to disappoint, namely the expectation of produce, as in <a href="/hosea/9-2.htm">Hosea 9:2</a>. Shede&#772;mo&#770;th, which only occurs in the plural, corn-fields, is construed here as in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/16-8.htm">Isaiah 16:8</a>, with the verb in the singular, because, so far as the sense was concerned, it had become almost equivalent to sa&#770;deh, the field (see Ewald, 318, a). Ga&#770;zar, to cut off, used here in a neuter sense: to be cut off or absent. &#1502;&#1499;&#1500;&#1492;, contracted from &#1502;&#1499;&#1500;&#1488;&#1492;: fold, pen, an enclosed place for sheep. Repheth, &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;., the rack, then the stable or stall. </body></html>
