This one concerns his colleague Zerubbabel, the representative of civil power, as he of ecclesiastical, and promises that he shall succeed in rebuilding the Temple. The supposition is natural that the actual work of reconstruction was mainly in the hands of the secular ruler.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Flesh is weak, and the Prophet had fallen into deep sleep, after the tension of the previous vision. That had been shown him by Jehovah, but in this vision we have the same angel interpreter who had spoken with Zechariah before. He does not bring the vision, but simply wakes the Prophet that he may see it, and directs his attention to it by the question, ‘What seest thou?’ The best way to teach is to make the learner put his conceptions into definite words. We see things more clearly, and they make a deeper impression, when we tell what we see. How many lazy looks we give at things temporal as well as at things eternal, after which we should be unable to answer the Angel’s question! It is not every one who sees what he looks at.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The passage has two parts-the vision and its interpretation, with related promises.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The vision may be briefly disposed of. Its original is the great lamp which stood in the tabernacle, and was replaced in the Solomonic Temple by ten smaller ones. These had been carried away at the Captivity, and we do not read of their restoration. But the main thing to note is the differences between this lamp and the one in the tabernacle. The description here confines itself to these: They are three-the ‘bowl’ or reservoir above the lamp, the pipes from it to the seven lights, and the two olive-trees which stood on either side of the lamp and replenished from their branches the supply in the reservoir. The tabernacle lamp had no reservoir, and consequently no pipes, but was fed with oil by the priests. The meaning of the variations, then, is plain. They were intended to express the fuller and more immediately divine supply of oil. If the Revised Version’s rendering of the somewhat doubtful numerals in <a href="/zechariah/4-2.htm" title="And said to me, What see you? And I said, I have looked, and behold a candlestick all of gold, with a bowl on the top of it, and his seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes to the seven lamps, which are on the top thereof:">Zechariah 4:2</a> be accepted, each several light had seven pipes, thus expressing the perfection of its supplies.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Now, there can be no doubt about the symbolism of the tabernacle lamp. It represented the true office of Israel, as it rayed out its beams into the darkness of the desert. It meant the same thing as Christ’s words, ‘Ye are the light of the world,’ and as the vision of the seven golden candlesticks, in <a href="/revelation/1-12.htm" title="And I turned to see the voice that spoke with me. And being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks;">Revelation 1:12</a> - <a href="/revelation/1-13.htm" title="And in the middle of the seven candlesticks one like to the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the breasts with a golden girdle.">Revelation 1:13</a>, <a href="/revelation/1-20.htm" title="The mystery of the seven stars which you saw in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks which you saw are the seven churches.">Revelation 1:20</a>. The substitution of separate lamps for one with seven lights may teach the difference between the mere formal unity of the people of God in the Old Testament and the true oneness, conjoined with diversity, in the New Testament Church, which is one because Christ walks in the midst. Zechariah’s lamp, then, called to the minds of the little band of restored exiles their high vocation, and the changed arrangements for the supply of that oil, which is the standing emblem for divine communications fitting for service, or, to keep to the metaphor, fitting to shine, signified the abundance of these.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The explanation of the vision is introduced, as at <a href="/zechariah/1-9.htm" title="Then said I, O my lord, what are these? And the angel that talked with me said to me, I will show you what these be.">Zechariah 1:9</a>, <a href="/zechariah/1-19.htm" title="And I said to the angel that talked with me, What be these? And he answered me, These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.">Zechariah 1:19</a>, by the Prophet’s question of its meaning. His angelic teacher is astonished at his dullness, as indeed heavenly eyes must often be at ours, and asks if he does not know so familiar an object. The Prophet’s ‘No, my Lord,’ brings full explanation. Ingenuously acknowledged ignorance never asks Heaven for enlightenment in vain.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> First, the true source of strength and success, as shown by the vision, is declared in plain terms. What fed the lamp? Oil, which symbolises the gift of a divine Spirit, if not in the full personal sense as in the New Testament, yet certainly as a God-breathed influence, preparing prophets, priests, kings, and even artificers, for their several forms of service. Whence came the oil? From the two olive-trees, which though, as <a href="/zechariah/4-14.htm" title="Then said he, These are the two anointed ones, that stand by the LORD of the whole earth.">Zechariah 4:14</a> shows, they represented the two leaders, yet set forth the truth that their power for their work was from God; for the Bible knows nothing of ‘nature’ as a substitute for or antithesis to God, and the growth of the olive and its yield of oil is His doing.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> This, then, was the message for Zerubbabel and his people, that God would give such gifts as they needed, in order that the light which He Himself had kindled should not be quenched. If the lamp was fed with oil, it would burn, and there would be a Temple for it to stand in. If we try to imagine the feebleness of the handful of discouraged men, and the ring of enemies round them, we may feel the sweetness of the promise which bade them not despond because they had little of what the world calls might.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> We all need the lesson; for the blustering world is apt to make us forget the true source of all real strength for holy service or for noble living. The world’s power at its mightiest is weak, and the Church’s true power, at her feeblest, is omnipotent, if only she grasps the strength which is hers, and takes the Spirit which is given. The eternal antithesis of man’s weakness at his haughtiest, and God’s strength even in its feeblest possessors, is taught by that lamp flaming, whatever envious hands or howling storms might seek to quench it, because fed by oil from on high. Let us keep to God’s strength, and not corrupt His oil with mixtures of foul-smelling stuff of our own compounding.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Next, in the strength of that revelation of the source of might a defiant challenge is blown to the foe. The ‘great mountain’ is primarily the frowning difficulties which lifted themselves against Zerubbabel’s enterprise, and more widely the whole mass of worldly opposition encountered by God’s servants in every age. It seems to bar all advance; but an unseen Hand crushes it down, and flattens it out into a level, on which progress is easy. The Hebrew gives the suddenness and completeness of the transformation with great force; for the whole clause, ‘Thou shalt become a plain,’ is one word in the original.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Such triumphant rising above difficulties is not presumption when it has been preceded by believing gaze on the source of strength. If we have taken to heart the former words of the Prophet, we shall not be in danger of rash overconfidence when we calmly front obstacles in the path of duty, assured that every mountain shall be made low. A brave scorn of the world, both in its sweetnesses and its terrors, befits God’s men, and is apt to fulfil its own confidences; for most of these terrors are like ghosts, who will not wait to be spoken to, but melt away if fairly faced. Nor should we forget the other side of this thought; namely, that it is the constant drift of Providence to abase the lofty in mind, and to raise the lowly. What is high is sure to get many knocks which pass over lower heads. To men of faith every mountain shall either become a plain or be cast into the sea.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Then follows, on the double revelation of the source of strength and the futility of opposition, the assurance of the successful completion of the work. The stone which is to crown the structure shall be brought forth and set in its place amid jubilant prayers not offered in vain, that ‘grace’-that is, the protecting favour of God-may rest on it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The same thought is reiterated and enlarged in the next ‘word,’ which is somewhat separated from the former, as if the flow of prophetic communication had paused for a moment, and then been resumed. In <a href="/zechariah/4-9.htm" title="The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also finish it; and you shall know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you.">Zechariah 4:9</a> we have the assurance, so seldom granted to God’s workers, that Zerubbabel shall be permitted to complete the task which he had begun. It is the fate of most of us to inherit unfinished work from our predecessors, and to bequeath the like to our successors. And in one aspect, all human work is unfinished, as being but a fragment of the fulfilment of the mighty purpose which runs through all the ages. Yet some are more happy than others, in that they see an approximate completion of their work. But whether it be so or not, our task is to ‘do the little we can do, and leave the rest with God,’ sure that He will work all the fragments into a perfect whole, and content to do the smallest bit of service for Him. Few of us are strong enough to do separate building. We are like coral insects, whose reef is one, though its makers are millions.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Zerubbabel finished his task, but its end was but a new beginning of an order of things of which he did not see the end. There are no beginnings or endings, properly speaking, in human affairs, but all is one unbroken flow. One man only has made a real new beginning, and that is Jesus Christ; and He only will really carry His work to its very last issues. He is Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending. He is the Foundation of the true Temple, and He is also the Headstone of the corner, the foundation on which all rests, the apex to which all runs up. ‘When He begins, He will also make an end.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The completion of the work is to be the token that the ‘angel who spake with me’ was God’s messenger. We can know that before the fulfilment, but we cannot but know it after. Better to be sure that the message is from God while yet the certainty is the result of faith, than to be sure of it afterwards, when the issue has shattered and shamed our doubts.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> If we realise that God’s Spirit is the guarantee for the success of work done for God, we shall escape the vulgar error of measuring the importance of things by their size, as, no doubt, many of these builders were doing. No one will help on the day of great things who despises that of small ones. They say that the seeds of the ‘big trees’ in California are the smallest of all the conifers. I do not vouch for the truth of the statement, but God’s work always begins with little seeds, as the history of the Church and of every good cause shows. ‘What do these feeble Jews?’ sneered the spectators of their poor little walls, painfully piled up, over which a fox could jump. They did very little, but they were building the city of God, which has outlasted all the mockers.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Men might look with contempt on the humble beginning, but other eyes than theirs looked at it with other emotions. The eyes which in the last vision were spoken of as directed on the foundation stone, gaze on the work with joy. These are the seven eyes of ‘the Lord,’ which are ‘the seven Spirits of God, sent forth into all the earth’ {<a href="/revelation/5-6.htm" title="And I beheld, and, see, in the middle of the throne and of the four beasts, and in the middle of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.">Revelation 5:6</a>}. The Spirit is here contemplated in the manifoldness of His operations rather than in the unity of His person. Thus the closing assurance, which involves the success of the work, since God’s eyes rest on it with delight, comes round to the first declaration, ‘Not by might, not by power, but by My Spirit.’ Note the strong contrast between ‘despise’ and ‘rejoice.’ What matter the scoffs of mockers, if God approves? What are they but fools who look at that which moves His joy, and find in it only food for scorn? What will become of their laughter at last? If we try to get so near God as to see things with His eyes, we shall be saved from many a false estimate of what is great and what is small, and may have our own poor little doings invested with strange dignity, because He deigns to behold and bless them.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/zechariah/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/zechariah/4-1.htm" title="And the angel that talked with me came again, and waked me, as a man that is wakened out of his sleep....">Zechariah 4:1-3</a></span>. <span class="ital">And the angel came again, and waked me — </span>This seems to indicate, that the prophet’s attention was very deeply engaged by the foregoing vision; that all the powers of his mind were wholly engrossed by it; so that he had even fallen into a kind of trance, or ecstasy, when he was roused again by the angel, to attend to what follows. <span class="ital">And said unto me, What seest thou? — </span>Thus the angel still further excites his attention. <span class="ital">And I said, Behold a candlestick of gold — </span>This represented the church of God, Jewish and Christian, set up for the enlightening of this dark world, by diffusing the light of divine truth. The candle, or lamp, is God’s, the church is but the candlestick; but it is all of gold, signifying the great worth of the church, composed of the excellent of the earth. This golden candlestick had seven lamps, branching out from it by so many sockets, in each of which was a burning and shining light. The Jewish Church was but one; and though the Jews that were dispersed had probably synagogues in other countries, yet they were but as so many lamps belonging to one candlestick; but now, under the gospel, Christ is the centre of unity, and not Jerusalem, or any one place; and, therefore, seven particular churches are represented, not as seven lamps, but as seven several golden candlesticks, <a href="/revelation/1-20.htm" title="The mystery of the seven stars which you saw in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks which you saw are the seven churches.">Revelation 1:20</a>. This candlestick had one <span class="ital">bowl, </span>or common receiver, on the top, into which oil was continually dropping; and from it, by seven pipes or conduits, it was conveyed to the seven lamps; so that without any further care, they received oil as fast as they wasted it, and so were kept always burning. And the bowl too was continually supplied, without any care or attendance of man, <span class="ital">from two olive-trees, </span>(<a href="/zechariah/4-3.htm" title="And two olive trees by it, one on the right side of the bowl, and the other on the left side thereof.">Zechariah 4:3</a>,) one on each side of the candlestick, which were so fat and fruitful, that, of their own accord, they poured plenty of oil continually into the bowl. So that nobody needed to attend to this candlestick, to furnish it with oil; it tarried not for man, nor waited for the sons of men: the scope of which is to show, that God easily can, and often doth, accomplish his gracious purposes concerning his church by his own wisdom and power, without any art or labour of man. And though sometimes he makes use of instruments, yet he neither needs them, nor is confined to them, but can do his work without them, and will, rather than it shall remain undone.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/zechariah/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:1-7 The prophet's spirit was willing to attend, but the flesh was weak. We should beg of God that, whenever he speaks to us, he would awaken us, and we should then stir up ourselves. The church is a golden candlestick, or lamp-bearer, set up for enlightening this dark world, and holding forth the light of Divine revelation. Two olive trees were seen, one on each side the candlestick, from which oil flowed into the bowl without ceasing. God brings to pass his gracious purposes concerning his church, without any art or labour of man; sometimes he makes use of his instruments, yet he needs them not. This represented the abundance of Divine grace, for the enlightening and making holy the ministers and members of the church, and which cannot be procured or prevented by any human power. The vision assures us that the good work of building the temple, should be brought to a happy end. The difficulty is represented as a great mountain. But all difficulties shall vanish, and all the objections be got over. Faith will remove mountains, and make them plains. Christ is our Zerubbabel; mountains of difficulty were in the way of his undertaking, but nothing is too hard for him. What comes from the grace of God, may, in faith, be committed to the grace of God, for he will not forsake the work of his own hands.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/zechariah/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The angel came again - The angel (as before <a href="/zechariah/2-3.htm">Zechariah 2:3</a>) had gone forth to receive some fresh instruction from a higher angel or from God.<p>And awakened me - As a man is awakened out of sleep. Zechariah, overwhelmed by the greatness of the visions, must have sunk down in a sort of stupor, as after the vision of the ram and he-goat, as Gabriel was speaking with him, Daniel says, "I was in a deep sleep on my face toward the ground, and he touched me and set me upright" <a href="/daniel/8-18.htm">Daniel 8:18</a>; and again at the voice of the angel, who, after his three weeks' fast <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/10-9.htm">Daniel 10:9</a>, came to declare to him <a href="/daniel/10-21.htm">Daniel 10:21</a> the scripture of truth; and at the Transfiguration, "Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep, and when they were awake, they saw His glory." <a href="/luke/9-32.htm">Luke 9:32</a>. Osorius: "Wondrous and stupendous mysteries were they which were shown to the divine man.

Nailed then and struck still with amazement, while he revolved these things in his mind, sunk in a sort of sleep, he is borne out of himself and, mantled around with darkness, understands that the secret things of Divine Wisdom cannot be perfectly comprehended by the mind of any. This then he attained that, his senses being overpowered, he should see nothing, save that wherein is the sum of wisdom, that this immensity of the divine excellence cannot be searched out.

Roused by the Interpreting Angel from a sleep or stupor, into which he appears to have fallen, <a href="/zechariah/3-1.htm" title="And he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him.">Zechariah 3:1</a>, the prophet sees a golden candlestick or lamp-stand. Like that originally placed in the Tabernacle, it has seven lamps, but they are fed by a bowl placed above them, from which the oil is conveyed into them by pipes, <a href="/zechariah/4-2.htm" title="And said to me, What see you? And I said, I have looked, and behold a candlestick all of gold, with a bowl on the top of it, and his seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes to the seven lamps, which are on the top thereof:">Zechariah 4:2</a>. The bowl itself is supplied with oil by two olive-trees, standing one on either side of the lamp, which empty their oil into the bowl, each through a golden tube, <a href="/zechariah/4-3.htm" title="And two olive trees by it, one on the right side of the bowl, and the other on the left side thereof.">Zechariah 4:3</a>; <a href="/zechariah/4-12.htm" title="And I answered again, and said to him, What be these two olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty the golden oil out of themselves?">Zechariah 4:12</a>. At the request of Zechariah, <a href="/zechariah/4-4.htm" title="So I answered and spoke to the angel that talked with me, saying, What are these, my lord?">Zechariah 4:4</a>, the Interpreting Angel, with some show of surprise that explanation should be needed, <a href="/zechariah/4-5.htm" title="Then the angel that talked with me answered and said to me, Know you not what these be? And I said, No, my lord.">Zechariah 4:5</a>, explains to him the meaning of the vision. It is intended to encourage Zerubbabel in the work of re-building the Temple, by impressing upon him the truth, that as that candlestick gave forth its light, in silent, ceaseless splendour, unfed and untended by human agencies, so the work in which he was engaged, of restoring the material Temple and setting the golden candlestick in its place again, and so preparing the way, first for the Jewish Church, and then for the Christian Church, which that candlestick symbolised (<a href="/revelation/1-20.htm" title="The mystery of the seven stars which you saw in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks which you saw are the seven churches.">Revelation 1:20</a>), to shine in the world, should be accomplished, not by human resources, but by the Spirit of God, <a href="/zechariah/4-6.htm" title="Then he answered and spoke to me, saying, This is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, said the LORD of hosts.">Zechariah 4:6</a>. The great principle involved in the symbol and thus enunciated is now applied to the case in hand. The mountain of difficulty, which stands in the way of Zerubbabel, shall sink down into a plain. With shouts of festive joy he shall set in its place the crowning stone of the edifice, <a href="/zechariah/4-7.htm" title="Who are you, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel you shall become a plain: and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings, crying, Grace, grace to it.">Zechariah 4:7</a> Yet again, by a repeated assurance conveyed to the prophet through the Angel, <a href="/zechariah/4-8.htm" title="Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,">Zechariah 4:8</a>, Jehovah confirms the promise to Zerubbabel, that his hands which have begun shall complete the work, and prove in doing so the divine mission of the angel, <a href="/zechariah/4-9.htm" title="The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also finish it; and you shall know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you.">Zechariah 4:9</a>. Despicable as it might appear in its feeble beginnings in the sight of man, the eyes of Jehovah, which were not only fixed upon it with unceasing watchfulness (<a href="/zechariah/4-9.htm" title="The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also finish it; and you shall know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you.">Zechariah 4:9</a>), but ran to and fro through the whole earth to take cognisance of and deal with every hindering and every helping influence, rejoiced to see the progress of that house, <a href="/zechariah/4-10.htm" title="For who has despised the day of small things? for they shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel with those seven; they are the eyes of the LORD, which run to and fro through the whole earth.">Zechariah 4:10</a>. Not satisfied with this exposition of its main scope, the prophet asks for information as to some of the details of the vision. What, he would fain know, is the significance of the two olive-trees, <a href="/zechariah/4-11.htm" title="Then answered I, and said to him, What are these two olive trees on the right side of the candlestick and on the left side thereof?">Zechariah 4:11</a>, or yet more precisely, of the two branches of them, which through the two golden tubes empty their oil into the bowl of the lamp, <a href="/zechariah/4-12.htm" title="And I answered again, and said to him, What be these two olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty the golden oil out of themselves?">Zechariah 4:12</a>. The answer, again given with some show of surprise at the question, <a href="/zechariah/4-13.htm" title="And he answered me and said, Know you not what these be? And I said, No, my lord.">Zechariah 4:13</a>, by the Interpreting Angel, is calculated by its obscurity rather to fix attention on the chief lesson of the vision, than to interpret the details to which reference is made. Suffice it to know that the olive trees represent agencies, by which the Lord of the whole earth is pleased to supply the requirements of His Church, <a href="/zechariah/4-14.htm" title="Then said he, These are the two anointed ones, that stand by the LORD of the whole earth.">Zechariah 4:14</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/zechariah/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-14.</span> - 7. <span class="accented">The fifth vision: the golden candlestick.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The angel that talked with me.</span> The interpreting angel is meant. <span class="cmt_word">Came again, and waked me.</span> It is thought that the angel, who is said (<a href="/zechariah/2-3.htm">Zechariah 2:3</a>) to have gone forth, now rejoined the prophet and renewed his colloquy with him. But the expression in the text is probably only equivalent to "aroused me again" (comp. <a href="/genesis/26-18.htm">Genesis 26:18</a>; <a href="/2_kings/1-11.htm">2 Kings 1:11, 13</a>, etc.). Absorbed in awe and wonder at the contemplation of the preceding vision, the prophet had fallen into a state of exhaustion and torpor, as Daniel slept after his great visions (<a href="/daniel/8-18.htm">Daniel 8:18</a>; <a href="/daniel/10-8.htm">Daniel 10:8, 9</a>), and the apostles were heavy with sleep on the Mount of Transfiguration (<a href="/luke/9-32.htm">Luke 9:32</a>). From this mental prostration the angel arouses him to renewed attention. Or what is meant may be that the change wrought on the faculties by the Divine influence was as great as that between natural sleeping and waking. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/habakkuk/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"He stands, and sets the earth reeling: He looks, and makes nations tremble; primeval mountains burst in pieces, the early hills sink down: His are ways of the olden time. <a href="/habakkuk/3-7.htm">Habakkuk 3:7</a>. I saw the tents of Cushan under affliction: the curtains of the land of Midian tremble." God coming from afar has now drawn near and taken His stand, to smite the nations as a warlike hero (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-8.htm">Habakkuk 3:8</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-9.htm">Habakkuk 3:9</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-11.htm">Habakkuk 3:11</a>, <a href="/habakkuk/3-12.htm">Habakkuk 3:12</a>). This is affirmed in &#1506;&#1502;&#1491;, He has stationed Himself, not "He steps forth or appears." This standing of Jehovah throws the earth and the nations into trembling. &#1497;&#1502;&#1491;&#1491; cannot mean to measure here, for there is no thought of any measuring of the earth, and it cannot be shown that ma&#770;dad is used in the sense of measuring with the eye (Ros. and Hitzig). Moreover, the choice of the poel, instead of the piel, would still remain unexplained, and the parallelism of the clauses would be disregarded. We must therefore follow the Chaldee, Ges., Delitzsch, and others, who take &#1502;&#1491;&#1491; as the poel of &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;  equals  &#1496;&#1493;&#1468;&#1496;, to set in a reeling motion. It is only with this interpretation that the two parallel clauses correspond, in which &#1497;&#1514;&#1468;&#1512;, the hiphil of &#1504;&#1514;&#1512;, to cause to shake or tremble, answers to &#1497;&#1502;&#1491;&#1491;. This explanation is also required by what follows. For just as <a href="/habakkuk/3-7.htm">Habakkuk 3:7</a> unquestionably gives a further expansion of &#1497;&#1514;&#1468;&#1512; &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501;, so does &#1500;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501; ... &#1497;&#1514;&#1508;&#1468;&#1510;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468; contain the explanation of &#1497;&#1502;&#1491;&#1491; &#1488;&#1512;&#1509;. The everlasting hills crumble (&#1497;&#1514;&#1508;&#1468;&#1510;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468; from &#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509;), i.e., burst and resolve themselves into dust, and the hills sink down, pass away, and vanish (compare the similar description in <a href="/nahum/1-5.htm">Nahum 1:5</a> and <a href="/micah/1-4.htm">Micah 1:4</a>). &#1492;&#1512;&#1512;&#1497;&#1470;&#1506;&#1491; ( equals  &#1492;&#1512;&#1512;&#1497; &#1511;&#1491;&#1501;, <a href="/deuteronomy/33-15.htm">Deuteronomy 33:15</a>) in parallelism with &#1504;&#1468;&#1489;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514; &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501; are the primeval mountains, as being the oldest and firmest constituents of the globe, which have existed from the beginning (&#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497; &#1506;&#1491;, <a href="/job/20-4.htm">Job 20:4</a>), and were formed at the creation of the earth (<a href="/psalms/90-2.htm">Psalm 90:2</a>; <a href="/job/15-7.htm">Job 15:7</a>; <a href="/proverbs/8-25.htm">Proverbs 8:25</a>). &#1492;&#1500;&#1497;&#1499;&#1493;&#1514; &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501; &#1500;&#1493; is not to be taken relatively, and connected with what precedes, "which are the old paths," according to which the hills of God are called everlasting ways (Hitzig); because this does not yield a sense in harmony with the context. It is a substantive clause, and to be taken by itself: everlasting courses or goings are to Him, i.e., He now goes along, as He went along in the olden time. &#1492;&#1500;&#1497;&#1499;&#1492;, the going, advancing, or ways of God, analogous to the &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; &#1506;&#1508;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501;, the course of the primitive world (<a href="/job/22-15.htm">Job 22:15</a>). The prophet had <a href="/psalms/68-25.htm">Psalm 68:25</a> floating before his mind, in which ha&#774;l&#305;&#772;kho&#772;th 'e&#774;lo&#772;h&#305;&#772;m denote the goings of God with His people, or the ways which God had taken from time immemorial in His guidance of them. As He once came down upon Sinai in the cloudy darkness, the thunder, lightning, and fire, to raise Israel up to be His covenant nation, so that the mountains shook (cf. <a href="/judges/5-5.htm">Judges 5:5</a>); so do the mountains and hills tremble and melt away at His coming now. And as He once went before His people, and the tidings of His wondrous acts at the Red Sea threw the neighbouring nations into fear and despair (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/15-14.htm">Exodus 15:14-16</a>); so now, when the course of God moves from Teman to the Red Sea, the nations on both sides of it are filled with terror. Of these, two are individualized in <a href="//biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-7.htm">Habakkuk 3:7</a>, viz., Cushan and Midian. By Cushan we are not to understand the Mesopotamian king named Cushan Rishathaim, who subjugated Israel for eight years after the death of Joshua (<a href="/judges/3-8.htm">Judges 3:8</a>.); for this neither agrees with &#1488;&#1492;&#1500;&#1497;, nor with the introduction of Midian in the parallel clause. The word is a lengthened form for Such, and the name of the African Ethiopians. The Midianites are mentioned along with them, as being inhabitants of the Arabian coast of the Red Sea, which was opposite to them (see at <a href="/exodus/2-15.htm">Exodus 2:15</a>). &#1488;&#1492;&#1500;&#1497; &#1499;, the tents with their inhabitants, the latter being principally intended. The same remark applies to &#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514;, lit., the tent-curtains of the land of Midian, i.e., of the tents pitched in the land of Midian. </body></html>
