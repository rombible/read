We should beg of God that, whenever he speaks to us, he would awaken us, and we should then stir up ourselves. The church is a golden candlestick, or lamp-bearer, set up for enlightening this dark world, and holding forth the light of Divine revelation. Two olive trees were seen, one on each side the candlestick, from which oil flowed into the bowl without ceasing. God brings to pass his gracious purposes concerning his church, without any art or labour of man; sometimes he makes use of his instruments, yet he needs them not. This represented the abundance of Divine grace, for the enlightening and making holy the ministers and members of the church, and which cannot be procured or prevented by any human power. The vision assures us that the good work of building the temple, should be brought to a happy end. The difficulty is represented as a great mountain. But all difficulties shall vanish, and all the objections be got over. Faith will remove mountains, and make them plains. Christ is our Zerubbabel; mountains of difficulty were in the way of his undertaking, but nothing is too hard for him. What comes from the grace of God, may, in faith, be committed to the grace of God, for he will not forsake the work of his own hands.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/zechariah/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And I said, I have looked and behold a candlestick all of gold - The candlestick is the seven-branched candlestick of the tabernacle <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/25-31.htm">Exodus 25:31</a>, but with variations purposely introduced to symbolize the fuller and more constant supply of the oil, itself the symbol of God's Holy Spirit, who:<p>"Enables with perpetual light<p>The dullness of our blinded sight."<p>The first variation is "her bowl on the top of the candlestick," containing the oil; then (as dependent on this) the pipes to derive the oil into each lamp, "seven several  pipes to the seven lamps," that is, seven to each; and the two olive trees on either side of the bowl, whose extreme and fine branches poured through two golden pipes the golden oil into the bowl which supplied the lamp. The multiplied conduits imply the large and perfect supply of oil unceasingly supplied, the seven being symbolic of perfection or of the reconciling of God (symbolized by 3) unto the world (symbolized by 4, its four quarters); the spontaneous flow of the golden oil from the olive trees symbolizes the free gift of God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/zechariah/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. candlestick&#8212;symbolizing the Jewish theocracy; and ultimately, the Church of which the Jewish portion is to be the head: the light-bearer (so the original is of "lights," Mt 5:14, 16; Php 2:15) to the world.<p>all &#8230; gold&#8212;all pure in doctrine and practice, precious and indestructible; such is the true ideal of the Church; such she shall be (Ps 45:13).<p>bowl upon the top&#8212;In the candlestick of the tabernacle the plural is used, bowls (Ex 25:31).

The greater the number of oil-feeding pipes, the brighter the light of the lamps. The explanation in Zec 4:6 is, that man's power by itself can neither retard nor advance God's work, that the real motive-power is God's Spirit.

This candlestick may primarily respect, and may be an emblem of, the then present state of the Jewish church, when this vision was seen; and point at how it was raised up, restored, and preserved; but has a further view to the church of God, under the Gospel dispensation, unto the end of the world: <p>with a bowl upon the top of it; an oil vessel, or cruet, round, and large enough to hold the oil, which supplied it, and each of its lamps, whereby its light was maintained and continued; and this may intend, either the fulness of grace in Christ, which is as "a fountain", as the word (l) here used signifies, <a href="/joshua/15-19.htm">Joshua 15:19</a> to supply his church and people; and from whence they have the oil of grace in measure, which is in him without measure, whereby their lamps are filled, and their lights are kept burning; and who is fitly placed as the Head of the church for this purpose, as this bowl was upon the top of the candlestick: or rather, since this "bowl" is but a measure, though it may be a large one it may signify that large portion of gifts and grace which is communicated to the church in all ages, and abides in it, and is severally divided to the ministers and members of it, for its profit and edification; to one one gift, to another another; to some greater, and others less; and all for mutual good; and which are given forth from Christ and his Spirit; who, as Capellus thinks, may be meant by the two olive trees, who of themselves, without pressing, having all fulness of grace in them without measure, freely and liberally impart it; and keep filling the bowl, so that there is constantly a supply of the Spirit, and grace for the church and people of Christ in all ages; according to <a href="/isaiah/59-21.htm">Isaiah 59:21</a> "my Spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed's seed saith the Lord, from henceforth, and for ever". Cocceius thinks the merit of Christ is meant by this bowl or cup, by which he obtained the promise of the Spirit: <p>and his seven lamps thereon; on the candlestick; such a number of lamps were on the candlestick in the tabernacle, <a href="/exodus/25-37.htm">Exodus 25:37</a> and may design the many members of the church bearing the lamps of profession; or rather the ministers of the Gospel, who are the lights of the world, and bright and burning ones, that hold forth the word of life both in doctrine and conversation; unless the gifts and graces of the Spirit, qualifying them for such work, should be meant; see <a href="/revelation/4-5.htm">Revelation 4:5</a> but rather ministers themselves are designed, who are called lights and lamps, <a href="/matthew/5-14.htm">Matthew 5:14</a> and the number seven, being a number of perfection, may denote a fulness and sufficiency of Gospel ministers, which Christ furnishes his church with, and will do unto the end of the world; he having a perfection of gifts in his hands for them, to fit them for his service; just as these are called the "seven pillars" of Wisdom's house, <a href="/proverbs/9-1.htm">Proverbs 9:1</a>. Cocceius thinks by these seven lamps are intended the seven churches, or the seven states of the church under several periods in the Gospel dispensation; the same with the seven churches of Asia, and the seven golden candlesticks, in the midst of which Christ was seen by John, <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/1-4.htm">Revelation 1:4</a>, <p>and seven pipes to the seven lamps which were upon the top thereof; these pipes, infusers or funnels, were at the bottom of the bowl, in which were so many holes, that let out the oil into them, by which it was carried to the lamps; a pipe to every lamp. In the Hebrew text it is, "seven and seven pipes" (m); that is, fourteen, two to every lamp; which Fortunatus Scacchus (n) thinks, they being joined to one another, the one put in the neck of the other, were for the better cleansing and purifying of the oil from any dregs that might be in it. Jarchi is of opinion there were seven to every lamp, in all forty nine, but without any foundation: by these are meant, not the seven sacraments, as say the Papists; but either the various gifts of the Spirit, fitting ministers for their service; or the various means they make use of to learn the mind of Christ in the Scriptures, to know the Gospel, and more of it, that they may hold it forth to others; such as reading, meditation, and prayer. <p>(l) "fons", Pembellus; "scaturigo", Sanctius.

This vision of the candlestick, with its seven lamps fed by two olive trees, signifies that the work of rebuilding the temple, and preparing the way for the Church of the true Israel, was to be accomplished by relying, not on human resources, but on Divine aid. Thus were Zerubbabel and his people roused to perseverance and energy in their good work, of which the final sucess is assured. <span class="cmt_word">I have looked;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span> (Septuagint), "I have seen." <span class="cmt_word">A candlestick all of gold</span>.

The single candelabrum of Zerubbabel's temple is mentioned in 1 Macc. 1:21 1 Macc. 4:49, 50. The one sculptured on the arch of Titus may be a truthful representation of that in Herod's temple, but probably is not the same as that in the second edifice (comp. Josephus, 'Ant.,' 14:04, 4). The candelabrum in the vision differed from the original one in three particulars: it had a central reservoir; it had also seven pipes; and it was supplied with oil by two olive trees. <span class="cmt_word">With a</span> (<span class="accented">its</span>) <span class="cmt_word">howl upon the top of it.</span> The "bowl" (<span class="accented">gullah</span>) is a reservoir for oil placed at the top of the candelabrum; and from it tubes led the oil for the supply of the lamps.

The word is translated in the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>: in the Vulgate, <span class="accented">lampas</span>; hence some have supposed that, besides the seven lamps, there was another large light in the centre; but the Greek and Latin rendering is mistaken, the word meaning "a fountain" (<a href="/joshua/15-19.htm">Joshua 15:19</a>), or "a ball" (<a href="/1_kings/7-41.htm">1 Kings 7:41</a>), or "a round bowl" (<a href="/ecclesiastes/12-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And seven pipes to the seven lamps, which are upon the top thereof.</span> The Hebrew is, literally rendered, <span class="accented">seven and seven pipes to the lamps which are upon its top.</span> The LXX. translates, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>, "And seven vessels for the lamps which are upon it;" so the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Septem infusoria lucernis, quae erant super caput ejus</span>. These versions imply that there was one supply pipe to each of the lamps, which seems most natural. In this case, the first "seven" in the text must be an interpolation. Commentators who regard the present reading as correct have taken various ways in explaining it. Some multiply the number into itself, and make the pipes forty-nine; but this is unwarranted by Hebrew usage (Henderson). Others add the numbers together, making fourteen; but here again the copulative <span class="accented">vau</span>, which implies diversity, is an objection. The Revised Version has, "There are seven pipes to each of the lamps, taking the words distributively; but the number of tubes seems here to be unnecessarily large. Dr. Wright considers that there were two pipes to each lamp, one set connecting each to the central bowl, and one connecting the several lamps together. One, however, does not see of what particular use the second set is. Dr. Wright, p. 84, gives a drawing of the candelabrum with  its appurtenances, according to his notion of the vision. The Authorized Version seems to give the correct idea of the passage, whether we arrive at it by rejecting the first "seven," or by considering that it is repeated for emphasis' sake, as Cornelius Lapide and Pressel think: "Seven are the lamps upon it - seven, I say, and seven the pipes." Take it as we may, the point is that the oil is well and copiously supplied to the several lights. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/habakkuk/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"He stands, and sets the earth reeling: He looks, and makes nations tremble; primeval mountains burst in pieces, the early hills sink down: His are ways of the olden time. <a href="/habakkuk/3-7.htm">Habakkuk 3:7</a>. I saw the tents of Cushan under affliction: the curtains of the land of Midian tremble." God coming from afar has now drawn near and taken His stand, to smite the nations as a warlike hero (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-8.htm">Habakkuk 3:8</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-9.htm">Habakkuk 3:9</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-11.htm">Habakkuk 3:11</a>, <a href="/habakkuk/3-12.htm">Habakkuk 3:12</a>). This is affirmed in &#1506;&#1502;&#1491;, He has stationed Himself, not "He steps forth or appears." This standing of Jehovah throws the earth and the nations into trembling. &#1497;&#1502;&#1491;&#1491; cannot mean to measure here, for there is no thought of any measuring of the earth, and it cannot be shown that ma&#770;dad is used in the sense of measuring with the eye (Ros. and Hitzig). Moreover, the choice of the poel, instead of the piel, would still remain unexplained, and the parallelism of the clauses would be disregarded. We must therefore follow the Chaldee, Ges., Delitzsch, and others, who take &#1502;&#1491;&#1491; as the poel of &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;  equals  &#1496;&#1493;&#1468;&#1496;, to set in a reeling motion. It is only with this interpretation that the two parallel clauses correspond, in which &#1497;&#1514;&#1468;&#1512;, the hiphil of &#1504;&#1514;&#1512;, to cause to shake or tremble, answers to &#1497;&#1502;&#1491;&#1491;. This explanation is also required by what follows. For just as <a href="/habakkuk/3-7.htm">Habakkuk 3:7</a> unquestionably gives a further expansion of &#1497;&#1514;&#1468;&#1512; &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501;, so does &#1500;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501; ... &#1497;&#1514;&#1508;&#1468;&#1510;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468; contain the explanation of &#1497;&#1502;&#1491;&#1491; &#1488;&#1512;&#1509;. The everlasting hills crumble (&#1497;&#1514;&#1508;&#1468;&#1510;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468; from &#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509;), i.e., burst and resolve themselves into dust, and the hills sink down, pass away, and vanish (compare the similar description in <a href="/nahum/1-5.htm">Nahum 1:5</a> and <a href="/micah/1-4.htm">Micah 1:4</a>). &#1492;&#1512;&#1512;&#1497;&#1470;&#1506;&#1491; ( equals  &#1492;&#1512;&#1512;&#1497; &#1511;&#1491;&#1501;, <a href="/deuteronomy/33-15.htm">Deuteronomy 33:15</a>) in parallelism with &#1504;&#1468;&#1489;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514; &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501; are the primeval mountains, as being the oldest and firmest constituents of the globe, which have existed from the beginning (&#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497; &#1506;&#1491;, <a href="/job/20-4.htm">Job 20:4</a>), and were formed at the creation of the earth (<a href="/psalms/90-2.htm">Psalm 90:2</a>; <a href="/job/15-7.htm">Job 15:7</a>; <a href="/proverbs/8-25.htm">Proverbs 8:25</a>). &#1492;&#1500;&#1497;&#1499;&#1493;&#1514; &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501; &#1500;&#1493; is not to be taken relatively, and connected with what precedes, "which are the old paths," according to which the hills of God are called everlasting ways (Hitzig); because this does not yield a sense in harmony with the context. It is a substantive clause, and to be taken by itself: everlasting courses or goings are to Him, i.e., He now goes along, as He went along in the olden time. &#1492;&#1500;&#1497;&#1499;&#1492;, the going, advancing, or ways of God, analogous to the &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; &#1506;&#1508;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501;, the course of the primitive world (<a href="/job/22-15.htm">Job 22:15</a>). The prophet had <a href="/psalms/68-25.htm">Psalm 68:25</a> floating before his mind, in which ha&#774;l&#305;&#772;kho&#772;th 'e&#774;lo&#772;h&#305;&#772;m denote the goings of God with His people, or the ways which God had taken from time immemorial in His guidance of them. As He once came down upon Sinai in the cloudy darkness, the thunder, lightning, and fire, to raise Israel up to be His covenant nation, so that the mountains shook (cf. <a href="/judges/5-5.htm">Judges 5:5</a>); so do the mountains and hills tremble and melt away at His coming now. And as He once went before His people, and the tidings of His wondrous acts at the Red Sea threw the neighbouring nations into fear and despair (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/15-14.htm">Exodus 15:14-16</a>); so now, when the course of God moves from Teman to the Red Sea, the nations on both sides of it are filled with terror. Of these, two are individualized in <a href="//biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-7.htm">Habakkuk 3:7</a>, viz., Cushan and Midian. By Cushan we are not to understand the Mesopotamian king named Cushan Rishathaim, who subjugated Israel for eight years after the death of Joshua (<a href="/judges/3-8.htm">Judges 3:8</a>.); for this neither agrees with &#1488;&#1492;&#1500;&#1497;, nor with the introduction of Midian in the parallel clause. The word is a lengthened form for Such, and the name of the African Ethiopians. The Midianites are mentioned along with them, as being inhabitants of the Arabian coast of the Red Sea, which was opposite to them (see at <a href="/exodus/2-15.htm">Exodus 2:15</a>). &#1488;&#1492;&#1500;&#1497; &#1499;, the tents with their inhabitants, the latter being principally intended. The same remark applies to &#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514;, lit., the tent-curtains of the land of Midian, i.e., of the tents pitched in the land of Midian. </body></html>
