Whatever the providences of God about us are, as to public or private affairs, we should see them all as coming from between the mountains of brass, the immoveable counsels and decrees of God; and therefore reckon it as much our folly to quarrel with them, as it is our duty to submit to them. His providences move swiftly and strongly as chariots, but all are directed and governed by his infinite wisdom and sovereign will. The red horses signify war and bloodshed. The black, signify the dismal consequences of war, famines, pestilences, and desolations. The white, signify the return of comfort, peace, and prosperity. The mixed colour, signify events of different complexions, a day of prosperity and a day of adversity. The angels go forth as messengers of God's counsels, and ministers of his justice and mercy. And the secret motions and impulses upon the spirits of men, by which the designs of Providence are carried on, are these four spirits of the heavens, which go forth from God, and fulfil what the God of the spirits of all flesh appoints. All the events which take place in the world spring from the unchangeable counsels of the Lord, which are formed in unerring wisdom, perfect justice, truth, and goodness; and from history it is found that events happened about the period when this vision was sent to the prophet, which seem referred to therein.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/zechariah/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The symbol is different from that in the first vision. There <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/1-8.htm">Zechariah 1:8</a>, they were horses only, with their riders, to go to and fro to enquire; here they are war-chariots with their horses, to execute God's judgments, each in their turn. In the first vision also, there is not the characteristic fourfold division, which reminds of the four world-empires of Daniel Dan. 2; after which, in both prophets, is the mention of the kingdom of Christ. Even if the grisled horses be the same as the speckled of the first vision, the black horses are wanting there, as well as the succession, in which they go forth. The only resemblance is, that there are horses of divers colors, two of which, red and white, are the same. The symbol of the fourth empire, grizzled, strong, remarkably corresponds with the strength and mingled character of the fourth empire in Daniel. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/zechariah/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. red&#8212;implying carnage.<p>black&#8212;representing sorrow; also famine (Re 6:5, 6; compare Zec 1:8).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/zechariah/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> There is no distinction made between chariot and chariot, nor any mention made of the drivers of these chariots, though these are included in the chariots. Now by the different colours of the horses doth the prophet distinguish the chariots, and possibly that is all intended by the various colours, though generally interpreters do guess by the colour of the horses what should be the quality and temper of the times pointed at; of which a little: red horses may signify bloody times, a fiery execution of wrath, <span class="bld"><a href="/revelation/6-4.htm" title="And there went out another horse that was red: and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another: and there was given to him a great sword.">Revelation 6:4</a></span>; black, a time of mortality, and wasting diseases, <span class="bld"><a href="/revelation/6-5.htm" title="And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third beast say, Come and see.

If these are to be understood of the apostles of Christ, and ministers of the Gospel, they may be compared to "horses", for bearing the name of Christ, and drawing the chariot of the Gospel; for their strength to labour in the word and doctrine; for their courage in the cause of Christ; and for their swiftness in doing his work; and to "red" ones, for their flaming zeal for the honour of the Redeemer, and their bloody sufferings for his sake: and if of angels, they may be compared to "horses", because strong and swift to do the will of God; and to "red" ones, because they are the executioners of his wrath and vengeance on wicked men: but if by "the chariots" are meant the monarchies, then by these "red horses" must be designed the Babylonians and Chaldeans, so called because their soldiers were clothed in red, and their chariots were like flaming torches; and they were sanguinary, cruel, and bloody in their tempers, and in their actions to the Jews; and were signified by Nebuchadnezzar's head of gold in his image; see <a href="//biblehub.com/nahum/2-3.htm">Nahum 2:3</a>, <p>and in the second chariot black horses; which, applied to the apostles and ministers of the Gospel, may denote their mean and abject appearance outwardly, and their knowledge in the mysteries of grace, which are dark and obscure to others; and, if understood of angels, is applicable to them, when messengers of ill tidings, or executioners of judgment: but if the monarchies are meant, which seems best, the Medes and Persians are intended; and their "black" colour is expressive of the sorrowful estate of the Jews under them, especially in the time of Haman, as Jarchi and Kimchi observe: black horses were reckoned strong, well made, and fit for labour; and the Ethiopians and Moors chose to have their horses they used in war all of this colour, to strike the greater horror and terror into their enemies; and to see black horses in a dream was accounted a bad omen (s). The Medes and Persians were a strong and warlike people, and were very terrible to their enemies, under Cyrus; and very troublesome and distressing to the Jews, under Cambyses and Ahasuerus. <p>(s) Vid.

They have, however, been interpreted, as for example by Pusey: “Red, as the colour of blood, represented Babylon as sanguinary (<a href="/revelation/6-4.htm" title="And there went out another horse that was red: and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another: and there was given to him a great sword.">Revelation 6:4</a>).” “The colour <span class="ital">black</span> doubtless symbolises the heavy lot, inflicted by the Medo-Persians (<span class="ital">Ib</span>. 5, 6).” “White is a symbol of joy, gladness (<a href="/ecclesiastes/9-8.htm" title="Let your garments be always white; and let your head lack no ointment.">Ecclesiastes 9:8</a>), victory (<a href="/revelation/6-2.htm" title="And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given to him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer.">Revelation 6:2</a>), perhaps also, from its relation to light of acute intelligence.” “The grizzled, the Romans in their mingled character, so prominent in the fourth empire of Daniel (<a href="/context/daniel/2-41.htm" title="And whereas you saw the feet and toes, part of potters' clay, and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, for as much as you saw the iron mixed with miry clay....">Daniel 2:41-43</a>).”<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/zechariah/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Red horses (</span>see note on Zechariah 1:8). The colours of the horses are significant, though the symbols are not undisputed. "Red" symbolizes bloodshed and war (<a href="/isaiah/63-2.htm">Isaiah 63:2</a>; <a href="/revelation/6-4.htm">Revelation 6:4</a>); "black," sorrow and mourning (<a href="/isaiah/1-3.htm">Isaiah 1:3</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/4-28.htm">Jeremiah 4:28</a>; <a href="/revelation/6-5.htm">Revelation 6:5</a>); "white," victory and joy (<a href="/ecclesiastes/9-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:8</a>; <a href="/revelation/6-2.htm">Revelation 6:2</a>; <a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11</a>). What the colour of the horses in the fourth chariot means is very doubtful (see below on ver. 3). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/zephaniah/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The debauchees and rioters generally will also not remain free from punishment. <a href="/zephaniah/1-12.htm">Zephaniah 1:12</a>. "And at that time it will come to pass, that I will search Jerusalem with candles, and visit the men who lie upon their lees, who say in their heart, Jehovah does no good, and no evil. <a href="/zephaniah/1-13.htm">Zephaniah 1:13</a>. Their goods will become plunder, and their houses desolation: they will build houses, and not dwell (therein), and plant vineyards, and not drink their wine." God will search Jerusalem with candles, to bring out the irreligious debauchees out of their hiding-places in their houses, and punish them. The visitation is effected by the enemies who conquer Jerusalem. Jerome observes on this passage: "Nothing will be allowed to escape unpunished. If we read the history of Josephus, we shall find it written there, that princes and priests, and mighty men, were dragged even out of the sewers, and caves, and pits, and tombs, in which they had hidden themselves from fear of death." Now, although what is stated here refers to the conquest of Jerusalem by Titus, there can be no doubt that similar things occurred at the Chaldaean conquest. The expression to search with candles (cf. <a href="/luke/15-8.htm">Luke 15:8</a>) is a figure denoting the most minute search of the dwellings and hiding-places of the despisers of God. These are described as men who sit drawn together upon their lees (&#1511;&#1508;&#1488;, lit., to draw one's self together, to coagulate). The figure is borrowed from old wine, which has been left upon its lees and not drawn off, and which, when poured into other vessels, retains its flavour, and does not alter its odour (<a href="/jeremiah/48-11.htm">Jeremiah 48:11</a>), and denotes perseverance or confirmation in moral and religious indifference, "both external quiet, and carelessness, idleness, and spiritual insensibility in the enjoyment not only of the power and possessions bestowed upon them, but also of the pleasures of sin and the worst kinds of lust" (Marck). Good wine, when it remains for a long time upon its lees, becomes stronger; but bad wine becomes harsher and thicker. Shema&#770;r&#305;&#772;m, lees, do not denote "sins in which the ungodly are almost stupefied" (Jerome), or "splendour which so deprives a man of his senses that there is nothing left either pure or sincere" (Calvin), but "the impurity of sins, which were associated in the case of these men with external good" (Marck). In the carnal repose of their earthly prosperity, they said in their heart, i.e., they thought within themselves, there is no God who rules and judges the world; everything takes place by chance, or according to dead natural laws. They did not deny the existence of God, but in their character and conduct they denied the working of the living God in the world, placing Jehovah on the level of the dead idols, who did neither good nor harm (<a href="/isaiah/41-23.htm">Isaiah 41:23</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/10-5.htm">Jeremiah 10:5</a>), whereby they really denied the being of God.<p>(Note: "For neither the majesty of God, nor His government or glory, consists in any imaginary splendour, but in those attributes which so meet together in Him that they cannot be severed from His essense. It is the property of God to govern the world, to take care of the human race, to distinguish between good and evil, to relieve the wretched, to punish all crimes, to restrain unjust violence. And if any one would deprive God of these, he would leave nothing but an idol." - Calvin.)<p>To these God will show Himself as the ruler and judge of the world, by giving up their goods (che&#772;la&#770;m, opes eorum) to plunder, so that they will experience the truth of the punishments denounced in His word against the despisers of His name (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/26-32.htm">Leviticus 26:32-33</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-30.htm">Deuteronomy 28:30</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-39.htm">Deuteronomy 28:39</a>, and the similar threats in <a href="/amos/5-11.htm">Amos 5:11</a>; <a href="/micah/6-15.htm">Micah 6:15</a>). </body></html>
