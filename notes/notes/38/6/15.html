Those who cannot forward a good work by their persons, must, as they are able, forward it by their purses: if some find hands, let others fill them. Crowns are to be made, and put upon the head of Joshua. The sign was used, to make the promise more noticed, that God will, in the fulness of time, raise up a great High Priest, like Joshua, who is but the figure of one that is to come. Christ is not only the Foundation, but the Founder of this temple, by his Spirit and grace. Glory is a burden, but not too heavy for Him to bear who upholds all things. The cross was His glory, and he bore that; so is the crown an exceeding weight of glory, and he bears that. The counsel of peace should be between the priest and the throne, between the priestly and kingly offices of Jesus Christ. The peace and welfare of the gospel church, and of all believers, shall be wrought, though not by two several persons, yet by two several offices meeting in one; Christ, purchasing all peace by his priesthood, maintaining and defending it by his kingdom. The crowns used in this solemnity must be kept in the temple, as evidence of this promise of the Messiah. Let us not think of separating what God has joined in his counsel of peace. We cannot come to God by Christ as our Priest, if we refuse to have him rule over us as our King. We have no real ground to think our peace is made with God, unless we try to keep his commandments.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/zechariah/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And they who are far off shall come - They who came from Babylon with offerings to God, became types of the Gentiles, of whom the Apostle says, "Now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off have become nigh through the blood of Christ" <a href="/ephesians/2-13.htm">Ephesians 2:13</a>; and, "He came and preached peace to you which were far off and to them that were nigh" <a href="/ephesians/2-17.htm">Ephesians 2:17</a>; and "the promise is to you and to your children, and to all that are far off, as many as the Lord our God shall call" <a href="/acts/2-39.htm">Acts 2:39</a>.<p>And build in - or upon, the temple of the Lord (<a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-4.htm">Nehemiah 4:4</a>, <a href="/nehemiah/4-11.htm">Nehemiah 4:11</a> (<a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-10.htm">Nehemiah 4:10</a>, <a href="/nehemiah/4-17.htm">Nehemiah 4:17</a> in English).) Not "build it" for it was to be built by "the Branch," but "build on," labor on, it. It was a building, which should continually be enlarged; of which Paul says, "I, as a wise master-builder, according to the grace given unto me, laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon; let every man take heed how, he buildeth thereupon" <a href="/1_corinthians/3-10.htm">1 Corinthians 3:10</a>.

"Ye shall know (he had said) that the Lord of hosts hath sent me unto you;" but whether this knowledge should reach to individuals, depends upon their obedience and their willingness to know; "it shall be, , if ye will diligently obey the voice of the Lord your God. For none of the wicked," Daniel says, "shall understand" <a href="/daniel/12-10.htm">Daniel 12:10</a>; and Hosea, "Who is wise, and he shall understand these things? prudent, and he shall know them?

This, too, was included in the "peace" spoken of in Zec 6:13 (Ac 2:39; Eph 2:12-17). Primarily, however, the return of the dispersed Israelites "from afar" (Isa 60:9) to the king of the Jews at Jerusalem is intended, to be followed, secondly, by the conversion of the Gentiles from "far off" (Zec 2:11; 8:2-2, 23; Isa 60:10; 57:19).<p>build in the temple&#8212;Christ "builds the temple" (Zec 6:12, 13; Heb 3:3, 4): His people "build in the temple." Compare Heb 3:2, "Moses in His house."<p>ye shall know, &c.&#8212;when the event corresponds to the prediction (Zec 2:9; 4:9).<p>this shall come to pass, if ye &#8230; obey, &c.&#8212;To the Jews of Zechariah's day a stimulus is given to diligent prosecution of the temple building, the work which it was meanwhile their duty to fulfil, relying on the hope of the Messiah afterwards to glorify it. The completion of the temple shall "come to pass," if ye diligently on your part "obey the Lord." It is not meant that their unbelief could set aside God's gracious purpose as to Messiah's coming. But there is, secondarily, meant, that Messiah's glory as priest-king of Israel shall not be manifested to the Jews till they turn to Him with obedient penitence. They meanwhile are cast away "branches" until they be grafted in again on the Branch and their own olive tree (Zec 3:8; 12:10-12; Mt 23:39; Ro 11:16-24).   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/zechariah/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This verse hath certainly a double reference, one to the Jews, and the building of the material temple, which is the literal and historical sense; the other mystical, and refers to the bringing in of the Gentiles. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">They that are far off; </span> such Jews as do now abide in Babylon and Persia, or other remote parts.

After the lapse of nearly two years, Zechariah is again called to prophesy, the occasion of his doing so being the arrival at Jerusalem of a deputation, sent from Bethel to enquire whether they ought still to observe a national fast, which had been instituted in the time of the captivity, <a href="/context/zechariah/7-1.htm" title="And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Darius, that the word of the LORD came to Zechariah in the fourth day of the ninth month, even in Chisleu;...">Zechariah 7:1-3</a>.

In the first section the people are reminded that their fasting and feasting had alike been observances terminating upon themselves and devoid of religious motive and spiritual aim, and consequently unacceptable to God; in accordance with the teaching of the earlier prophets, in the times of Jerusalem’s prosperity, <a href="/context/zechariah/7-4.htm" title="Then came the word of the LORD of hosts to me, saying,...">Zechariah 7:4-7</a>.

"I have heard the abuse of Moab, and the revilings of the sons of Ammon, who have abused my nation, and boasted against its boundary. <a href="/zephaniah/2-9.htm">Zephaniah 2:9</a>. Therefore, as I live, is the saying of Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Yea, Moab shall become like Sodom, and the sons of Ammon like Gomorrha, an inheritance of nettles and salt-pits, and desert for ever. The remnant of my nation will plunder them, the residue of my nation will inherit them. <a href="/zephaniah/2-10.htm">Zephaniah 2:10</a>. Such to them for their pride, that they have despised and boasted against the nation of Jehovah of hosts." The threat now turns from the Philistines in the west to the two tribes to the east, viz., the Moabites and Ammonites, who were descended from Lot, and therefore blood-relations, and who manifested hostility to Israel on every possible occasion. Even in the time of Moses, the Moabitish king Balak sought to destroy Israel by means of Balaam's curses (<a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/22.htm">Numbers 22</a>), for which the Moabites were threatened with extermination (<a href="/numbers/24-17.htm">Numbers 24:17</a>). In the time of the judges they both attempted to oppress Israel (<a href="/judges/3-12.htm">Judges 3:12</a>. and <a href="/judges/10-7.htm">Judges 10:7</a>.; cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-1.htm">1 Samuel 11:1-5</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/10.htm">2 Samuel 10-12</a>), for which they were severely punished by Saul and David (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-47.htm">1 Samuel 14:47</a>, and <a href="/2_samuel/8-2.htm">2 Samuel 8:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-30.htm">2 Samuel 12:30-31</a>). The reproach of Moab and the revilings of the Ammonites, which Jehovah had heard, cannot be taken, as Jerome, Rashi, and others suppose, as referring to the hostilities of those tribes towards the Judaeans during the Chaldaean catastrophe; nor restricted, as v. Clln imagines, to the reproaches heaped upon the ten tribes when they were carried away by the Assyrians, since nothing is know of any such reproaches. The charge refers to the hostile attitude assumed by both tribes at all times towards the nation of God, which they manifested both in word and deed, as often as the latter was brought into trouble and distress. Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-26.htm">Jeremiah 48:26-27</a>; and for gidde&#772;ph, to revile or blaspheme by actions, <a href="/numbers/15-30.htm">Numbers 15:30</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/20-27.htm">Ezekiel 20:27</a>; also for the fact itself, the remarks on <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/1-13.htm">Amos 1:13-2:3</a>. &#1497;&#1490;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; &#1506;&#1500; &#1490;&#1489;, they did great things against their (the Israelites') border (the suffix in gebhu&#772;la&#770;m, their border, refers to &#8219;amm&#305;&#772;, my people). This great doing consisted in their proudly violating the boundary of Israel, and endeavouring to seize upon Israelitish territory (cf. <a href="/amos/1-13.htm">Amos 1:13</a>). Pride and haughtiness, or high-minded self-exaltation above Israel as the nation of God, is charged against the Moabites and Ammonites by Isaiah and Jeremiah also, as a leading feature in their character (cf. <a href="/isaiah/16-6.htm">Isaiah 16:6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/25-11.htm">Isaiah 25:11</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-29.htm">Jeremiah 48:29-30</a>). Moab and Ammon are to be utterly exterminated in consequence. The threat of punishment is announced in <a href="/zephaniah/2-8.htm">Zephaniah 2:8</a> as irrevocable by a solemn oath. It shall happen to them as to Sodom and Gomorrha. This simile was rendered a very natural one by the situation of the two lands in the neighbourhood of the Dead Sea. It affirms the utter destruction of the two tribes, as the appositional description shows. Their land is to become the possession of nettles, i.e., a place where nettles grow. Mimsha&#770;q, hap leg., from the root ma&#770;shaq, which was not used, but from which mesheq in <a href="/genesis/15-2.htm">Genesis 15:2</a> is derived. Cha&#770;ru&#772;l: the stinging nettle (see at <a href="/job/30-7.htm">Job 30:7</a>), which only flourishes in waste places. Mikhre&#772;h melach: a place of salt-pits, like the southern coast of the Dead Sea, which abounds in rock-salt, and to which there is an allusion in the threat of Moses in <a href="/deuteronomy/29-22.htm">Deuteronomy 29:22</a>. "A desert for ever:" the emphasis lies upon &#8219;ad &#8219;o&#772;la&#770;m (for ever) here. The people, however, i.e., the Moabites and Ammonites themselves, will be taken by the people of Jehovah, and be made their possession. The suffixes attached to &#1497;&#1489;&#1494;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; and &#1497;&#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; can only refer to the people of Moab and Ammon, because a land turned into an eternal desert and salt-steppe would not be adapted for a nacha&#774;la&#770;h (possession) for the people of God. The meaning is not, they will be their heirs through the medium of plunder, but they will make them into their own property, or slaves (cf. <a href="/isaiah/14-2.htm">Isaiah 14:2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/61-5.htm">Isaiah 61:5</a>). &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1497; is &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497; with the suffix of the first person, only one of the two &#1497; being written. In <a href="/zephaniah/2-10.htm">Zephaniah 2:10</a> the threat concludes with a repetition of the statement of the guilt which is followed by such a judgment.<p>The fulfilment or realization of the threat pronounced upon Philistia, Moab, and Ammon, we have not to look for in the particular historical occurrences through which these tribes were conquered and subjugated by the Chaldaeans, and to some extent by the Jews after the captivity, until they eventually vanished from the stage of history, and their lands became desolate, as they still are. These events can only come into consideration as preliminary stages of the fulfilment, which Zephaniah completely passes by, since he only views the judgment in its ultimate fulfilment. We are precluded, moreover, from taking the words as relating to that event by the circumstance, that neither Philistia on the one hand, nor Moabites and Ammonites on the other, were ever taken permanent possession of by the Jews; and still less were they ever taken by Judah, as the nation of God, for His own property. Judah is not to enter into such possession as this till the Lord turns the captivity of Judah (<a href="/zephaniah/2-7.htm">Zephaniah 2:7</a>); that is to say, not immediately after the return from the Babylonish captivity, but when the dispersion of Israel among the Gentiles, which lasts till this day, shall come to an end, and Israel, through its conversion to Christ, be reinstated in the privileges of the people of God. It follows from this, that the fulfilment is still in the future, and that it will be accomplished not literally, but spiritually, in the utter destruction of the nations referred to as heathen nations, and opponents of the kingdom of God, and in the incorporation of those who are converted to the living God at the time of the judgment, into the citizenship of the spiritual Israel. Until the eventual restoration of Israel, Philistia will remain an uninhabited shepherds' pasture, and the land of the Moabites and Ammonites the possession of nettles, a place of salt-pits and a desert; just as the land of Israel will for the very same time be trodden down by the Gentiles. The curse resting upon these lands will not be entirely removed till the completion of the kingdom of God on earth. This view is proved to be correct by the contents of <a href="//biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-11.htm">Zephaniah 2:11</a>, with which the prophet passes to the announcement of the judgment upon the nations of the south and north. </body></html>
