Those who cannot forward a good work by their persons, must, as they are able, forward it by their purses: if some find hands, let others fill them. Crowns are to be made, and put upon the head of Joshua. The sign was used, to make the promise more noticed, that God will, in the fulness of time, raise up a great High Priest, like Joshua, who is but the figure of one that is to come. Christ is not only the Foundation, but the Founder of this temple, by his Spirit and grace. Glory is a burden, but not too heavy for Him to bear who upholds all things. The cross was His glory, and he bore that; so is the crown an exceeding weight of glory, and he bears that. The counsel of peace should be between the priest and the throne, between the priestly and kingly offices of Jesus Christ. The peace and welfare of the gospel church, and of all believers, shall be wrought, though not by two several persons, yet by two several offices meeting in one; Christ, purchasing all peace by his priesthood, maintaining and defending it by his kingdom. The crowns used in this solemnity must be kept in the temple, as evidence of this promise of the Messiah. Let us not think of separating what God has joined in his counsel of peace. We cannot come to God by Christ as our Priest, if we refuse to have him rule over us as our King. We have no real ground to think our peace is made with God, unless we try to keep his commandments.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/zechariah/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And make crowns - Or a "crown" , as in Job, "I would bind it as a crown unto me," and our Lord is seen in the Revelation, "on His Head were many crowns" . The singular is used of "a royal crown" , apparently of a festive crown ; and figuratively; (<a href="//biblehub.com/job/19-9.htm">Job 19:9</a>, (plur. <a href="/job/31-36.htm">Job 31:36</a>) <a href="/proverbs/4-9.htm">Proverbs 4:9</a>; <a href="/proverbs/12-4.htm">Proverbs 12:4</a>; <a href="/proverbs/14-24.htm">Proverbs 14:24</a>; <a href="/proverbs/16-31.htm">Proverbs 16:31</a>. <a href="/proverbs/17-6.htm">Proverbs 17:6</a>); even of Almighty God Himself as a crown ; but no where of the mitre of the high priest.<p>The characteristic of the act is, that "the crown" or crowns (it is not in the context said, which) were placed on the head of the one high priest, Joshua; "and thou shall place" (it or them, it is not said which) "upon the head of Joshua son of Josedech the high priest, and shalt say unto him." If crowns were made of each material, there were two crowns. But this is not said, and the silver might have formed a circlet in the crown of gold, as, in modern times, the iron crown of Lombardy, was called iron, because it had "a plate of iron in its summit, being else of gold and most precious" . In any case the symbolical act was completed by the placing of a royal crown upon the head of the high priest. This, in itself, represented that He, whom he and all other priests represented, would be also our King. It is all one then, whether the word designate one single crown, so entitled for its greatness, or one united royal crown, that is, one crown uniting many crowns, symbolizing the many kingdoms of the earth, over which our High Priest and King should rule.<p>Either symbol, of separate crowns  "the golden at Rome." Du Cang. Otto of Frisingen said that Frederic received 5 crowns; the first at Aix for the kingdom of the Franks; a second at Ratisban for that of Germany; a third at Pavia for the kingdom of Lombardy; the fourth at Rome for the Roman empire from Adrian iv; the fifth of Monza for the kingdom of Italy." In our own memory, Napoleon I. having been crowned in France, was crowned with the iron crown at Monza), or an united crown , has been used in the same meaning, to symbolize as many empires, as there were crowns.<p>On Zerubbabel no crown was placed. It would have been confusing; a seeming restoration of the kingdom, when it was not to be restored; an encouragement of the temporal hopes, which were the bane of Israel. God had foretold, that none of the race of Jehoiakim should prosper, "sitting on the throne of David, or ruling any more in Israel." Nehemiah rejects the imputation of Sanballat, "Thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at Jerusalem," There is "a king in Judah." He answers, "There are no such things done as thou sayest; and thou feignest them out of thine own heart" <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-6.htm">Nehemiah 6:6-8</a>. But Isaiah had foretold much of the king who should reign: Zechariah, by placing the royal crown on the head of Joshua, foreshowed that the kingdom was not to be of this world. The royal crown had been taken away in the time of Zedekiah, "Thus saith the Lord God, Remove the diadem and take away the crown; this shall not be this; exalt the low and abase the high; an overthrow, overthrow, overthrow will I make it; this too is not; until he come whose the right is, and I will give it" (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-31.htm">Ezekiel 21:31-32</a> (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-26.htm">Ezekiel 21:26-27</a> in English)).<p>But the Messiah, it was foretold, was to be both priest and king; "a priest after the order of Melchizedec" <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/110-4.htm">Psalm 110:4</a>, and a king, set by the Lord "upon His holy hill of Zion" <a href="/psalms/2-6.htm">Psalm 2:6</a>. The act of placing the crown on the head of Joshua the high priest, pictured not only the union of the offices of priest and king in the person of Christ, but that He should be King, being first our High Priest. Joshua was already high priest; being such, the kingly crown was added to him. It says in act, what Paul says, that "Christ Jesus, being found in fashion as a man, humbled Himself and became obedient unto death, even the death of the Cross. Wherefore God also hath highly exalted Him" <a href="//biblehub.com/philippians/2-8.htm">Philippians 2:8-9</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/zechariah/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11.

The Targum renders it, "thou shalt make a great crown"; as if only one crown was to be made of gold and silver mixed together; and so the Arabic version renders it; but more are certainly meant, for it follows: <p>and set them upon the head of Joshua the son of Josedech the high priest; on whose head a fair mitre was set; see <a href="/zechariah/3-5.htm">Zechariah 3:5</a> and with the mitre was wore by the high priest the holy crown, made of pure gold; and which was no other than the plate or "flower" of gold, on which was engraved "Holiness to the Lord", <a href="/exodus/28-36.htm">Exodus 28:36</a> and this, according to the Jewish writers (b), was a plate of gold two fingers broad, and reached from ear to ear; though Josephus (c) seems to give a different account of it; he says, <p>"the golden crown surrounds (either the mitre, or perhaps rather the forehead or temples); and on it were three rows of cups or flowers, like those of the herb we call "saccharus"; and the Grecian botanists "hyosciamus";'' <p>or henbane; and after describing the herb, and the figure of the buds, cups, or flowers of it, he adds, <p>"like to these is made a crown reaching from the hinder part of the head unto both temples; for the flowers do not encompass the forehead; but there is a golden plate, which has the name of God engraved in sacred letters;'' <p>which seems to disagree with the accounts of other Jewish writers; unless, as Braunius (d) observes, they may be thus reconciled, that the crown was nothing else but the plate that was two fingers broad, and was in length from ear to ear; so that about the temples it was ornamented with three rows of henbane flowers on each side: and these three rows may give occasion for the use of the word in the plural number; and some have called it a triple crown (e); and Popish writers fail not to improve it in favour of the crown their pontiff wears; and Lyra (f) speaks of little crowns or coronets, even in the mitres of the common priests; which (he says) were circles in the lower part of them so called; wherefore the rows of flowers in the high priest's crown, from whence it might be called  a flower, might with more propriety bear that name. Philo the Jew (g), speaking of the golden plate, says it was like a crown engraven with four letters of the name (Jehovah); and further observes, that <p>"the mitre under it kept the plate from touching the head, on which the "cidaris" or diadem was put; for it was like the cidaris which the eastern kings used for a diadem:'' <p>and indeed this crown, and the three rows of flowers in it, were a hieroglyphic or emblem of the threefold office of Christ, whom the high priest represented, kingly, priestly, and prophetic; and so may be fitly signified here by crowns in the plural number; and it is usual with the Jewish writers to speak of three crowns, the crown of the law, the crown of the kingdom, and the crown of the priesthood (h); and very probably from the high priest among the Jews wearing crowns it was that the priests among the Heathens had the same ornaments on their heads; and to be crowned was with them the same as to exercise the office of priesthood (i), and who was an eminent type of the Messiah, and in this of having crowns put upon his head, as the following words show. <p>(b) Maimon.

However  unwilling the Jews were to let the Samaritans take part in the good work, they were quite ready to receive contributions from their brethren in the dispersion, and likewise from heathen kings and princes (see <a href="/ezra/6-8.htm">Ezra 6:8</a>, etc.; Ezra 7:15, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Make crowns.</span> The prophet was to get the crowns made (comp. <a href="/exodus/25.htm">Exodus 25</a>, <span class="accented">passim</span>).

It is certain that only one crown was to be made, and that that was to be placed on Joshua's head. There is no mention of Zerubbabel in the passage; so the plural cannot be taken to intimate that there was a crown for the high priest and a crown for the princely ruler, as Ewald and Bunsen assert. These critics, followed by Hitzig and Wellhausen, supply the passage thus: "on the head of Zerubbabel and on the head of Joshua." Zerubbabel had no kingly position. Rather, all mention of Zerubbabel is expressly excluded, in order to denote that in the Person of him whom Joshua symbolized, the offices of priest and king were united (<a href="/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110</a>). We may note that in <a href="/revelation/19-12.htm">Revelation 19:12</a> Christ is said to have on his head many crowns, by which is meant a diadem composed of many circlets. The high priest's mitre is never called a crown. That which was placed on Joshua's head was a royal crown, a token of royal dignity, not his own, but his whom he represented - Christ the eternal Priest, the universal King. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/zephaniah/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Destruction of the Philistines. - <a href="/zephaniah/2-4.htm">Zephaniah 2:4</a>. "For Gaza will be forgotten, and Ashkelon become a desert; Ashdod, they drive it out in broad day, and Ekron will be ploughed out. <a href="/zephaniah/2-5.htm">Zephaniah 2:5</a>. Woe upon the inhabitants of the tract by the sea, the nation of the Cretans! The word of Jehovah upon you, O Canaan, land of the Philistines! I destroy thee, so that not an inhabitant remains. <a href="/zephaniah/2-6.htm">Zephaniah 2:6</a>. And the tract by the sea becomes pastures for shepherds' caves, and for folds of sheep. <a href="/zephaniah/2-7.htm">Zephaniah 2:7</a>. And a tract will be for the remnant of the house of Judah; upon them will they feed: in the houses of Ashkelon they encamp in the evening; for Jehovah their God will visit them, and turn their captivity." The fourth verse, which is closely connected by k&#305;&#772; (for) with the exhortation to repentance, serves as an introduction to the threat of judgment commencing with ho&#772;i in <a href="/zephaniah/2-5.htm">Zephaniah 2:5</a>. As the mentioning of the names of the four Philistian capitals (see at <a href="/joshua/13-3.htm">Joshua 13:3</a>) is simply an individualizing periphrasis for the Philistian territory and people, so the land and people of Philistia are mentioned primarily for the purpose of individualizing, as being the representatives of the heathen world by which Judah was surrounded; and it is not till afterwards, in the further development of the threat, that the enumeration of certain near and remote heathen nations is appended, to express more clearly the idea of the heathen world as a whole. Of the names of the Philistian cities Zephaniah makes use of two, &#8219;Azza&#770;h and &#8219;Eqro&#772;n, as a play upon words, to express by means of paronomasia the fate awaiting them. &#8219;azza&#770;h, Gaza, will be &#8219;azu&#770;bha&#770;h, forsaken, desolate. &#8219;Eqro&#772;n, Ekron, will be te&#772;&#8219;a&#770;qe&#772;r, rooted up, torn out of its soil, destroyed. To the other two he announces their fate in literal terms, the shema&#770;ma&#770;h threatened against Ashkelon corresponding to the &#8219;a&#774;zu&#772;bha&#770;h, and the ga&#770;re&#772;sh predicated of Ashdod preparing the way for Ekron's te&#772;&#8219;a&#770;qe&#772;r. &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1468;&#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; at noon, i.e., in broad day, might signify, when used as an antithesis to night, "with open violence" (Jerome, Kimchi); but inasmuch as the expulsion of inhabitants is not effected by thieves in the night, the time of noon is more probably to be understood, as v. Clln and Rosenmller suppose, as denoting the time of day at which men generally rest in hot countries (<a href="/2_samuel/4-5.htm">2 Samuel 4:5</a>), in the sense of unexpected, unsuspected expulsion; and this is favoured by <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-8.htm">Jeremiah 15:8</a>, where the devastation at noon is described as a sudden invasion. The omission of Gath may be explained in the same manner as in <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/1-6.htm">Amos 1:6-8</a>, from the fact that the parallelism of the clauses only allowed the names of four cities to be given; and this number was amply sufficient to individualize the whole, just as Zephaniah, when enumerating the heathen nations, restricts the number to four, according to the four quarters of the globe: viz., the Philistines in the west (<a href="//biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-5.htm">Zephaniah 2:5-7</a>); the Moabites and Ammonites comprised in one in the east (<a href="//biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-8.htm">Zephaniah 2:8-10</a>); the Cushites in the south (<a href="//biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-11.htm">Zephaniah 2:11</a>, <a href="/zephaniah/2-12.htm">Zephaniah 2:12</a>); and Asshur, with Nineveh, in the north (north-east), (<a href="//biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-13.htm">Zephaniah 2:13-15</a>). The woe with which the threat is commenced in <a href="/zephaniah/2-5.htm">Zephaniah 2:5</a> applies to the whole land and people of the Philistines. Chebhel, the measure, then the tract of land measured out or apportioned (see at <a href="/deuteronomy/3-4.htm">Deuteronomy 3:4</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-9.htm">Deuteronomy 32:9</a>, etc.). The tract of the sea is the tract of land by the Mediterranean Sea which was occupied by the Philistines (chebhel hayya&#770;m  equals  'erets Pelisht&#305;&#772;m). Zephaniah calls the inhabitants go&#772;i Kere&#772;th&#305;&#772;m, nation of the Cretans, from the name of one branch of the Philistian people which was settled in the south-west of Philistia, for the purpose of representing them as a people devoted to ka&#770;rath, or extermination. The origin of this name, which is selected both here and in <a href="/ezekiel/25-16.htm">Ezekiel 25:16</a> with a play upon the appellative signification, is involved in obscurity; for, as we have already observed at <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-14.htm">1 Samuel 30:14</a>, there is no valid authority for the derivation which is now current, viz., from the island of Crete (see Stark, Gaza, pp. 66 and 99ff.). &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; &#1497;&#1497; &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501; forms an independent sentence: The word of the Lord cometh over you. The nature of that word is described in the next sentence: I will destroy thee. The name Kena&#8219;an is used in the more limited sense of Philistia, and is chosen to indicate that Philistia is to share the lot of Canaan, and lose its inhabitants by extermination. </body></html>
