Whatever the providences of God about us are, as to public or private affairs, we should see them all as coming from between the mountains of brass, the immoveable counsels and decrees of God; and therefore reckon it as much our folly to quarrel with them, as it is our duty to submit to them. His providences move swiftly and strongly as chariots, but all are directed and governed by his infinite wisdom and sovereign will. The red horses signify war and bloodshed. The black, signify the dismal consequences of war, famines, pestilences, and desolations. The white, signify the return of comfort, peace, and prosperity. The mixed colour, signify events of different complexions, a day of prosperity and a day of adversity. The angels go forth as messengers of God's counsels, and ministers of his justice and mercy. And the secret motions and impulses upon the spirits of men, by which the designs of Providence are carried on, are these four spirits of the heavens, which go forth from God, and fulfil what the God of the spirits of all flesh appoints. All the events which take place in the world spring from the unchangeable counsels of the Lord, which are formed in unerring wisdom, perfect justice, truth, and goodness; and from history it is found that events happened about the period when this vision was sent to the prophet, which seem referred to therein.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/zechariah/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The symbol is different from that in the first vision. There <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/1-8.htm">Zechariah 1:8</a>, they were horses only, with their riders, to go to and fro to enquire; here they are war-chariots with their horses, to execute God's judgments, each in their turn. In the first vision also, there is not the characteristic fourfold division, which reminds of the four world-empires of Daniel Dan. 2; after which, in both prophets, is the mention of the kingdom of Christ. Even if the grisled horses be the same as the speckled of the first vision, the black horses are wanting there, as well as the succession, in which they go forth. The only resemblance is, that there are horses of divers colors, two of which, red and white, are the same. The symbol of the fourth empire, grizzled, strong, remarkably corresponds with the strength and mingled character of the fourth empire in Daniel. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/zechariah/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4.

To terrify the self-secure sinners out of their careless rest, Zephaniah now carries out still further the thought only hinted at in <a href="/zephaniah/1-7.htm">Zephaniah 1:7</a> of the near approach and terrible character of the judgment. <a href="/zephaniah/1-14.htm">Zephaniah 1:14</a>. "The great day of Jehovah is near, near and hasting greatly. Hark! the day of Jehovah, bitterly crieth the hero there. <a href="/zephaniah/1-15.htm">Zephaniah 1:15</a>. A day of fury is this day, a day of anguish and pressure, a day of devastation and desert, a day of darkness and gloom, a day of cloud and cloudy night. <a href="/zephaniah/1-16.htm">Zephaniah 1:16</a>. A day of the trumpet and battering, over the fortified cities and high battlements." The day of Jehovah is called "the great day" with reference to its effects, as in <a href="/joel/2-11.htm">Joel 2:11</a>. The emphasis lies primarily, however, upon the qa&#770;ro&#772;bh (is near), which is therefore repeated and strengthened by &#1502;&#1492;&#1512; &#1502;&#1488;&#1491;. &#1502;&#1492;&#1512; is not a piel participle with the Mem dropped, but an adjective form, which has sprung out of the adverbial use of the inf. abs. (cf. Ewald, 240, e). In the second hemistich the terrible character of this day is described. &#1511;&#1493;&#1500; before yo&#772;m Yeho&#772;va&#770;h (the day of Jehovah), at the head of an interjectional clause, has almost grown into an interjection (see at <a href="/isaiah/13-4.htm">Isaiah 13:4</a>). The hero cries bitterly, because he cannot save himself, and must succumb to the power of the foe. Sha&#770;m, adv. loci, has not a temporal signification even here, but may be explained from the fact that in connection with the day the prophet is thinking of the field of battle, on which the hero perishes while fighting. In order to depict more fully the terrible character of this day, Zephaniah crowds together in <a href="/zephaniah/1-15.htm">Zephaniah 1:15</a> and <a href="/zephaniah/1-16.htm">Zephaniah 1:16</a> all the words supplied by the language to describe the terrors of the judgment. He first of all designates it as yo&#772;m &#8219;ebhra&#770;h, the day of the overflowing wrath of God (cf. <a href="/zephaniah/1-18.htm">Zephaniah 1:18</a>); then, according to the effect which the pouring out of the wrath of God produces upon men, as a day of distress and pressure (cf. <a href="/job/15-24.htm">Job 15:24</a>), of devastation (&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1492; and &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1488;&#1492; combined, as in <a href="/job/38-27.htm">Job 38:27</a>; <a href="/job/30-3.htm">Job 30:3</a>), and of the darkest cloudy night, after <a href="/joel/2-2.htm">Joel 2:2</a>; and lastly, in <a href="//biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-16.htm">Zephaniah 1:16</a>, indicating still more closely the nature of the judgment, as a day of the trumpet and the trumpet-blast, i.e., on which the clangour of the war-trumpets will be heard over all the fortifications and castles, and the enemy will attack, take, and destroy the fortified places amidst the blast of trumpets (cf. <a href="/amos/2-2.htm">Amos 2:2</a>). Pinno&#772;th are the corners and battlements of the walls of the fortifications (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-15.htm">2 Chronicles 26:15</a>). </body></html>
