Whatever the providences of God about us are, as to public or private affairs, we should see them all as coming from between the mountains of brass, the immoveable counsels and decrees of God; and therefore reckon it as much our folly to quarrel with them, as it is our duty to submit to them. His providences move swiftly and strongly as chariots, but all are directed and governed by his infinite wisdom and sovereign will. The red horses signify war and bloodshed. The black, signify the dismal consequences of war, famines, pestilences, and desolations. The white, signify the return of comfort, peace, and prosperity. The mixed colour, signify events of different complexions, a day of prosperity and a day of adversity. The angels go forth as messengers of God's counsels, and ministers of his justice and mercy. And the secret motions and impulses upon the spirits of men, by which the designs of Providence are carried on, are these four spirits of the heavens, which go forth from God, and fulfil what the God of the spirits of all flesh appoints. All the events which take place in the world spring from the unchangeable counsels of the Lord, which are formed in unerring wisdom, perfect justice, truth, and goodness; and from history it is found that events happened about the period when this vision was sent to the prophet, which seem referred to therein.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/zechariah/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the strong went forth and sought to go, that they might walk to and fro through the earth - The mention of their strength corresponds to the extent of the power and commission, for which they asked, to go to and fro, up and down, at their will, unhindered, through the whole earth. The Babylonian empire held Egypt only out of Asia; the Persian was conquered in its efforts against Europe, in Greece; Alexander's was like a meteor, gleaming but breaking into the four: the Roman combined East and West and within large limits tranquilly.<p>And he said go, walk to and fro in the earth - He commanded, and they, which were before withheld, went, "and they walked to and fro on the earth," ordering all things at their will, under the Providence of God, whereby He gave free access to the Gospel in all their wide empire. The Greek empire being extinguished, the Romans no longer went into any given country, but superintended and governed all human things in (it is the language of the New Testament) "all the world." Cyril: "These same, the dappled and ashen-grey horses were commanded to traverse the earth, and they did traverse it; for they mastered all under heaven, and ruled the whole earth, God consenting and arraying those who swayed the Roman might with this brilliant glory. For, as God, He knew beforehand the greatness of their future piety." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/zechariah/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. bay&#8212;rather, the "fleet" (or "strong"). As the "red" are not otherwise mentioned, the epithet "fleet" (as the Hebrew for "bay" ought to be translated) in Zec 6:3 seems to apply to all four, and here especially to the "red." Their office is to complete hereafter the work already in part executed by the previous three who have stilled Babylon, Medo-Persia, and Gr&aelig;co-Macedonia; namely, to punish finally the last great foe of Israel, the final form assumed by the fourth world kingdom, Rome, which is to continue down to the second advent of Christ. Hence they "walk to and fro through the earth," counterworking Satan's "going to and fro in the earth" (Job 1:7; 2Th 2:8, 9; 1Ti 4:1), in connection with the last awful development of the fourth world kingdom. Their "fleetness" is needed to counteract his restless activity; their red color implies the final great carnage (Eze 39:1-29; Re 19:17, 18, 21).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/zechariah/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The bay went forth, </span> from the place where the prophet saw them at first standing as at the starting-place, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">and sought to go, </span> either asked commission or waited for it, <span class="ital">that they might walk to and fro through the earth</span>: they had a larger commission, say some, the whole earth; or a particular commission to keep their rounds in the land of Judea, and to take care of their affairs for the comfort of that people. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">He said, </span> Christ, who hath all power in heaven and on earth, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Get you hence; </span> stay no longer here, hasten to your charge; as you have desired, so do. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">So they walked to and fro through the earth; </span> they obey immediately, and do his commands. These bay horses are here represented as attempting, or making essay, which at first seems to take little effect, though at last, by a full commission empowered, they do succeed in the attempt. This might give ground to suppose here is some kingdom aimed at, which made some attempts to enlarge itself through all the earth, but failed in its attempt, which no wonder, since the angels which were to assist were not commissioned to walk through the whole earth, and they keeping to their commission gave no further help, for want of which the design failed. How far this may concern Goths and Vandais, or any more late empires and kingdoms, I have neither skill nor will further to inquire. Nor yet to inquire whether these bay horses were not emblems of angels employed by the Lord, in the government of the rest of the kingdoms of the world remote from Judea, but not remote from God’s wise and sovereign providence governing all the earth. The known empires here are supposed to have been managed by particular angels, represented according to the analogy between the colours of the horses and the complexion of the kingdoms. And it may seem likely that the rest of the world was not left without some to have care of them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/zechariah/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the bay went forth, and sought to go,....

"And I make it strait for men, and they will walk like blind men, because they have sinned against Jehovah; and their blood will be poured out like dust, and their flesh like dung. <a href="/zephaniah/1-18.htm">Zephaniah 1:18</a>. Even their silver, even their gold, will not be able to save them on the day of Jehovah's fury, and in the fire of His wrath will the whole earth be devoured; for He will make an end, yea a sudden one, to all the inhabitants of the earth." &#1493;&#1492;&#1510;&#1512;&#1514;&#1497; reminds of the threat of Moses in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-52.htm">Deuteronomy 28:52</a>, to which Zephaniah alluded in <a href="/zephaniah/1-16.htm">Zephaniah 1:16</a>. And in &#1492;&#1500;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468; &#1499;&#1468;&#1506;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; the allusion to <a href="/deuteronomy/28-29.htm">Deuteronomy 28:29</a> is also unmistakeable. To walk like the blind, i.e., to seek a way out of the trouble without finding one. This distress God sends, because they have sinned against Him, by falling away from Him through idolatry and the transgression of His commandments, as already shown in <a href="//biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-4.htm">Zephaniah 1:4-12</a>. But the punishment will be terrible. Their blood will be poured out like dust. The point of comparison is not the quantity, as in <a href="/genesis/13-16.htm">Genesis 13:16</a> and others, but the worthlessness of dust, as in <a href="/2_kings/13-7.htm">2 Kings 13:7</a> and <a href="/isaiah/49-23.htm">Isaiah 49:23</a>. The blood is thought as little of as the dust which is trodden under foot. Lechu&#772;m, which occurs again in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/20-23.htm">Job 20:23</a>, means flesh (as in the Arabic), not food. The verb sha&#770;phakh, to pour out, is also to be taken per zeugma in connection with this clause, though without there being any necessity to associate it with <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-10.htm">2 Samuel 20:10</a>, and regard lechu&#772;m as referring to the bowels. For the fact itself, compare <a href="/1_kings/14-10.htm">1 Kings 14:10</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/9-21.htm">Jeremiah 9:21</a>. In order to cut off all hope on deliverance from the rich and distinguished sinners, the prophet adds in <a href="/zephaniah/1-18.htm">Zephaniah 1:18</a> : Even with silver and gold will they not be able to save their lives. The enemy will give no heed to this (cf. <a href="/isaiah/13-17.htm">Isaiah 13:17</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/4-30.htm">Jeremiah 4:30</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/7-19.htm">Ezekiel 7:19</a>) in the day that the Lord will pour out His fury upon the ungodly, to destroy the whole earth with the fire of His wrathful jealousy (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/4-24.htm">Deuteronomy 4:24</a>). By kol-ha&#770;'a&#770;rets we might understand the whole of the land of Judah, if we looked at what immediately precedes it. But if we bear in mind that the threat commenced with judgment upon the whole earth (<a href="//biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-2.htm">Zephaniah 1:2</a>, <a href="/zephaniah/1-3.htm">Zephaniah 1:3</a>), and that it here returns to its starting-point, to round off the picture, there can be no doubt that the whole earth is intended. The reason assigned for this threat in <a href="/zephaniah/1-18.htm">Zephaniah 1:18</a> is formed after <a href="/isaiah/10-23.htm">Isaiah 10:23</a>; but the expression is strengthened by the use of &#1488;&#1498;&#1470;&#1504;&#1489;&#1492;&#1500;&#1492; instead of &#1493;&#1504;&#1495;&#1512;&#1510;&#1492;, the word round in Isaiah. Ka&#770;la&#770;h: the finishing stroke, as in Isaiah l.c. (see at <a href="/nahum/1-8.htm">Nahum 1:8</a>). &#1488;&#1498;, only, equivalent to "not otherwise than," i.e., assuredly. &#1504;&#1489;&#1492;&#1500;&#1492; is used as a substantive, and is synonymous with beha&#770;la&#770;h, sudden destruction, in <a href="/isaiah/65-23.htm">Isaiah 65:23</a>. The construction with 'e&#772;th accus. as in <a href="/nahum/1-8.htm">Nahum 1:8</a>. </body></html>
