Whatever the providences of God about us are, as to public or private affairs, we should see them all as coming from between the mountains of brass, the immoveable counsels and decrees of God; and therefore reckon it as much our folly to quarrel with them, as it is our duty to submit to them. His providences move swiftly and strongly as chariots, but all are directed and governed by his infinite wisdom and sovereign will. The red horses signify war and bloodshed. The black, signify the dismal consequences of war, famines, pestilences, and desolations. The white, signify the return of comfort, peace, and prosperity. The mixed colour, signify events of different complexions, a day of prosperity and a day of adversity. The angels go forth as messengers of God's counsels, and ministers of his justice and mercy. And the secret motions and impulses upon the spirits of men, by which the designs of Providence are carried on, are these four spirits of the heavens, which go forth from God, and fulfil what the God of the spirits of all flesh appoints. All the events which take place in the world spring from the unchangeable counsels of the Lord, which are formed in unerring wisdom, perfect justice, truth, and goodness; and from history it is found that events happened about the period when this vision was sent to the prophet, which seem referred to therein.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/zechariah/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The black horses which are therein go forth - Literally, "That chariot wherein the black horses are, these go forth." Jerome: "Most suitably is the first chariot, wherein the red homes were, passed over, and what the second, third, fourth did is described. For when the prophet related this, the Babylonian empire had passed, and the power of the Medes possessed all Asia." Red, as the color of blood, represented Babylon as sanguinary; as it is said in the Revelation, "There went out another horse, red, and power was given to him that sat thereon, to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another, and there was given him a sharp sword" <a href="/revelation/6-4.htm">Revelation 6:4</a>. "The black" were to go forth to the north country, the ancient title of Babylon. For Babylon, though taken, was far from being broken. They had probably been betrayed through the weakness of their king's. Their resistance, in the first carefully prepared (Herodotus, iii. 150) revolt against Darius, was more courageous than that against Cyrus: and more desperate .<p>Since probably more Jews remained in it, than returned to their own country, what was to befall it had a special interest for them. They had already been warned in the third vision <a href="/zechariah/2-7.htm">Zechariah 2:7</a> to escape from it. The color black doubtless symbolizes the heavy lot, inflicted by the Medo-Persians; as in the Revelation it is said, "the sun became black as sackcloth of hair" <a href="/revelation/6-12.htm">Revelation 6:12</a>; and to the beast in Daniel's vision which corresponded with it, it was said, "Arise, devour much flesh" <a href="/daniel/7-5.htm">Daniel 7:5</a>; and in the Revelation, "he that sat on the black horse" <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/6-5.htm">Revelation 6:5-6</a> was the angel charged with the infliction of famine. Of the Medes, Isaiah had said, "I will stir up the Medes against them (Babylon), which shall not regard silver; and gold, they shall not delight in it. Their bows also shall dash the young men to pieces; and they shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb; their eye shall not spare children" <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/13-17.htm">Isaiah 13:17-18</a>.<p>The white went forth after them - For the Greek empire occupied the same portion of the earth as the Persian. White is a symbol of joy, gladness <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/9-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:8</a>, victory <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/6-2.htm">Revelation 6:2</a>, perhaps also, from its relation to light, of acute intelligence. It may relate too to the benevolence of Alexander to the Jewish nation. "Alexander used such clemency to the conquered, that it seemed as though he might be called rather the founder than the destroyer of the nations whom he subdued."<p>And the grizzled - The Romans in their mingled character, so prominent in the fourth empire of Daniel, "go forth" <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/2-41.htm">Daniel 2:41-43</a> to the south country, that is, Egypt; as Daniel speaks of "the ships of Chittim" <a href="/daniel/11-30.htm">Daniel 11:30</a> and the intervention of the Romans first in regard to the expulsion of Antiochus Epiphanes from Egypt; in Egypt also, the last enduring kingdom of any successor of Alexander, that of the Ptolemies, expired. "30 years afterward, the Son of God was to bring light to the earth. The prophet so interweaves the prediction, that from the series of the four kingdoms it is brought to the Birth of the Eternal King" . <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/zechariah/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. north country&#8212;Babylon (see on [1178]Jer 1:14). The north is the quarter specified in particular whence Judah and Israel are hereafter to return to their own land (Zec 2:6; Jer 3:18). "The black horses" go to Babylon, primarily to represent the awful desolation with which Darius visited it in the fifth year of his reign (two years after this prophecy) for revolting [Henderson]. The "white" go after the "black" horses to the same country; two sets being sent to it because of its greater cruelty and guilt in respect to Judea. The white represent Darius triumphant subjugation of it [Moore]. Rather, I think, the white are sent to victoriously subdue Medo-Persia, the second world kingdom, lying in the same quarter as Babylon, namely, north.<p>grizzled &#8230; toward the south&#8212;that is, to Egypt, the other great foe of God's people.

Why this is omitted has never been satisfactorily explained. Some regard ver. 7 as giving the destination of this chariot, by making a  slight change in the word rendered "bay" in the Authorized Version, which would cause it to mean "red." The Syriac, indeed, which omits the word in ver. 3, translates it here by "red." If we retain the Masoretic reading, we must let this difficulty remain unsolved, and suppose that the angel explains only part of the vision, leaving the rest for the prophet's meditation. <span class="cmt_word">The black horses which are therein;</span> literally, <span class="accented">that wherein are the black horses, they go forth</span>, etc.; which is equivalent to "the chariot wherein are the black horses goeth forth."

One chariot only is seen to go towards it, drawn by the speckled horses that denote a mixed judgment, perhaps of war and pestilence (see on ver. 3). The north and south symbolize the whole earth and the powers hostile to the true Israel. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/zephaniah/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In the midst of this tribulation the sinners will perish without counsel or help. <a href="/zephaniah/1-17.htm">Zephaniah 1:17</a>. "And I make it strait for men, and they will walk like blind men, because they have sinned against Jehovah; and their blood will be poured out like dust, and their flesh like dung. <a href="/zephaniah/1-18.htm">Zephaniah 1:18</a>. Even their silver, even their gold, will not be able to save them on the day of Jehovah's fury, and in the fire of His wrath will the whole earth be devoured; for He will make an end, yea a sudden one, to all the inhabitants of the earth." &#1493;&#1492;&#1510;&#1512;&#1514;&#1497; reminds of the threat of Moses in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-52.htm">Deuteronomy 28:52</a>, to which Zephaniah alluded in <a href="/zephaniah/1-16.htm">Zephaniah 1:16</a>. And in &#1492;&#1500;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468; &#1499;&#1468;&#1506;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; the allusion to <a href="/deuteronomy/28-29.htm">Deuteronomy 28:29</a> is also unmistakeable. To walk like the blind, i.e., to seek a way out of the trouble without finding one. This distress God sends, because they have sinned against Him, by falling away from Him through idolatry and the transgression of His commandments, as already shown in <a href="//biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-4.htm">Zephaniah 1:4-12</a>. But the punishment will be terrible. Their blood will be poured out like dust. The point of comparison is not the quantity, as in <a href="/genesis/13-16.htm">Genesis 13:16</a> and others, but the worthlessness of dust, as in <a href="/2_kings/13-7.htm">2 Kings 13:7</a> and <a href="/isaiah/49-23.htm">Isaiah 49:23</a>. The blood is thought as little of as the dust which is trodden under foot. Lechu&#772;m, which occurs again in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/20-23.htm">Job 20:23</a>, means flesh (as in the Arabic), not food. The verb sha&#770;phakh, to pour out, is also to be taken per zeugma in connection with this clause, though without there being any necessity to associate it with <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-10.htm">2 Samuel 20:10</a>, and regard lechu&#772;m as referring to the bowels. For the fact itself, compare <a href="/1_kings/14-10.htm">1 Kings 14:10</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/9-21.htm">Jeremiah 9:21</a>. In order to cut off all hope on deliverance from the rich and distinguished sinners, the prophet adds in <a href="/zephaniah/1-18.htm">Zephaniah 1:18</a> : Even with silver and gold will they not be able to save their lives. The enemy will give no heed to this (cf. <a href="/isaiah/13-17.htm">Isaiah 13:17</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/4-30.htm">Jeremiah 4:30</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/7-19.htm">Ezekiel 7:19</a>) in the day that the Lord will pour out His fury upon the ungodly, to destroy the whole earth with the fire of His wrathful jealousy (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/4-24.htm">Deuteronomy 4:24</a>). By kol-ha&#770;'a&#770;rets we might understand the whole of the land of Judah, if we looked at what immediately precedes it. But if we bear in mind that the threat commenced with judgment upon the whole earth (<a href="//biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-2.htm">Zephaniah 1:2</a>, <a href="/zephaniah/1-3.htm">Zephaniah 1:3</a>), and that it here returns to its starting-point, to round off the picture, there can be no doubt that the whole earth is intended. The reason assigned for this threat in <a href="/zephaniah/1-18.htm">Zephaniah 1:18</a> is formed after <a href="/isaiah/10-23.htm">Isaiah 10:23</a>; but the expression is strengthened by the use of &#1488;&#1498;&#1470;&#1504;&#1489;&#1492;&#1500;&#1492; instead of &#1493;&#1504;&#1495;&#1512;&#1510;&#1492;, the word round in Isaiah. Ka&#770;la&#770;h: the finishing stroke, as in Isaiah l.c. (see at <a href="/nahum/1-8.htm">Nahum 1:8</a>). &#1488;&#1498;, only, equivalent to "not otherwise than," i.e., assuredly. &#1504;&#1489;&#1492;&#1500;&#1492; is used as a substantive, and is synonymous with beha&#770;la&#770;h, sudden destruction, in <a href="/isaiah/65-23.htm">Isaiah 65:23</a>. The construction with 'e&#772;th accus. as in <a href="/nahum/1-8.htm">Nahum 1:8</a>. </body></html>
