Neither shall the gospel and means of grace, nor the graces of the Spirit wrought in the hearts of believers by those means, ever fail, by reason either of the heat of persecution, or storms of temptation, or the blasts of any other affliction. Tremendous judgments appear to be foretold, to be sent upon those who should oppose the settlement of the Jews in their own land. How far they are to be understood literally, events alone can determine. The furious rage and malice which stir up men against each other, are faint shadows of the enmity which reigns among those who have perished in their sins.

For Judah is united with Jerusalem as one, in the same context <a href="/zechariah/14-21.htm">Zechariah 14:21</a>; and, if it had shared with the pagan, it must also have shared their lot. It is Judah itself, not "a remnant of Judah," as it is "every one that is left of all the nations" <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/14-16.htm">Zechariah 14:16</a>, which is thus united to Jerusalem: it is that same Judah, as a whole, of which it is said, "it shall fight." Nor is anything spoken of" conversion," which is said of those left from the pagan nations, who had fought against her. Yet for Judah to have joined an exterminating pagan war against Jerusalem, even though constrained, had, like the constrained sacrifices to pagan gods, been apostasy. But there is not even a hint that, as Jonathan apologetically paraphrases , they were "constrained."<p>The war is to be Judah's free act: "Judah also shall fight." Again, those gathered against Jerusalem, and their warfare against it, had been described at the outset, as "all nations" (<a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/14-2.htm">Zechariah 14:2-3</a> : here the subject is not the gathering or fighting, but the overthrow. Nor is there any decisive contrary idiom; for, although when used of people, it always means "fight against," yet, of place, it as often, means "fight in". Probably then the prophet means, that not only should God fight for His people, but that "Judah also" should do its part, as Paul says, "We, then, as workers together with Him" <a href="/2_corinthians/6-1.htm">2 Corinthians 6:1</a>; and, "we are laborers together with God" <a href="/1_corinthians/3-9.htm">1 Corinthians 3:9</a>; and, "I labored more abundantly than they all; yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me" <a href="/1_corinthians/15-10.htm">1 Corinthians 15:10</a>; or, "work out your own salvation with fear and trembling; for it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of His good pleasure" <a href="/philippians/2-12.htm">Philippians 2:12</a>. God so doth all things in the Church, for the conversion of the pagan, and for single souls, as to wait for the cooperation of His creature. : "God made thee without thee; He doth not justify thee without thee."<p>And the wealth of all the pagan round about shall be gathered - Whatever the world had taken in their war against the Church shall be abundantly repaid. "All the pagan" had combined to plunder Jerusalem; "the wealth of all the pagan" <a href="/zechariah/14-2.htm">Zechariah 14:2</a> shall be gathered to requite them. Lap.: "As Isaiah says, The nations, converted to Christ, brought all their wealth to the Church, whence he congratulates the Church, saying, "Thou shalt also suck the milk of the Gentiles, and shalt suck the breasts of kings - For brass I will bring gold, and for iron I will bring silver" <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/60-16.htm">Isaiah 60:16-17</a>; under which he typically understands, (Dionysius), "wisdom, philosophy, eloquence, learning, and all the other arts and sciences, liberal and mechanical, wherewith the pagan shall be adorned, who are converted to the faith. So shall the gifts of nature be perfected by the gifts of grace, and 'they' shall defend the Church who erstwhile attacked it." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/zechariah/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14.

There is no question here of the strength or allies of the opposing force, but only of the threefold cause of their destruction, viz. (1) the plague sent by God, <a href="/zechariah/14-12.htm" title="And this shall be the plague with which the LORD will smite all the people that have fought against Jerusalem; Their flesh shall consume away while they stand on their feet, and their eyes shall consume away in their holes, and their tongue shall consume away in their mouth.">Zechariah 14:12</a>; (2) mutual slaughter, <a href="/zechariah/14-13.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in that day, that a great tumult from the LORD shall be among them; and they shall lay hold every one on the hand of his neighbor, and his hand shall rise up against the hand of his neighbor.">Zechariah 14:13</a>; (3) the onslaught of Judah, rallying to defend the capital, <a href="/zechariah/14-14.htm" title="And Judah also shall fight at Jerusalem; and the wealth of all the heathen round about shall be gathered together, gold, and silver, and apparel, in great abundance.">Zechariah 14:14</a>. “A still further element of ‘confusion’ would be added to the adversaries. When Jonathan gained his wonderful victory over the Philistines’ garrison at Michmash, there was a confusion caused by God in the ranks of the Philistines (<a href="/1_samuel/14-20.htm" title="And Saul and all the people that were with him assembled themselves, and they came to the battle: and, behold, every man's sword was against his fellow, and there was a very great discomfiture.">1 Samuel 14:20</a>), which resulted, as here, in a terrible conflict taking place in their own ranks. Those Hebrews who on that occasion were with the Philistines, as well as Israelites who had fled into the holes or fastnesses of the mountains, plucked up courage when they saw the confusion of their adversaries, and stood up boldly against them. Thus in the picture here given, when the ranks of the enemies are thinned by pestilence and mutual slaughter, the prophet represents the whole of the people of Judah, not merely those who had escaped out of the city, but also those who were outside its walls, as once more fighting at Jerusalem, or in its very streets, against the terror-driven, plague-stricken, God-confounded foe.” (Rev.

"And the angel that talked with me returned and waked me, like a man who is waked out of his sleep." After the prophet has seen four visions one after another, probably with very short intervals, and has heard the marvellous interpretation of them, he is so overpowered by the impression produced by what he has seen and heard, that he falls into a state of spiritual exhaustion resembling sleep, just as Peter and his companions were unable to keep awake at the transfiguration of Christ (<a href="/luke/9-32.htm">Luke 9:32</a>). He has not only fallen back into the state of ordinary human consciousness, but his ordinary spiritual consciousness was so depressed that he resembled a man asleep, and had to be waked out of this sleep-like state by the mediating angel, in order to be qualified for further seeing. It is evident from the expression &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; (and he returned) that the angelus interpres had left the prophet after the termination of the previous visions, and now came back to him again. The fresh vision which presents itself to his spiritual intuition, is described according to its principal features in <a href="/zechariah/4-2.htm">Zechariah 4:2</a> and <a href="/zechariah/4-3.htm">Zechariah 4:3</a>. <a href="/zechariah/4-2.htm">Zechariah 4:2</a>. "And he said to me, What seest thou? And I said, I see, and behold a candlestick all of gold, and its oil-vessel up above it, and its seven lamps upon it, seven pipes each for the lamps upon the top of it. <a href="/zechariah/4-3.htm">Zechariah 4:3</a>. And two olive trees (oil trees) by it, one to the right of the oil-vessel, and one to the left of it." The second &#1493;&#1497;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; (chethib) in <a href="/zechariah/4-2.htm">Zechariah 4:2</a> might, if necessary, be explained in the way proposed by L. de Dieu, Gusset., and Hofmann, viz., by supposing that the mediating angel had no sooner asked the prophet what he saw, than he proceeded, without waiting for his answer, to give a description himself of what was seen. But this is at variance with the analogy of all the rest of the visions, where the visions seen by the prophet are always introduced with &#1512;&#1488;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497; or &#1493;&#1488;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; followed by &#1493;&#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; (cf. <a href="/zechariah/1-8.htm">Zechariah 1:8</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/2-1.htm">Zechariah 2:1</a>, <a href="/zechariah/2-5.htm">Zechariah 2:5</a>; <a href="/zechariah/5-1.htm">Zechariah 5:1</a>; <a href="/zechariah/6-1.htm">Zechariah 6:1</a>), and it remains quite inflexible; so that we must accept the keri &#1493;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;, which is adopted by the early translators, and found in many codd., as being the true reading, and pronounce &#1493;&#1497;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; a copyist's error. On the combination &#1502;&#1504;&#1493;&#1512;&#1514; &#1494;&#1492;&#1489; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468;, in which the last two words are construed as a relative clause in subordination to meno&#772;rath, see Ewald, 332, c.<p>The visionary candlestick, all of gold, with its seven lamps, is unquestionably a figurative representation of the seven-branched golden candlestick in the tabernacle, and differs from this only in the three following additions which are peculiar to itself: (1) That is has its gulla&#770;h (&#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468; for &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1514;&#1492;, with the feminine termination resolved; cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/13-2.htm">Hosea 13:2</a>, and Ewald, 257, d), i.e., a can or round vessel for the oil, which was omitted altogether from the candlestick of the holy place, when the lamps were filled with oil by the priests, "at the top of it" (&#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;&#1468;); (2) That it had seven mu&#772;tsa&#770;qo&#772;th (pipes) each for the lamps, that is to say, tubes through which the oil poured from the gulla&#770;h into the lamps, or was conducted to them, whereas the candlestick of the tabernacle had no pipes, but only seven arms (qa&#770;n&#305;&#772;m), for the purpose of holding the lamps, which of course could not be wanting in the case of the visionary candlestick, and are merely omitted from the description as being self-evident. The number of the pipes is also a disputed point, viz., whether &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506;&#1492; &#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506;&#1492; means seven and seven, i.e., fourteen, or whether it is to be taken distributively, seven each for the lamps, i.e., seven for each lamp, and therefore forty-nine for the seven. The distributive view is disputed by Hitzig and Koehler as at variance with the usage of the language: the former proposing to alter the text, so as to obtain seven pipes, i.e., one for each lamp; and the latter, on the other hand, assuming that there were fourteen pipes, and inferring from the statement "seven and seven," instead of fourteen, that the second seven are to be sought in a different place from the first, that is to say, that the first seven led from the oil-vessel to the seven different lamps, whilst the second seven connected the seven lamps with one another, which would have been a very strange and perfectly useless provision. But there is no foundation whatever for the assertion that it is at variance with the usage of the language. For although a distributive relation is certainly expressed as a rule by the simple repetition of the number without any connecting Vav, such passages as <a href="/2_samuel/21-20.htm">2 Samuel 21:20</a> and <a href="/1_chronicles/20-6.htm">1 Chronicles 20:6</a> show quite indisputably that the repetition of the same number with the Vav cop. between is also to be taken distributively. When, for example, it is stated in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-20.htm">2 Samuel 21:20</a>, with regard to the hero of Gath, that the fingers of his hands and the fingers (toes) of his feet were "she&#772;sh va&#770;she&#772;sh, four-and-twenty in number," it is evident that she&#772;sh va&#770;she&#772;sh cannot mean "six and six," because six and six do not make twenty-four; and a division of the she&#772;sh between the hands and feet is also untenable, because his two hands had not six fingers on them, but twelve, and so his two feet had not six toes on them, but twelve. Consequently she&#772;sh va&#770;she&#772;sh must be taken distributively: the fingers of his (two) hands and the toes of his (two) feet were six each; for it is only 2 + 2(( equals  4) x 6 that can give 24. This is shown still more clearly in <a href="/1_chronicles/20-6.htm">1 Chronicles 20:6</a> : "and his fingers were she&#772;sh va&#770;she&#772;sh, four-and-twenty." It is in this distributive sense, which is thus thoroughly established, so far as the usage of the language is concerned, that &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506;&#1492; &#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506;&#1492; &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509; is to be taken: seven pipes each for the lamps, i.e., forty-nine for the seven lamps; inasmuch as if fourteen pipes were meant, it would be impossible to imagine any reason why "seven and seven" should be written instead of fourteen. And we cannot be shaken in this conviction, either by the objection "that if there was any proportion between the pipes and the size of the oil-vessel, such a number of pipes could not possibly (?) spring from one oil-can" (Koehler), or by the statement that "forty-nine would be quite as much at variance with the original as fourteen, since that had only one pipe for every lamp" (Hitzig). For the supposed original for the pipes had no existence, inasmuch as the Mosaic candlestick had no pipes at all; and we can form no opinion as to the possibility of forty-nine pipes issuing from one oil-vessel, because we have no information as to the size either of the oil-vessel or of the pipes. (3) The third peculiarity in the visionary candlestick consists in the olive trees on the right and left of the oil-vessel, which supplied it with oil, and whose connection with the candlestick is first described in <a href="/zechariah/4-12.htm">Zechariah 4:12</a>. These three additions which were made to the golden candlestick seen by Zechariah, as contrasted with the golden candlestick of the tabernacle, formed the apparatus through which it was supplied with the oil required to light it continually without the intervention of man. </body></html>
