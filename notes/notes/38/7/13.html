The duties required are, not keeping fasts and offering sacrifices, but doing justly and loving mercy, which tend to the public welfare and peace. The law of God lays restraint upon the heart. But they filled their minds with prejudices against the word of God. Nothing is harder than the heart of a presumptuous sinner. See the fatal consequences of this to their fathers. Great sins against the Lord of hosts, bring great wrath from his power, which cannot be resisted. Sin, if regarded in the heart, will certainly spoil the success of prayer. The Lord always hears the cry of the broken-hearted penitent; yet all who die impenitent and unbelieving, will find no remedy or refuge from miseries which while here they despised and defied, but which they then will not be able to bear.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/zechariah/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And it came to pass - that is, this which God had said, "As He cried and they heard not, so shall they cry and I will not hear, saith the Lord of hosts." God had often said this. "It shall be too late to cry for mercy, when it is the time of justice." So Wisdom had said by Solomon; "then, that is, when distress and anguish cometh upon them, they shall call upon Me, but I will not answer; they shall seek Me early, and they shall not find Me" <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/1-27.htm">Proverbs 1:27-28</a>. So by Isaiah, "When ye spread forth your hands, I will hide Mine eyes from you; yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear; your hands are full of bloods" <a href="/isaiah/1-15.htm">Isaiah 1:15</a>. So by Hosea, <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/5-6.htm">Hosea 5:6</a>, by Micah M<a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-4.htm">1 Corinthians 3:4</a>, by Jeremiah Jer 11:14; <a href="/jeremiah/14-12.htm">Jeremiah 14:12</a>. It was one message which was verilied in every day of chastisement, "there will be a 'too late;'" not a final "too late," until the end of ends comes, but a "too late" for them, a "too late" to avert that particular judgment of God, whereby the sinner's earthly trial and future were changed permanently . <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/zechariah/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. he cried&#8212;by His prophets.<p>they cried&#8212;in their calamities.<p>I &#8230; not hear&#8212;retribution in kind (Pr 1:24-26; Isa 1:15; Mic 3:4).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/zechariah/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Therefore it is come to pass; </span> this is the very cause, and it is just too. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">As he cried; </span> my Spirit by the prophets called, warned, entreated, and urged them to repent, obey, and live, but they would not; so they cried, by fasting and howling in their deep but chosen distress, in the miseries they fell under after Gedaliah’s death, yet <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I would not hear, saith the Lord of hosts.</span> Is it not most just I should disregard their tears for Gedaliah, when after his death they pretended to inquire that they might obey my word, <span class="bld"><a href="/jeremiah/42-2.htm" title="And said to Jeremiah the prophet, Let, we beseech you, our supplication be accepted before you, and pray for us to the LORD your God, even for all this remnant; (for we are left but a few of many, as your eyes do behold us:)">Jeremiah 42:2</a>,3,5,6</span>, yet then they gave my prophet the lie, and contemptuously resolved to do contrary to my word by him, <span class="bld"><a href="/jeremiah/43-4.htm" title="So Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, and all the people, obeyed not the voice of the LORD, to dwell in the land of Judah.">Jeremiah 43:4</a></span>?

"Jehovah is just in the midst of her; does no wrong: morning by morning He sets His justice in the light, not failing; but the unjust knoweth no shame. <a href="/zephaniah/3-6.htm">Zephaniah 3:6</a>. I have cut off nations: their battlements are laid waste; I have devastated their streets, so that no one else passeth over: their cities are laid waste, that there is no man there, not an inhabitant more." <a href="/zephaniah/3-5.htm">Zephaniah 3:5</a> is attached adversatively to what precedes without a particle, in this sense: And yet Jehovah is just beqirba&#770;h, i.e., in the midst of the city filled with sinners. The words recal to mind the description of the divine administration in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-4.htm">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>, where Jehovah is described as &#1488;&#1497;&#1503; &#1506;&#1493;&#1500; and &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;. It follows from this that tsadd&#305;&#772;q is not to be referred to the fact that God does not leave the sins of the nation unpunished (Ros.), but to the fact that He commits no wrong: so that  &#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492;  is only a negative paraphrase of tsadd&#305;&#772;q. His justice, i.e., the righteousness of His conduct, He puts in the light every morning (babbo&#772;qer babbo&#772;qer, used distributively, as in <a href="/exodus/16-21.htm">Exodus 16:21</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/6-5.htm">Leviticus 6:5</a>, etc.), not by rewarding virtue and punishing wickedness (Hitzig, Strauss, after the Chaldee, Jerome, Theodoret, and Cyril), according to which mishpa&#770;t would signify judgment; but by causing His law and justice to be proclaimed to the nation daily "by prophets, whose labour He employs to teach the nation His laws, and who exert themselves diligently by exhorting and admonishing every day, to call it to bring forth better fruit, but all in vain (Ros., Ewald, etc.; cf. <a href="/hosea/6-5.htm">Hosea 6:5</a>). It is at variance with the context to take these words as referring to the judgments of God. These are first spoken of in <a href="//biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-6.htm">Zephaniah 3:6</a>, and the correspondence between these two verses and <a href="/zephaniah/3-7.htm">Zephaniah 3:7</a> and <a href="/zephaniah/3-8.htm">Zephaniah 3:8</a> shows that we must not mix up together <a href="/zephaniah/3-5.htm">Zephaniah 3:5</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-6.htm">Zephaniah 3:6</a>, or interpret <a href="/zephaniah/3-5.htm">Zephaniah 3:5</a> from <a href="/zephaniah/3-6.htm">Zephaniah 3:6</a>. Just as the judgment is threatened there (<a href="/zephaniah/3-8.htm">Zephaniah 3:8</a>) because the people have accepted no correction, and have not allowed themselves to be moved to the fear of Jehovah, so also in <a href="/zephaniah/3-5.htm">Zephaniah 3:5</a> and <a href="/zephaniah/3-6.htm">Zephaniah 3:6</a> the prophet demonstrates the righteousness of God from His double administration: viz., first, from the fact that He causes His justice to be proclaimed to the people, that they may accept correction; and secondly, by pointing to the judgments upon the nations. &#1500;&#1488; &#1504;&#1506;&#1491;&#1468;&#1512; paraphrases the idea of "infallibly;" the literal meaning is, that there is no morning in which the justice is wanting. Hitzig, Strauss, and others have rendered it quite unsuitably, "God does not suffer Himself to be wanting," i.e., does not remain absent. But the perverse one, viz., the nation sunk in unrighteousness, knows no disgrace, to make it ashamed of its misdeeds. In <a href="/zephaniah/3-6.htm">Zephaniah 3:6</a> Jehovah is introduced as speaking, to set before the nations in the most impressive manner the judgments in which He has manifested His righteousness. The two hemistichs are formed uniformly, each consisting of two clauses, in which the direct address alternates with an indefinite, passive construction: I have cut off nations, their battlements have been laid waste, etc. Go&#772;y&#305;&#772;m are neither those nations who are threatened with ruin in <a href="//biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-4.htm">Zephaniah 2:4-15</a>, nor the Canaanites, who have been exterminated by Israel, but nations generally, which have succumbed to the judgments of God, without any more precise definition. Pinno&#772;th, the battlements of the fortress-walls and towers (<a href="/zephaniah/1-16.htm">Zephaniah 1:16</a>), stand per synecdochen for castles or fortifications. Chu&#772;tso&#772;th are not streets of the city, but roads, and stand synecdochically for the flat country. This is required by the correspondence of the clauses. For just as the cities answer to the castles, so do chu&#772;tso&#772;th to the nations. Nitsdu&#772;, from tsa&#770;da&#770;h, not in the sense of waylaying (<a href="/exodus/21-13.htm">Exodus 21:13</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/24-12.htm">1 Samuel 24:12</a>), but in accordance with Aramaean usage, to lay waste, answering to na&#770;shammu&#772;, for which Jeremiah uses nittetsu&#772; in <a href="/jeremiah/4-26.htm">Jeremiah 4:26</a>. </body></html>
