Those who would know God's mind should consult God's ministers; and, in doubtful cases, ask advice of those whose special business it is to search the Scriptures. The Jews seemed to question whether they ought to continue their fasts, seeing that the city and temple were likely to be finished. The first answer to their inquiry is a sharp reproof of hypocrisy. These fasts were not acceptable to God, unless observed in a better manner, and to better purpose. There was the form of duty, but no life, or soul, or power in it. Holy exercises are to be done to God, looking to his word as our rule, and his glory as our end, seeking to please him and obtain his favour; but self was the centre of all their actions. And it was not enough to weep on fast days; they should have searched the Scriptures of the prophets, that they might have seen what was the ground of God's controversy with their fathers. Whether people are in prosperity or adversity, they must be called upon to leave their sins, and to do their duty.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/zechariah/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Should I weep in the fifth month, separating myself? - "In the fifth month," from the seventh to the tenth day, Jerusalem was in flames, fired by Nebuchadnezzar.

Should I weep in the fifth month&#8212;"I" represents here the people of God (compare Zec 8:21). This rather favors Maurer's view, taking "the house of God," the congregation, as nominative to "sent." Their hypocrisy appeared because they showed more concern about a ceremony of human institution (not improper in itself) than about moral obedience. If, too, they had trusted God's promise as to the restoration of Church and State, the fast would have now given place to joy, for which there was more cause than for grief [Pembellus].<p>to the prophets&#8212;Haggai and Zechariah especially.

Whilst &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; refers to what precedes, the next clause in the reason assigned points to the announcement of judgment upon the remaining nations of the earth in <a href="/zephaniah/2-12.htm">Zephaniah 2:12</a>.; so that <a href="/zephaniah/2-11.htm">Zephaniah 2:11</a> cannot be taken either as the conclusion of the previous threat, or as the commencement of the following one, but leads from the one to the other. Jehovah is terrible when He reveals Himself in the majesty of Judge of the world. The suffix appended to &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; does not refer to &#1506;&#1501; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;, but to the &#1500;&#1492;&#1501; in <a href="//biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-10.htm">Zephaniah 2:10</a>, answering to the Moabites and Ammonites. Jehovah proves Himself terrible to these, because He has resolved to destroy all the gods of the earth. Ra&#770;za&#770;h, to make lean; hence to cause to vanish, to destroy. He causes the gods to vanish, by destroying the nations and kingdoms who relied upon these gods. He thereby reveals the nothingness of the gods, and brings the nations to acknowledge His sole deity (<a href="/micah/5-12.htm">Micah 5:12</a>). The fall of the false gods impels to the worship of the one true God. &#1493;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1493;&#1468; &#1500;&#1493; is the consequence, the fruit, and the effect of Jehovah's proving Himself terrible to the nations and their gods. &#1488;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497; &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501;, islands of the Gentiles, is an epithet taken from the islands and coastlands of Europe, to denote the whole of the heathen world (see at <a href="/isaiah/41-1.htm">Isaiah 41:1</a>). The distributive &#1506;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1511;&#1493;&#1502;&#1493; refers to haggo&#772;y&#305;&#772;m as the principal idea, though not in the sense of "every nation," but in that of every individual belonging to the nations. Mimmeqo&#772;mo&#772;, coming from his place: the meaning is not that the nations will worship Jehovah at their own place, in their own lands, in contradistinction to <a href="/micah/4-1.htm">Micah 4:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/14-16.htm">Zechariah 14:16</a>, and other passages, where the nations go on pilgrimage to Mount Zion (Hitzig); but their going to Jerusalem is implied in the min (from), though it is not brought prominently out, as being unessential to the thought. With regard to the fulfilment, Bucer has correctly observed, that "the worship of Jehovah on the part of the heathen is not secured without sanguinary wars, that the type may not be taken for the fact itself, and the shadow for the body .... But the true completion of the whole in the kingdom of Christ takes place here in spirit and in faith, whilst in the future age it will be consummated in all its reality and in full fruition." Theodoret, on the other hand, is too one-sided in his view, and thinks only of the conversion of the heathen through the preaching of the gospel. "This prophecy," he says, "has received its true fulfilment through the holy apostles, and the saints who have followed them; ... and this takes place, not by the law, but by the teaching of the gospel." </body></html>
