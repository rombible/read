The duties required are, not keeping fasts and offering sacrifices, but doing justly and loving mercy, which tend to the public welfare and peace. The law of God lays restraint upon the heart. But they filled their minds with prejudices against the word of God. Nothing is harder than the heart of a presumptuous sinner. See the fatal consequences of this to their fathers. Great sins against the Lord of hosts, bring great wrath from his power, which cannot be resisted. Sin, if regarded in the heart, will certainly spoil the success of prayer. The Lord always hears the cry of the broken-hearted penitent; yet all who die impenitent and unbelieving, will find no remedy or refuge from miseries which while here they despised and defied, but which they then will not be able to bear.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/zechariah/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Harder than adamant - The stone, whatever it be, was hard enough to cut ineffaceable characters : it was harder than flint .

Not through infirmity, but of set purpose, they hardened themselves, lest "they should convert" <a href="/isaiah/6-10.htm">Isaiah 6:10</a> and be healed. They feared to trust themselves to God's word, lest He should convert them by it.<p>Lest they should hear the law and the words which the Lord God sent by His Spirit by the hand of the former prophets - The Holy Spirit was the chief agent; "by His Spirit;" the inspired prophets were His instruments; by the hand of. Nehemiah confesses the same to God: "Thou didst protest to them by Thy Spirit by the hand of Thy prophets" <a href="/nehemiah/9-30.htm">Nehemiah 9:30</a>. Moses was one of the greatest prophets. The law then may be included, either as delivered by Moses, or as being continually enforced by all the prophets. Observe the gradations:<p>(1) The words of God are not heard.<p>(2) The restive shoulder is shown; people turn away, when God, by the inner motions of His Spirit or by lesser chastisements, would bring them to the yoke of obedience.

Osorius: "Their adamantine heart could be softened neither by promises nor threats." Therefore nothing remained but the great wrath, which they had treasured to themselves against the day of wrath. And so Zechariah returns to that, wherewith his message and visions of future mercy began, the great wrath which fell upon their fathers <a href="/zechariah/1-7.htm">Zechariah 1:7</a>.<p>Osorius: "'I sought not,' He says, 'for your tears; I enjoined not bitterness of sorrow; but what, had they been done, the calamity, for which those tears were meet, had never befallen you.

"Jehovah is just in the midst of her; does no wrong: morning by morning He sets His justice in the light, not failing; but the unjust knoweth no shame. <a href="/zephaniah/3-6.htm">Zephaniah 3:6</a>. I have cut off nations: their battlements are laid waste; I have devastated their streets, so that no one else passeth over: their cities are laid waste, that there is no man there, not an inhabitant more." <a href="/zephaniah/3-5.htm">Zephaniah 3:5</a> is attached adversatively to what precedes without a particle, in this sense: And yet Jehovah is just beqirba&#770;h, i.e., in the midst of the city filled with sinners. The words recal to mind the description of the divine administration in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-4.htm">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>, where Jehovah is described as &#1488;&#1497;&#1503; &#1506;&#1493;&#1500; and &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;. It follows from this that tsadd&#305;&#772;q is not to be referred to the fact that God does not leave the sins of the nation unpunished (Ros.), but to the fact that He commits no wrong: so that  &#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492;  is only a negative paraphrase of tsadd&#305;&#772;q. His justice, i.e., the righteousness of His conduct, He puts in the light every morning (babbo&#772;qer babbo&#772;qer, used distributively, as in <a href="/exodus/16-21.htm">Exodus 16:21</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/6-5.htm">Leviticus 6:5</a>, etc.), not by rewarding virtue and punishing wickedness (Hitzig, Strauss, after the Chaldee, Jerome, Theodoret, and Cyril), according to which mishpa&#770;t would signify judgment; but by causing His law and justice to be proclaimed to the nation daily "by prophets, whose labour He employs to teach the nation His laws, and who exert themselves diligently by exhorting and admonishing every day, to call it to bring forth better fruit, but all in vain (Ros., Ewald, etc.; cf. <a href="/hosea/6-5.htm">Hosea 6:5</a>). It is at variance with the context to take these words as referring to the judgments of God. These are first spoken of in <a href="//biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-6.htm">Zephaniah 3:6</a>, and the correspondence between these two verses and <a href="/zephaniah/3-7.htm">Zephaniah 3:7</a> and <a href="/zephaniah/3-8.htm">Zephaniah 3:8</a> shows that we must not mix up together <a href="/zephaniah/3-5.htm">Zephaniah 3:5</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-6.htm">Zephaniah 3:6</a>, or interpret <a href="/zephaniah/3-5.htm">Zephaniah 3:5</a> from <a href="/zephaniah/3-6.htm">Zephaniah 3:6</a>. Just as the judgment is threatened there (<a href="/zephaniah/3-8.htm">Zephaniah 3:8</a>) because the people have accepted no correction, and have not allowed themselves to be moved to the fear of Jehovah, so also in <a href="/zephaniah/3-5.htm">Zephaniah 3:5</a> and <a href="/zephaniah/3-6.htm">Zephaniah 3:6</a> the prophet demonstrates the righteousness of God from His double administration: viz., first, from the fact that He causes His justice to be proclaimed to the people, that they may accept correction; and secondly, by pointing to the judgments upon the nations. &#1500;&#1488; &#1504;&#1506;&#1491;&#1468;&#1512; paraphrases the idea of "infallibly;" the literal meaning is, that there is no morning in which the justice is wanting. Hitzig, Strauss, and others have rendered it quite unsuitably, "God does not suffer Himself to be wanting," i.e., does not remain absent. But the perverse one, viz., the nation sunk in unrighteousness, knows no disgrace, to make it ashamed of its misdeeds. In <a href="/zephaniah/3-6.htm">Zephaniah 3:6</a> Jehovah is introduced as speaking, to set before the nations in the most impressive manner the judgments in which He has manifested His righteousness. The two hemistichs are formed uniformly, each consisting of two clauses, in which the direct address alternates with an indefinite, passive construction: I have cut off nations, their battlements have been laid waste, etc. Go&#772;y&#305;&#772;m are neither those nations who are threatened with ruin in <a href="//biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-4.htm">Zephaniah 2:4-15</a>, nor the Canaanites, who have been exterminated by Israel, but nations generally, which have succumbed to the judgments of God, without any more precise definition. Pinno&#772;th, the battlements of the fortress-walls and towers (<a href="/zephaniah/1-16.htm">Zephaniah 1:16</a>), stand per synecdochen for castles or fortifications. Chu&#772;tso&#772;th are not streets of the city, but roads, and stand synecdochically for the flat country. This is required by the correspondence of the clauses. For just as the cities answer to the castles, so do chu&#772;tso&#772;th to the nations. Nitsdu&#772;, from tsa&#770;da&#770;h, not in the sense of waylaying (<a href="/exodus/21-13.htm">Exodus 21:13</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/24-12.htm">1 Samuel 24:12</a>), but in accordance with Aramaean usage, to lay waste, answering to na&#770;shammu&#772;, for which Jeremiah uses nittetsu&#772; in <a href="/jeremiah/4-26.htm">Jeremiah 4:26</a>. </body></html>
