To this inquiry, the prophet is directed in these chapters how to answer; and his answer is given not all at once, but, as it seems, by piece-meal, and at several times. For here are four distinct discourses that have reference to this case. <span class="ital">In the fourth day of the ninth month, even in Chisleu — </span>This month corresponded with the latter part of our November and the beginning of December. <span class="ital">When they had sent </span>— The Hebrew verb here used is in the singular number, <span class="ital">he had sent, </span>or <span class="ital">one had sent: </span>but our translators very properly interpret it plurally, by the figure termed an enallage of the number, which is often used in the Hebrew; and the Vulgate renders it in the same sense. This is understood by some to be spoken of the Jews who still remained in Chaldea; but it seems more probable that those are meant who dwelt in the towns or villages at some distance from Jerusalem. <span class="ital">These sent unto the house of God — </span>That, is unto the temple, where the building was still carried on with success; <span class="ital">Sherezer and Regem-melech — </span>Men of note among them; <span class="ital">and their men — </span>Servants, or persons of less rank, who accompanied them; <span class="ital">to pray before the Lord — </span>To offer up prayers for themselves and their friends. The temple was the only place where they could offer sacrifices and oblations, to which solemn prayers were always wont to be joined. <span class="ital">And to speak unto the priests and prophets — </span>It was the office of the priests to resolve any doubts that might arise respecting the worship of God, or any part of his law, whether moral or ceremonial, and the people were commanded to consult them, and to act according to their determination. And since the Prophets Haggai and Zechariah were at this time residing in Jerusalem, it was proper to inquire of them, who might probably give them an immediate answer to their inquiry from God himself. <span class="ital">Should I weep in the fifth month — </span>The fast in the fifth month was kept because in that month, answering to our month of July, the city and temple were burned by the Chaldeans, <a href="/2_kings/25-8.htm" title="And in the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month, which is the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon, to Jerusalem:">2 Kings 25:8</a>; in memory of which grievous judgment, the people instituted a solemn fast, which, it appears, they had observed from that time until the times here spoken of; refraining from all worldly business and pleasure, and employing themselves in the religious exercise of prayer and humiliation: see <a href="/context/zechariah/12-12.htm" title="And the land shall mourn, every family apart; the family of the house of David apart, and their wives apart; the family of the house of Nathan apart, and their wives apart;...">Zechariah 12:12-14</a>. The question they now proposed, was, whether it were proper for them still to continue this fast, when the ecclesiastical and civil state was in a great measure restored, and the judgment for which they mourned was removed.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/zechariah/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:1-7 If we truly desire to know the will of God in doubtful matters, we must not only consult his word and ministers, but seek his direction by fervent prayer. Those who would know God's mind should consult God's ministers; and, in doubtful cases, ask advice of those whose special business it is to search the Scriptures. The Jews seemed to question whether they ought to continue their fasts, seeing that the city and temple were likely to be finished. The first answer to their inquiry is a sharp reproof of hypocrisy. These fasts were not acceptable to God, unless observed in a better manner, and to better purpose. There was the form of duty, but no life, or soul, or power in it. Holy exercises are to be done to God, looking to his word as our rule, and his glory as our end, seeking to please him and obtain his favour; but self was the centre of all their actions. And it was not enough to weep on fast days; they should have searched the Scriptures of the prophets, that they might have seen what was the ground of God's controversy with their fathers. Whether people are in prosperity or adversity, they must be called upon to leave their sins, and to do their duty.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/zechariah/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In the fourth year of Darius - Two years after the series of visions, shown to him, and two years before the completion of the temple.

Keil connects the last clause, which gives the day of the month, with the next verse; but this is against the traditional accentuation, and is not required by the wording of ver. 2. The prophet first gives the date generally when the word came to him, and then defines it more accurately. <span class="cmt_word">Chisleu</span>; <span class="accented">Chislev</span> (<a href="/nehemiah/1-1.htm">Nehemiah 1:1</a>).

"I have heard the abuse of Moab, and the revilings of the sons of Ammon, who have abused my nation, and boasted against its boundary. <a href="/zephaniah/2-9.htm">Zephaniah 2:9</a>. Therefore, as I live, is the saying of Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Yea, Moab shall become like Sodom, and the sons of Ammon like Gomorrha, an inheritance of nettles and salt-pits, and desert for ever. The remnant of my nation will plunder them, the residue of my nation will inherit them. <a href="/zephaniah/2-10.htm">Zephaniah 2:10</a>. Such to them for their pride, that they have despised and boasted against the nation of Jehovah of hosts." The threat now turns from the Philistines in the west to the two tribes to the east, viz., the Moabites and Ammonites, who were descended from Lot, and therefore blood-relations, and who manifested hostility to Israel on every possible occasion. Even in the time of Moses, the Moabitish king Balak sought to destroy Israel by means of Balaam's curses (<a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/22.htm">Numbers 22</a>), for which the Moabites were threatened with extermination (<a href="/numbers/24-17.htm">Numbers 24:17</a>). In the time of the judges they both attempted to oppress Israel (<a href="/judges/3-12.htm">Judges 3:12</a>. and <a href="/judges/10-7.htm">Judges 10:7</a>.; cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-1.htm">1 Samuel 11:1-5</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/10.htm">2 Samuel 10-12</a>), for which they were severely punished by Saul and David (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-47.htm">1 Samuel 14:47</a>, and <a href="/2_samuel/8-2.htm">2 Samuel 8:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-30.htm">2 Samuel 12:30-31</a>). The reproach of Moab and the revilings of the Ammonites, which Jehovah had heard, cannot be taken, as Jerome, Rashi, and others suppose, as referring to the hostilities of those tribes towards the Judaeans during the Chaldaean catastrophe; nor restricted, as v. Clln imagines, to the reproaches heaped upon the ten tribes when they were carried away by the Assyrians, since nothing is know of any such reproaches. The charge refers to the hostile attitude assumed by both tribes at all times towards the nation of God, which they manifested both in word and deed, as often as the latter was brought into trouble and distress. Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-26.htm">Jeremiah 48:26-27</a>; and for gidde&#772;ph, to revile or blaspheme by actions, <a href="/numbers/15-30.htm">Numbers 15:30</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/20-27.htm">Ezekiel 20:27</a>; also for the fact itself, the remarks on <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/1-13.htm">Amos 1:13-2:3</a>. &#1497;&#1490;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; &#1506;&#1500; &#1490;&#1489;, they did great things against their (the Israelites') border (the suffix in gebhu&#772;la&#770;m, their border, refers to &#8219;amm&#305;&#772;, my people). This great doing consisted in their proudly violating the boundary of Israel, and endeavouring to seize upon Israelitish territory (cf. <a href="/amos/1-13.htm">Amos 1:13</a>). Pride and haughtiness, or high-minded self-exaltation above Israel as the nation of God, is charged against the Moabites and Ammonites by Isaiah and Jeremiah also, as a leading feature in their character (cf. <a href="/isaiah/16-6.htm">Isaiah 16:6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/25-11.htm">Isaiah 25:11</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-29.htm">Jeremiah 48:29-30</a>). Moab and Ammon are to be utterly exterminated in consequence. The threat of punishment is announced in <a href="/zephaniah/2-8.htm">Zephaniah 2:8</a> as irrevocable by a solemn oath. It shall happen to them as to Sodom and Gomorrha. This simile was rendered a very natural one by the situation of the two lands in the neighbourhood of the Dead Sea. It affirms the utter destruction of the two tribes, as the appositional description shows. Their land is to become the possession of nettles, i.e., a place where nettles grow. Mimsha&#770;q, hap leg., from the root ma&#770;shaq, which was not used, but from which mesheq in <a href="/genesis/15-2.htm">Genesis 15:2</a> is derived. Cha&#770;ru&#772;l: the stinging nettle (see at <a href="/job/30-7.htm">Job 30:7</a>), which only flourishes in waste places. Mikhre&#772;h melach: a place of salt-pits, like the southern coast of the Dead Sea, which abounds in rock-salt, and to which there is an allusion in the threat of Moses in <a href="/deuteronomy/29-22.htm">Deuteronomy 29:22</a>. "A desert for ever:" the emphasis lies upon &#8219;ad &#8219;o&#772;la&#770;m (for ever) here. The people, however, i.e., the Moabites and Ammonites themselves, will be taken by the people of Jehovah, and be made their possession. The suffixes attached to &#1497;&#1489;&#1494;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; and &#1497;&#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; can only refer to the people of Moab and Ammon, because a land turned into an eternal desert and salt-steppe would not be adapted for a nacha&#774;la&#770;h (possession) for the people of God. The meaning is not, they will be their heirs through the medium of plunder, but they will make them into their own property, or slaves (cf. <a href="/isaiah/14-2.htm">Isaiah 14:2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/61-5.htm">Isaiah 61:5</a>). &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1497; is &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497; with the suffix of the first person, only one of the two &#1497; being written. In <a href="/zephaniah/2-10.htm">Zephaniah 2:10</a> the threat concludes with a repetition of the statement of the guilt which is followed by such a judgment.<p>The fulfilment or realization of the threat pronounced upon Philistia, Moab, and Ammon, we have not to look for in the particular historical occurrences through which these tribes were conquered and subjugated by the Chaldaeans, and to some extent by the Jews after the captivity, until they eventually vanished from the stage of history, and their lands became desolate, as they still are. These events can only come into consideration as preliminary stages of the fulfilment, which Zephaniah completely passes by, since he only views the judgment in its ultimate fulfilment. We are precluded, moreover, from taking the words as relating to that event by the circumstance, that neither Philistia on the one hand, nor Moabites and Ammonites on the other, were ever taken permanent possession of by the Jews; and still less were they ever taken by Judah, as the nation of God, for His own property. Judah is not to enter into such possession as this till the Lord turns the captivity of Judah (<a href="/zephaniah/2-7.htm">Zephaniah 2:7</a>); that is to say, not immediately after the return from the Babylonish captivity, but when the dispersion of Israel among the Gentiles, which lasts till this day, shall come to an end, and Israel, through its conversion to Christ, be reinstated in the privileges of the people of God. It follows from this, that the fulfilment is still in the future, and that it will be accomplished not literally, but spiritually, in the utter destruction of the nations referred to as heathen nations, and opponents of the kingdom of God, and in the incorporation of those who are converted to the living God at the time of the judgment, into the citizenship of the spiritual Israel. Until the eventual restoration of Israel, Philistia will remain an uninhabited shepherds' pasture, and the land of the Moabites and Ammonites the possession of nettles, a place of salt-pits and a desert; just as the land of Israel will for the very same time be trodden down by the Gentiles. The curse resting upon these lands will not be entirely removed till the completion of the kingdom of God on earth. This view is proved to be correct by the contents of <a href="//biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-11.htm">Zephaniah 2:11</a>, with which the prophet passes to the announcement of the judgment upon the nations of the south and north. </body></html>
