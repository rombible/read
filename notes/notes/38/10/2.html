Seasonable rain is a great mercy, which we may ask of God when there is most need of it, and we may look for it to come. We must in our prayers ask for mercies in their proper time. The Lord would make bright clouds, and give showers of rain. This may be an exhortation to seek the influences of the Holy Spirit, in faith and by prayer, through which the blessings held forth in the promises are obtained and enjoyed. The prophet shows the folly of making addresses to idols, as their fathers had done. The Lord visited the remnant of his flock in mercy, and was about to renew their courage and strength for conflict and victory. Every creature is to us what God makes it to be. Every one raised to support the nation, as a corner-stone does the building, or to unite those that differ, as nails join the different timbers, must come from the Lord; and those employed to overcome their enemies, must have strength and success from him. This may be applied to Christ; to him we must look to raise up persons to unite, support, and defend his people.

He appeals to their former experience. Their father had sought of idols, not of God; therefore they went into captivity. The "teraphim" were used as instruments of divination.

It was probably, a superstition of Eastern origin. Rachel brought them with her from her father's house, and Nebuchadnezzar used them for divination. <a href="/ezekiel/21-21.htm">Ezekiel 21:21</a>. Samuel speaks of them, apparently, as things which Saul himself condemned. "Rebellion is as the sin of divination, and stubbornness as iniquity or idolatry, and teraphim" <a href="/1_samuel/15-23.htm">1 Samuel 15:23</a>. For it was probably in those his better days, that "Saul had put away those that had familiar spirits and wizards out of the land" <a href="/1_samuel/28-3.htm">1 Samuel 28:3</a>. Samuel then seems to tell him, that the sins to which he clave were as evil as those which he had, in an outward zeal, like Jehu, condemned.

"They were troubled." The trouble lasted on, though the captivity ended at the appointed time. Nehemiah speaks of the exactions of former governors, "The former governors which were before me, laid heavy weights upon the people, and took from them in bread and wine, after forty shekels of silver; also their servants used dominion over the people; and I did not so, because of the fear of God" <a href="/nehemiah/5-15.htm">Nehemiah 5:15</a>.<p>Because there was no shepherd - As Ezekiel said of those times, "They were scattered, because there is no shepherd; and they became meat to all the beasts of the field, when they were scattered: My flock was scattered upon all the face of the earth; and none did search or seek after them" <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-5.htm">Ezekiel 34:5-6</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/zechariah/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. idols&#8212;literally, "the teraphim," the household gods, consulted in divination (see on [1187]Ho 3:4).

"Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, Ask now the priests for instruction, saying, <a href="/haggai/2-12.htm">Haggai 2:12</a>. Behold, one carries holy flesh in the lappet of his garment, and touches with his lappet the bread, and that which is boiled, the wine, and the oil, and any kind of food: does it then become holy? And the priests answered and said, No. <a href="/haggai/2-13.htm">Haggai 2:13</a>. And Haggai said, If one who is unclean on account of a corpse touches all this, does it become unclean? And the priests answered and said, It does become unclean. <a href="/haggai/2-14.htm">Haggai 2:14</a>. Then Haggai answered and said, So is this people, and so this nation before my face, is the saying of Jehovah; and so is all the work of their hands, and what they offer to me there: it is unclean." In order to impress most earnestly upon the hearts of the people the fact that it was through their sin that they brought upon themselves the failure of crops that had hitherto prevailed, viz., as a punishment from God, the prophet proposes two questions concerning holy and clean for the priests to answer, in order that he may make an application of the answer they give to the moral condition of the nation. To&#772;ra&#770;h in <a href="//biblehub.com/haggai/2-11.htm">Haggai 2:11</a>, without the article, is used in its primary signification of instruction, and is governed by &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1500;, accus. rei: to ask a person anything, for to ask or solicit anything from him. The first question has reference to the communication of the holiness of holy objects to other objects brought into contact with them: whether, if a person carried holy flesh in the lappet of his garment,<p>(Note: Luther: "in the geren of his dress." The gehren, or gehre, middle high German gre, old high German kro (English goar), is a triangular piece, forming the gusset of a dress or shirt, then that portion of the dress in which it is inserted, viz., below the waist, probably derived from the Gothic gis, and the conjectural root geisan  equals  to thrust or strike (Weigand, Germ. Dict.).)<p>and touched any food with the lappet, it would become holy in consequence. He&#772;n, behold, pointing to an action as possible, has almost the force of a conditional particle, "if," as in <a href="/isaiah/54-15.htm">Isaiah 54:15</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/3-1.htm">Jeremiah 3:1</a> (cf.

The priests answer the question laid before them quite correctly with "No;" for, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/6-20.htm">Leviticus 6:20</a>, the lappet of the dress itself was made holy by the holy flesh, but it could not communicate this holiness any further. The second question (<a href="/haggai/2-13.htm">Haggai 2:13</a>) has reference to the spread of legal defilement. &#1496;&#1502;&#1488; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; is not one who is unclean in his soul; but, as <a href="/leviticus/22-4.htm">Leviticus 22:4</a> shows, it is synonymous with &#1496;&#1502;&#1488; &#1500;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; in <a href="/numbers/5-2.htm">Numbers 5:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/9-10.htm">Numbers 9:10</a>, "defiled on a soul;" and this is a contraction of &#1496;&#1502;&#1488; &#1500;&#1504;&#1508;&#1512; &#1488;&#1491;&#1501;, or &#1496;&#1502;&#1488; &#1500;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; &#1502;&#1514;, in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/9-6.htm">Numbers 9:6-7</a>, "defiled on (through) the soul of a dead man" (<a href="/numbers/6-6.htm">Numbers 6:6</a>; <a href="/leviticus/21-11.htm">Leviticus 21:11</a> : see at <a href="/leviticus/19-28.htm">Leviticus 19:28</a>), hence one who has been defiled through touching a dead body. This uncleanness was one of the strongest kinds; it lasted seven days, and could only be removed by his being twice purified with sprinkling water, prepared from the ashes of the red cow (see at <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/19.htm">Numbers 19</a>). This question the priests also answered correctly. According to <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/19-22.htm">Numbers 19:22</a>, he who was defiled by touching a dead body made everything unclean that he touched. The prophet now applies these provisions of the law to the ethical relation in which the people stood to Jehovah. "So is this people before me, saith Jehovah." &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497; is quite synonymous with &#1492;&#1506;&#1501;, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-9.htm">Zephaniah 2:9</a>, without any subordinate meaning of a contemptuous kind, which could at the most be contained in hazzeh (this), but in that case would apply to ha&#770;&#8219;a&#770;m just as well. Ke&#772;n, ita, refers to the substance of the two legal questions in <a href="/haggai/2-12.htm">Haggai 2:12</a> and <a href="/haggai/2-13.htm">Haggai 2:13</a>. The nation, in its attitude towards the Lord, resembles, on the one hand, a man who carries holy flesh in the lappet of his garment, and on the other hand, a man who has become unclean through touching a corpse. "Israel also possesses a sanctuary in the midst of its land, - namely, the place which Jehovah has chosen for His own abode, and favoured with many glorious promises. But just as no kind of food, neither bread nor vegetables, neither wine nor oil, is sanctified by the fact that a man touches it with his sanctified garment, so will all this not be rendered holy by the fact that it is planted in the soil of the land which surrounds and encloses the sanctuary of Jehovah. For though the land itself becomes a holy land in consequence, it cannot spread this holiness any further, nor communicate it to what grows upon it. All that Israel raises on its holy land, whether corn, wine, or oil, remains unholy or common. No special blessing rests upon the fruits of this land, on account of the holiness of the land itself, so as of necessity to produce fruitfulness as its result; nor, on the other hand, does it in itself communicate any curse. But if, as experience shows, a curse is resting notwithstanding upon the productions of this land, it arises from the fact that they are unclean because Israel has planted them. For Israel it utterly unclean on account of its neglect of the house of Jehovah, like a man who has become unclean through touching a corpse. Everything that Israel takes hold of, or upon which it lays its hand, everything that it plants and cultivates, is from the very first affected with the curse of uncleanness; and consequently even the sacrifices which it offers there upon the altar of Jehovah are unclean" (Koehler). Sha&#770;m, there, i.e., upon the altar built immediately after the return from Babylon (<a href="/ezra/3-3.htm">Ezra 3:3</a>). </body></html>
