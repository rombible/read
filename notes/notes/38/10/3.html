Seasonable rain is a great mercy, which we may ask of God when there is most need of it, and we may look for it to come. We must in our prayers ask for mercies in their proper time. The Lord would make bright clouds, and give showers of rain. This may be an exhortation to seek the influences of the Holy Spirit, in faith and by prayer, through which the blessings held forth in the promises are obtained and enjoyed. The prophet shows the folly of making addresses to idols, as their fathers had done. The Lord visited the remnant of his flock in mercy, and was about to renew their courage and strength for conflict and victory. Every creature is to us what God makes it to be. Every one raised to support the nation, as a corner-stone does the building, or to unite those that differ, as nails join the different timbers, must come from the Lord; and those employed to overcome their enemies, must have strength and success from him. This may be applied to Christ; to him we must look to raise up persons to unite, support, and defend his people.

Some commentators raise "the shepherds" to be the rulers of Israel civil and ecclesiastical, comparing <a href="/ezekiel/34-2.htm">Ezekiel 34:2, 5</a>, etc. But the context leads us to consider them as those who took the place of rulers of Israel when she had no shepherd of her own (ver. 2). <span class="cmt_word">I punished</span> (<span class="accented">will punish</span>) <span class="cmt_word">the goats</span> (<span class="accented">bellwethers</span>); literally, <span class="accented">will visit upon</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> will chastise.

The "goats" are the leading men, those powerful for evil, as <a href="/isaiah/14-9.htm">Isaiah 14:9</a>. Hath visited his flock. The reason why the evil shepherds are punished is because God visits his flock in love and care, to see their state and to relieve them from trouble (<a href="/zephaniah/2-7.htm">Zephaniah 2:7</a>).

So he said before (<a href="/zechariah/9-13.htm">Zechariah 9:13</a>) that he would make Judah his bow and Ephraim his arrow. (For a description of the war horse, see <a href="/job/39-19.htm">Job 39:19-25</a>; comp. <a href="/revelation/6-2.htm">Revelation 6:2</a>; <a href="/revelation/19-14.htm">Revelation 19:14</a>, where Christ is represented riding on a white horse, and his saints following him on white horses.) <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/haggai/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The prophet explains these words in <a href="//biblehub.com/haggai/2-15.htm">Haggai 2:15-19</a> by representing the failure of the crops, and the curse that has hitherto prevailed, as a punishment from God for having been wanting in faithfulness to the Lord (<a href="//biblehub.com/haggai/2-15.htm">Haggai 2:15-17</a>), and promises that from that time forward the blessing of God shall rest upon them again (<a href="//biblehub.com/haggai/2-18.htm">Haggai 2:18</a>, <a href="/haggai/2-19.htm">Haggai 2:19</a>). <a href="/haggai/2-15.htm">Haggai 2:15</a>. "And now, direct your heart from this day and onward, before stone was laid to stone at the temple of Jehovah. <a href="/haggai/2-16.htm">Haggai 2:16</a>. Before this was, did one come to the heap of sheaves of twenty-(in measure), there were ten: did he come to the vat to draw fifty buckets, there were twenty. <a href="/haggai/2-17.htm">Haggai 2:17</a>. I have smitten you with blasting, and with mildew, and with hail, all the work of your hands; and not one of you (turned) to me, is the saying of Jehovah." The object to which they are to direct their heart, i.e., to give heed, is not to be supplied from <a href="//biblehub.com/haggai/1-5.htm">Haggai 1:5</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/haggai/1-7.htm">Haggai 1:7</a>, "to your ways" (Ros. and others), but is contained substantially in <a href="/haggai/2-16.htm">Haggai 2:16</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/haggai/2-17.htm">Haggai 2:17</a>, and is first of all indicated in the words "from this day," etc. They are to notice what has taken place from this day onwards. &#1504;&#1502;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492;, lit., upwards, then further on. Here it is used not in the sense of forwards into the future, but, as the explanatory clause which follows (from before, etc.) clearly shows, in that of backwards into the past. Mitterem, literally "from the not yet of the laying ... onwards," i.e., onwards from the time when stone was laid upon stone at the temple; in other words, when the building of the temple was resumed, backwards into the past; in reality, therefore, the time before the resuming of the building of the temple: for min and mitterem cannot be taken in any other sense than in the parallel &#1502;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1501; which precedes it, and &#1502;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501; which follows in <a href="/haggai/2-16.htm">Haggai 2:16</a>. The objection which Koehler raises to this cannot be sustained. &#1502;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501;, from their existence (backwards). Most of the modern commentators take the suffix as referring to a noun, ya&#770;m&#305;&#772;m (days), to be supplied from <a href="/haggai/2-15.htm">Haggai 2:15</a>; but it appears much simpler to take it as a neuter, as Mark and others do, in the sense of "before these things were or were done, viz., this day, and this work of laying stone upon stone," etc. The meaning is not doubtful, viz., looking backwards from the time when the building of the temple was resumed, in other words, before the point of time. &#1489;&#1468;&#1488; commences a new sentence, in which facts that they had experienced are cited, the verb &#1489;&#1468;&#1488; being used conditionally, and forming the protasis, the apodosis to which is given in &#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1514;&#1492;. If one came to a heap of sheaves of twenty measures (se'a&#770;h is probably to be supplied: lxx &#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;), they became ten. A heap of sheaves (&#8219;a&#774;re&#772;ma&#770;h as in <a href="/ruth/3-7.htm">Ruth 3:7</a>), from which they promised themselves twenty measures, yielded, when threshed, no more than ten, i.e., only the half of what they expected. They experienced just the same at the pressing of the grapes. Instead of fifty buckets, which they expected, they obtained only twenty. Yeqebh was the vat into which the juice flowed when pressed out of the grapes. Cha&#770;saph, lit., to lay bare, here to draw out, as in <a href="/isaiah/30-14.htm">Isaiah 30:14</a>; and pu&#772;ra&#770;h, in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/63-3.htm">Isaiah 63:3</a>, the pressing-trough, here a measure, probably the measure which was generally obtained from one filling of the wine-press with grapes (lxx &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c2;). <a href="/haggai/2-17.htm">Haggai 2:17</a> gives the reason why so small a result was yielded by the threshing-floor and wine-press. Jehovah smote you with blasting and mildew. These words are a reminiscence of <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/4-9.htm">Amos 4:9</a>, to which passage the last words of the verse also refer. To the disease of the corn there is also added the hail which smote the vines, as in <a href="/psalms/78-47.htm">Psalm 78:47</a>. 'Eth kol-ma&#8219;a&#774;se&#772;h, all the labour of the hands, i.e., all that they had cultivated with great toil, is a second accusative, "which mentions the portion smitten" (Hitzig). The perfectly unusual construction &#1488;&#1497;&#1503;&#1470;&#1488;&#1514;&#1499;&#1501; &#1488;&#1500;&#1497; does not stand for &#1488;&#1497;&#1503; &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1501; &#1488;, non fuit in vobis qui (Vulg.), nor is &#1488;&#1514;&#1499;&#1501; used for &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1499;&#1501;, "with you;" but &#1488;&#1497;&#1503;&#1470;&#1488;&#1514;&#1499;&#1501; either stands for &#1488;&#1497;&#1504;&#1499;&#1501;, the suffix which was taken as a verbal suffix used as an accusative being resolved into the accusative (cf. Ewald, 262, d); or it is the accusative used in the place of the subject, that is to say, &#1488;&#1514; is to be taken in the sense of "as regards," quoad (Ewald, 277, p. 683): "as far as you are concerned, there was not (one) turning himself to me." &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;, to me, sc. turning himself or being converted; though there is no necessity to supply &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501;, as the idea is implied in the word &#1488;&#1500;, as in <a href="/hosea/3-3.htm">Hosea 3:3</a> and <a href="/2_kings/6-11.htm">2 Kings 6:11</a>. </body></html>
