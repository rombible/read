To this only can the first three verses of this chapter relate; for no calamities happened to that people, from the time of Zechariah till that event, of which the expressions here used can with propriety be understood. Lebanon itself cannot be here addressed, which had no doors or gates: but it is figuratively put, either for the temple, built of the cedars of Lebanon, as it is <a href="/ezekiel/17-3.htm" title="And say, Thus said the Lord GOD; A great eagle with great wings, long winged, full of feathers, which had divers colors, came to Lebanon, and took the highest branch of the cedar:">Ezekiel 17:3</a>; and <a href="/habakkuk/2-17.htm" title="For the violence of Lebanon shall cover you, and the spoil of beasts, which made them afraid, because of men's blood, and for the violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein.">Habakkuk 2:17</a>; or for the city of Jerusalem, whose lofty buildings resembled the stately ranks of trees in a forest: but the former is more probably intended. And, if the Jewish writers may be credited, such was the application made of this prophecy by the Rabbi Johanan, when the doors of the temple opened of their own accord, a little before the temple was burned, a circumstance attested by Josephus, <span class="ital">Bell.

How can the fir trees stand, if the cedars fall? The falls of the wise and good into sin, and the falls of the rich and great into trouble, are loud alarms to those every way their inferiors. It is sad with a people, when those who should be as shepherds to them, are as young lions. The pride of Jordan was the thickets on the banks; and when the river overflowed the banks, the lions came up from them roaring.

The center and source of her strength was the worship of God; and so Lebanon has of old been understood to be the temple, which was built with cedars of Lebanon, towering aloft upon a strong. summit; the spiritual glory and the eminence of Jerusalem, as Lebanon was of the whole country, and , "to strangers who came to it, it appeared from afar like a mountain full of snow; for, where it was not gilded, it was exceeding white, being built of marble." But at the time of destruction it was "a den of thieves" <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/21-13.htm">Matthew 21:13</a>, as Lebanon, amidst its beauty, was of wild beasts.<p>Rup.: "I suppose Lebanon itself, that is, "the temple," felt the command of the prophet's words, since, as its destruction approached, its doors opened without the hand of man. Josephus relates how , "at the passover, the eastern gate of the inner temple, being of brass and very firm, and with difficulty shut at eventide by twenty men; moreover with bars strengthened with iron, and having very deep bolts, which went down into the threshold, itself of one stone, was seen at six o'clock at night to open of its own accord. The guards of the temple running told it to the officer, and he, going up, with difficulty closed it. This the uninstructed thought a very favorable sign, that God opened to them the gate of all goods. But those taught in the divine words, understood that the safety of the temple was removed of itself, and that the gate opened."<p>A saying of this sort is still exstant. : "Our fathers have handed down, forty years before the destruction of the house, the lot of the Lord did not come up on the right hand, and the tongue of splendor did not become white, nor did the light from the evening burn, and the doors of the temple opened of their own accord, until Rabbi Johanan ben Zaccai rebuked them, and said, 'O temple, why dost thou affright thyself? I know of thee that thy end is to be destroyed, and of this Zechariah prophesied, "Open thy doors, O Lebanon, and let the fire devour thy cedars.'" The "forty years" mentioned in this tradition carry back the event exactly to the Death of Christ, the temple having been burned 73 a.d. . Josephus adds that they opened at the passover, the season of His Crucifixion. On the other hand, the shutting of the gates of the temple, when they had "seized Paul and dragged him out of the temple" <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/21-30.htm">Acts 21:30</a>, seems miraculous and significant, that, having thus violently refused the preaching of the Gospel, and cast Paul out, they themselves were also shut out, denoting that an entrance was afterward to be refused them.<p>And let afire devour thy cedars - Jerusalem, or the temple, were, after those times, burned by the Romans only. The destruction of pride, opposed to Christ, was prophesied by Isaiah in connection with His Coming <a href="/isaiah/10-34.htm">Isaiah 10:34</a>; <a href="/isaiah/11-1.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/zechariah/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 11<p>Zec 11:1-17.

Open thy doors, O Lebanon&#8212;that is, the temple so called, as being constructed of cedars of Lebanon, or as being lofty and conspicuous like that mountain (compare Eze 17:3; Hab 2:17). Forty years before the destruction of the temple, the tract called "Massecheth Joma" states, its doors of their own accord opened, and Rabbi Johanan in alarm said, I know that thy desolation is impending according to Zechariah's prophecy. Calvin supposes Lebanon to refer to Judea, described by its north boundary: "Lebanon," the route by which the Romans, according to Josephus, gradually advanced towards Jerusalem. Moore, from Hengstenberg, refers the passage to the civil war which caused the calling in of the Romans, who, like a storm sweeping through the land from Lebanon, deprived Judea of its independence. Thus the passage forms a fit introduction to the prediction as to Messiah born when Judea became a Roman province.

Lebanon, a high and great mountain, boundary between Judea and its neighbours on the north, is here spoken to open its gates, its fortifications, raised to secure the passages, which through the hollownesses of the mountain, the deep and dismal straits, lead into Judea, and would be first attempted by the enemy that first invades the northern parts of Judea.

In the path of the invading army stands Lebanon, at once the pride and bulwark of the land. As the priestly herald of the approaching host (<span class="ital">quasi esset Dei fetialis</span>, Calv.), the prophet summons it to open wide an access, and to surrender to the reckless torch of the fierce foe its goodly pines and noble cedars.

The sin that occasions this chastisement, viz. the rejection of their Shepherd and King, is denounced later (&sect; 9). Lebanon stood in the path of an invader from the north, whence most hostile armies entered Palestine. The "doors" of Lebanon are the mountain passes which gave access to the country. Some commentators, following an old Jewish interpretation, take Lebanon to mean the temple or Jerusalem; but we are constrained to adhere primarily to the literal signification by the difficulty of carrying on the metaphorical allusions in the following clauses. <span class="cmt_word">That the fire may devour thy cedars.</span> That the invader may wantonly destroy thy trees which are thy glory and thy boast. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/zechariah/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The first word of the Lord was addressed to the prophet Zechariah in the eighth month of the second year of the reign of Darius, and therefore about two months after Haggai's first prophecy and the commencement of the rebuilding of the temple, which that prophecy was intended to promote (compare <a href="/zechariah/1-1.htm">Zechariah 1:1</a> with <a href="/haggai/1-1.htm">Haggai 1:1</a> and <a href="/haggai/1-15.htm">Haggai 1:15</a>), and a few weeks after Haggai's prophecy of the great glory which the new temple would receive (<a href="//biblehub.com/haggai/2-1.htm">Haggai 2:1-9</a>). Just as Haggai encouraged the chiefs and the people of Judah to continue vigorously the building that had been commenced by this announcement of salvation, so Zechariah opens his prophetic labours with the admonition to turn with sincerity to the Lord, and with the warning not to bring the same punishment upon themselves by falling back into the sins of the fathers. This exhortation to repentance, although it was communicated to the prophet in the form of a special revelation from God, is actually only the introduction to the prophecies which follow, requiring thorough repentance as the condition of obtaining the desired salvation, and at the same time setting before the impenitent and ungodly still further heavy judgments.<p>(Note: "The prophet is thus instructed by God, that, before exhibiting to the nation the rich blessings of God for them to look at under the form of symbolical images, he is to declare the duty of His people, or the condition upon which it will be becoming in God to grant them an abundant supply of these good things." - Vitringa, Comm. in Sach. p. 76.)<p><a href="/zechariah/1-1.htm">Zechariah 1:1</a>. Bacho&#772;desh hasshem&#305;&#772;n&#305;&#772; does not mean "on the eighth new moon" (Kimchi, Chr. B. Mich., Koehl.); for cho&#772;desh is never used in chronological notices for the new moon, or the first new moon's day (see at <a href="/exodus/19-1.htm">Exodus 19:1</a>). The day of the eighth month is left indefinite, because this was of no importance whatever to the contents of this particular address. The word of the Lord was as follows: <a href="/zechariah/1-2.htm">Zechariah 1:2</a>. "Jehovah was angry with wrath concerning your fathers. <a href="/zechariah/1-3.htm">Zechariah 1:3</a>. And thou shalt say to them, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, Return ye to me, is the saying of Jehovah of hosts, so will I return to you, saith Jehovah of hosts. <a href="/zechariah/1-4.htm">Zechariah 1:4</a>. Be not like your fathers, to whom the former prophets cried, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, Turn now from your evil ways, and from your evil actions! But they hearkened not, and paid no attention to me, is the saying of Jehovah." The statement in <a href="/zechariah/1-2.htm">Zechariah 1:2</a> contains the ground for the summons to turn, which the prophet is to address to the people, and is therefore placed before &#1493;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468; in <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/1-3.htm">Zechariah 1:3</a>, by which this summons is introduced. Because the Lord was very angry concerning the fathers, those who are living now are to repent with sincerity of heart. The noun qetseph is added as the object to the verb, to give it greater force. The nation had experienced the severe anger of God at the destruction of the kingdom of Judah, and of Jerusalem and the temple, and also in exile. The statement in <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/1-15.htm">Zechariah 1:15</a>, that Jehovah was angry &#1502;&#1506;&#1496;, is not at variance with this; for &#1502;&#1506;&#1496; does not refer to the strength of the anger, but to its duration. &#1493;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468; is the perf. with Vav consec., and is used for the imperative, because the summons to repentance follows as a necessary consequence from the fact stated in <a href="/zechariah/1-2.htm">Zechariah 1:2</a> (cf. Ewald, 342, b and c). &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1501; does not refer to the fathers, which might appear to be grammatically the simplest interpretation, but to the contemporaries of the prophet, addressed in the pronoun your fathers, the existing generation of Judah. &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468; &#1488;&#1500;&#1497; does not presuppose that the people had just fallen away from the Lord again, or had lost all their pleasure in the continuance of the work of building the temple, but simply that the return to the Lord was not a perfect one, not a thorough conversion of heart. So had Jehovah also turned to the people again, and had not only put an end to the sufferings of exile, but had also promised His aid to those who had returned (compare &#1488;&#1504;&#1497; &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1499;&#1501; in <a href="/haggai/1-13.htm">Haggai 1:13</a>); but the more earnestly and the more thoroughly the people turned to Him, the more faithfully and the more gloriously would He bestow upon them His grace and the promised salvation. This admonition is shown to be extremely important by the threefold "saith the Lord of Zebaoth," and strengthened still further in <a href="/zechariah/1-4.htm">Zechariah 1:4</a> by the negative turn not to do like the fathers, who cast the admonitions of the prophets to the winds. The "earlier prophets" are those before the captivity (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/7-7.htm">Zechariah 7:7</a>, <a href="/zechariah/7-12.htm">Zechariah 7:12</a>). The predicate &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; points to the fact that there was a gap between Zechariah and his predecessors, namely the period of the exile, so that Daniel and Ezekiel, who lived in exile, are overlooked; the former because his prophecies are not admonitions addressed to the people, the latter because the greater part of his ministry fell in the very commencement of the exile. Moreover, when alluding to the admonitions of the earlier prophets, Zechariah has not only such utterances in his mind as those in which the prophets summoned the people to repentance with the words &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; (e.g., <a href="/joel/2-13.htm">Joel 2:13</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/14-2.htm">Hosea 14:2-3</a>; <a href="/isaiah/31-6.htm">Isaiah 31:6</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/3-12.htm">Jeremiah 3:12</a>., <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/7-13.htm">Zechariah 7:13</a>, etc.), but the admonitions, threatenings, and reproofs of the earlier prophets generally (compare <a href="/2_kings/17-13.htm">2 Kings 17:13</a>.). The chethib &#1502;&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501; is to be read &#1502;&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501;, a plural form &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; from &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492;, and is to be retained, since the preposition min is wanting in the keri; and this reading has probably only arisen from the offence taken at the use of the plural form &#8219;a&#774;l&#305;&#772;l&#305;&#772;m, which does not occur elsewhere, in the place of &#8219;a&#774;l&#305;&#772;lo&#772;th, although there are many analogies to such a formation, and feminine forms frequently have plurals in &#1470;&#1497;&#1501;, either instead of those in &#1470;&#1493;&#1514; or in addition to them. </body></html>
