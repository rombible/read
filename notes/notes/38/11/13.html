Those have their minds wofully blinded, who do ill, and justify themselves in it; but God will not hold those guiltless who hold themselves so. How can we go to God to beg a blessing on unlawful methods of getting wealth, or to return thanks for success in them? There was a general decay of religion among them, and they regarded it not. The Good Shepherd would feed his flock, but his attention would chiefly be directed to the poor. As an emblem, the prophet seems to have taken two staves; Beauty, denoted the privileges of the Jewish nation, in their national covenant; the other he called Bands, denoting the harmony which hitherto united them as the flock of God. But they chose to cleave to false teachers. The carnal mind and the friendship of the world are enmity to God; and God hates all the workers of iniquity: it is easy to foresee what this will end in. The prophet demanded wages, or a reward, and received thirty pieces of silver. By Divine direction he cast it to the potter, as in disdain for the smallness of the sum. This shadowed forth the bargain of Judas to betray Christ, and the final method of applying it. Nothing ruins a people so certainly, as weakening the brotherhood among them. This follows the dissolving of the covenant between God and them: when sin abounds, love waxes cold, and civil contests follow. No wonder if those fall out among themselves, who have provoked God to fall out with them. Wilful contempt of Christ is the great cause of men's ruin. And if professors rightly valued Christ, they would not contend about little matters.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/zechariah/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the Lord said unto me, Cast it - As a thing vile and rejected, as torn flesh was to be cast to dogs <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/22-31.htm">Exodus 22:31</a>, or a corpse was cast unburied <a href="/isaiah/14-19.htm">Isaiah 14:19</a>; <a href="/isaiah/34-3.htm">Isaiah 34:3</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/14-16.htm">Jeremiah 14:16</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/22-19.htm">Jeremiah 22:19</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/26-23.htm">Jeremiah 26:23</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-30.htm">Jeremiah 36:30</a>, or the dead body of Absalom was cast into the pit <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-17.htm">2 Samuel 18:17</a>, or the dust of the idolaltars into the brook Kedron by Josiah <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/23-12.htm">2 Kings 23:12</a>, or the idols to the moles and the bats (<a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/2-20.htm">Isaiah 2:20</a>, add <a href="/ezekiel/20-8.htm">Ezekiel 20:8</a>); or Judah and Israel from the face of God <a href="/2_kings/13-23.htm">2 Kings 13:23</a>; <a href="/2_kings/17-20.htm">2 Kings 17:20</a>; <a href="/2_kings/24-21.htm">2 Kings 24:21</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/52-3.htm">Jeremiah 52:3</a> into a strange land (<a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-27.htm">Deuteronomy 29:27</a>, (28 English); Coniah and his seed, a vessel in which is no pleasure, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-28.htm">Jeremiah 22:28</a>, into a land which they knew not; or the rebels against God, said, "let us cast away their cards from us" <a href="/psalms/2-3.htm">Psalm 2:3</a>; or wickedness was cast into the Ephah <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/5-1.htm">Zechariah 5:1-11</a> :18; once it is added, "for loathing" <a href="/ezekiel/16-5.htm">Ezekiel 16:5</a>.<p>Unto the potter - The words exactly correspond with the event, that the "thirty pieces of silver" were "cast" or flung away o; that their ultimate destination was the potter, whose field was bought with them; but that they were not cast directly to him, (which were a contemptuous act, such as would not be used whether for a gift or a purchase), but were cast to him "in the house of the Lord." They were "flung away" by the remorse of Judas, and, in God's Providence, came to the potter. Whether any portion of this was a direct symbolic action of the prophet, or whether it was a prophetic vision, in which Zechariah himself was an actor, and saw himself in the character which he described, doing what he relates, cannot now be said certainly, since God has not told us. It seems to me more probable, that these actions belonged to the vision, because in other symbolic actions of the prophets, no other actors take part; and it is to the last degree unlikely, that Zechariah, at whose preaching. Zerubbabel and Joshua and all the people set themselves earnestly to rebuild the temple, should have had so worthless a price offered to him; and the casting a price, which God condemned, into the house of God, at the command of God, and so implying His acceptance of it, were inconsistent. It was fulfilled, in act consistently, in Judas' remorse; in that he "flung away the pieces of silver," which had stained his soul with innocent blood, "in the temple," perhaps remembering the words of Zechariah; perhaps wishing to give to pious uses, too late, money which was the price of his soul; whereas God, even through the chief priests, rejected it, and so it came to the potter, its ultimate destination in the Providence of God. Osorius: "He saith, "cast it unto the potter," that they might understand that they would be broken as a potter's vessel."<p>A goodly price, that I was prized at of them - Literally, "the magnificence of the value, at which I was valued of them!" The strong irony is carried on by the, "at which I was valued of them," as in the idiom, "thou wert precious in my sight" <a href="/1_samuel/26-21.htm">1 Samuel 26:21</a>; <a href="/psalms/72-14.htm">Psalm 72:14</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/1-13.htm">2 Kings 1:13-14</a>; <a href="/isaiah/43-4.htm">Isaiah 43:4</a>.

And yet He, who was so valued, was Almighty God. For so it stands: "Thus saith the Lord God, Cast it unto the potter, the goodly price that I was prized at of them." The name, "the potter," connects the prophecy with that former prophecy of Jeremiah Jer 19:1-15, denouncing the judgment of God for the shedding of innocent blood, whereby they had defiled "the valley of the son of Hinnom, which was at the entry of the gate of the pottery, o, and which, through the vengeance of God there, should be called "the valley of slaughter" <a href="/jeremiah/19-6.htm">Jeremiah 19:6</a>.<p>The price of this innocent Blood, by the shedding of which the iniquities of their fathers were filled up, should rest on that same place, for whose sake God said, "I will break this people and this city, as one breaketh a potter's vessel, that cannot be made whole again" <a href="/jeremiah/19-11.htm">Jeremiah 19:11</a>. So then Matthew may have quoted this prophecy as Jeremiah's, to signify how the woes, denounced on the sins committed in this same place, should be brought upon it through this last crowning sin, and "all the righteous blood which had been shed, should come upon that generation" o<p>None of the other cases of mixed quotation come up to this. Mark quotes two prophecies, of Malachi and of Isaiah as Isaiah's <a href="//biblehub.com/mark/1-2.htm">Mark 1:2-3</a>. Matthew blends in one, words of Isaiah Isa 62:1 and Zechariah Zechariah 9:9 as "the prophet" <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/21-4.htm">Matthew 21:4-5</a>. Our Lord unites <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/56-7.htm">Isaiah 56:7</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-11.htm">Jeremiah 7:11</a>, with the words," It is written."<p>Of earlier fathers "Tertullian" simply quotes the prophecy as Jeremiah's (adv. Marc. iv. 40). "Origen" says, "Jeremiah is not said to have prophesied this anywhere in his books, either what are read in the Churches, or reported (referuntur) among the Jews. I suspect that it is an error of writing, or that it is some secret writing of Jeremiah wherein it is written." (in Matt. p. 916.) "Euscbius" says, "Consider since this, is not in the prophet Jeremiah, whether we must think that it was removed from it by some wickedness, or whether it was a clericai error of those who made the copies of the Gospels carelessly." Dem. Ev. x. p. 481). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/zechariah/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. Cast it unto the potter&#8212;proverbial: Throw it to the temple potter, the most suitable person to whom to cast the despicable sum, plying his trade as he did in the polluted valley (2Ki 23:10) of Hinnom, because it furnished him with the most suitable clay. This same valley, and the potter's shop, were made the scene of symbolic actions by Jeremiah (Jer 18:1-19:15) when prophesying of this very period of Jewish history. Zechariah connects his prophecy here with the older one of Jeremiah: showing the further application of the same divine threat against his unfaithful people in their destruction under Rome, as before in that under Nebuchadnezzar. Hence Mt 27:9, in English Version, and in the oldest authorities, quotes Zechariah's words as Jeremiah's, the latter being the original author from whom Zechariah derived the groundwork of the prophecy. Compare the parallel case of Mr 1:2, 3 in the oldest manuscripts (though not in English Version), quoting Malachi's words as those of "Isaiah," the original source of the prophecy. Compare my [1189]Introduction to Zechariah. The "potter" is significant of God's absolute power over the clay framed by His own hands (Isa 45:9; Jer 18:6; Ro 9:20, 21).<p>in the house of the Lord&#8212;The thirty pieces are thrown down in the temple, as the house of Jehovah, the fit place for the money of Jehovah-Messiah being deposited, in the treasury, and the very place accordingly where Judas "cast them down." The thirty pieces were cast "to the potter," because it was to him they were "appointed by the Lord" ultimately to go, as a worthless price (compare Mt 27:6, 7, 10). For "I took," "I threw," here Matthew has "they took," "they gave them"; because their (the Jews' and Judas') act was all His "appointment" (which Matthew also expresses), and therefore is here attributed to Him (compare Ac 2:23; 4:28). It is curious that some old translators translate, for "to the potter," "to the treasury" (so Maurer), agreeing with Mt 27:6. But English Version agrees better with Hebrew and Mt 27:10.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/zechariah/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The Lord, </span> God the Father, with detestation of so vile an affront and undervalue of his Son, said unto me; to Zechariah, in this theatre personating Christ sometimes. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Cast it unto the potter; </span> as being so little it would hardly purchase any thing but what was cheapest among them, a little earthenware. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">A goodly price that I was prized at of them:</span> in an irony God upbraids the shepherds of his people, who prized the great Shepherd no higher. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I took; </span> Zechariah, who in this part now emblematically doth what Judas will with horror do when he hath sold innocent blood and betrayed it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Cast them to the potter in the house of the Lord; </span> or rather, east them into the house of the Lord for the potter, all which the Jewish rulers act over in their prosecuting Christ unto death. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/zechariah/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the Lord said unto me,.... The Prophet Zechariah, in a visionary way representing the sanhedrim of the Jews, the chief priests, scribes, and elders: <p>Cast it unto the potter; for the purchase of his field, in order to make a burying ground of it for strangers: <p>a goodly price that I was prised at of them; this is sarcastically said; meaning that it was a very poor price; and showed that they had no notion of the worth and value of Christ, the Pearl of great price: <p>and I took the thirty pieces of silver, and cast them to the potter in the house of the Lord; it is a question with some what these pieces of silver were; they are commonly understood of silver shekels. So the Targum, in <a href="/genesis/20-16.htm">Genesis 20:16</a> renders pieces of silver by shekels of silver; and Eusebius (m) calls these here thirty staters, the same with shekels; which, if common shekels, reckoned at one shilling and three pence, made but thirty seven shillings and sixpence; and if shekels of the sanctuary, which at most were but two shillings and sixpence, thirty of these would make but three pounds fifteen shillings; and therefore may be truly called, ironically speaking, "a goodly price"; being no more than the price of a servant, as before observed: but Drusius objects to this, seeing a potter's field was bought with this money; and asks, who can believe that a field near so populous a city as Jerusalem could be bought for thirty shekels? and observes, from R. Elias Levita (n), that it is a rule with their doctors, that all silver mentioned in the law signifies shekels; in the prophets, pounds; and in the Hagiographa, talents: this is said, but not proved: to understand these of pounds, indeed, would make the price considerable, and sufficient for the purchase of a large field; for a silver maneh or pound with the Jews was of the value of sixty shekels, <a href="/ezekiel/45-12.htm">Ezekiel 45:12</a> and thirty of these make two hundred and seventy pounds; but then this would not in an ironical way be called "a goodly price": and as to the objection about the purchase of a field with such a sum of money as thirty shekels amount to, it may be observed, what Grotius seems rightly to conjecture, that this was a field the potter had dug up, and had made the most of it, and so was good for nothing but for such an use, for which it was bought, to bury strangers in. It is also a difficulty to fix it certainly to whom this money was ordered to be given, and was given. It is here said "to the potter"; but Jarchi and Kimchi observe, that some of their interpreters render it the "treasurer"; and being sometimes changed for one another; thus, the Targum paraphrases it, <p>"under the hand of the treasurer;'' <p>and so others (o); and indeed the money was given to the chief priests and elders, some of whom might be in that office, <a href="/matthew/27-3.htm">Matthew 27:3</a> though there is no need of such an alteration of the word, since the money Judas took for betraying Christ, and cast into the temple to the priests, they took up, and gave it to the potter for the field they bought of him with it; and, in the evangelist, the phrase by way of explanation is rendered, "for the potter's field", and may be here properly enough translated, "for the potter"; as the particle is sometimes used (p); that is, to be given to him for purchase money (q): and whereas the money is said to be cast, or given to him, "in the house of the Lord", i.e. in the temple, it appears a fact, in the accomplishment of this prophecy, that it was cast into the temple, <a href="/matthew/27-5.htm">Matthew 27:5</a> and was took up by the priests; who, in all probability, sent for the potter thither, and agreed with him for his field, and paid him his money there; for there is no reason to believe that he had a workhouse for his business in the temple; though it may be he had one near it; see <a href="/jeremiah/18-1.htm">Jeremiah 18:1</a> and worked for the service of it, since earthen vessels were used in temple service (r).

This explanation, which seems to be the simplest and most satisfactory, of this confessedly difficult passage, does not necessarily involve the supposition that the potter was in the house of the Lord, when the pieces of silver were cast contemptuously down there. It is enough if, in the vision or symbolical action of Zechariah, they were in some way clearly declared to be for him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Like the earlier prophecy of the King (<a href="/zechariah/9-9.htm" title="Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem: behold, your King comes to you: he is just, and having salvation; lowly, and riding on an ass, and on a colt the foal of an ass.">Zechariah 9:9</a>), this prophecy of the Shepherd is remarkable for its literal fulfilment. The “thirty pieces of silver” were literally the “goodly price” paid for Him, “whom they of the children of Israel did value. “The potter” was literally the recipient of it, as the purchase-money of his exhausted field for an unclean purpose (<a href="/context/matthew/27-5.htm" title="And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself....">Matthew 27:5-10</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/zechariah/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord said unto me.</span> The Lord takes the insult as offered to himself in the person of his representative. <span class="cmt_word">Cast it unto the potter;</span> <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;</span>  <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "Lay them in the foundry, and I will see if it is approved;" Vulgate; <span class="accented">Projice illud ad statuarium</span>; the Syriac and Targum have, "Put it into the treasury" (<a href="/malachi/3-10.htm">Malachi 3:10</a>).

But taking our present text as genuine, commentators usually consider the phrase as a proverbial expression for contemptuous treatment; as the Greeks said, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, as the Germans say, "zum Schinder," "to the knacker," and we, "to the dogs." There is, however, no trace elsewhere of any such proverb, nor do we know how it could have arisen; it likewise does not very well suit the last clause of the verse, "I cast them to the potter in the house of the Lord." If we substitute the supposed analogous expression, "I threw them to the dogs," we see how unseemly would be the proverb in this connection. The rendering of the Jews in old time, adopted recently by Knabenbauer, "Cast them to the Creator," is considered by Dr. Pusey to be unidiomatic, and involves great difficulties. It seems simpler to consider that the command, "cast it to the potter," implies contemptuous rejection of the sum, and at the same time intimates the ultimate destination to which, in the sight of Omniscience, it was directed. The potter is named as the workman who makes the meanest utensils out of the vilest material. That this was ordered and executed in vision is plain; how much the prophet understood we cannot tell. The ambiguous and highly typical order was explained and fulfilled to the letter by the action of Judas Iscariot, as the evangelist testifies (<a href="/matthew/27-5.htm">Matthew 27:5-10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">A</span> (<span class="accented">the</span>) <span class="cmt_word">goodly price</span>, etc. This is ironical, of course. Such was the price at which they estimated the good Shepherd's services. <span class="cmt_word">Cast them to the potter in the house of the Lord.</span> This rejection of the paltry wage took place in the house of the Lord (in the vision), because the insult had been really offered to him, and this was the natural place where oblations would be made; thus the transaction was represented as formal and national. Whether the potter was seen in the temple we know not. The prophet was made to connect him in some way with the business; and we learn from the fulfilment that the potter did in the end receive the money, which was paid for his field applied to an unclean purpose. In <a href="/matthew/27-9.htm">Matthew 27:9</a> the two verses, 12, 13, with some variations, are quoted as "spoken by Jeremy the prophet." Hence some attribute this part of Zechariah to Jeremiah; and others think that in St. Matthew the present name is a mistake. The probability is that the evangelist did not name any prophet, but that some early transcriber, remembering the purchase of the field in <a href="/jeremiah/32-6.htm">Jeremiah 32:6-12</a>, attributed the quotation to that prophet. Or we may suppose that inspiration did not extend to all minor details, nor save the writers from unimportant errors. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/zechariah/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div><a href="/zechariah/1-8.htm">Zechariah 1:8</a>. "I saw by night, and behold a man riding upon a red horse, and he stood among the myrtles which were in the hollow; and behind him red, speckled, and white horses. <a href="/zechariah/1-9.htm">Zechariah 1:9</a>. And I said, What are these, my lord? Then the angel that talked with me said to me, I will show thee what these are. <a href="/zechariah/1-10.htm">Zechariah 1:10</a>. And the man who stood among the myrtles answered and said, These are they whom Jehovah hath sent to go through the earth. <a href="/zechariah/1-11.htm">Zechariah 1:11</a>. And they answered the angel of Jehovah who stood among the myrtles, and said, We have gone through the earth, and, behold, the whole earth sits still, and at rest. <a href="/zechariah/1-12.htm">Zechariah 1:12</a>. Then the angel of Jehovah answered and said, Jehovah of hosts, how long wilt Thou not have compassion upon Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, with whom Thou hast been angry these seventy years? <a href="/zechariah/1-13.htm">Zechariah 1:13</a>. And Jehovah answered the angel that talked with me good words, comforting words. <a href="/zechariah/1-14.htm">Zechariah 1:14</a>. And the angel that talked with me said to me, Preach, and say, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, I have been jealous for Jerusalem and Zion with great jealousy, <a href="/zechariah/1-15.htm">Zechariah 1:15</a> and with great wrath I am angry against the nations at rest: for I had been angry for a little, but they helped for harm. <a href="/zechariah/1-16.htm">Zechariah 1:16</a>. Therefore thus saith Jehovah, I turn again to Jerusalem with compassion: my house shall be built in it, is the saying of Jehovah of hosts, and the measuring line shall be drawn over Jerusalem. <a href="/zechariah/1-17.htm">Zechariah 1:17</a>. Preach as yet, and say, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, My cities shall yet swell over with good, and Jehovah will yet comfort Zion, and will yet choose Jerusalem." The prophet sees, during the night of the day described in <a href="/zechariah/1-7.htm">Zechariah 1:7</a> (&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492; is the accusative of duration), in an ecstatic vision, not in a dream but in a waking condition, a rider upon a red horse in a myrtle-bush, stopping in a deep hollow, and behind him a number of riders upon red, speckled, and white horses (su&#772;s&#305;&#772;m are horses with riders, and the reason why the latter are not specially mentioned is that they do not appear during the course of the vision as taking any active part, whilst the colour of their horses is the only significant feature). At the same time he also sees, in direct proximity to himself, an angel who interprets the vision, and farther off (<a href="/zechariah/1-11.htm">Zechariah 1:11</a>) the angel of Jehovah also standing or stopping among the myrtle-bushes, and therefore in front of the man upon a red horse, to whom the riders bring a report, that they have gone through the earth by Jehovah's command and have found the whole earth quiet and at rest; whereupon the angel of Jehovah addresses a prayer to Jehovah for pity upon Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, and receives a good consolatory answer, which the interpreting angel conveys to the prophet, and the latter publicly proclaims in <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/1-14.htm">Zechariah 1:14-17</a>.<p>The rider upon the red horse is not to be identified with the angel of Jehovah, nor the latter with the angelus interpres. It is true that the identity of the rider and the angel of Jehovah, which many commentators assume, is apparently favoured by the circumstance that they are both standing among the myrtles (&#8219;o&#772;me&#772;d, stood; see <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/1-8.htm">Zechariah 1:8</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/1-10.htm">Zechariah 1:10</a>, and <a href="/zechariah/1-11.htm">Zechariah 1:11</a>); but all that follows from this is that the rider stopped at the place where the angel of Jehovah was standing, i.e., in front of him, to present a report to him of the state of the earth, which he had gone through with his retinue. This very circumstance rather favours the diversity of the two, inasmuch as it is evident from this that the rider upon the red horse was simply the front one, or leader of the whole company, who is brought prominently forward as the spokesman and reporter. If the man upon the red horse had been the angel of Jehovah Himself, and the troop of horsemen had merely come to bring information to the man upon the red horse, the troop of horsemen could not have stood behind him, but would have stood either opposite to him or in front of him. And the different epithets applied to the two furnish a decisive proof that the angel of the Lord and "the angel that talked with me" are not one and the same. The angel, who gives or conveys to the prophet the interpretation of the vision, is constantly called "the angel that talked with me," not only in <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/1-9.htm">Zechariah 1:9</a>, where it is preceded by an address on the part of the prophet to this same angel, but also in <a href="/zechariah/1-13.htm">Zechariah 1:13</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/1-14.htm">Zechariah 1:14</a>, and in the visions which follow (<a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/2-2.htm">Zechariah 2:2</a>, <a href="/zechariah/2-7.htm">Zechariah 2:7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/4-1.htm">Zechariah 4:1</a>, <a href="/zechariah/4-4.htm">Zechariah 4:4</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/5-5.htm">Zechariah 5:5</a>, <a href="/zechariah/5-10.htm">Zechariah 5:10</a>; <a href="/zechariah/6-4.htm">Zechariah 6:4</a>), from which it is perfectly obvious that &#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497; denotes the function which this angel performs in these visions (dibber be, signifying the speaking of God or of an angel within a man, as in <a href="/hosea/1-2.htm">Hosea 1:2</a>; <a href="/habakkuk/2-1.htm">Habakkuk 2:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/12-6.htm">Numbers 12:6</a>, <a href="/numbers/12-8.htm">Numbers 12:8</a>). His occupation, therefore, was to interpret the visions to the prophet, and convey the divine revelations, so that he was only an angelus interpres or collocutor. This angel appears in the other visions in company with other angels, and receives instructions from them (<a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/2-5.htm">Zechariah 2:5-8</a>); and his whole activity is restricted to the duty of conveying higher instructions to the prophet, and giving him an insight into the meaning of the visions, whereas the angel of Jehovah stands on an equality with God, being sometimes identified with Jehovah, and at other times distinguished from Him. (Compare the remarks upon this subject in the comm. on Genesis, Pent. pp. 118ff.) In the face of these facts, it is impossible to establish the identity of the two by the arguments that have been adduced in support of it. It by no means follows from <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/1-9.htm">Zechariah 1:9</a>, where the prophet addresses the mediator as "my lord," that the words are addressed to the angel of the Lord; for neither he nor the angelus interpres has been mentioned before; and in the visions persons are frequently introduced as speaking, according to their dramatic character, without having been mentioned before, so that it is only from what they say or do that it is possible to discover who they are. Again, the circumstance that in <a href="/zechariah/1-12.htm">Zechariah 1:12</a> the angel of the Lord presents a petition to the Supreme God on behalf of the covenant nation, and that according to <a href="/zechariah/1-13.htm">Zechariah 1:13</a> Jehovah answers the angelus interpres in good, comforting words, does not prove that he who receives the answer must be the same person as the intercessor: for it might be stated in reply to this, as it has been by Vitringa, that Zechariah has simply omitted to mention that the answer was first of all addressed to the angel of the Lord, and that it was through him that it reached the mediating angel; or we might assume, as Hengstenberg has done, that "Jehovah addressed the answer directly to the mediating angel, because the angel of the Lord had asked the question, not for his own sake, but simply for the purpose of conveying consolation and hope through the mediator to the prophet, and through him to the nation generally."<p>There is no doubt that, in this vision, both the locality in which the rider upon the red horse, with his troop, and the angel of the Lord had taken up their position, and also the colour of the horses, are significant. But they are neither of them easy to interpret. Even the meaning of metsulla&#770;h is questionable. Some explain it as signifying a "shady place," from &#1510;&#1500;, a shadow; but in that case we should expect the form metsilla&#770;h. There is more authority for the assumption that metsulla&#770;h is only another form for metsu&#772;la&#770;h, which is the reading in many codd., and which ordinarily stands for the depth of the sea, just as in <a href="/exodus/15-10.htm">Exodus 15:10</a> tsa&#770;lal signifies to sink into the deep. The Vulgate adopts this rendering: in profundo. Here it signifies, in all probability, a deep hollow, possibly with water in it, as myrtles flourish particularly well in damp soils and by the side of rivers (see Virgil, Georg. ii. 112, iv. 124). The article in bammetsulla&#770;h defines the hollow as the one which the prophet saw in the vision, not the ravine of the fountain of Siloah, as Hofmann supposes (Weissagung u. Erfllung, i. p. 333). The hollow here is not a symbol of the power of the world, or the abyss-like power of the kingdoms of the world (Hengstenberg and M. Baumgarten), as the author of the Chaldee paraphrase in Babele evidently thought; for this cannot be proved from such passages as <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/10-1.htm">Zechariah 10:1-1215:59</a>Isa <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/44-27.htm">Zechariah 44:27</a>, and <a href="/psalms/107-24.htm">Psalm 107:24</a>. In the myrtle-bushes, or myrtle grove, we have no doubt a symbol of the theocracy, or of the land of Judah as a land that was dear and lovely in the estimation of the Lord (cf. <a href="/daniel/8-9.htm">Daniel 8:9</a>; <a href="/daniel/11-16.htm">Daniel 11:16</a>), for the myrtle is a lovely ornamental plant. Hence the hollow in which the myrtle grove was situated, can only be a figurative representation of the deep degradation into which the land and people of God had fallen at that time. There is a great diversity of opinion as to the significance of the colour of the horses, although all the commentators agree that the colour is significant, as in <a href="/zechariah/6-2.htm">Zechariah 6:2</a>. and <a href="/revelation/6-2.htm">Revelation 6:2</a>., and that this is the only reason why the horses are described according to their colours, and the riders are not mentioned at all. About two of the colours there is no dispute. &#1488;&#1491;&#1493;&#1501;, red, the colour of the blood; and &#1500;&#1489;&#1503;, white, brilliant white, the reflection of heavenly and divine glory (<a href="/matthew/17-2.htm">Matthew 17:2</a>; <a href="/matthew/28-3.htm">Matthew 28:3</a>; <a href="/acts/1-10.htm">Acts 1:10</a>), hence the symbol of a glorious victory (<a href="/revelation/6-2.htm">Revelation 6:2</a>). The meaning of seruqq&#305;&#772;m is a disputed one. The lxx have rendered it &#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;, like &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1502;&#1510;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="/zechariah/6-3.htm">Zechariah 6:3</a>; the Itala and Vulgate, varii; the Peshito, versicolores. Hence su&#772;s&#305;&#772;m seruqq&#305;&#772;m would correspond to the &#x3b9;&#788;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c7;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; of <a href="/revelation/6-8.htm">Revelation 6:8</a>. The word seruqq&#305;&#772;m only occurs again in the Old Testament in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/16-8.htm">Isaiah 16:8</a>, where it is applied to the tendrils or branches of the vine, for which so&#772;re&#772;q (<a href="/isaiah/5-2.htm">Isaiah 5:2</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/2-21.htm">Jeremiah 2:21</a>) or sere&#772;qa&#770;h (<a href="/genesis/49-11.htm">Genesis 49:11</a>) is used elsewhere. On the other hand, Gesenius (Thes. s.v.) and others defend the meaning red, after the Arabic as&#780;qaru, the red horse, the fox, from s&#780;aqira, to be bright red; and Koehler understands by su&#772;s&#305;&#772;m seruqq&#305;&#772;m, bright red, fire-coloured, or bay horses. But this meaning cannot be shown to be in accordance with Hebrew usage: for it is a groundless conjecture that the vine branch is called so&#772;re&#772;q from the dark-red grapes (Hitzig on <a href="/isaiah/5-2.htm">Isaiah 5:2</a>); and the incorrectness of it is evident from the fact, that even the Arabic s&#780;aqira does not denote dark-red, but bright, fiery red. The Arabic translator has therefore rendered the Greek &#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#788;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; by Arab. as&#780;qaru in Sol 5:9; but &#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#788;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; answers to the Hebrew &#1488;&#1491;&#1493;&#1501;, and the lxx have expressed su&#772;s&#305;&#772;m 'a&#774;dumm&#305;&#772;m by &#x3b9;&#788;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; &#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#788;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769; both here and in <a href="/zechariah/6-2.htm">Zechariah 6:2</a>. If we compare this with ch. <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/6-2.htm">Zechariah 6:2</a>, where the chariots are drawn by red ('a&#774;dumm&#305;&#772;m, &#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#788;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;), black (shecho&#772;r&#305;&#772;m, &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;), white (lebha&#770;n&#305;&#772;m, &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;), and speckled (berudd&#305;&#772;m, &#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;) horses, and with <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/6.htm">Revelation 6</a>, where the first rider has a white horse (&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;), the second a red one (&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#788;&#x3c1;&#788;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;), the third a black one (&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;), the fourth a pale horse (&#x3c7;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;), there can be no further doubt that three of the colours of the horses mentioned here occur again in the two passages quoted, and that the black horse is simply added as a fourth; so that the seruqq&#305;&#772;m correspond to the berudd&#305;&#772;m of <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/6-3.htm">Zechariah 6:3</a>, and the &#x3b9;&#788;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c7;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; of <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/6-8.htm">Revelation 6:8</a>, and consequently sa&#770;ro&#772;q denotes that starling kind of grey in which the black ground is mixed with white, so that it is not essentially different from ba&#770;ro&#772;d, speckled, or black covered with white spots (<a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/31-10.htm">Genesis 31:10</a>, <a href="/genesis/31-12.htm">Genesis 31:12</a>).<p>By comparing these passages with one another, we obtain so much as certain with regard to the meaning of the different colours, - namely, that the colours neither denote the lands and nations to which the riders had been sent, as Hvernick, Maurer, Hitzig, Ewald, and others suppose; nor the three imperial kingdoms, as Jerome, Cyril, and others have attempted to prove. For, apart from the fact that there is no foundation whatever for the combination proposed, of the red colour with the south as the place of light, or of the white with the west, the fourth quarter of the heavens would be altogether wanting. Moreover, the riders mentioned here have unquestionably gone through the earth in company, according to <a href="/zechariah/1-8.htm">Zechariah 1:8</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/1-11.htm">Zechariah 1:11</a>, or at any rate there is no intimation whatever of their having gone through the different countries separately, according to the colour of their respective horses; and, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/6-6.htm">Zechariah 6:6</a>, not only the chariot with the black horses, but that with the white horses also, goes into the land of the south. Consequently the colour of the horses can only be connected with the mission which the riders had to perform. This is confirmed by <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/6.htm">Revelation 6</a>, inasmuch as a great sword is there given to the rider upon the red horse, to take away peace from the earth, that they may kill one another, and a crown to the rider upon the white horse, who goes forth conquering and to conquer (<a href="/revelation/6-2.htm">Revelation 6:2</a>), whilst the one upon the pale horse receives the name of Death, and has power given to him to slay the fourth part of the earth with sword, famine, and pestilence (<a href="/revelation/6-8.htm">Revelation 6:8</a>). It is true that no such effects as these are attributed to the riders in the vision before us, but this constitutes no essential difference. To the prophet's question, ma&#770;h-'e&#772;lleh, what are these? i.e., what do they mean? the angelus interpres, whom he addresses as "my lord" ('a&#774;do&#772;n&#305;&#772;), answers, "I will show thee what these be;" whereupon the man upon the red horse, as the leader of the company, gives this reply: "These are they whom Jehovah hath sent to go through the earth;" and then proceeds to give the angel of the Lord the report of their mission, viz., "We have been through the earth, and behold all the earth sitteth still and at rest." The man's answer (vayya&#8219;an, <a href="/zechariah/1-10.htm">Zechariah 1:10</a>) is not addressed to the prophet or to the angelus interpres, but to the angel of the Lord mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/1-11.htm">Zechariah 1:11</a>, to whom the former, with his horsemen (hence the plural, "they answered," in <a href="/zechariah/1-11.htm">Zechariah 1:11</a>), had given a report of the result of their mission. The verb &#8219;a&#770;na&#770;h, to answer, refers not to any definite question, but to the request for an explanation contained in the conversation between the prophet and the interpreting angel. &#1495;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, in <a href="/zechariah/1-10.htm">Zechariah 1:10</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/1-11.htm">Zechariah 1:11</a>, is not the land of Judah, or any other land, but the earth. The answer, that the whole earth sits still and at rest (&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1514; &#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1496;&#1514; denotes the peaceful and secure condition of a land and its inhabitants, undisturbed by any foe; cf. <a href="/zechariah/7-7.htm">Zechariah 7:7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-40.htm">1 Chronicles 4:40</a>, and <a href="/judges/18-27.htm">Judges 18:27</a>), points back to <a href="//biblehub.com/haggai/2-7.htm">Haggai 2:7-8</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/haggai/2-22.htm">Haggai 2:22-23</a>. God had there announced that for a little He would shake heaven and earth, the whole world and all nations, that the nations would come and fill His temple with glory. The riders sent out by God now return and report that the earth is by no means shaken and in motion, but the whole world sits quiet and at rest. We must not, indeed, infer from this account that the riders were all sent for the simple and exclusive purpose of obtaining information concerning the state of the earth, and communicating it to the Lord. For it would have been quite superfluous and unmeaning to send out an entire troop, on horses of different colours, for this purpose alone. Their mission was rather to take an active part in the agitation of the nations, if any such existed, and guide it to the divinely appointed end, and that in the manner indicated by the colour of their horses; viz., according to <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/6.htm">Revelation 6</a>, those upon the red horses by war and bloodshed; those upon the starling-grey, or speckled horses, by famine, pestilence, and other plagues; and lastly, those upon the white horses, by victory and the conquest of the world.<p>In the second year of Darius there prevailed universal peace; all the nations of the earlier Chaldaean empire were at rest, and lived in undisturbed prosperity. Only Judaea, the home of the nation of God, was still for the most part lying waste, and Jerusalem was still without walls, and exposed in the most defenceless manner to all the insults of the opponents of the Jews. Such a state of things as this necessarily tended to produce great conflicts in the minds of the more godly men, and to confirm the frivolous in their indifference towards the Lord. As long as the nations of the world enjoyed undisturbed peace, Judah could not expect any essential improvement in its condition. Even though Darius had granted permission for the building of the temple to be continued, the people were still under the bondage of the power of the world, without any prospect of the realization of the glory predicted by the earlier prophets (<a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/31.htm">Jeremiah 31</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/40.htm">Isaiah 40</a>), which was to dawn upon the nation of God when redeemed from Babylon. Hence the angel of the Lord addresses the intercessory prayer to Jehovah in <a href="/zechariah/1-12.htm">Zechariah 1:12</a> : How long wilt Thou not have compassion upon Jerusalem, etc.? For the very fact that the angel of the Lord, through whom Jehovah had formerly led His people and brought them into the promised land and smitten all the enemies before Israel, now appears again, contains in itself one source of consolation. His coming was a sign that Jehovah had not forsaken His people, and His intercession could not fail to remove every doubt as to the fulfilment of the divine promises. The circumstance that the angel of Jehovah addresses an intercessory prayer to Jehovah on behalf of Judah, is no more a disproof of his essential unity with Jehovah, than the intercessory prayer of Christ in <a href="//biblehub.com/john/17.htm">John 17</a> is a disproof of His divinity. The words, "over which Thou hast now been angry for seventy years," do not imply that the seventy years of the Babylonian captivity predicted by Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/25-11.htm">Jeremiah 25:11</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10</a>) were only just drawing to a close. They had already expired in the first year of the reign of Cyrus (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-22.htm">2 Chronicles 36:22</a>; <a href="/ezra/1-1.htm">Ezra 1:1</a>). At the same time, the remark made by Vitringa, Hengstenberg, and others, must not be overlooked, - namely, that these seventy years were completed twice, inasmuch as there were also (not perhaps quite, but nearly) seventy years between the destruction of Jerusalem and of the temple, and the second year of Darius. Now, since the temple was still lying in ruins in the second year of Darius, notwithstanding the command to rebuild it that had been issued by Cyrus (<a href="/haggai/1-4.htm">Haggai 1:4</a>), it might very well appear as though the troubles of the captivity would never come to an end. Under such circumstances, the longing for an end to be put to the mournful condition of Judah could not fail to become greater and greater; and the prayer, "Put an end, O Lord, put an end to all our distress," more importunate than ever.<p>Jehovah replied to the intercession of the angel of the Lord with good and comforting words. Debha&#770;r&#305;&#772;m to&#772;bh&#305;&#772;m are words which promise good, i.e., salvation (cf. <a href="/joshua/23-14.htm">Joshua 23:14</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10</a>). So far as they set before the people the prospect of the mitigation of their distress, they are nichumm&#305;&#772;m, consolations. The word nichumm&#305;&#772;m is a substantive, and in apposition to debha&#770;r&#305;&#772;m. Instead of the form nichumm&#305;&#772;m, the keri has the form nichum&#305;&#772;m, which is grammatically the more correct of the two, and which is written still more accurately nichu&#772;m&#305;&#772;m in some of the codd. in Kennicott. The contents of these words, which are addressed to the interpreting angel either directly or through the medium of the angel of Jehovah, follow in the announcement which the latter orders the prophet to make in <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/1-14.htm">Zechariah 1:14-17</a>. &#1511;&#1512;&#1488; (<a href="/zechariah/1-14.htm">Zechariah 1:14</a>) as in <a href="/isaiah/40-6.htm">Isaiah 40:6</a>. The word of the Lord contains two things: (1) the assurance of energetic love on the part of God towards Jerusalem (<a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/1-14.htm">Zechariah 1:14</a>, <a href="/zechariah/1-15.htm">Zechariah 1:15</a>); and (2) the promise that this love will show itself in the restoration and prosperity of Jerusalem (<a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/1-16.htm">Zechariah 1:16</a>, <a href="/zechariah/1-17.htm">Zechariah 1:17</a>). &#1511;&#1504;&#1468;&#1488;, to be jealous, applied to the jealousy of love as in <a href="/joel/2-18.htm">Joel 2:18</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/25-11.htm">Numbers 25:11</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/25-13.htm">Numbers 25:13</a>, etc., is strengthened by &#1511;&#1504;&#1488;&#1492; &#1490;&#1491;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492;. Observe, too, the use of the perfect &#1511;&#1504;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514;&#1497;, as distinguished from the participle &#1511;&#1510;&#1507;. The perfect is not merely used in the sense of "I have become jealous," expressing the fact that Jehovah was inspired with burning jealousy, to take Jerusalem to Himself (Koehler), but includes the thought that God has already manifested this zeal, or begun to put it in action, namely by liberating His people from exile. Zion, namely the mountain of Zion, is mentioned along with Jerusalem as being the site on which the temple stood, so that Jerusalem only comes into consideration as the capital of the kingdom. Jehovah is also angry with the self-secure and peaceful nations. The participle qo&#772;tse&#772;ph designates the wrath as lasting. Sha'a&#774;na&#770;n, quiet and careless in their confidence in their own power and prosperity, which they regard as secured for ever. The following word, &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, quod, introduces the reason why God is angry, viz., because, whereas He was only a little angry with Israel, they assisted for evil. &#1502;&#1506;&#1496; refers to the duration, not to the greatness of the anger (cf. <a href="/isaiah/54-8.htm">Isaiah 54:8</a>). &#1506;&#1494;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; &#1500;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492;, they helped, so that evil was the result (&#1500;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492; as in <a href="/jeremiah/44-11.htm">Jeremiah 44:11</a>), i.e., they assisted not only as the instruments of God for the chastisement of Judah, but so that harm arose from it, inasmuch as they endeavoured to destroy Israel altogether (cf. <a href="/isaiah/47-6.htm">Isaiah 47:6</a>). It is no ground of objection to this definition of the meaning of the words, that &#1500;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492; in that case does not form an appropriate antithesis to &#1502;&#1506;&#1496;, which relates to time (Koehler); for the fact that the anger only lasted a short time, was in itself a proof that God did not intend to destroy His people. To understand &#1506;&#1494;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; &#1500;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492; as only referring to the prolonged oppression and captivity, does not sufficiently answer to the words. Therefore (la&#770;khe&#772;n, <a href="/zechariah/1-16.htm">Zechariah 1:16</a>), because Jehovah is jealous with love for His people, and very angry with the heathen, He has now turned with compassion towards Jerusalem. The perfect &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; is not purely prophetic, but describes the event as having already commenced, and as still continuing. This compassion will show itself in the fact that the house of God is to be built in Jerusalem, and the city itself restored, and all the obstacles to this are to be cleared out of the way. The measuring line is drawn over a city, to mark off the space it is to occupy, and the plan upon which it is to be arranged. The chethib &#1511;&#1493;&#1492; bihtehc , probably to be read &#1511;&#1493;&#1492;, is the obsolete form, which occurs again in <a href="/1_kings/7-23.htm">1 Kings 7:23</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-39.htm">Jeremiah 31:39</a>, and was displaced by the contracted form &#1511;&#1493; (keri). But the compassion of God will not be restricted to this. The prophet is to proclaim still more ("cry yet," <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/1-17.htm">Zechariah 1:17</a>, referring to the "cry" in <a href="/zechariah/1-14.htm">Zechariah 1:14</a>). The cities of Jehovah, i.e., of the land of the Lord, are still to overflow with good, or with prosperity. Pu&#772;ts, to overflow, as in <a href="/proverbs/5-16.htm">Proverbs 5:16</a>; and &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468;&#1510;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; for &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468;&#1510;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492; (vid., Ewald, 196, c). The last two clauses round off the promise. When the Lord shall restore the temple and city, then will Zion and Jerusalem learn that He is comforting her, and has chosen her still. The last thought is repeated in <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/2-1.htm">Zechariah 2:1-13</a> :16 and <a href="/zechariah/3-2.htm">Zechariah 3:2</a>.<p>In this vision it is shown to the prophet, and through him to the people, that although the immediate condition of things presents no prospect of the fulfilment of the promised restoration and glorification of Israel, the Lord has nevertheless already appointed the instruments of His judgment, and sent them out to overthrow the nations of the world, that are still living at rest and in security, and to perfect His Zion. The fulfilment of this consolatory promise is neither to be transferred to the end of the present course of this world, as is supposed by Hofmann (Weiss. u. Erfll. i. 335), who refers to <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/14-18.htm">Zechariah 14:18-19</a> in support of this, nor to be restricted to what was done in the immediate future for the rebuilding of the temple and of the city of Jerusalem. The promise embraces the whole of the future of the kingdom of God; so that whilst the commencement of the fulfilment is to be seen in the fact that the building of the temple was finished in the sixth year of Darius, and Jerusalem itself was also restored by Nehemiah in the reign of Artaxerxes, these commencements of the fulfilment sim</body></html>
