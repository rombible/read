How can the fir trees stand, if the cedars fall? The falls of the wise and good into sin, and the falls of the rich and great into trouble, are loud alarms to those every way their inferiors. It is sad with a people, when those who should be as shepherds to them, are as young lions. The pride of Jordan was the thickets on the banks; and when the river overflowed the banks, the lions came up from them roaring.

There is one chorus of desolation, the mighty and the lowly; the shepherds and the young lions; what is at other times opposed is joined in one wailing. "The pride of Jordan" are the stately oaks on its banks, which shroud it from sight, until you reach its edges, and which, after the captivity of the ten tribes, became the haunt of lions and their chief abode in Palestine, "on account of the burning heat, and the nearness of the desert, and the breadth of the vast solitude and jungles" (Jerome).

But the literal reference holds good. “The desolating storm sweeps from the highlands to the lowlands. The very shepherds are forced to howl, because their splendour is laid waste, namely, the pasture lands, in which they were wont to tend and feed their flocks in the days of peace and quiet. The conflagration extends even to the south of the land. Judah is wrapped in flames.

The lion is not now found in Palestine, but must have been common in earlier times, especially in such places as the brushwood and reedy coverts which line the margin of the Jordan. The prophet introduces the inanimate and animate creation - trees, men, beasts - alike deploring the calamity. And the terms in which this is depicted point to some great disaster and ruin, and, as it seems, to the final catastrophe of the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans, the punishment of the rejection of Messiah. This reference becomes plainer as we proceed. It is inadmissible to refer the passage (as some do) to the Assyrian invasions mentioned in <a href="/2_kings/15-29.htm">2 Kings 15:29</a> and <a href="/1_chronicles/5-26.htm">1 Chronicles 5:26</a>. Holding the post-exilian origin of the prophecy, we are bound to interpret it in accordance with this view, which, indeed, presents fewer difficulties than the other. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/zechariah/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The first word of the Lord was addressed to the prophet Zechariah in the eighth month of the second year of the reign of Darius, and therefore about two months after Haggai's first prophecy and the commencement of the rebuilding of the temple, which that prophecy was intended to promote (compare <a href="/zechariah/1-1.htm">Zechariah 1:1</a> with <a href="/haggai/1-1.htm">Haggai 1:1</a> and <a href="/haggai/1-15.htm">Haggai 1:15</a>), and a few weeks after Haggai's prophecy of the great glory which the new temple would receive (<a href="//biblehub.com/haggai/2-1.htm">Haggai 2:1-9</a>). Just as Haggai encouraged the chiefs and the people of Judah to continue vigorously the building that had been commenced by this announcement of salvation, so Zechariah opens his prophetic labours with the admonition to turn with sincerity to the Lord, and with the warning not to bring the same punishment upon themselves by falling back into the sins of the fathers. This exhortation to repentance, although it was communicated to the prophet in the form of a special revelation from God, is actually only the introduction to the prophecies which follow, requiring thorough repentance as the condition of obtaining the desired salvation, and at the same time setting before the impenitent and ungodly still further heavy judgments.<p>(Note: "The prophet is thus instructed by God, that, before exhibiting to the nation the rich blessings of God for them to look at under the form of symbolical images, he is to declare the duty of His people, or the condition upon which it will be becoming in God to grant them an abundant supply of these good things." - Vitringa, Comm. in Sach. p. 76.)<p><a href="/zechariah/1-1.htm">Zechariah 1:1</a>. Bacho&#772;desh hasshem&#305;&#772;n&#305;&#772; does not mean "on the eighth new moon" (Kimchi, Chr. B. Mich., Koehl.); for cho&#772;desh is never used in chronological notices for the new moon, or the first new moon's day (see at <a href="/exodus/19-1.htm">Exodus 19:1</a>). The day of the eighth month is left indefinite, because this was of no importance whatever to the contents of this particular address. The word of the Lord was as follows: <a href="/zechariah/1-2.htm">Zechariah 1:2</a>. "Jehovah was angry with wrath concerning your fathers. <a href="/zechariah/1-3.htm">Zechariah 1:3</a>. And thou shalt say to them, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, Return ye to me, is the saying of Jehovah of hosts, so will I return to you, saith Jehovah of hosts. <a href="/zechariah/1-4.htm">Zechariah 1:4</a>. Be not like your fathers, to whom the former prophets cried, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, Turn now from your evil ways, and from your evil actions! But they hearkened not, and paid no attention to me, is the saying of Jehovah." The statement in <a href="/zechariah/1-2.htm">Zechariah 1:2</a> contains the ground for the summons to turn, which the prophet is to address to the people, and is therefore placed before &#1493;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468; in <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/1-3.htm">Zechariah 1:3</a>, by which this summons is introduced. Because the Lord was very angry concerning the fathers, those who are living now are to repent with sincerity of heart. The noun qetseph is added as the object to the verb, to give it greater force. The nation had experienced the severe anger of God at the destruction of the kingdom of Judah, and of Jerusalem and the temple, and also in exile. The statement in <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/1-15.htm">Zechariah 1:15</a>, that Jehovah was angry &#1502;&#1506;&#1496;, is not at variance with this; for &#1502;&#1506;&#1496; does not refer to the strength of the anger, but to its duration. &#1493;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468; is the perf. with Vav consec., and is used for the imperative, because the summons to repentance follows as a necessary consequence from the fact stated in <a href="/zechariah/1-2.htm">Zechariah 1:2</a> (cf. Ewald, 342, b and c). &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1501; does not refer to the fathers, which might appear to be grammatically the simplest interpretation, but to the contemporaries of the prophet, addressed in the pronoun your fathers, the existing generation of Judah. &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468; &#1488;&#1500;&#1497; does not presuppose that the people had just fallen away from the Lord again, or had lost all their pleasure in the continuance of the work of building the temple, but simply that the return to the Lord was not a perfect one, not a thorough conversion of heart. So had Jehovah also turned to the people again, and had not only put an end to the sufferings of exile, but had also promised His aid to those who had returned (compare &#1488;&#1504;&#1497; &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1499;&#1501; in <a href="/haggai/1-13.htm">Haggai 1:13</a>); but the more earnestly and the more thoroughly the people turned to Him, the more faithfully and the more gloriously would He bestow upon them His grace and the promised salvation. This admonition is shown to be extremely important by the threefold "saith the Lord of Zebaoth," and strengthened still further in <a href="/zechariah/1-4.htm">Zechariah 1:4</a> by the negative turn not to do like the fathers, who cast the admonitions of the prophets to the winds. The "earlier prophets" are those before the captivity (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/7-7.htm">Zechariah 7:7</a>, <a href="/zechariah/7-12.htm">Zechariah 7:12</a>). The predicate &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; points to the fact that there was a gap between Zechariah and his predecessors, namely the period of the exile, so that Daniel and Ezekiel, who lived in exile, are overlooked; the former because his prophecies are not admonitions addressed to the people, the latter because the greater part of his ministry fell in the very commencement of the exile. Moreover, when alluding to the admonitions of the earlier prophets, Zechariah has not only such utterances in his mind as those in which the prophets summoned the people to repentance with the words &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; (e.g., <a href="/joel/2-13.htm">Joel 2:13</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/14-2.htm">Hosea 14:2-3</a>; <a href="/isaiah/31-6.htm">Isaiah 31:6</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/3-12.htm">Jeremiah 3:12</a>., <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/7-13.htm">Zechariah 7:13</a>, etc.), but the admonitions, threatenings, and reproofs of the earlier prophets generally (compare <a href="/2_kings/17-13.htm">2 Kings 17:13</a>.). The chethib &#1502;&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501; is to be read &#1502;&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501;, a plural form &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; from &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492;, and is to be retained, since the preposition min is wanting in the keri; and this reading has probably only arisen from the offence taken at the use of the plural form &#8219;a&#774;l&#305;&#772;l&#305;&#772;m, which does not occur elsewhere, in the place of &#8219;a&#774;l&#305;&#772;lo&#772;th, although there are many analogies to such a formation, and feminine forms frequently have plurals in &#1470;&#1497;&#1501;, either instead of those in &#1470;&#1493;&#1514; or in addition to them. </body></html>
