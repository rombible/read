This command seems to be addressed to Zechariah; but an insuperable objection lies against its being understood as given to him in his own person, because he did not live in such times as are here described; for Zerubbabel the governor, and Joshua the high-priest, it appears, were men of extraordinary piety and virtue; and no doubt the rest of the princes or rulers of the people at this time were good men. We can, therefore, understand it in no other manner, as addressed to Zechariah, than as he typified Christ; and so God commanded him to do that which he had appointed Christ to do, namely, to gather and feed the lost sheep of Israel, which their shepherds scattered and destroyed. <span class="ital">Whose possessors slay them — </span>Whose governors and teachers are the cause of their destruction.

In Christ’s time, which seems to be here referred to, “the chief priests and the elders, who were the possessors of the flock, by their traditions, the commandments of men, and their impositions on the consciences of the people, were become perfect tyrants, devouring their houses, engrossing their wealth, and fleecing the flock instead of feeding it. The Sadducees, who were Deists, corrupted their judgments; the Pharisees, who were bigots for superstitious observances, corrupted their morals by making void the commandments of God, <a href="/matthew/15-6.htm" title="And honor not his father or his mother, he shall be free.

Those have their minds wofully blinded, who do ill, and justify themselves in it; but God will not hold those guiltless who hold themselves so. How can we go to God to beg a blessing on unlawful methods of getting wealth, or to return thanks for success in them? There was a general decay of religion among them, and they regarded it not. The Good Shepherd would feed his flock, but his attention would chiefly be directed to the poor. As an emblem, the prophet seems to have taken two staves; Beauty, denoted the privileges of the Jewish nation, in their national covenant; the other he called Bands, denoting the harmony which hitherto united them as the flock of God. But they chose to cleave to false teachers. The carnal mind and the friendship of the world are enmity to God; and God hates all the workers of iniquity: it is easy to foresee what this will end in. The prophet demanded wages, or a reward, and received thirty pieces of silver. By Divine direction he cast it to the potter, as in disdain for the smallness of the sum. This shadowed forth the bargain of Judas to betray Christ, and the final method of applying it. Nothing ruins a people so certainly, as weakening the brotherhood among them. This follows the dissolving of the covenant between God and them: when sin abounds, love waxes cold, and civil contests follow. No wonder if those fall out among themselves, who have provoked God to fall out with them. Wilful contempt of Christ is the great cause of men's ruin. And if professors rightly valued Christ, they would not contend about little matters.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/zechariah/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thus saith the Lord my God, Feed the flock of the slaughter - The fulfillment of the whole prophecy shows, that the person addressed is the prophet, not in, or for himself, but (as belongs to symbolic prophecy) as representing Another, our Lord. It is addressed, in the first instance, to Zechariah. For Zechariah is bidden, "take unto thee yet the instruments of a foolish shepherd" <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/11-15.htm">Zechariah 11:15</a>, in words addressed to himself, personally; "And the Lord said unto me." But he who was to represent the foolish shepherd, had represented the True Shepherd, since it is said to him, "Take unto thee yet." But He, the Shepherd addressed, who does the acts commanded, speaks with the authority of God. He says, "I cut off three shepherds in one month" <a href="/zechariah/11-8.htm">Zechariah 11:8</a>; "I broke My covenant which I had made with all the peoples" <a href="/zechariah/11-10.htm">Zechariah 11:10</a>; "the poor of the flock waited upon Me" <a href="/zechariah/11-11.htm">Zechariah 11:11</a>; "I cut asunder Mine other staff, Bands, that I might break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel" <a href="/zechariah/11-14.htm">Zechariah 11:14</a>. But in Zechariah's time, no three shepherds were cut off, the covenant made by God was not broken on His part, there was no such visible distinction between those who waited on God, and those who, outwardly too, rejected Him.<p>Feed the flock of the slaughter - Those who were, even before the end, slain by their evil shepherds whom they followed, and who in the end would be given to the slaughter, as the Psalmist says, "we are counted as sheep for the slaughter" <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/44-22.htm">Psalm 44:22</a>, because they would not hear the voice of the True Shepherd, and were not His sheep. They were already, by God's judgment, a prey to evil shepherds; and would be so yet more hereafter. As a whole then, they were "sheep of the slaughter." It is a last Charge given to feed them. As our Lord says, "Last of all, He sent unto them His Son, saying, They will reverence My Son" <a href="/matthew/21-37.htm">Matthew 21:37</a>. This failing, nothing remained but that the flock would be given up, as they themselves say, "He will miserably destroy those wicked people, and will let out His vineyard unto other husbandmen, which shall render Him the fruits in their seasons" <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/21-41.htm">Matthew 21:41</a>, that is, our Lord explains it, "The kingdom of heaven shall be taken from them, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof. Yet a remnant should be saved" <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/21-43.htm">Matthew 21:43</a>, for whose sake the larger flock was still to be fed: and, as our Lord, as Man, wept over Jerusalem, whose sentence He pronounced, so He still feeds those who would not turn to Him that they might be saved, and who would in the end be "a flock of slaughter," "Death their shepherd" <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/49-14.htm">Psalm 49:14</a>, since they chose death rather than Life. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/zechariah/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. The prophet here proceeds to show the cause of the destruction just foretold, namely, the rejection of Messiah.<p>flock of &#8230; slaughter&#8212;(Ps 44:22). God's people doomed to slaughter by the Romans. Zechariah here represents typically Messiah, and performs in vision the actions enjoined: hence the language is in part appropriate to him, but mainly to the Antitype, Messiah. A million and a half perished in the Jewish war, and one million one hundred thousand at the fall of Jerusalem. "Feed" implies that the Jews could not plead ignorance of God's will to execute their sin. Zechariah and the other prophets had by God's appointment "fed" them (Ac 20:28) with the word of God, teaching and warning them to escape from coming wrath by repentance: the type of Messiah, the chief Shepherd, who receives the commission of the Father, with whom He is one (Zec 11:4); and Himself says (Zec 11:7), "I will feed the flock of slaughter." Zechariah did not live to "feed" literally the "flock of slaughter"; Messiah alone "fed" those who, because of their rejection of Him, were condemned to slaughter. Jehovah-Messiah is the speaker. It is He who threatens to inflict the punishments (Zec 11:6, 8). The typical breaking of the staff, performed in vision by Zechariah (Zec 11:10), is fulfilled in His breaking the covenant with Judah. It is He who was sold for thirty pieces of silver (Zec 11:12, 13).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/zechariah/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Thus saith the Lord my God; </span> God the Father. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Feed; </span> O Zechariah, feed, comfort, rule: but rather the Father speaks to Christ the Son, and appoints him who is the eternal Shepherd to feed his sheep. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The flock of the slaughter; </span> appointed to the slaughter by different hands, and for different causes.

The passage is dramatic. The prophet is represented as personating, inclusively perhaps, as is so generally the case in O.

Compare, as illustrating the rejection alike of the whole typical order and of the Antitype, St Stephen’s words: “Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and they have slain them which shewed before of the coming of the Just One, of whom ye have been now the betrayers and the murderers.” <a href="/acts/7-52.htm" title="Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and they have slain them which showed before of the coming of the Just One; of whom you have been now the betrayers and murderers:">Acts 7:52</a>. “Hic autem non recitat propheta simpliciter quale mandatum ipse acceperit a Deo: sed in genere docet semper Deum officio boni et fidi pastoris defunctum fuisse erga Judæos.

"Your fathers, where are they? And the prophets, can they live for ever? <a href="/zechariah/1-6.htm">Zechariah 1:6</a>. Nevertheless my words and my statutes, which I commanded my servants the prophets, did they not overtake your fathers, so that they turned and said, As Jehovah purposed to do to us according to our ways and our actions, so has He done to us?" The two questions in <a href="/zechariah/1-5.htm">Zechariah 1:5</a> are meant as denials, and are intended to anticipate the objection which the people might have raised to the admonitions in <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/1-4.htm">Zechariah 1:4</a>, to the effect that not only the fathers, but also the earlier prophets, had died long ago; and therefore an allusion to things that had long since passed by could have no force at all for the present generation. Zechariah neutralizes this objection by saying: Your fathers have indeed been long dead, and even the prophets do not, or cannot, live for ever; but notwithstanding this, the words of the earlier prophets were fulfilled in the case of the fathers. The words and decrees of God uttered by the prophets did reach the fathers, so that they were obliged to confess that God had really done to them what He threatened, i.e., had carried out the threatened punishment. &#1488;&#1498;, only, in the sense of a limitation of the thing stated: yet, nevertheless (cf. Ewald, 105, d). &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497; and &#1495;&#1511;&#1468;&#1497; are not the words of <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/1-4.htm">Zechariah 1:4</a>, which call to repentance, but the threats and judicial decrees which the earlier prophets announced in case of impenitence. &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497; as in <a href="/ezekiel/12-28.htm">Ezekiel 12:28</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/39-16.htm">Jeremiah 39:16</a>. &#1495;&#1511;&#1468;&#1497;, the judicial decrees of God, like cho&#772;q in <a href="/zephaniah/2-2.htm">Zephaniah 2:2</a>.

Biblical proofs that even the fathers themselves did acknowledge that the Lord had fulfilled His threatenings in their experience, are to be found in the mournful psalms written in captivity (though not exactly in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/126-1.htm">Psalm 126:1-6</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/137-1.htm">Psalm 137:1-9</a>, as Koehler supposes), in <a href="/lamentations/2-17.htm">Lamentations 2:17</a> (&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1494;&#1502;&#1501;, upon which Zechariah seems to play), and in the penitential prayers of Daniel (<a href="/daniel/9-4.htm">Daniel 9:4</a>.) and of Ezra (<a href="/ezra/9-6.htm">Ezra 9:6</a>.), so far as they express the feeling which prevailed in the congregation. </body></html>
