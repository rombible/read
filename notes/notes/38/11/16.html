So a succession of priests is represented under the single person of Levi, <a href="/context/malachi/2-5.htm" title="My covenant was with him of life and peace; and I gave them to him for the fear with which he feared me, and was afraid before my name....">Malachi 2:5-6</a>. Since the Jews had rejected the true Shepherd, God threatens to send, or permit to arise, among them, such shepherds to rule or teach them as should be notorious for their negligence and avarice, their cruelty and oppression. This may be understood either of the blind guides of whom Christ speaks, and whose character he describes at large, <a href="/context/matthew/23-13.htm" title="But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for you neither go in yourselves, neither suffer you them that are entering to go in....">Matthew 23:13-33</a>; namely, the scribes and Pharisees, the priests and doctors of their law; or of the avaricious, tyrannical, and unmerciful princes, that should rule them with rigour, and make their own land as much a place of bondage to them as ever Egypt or Babylon had been. And when they had rejected him by whom <span class="ital">princes decree justice, </span>it was just that they should be given over into the power of those who should decree unrighteous decrees. It is probable, also, that there is a reference here to the false prophets and false Christs, which, as our Lord foretold, <a href="/matthew/24-5.htm" title="For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many.">Matthew 24:5</a>, should arise. Many such there were, who, by their seditious practices, provoked the Romans, and hastened on the ruin of the Jewish nation: but it is very remarkable that they were never deceived by a counterfeit Messiah till they had refused and rejected the true Messiah. The prophet proceeds to describe the character of these foolish shepherds, in the following words: 1st, They should be negligent; <span class="ital">which shall not visit those that be cut off — </span>Or, as the LXX. render it, <span class="greekheb">το εκλιμπανον</span>, <span class="ital">that which is missing, </span>or has wandered from the flock; and it may signify that which is ready to perish. <span class="ital">Neither shall seek the young one</span> — Which are most apt to perish through weakness; he alludes to the lambs which, on account of their tender age, are not able to follow the flock. <span class="ital">Nor heal that which is broken — </span>Which has received some hurt, but shall leave it to die of its wounds. <span class="ital">Nor feed that that standeth still — </span>Not able to go forward. Blayney renders the word, <span class="ital">made to stand, </span>or set up again after sickness. “Such,” says he,” it is well known, require much care to nourish and support them, in order to their regaining strength; a care which the foolish shepherd will not bestow upon them.” Or, as the LXX. render it, <span class="greekheb">το ολοκληρον ου μη κατευθυνη</span>, <span class="ital">nor shall direct that which is whole, </span>mentioned in opposition to those that wander, or are diseased. 2d, These shepherds would be luxurious; <span class="ital">he shall eat the flesh of the fat — </span>That is, instead of preserving the best of his flock, in order to increase it, he kills them to indulge his own appetite: or, enriches himself by oppressing, or otherwise taking from those that are persons of property: like that wicked servant that said, <span class="ital">My lord delays his coming, </span>he eats and drinks with the drunken, serving his own belly. 3d, They are tyrannical and cruel to the flock. <span class="ital">And tear their claws </span>[or, as it ought to be rendered, <span class="ital">break their hoofs</span>] <span class="ital">in pieces — </span>This implies the same as when it is said (<a href="/ezekiel/34-4.htm" title="The diseased have you not strengthened, neither have you healed that which was sick, neither have you bound up that which was broken, neither have you brought again that which was driven away, neither have you sought that which was lost; but with force and with cruelty have you ruled them.">Ezekiel 34:4</a>) of such shepherds, <span class="ital">With force and with cruelty have ye ruled them. </span>The unwise shepherd, instead of being tender and gentle with his flock, is supposed to drag them about with his iron crook, or to over-drive them in rough and stony ground, so as to break their hoofs. Or, he imposes burdens and hardships upon them that they are unable to bear. Upon the whole, a sluggish, negligent, covetous, riotous, oppressive, and cruel government, priesthood, or ministry, is here shadowed out by a foolish shepherd.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/zechariah/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:15-17 God, having showed the misery of this people in their being justly left by the Good Shepherd, shows their further misery in being abused by foolish shepherds. The description suits the character Christ gives of the scribes and Pharisees. They never do any thing to support the weak, or comfort the feeble-minded; but seek their own ease, while they are barbarous to the flock. The idol shepherd has the garb and appearance of a shepherd, receives submission, and is supported at much expense; but he leaves the flock to perish through neglect, or leads them to ruin by his example. This suits many in different churches and nations, but the warning had an awful fulfilment in the Jewish teachers. And while such deceive others to their ruin, they will themselves have the deepest condemnation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/zechariah/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I will raise up - God supplies the strength or wisdom which people abuse to sin.

Not in the land of Judea, but in the Roman empire; and so not Herod, nor King Agrippa, as Kimchi; nor Antiochus Epiphanes, as others; nor those wicked priests and princes, who governed after the times of Zechariah; nor the Scribes and Pharisees in Christ's times, though they are often called fools by him, and were truly foolish shepherds; nor even Titus Vespasian, who destroyed the city and temple; nor Bar Cozba, who set up for the Messiah, and was a false one; or any other of that sort. Calmet (s) thinks this designs the Roman emperors, successors of Tiberius, under whom Jesus Christ was crucified. Caligula succeeded Tiberius. Claudius Caligula, and Nero succeeded Claudius: everyone knows (adds he) the characters of those princes, that they were truly foolish shepherds, mad, wicked, and cruel: but rather it intends shepherd, or shepherds, not in a civil, but in an ecclesiastic sense; all such after Christ, who took upon them this office, but did not perform it aright, as heretics, false teachers, with which the first ages abounded; and especially it points at the bishop of Rome, and all under him, when he fell off from the true doctrine and discipline of the Gospel, the man of sin, or antichrist, as Jerom rightly observes; who, though his coming is according to the working of Satan, yet may be said to be raised up by the Lord, because he suffered him to rise; and by his secret providence, and wise ordination in righteous judgment, he came to the height of his power: with him agrees the name of a "shepherd"; he calls himself the vicar of Christ, the chief shepherd and bishop of souls; Peter's successor, who was ordered to feed the sheep and lambs of Christ; and universal pastor, and a single one, that will not admit of any associate. The character of a "foolish" one belongs to him, though he would be thought to be wise; nor is he wanting in wicked craft and cunning, but ignorant of the pastoral office, and how to feed the church of God; and is a wicked or evil shepherd, as the word (t) used is pretty much the same in sound with our English word "evil": he governing the flock, not with and according to the word of God, but according to his own will and laws; for his "instruments" are laws of his own making, an exercise of tyrannical power over kings and princes, unwritten traditions, pardons, indulgences, &amp;c.: <p>which shall not visit those that be cut off; not that cut off themselves, or are cut off by the church; but such that go astray, wander from the fold, and are in danger of being lost;  that are perishing, as Jarchi explains the word; these he looks not after, nor has he any regard to their spiritual and eternal welfare: <p>neither shall seek the young one; the lamb, the tender of the flock; he will not do as the good shepherd does, carry the lambs in his arms, <a href="/isaiah/40-11.htm">Isaiah 40:11</a> or, "that which wanders" (u); that strays from the fold, and out of the pastures, or the right way: <p>nor heal that that is broken; that is of a broken and of a contrite spirit; or whose bones are broken, and consciences wounded, through falls into sin: <p>nor feed that that standeth still; that can not move from its place to get fresh pasture, but is obliged to stay where it is, and needs supply and support there: <p>but he shall eat the flesh of the fat; that is, as the Targum well explains it, <p>"shall spoil the substance of the rich;'' <p>see <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/18-3.htm">Revelation 18:3</a>, <p>and tear their claws in pieces; take all their power and privileges from them; all which well agrees with the pope of Rome. <p>(s) Dictionary, in the word "Shepherds."

For a like picture both of neglect of duty and of cruelty in a shepherd see <a href="/ezekiel/34-4.htm" title="The diseased have you not strengthened, neither have you healed that which was sick, neither have you bound up that which was broken, neither have you brought again that which was driven away, neither have you sought that which was lost; but with force and with cruelty have you ruled them.">Ezekiel 34:4</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/zechariah/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will raise up a shepherd in the land.</span> God explains the reason of the symbolical character which he directed the prophet to assume. He was going to allow the people to be chastised by an instrument whom he would permit to work his will upon them. As this evil shepherd was to arise to punish them for their rejection of  Messiah, he must represent some person or power that existed subsequent to Christ's death. Many consider that he symbolizes the Romans; but these people could not be deemed to exercise pastoral care over the Israelites, nor could their neglect of this (ver. 17) be attributed to them as a sin; nor, again, did their destruction follow upon the overthrow of the Jewish polity (ver. 18). Others see here a prediction of the coming of antichrist; but the character of "shepherd" does not suit his attributes as given elsewhere; at any rate. this cannot be the primary reference of the symbol, though all evil powers that oppose the Church of Christ are in some sense images and anticipations of antichrist. The genuine reference here is to the native chiefs and rulers ("in the land") who arose in the later times of the nation - monsters like Herod, false Christs and false prophets (<a href="/matthew/24-5.htm">Matthew 24:5, 11, 12, 24</a>; <a href="/mark/13-22.htm">Mark 13:22</a>), hirelings who made merchandise of the flock, teachers who came in their own name (<a href="/john/5-43.htm">John 5:43</a>), and deceived the people to their destruction. <span class="cmt_word">Which shall not visit those that be cut off;</span> or, <span class="accented">those that are perishing.</span> This foolish shepherd shall perform none of the offices of a good shepherd; he will not care for and tend those that are in danger of death (<a href="/jeremiah/23-2.htm">Jeremiah 23:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The young one;</span> rather, <span class="accented">those that are scattered</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>: Vulgate, <span class="accented">dispersum</span> (<a href="/matthew/18-12.htm">Matthew 18:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That that is broken.</span> Bruised, or with limb fractured. <span class="cmt_word">Feed that that standeth still;</span> literally, <span class="accented">that standeth</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> is sound and healthy.
