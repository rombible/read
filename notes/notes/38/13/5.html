Even the atoning blood of Christ, united with his sanctifying grace. It has hitherto been closed to the unbelieving nation of Israel; but when the Spirit of grace shall humble and soften their hearts, he will open it to them also. This fountain opened is the pierced side of Christ. We are all as an unclean thing. Behold a fountain opened for us to wash in, and streams flowing to us from that fountain. The blood of Christ, and God's pardoning mercy in that blood, made known in the new covenant, are a fountain always flowing, that never can be emptied. It is opened for all believers, who as the spiritual seed of Christ, are of the house of David, and, as living members of the church, are inhabitants of Jerusalem. Christ, by the power of his grace, takes away the dominion of sin, even of beloved sins. Those who are washed in the fountain opened, as they are justified, so they are sanctified. Souls are brought off from the world and the flesh, those two great idols, that they may cleave to God only. The thorough reformation which will take place on the conversion of Israel to Christ, is here foretold. False prophets shall be convinced of their sin and folly, and return to their proper employments. When convinced that we are gone out of the way of duty, we must show the truth of our repentance by returning to it again. It is well to acknowledge those to be friends, who by severe discipline are instrumental in bringing us to a sight of error; for faithful are the wounds of a friend, Pr 27:6. And it is always well for us to recollect the wounds of our Saviour. Often has he been wounded by professed friends, nay, even by his real disciples, when they act contrary to his word.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/zechariah/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And he shall say - Repudiating his former claims, "I am a husbandman:" for a man hath taught me from my youth." There was no room then for his having been a false prophet, since he had had from his youth one simple unlettered occupation, as Amos said truly of himself; "I was no prophet, neither was I a prophet's son: but I was an herdsman and a gatherer of sycamore fruit" <a href="/amos/7-14.htm">Amos 7:14</a>. The prophet does not approve the lie, any more than our Lord did the injustice of the "unjust steward." Our Lord contrasted the wisdom "in their generation" of a bad man for his ends, with the unwisdom of "the children of light," who took no pains to secure their God. Zechariah pictures vividly, how people would anyhow rid themselves of all suspicion of false prophesying. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/zechariah/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5, 6.

St. Cyril and some modern commentators hold that the false prophet says this in sorrow and repentant, not with any idea of deceiving; and that herein is exhibited a signal instance of the grace of God in the Messanic period, when even such sinners are converted from the error of their ways. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/zechariah/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The prophecy commences thus in <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/2-6.htm">Zechariah 2:6-9</a> : <a href="/zechariah/2-6.htm">Zechariah 2:6</a>. "Ho, ho, flee out of the land of the north, is the saying of Jehovah; for I spread you out as the four winds of heaven, is the saying of Jehovah. <a href="/zechariah/2-7.htm">Zechariah 2:7</a>. Ho, Zion, save thyself, thou that dwellest with the daughter Babel. <a href="/zechariah/2-8.htm">Zechariah 2:8</a>. For thus saith Jehovah of hosts, After glory hath he sent me to the nations that have plundered you; for whoever toucheth you, toucheth the apple of His eye. <a href="/zechariah/2-9.htm">Zechariah 2:9</a>. For, behold, I swing my hand over them, and they become a spoil to those who served them; and ye will see that Jehovah of hosts hath sent me." The summons to flee out of Babylon, in <a href="/zechariah/2-6.htm">Zechariah 2:6</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/2-7.htm">Zechariah 2:7</a>, is addressed to the Israelites, who are all included in the one name Zion in <a href="/zechariah/2-7.htm">Zechariah 2:7</a>; and shows that the address which follows is not a simple continuation of the promise in <a href="/zechariah/2-4.htm">Zechariah 2:4</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/2-5.htm">Zechariah 2:5</a>, but is intended both to explain it, and to assign the reason for it. The summons contains so far a reason for it, that the Israelites are directed to flee out of Babylon, because the judgment is about to burst upon this oppressor of the people of God. The words nu&#772;su&#772;, flee, and himma&#770;let&#305;&#772;, save thyself or escape, both point to the judgment, and in <a href="/zechariah/2-9.htm">Zechariah 2:9</a> the judgment itself is clearly spoken of. the land of the north is Babylon (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/1-14.htm">Jeremiah 1:14</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/6-22.htm">Jeremiah 6:22</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/10-22.htm">Jeremiah 10:22</a>; and for the fact itself, <a href="/isaiah/48-20.htm">Isaiah 48:20</a>). The reason for the exclamation "Flee" is first of all given in the clause, "for like the four winds have I spread you out," not "dispersed you" (Vulg., C. B. Mich., Koehler). For apart from the fact that pe&#772;re&#772;s almost always means to spread out, and has the meaning to disperse at the most in <a href="/psalms/68-15.htm">Psalm 68:15</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-21.htm">Ezekiel 17:21</a>, this meaning is altogether unsuitable here. For if Israel had been scattered like the four winds, it would of necessity have been summoned to return, not only from the north, but from all quarters of the globe (Hitzig, Kliefoth). Moreover, we should then have &#1500;&#1488;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;, into the four winds; and the method suggested by Koehler for reconciling &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506; with his view, viz., by assuming that "like the four winds" is equivalent to "as chaff is pounded and driven away from its place by the four winds," according to which the winds would be mentioned in the place of the chaff, will hardly meet with approval. The explanation is rather that the perfect pe&#772;rast&#305;&#772; is used prophetically to denote the purpose of God, which had already been formed, even if its realization was still in the future. To spread out like the four winds is the same as to spread out just as the four winds spread out to all quarters of the globe. Because God has resolved upon spreading out His people in this manner, they are to flee out of Babel, that they may not suffer the fate of Babel. That this thought lies at the foundation of the motive assigned, is evident from the further reasons assigned for the summons in <a href="/zechariah/2-8.htm">Zechariah 2:8</a> and <a href="/zechariah/2-9.htm">Zechariah 2:9</a>.<p>Zion stands for the inhabitants of Zion, namely the people of God, who are for the time being still yo&#772;shebheth bath Ba&#770;bel, dwelling with the daughter Babel. As Zion does not mean the city or fortress of Jerusalem, but the inhabitants, so the "daughter Babel" is not the city of Babylon or country of Babylonia personified, but the inhabitants of Babel; and &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; is construed with the accusative of the person, as in <a href="/psalms/22-4.htm">Psalm 22:4</a> and <a href="/2_samuel/6-2.htm">2 Samuel 6:2</a>. What Jehovah states in explanation of the twofold call to flee out of Babel, does not commence with <a href="/zechariah/2-9.htm">Zechariah 2:9</a> (Ewald), or with &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1490;&#1506; in <a href="/zechariah/2-8.htm">Zechariah 2:8</a> (Koehler), but with &#1488;&#1495;&#1512; &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;. The incorrectness of the two former explanations is seen first of all in the fact that &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; only introduces a speech in the same manner as &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;, when it follows directly upon the introductory formula; but not, as is here assumed, when a long parenthesis is inserted between, without the introduction being resumed by &#1500;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;. And secondly, neither of these explanations furnishes a suitable meaning. If the words of God only followed in <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/2-9.htm">Zechariah 2:9</a>, &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; in the first clause would be left without any noun to which to refer; and if they commenced with &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1490;&#1506; (for he that toucheth), the thought "he that toucheth you," etc., would assign no reason for the call to flee and save themselves. For if Israel is defended or valued by God as a pupil of the eye, there can be no necessity for it to flee. And lastly, it is impossible to see what can be the meaning or object of the parenthesis, "After glory hath He sent me," etc. If it treated "of the execution of the threat of punishment upon the heathen" (Koehler), it would be inserted in an unsuitable place, since the threat of punishment would not follow till afterwards. All these difficulties vanish if Jehovah's words commence with 'achar ka&#770;bho&#772;d (after glory), in which case shela&#770;chan&#305;&#772; (He hath sent me) may be very simply explained from the fact that the address is introduced, not in a direct form, but indirectly: Jehovah says, He has sent me after glory. The sender is Jehovah, and the person sent is not the prophet, but the angel of the Lord. Achar ka&#770;bho&#772;d: behind glory, after glory; not however "after the glory of success" (Hitzig, Ewald, etc.), still less "with a glorious commission," but to get glory upon the heathen, i.e., to display the glory of God upon the heathen through the judgment by which their power is broken, and the heathen world is made to serve the people of God. The manner in which the next two clauses, commencing with k&#305;&#772; (for), are attached, is the following: The first assigns the subjective motive; that is to say, states the reason why God has sent him to the heathen, namely, because they have plundered His people, and have thereby touched the apple of His eye. &#1489;&#1468;&#1489;&#1514; &#1506;&#1497;&#1503;, the apple of the eye (lit., the gate, the opening in which the eye is placed, or more probably the pupil of the eye, pupilla, as being the object most carefully preserved), is a figure used to denote the dearest possession or good, and in this sense is applied to the nation of Israel as early as <a href="/deuteronomy/32-10.htm">Deuteronomy 32:10</a>. The second explanatory clause in <a href="/zechariah/2-9.htm">Zechariah 2:9</a> adds the practical ground for this sending after glory. The speaker is still the angel of the Lord; and his acting is identical with the acting of God. Like Jehovah, he swings his hand over the heathen nations which plundered Israel (cf. <a href="/isaiah/11-15.htm">Isaiah 11:15</a>; <a href="/isaiah/19-16.htm">Isaiah 19:16</a>), and they become (&#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468; expressing the consequence), i.e., so that they become, booty to the Israelites, who had previously been obliged to serve them (cf. <a href="/isaiah/14-2.htm">Isaiah 14:2</a>). In what way the heathen would serve Israel is stated in <a href="/zechariah/2-11.htm">Zechariah 2:11</a>. By the execution of this judgment Israel would learn that Jehovah had sent His angel, namely to execute upon the heathen His saving purposes for Israel. This is the meaning of these words, not only here and in <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/2-11.htm">Zechariah 2:11</a>, but also in <a href="/zechariah/4-9.htm">Zechariah 4:9</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/6-15.htm">Zechariah 6:15</a>, where this formula is repeated, not however in the sense imagined by Koehler, namely that he had spoken these words in consequence of a command from Jehovah, and not of his own accord, by which the "sending" is changed into "speaking." </body></html>
