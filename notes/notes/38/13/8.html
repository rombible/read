God the Father gave order to the sword of his justice to awake against his Son, when he freely made his soul an offering for sin. As God, he is called my Fellow. Christ and the Father are one. He is the Shepherd who was to lay down his life for the sheep. If a Sacrifice, he must be slain, for without shedding of the life-blood there was no remission. This sword must awake against him, yet he had no sin of his own to answer for. It may refer to the whole of Christ's sufferings, especially his agonies in the garden and on the cross, when he endured unspeakable anguish till Divine justice was fully satisfied. Smite the Shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered. This passage our Lord Jesus declares was fulfilled, when all his disciples, in the night wherein he was betrayed, forsook him and fled. It has, and shall have its accomplishment, in the destruction of the corrupt and hypocritical part of the professed church. Because of the sin of the Jews in rejecting and crucifying Christ, and in opposing his gospel, the Romans would destroy the greater part. But a remnant would be saved. And if we are his people, we shall be refined as gold; he will be God, and the end of all our trials and sufferings will be praise, and honour, and glory, at the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/zechariah/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In all the land, two parts therein shall be cut off and die - "In all the land of Israel," says a Jewish interpreter; (Kimchi); " - the land, in which the Good Shepherd had been slain and the sheep scattered, "that upon you." our Lord had said, "may come all the righteous blood."

"Ho, ho, flee out of the land of the north, is the saying of Jehovah; for I spread you out as the four winds of heaven, is the saying of Jehovah. <a href="/zechariah/2-7.htm">Zechariah 2:7</a>. Ho, Zion, save thyself, thou that dwellest with the daughter Babel. <a href="/zechariah/2-8.htm">Zechariah 2:8</a>. For thus saith Jehovah of hosts, After glory hath he sent me to the nations that have plundered you; for whoever toucheth you, toucheth the apple of His eye. <a href="/zechariah/2-9.htm">Zechariah 2:9</a>. For, behold, I swing my hand over them, and they become a spoil to those who served them; and ye will see that Jehovah of hosts hath sent me." The summons to flee out of Babylon, in <a href="/zechariah/2-6.htm">Zechariah 2:6</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/2-7.htm">Zechariah 2:7</a>, is addressed to the Israelites, who are all included in the one name Zion in <a href="/zechariah/2-7.htm">Zechariah 2:7</a>; and shows that the address which follows is not a simple continuation of the promise in <a href="/zechariah/2-4.htm">Zechariah 2:4</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/2-5.htm">Zechariah 2:5</a>, but is intended both to explain it, and to assign the reason for it. The summons contains so far a reason for it, that the Israelites are directed to flee out of Babylon, because the judgment is about to burst upon this oppressor of the people of God. The words nu&#772;su&#772;, flee, and himma&#770;let&#305;&#772;, save thyself or escape, both point to the judgment, and in <a href="/zechariah/2-9.htm">Zechariah 2:9</a> the judgment itself is clearly spoken of. the land of the north is Babylon (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/1-14.htm">Jeremiah 1:14</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/6-22.htm">Jeremiah 6:22</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/10-22.htm">Jeremiah 10:22</a>; and for the fact itself, <a href="/isaiah/48-20.htm">Isaiah 48:20</a>). The reason for the exclamation "Flee" is first of all given in the clause, "for like the four winds have I spread you out," not "dispersed you" (Vulg., C. B. Mich., Koehler). For apart from the fact that pe&#772;re&#772;s almost always means to spread out, and has the meaning to disperse at the most in <a href="/psalms/68-15.htm">Psalm 68:15</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-21.htm">Ezekiel 17:21</a>, this meaning is altogether unsuitable here. For if Israel had been scattered like the four winds, it would of necessity have been summoned to return, not only from the north, but from all quarters of the globe (Hitzig, Kliefoth). Moreover, we should then have &#1500;&#1488;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;, into the four winds; and the method suggested by Koehler for reconciling &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506; with his view, viz., by assuming that "like the four winds" is equivalent to "as chaff is pounded and driven away from its place by the four winds," according to which the winds would be mentioned in the place of the chaff, will hardly meet with approval. The explanation is rather that the perfect pe&#772;rast&#305;&#772; is used prophetically to denote the purpose of God, which had already been formed, even if its realization was still in the future. To spread out like the four winds is the same as to spread out just as the four winds spread out to all quarters of the globe. Because God has resolved upon spreading out His people in this manner, they are to flee out of Babel, that they may not suffer the fate of Babel. That this thought lies at the foundation of the motive assigned, is evident from the further reasons assigned for the summons in <a href="/zechariah/2-8.htm">Zechariah 2:8</a> and <a href="/zechariah/2-9.htm">Zechariah 2:9</a>.<p>Zion stands for the inhabitants of Zion, namely the people of God, who are for the time being still yo&#772;shebheth bath Ba&#770;bel, dwelling with the daughter Babel. As Zion does not mean the city or fortress of Jerusalem, but the inhabitants, so the "daughter Babel" is not the city of Babylon or country of Babylonia personified, but the inhabitants of Babel; and &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; is construed with the accusative of the person, as in <a href="/psalms/22-4.htm">Psalm 22:4</a> and <a href="/2_samuel/6-2.htm">2 Samuel 6:2</a>. What Jehovah states in explanation of the twofold call to flee out of Babel, does not commence with <a href="/zechariah/2-9.htm">Zechariah 2:9</a> (Ewald), or with &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1490;&#1506; in <a href="/zechariah/2-8.htm">Zechariah 2:8</a> (Koehler), but with &#1488;&#1495;&#1512; &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;. The incorrectness of the two former explanations is seen first of all in the fact that &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; only introduces a speech in the same manner as &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;, when it follows directly upon the introductory formula; but not, as is here assumed, when a long parenthesis is inserted between, without the introduction being resumed by &#1500;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;. And secondly, neither of these explanations furnishes a suitable meaning. If the words of God only followed in <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/2-9.htm">Zechariah 2:9</a>, &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; in the first clause would be left without any noun to which to refer; and if they commenced with &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1490;&#1506; (for he that toucheth), the thought "he that toucheth you," etc., would assign no reason for the call to flee and save themselves. For if Israel is defended or valued by God as a pupil of the eye, there can be no necessity for it to flee. And lastly, it is impossible to see what can be the meaning or object of the parenthesis, "After glory hath He sent me," etc. If it treated "of the execution of the threat of punishment upon the heathen" (Koehler), it would be inserted in an unsuitable place, since the threat of punishment would not follow till afterwards. All these difficulties vanish if Jehovah's words commence with 'achar ka&#770;bho&#772;d (after glory), in which case shela&#770;chan&#305;&#772; (He hath sent me) may be very simply explained from the fact that the address is introduced, not in a direct form, but indirectly: Jehovah says, He has sent me after glory. The sender is Jehovah, and the person sent is not the prophet, but the angel of the Lord. Achar ka&#770;bho&#772;d: behind glory, after glory; not however "after the glory of success" (Hitzig, Ewald, etc.), still less "with a glorious commission," but to get glory upon the heathen, i.e., to display the glory of God upon the heathen through the judgment by which their power is broken, and the heathen world is made to serve the people of God. The manner in which the next two clauses, commencing with k&#305;&#772; (for), are attached, is the following: The first assigns the subjective motive; that is to say, states the reason why God has sent him to the heathen, namely, because they have plundered His people, and have thereby touched the apple of His eye. &#1489;&#1468;&#1489;&#1514; &#1506;&#1497;&#1503;, the apple of the eye (lit., the gate, the opening in which the eye is placed, or more probably the pupil of the eye, pupilla, as being the object most carefully preserved), is a figure used to denote the dearest possession or good, and in this sense is applied to the nation of Israel as early as <a href="/deuteronomy/32-10.htm">Deuteronomy 32:10</a>. The second explanatory clause in <a href="/zechariah/2-9.htm">Zechariah 2:9</a> adds the practical ground for this sending after glory. The speaker is still the angel of the Lord; and his acting is identical with the acting of God. Like Jehovah, he swings his hand over the heathen nations which plundered Israel (cf. <a href="/isaiah/11-15.htm">Isaiah 11:15</a>; <a href="/isaiah/19-16.htm">Isaiah 19:16</a>), and they become (&#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468; expressing the consequence), i.e., so that they become, booty to the Israelites, who had previously been obliged to serve them (cf. <a href="/isaiah/14-2.htm">Isaiah 14:2</a>). In what way the heathen would serve Israel is stated in <a href="/zechariah/2-11.htm">Zechariah 2:11</a>. By the execution of this judgment Israel would learn that Jehovah had sent His angel, namely to execute upon the heathen His saving purposes for Israel. This is the meaning of these words, not only here and in <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/2-11.htm">Zechariah 2:11</a>, but also in <a href="/zechariah/4-9.htm">Zechariah 4:9</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/6-15.htm">Zechariah 6:15</a>, where this formula is repeated, not however in the sense imagined by Koehler, namely that he had spoken these words in consequence of a command from Jehovah, and not of his own accord, by which the "sending" is changed into "speaking." </body></html>
