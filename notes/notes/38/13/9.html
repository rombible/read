God the Father gave order to the sword of his justice to awake against his Son, when he freely made his soul an offering for sin. As God, he is called my Fellow. Christ and the Father are one. He is the Shepherd who was to lay down his life for the sheep. If a Sacrifice, he must be slain, for without shedding of the life-blood there was no remission. This sword must awake against him, yet he had no sin of his own to answer for. It may refer to the whole of Christ's sufferings, especially his agonies in the garden and on the cross, when he endured unspeakable anguish till Divine justice was fully satisfied. Smite the Shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered. This passage our Lord Jesus declares was fulfilled, when all his disciples, in the night wherein he was betrayed, forsook him and fled. It has, and shall have its accomplishment, in the destruction of the corrupt and hypocritical part of the professed church. Because of the sin of the Jews in rejecting and crucifying Christ, and in opposing his gospel, the Romans would destroy the greater part. But a remnant would be saved. And if we are his people, we shall be refined as gold; he will be God, and the end of all our trials and sufferings will be praise, and honour, and glory, at the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/zechariah/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I will bring the third part through the fire - Such is always God's ways.

"Adversities are granted to the elect of God, and therefore to be rejoiced in with the whole heart."

Osorius: "Whose virtue they adimired, these they imitated, and shared the suffering, that they might be partakers of the glory.

"Exult and rejoice, O daughter Zion: for, behold, I come, and dwell in the midst of thee, is the saying of Jehovah. <a href="/zechariah/2-11.htm">Zechariah 2:11</a>. And many nations will attach themselves to Jehovah in that day, and become a people to me: and I dwell in the midst of thee; and thou wilt know that Jehovah of hosts hath sent me to thee." The daughter Zion, or the church of the Lord, delivered out of Babel, is to rejoice with joy, because her glorification is commencing now. The Lord comes to her in His angel, in whom are His name (<a href="/exodus/23-21.htm">Exodus 23:21</a>), and His face (<a href="/exodus/33-14.htm">Exodus 33:14</a>), i.e., the angel of His face (<a href="/isaiah/63-9.htm">Isaiah 63:9</a>), who reveals His nature, to dwell in the midst of her. This dwelling of Jehovah, or of His angel, in the midst of Zion, is essentially different from the dwelling of Jehovah in the Most Holy Place of His temple. It commences with the coming of the Son of God in the flesh, and is completed by His return in glory (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a> and <a href="/revelation/21-3.htm">Revelation 21:3</a>). Then will many, or powerful, nations, attach themselves to Jehovah, and become His people (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/8-20.htm">Zechariah 8:20-21</a>; <a href="/isaiah/14-1.htm">Isaiah 14:1</a>). This kingdom of God, which has hitherto been restricted to Israel, will be spread out and glorified by the reception of the heathen nations which are seeking God (<a href="/micah/4-2.htm">Micah 4:2</a>). The repetition of the expression, "I dwell in the midst of thee," merely serves as a stronger asseveration of this brilliant promise; and the same remark applies to the repetition of &#1493;&#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; (and thou shalt now): see at <a href="/zechariah/2-13.htm">Zechariah 2:13</a>. Jerusalem will thereby receive the expansion shown to the prophet in <a href="/zechariah/2-4.htm">Zechariah 2:4</a>; and through the dwelling of God in the midst of her, the promise in <a href="/zechariah/2-5.htm">Zechariah 2:5</a> will also be fulfilled. The next verse refers to this. </body></html>
