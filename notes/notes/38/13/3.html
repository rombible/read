Even the atoning blood of Christ, united with his sanctifying grace. It has hitherto been closed to the unbelieving nation of Israel; but when the Spirit of grace shall humble and soften their hearts, he will open it to them also. This fountain opened is the pierced side of Christ. We are all as an unclean thing. Behold a fountain opened for us to wash in, and streams flowing to us from that fountain. The blood of Christ, and God's pardoning mercy in that blood, made known in the new covenant, are a fountain always flowing, that never can be emptied. It is opened for all believers, who as the spiritual seed of Christ, are of the house of David, and, as living members of the church, are inhabitants of Jerusalem. Christ, by the power of his grace, takes away the dominion of sin, even of beloved sins. Those who are washed in the fountain opened, as they are justified, so they are sanctified. Souls are brought off from the world and the flesh, those two great idols, that they may cleave to God only. The thorough reformation which will take place on the conversion of Israel to Christ, is here foretold. False prophets shall be convinced of their sin and folly, and return to their proper employments. When convinced that we are gone out of the way of duty, we must show the truth of our repentance by returning to it again. It is well to acknowledge those to be friends, who by severe discipline are instrumental in bringing us to a sight of error; for faithful are the wounds of a friend, Pr 27:6. And it is always well for us to recollect the wounds of our Saviour. Often has he been wounded by professed friends, nay, even by his real disciples, when they act contrary to his word.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/zechariah/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>His father and mother that begat him shall say unto him, Thou shalt not live - The prophet describes the zeal against false prophecy, with reference to the law against those who seduced to apostasy from God. <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/13-6.htm">Deuteronomy 13:6-10</a> : "the nearest relations were themselves to denounce any who had secretly tried to seduce them, and themselves, as the accusers, to cast the first stone at them.

The form of phraseology here is drawn from De 13:6-10; 18:20. The substantial truth expressed is that false prophecy shall be utterly abolished. If it were possible for it again to start up, the very parents of the false prophet would not let parental affection interfere, but would be the first to thrust him through. Love to Christ must be paramount to the tenderest of natural ties (Mt 10:37).

Here the holy zeal of the parents should put the law in force. This was quite a different state of things from that which obtained in former times. The earlier prophets continually  complain of the favour shown to these deceivers (comp. <a href="/isaiah/9-15.htm">Isaiah 9:15</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/5-31.htm">Jeremiah 5:31</a>; <a href="/micah/2-11.htm">Micah 2:11</a>); and we never read of the legal punishment being inflicted after due investigation, the test being the nonfulfilment of the prediction (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-22.htm">Deuteronomy 18:22</a>). In the new theocracy, so great is the recoil from such pretenders, that their nearest relations shall at once punish them with death without any previous legal process. <span class="cmt_word">Shall thrust him through.</span> Stab, pierce him, put him to death, as in ch. 12:10. The gospel deals more tenderly with heretics (<a href="/luke/9-55.htm">Luke 9:55</a>). "Defendenda religio non est occidendo," says Laetant. ('Div. Inst.,' 5:20), "sed moriendo; religio cogi non potest " (Wordsworth, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/zechariah/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Whilst the second vision sets forth the destruction of the powers that were hostile to Israel, the third (<a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/2-1.htm">Zechariah 2:1-5</a>) with the prophetic explanation (<a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/2-6.htm">Zechariah 2:6-13</a>) shows the development of the people and kingdom of God till the time of its final glory. The vision itself appears very simple, only a few of the principal features being indicated; but in this very brevity it presents many difficulties so far as the exposition is concerned. It is as follows: <a href="/zechariah/2-1.htm">Zechariah 2:1</a>. "And I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and behold a man, and in his hand a measuring line. <a href="/zechariah/2-2.htm">Zechariah 2:2</a>. Then I said, Whither goest thou? And he said to me, To measure Jerusalem, to see how great its breadth, and how great its length. <a href="/zechariah/2-3.htm">Zechariah 2:3</a>. And, behold, the angel that talked with me went out, and another angel went out to meet him. <a href="/zechariah/2-4.htm">Zechariah 2:4</a>. And he said to him, Run, speak to his young man thus: Jerusalem shall lie as an open land for the multitude of men and cattle in the midst of it. <a href="/zechariah/2-5.htm">Zechariah 2:5</a>. And I shall be to it, is the saying of Jehovah, a fiery wall round about; and I shall be for glory in the midst of it." The man with the measuring line in his hand is not the interpreting angel (C. B. Mich., Ros., Maurer, etc.); for it was not his duty to place the events upon the stage, but simply to explain to the prophet the things which he saw. Moreover, this angel is clearly distinguished from the man, inasmuch as he does not go out (<a href="/zechariah/2-3.htm">Zechariah 2:3</a>) till after the latter has gone to measure Jerusalem (<a href="/zechariah/2-2.htm">Zechariah 2:2</a>). At the same time, we cannot regard the measuring man as merely "a figure in the vision," since all the persons occurring in these visions are significant; but we agree with those who conjecture that he is the angel of Jehovah, although this conjecture cannot be distinctly proved. The task which he is preparing to perform - namely, to measure Jerusalem - leads unquestionably to the conclusion that he is something more than a figure. The measuring of the breadth and length of Jerusalem presupposes that the city is already in existence; and this expression must not be identified with the phrase, to draw the measure over Jerusalem, in <a href="/zechariah/1-15.htm">Zechariah 1:15</a>. Drawing the measure over a place is done for the purpose of sketching a plan for its general arrangement or the rebuilding of it. But the length and breadth of a city can only be measured when it is already in existence; and the object of the measuring is not to see how long and how broad it is to be, but what the length and breadth actually are. It is true that it by no means follows from this that the city to be measured was the Jerusalem of that time; on the contrary, the vision shows the future Jerusalem, but it exhibits it as a city in actual existence, and visible to the spiritual eye. While the man goes away to measure the city, the interpreting angel goes out: not out of the myrtle thicket, for this only occurs in the first vision; but he goes away from the presence of the prophet, where we have to think of him as his interpreter, in the direction of the man with the measuring line, to find out what he is going to do, and bring back word to the prophet. At the very same time another angel comes out to meet him, viz., the angelus interpres, not the man with the measuring line. For one person can only come to meet another when the latter is going in the direction from which the former comes. Having come to meet him, he (the second angel) says to him (the angelus interpres), "Run, say to this young man," etc. The subject to &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; can only be the second angel; for if, on grammatical grounds, the angelus interpres might be regarded as speaking to the young man, such an assumption is proved to be untenable, by the fact that it was no part of the office of the angelus interpres to give orders or commissions to another angel. On the other hand, there is nothing at all to preclude another angel from revealing a decree of God to the angelus interpres for him to communicate to the prophet; inasmuch as this does not bring the angelus interpres into action any further than his function requires, so that there is no ground for the objection that this is at variance with his standing elsewhere (Kliefoth). But the other angel could not give the instructions mentioned in <a href="/zechariah/1-4.htm">Zechariah 1:4</a> to the angelus interpres, unless he were either himself a superior angel, viz., the angel of Jehovah, or had been directed to do so by the man with the measuring line, in which case this "man" would be the angel of Jehovah. Of these two possibilities we prefer the latter on two grounds: (1) because it is impossible to think of any reason why the "other angel" should not be simply called &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1498; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;, if he really were the angel of the Lord; and (2) because, according to the analogy of <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-3.htm">Ezekiel 40:3</a>, the man with the measuring line most probably was the angel of Jehovah, with whose dignity it would be quite in keeping that he should explain his purpose to the angelus interpres through the medium of another (inferior) angel. And if this be established, so far as the brevity of the account will allow, we cannot understand by the "young man" the man with the measuring line, as Hitzig, Maurer, and Kliefoth do. The only way in which such an assumption as this could be rendered tenable or in harmony with the rest, would be by supposing that the design of the message was to tell the man with the measuring line that "he might desist from his useless enterprise" (Hitzig), as Jerusalem could not be measured at all, on account of the number of its inhabitants and its vast size (Theod. Mops., Theodoret, Ewald, Umbreit, etc.); but Kliefoth has very justly replied to this, that "if a city be ever so great, inasmuch as it is a city, it can always be measured, and also have walls."<p>If, then, the symbolical act of measuring, as Kliefoth also admits, expresses the question how large and how broad Jerusalem will eventually be, and if the words of <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/2-4.htm">Zechariah 2:4</a>, <a href="/zechariah/2-5.htm">Zechariah 2:5</a> contain the answer to this question, viz., Jerusalem will in the first place (<a href="/zechariah/2-4.htm">Zechariah 2:4</a>) contain such a multitude of men and cattle that it will dwell like pera&#770;zo&#772;th; this answer, which gives the meaning of the measuring, must be addressed not to the measuring man, but simply to the prophet, that he may announce to the people the future magnitude and glory of the city. The measuring man was able to satisfy himself of this by the measuring itself. We must therefore follow the majority of both the earlier and later expositors, and take the "young man" as being the prophet himself, who is so designated on account of his youthful age, and without any allusion whatever to "human inexperience and dim short-sightedness" (Hengstenberg), since such an allusion would be very remote from the context, and even old men of experience could not possibly know anything concerning the future glory of Jerusalem without a revelation from above. Halla&#770;z, as in <a href="/judges/6-20.htm">Judges 6:20</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/4-25.htm">2 Kings 4:25</a>, is a contraction of halla&#770;zeh, and formed from la&#770;zeh, there, thither, and the article hal, in the sense of the (young man) there, or that young man (cf. Ewald, 103, a, and 183, b; Ges. 34, Anm. 1). He is to make haste and bring this message, because it is good news, the realization of which will soon commence. The message contains a double and most joyful promise. (1) Jerusalem will in future dwell, i.e., to be built, as pera&#770;zo&#772;th. This word means neither "without walls," nor loca aperta, but strictly speaking the plains, and is only used in the plural to denote the open, level ground, as contrasted with the fortified cities surrounded by walls: thus &#8219;a&#772;re&#772; pera&#770;zo&#772;th, cities of the plain, in <a href="//biblehub.com/esther/9-19.htm">Esther 9:19</a>, as distinguished from the capital Susa; and 'erets pera&#770;zo&#772;th in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-11.htm">Ezekiel 38:11</a>, the land where men dwell "without walls, bolts, and gates;" hence pera&#770;z&#305;&#772;, inhabitant of the plain, in contrast with the inhabitants of fortified cities with high walls (<a href="/deuteronomy/3-5.htm">Deuteronomy 3:5</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/6-18.htm">1 Samuel 6:18</a>). The thought is therefore the following: Jerusalem is in future to resemble an open country covered with unwalled cities and villages; it will no longer be a city closely encircled with walls; hence it will be extraordinarily enlarged, on account of the multitude of men and cattle with which it will be blessed (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/49-19.htm">Isaiah 49:19-20</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/38-11.htm">Ezekiel 38:11</a>). Moreover, (2) Jerusalem will then have no protecting wall surrounding it, because it will enjoy a superior protection. Jehovah will be to it a wall of fire round about, that is to say, a defence of fire which will consume every one who ventures to attack it (cf. <a href="/isaiah/4-5.htm">Isaiah 4:5</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/4-24.htm">Deuteronomy 4:24</a>). Jehovah will also be the glory in the midst of Jerusalem, that is to say, will fill the city with His glory (cf. <a href="/isaiah/60-19.htm">Isaiah 60:19</a>). This promise is explained in the following prophetic words which are uttered by the angel of Jehovah, as <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/2-8.htm">Zechariah 2:8</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/2-9.htm">Zechariah 2:9</a>, and <a href="/zechariah/2-11.htm">Zechariah 2:11</a> clearly show. According to these verses, for example, the speaker is sent by Jehovah, and according to <a href="/zechariah/2-8.htm">Zechariah 2:8</a> to the nations which have plundered Israel, "after glory," i.e., to smite these nations and make them servants to the Israelites. From this shall Israel learn that Jehovah has sent him. The fact that, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/2-3.htm">Zechariah 2:3</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/2-4.htm">Zechariah 2:4</a>, another angel speaks to the prophet, may be easily reconciled with this. For since this angel, as we have seen above, was sent by the angel of Jehovah, he speaks according to his instructions, and that in such a manner that his words pass imperceptibly into the words of the sender, just as we very frequently find the words of a prophet passing suddenly into the words of God, and carried on as such. For the purpose of escaping from this simple conclusion, Koehler has forcibly broken up this continuous address, and has separated the words of <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/2-8.htm">Zechariah 2:8</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/2-9.htm">Zechariah 2:9</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/2-11.htm">Zechariah 2:11</a>, in which the angel says that Jehovah has sent him, from the words of Jehovah proclaimed by the angel, as being interpolations, but without succeeding in explaining them either simply or naturally. </body></html>
