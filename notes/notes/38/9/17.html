He took the character of their King, when he entered Jerusalem amidst the hosannas of the multitude. But his kingdom is a spiritual kingdom. It shall not be advanced by outward force or carnal weapons. His gospel shall be preached to the world, and be received among the heathen. A sinful state is a state of bondage; it is a pit, or dungeon, in which there is no water, no comfort; and we are all by nature prisoners in this pit. Through the precious blood of Christ, many prisoners of Satan have been set at liberty from the horrible pit in which they must otherwise have perished, without hope or comfort. While we admire Him, let us seek that his holiness and truth may be shown in our own spirits and conduct. These promises have accomplishment in the spiritual blessings of the gospel which we enjoy by Jesus Christ. As the deliverance of the Jews was typical of redemption by Christ, so this invitation speaks to all the language of the gospel call. Sinners are prisoners, but prisoners of hope; their case is sad, but not desperate; for there is hope in Israel concerning them. Christ is a Strong-hold, a strong Tower, in whom believers are safe from the fear of the wrath of God, the curse of the law, and the assaults of spiritual enemies. To him we must turn with lively faith; to him we must flee, and trust in his name under all trials and sufferings. It is here promised that the Lord would deliver his people. This passage also refers to the apostles, and the preachers of the gospel in the early ages. God was evidently with them; his words from their lips pierced the hearts and consciences of the hearers. They were wondrously defended in persecution, and were filled with the influences of the Holy Spirit. They were saved by the Good Shepherd as his flock, and honoured as jewels of his crown. The gifts, graces, and consolations of the Spirit, poured forth on the day of Pentecost, Ac 2 and in succeeding times, are represented. Sharp have been, and still will be, the conflicts of Zion's sons, but their God will give them success. The more we are employed, and satisfied with his goodness, the more we shall admire the beauty revealed in the Redeemer. Whatever gifts God bestows on us, we must serve him cheerfully with them; and, when refreshed with blessings, we must say, How great is his goodness!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/zechariah/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For how great is His goodness - For it is unutterable! As the Psalmist said, "O Lord, our Lord, how excellent is Thy Name in all the earth!" <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/8-1.htm">Psalm 8:1</a>, and Jacob, "How awful is this place!" <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/28-17.htm">Genesis 28:17</a>, and the Psalmist, "How awful are Thy doings!" The goodness and the beauty are the goodness and beauty of God, whose great doings had been his theme throughout before. Of the goodness the sacred writers often speak , since of this we have extremest need. And this He showed to Moses, "I will cause all My goodness to pass before thy face" <a href="/exodus/33-19.htm">Exodus 33:19</a>. Of this we know somewhat personally in this life; for beside the surpassing. amazingness of it in the work of our redemption, we are surrounded by it, immersed in it, as in a fathomless, shoreless ocean of infinite love, which finds entrance into our souls, whenever we bar it not out.<p>Goodness is that attribute of God, whereby He loveth to communicate to all, who can or will receive it, all good; yea, Himself , "who is the fullness and universality of good, Creator of all good, not in one way, not in one kind of goodness only, but absolutely, without beginning, without limit, without measure, save that whereby without measurement He possesseth and embraceth all excellence, all perfection, all blessedness, all good." This Good His Goodness bestoweth on all and each, according to the capacity of each to receive it, nor is there any limit to His giving, save His creature's capacity of receiving, which also is a good gift from Him. "From Him all things sweet derive their sweetness; all things fair, their beauty; all things bright, their splendor; all things that live, their life; all things sentient, their sense; all that move, their vigor; all intelligences, their knowledge; all things perfect, their perfection; all things in any wise good, their goodness."<p>The beauty of God - Belongs rather to the beatific vision. Yet David speaks of the Beauty of Christ, "Thou art exceeding fairer then the children of men" <a href="/psalms/45-2.htm">Psalm 45:2</a>; and Isaiah says, "Thine eyes shall behold the King in His beauty" <a href="/isaiah/33-17.htm">Isaiah 33:17</a>. But the Beauty of God "eye hath not seen nor ear heard nor can heart of man conceive." Here, on earth, created beauty can, at least when suddenly seen, hold the frame motionless, pierce the soul, glue the heart to it, entrance the affections. Light from heaven kindles into beauty our dullest material substances; the soul in grace diffuses beauty over the dullest human countenance; the soul, ere it has passed from the body, has been known to catch, through the half-opened portals, such brilliancy of light, that the eye even for some time after death has retained a brightness, beyond anything of earth .  "The earth's form of beauty is a sort of voice of the dumb earth. Doth not, on considering the beauty of this universe, its very form answer thee with one voice, 'Not I made myself, but God?'" Poets have said:<p>"Old friends ... shall lovelier be,<p>As more of heaven in each we see,"<p>(Christian Year. Morning Hymn.)<p>Or,<p>"When he saw,<p>" - God within him light his face."<p>(Tennyson, In memoriam. T. has "The God.")<p>And Holy Scripture tells us that when Stephen, "full of faith and of the Holy Spirit," was about to speak of Jesus to the council which arraigned him, "all that sat in the council, looking steadfastly at him, saw his face as it had been the face of an angel" <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/6-5.htm">Acts 6:5</a>, <a href="/acts/6-15.htm">Acts 6:15</a>. It has been said, that if we could see a soul in grace, its beauty would so pierce us, that we should die. But the natural beauty of the soul transcends all corporeal beauty which so attracts us; the natural beauty of the last angel surpasseth all natural beauty of soul. If we could ascend from the most beautiful form, which the soul could here imagine, to the least glorious body of the beatified, on and on through the countless thousands of glorious bodies, compared wherewith heaven would be dark and the sun lose its shining; and yet more from the most beautiful deified soul, as visible here, to the beauty of the disembodied soul, whose image would scarce be recognized, because , "the bodily eyes gleamed with angelic radiancy;" yea, let the God-enlightened soul go on and on, through all those choirs of the heavenly hierarchies, clad with the raiment of Divinity, from choir to choir, from hierarchy to hierarchy, admiring the order and beauty and harmony of the house of God; yea, let it, aided by divine grace and light, ascend even higher, and reach the bound and term of all created beauty, yet it must know that the divine power and wisdom could create other creatures, far more perfect and beautiful than all which He hath hitherto created.<p>Nay, let the highest of all the Seraphs sum in one all the beauty by nature and grace and glory of all creatures, yet could it not be satisfied with that beauty, but must, because it was not satisfied with it, conceive some higher beauty. Were God immediately, at every moment to create that higher beauty at its wish, it could still conceive something beyond; for, not being God, its beauty could not satisfy its conception. So let him still, and in hundred thousand, hundred thousand, thousand years with swiftest flight of understanding multiply continually those degrees of beauty, so that each fresh degree should ever double that preceding, and the divine power should, with like swiftness, concur in creating that beauty, as in the beginning He said, "let there be light and there was light;" after all those millions of years, he would be again. at the beginning, and there would be no comparison between it and the divine beauty of Jesus Christ, God and Man. For it is the bliss of the finite not to reach the Infinite . That city of the blest which is lightened by the glory of God, and the Lamb is the light thereof, sees It, enabled by God, as created eye can see It, and is held fast to God in one jubilant exstacy of everlasting love.<p> "The prophet, borne out of himself by consideration of the divine goodness, stands amazed, while he contemplates the beauty and Deity of Christ: he bursts out with unaccustomed admiration! How great is His goodness, who, to guard His flock, shall come down on earth to lay down His life for the salvation of His sheep! How great His beauty, who is the ""brightnesss of the glory and the Image of the Father," and comprises in His Godhead the measure of all order and beauty! With what firm might does He strengthen, with what joy does He overwhelm the souls which gaze most frequently on His beauty, and gives largely and bountifully that corn, by whose strength the youths are made strong. He supplieth abundantly the wine, whereby the virgins, on fire with His love, are exhilarated and beautified. But both are necessary, that the strength of the strong should be upheld by the "bread from heaven," and that sound and uncorrupt minds, melted with the sweetness of love, should be recreated with wine, that is, the sweetness of the Holy Spirit, and be borne aloft with great joy, in the midst of extreme toils. For all who keep holily the faith of Christ, may be called "youths," for their unconquered strength, and virgins for their purity and integrity of soul. For all these that heavenly bread is prepared, that their strength be not weakened, and the wine is inpoured, that they be not only refreshed, but may live in utmost sweetness." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/zechariah/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17. his goodness &#8230; his beauty&#8212;the goodness and beauty which Jehovah-Messiah bestows on His people.

If the affix "his" is referred to Jehovah, the nouns "goodness" and "beauty" must be taken, not as his attributes, but as gifts bestowed by him, the prosperity and beauty which he confers. But it is more suitable to the context to consider the reference to be to the people, who in the next clause are divided into young men and maidens, and to take the "goodness," or goodliness, as appertaining more especially to the former, and the "beauty" to the latter. <span class="cmt_word">His beauty</span> (comp. <a href="/ezekiel/16-14.htm">Ezekiel 16:14</a>).

"Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, Ask now the priests for instruction, saying, <a href="/haggai/2-12.htm">Haggai 2:12</a>. Behold, one carries holy flesh in the lappet of his garment, and touches with his lappet the bread, and that which is boiled, the wine, and the oil, and any kind of food: does it then become holy? And the priests answered and said, No. <a href="/haggai/2-13.htm">Haggai 2:13</a>. And Haggai said, If one who is unclean on account of a corpse touches all this, does it become unclean? And the priests answered and said, It does become unclean. <a href="/haggai/2-14.htm">Haggai 2:14</a>. Then Haggai answered and said, So is this people, and so this nation before my face, is the saying of Jehovah; and so is all the work of their hands, and what they offer to me there: it is unclean." In order to impress most earnestly upon the hearts of the people the fact that it was through their sin that they brought upon themselves the failure of crops that had hitherto prevailed, viz., as a punishment from God, the prophet proposes two questions concerning holy and clean for the priests to answer, in order that he may make an application of the answer they give to the moral condition of the nation. To&#772;ra&#770;h in <a href="//biblehub.com/haggai/2-11.htm">Haggai 2:11</a>, without the article, is used in its primary signification of instruction, and is governed by &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1500;, accus. rei: to ask a person anything, for to ask or solicit anything from him. The first question has reference to the communication of the holiness of holy objects to other objects brought into contact with them: whether, if a person carried holy flesh in the lappet of his garment,<p>(Note: Luther: "in the geren of his dress." The gehren, or gehre, middle high German gre, old high German kro (English goar), is a triangular piece, forming the gusset of a dress or shirt, then that portion of the dress in which it is inserted, viz., below the waist, probably derived from the Gothic gis, and the conjectural root geisan  equals  to thrust or strike (Weigand, Germ. Dict.).)<p>and touched any food with the lappet, it would become holy in consequence. He&#772;n, behold, pointing to an action as possible, has almost the force of a conditional particle, "if," as in <a href="/isaiah/54-15.htm">Isaiah 54:15</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/3-1.htm">Jeremiah 3:1</a> (cf. Ewald, 103, g). "Holy flesh" is flesh of animals slain as sacrifices, as in <a href="/jeremiah/11-15.htm">Jeremiah 11:15</a>. Na&#770;z&#305;&#772;d, that which is boiled, boiled food (<a href="/genesis/25-29.htm">Genesis 25:29</a>; <a href="/2_kings/4-38.htm">2 Kings 4:38</a>.). The priests answer the question laid before them quite correctly with "No;" for, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/6-20.htm">Leviticus 6:20</a>, the lappet of the dress itself was made holy by the holy flesh, but it could not communicate this holiness any further. The second question (<a href="/haggai/2-13.htm">Haggai 2:13</a>) has reference to the spread of legal defilement. &#1496;&#1502;&#1488; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; is not one who is unclean in his soul; but, as <a href="/leviticus/22-4.htm">Leviticus 22:4</a> shows, it is synonymous with &#1496;&#1502;&#1488; &#1500;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; in <a href="/numbers/5-2.htm">Numbers 5:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/9-10.htm">Numbers 9:10</a>, "defiled on a soul;" and this is a contraction of &#1496;&#1502;&#1488; &#1500;&#1504;&#1508;&#1512; &#1488;&#1491;&#1501;, or &#1496;&#1502;&#1488; &#1500;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; &#1502;&#1514;, in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/9-6.htm">Numbers 9:6-7</a>, "defiled on (through) the soul of a dead man" (<a href="/numbers/6-6.htm">Numbers 6:6</a>; <a href="/leviticus/21-11.htm">Leviticus 21:11</a> : see at <a href="/leviticus/19-28.htm">Leviticus 19:28</a>), hence one who has been defiled through touching a dead body. This uncleanness was one of the strongest kinds; it lasted seven days, and could only be removed by his being twice purified with sprinkling water, prepared from the ashes of the red cow (see at <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/19.htm">Numbers 19</a>). This question the priests also answered correctly. According to <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/19-22.htm">Numbers 19:22</a>, he who was defiled by touching a dead body made everything unclean that he touched. The prophet now applies these provisions of the law to the ethical relation in which the people stood to Jehovah. "So is this people before me, saith Jehovah." &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497; is quite synonymous with &#1492;&#1506;&#1501;, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-9.htm">Zephaniah 2:9</a>, without any subordinate meaning of a contemptuous kind, which could at the most be contained in hazzeh (this), but in that case would apply to ha&#770;&#8219;a&#770;m just as well. Ke&#772;n, ita, refers to the substance of the two legal questions in <a href="/haggai/2-12.htm">Haggai 2:12</a> and <a href="/haggai/2-13.htm">Haggai 2:13</a>. The nation, in its attitude towards the Lord, resembles, on the one hand, a man who carries holy flesh in the lappet of his garment, and on the other hand, a man who has become unclean through touching a corpse. "Israel also possesses a sanctuary in the midst of its land, - namely, the place which Jehovah has chosen for His own abode, and favoured with many glorious promises. But just as no kind of food, neither bread nor vegetables, neither wine nor oil, is sanctified by the fact that a man touches it with his sanctified garment, so will all this not be rendered holy by the fact that it is planted in the soil of the land which surrounds and encloses the sanctuary of Jehovah. For though the land itself becomes a holy land in consequence, it cannot spread this holiness any further, nor communicate it to what grows upon it. All that Israel raises on its holy land, whether corn, wine, or oil, remains unholy or common. No special blessing rests upon the fruits of this land, on account of the holiness of the land itself, so as of necessity to produce fruitfulness as its result; nor, on the other hand, does it in itself communicate any curse. But if, as experience shows, a curse is resting notwithstanding upon the productions of this land, it arises from the fact that they are unclean because Israel has planted them. For Israel it utterly unclean on account of its neglect of the house of Jehovah, like a man who has become unclean through touching a corpse. Everything that Israel takes hold of, or upon which it lays its hand, everything that it plants and cultivates, is from the very first affected with the curse of uncleanness; and consequently even the sacrifices which it offers there upon the altar of Jehovah are unclean" (Koehler). Sha&#770;m, there, i.e., upon the altar built immediately after the return from Babylon (<a href="/ezra/3-3.htm">Ezra 3:3</a>). </body></html>
