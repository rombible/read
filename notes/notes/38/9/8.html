The destruction of the Persian empire, for which it prepared, was in itself of little moment; Alexander's own empire was very brief. As Daniel had foretold, he came, cast down Persia "to the ground, waxed very great, and when he was strong, the great horn was broken" <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/8-7.htm">Daniel 8:7-8</a>. But with the marvelous perception which characterized him, he saw and impressed upon his successors the dependibleness of the Jewish people. When he came into Judaea, he sent to the high priest for aid against Tyre and for the like tribute as he used to pay to Darius, promising that he would not repent of choosing the friendship of the Macedonians . The high priest refused on the ground of the oath, by which his people were bound in fealty to the earthly king of kings, whom Alexander came to subdue.<p>Alexander threatened to teach all, through its fate, to whom fealty was due. This, after the conquest of Gaza, he prepared to fulfill. He came, he saw, he was conquered . Jaddua and his people prayed to God. Taught by God in a dream not to fear, he went to meet the conqueror. The gates of the city were thrown open. There marched out, not an army such as encountered the Romans, but as he had been taught, a multitude in white garments, and the priests going belove in their raiment of fine linen. The high priest, in his apparel of purple and gold, having on his head the mitre, and on it the golden plate , whereon was written the name of God, advanced alone, and the Conqueror, who was expected to give the city to be plundered, and the high priest to be insulted and slain, kissed the name of God, recognizing in the priest one whom lie had seen in the like dress in a dream, who had bidden him, when hesitating, cross to Asia; for that he would go before his army and deliver the Persian empire to him.<p>The result is related to have been, that Alexander promised to allow the Jews in Judea to live according to their own laws, remitted the tribute of every seventh year, acceded beforehand to the terms to be proposed by those in Babylonia and Media, and that many Jews joined his army, under condition that they might live under their own laws.<p>Rationalism, while it remains such, cannot admit of Daniel's prophecies which the high priest showed him, declaring that a Greek should destroy the Persian empire, which Alexander rightly interpreted of himself. But the facts remain; that the conqueror, who, above most, gave way to his anger, bestowed privileges almost incredible on a nation, which under the Medes and Persians had been  "the most despised part of the enslaved;" made them equal in privileges to his own Macedonians , who could hardly brook the absorption of the Persians, although in inferior condition, among themselves .<p>The most despised of the enslaved became the most trusted of the trusted. They became a large portion of the second and third then known cities of the world. They became Alexandrians, Antiochenes, Ephesians , without ceasing to be Jews. The law commanded faithfulness to oaths, and they who despised their religion respected its fruits.<p>The immediate successors of Alexander, Ptolemy Lagi  and Antiochus Nicator, followed his policy; Ptolemy especially on the ground of the fealty shown to Darius; Nicator, as having observed their faithfulness as soldiers, who had served with him ; but they were so enrolled on this visit to Jerusalem. The pagan kings multiplied, in their own purpose, faithful subjects to themselves; in God's design, they prepared in Asia and Egypt a seed-plot for the Gospel. The settlement of the Jews at Alexandria formed the language of the Gospel; that wonderful blending of the depth of the Hebrew with the clearness and precision of the Greek. Everywhere the seed of the preparatory dispensation was sown, to be fostered, grow and ripen with the harvest of the Gospel.<p>For now have I seen with Mine eyes - This is the counterpart of what the Psalmists and pious people so often pray, "Awake to help me and behold" <a href="/psalms/59-4.htm">Psalm 59:4</a>; "Look down from heaven, behold and visit this vine" <a href="/psalms/80-14.htm">Psalm 80:14</a>; <a href="/psalms/9-13.htm">Psalm 9:13</a>; "Look upon my trouble from them that hate me" "Look upon my affliction and my trouble; look upon my enemies, for they are many" <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/25-18.htm">Psalm 25:18-19</a>; "Look upon my adversity and deliver me" <a href="/psalms/119-153.htm">Psalm 119:153</a>; "O Lord, behold my affliction" (<a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/1-9.htm">Lamentations 1:9</a>, add 11; <a href="/lamentations/2-20.htm">Lamentations 2:20</a>); "Behold, O Lord, for I am in distress" <a href="/lamentations/1-20.htm">Lamentations 1:20</a>; "Look and behold my reproach" <a href="/lamentations/5-1.htm">Lamentations 5:1</a>; "Open Thine eyes, O Lord, and see" <a href="/isaiah/37-17.htm">Isaiah 37:17</a>; <a href="/daniel/9-18.htm">Daniel 9:18</a>; "Look clown from heaven, and behold from the habitation of Thy holiness and glory" <a href="/isaiah/63-15.htm">Isaiah 63:15</a>.

Of profane and wicked men, persecutors and heretics, who rose up in great numbers in the first ages of Christianity against the church, the house of God, where he dwells, which consisted of persons called from among the Gentiles as before; in order to protect and defend them from that great company which opposed them, the Lord encamped about them, partly by his angels, <a href="/psalms/34-7.htm">Psalm 34:7</a> and partly by his ministers, set for the defence of the Gospel; but chiefly by his own power and presence, who is as a fire round about them. The Targum is, <p>"and I will cause my glorious Shechinah to dwell in the house of my sanctuary, and the strength of the arm of my power shall be as a wall of fire round about it.'' <p>Because of him that passeth by, and because of him that returneth; either that his people might pass and repass with safety, who attended the worship and service of his house; or because of Satan and wicked men, who go to and fro, seeking to do all the mischief they can to the saints of the most High. This may, in a literal sense, respect the care of God over the Jewish nation, his church and people, in the times of Alexander, who passed to and fro without distressing them; or in the times of the Lagidae and Seleucidae, the kings of Egypt and Syria, during whose commotions, and their passing to and fro against each other, and against them, were still continued a kingdom. <p>And no oppressor shall pass through them any more; or "exactor" (q); satisfaction for the sins of God's people being exacted, required, and demanded of Christ their surety, it has been given; wherefore no exactor shall pass through them, or over them, to require it of them; not the law, for they are freed by Christ from the exaction, curse, and condemnation of it; not justice, for that is fully satisfied, and infinitely well pleased with the righteousness of Christ; nor Satan, the accuser of the brethren, requiring punishment to be inflicted, which, though he may do it, will be of no avail against them; nor the Jewish tutors and governors, who exacted of the people obedience, not only to the law of Moses, but to the traditions of the elders; since Christ has redeemed his from this vain conversation, Christians are entirely free from that yoke of bondage. This shows that this prophecy is not to be literally understood, since it is certain, that, after the delivery, of it, there were oppressors or exactors among the Jews in a literal sense: Antiochus and others oppressed them before the birth of Christ; they paid tribute to the Romans in his time; he was born at the time of a Roman tax; and, after his death, Titus Vespasian destroyed their nation, and city and temple: or, if it is, "any more" must be understood of a long time, as it were, before they were utterly oppressed. <p>For now I have seen with mine eyes; these are either the words of God the Father, looking with pleasure upon his church and people, about whom he encamps; and upon the satisfaction his Son has given to the divine justice for their sins, whereby they are free from all exactions and oppressions: or of the Prophet Zechariah, as Aben Ezra thinks, who saw with his eyes, in the visions of the night, all that is contained in this prophecy: and now, inasmuch as all this predicted was to be fulfilled in, or near, or about the times of Christ, therefore next follows a glorious prophecy of his coming. <p>(q) "exactor", Pagninus, Montanus, Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator, Cocceius. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/zechariah/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And I will encamp about <span class="cverse3">{k}</span> my house because of the army, because of him that passeth by, and because of him that returneth: and no oppressor shall pass through them any more: for now <span class="cverse3">{l}</span> have I seen with my eyes.</span><p>(k) He shows that God's power alone will be sufficient to defend his Church against all adversaries, be they ever so cruel, or assert their power ever so often.<p>(l) That is, God has now seen the great injuries and afflictions with which they have been afflicted by their enemies.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/zechariah/9.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">8</span>. <span class="ital">about mine house</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">for my house.</span> It is a kind of <span class="ital">dativus commodi</span>.

Bk. xi. c. 8) and from the Talmud is thus related by Dean Stanley. After the conquest of Tyre and Gaza, Alexander had approached Jerusalem, when “suddenly from the city emerged a long procession, the whole population streamed out, dressed in white. The priestly tribe, in their white robes; the High Priest, apparently the chief authority in the place, in his purple and gold attire, his turban on his head, bearing the golden plate on which was inscribed the ineffable name of Jehovah … It was at the sunrise of a winter morning, long afterwards observed as a joyous festival, when they stood before the king. To the astonishment of the surrounding chiefs Alexander descended from his chariot and bowed to the earth before the Jewish leader. None ventured to ask the meaning of this seeming frenzy, save Parmenio alone. ‘Why should he, whom all men worship, worship the High Priest of the Jews?’ ‘Not him,’ replied the king, ‘but the God whose High Priest he is I worship. Long ago, when at Dium in Macedonia, I saw in my dreams such an one in such an attire as this, who urged me to undertake the conquest of Persia and succeed’ … Hand in hand with the High Priest, and with the priestly tribe running by his side, he entered the sacred inclosure, and offered the usual sacrifice, saw with pleasure the indication of the rise of the Grecian power in the prophetic books, granted free use of their ancestral laws, and specially of the year of jubilee inaugurated so solemnly a hundred years before under Nehemiah, promised to befriend the Jewish settlements of Babylonia and Media, and invited any who were disposed to serve in his army with the preservation of their sacred customs.” <span class="ital">Jewish Church</span>, Vol. iii., Lect. xlvii. Without denying that the story is in a legendary dress, we may admit the “probability” of Alexander’s visit to Jerusalem, and the certainty that the city was spared, and the people favoured by him, in accordance with the terms of Zechariah’s prophecy.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/zechariah/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - While the heathen world suffers the judgment of God, he protects his own people. <span class="cmt_word">I will encamp about</span> (<span class="accented">for the protection of</span>) <span class="cmt_word">my house.</span> God's house, or family, is the kingdom and Church of Israel, as <a href="/hosea/8-1.htm">Hosea 8:1</a>.

The phrase, "him that passeth by and him that returneth," is used of an enemy making incursions, or attacking at various points (see note on Zechariah 7:14). The Vulgate gives the whole clause thus: <span class="accented">Circumdabo domum meam ex his, qui militant mihi euntes et revertentes</span>, "I will defend my house with a guard chosen from those who serve me and do my will," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> angels. But this seems far from the signification of the Hebrew. Pusey restricts the meaning to the proceedings of Alexander, who passed by Judaea on his way to Egypt, and returned by the same route, without doing any injury to Jerusalem. Here comes in the Talmudic story related by Josephus ('Ant.,' 11:08). The Jews "repaid the protection of Persia with a devoted loyalty, which prompted them to refuse the demand of submission made by Alexander during the siege of Tyre. He marched to chastise them after the fall of Gaza, and the beautiful city had already risen before his view on the hill of Zion, when he found the high priest Jaddua waiting his approach at the watch station of Sapha, clad in his robes of gold and purple, and followed by a train of priests and citizens in pure white. The conqueror bowed in reverence to the Holy Name upon the high priest's frontlet; and, being asked by Parmenio the reason of his conduct, said that in a dream at Dium, he had seen the God of Jaddua, who encouraged him to pass over into Asia, and promised him success. Then entering Jerusalem, he offered sacrifice in the temple, heard the prophecy of Daniel about himself; and granted certain privileges to all the Jews throughout his empire. The desire to honour a shrine so celebrated as, the Jewish temple is quite in accordance with the conduct of Alexander at Ilium and Ephesus, Gordium and Tyre. The privileges he is said to have conferred upon the Jews were enjoyed under his successors, and some minor matters have been adduced in confirmation of the story. On the other hand, the classical writers are entirely silent on the subject, and the details of Josephus involve grave historical inconsistencies. It seems not an unreasonable conjecture that the story is an embellishment of some incident that occurred when the high priest came to Gaza to tender the submission of the Jews. But we must not dismiss it without a remark on the vast influence which the conquests of Alexander had in bringing the Jews into closer relations with the rest of Asia, and so preparing them to fulfil their ultimate destiny as Christians" (P. Smith, 'History of the World,' 1:60, etc). <span class="cmt_word">Oppressor</span>. The word is used for "taskmaster" in <a href="/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7</a>. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, "one who drives away;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">exactor</span>. This latter rendering would  imply that Israel would no longer have to pay tribute to foreign nations, but should henceforward be independent. <span class="cmt_word">For now have I seen with mine eyes.</span> It is as though, during Israel's calamities, God had not looked upon her; but now he notices her condition, and interposes for her succour (comp. <a href="/exodus/2-25.htm">Exodus 2:25</a>; <a href="/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7, 9</a>; <a href="/acts/7-34.htm">Acts 7:34</a>). This is done by sending the personage mentioned in the following section. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/haggai/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Who is left among you, that saw this house in its former glory? and how do ye see it now? Is it not as nothing in your eyes? <a href="/haggai/2-4.htm">Haggai 2:4</a>. And now be comforted, Zerubbabel, is the saying of Jehovah; and be comforted, Joshua son of Jozadak, thou high priest; and be comforted all the people of the land, is the saying of Jehovah, and work: for I am with you, is the saying of Jehovah of hosts. <a href="/haggai/2-5.htm">Haggai 2:5</a>. The word that I concluded with you at your coming out of Egypt, and my Spirit, stand in the midst of you; fear ye not." The prophet, admitting the poverty of the new building in comparison with the former one, exhorts them to continue the work in comfort, and promises them that the Lord will be with them, and fulfil His covenant promises. The question in <a href="/haggai/2-3.htm">Haggai 2:3</a> is addressed to the old men, who had seen Solomon's temple in all its glory. There might be many such men still living, as it was only sixty-seven or sixty-eight years since the destruction of the first temple. &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1512; is the predicate to the subject &#1502;&#1497;, and has the article because it is defined by the reflex action of the relative clause which follows (compare Ewald, 277, a). The second question, &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492; &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;, et qualem videtis, In what condition do ye see it now? is appended to the last clause of the first question: the house which ye saw in its former glory. There then follows with &#1492;&#1500;&#1493;&#1488;, in the form of a lively assurance, the statement of the difference between the two buildings. &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1503;, which has been interpreted in very different ways, may be explained from the double use of the &#1499; in comparisons, which is common in Hebrew, and which answers to our as - so: here, however, it is used in the same way as in <a href="/genesis/18-25.htm">Genesis 18:25</a> and <a href="/genesis/44-18.htm">Genesis 44:18</a>; that is to say, the object to be compared is mentioned first, and the object with which the comparison is instituted is mentioned afterwards, in this sense, "so is it, as having no existence," in which case we should either leave out the first particle of comparison, or if it were expressed, should have to reverse the order of the words: "as not existing (nothing), so is it in your eyes." Koehler gives this correct explanation; whereas if &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; be explained according to <a href="//biblehub.com/joel/2-2.htm">Joel 2:2</a>, its equal, or such an one, we get the unsuitable thought, that it is not the temple itself, but something like the temple, that is compared to nothing. Even in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/44-18.htm">Genesis 44:18</a>, to which Ewald very properly refers as containing a perfectly equivalent phrase, it is not a man equal to Joseph, but Joseph himself, who is compared to Pharaoh, and described as being equal to him. Nevertheless they are not to let their courage fail, but to be comforted and to work. Cha&#770;zaq, to be inwardly strong, i.e., to be comforted, 'Ash, to work or procure, as in <a href="/ruth/2-19.htm">Ruth 2:19</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/31-13.htm">Proverbs 31:13</a>, in actual fact, to continue the work of building bravely, without there being any necessity to supply &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1499;&#1492; from <a href="/haggai/1-14.htm">Haggai 1:14</a>. For Jehovah will be with them (cf. <a href="/haggai/1-13.htm">Haggai 1:13</a>).<p>In confirmation of this promise the Lord adds, that the word which He concluded with them on their coming out of Egypt, and His Spirit, will continue among them. "The word" ('eth-hadda&#770;bha&#770;r) cannot be either the accusative of the object to the preceding verb &#8219;a&#774;su&#772; (<a href="/haggai/2-4.htm">Haggai 2:4</a>), or to any verb we may choose to supply, or the preposition 'e&#772;th, with, or the accusative of norm or measure (Luther, Calvin, and others). To connect it with &#8219;a&#774;su&#772; yields no suitable meaning. It is not the word, which they vowed to the Lord, at the conclusion of the covenant, that they are to do now, but the work which they had begun, viz., the building of the temple, they are now to continue. It is perfectly arbitrary to supply the verb zikhru&#772;, remember (Ewald and Hengstenberg), and to understand the prophet as reminding them of the word "fear not" (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/20-17.htm">Exodus 20:17-20</a>). That word, "fear not," with which Moses, not God, infused courage into the people, who were alarmed at the terrible phenomenon with which Jehovah came down upon Sinai, has no such central significance as that Haggai could point to it without further introduction, and say that Jehovah had concluded it with them on their coming out of Egypt. The word which the Lord concluded with Israel when He led it out of Egypt, can only be the promise which established the covenant, to the fulfilment of which God bound Himself in relation to the people, when He led them out of Egypt, namely, the word that He would make Israel into His own property out of all nations (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>; cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-22.htm">Jeremiah 7:22-23</a>, and <a href="/jeremiah/11-4.htm">Jeremiah 11:4</a>). It would quite agree with this to take 'e&#772;th as the accusative of the norm, and also to connect it as a preposition, if this could only be shown to be in accordance with the rules of the language. But although the accusative in Hebrew is often used, in the relation of free subordination, "to express more precisely the relation of measure and size, space and time, mode and kind" (cf. Ewald, 204-206), it is impossible to find any example of such an accusative of norm as is here assumed, especially with 'e&#772;th preceding it. But if 'e&#772;th were a preposition instead of &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1499;&#1501;, we should have &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1499;&#1501;, inasmuch as the use of &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;, as a parallel to &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1499;&#1501;, makes the words clumsy and awkward. The thought which Haggai evidently wishes to express requires that hadda&#770;bha&#770;r should stand upon the same line with ru&#772;ch&#305;&#772;, so that 'eth-hadda&#770;bha&#770;r is actually the subject to &#8219;o&#772;medeth, and 'e&#772;th is simply used to connect the new declaration with the preceding one, and to place it in subjection to the one which follows, in the sense of "as regards," quoad (Ewald, 277, d, pp. 683-4), in which case the choice of the accusative in the present instance may either be explained from a kind of attraction (as in the Latin, urbem quam statuo vestra est), as Hitzig supposes, or from the blending together of two constructions, as Koehler maintains; that is to say, Haggai intended to write &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; &#1493;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1497; &#1492;&#1506;&#1502;&#1491;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, but was induced to alter the proposed construction by the relative clause &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; attaching itself to &#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;. Consequently &#8219;o&#772;medeth, as predicate, not only belongs to ru&#772;ch&#305;&#772;, but also to hadda&#770;bha&#770;r, in the sense of to have continuance and validity; and according to a later usage of the language, &#1506;&#1502;&#1491; is used for &#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;, to stand fast (compare <a href="/isaiah/40-8.htm">Isaiah 40:8</a> with <a href="/daniel/11-14.htm">Daniel 11:14</a>). The word, that Israel is the property of Jehovah, and Jehovah the God of Israel, still stands in undiminished force; and not only so, but His Spirit also still works in the midst of Israel. Ru&#772;a&#774;ch, in parallelism with the word containing the foundation of the covenant, is neither the spirit of prophecy (Chald., J. D. Mich.), nor the spirit which once filled Bezaleel and his companions (<a href="/exodus/31-1.htm">Exodus 31:1</a>., <a href="/exodus/36-1.htm">Exodus 36:1</a>.), enabling them to erect the tabernacle in a proper manner, and one well-pleasing to God (Luc., Osiander, and Koehler). Both views are too narrow; ru&#772;a&#774;ch is the divine power which accompanies the word of promise and realizes it in a creative manner, i.e., not merely "the virtue with which God will establish their souls, that they may not be overcome by temptations" (Calvin), but also the power of the Spirit working in the world, which is able to remove all the external obstacles that present themselves to the realization of the divine plan of salvation. This Spirit is still working in Israel ("in the midst of you"); therefore they are not to fear, even if the existing state of things does not correspond to human expectations. The omnipotence of God can and will carry out His word, and glorify His temple. This leads to the further promise in <a href="//biblehub.com/haggai/2-6.htm">Haggai 2:6-9</a>, which gives the reason for the exhortation, "Fear ye not." </body></html>
