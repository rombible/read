That is, the borders of this prophecy. Hamath shall be involved in the calamities which this prophecy denounces. “I suppose,” says Newcome, “that Hamath on the river Orontes is meant.” It was the capital of one part of Syria, and formed, some time, an independent kingdom. See note on <a href="/jeremiah/49-23.htm" title="Concerning Damascus. Hamath is confounded, and Arpad: for they have heard evil tidings: they are fainthearted; there is sorrow on the sea; it cannot be quiet.">Jeremiah 49:23</a>. <span class="ital">Tyrus and Zidon — </span>These cities also, shall be reached by the judgments threatened in this prophecy; <span class="ital">though it be very wise — </span>Although Zidon prides itself so much for its skill and knowledge of things, and puts much confidence in its crafty counsels. Blayney renders the latter clause of this verse and the next, <span class="ital">And Sidon, though she be very wise, and hath built Tyre, a fortress, for herself; and hath heaped up silver as the dust, and fine gold as the mire of the streets. </span>Zidon was the capital of Phenicia, and mother of Tyre. For Justin informs us, (lib. 18. cap. 3,) that the Sidonians, when their city was taken by the king of Ascalon, betook themselves to their ships and built Tyre. Hence Tyre is called the daughter of Sidon, <a href="/isaiah/23-12.htm" title="And he said, You shall no more rejoice, O you oppressed virgin, daughter of Zidon: arise, pass over to Chittim; there also shall you have no rest.">Isaiah 23:12</a>. The Sidonians were famous all over the world for their knowledge and skill in arts and sciences, and for their great riches, acquired by their traffic: see notes on <a href="/isaiah/23-2.htm" title="Be still, you inhabitants of the isle; you whom the merchants of Zidon, that pass over the sea, have replenished.">Isaiah 23:2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/23-4.htm" title="Be you ashamed, O Zidon: for the sea has spoken, even the strength of the sea, saying, I travail not, nor bring forth children, neither do I nourish up young men, nor bring up virgins.">Isaiah 23:4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/23-12.htm" title="And he said, You shall no more rejoice, O you oppressed virgin, daughter of Zidon: arise, pass over to Chittim; there also shall you have no rest.">Isaiah 23:12</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/27-8.htm" title="The inhabitants of Zidon and Arvad were your mariners: your wise men, O Tyrus, that were in you, were your pilots.">Ezekiel 27:8</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/28-2.htm" title="Son of man, say to the prince of Tyrus, Thus said the Lord GOD; Because your heart is lifted up, and you have said, I am a God, I sit in the seat of God, in the middle of the seas; yet you are a man, and not God, though you set your heart as the heart of God:">Ezekiel 28:2</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Behold, the Lord will cast her out — </span>Will cast out her inhabitants. <span class="ital">And he will smite her power in the sea, </span>&c. — The Sidonians, according to Diodorus Siculus, (lib. 16. p. 116;) on the approach of the army sent against them by Ochus, king of Persia, first of all destroyed their shipping at sea; and then retiring within the walls of the city, when they found they could hold out no longer, set fire to their houses, and burned themselves with all their families and effects together. Thus their wealth was effectually smitten, when by burning their ships, their commerce, the source of their riches, was annihilated; and this last act of desperation completely fulfilled the remaining part of the prophecy. No wonder if their neighbours, the Philistines, (as is signified in the next verse,) were struck with consternation at seeing the disastrous fate of those on whose assistance they depended. See Blayney. Probably also the destruction of Tyre by Alexander the Great may be predicted in these verses; of which see the places referred to above. <span class="ital">Ashkelon shall fear; Gaza also be very sorrowful, and Ekron — </span>These cities flattered themselves, that if Tyre could withstand Alexander, they also should be able to escape his hand; but Tyre being taken, all these hopes vanished. Alexander made himself master of Gaza immediately after the taking of Tyre; 10,000 of the inhabitants were slain, and the governor Betis dragged round the city wall till he was dead. <span class="ital">King </span>is a general word for any governor, in Hebrew, as has been before observed. Strabo, speaking of Gaza, lib. 16., says, “It was formerly a city of note, but was destroyed by Alexander the Great.” Or, according to Josephus, having suffered severely, upon being taken by Alexander, it was at length totally ruined and destroyed by Alexander Jannæus, one of the Asmonean kings of Judah. Hence we read, <a href="/acts/8-26.htm" title="And the angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south to the way that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza, which is desert.">Acts 8:26</a>, <span class="ital">Gaza which is desert.

God's house lies in the midst of an enemy's country; his church is as a lily among thorns. God's power and goodness are seen in her special preservation.

"The Syrians, not as yet tamed by the losses of war, despised the new empire, but, swiftly subdued, they did obediently what they were commanded."<p>And Zidon - Zidon, although probably older than Tyre , is here spoken of parenthetically, as subordinate. Perhaps, owing to its situation, it was a wealthy , rather than a strong place. Its name is "Fishing-town;" in Joshua, it is called "the great" <a href="/joshua/11-8.htm">Joshua 11:8</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/19-28.htm">Joshua 19:28</a>, perhaps the metropolis; while Tyre is named from its strength <a href="/joshua/19-29.htm">Joshua 19:29</a>.

In the times of Ezekiel it had become subordinate, furnishing "rowers" <a href="/ezekiel/27-8.htm">Ezekiel 27:8</a> to Tyre; but Esarhaddon, about 80 years before, boasts that he had taken it, destroyed its inhabitants, and re-populated it with people from the East, building a new city which he called by his own name . Tyre too had been taken by Nebuchadnezzar . At the restoration from the captivity, Sidon had the first place, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/3-7.htm">Ezra 3:7</a>, which it retained in the time of Xerxes . But Artaxerxes Ochus gained possession of it by treachery, when all Phoenicia revolted from Persia, and, besides those crucified, 40,000 of its inhabitants perished by their own hands , twenty years before the invasion of Alexander, to whom it submitted willingly .<p>The prophet having named Tyre and Zidon together, yet continues as to Tyre alone, as being alone of account in the days of which he is speaking, those of Alexander.<p>Although - Rather, "because she is very wise." Man's own wisdom is his foolishness and destruction, "as the foolishness of God" is his wisdom and salvation. God "taketh the wise in their own craftiness" <a href="/job/5-13.htm">Job 5:13</a>. "For after that, in the wisdom of God, the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe" <a href="/1_corinthians/1-21.htm">1 Corinthians 1:21</a>. Of the Hagarenes it is said, they "seek wisdom upon earth; none of these know the way of wisdom, or remember her paths" (Baruch 3:23). The wisdom of Tyre was the source of her pride, and so of her destruction also. "Because thy heart is lifted up, and thou hast said, I am a god, I sit in the seat of God, in the midst of the seas; yet thou art a man and not God, though thou hast set thine heart as the heart of God; behold thou art wiser them Daniel, there is no secret that they can hide from thee.

On Alexander's expressing his wish to sacrifice in Hercules' temple in New Tyre on the island, she showed her wisdom in sending a golden crown, and replying that the true and ancient temple of Hercules was at Old Tyre on the mainland.

The Authorized Version probably means that Hamath shall be the companion of Damascus in punishment. (For Hamath, see note on Amos 6:2.) These Syrian towns, as well as those below in Phoenicia and Philistia, shall be visited, because they were all once included in the territory promised to Israel (see <a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>; <a href="/exodus/23-3.htm">Exodus 23:3</a>l; <a href="/numbers/34-2.htm">Numbers 34:2-12</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/11-25.htm">Deuteronomy 11:25</a>; and comp. <a href="/2_samuel/8-6.htm">2 Samuel 8:6</a>, etc.; <a href="/1_kings/4-21.htm">1 Kings 4:21</a>; <a href="/1_kings/8-65.htm">1 Kings 8:65</a>; <a href="/2_kings/14-25.htm">2 Kings 14:25</a>).
