The Jebusites' condition under Solomon being that of bond-servants and tributaries, Calvin explains the verse differently: "I will rescue the Jew from the teeth of the Philistine foe (image from wild beasts rending their prey with their teeth), who would have devoured him, as he would devour blood or flesh of his abominable sacrifices to idols: and even he, the seemingly ignoble remnant of the Jews, shall be sacred to our God (consecrated by His favor); and though so long bereft of dignity, I will make them to be as governors ruling others, and Ekron shall be a tributary bond-servant as the Jebusite?

The Septuagint, Syriac, and Arabic versions, read "their blood"; not the blood of the bastard, but of the Philistines. The Targum is, "I will destroy them that eat blood"; the meaning may be, that they shall no more thirst after blood, nor drink it; nor breathe out threatenings and slaughter against the saints, or persecute the people of God: or that they should no more offer the blood of their sacrifices upon the altars to their deities, or eat things sacrificed to them: <p>and his abominations from between his teeth; their idols and idolatries they were tenacious of, as a man is of his food, or of any thing that is grateful to him; it may design things sacrificed to idols, eaten by them: <p>but he that remaineth, even he shall be for our God: the Targum paraphrases it, <p>"and the proselytes that remain among them, they also shall be added to the people of our God:'' <p>Jarchi interprets it of the synagogues and schools in the captivity of Edom or Rome; but Aben Ezra's note is much better, that there shall be none remaining of the Philistines, but only such who serve the blessed God openly: but the true sense is, that here should be a remnant, according to the election of grace, who should evidently appear to be the Lord's people, by their conversion and effectual calling: <p>and he shall be as a governor in Judah; the Targum is, <p>"they shall be as the princes of the house of Judah;'' <p>that is, as the heads of the families in that tribe; see <a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a> compared with <a href="/matthew/2-6.htm">Matthew 2:6</a> all true Christians are as princes, yea, they are kings and priests unto God; and some of them are  as a guide, teacher; and instructor of others; who go before them, and instruct them in the doctrines of the Gospel, as pastors and ministers of the word: <p>and Ekron as a Jebusite; that is, the inhabitant of Ekron, that shall be converted to Christ, shall be as an inhabitant of Jerusalem, which was called Jebus, <a href="/1_chronicles/11-4.htm">1 Chronicles 11:4</a> shall have a dwelling in the church, the city of God, and enjoy all the privileges and immunities of it.

According to Calvin the Philistine, the nation personified, is here compared to a wild beast from whose jaws the prey which he is devouring is torn. “Abominationes enim intelligit quicquid injusta violentia ad se traxerant. Et comparat eos feris bestiis, quæ non modum carnem devorant, sed etiam hauriunt sanguinem ipsum, et lacerant crudas carnes.” The objection to this interpretation is that the word rendered “abominations” can hardly refer to the victims or the spoils of the cruelty or rapacity of the Philistine. It is a word of frequent occurrence in the O. T. and is used almost always (<a href="/nahum/3-6.htm" title="And I will cast abominable filth on you, and make you vile, and will set you as a spectacle.">Nahum 3:6</a>, “abominable filth,” is an exception) of “idols in that they were abominations.” (Comp. <a href="/1_kings/11-5.htm" title="For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.">1 Kings 11:5</a>; <a href="/1_kings/11-7.htm" title="Then did Solomon build an high place for Chemosh, the abomination of Moab, in the hill that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech, the abomination of the children of Ammon.">1 Kings 11:7</a>; <a href="/2_kings/23-13.htm" title="And the high places that were before Jerusalem, which were on the right hand of the mount of corruption, which Solomon the king of Israel had built for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Zidonians, and for Chemosh the abomination of the Moabites, and for Milcom the abomination of the children of Ammon, did the king defile.">2 Kings 23:13</a>; and <a href="/daniel/11-31.htm" title="And arms shall stand on his part, and they shall pollute the sanctuary of strength, and shall take away the daily sacrifice, and they shall place the abomination that makes desolate.">Daniel 11:31</a> with <a href="/matthew/24-15.htm" title="When you therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoever reads, let him understand:)">Matthew 24:15</a>, <span class="greekheb">τὸ βδέλυγμα τῆς ἐρημώσεως</span>). It is probably best therefore, with the majority of modern commentators, to understand the reference to be to idolatrous sacrifices eaten by the worshippers with the blood.

So should it be with the Philistines, who are here intended by Ekron. They too shall be absorbed into the Jewish church and nation, when the ultimate goal of the prophecy is reached.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/zechariah/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - Personifying Philistia, the prophet declares that she shall cease to practise idolatry, and shall be incorporated in Israel. <span class="cmt_word">I will take away his blood out of his mouth.</span> This refers to the practice of drinking the blood of sacrifices as an act of worship, or of eating the victims with the blood - a practice strictly forbidden to the Israelites (see <a href="/leviticus/3-17.htm">Leviticus 3:17</a>; <a href="/leviticus/7-26.htm">Leviticus 7:26</a>; <a href="/leviticus/17-10.htm">Leviticus 17:10, 12</a>; and comp. <a href="/genesis/9-4.htm">Genesis 9:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Abominations</span>. Sacrifices offered to idols, and afterwards eaten. The two clauses intimate the entire abolition of idolatry. Many see in this prediction a reference to the doings of the Maccabees; how, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, Judas destroyed the altars and idols in Azotus (1 Macc. 5:68); Jonathan again took that city, and burned it and the neighbouring towns, and, besieging Ashkelon, was received with great honour by the inhabitants, and confirmed in the possession of this place and Ekron (1 Macc. 10:84, etc.); and Simon stormed Gaza (? Gazara, a place near Ashdod), cleansed the houses of idols, "put all uncleanness out of it, and placed such men there as would keep the Law" (1 Macc. 13:47, 48). But though such events partially fulfil the prophecy, the seer looks forward to a greater issue, and in these comparatively petty details beholds the working of the great principle that all nations shall be subdued to the faith. <span class="cmt_word">He that remaineth,</span> <span class="cmt_word">even he, shall be for our God;</span> better, <span class="accented">he too shall be left</span> (or, <span class="accented">a remnant</span>) <span class="accented">for our God.</span> The Philistine shall become a choice and elect remnant unto the God of the Israelites, and no longer regarded as alien and impure. <span class="cmt_word">As a governor;</span> Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "head over a thousand." which the word <span class="accented">alluph</span>  means (<a href="/zechariah/12-5.htm">Zechariah 12:5, 6</a>). It is used of the chiefs of Edom in <a href="/genesis/36-15.htm">Genesis 36:15, 16</a>, etc., where the Authorized Version gives "dukes." The tribes of Israel were divided into thousands, consisting of families, each of which was held together by closer affinities than the mere tribal bond (see note on Micah 5:2). The meaning is that the Philistine shall be admitted into the commonwealth of Israel as one of her chiefs. <span class="cmt_word">Ekron as a Jebusite.</span> "Ekron" is equivalent to "the Ekronite," who again stands in the place of all the Philistines. The Jebusites were the ancient possessors of Zion, who held their position till the days of David, and, when at last conquered by him (<a href="/2_samuel/5-6.htm">2 Samuel 5:6</a>, etc.), were incorporated into his nation, and, as we may infer from Araunah's conduct, adopted his religion (<a href="/2_samuel/24-22.htm">2 Samuel 24:22</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/21-23.htm">1 Chronicles 21:23</a>). God promises here that the Philistines, like the Jebusites, shall be absorbed into the Jewish Church. Mr. Drake ('Speaker's Commentary,' <span class="accented">in loc.</span>) curiously renders, "He shall be as Eleph (<a href="/joshua/18-28.htm">Joshua 18:28</a>) in Judah, and Ekron as Jebusi," explaining that the cities of Philistia were to be incorporated into Judaea. The conquests of Alexander conduced to the conversion of the heathen and their reception into the Church of God; and the general principle enunciated by all the prophets was tiros abundantly confirmed. But it is rot easy to discover the exact historical fulfilment of the latter part of this prophecy, concerning the merging of the Philistines in the Jewish nation. Josephus ('Ant.,' 13:15. 4) tells us that, about  <span class="date">B.C. 100</span>, the Jews held most of their cities, destroying some whose inhabitants refused to become proselytes. In the time of our Lord, by reason of intermarriage and social intercourse, the Philistines had ceased to be regarded as a separate nation; and a little later Philistia, far from being considered as alien and hostile, under the form Palestine, gave its name to the whole country. Christianity, too, made rapid progress in this district, so that the psalmist's words received herein a fulfilment, "Behold Philistia, and Tyre, with Gush; this one was born there" (<a href="/psalms/87-4.htm">Psalm 87:4</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/haggai/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Glory of the New Temple- <a href="/haggai/2-1.htm">Haggai 2:1</a> and <a href="/haggai/2-2.htm">Haggai 2:2</a>. "In the seventh month, on the twenty-first day of the month, the word of the Lord came through Haggai," viz., to Zerubbabel, Joshua, and the remnant of the nation, that is to say, to the whole of the congregation that had returned from exile; whereas the first appeal was only addressed to Zerubbabel and Joshua (see the introduction to <a href="/haggai/1-1.htm">Haggai 1:1</a>), although it also applied to the whole nation. Just as in the second year of the return from Babylon, when the foundation for the temple, which was about to be rebuilt, was laid in the reign of Cyrus, many old men, who had seen the temple of Solomon, burst out into loud weeping when they saw the new foundation (<a href="/ezra/3-10.htm">Ezra 3:10</a>.); a similar feeling of mourning and despair appears to have taken possession of the people and their rulers immediately after the work had been resumed under Darius, and doubts arose whether the new building was really well-pleasing to the Lord, and ought to be carried on. The occasion for this despondency is not to be sought, as Hitzig supposes, in the fact that objections were made to the continuance of the building (<a href="/ezra/5-3.htm">Ezra 5:3</a>), and that the opinion prevailed in consequence that the works ought to be stopped till the arrival of the king's authority. For this view not only has no support whatever in our prophecy, but is also at variance with the account in the book of Ezra, according to which the governor and his companions, who had made inquiries concerning the command to build, did not stop the building while they sent word of the affair to the king (<a href="/ezra/5-5.htm">Ezra 5:5</a>). Moreover, the conjecture that the people had been seized with a feeling of sadness, when the work had so far advanced that they were able to institute a comparison between the new temple and the earlier one (Hengstenberg), does not suffice to explain the rapid alteration which took place in the feelings of the people. The building could not have been so far advance din three weeks and a half as that the contrast between the new temple and the former one could be clearly seen, if it had not been noticed from the very first; a fact, however, to which <a href="/ezra/3-12.htm">Ezra 3:12</a> distinctly refers. But although it had been seen from the very beginning that the new building would not come up to the glory of the former temple, the people could not from the very outset give up the hope of erecting a building which, if not quite equal to the former one in glory, would at all events come somewhat near to it. Under these circumstances, their confidence in the work might begin to vanish as soon as the first enthusiasm flagged, and a time arrived which was more favourable for the quiet contemplation of the general condition of affairs. This explanation is suggested by the time at which the second word of God was delivered to the congregation through the prophet. The twenty-first day of the seventh month was the seventh day of the feast of tabernacles (cf. <a href="/leviticus/23-34.htm">Leviticus 23:34</a>.), the great festival of rejoicing, on which Israel was to give practical expression to its gratitude for the gracious guidance which it had received through the wilderness, as well as for the blessing of the ingathering of all the fruits of the ground, which ended with the gathering of the orchard-fruits and with the vintage, by the presentation of numerous burnt-offerings and other sacrifices (see my biblische Archologie, i. p. 415ff.). The return of this festal celebration, especially after a harvest which had turned out very miserably, and showed no signs of the blessing of God, could not fail to call up vividly before the mind the difference between the former times, when Israel was able to assemble in the courts of the Lord's house, and so to rejoice in the blessings of His grace in the midst of abundant sacrificial meals, and the present time, when the altar of burnt-sacrifice might indeed be restored again, and the building of the temple be resumed, but in which there was no prospect of erecting a building that would in any degree answer to the glory of the former temple; and when the prophecies of an Isaiah or an Ezekiel were remembered, according to which the new temple was to surpass the former one in glory, it would be almost sure to produce gloomy thoughts, and supply food for doubt whether the time had really come for rebuilding the temple, when after all it would be only a miserable hut. In this gloomy state of mind consolation was very necessary, if the hardly awakened zeal for the building of the house of God was not to cool down and vanish entirely away. To bring this consolation to those who were in despair was the object of the second word of God, which Haggai was to publish to the congregation. It runs as follows: </body></html>
