While the Macedonians and Alexander's successors were in warfare in these countries, the Lord promised to protect his people. God's house lies in the midst of an enemy's country; his church is as a lily among thorns. God's power and goodness are seen in her special preservation. The Lord encamps about his church, and while armies of proud opposers shall pass by and return, his eyes watch over her, so that they cannot prevail, and shortly the time will come when no exactor shall pass by her any more.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/zechariah/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The burden - o of the word of the Lord in (or, upon)  the land of Hadrach The foreground of this prophecy is the course of the Victories of Alexander, which circled round the holy land without hurting it, and ended in the overthrow of the Persian empire. The surrender of Damascus followed first, immediately on his great victory at the Issus; then Sidon yielded itself and received its ruler from the conqueror, Tyre he utterly destroyed; Gaza, we know, perished; he passed harmless by Jerusalem. Samaria, on his return from Egypt, he chastised.<p>It is now certain that there was a city called Hadrach in the neighborhood of Damascus and Hamath, although its exact site is not known. "It was first found upon the geographical tablets  among the Assyrian inscriptions."  "In the catalogue of Syrian cities, tributary to Nineveh, (of which we have several copies in a more or less perfect state, and varying from each other, both in arrangement and extent) there are three names, which are uniformly grouped together and which we read Manatsuah, Magida (Megiddo) and Du'ar (Dor). As these names are associated with those of Samaria, Damascus, Arpad, Hamath, Carchemish, Hadrach, Zobah, there can be no doubt of the position of the cities" . In the Assyrian Canon, Hadrach is the object of three Assyrian expeditions , 9183 (b.c. 818), 9190 (811) and 9200 (801). The first of these follows upon one against Damascus, 9182 (817). In the wars of Tiglath-pileser II.((the Tiglath-pileser of Holy Scripture,) it has been twice deciphered;<p>(1) In the war b.c. 738, 737, after the mention of "the cities to Saua the mountain which is in Lebanon were divided, the land of Bahalzephon to Ammana" (Ammon), there follows Hadrach ; and subsequently there are mentioned as joined to the league, "19 districts of Hamath, and the cities which were round them, which are beside the sea of the setting sun."<p>(2) In his "War in Palestine and Arabia" , "the city of Hadrach to the land of Saua," and six other cities are enumerated, as "the cities beside the upper sea," which, he says, "I possessed, and six of my generals as governors over them I appointed." No other authority nearly approaches these times. The nearest authority is of the second century after our Lord, 116 a.d. : "R. Jose, born of a Damascene mother, said," answering R. Yehudah ben Elai, , "I call heaven and earth to witness upon me, that I am of Damascus, and that there is a place called Hadrach." Cyril of Alexandria says  that "the land of Hadrach must be somewhere in the eastern parts, and near to Emath (now Epiphania of Antioch) a little further than Damascus, the metropolis of the Phoenicians and Palestine." A writer of the 10th century  says that there was "a very beautiful mosque there, called the Mesjed-el-Khadra, and that the town was named from it." The conjecture that Hadrach might be the name of a king , or an idol , will now probably be abandoned, nor can the idea, (which before seemed the most probable and which was very old), that it was a symbolic name, hold any longer.<p>For the prophets do use symbolic names ; but then they are names which they themselves frame. Micah again selects several names of towns, now almost unknown and probably unimportant, in order to impress upon his people some meaning connected with them , but then he does himself so connect it. He does not name it (so to say), leaving it to explain itself. The name Hadrach  would be a real name, used symbolically, without anything in the context to show that it is a symbol.<p>The cities, upon which the burden or heavy prophecy tell, possessed no interest for Israel. Damascus was no longer a hostile power; Hamath had ever been peaceable, and was far away; Tyre and Sidon did not now carry on a trade in Jewish captives. But the Jews knew from Daniel, that the empire, to which they were in subjection, would be overthrown by Greece <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/8-20.htm">Daniel 8:20-21</a>. When that rapid attack should come, it would be a great consolation to them to know, how they themselves would fare. It was a turning point in their history and the history of the then known world. The prophet describes (see below at <a href="/zechariah/9-8.htm">Zechariah 9:8</a>) the circuit, which the conqueror would take around the land which God defended; how the thunder-cloud circled round Judaea, broke irresistibly upon cities more powerful than Jerusalem, but was turned aside from the holy city "in going and returning," because God encamped around it.<p> "The selection of the places and of the whole line of country corresponds very exactly to the march of Alexander after the battle of Issus, when Damascus, which Darius had chosen as the strong depository of his wealth, of Persian women of rank, confidential officers and envoys, , was betrayed, but so opened its gates to his general, Parmenio. Zidon, a city renowned for its antiquity and its founders, surrendered freely; Tyre, here specially marked out, was taken after a 7 months' siege; Gaza too resisted for 5 months, was taken, and, as it was said, 'plucked up.'" <p>And Damascus shall be the rest thereof - God's judgment fell first upon Damascus. But the word "resting-place" is commonly used of quiet peaceful resting, especially as given by God to Israel; of the ark, the token of the Presence of God, after its manifold removals, and of the glorious dwelling-place of the Christ among people . The prophet seems then purposely to have chosen a word of large meaning, which should at once express (as he had before) <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/6-8.htm">Zechariah 6:8</a>, that the word of God should fall heavily on Damascus and yet be its resting-place. Hence, about the time of our Lord, the Jews interpreted this of the coming of the Messiah, that  "Jerusalem should reach to the gates of Damascus. Since Damascus shall be the place of His rest, but the place of His rest is only the house of the sanctuary, as it is said, "This is My rest for ever; here will I dwell." Another added, , "All the prophets and all prophesied but of the years of redemption and the days of the Messiah." Damascus, on the conversion of Paul, became the first resting-place of the word of God, the first-fruits of the Gentiles whom the Apostle of the Gentiles gathered from east to west throughout the world.<p>When (or For) the eyes of man - As (literally, and that is, especially beyond others) "of all the tribes of Israel, shall be toward the Lord." This also implies a conversion of Gentiles, as well as Jews. For man, as contrasted with Israel, must be the pagan world, mankind . "The eyes of all must needs look in adoration to God, expecting all good from Him, because the Creator of all provided for the well-being of all, as the Apostle says, "Is He the God of the Jews only? Is He not also of the Gentiles? Yea, of the Gentiles also" <a href="/romans/3-29.htm">Romans 3:29</a>. God's time of delivering His people is, when they pray to Him. So Jehoshaphat prayed, "O our God, wilt Thou not judge them? For we have no strength against this great company, which is come against us, and we know not what we shall do; but our eyes are on Thee" <a href="/2_chronicles/20-12.htm">2 Chronicles 20:12</a>; and the Psalmist says, "The eyes of all wait toward Thee; and, "toward them that fear Him." <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/33-18.htm">Psalm 33:18</a>, or in Ezra's Chaldee, "The eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews" <a href="/ezra/5-5.htm">Ezra 5:5</a>., or, "the eyes of the Lord thy God are upon it" (the land), <a href="/deuteronomy/11-12.htm">Deuteronomy 11:12</a>; but there is no construction like "the Lord hath an eye on (obj.) man" (as 70: Jonathan, Syr.) The passages, "whose eyes are opened upon all the ways of the sons of men, to give etc." <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-19.htm">Jeremiah 32:19</a>, "his eyes behold the nations," are altogether different. "The eye of" must be construed as "his own eye.") "as the eyes of servants are unto the hand of their masters, add as the eyes of a maiden are unto the hand of her mistress, so our eyes are unto the Lord our God, until He have mercy upon us."<p>"For in those days," says a Jew, who represents the traditional interpretation, (Rashi), man shall look to his Creator, and his eyes shall look to the Blessed One, as it was said above, we will go with you, and they shall join themselves, they and their cities, to the cities of Israel." And another; (Kimchi), "In those days the eyes of all mankind shall be to the Lord, not to idols or images; therefore the land of Hadrach and Damascus, and the other places near the land of Israel - shall be included among the cities of Judah, and shall be in the faith of Israel." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/zechariah/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 9<p>Zec 9:1-17.

Maurer, not so well, explains it, What is taken up and uttered, the utterance, a solemn declaration.<p>Hadrach&#8212;a part of Syria, near Damascus. As the name is not mentioned in ancient histories, it probably was the less-used name of a region having two names ("Hadrach" and "Bikathaven," Am 1:5, Margin); hence it passed into oblivion. An ancient Rabbi Jose is, however, stated to have expressly mentioned it. An Arab, Jos. Abassi, in 1768 also declared to Michaelis that there was then a town of that name, and that it was capital of the region Hadrach. The name means "enclosed" in Syrian, that is, the west interior part of Syria, enclosed by hills, the Cœlo-Syria of Strabo [Maurer]. Jerome considers Hadrach to be the metropolis of Cœlo-Syria, as Damascus was of the region about that city. Hengstenberg regards Hadrach as a symbolical name of Persia, which Zechariah avoids designating by its proper name so as not to offend the government under which he lived. But the context seems to refer to the Syrian region. Gesenius thinks that the name is that of a Syrian king, which might more easily pass into oblivion than that of a region. Compare the similar "land of Sihon," Ne 9:22.<p>Damascus &#8230; rest thereof&#8212;that is, the place on which the "burden" of the Lord's wrath shall rest.

Typical of the effect of God's judgments hereafter on all men, and especially on the Jews in turning them to Him. Maurer, Pembellus and others, less probably translate, "The eyes of the Lord are upon man, as they are upon all Israel," namely, to punish the ungodly and to protect His people. He, who has chastised His people, will not fail to punish men for their sins severely. The "all," I think, implies that whereas men's attention generally (whence "man" is the expression) was directed to Jehovah's judgments, all Israel especially looks to Him.Amidst the judgments of the neighbouring nations God will defend his church, <span class="bld"><a href="/context/zechariah/9-1.htm" title="The burden of the word of the LORD in the land of Hadrach, and Damascus shall be the rest thereof: when the eyes of man, as of all the tribes of Israel, shall be toward the LORD....">Zechariah 9:1-8</a></span>.

Jose (x), <p>"I am of Damascus, and I call heaven and earth to witness that there is a place there, the name of which is Hadrach.'' <p>Hillerus (y) takes it to be the same with Coelesyria, or hollow Syria, a vale which lay between Libanus and Antilibanus, and goes by many names; the same that is called Hoba, <a href="/genesis/14-15.htm">Genesis 14:15</a> the plain of Aren, and the house of Eden, <a href="/amos/1-5.htm">Amos 1:5</a> and here Hadrach; and thinks it had its name from Hadar, a son of Ishmael, <a href="/genesis/25-15.htm">Genesis 25:15</a> and observes what is said, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/25-18.htm">Genesis 25:18</a>, that the "Ishmaelites dwelt from Havilah", which is to the south of Palestine, "unto Shur", a town situated over against Egypt, "as you go to Assyria"; that is, to the Agra of Ptolemy in Susiana. The Targum renders it <p>"in the land of the south.'' <p>There was a city in Coelesyria, called Adra by Ptolemy (z); which, as Jerom says (a), was distant from Bostra twenty five miles; since called the city of Bernard de Stampis; where were Christian churches in the fourth and fifth centuries, whose bishops were present at councils held in those times (b); and, according to this prophecy, here the word of the Lord was to be published; and it may have respect to the conversion of the inhabitants of it in future times: though some take it to be not the proper name of a place, but an appellative, and render it, "the land about", or "the land about thee" (c); that is, about Judea; the nations round about it, particularly Syria, Phoenicia, and Palestine. <p>And Damascus shall be the rest thereof; either of the Lord himself; his glorious Shechinah shall rest there, as Kimchi interprets it; and so the Targum paraphrases it, <p>"and Damascus shall be converted, that it may be of the house of his Shechinah;'' <p>see <a href="/isaiah/11-10.htm">Isaiah 11:10</a> or of the word of the Lord, which should be declared and published there, as it was by the Apostle Paul, who was converted near it, and preached in it, <a href="/acts/9-3.htm">Acts 9:3</a> or of Hadrach, or the adjacent country: unless it is to be understood of the burden of the Lord resting on it, or of the taking of this city in the times of Alexander the great; which, with the destruction of the cities after mentioned, some make a type or symbol of the abolition of Paganism in the Roman empire; but the former sense seems best. <p>When the eyes of man, as of all the tribes of Israel, shall be towards the Lord; or, "when the eyes of men shall be to the Lord, and to all the tribes of Israel"; so Kimchi and Ben Melech; that is, as they interpret it, when the eyes of all men shall be to the Lord, and not to their idols; and also to all the tribes of Israel, to go along with them in their ways; as it is said above <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/8-23.htm">Zechariah 8:23</a>, "we will go with you": or they shall look to the Lord, even as the tribes of Israel themselves do; and which is true of sinners when converted, whether Jews or Gentiles; and particularly was true of that great man, the Apostle Paul, who was converted near Damascus, when the eyes of his understanding being enlightened, and he seeing the insufficiency of all other objects, looked to the Lord alone for pardon, righteousness, life, and salvation; even as all true Israelites do, who are after the Spirit, and not after the flesh. Though some understand these words of the eyes of the Lord being upon every man, as well as upon the tribes of Israel; upon wicked men to punish them, as upon his people to protect and defend them: and to this sense the Targum inclines, paraphrasing the words thus, <p>"for before the Lord are manifest the works of the children of men, and he is well pleased with all the tribes of Israel.'' <p>(u)  "prolatio verbi Jehovae", Cocceius.

If we translate <span class="ital">burden</span>, it will mean the heavy judgment of Jehovah. In favour of this is the fact that the word is almost always used (<a href="/zechariah/12-1.htm" title="The burden of the word of the LORD for Israel, said the LORD, which stretches forth the heavens, and lays the foundation of the earth, and forms the spirit of man within him.">Zechariah 12:1</a>; <a href="/malachi/1-1.htm" title="The burden of the word of the LORD to Israel by Malachi.">Malachi 1:1</a>, are referred to as exceptions, but the second of these passages can hardly be called so) to introduce a prophecy of judgment. “The sentence issued against an individual or a community hung as a heavy weight, which at last dragged them down.” (<span class="ital">Speak.

On the other hand, from the use of the cognate verb in the sense of “taking up,” i.e. “uttering,” a word or speech (as, “thou shalt not take up the name of Jehovah, thy God, in vain,” <a href="/exodus/20-7.htm" title="You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that takes his name in vain.">Exodus 20:7</a>; “He took up his parable,” <a href="/numbers/23-18.htm" title="And he took up his parable, and said, Rise up, Balak, and hear; listen to me, you son of Zippor:">Numbers 23:18</a>), many prefer to render <span class="ital">utterance</span>, or <span class="ital">oracle</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in the land</span>] <span class="ital">upon the land</span>, R. V.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Hadrach</span>] This word, which occurs nowhere else in the O. T., caused, till recently, much perplexity to commentators. Some of them explained it to be the name of a king, others of an idol, while others regarded it as a symbolical name composed by the prophet. The question, however, as to the meaning of the word appears to have been satisfactorily set at rest, by its being discovered in the Assyrian inscriptions “in the catalogue of Syrian cities tributary to Nineveh.” Sir H. Rawlinson, quoted by Pusey, says, “It is now certain that there was a city called Hadrach in the neighbourhood of Damascus and Hamath, although its exact site is not known … In the Assyrian Canon Hadrach is the object of three Assyrian expeditions.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the rest thereof</span>] Or, <span class="ital">its resting place</span>, R.

V. This has been explained as implying “a conversion of Gentiles, as well as Jews. For <span class="ital">man</span>, as contrasted with Israel, must be the heathen world, mankind. ‘The eyes of all must needs look in adoration to God, expecting all good from Him, because the Creator of all provided for the well-being of all.’ ” Pusey. Or, since the context, which is minatory in tone, seems not to admit of this interpretation, the words have been thus paraphrased: “When the fulfilment of the oracles takes place upon Hadrach and Damascus, and the wrath of God descends upon those cities and districts, the eyes of the nations as well as those of the people of Israel will look towards Jehovah, and marvel at the wonders of judgment which will then be performed in their sight in accordance with the solemn warnings of the prophet.” Rev.

(On the circumstances connected with this prophecy, see Introduction, &sect; I.)

But Assyrian inscriptions have cleared away the difficulty, and shown that it was the name of a city and district near Damascus, called in the monuments <span class="accented">Hatarakha</span> or <span class="accented">Hatarika</span> (see Schrader, 'Keilinschr. und das Alt. Test,' p. 453). Expeditions against this place are mentioned as occurring in various years, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>  <span class="date">B.C. 772</span>. 765, 755 (see G. Smith, 'Assyrian Canon,' pp. 46, etc., 63; 'Records of the Past,' 5:46; Schrader, pp. 482, 484, etc., 2nd edit.). <span class="cmt_word">Damascus shall be the rest thereof.</span> The "burden" shall light upon Damascus in wrath, and settle there (comp. <a href="/ezekiel/5-13.htm">Ezekiel 5:13</a>). This district should be the first to suffer. The LXX. has, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x394;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, "In the land of Sedrach and Damascus is his sacrifice." <span class="cmt_word">When the eyes of man,</span> etc.; literally, <span class="accented">for to Jehovah</span> (<span class="accented">is</span>, or <span class="accented">will be</span>) <span class="accented">the eye of man and of all the tribes of Israel.</span> This gives the reason why Hadrach and Damascus are thus united. Because Jehovah has his eye on men and on Israel. Septuagint, "because the Lord looketh upon men" (comp. <a href="/zechariah/4-10.htm">Zechariah 4:10</a>; and ver. 8 below). We may then translate, "For to Jehovah is an eye over man," etc. He sees their evil doings and their oppression of Israel, and therefore the judgment falls upon them (comp. <a href="/jeremiah/32-19.htm">Jeremiah 32:19</a>). The Authorized Version intimates a conversion of the Gentiles, of which, however, the context says nothing: and there is no sense in saying that judgment shall fall upon a particular nation when, or because, the eyes of all men look to the Lord. Wright explains thus: When the wrath of God falls on Damascus, the eyes of the heathen, as well as those of Israel, will look to the Lord, and they will marvel at the judgment and the close fulfilment of the prediction. This would be a very sound and probable exposition of the passage if the expression, "the eye of man being towards Jehovah," can mean that man marvels at his doings. <span class="cmt_word">All the tribes of Israel.</span> God watches over them to guard them from evil (<a href="/deuteronomy/11-12.htm">Deuteronomy 11:12</a>; <a href="/ezra/5-5.htm">Ezra 5:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/33-18.htm">Psalm 33:18</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/haggai/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Ye looked out for much, and behold (it came) to little; and ye brought it home, and I blew into it. Why? is the saying of Jehovah of hosts. Because of my house, that it lies waste, whereas ye run every man for his house. <a href="/haggai/1-10.htm">Haggai 1:10</a>. Therefore the heaven has withheld its dew on your account, that no dew fell, and the earth has withheld her produce. <a href="/haggai/1-11.htm">Haggai 1:11</a>. And I called drought upon the earth, and upon the mountains, and upon the corn, and upon the new wine, and upon the oil, and upon everything that the ground produces, and upon men, and upon cattle, and upon all the labour of the hands." The meaning of <a href="/haggai/1-9.htm">Haggai 1:9</a> is evident from the context. The inf. abs. pa&#770;no&#772;h stands in an address full of emotion in the place of the perfect, and, as the following clause shows, for the second person plural. Ye have turned yourselves, fixed your eye upon much, i.e., upon a rich harvest, &#1493;&#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;&#1470;&#1500;&#1502;&#1506;&#1496;, and behold the desired much turned to little. Ye brought into the house, ye fetched home what was reaped, and I blew into it, i.e., I caused it to fly away, like chaff before the wind, so that there was soon none of it left. Here is a double curse, therefore, as in <a href="/haggai/1-6.htm">Haggai 1:6</a> : instead of much, but little was reaped, and the little that was brought home melted away without doing any good. To this exposition of the curse the prophet appends the question &#1497;&#1506;&#1503; &#1502;&#1492;, why, sc. has this taken place? that he may impress the cause with the greater emphasis upon their hardened minds. For the same reason he inserts once more, between the question and the answer, the words "is the saying of Jehovah of hosts," that the answer may not be mistaken for a subjective view, but laid to heart as a declaration of the God who rules the world. The choice of the form &#1502;&#1492; for &#1502;&#1492; was probably occasioned by the guttural &#1506; in the &#1497;&#1506;&#1503;, which is closely connected with it, just as the analogous use of &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1502;&#1492; instead of &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1502;&#1492; in <a href="/isaiah/1-5.htm">Isaiah 1:5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/10-13.htm">Psalm 10:13</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-10.htm">Jeremiah 16:10</a>, where it is not followed by a word commencing with &#1506; as in <a href="/deuteronomy/29-23.htm">Deuteronomy 29:23</a>; <a href="/1_kings/9-8.htm">1 Kings 9:8</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/22-8.htm">Jeremiah 22:8</a>. The former have not been taken into account at all by Ewald in his elaborate Lehrbuch (cf. 182, b). In the answer given by God, "because of my house" (ya&#8219;an be&#772;th&#305;&#772;) is placed first for the sake of emphasis, and the more precise explanation follows. &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;, "because it," not "that which." &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; is a circumstantial clause. &#1500;&#1489;&#1497;&#1514;&#1493; ... &#1512;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501;, not "every one runs to his house," but "runs for his house," &#1500; denoting the object of the running, as in <a href="/isaiah/59-7.htm">Isaiah 59:7</a> and <a href="/proverbs/1-16.htm">Proverbs 1:16</a>. "When the house of Jehovah was in question, they did not move from the spot; but if it concerned their own house, they ran" (Koehler). In <a href="/haggai/1-10.htm">Haggai 1:10</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/haggai/1-11.htm">Haggai 1:11</a>, the curse with which God punished the neglect of His house is still further depicted, with an evident play upon the punishment with which transgressors are threatened in the law (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/26-19.htm">Leviticus 26:19-20</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/11-17.htm">Deuteronomy 11:17</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-23.htm">Deuteronomy 28:23-24</a>). &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501; is not a dat. incomm. (Hitzig), which is never expressed by &#1506;&#1500;; but &#1506;&#1500; is used either in a causal sense, "on your account" (Chald.), or in a local sense, "over you," after the analogy of <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-23.htm">Deuteronomy 28:23</a>, &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1498; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1506;&#1500; &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498;, in the sense of "the heaven over you will withold" (Ros., Koehl.). It is impossible to decide with certainty between these two. The objection to the first, that "on your account" would be superfluous after &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1503;, has no more force than that raised by Hitzig against the second, viz., that super would be &#1502;&#1506;&#1500;. There is no tautology in the first explanation, but the &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501;, written emphatically at the commencement, gives greater intensity to the threat: "on account of you," you who only care for your own houses, the heaven witholds the dew. And with the other explanation, &#1502;&#1506;&#1500; would only be required in case &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501; were regarded as the object, upon which the dew ought to fall down from above. &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;, not "to shut itself up," but in a transitive sense, with the derivative meaning to withhold or keep back; and mitta&#770;l, not partitively "of the dew," equivalent to "a portion of it," but min in a privative sense, "away from," i.e., so that no dew falls; for it is inadmissible to take mitta&#770;l as the object, "to hold back along with the dew," after the analogy of <a href="/numbers/24-11.htm">Numbers 24:11</a> (Hitzig), inasmuch as the accusative of the person is wanting, and in the parallel clause &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488; is construed with the accus. rei. &#1493;&#1488;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488; in <a href="/haggai/1-11.htm">Haggai 1:11</a> is still dependent upon &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1503;. The word cho&#772;rebh, in the sense of drought, applies strictly speaking only to the land and the fruits of the ground, but it is also transferred to men and beasts, inasmuch as drought, when it comes upon all vegetation, affects men and beasts as well; and in this clause it may be taken in the general sense of devastation. The word is carefully chosen, to express the idea of the lex talionis. Because the Jews left the house of God cha&#770;re&#772;bh, they were punished with cho&#772;rebh. The last words are comprehensive: "all the labour of the hands" had reference to the cultivation of the soil and the preparation of the necessities of life. </body></html>
