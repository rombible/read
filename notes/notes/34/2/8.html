(<span class= "ital">mêymeyhâ</span> for <span class= "ital">mîmêy hî,</span> and to render, <span class= "ital">And Nineveh, like a pool of water are her waters, and they</span> [her inhabitants] <span class= "ital">are fleeing away.</span> The waters which formerly flowed in river-courses and dykes are now one vast expanse of inundation. A panic thereupon seizes the inhabitants. If the present text be maintained, the rendering of the Authorised Version will stand. We may then suppose the heterogeneous population of Nineveh to be compared to “countless drops, full, untroubled, with no ebb or flow, fenced in from the days that she hath been, yet even therefore stagnant and corrupted; not ‘a fountain of living waters’” (Pusey). But this appears to us a farfetched comparison.<p>The pregnant terseness of the last part of the verse will give the English reader a good idea of Nahum’s style and the difficulties therewith connected.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/nahum/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/nahum/2-8.htm" title="But Nineveh is of old like a pool of water: yet they shall flee away.

God looks upon proud cities, and brings them down. Particular account is given of the terrors wherein the invading enemy shall appear against Nineveh. The empire of Assyria is represented as a queen, about to be led captive to Babylon. Guilt in the conscience fills men with terror in an evil day; and what will treasures or glory do for us in times of distress, or in the day of wrath?

It was full not of citizens only, but of other nations poured into it. An old historian says , "The chief and most powerful of those whom Ninus settled there, were the Assyrians, but also, of other nations, whoever willed." Thus, the pool was filled; but at the rebuke of the Lord they flee. "Stand, stand," the prophet speaks in the name of the widowed city; "shut the gates, go up on the walls, resist the enemy, gather yourselves together, form a band to withstand," "but none shalt look back" to the mother-city which calls them; all is forgotten, except their fear; parents, wives, children, the wealth which is plundered, home, worldly repute. So will men leave all things, for the life of this world. "All that a man hath, will he give for his life" <a href="/job/2-4.htm">Job 2:4</a>.

The text is not beyond suspicion in the first clause of the verse. The prophet vividly realises the scene. Nothing will arrest the precipitate flight. The cry, Stand! is unheard, none looks back. Cf. <a href="/jeremiah/46-21.htm" title="Also her hired men are in the middle of her like fatted bullocks; for they also are turned back, and are fled away together: they did not stand, because the day of their calamity was come on them, and the time of their visitation.">Jeremiah 46:21</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/nahum/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - The prophet compares the past and present condition of Nineveh. <span class="cmt_word">But Nineveh is of old like a pool of water;</span> <span class="accented">and</span> (or, <span class="accented">though</span>) <span class="accented">Nineveh hath been like a pool of water all her days.</span> Others, altering the points in accordance with the Septuagint and Vulgate, translate, "But as for Nineveh, her waters are like a pool of water."

She is compared to a pool or reservoir (<a href="/nehemiah/2-15.htm">Nehemiah 2:15</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/3-15.htm">Nehemiah 3:15</a>) from the multitude of her inhabitants gathered from all parts of the world, and streaming unto her, both as tributary and for commercial purposes (comp. <a href="/jeremiah/51-13.htm">Jeremiah 51:13</a>; <a href="/revelation/17-1.htm">Revelation 17:1, 15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Yet they shall flee away.</span> In spite of their numbers, the multitudes represented by "the waters" fly before the enemy.
