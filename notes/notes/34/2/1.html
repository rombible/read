From the description of the peace of Judah, the prophet turns suddenly to her oppressor, to whom, not to Judah, the rest of the prophecy is directed. Jacob and Israel are spoken of, not to . The destroyer of Nineveh "went up against the face of Nineveh," not in the presence of Judah and Jacob, who were far away and knew nothing of it. "Keep the munition." While all in Judah is now peace, all in Nineveh is tumult. God whom they had defied, saying that Hezekiah could not "turn away the face of one captain of the least of his servants" <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/36-9.htm">Isaiah 36:9</a>, now bids them prepare to meet him whom He would send against them. "Gird up thy loins now, like a man" <a href="/job/40-7.htm">Job 40:7</a>. Thou who wouldest lay waste others, now, if theft canst, keep thyself. The strength of the words is the measure of the irony. They had challenged God; He in turn challenges them to put forth all their might.<p>Fence thy defenses - we might say. Their strong walls, high though they were, unassailable by any then known skill of besiegers, would not be secure.<p>The prophet uses a kindred and allusive word, that their protection needed to be itself protected; and this, by one continued watchfulness. Watch, he adds, the way: spy out (as far as thou canst), the coming of the enemy; strengthen the loins, the seat of strength. Elsewhere they are said to be girded up for any exertion. "Fortify thy strength exceedingly." The expression is rare : commonly it is said of some part of the human frame, knees, arms, or mind, or of man by God.<p>The same words are strong mockery to those who resist God, good counsel to those who trust in God. "Keep the munition, for He who keepeth thee will not sleep <a href="/psalms/121-3.htm">Psalm 121:3</a>; watch the way," by which the enemy may approach from afar, for Satan approacheth, sometimes suddenly, sometimes very stealthily and subtly, "transforming himself into an angel of light." Jerome: "Watch also the way by which thou art to go, as it is said, 'Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for the old paths, where is the good way, and walk therein;' <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-16.htm">Jeremiah 6:16</a>, so that, having stood in many ways, we may come to that Way which saith, 'I am the Way.'" Then , "make thy loins strong," as the Saviour commands His disciples, "Let your loins be girded about" <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/12-35.htm">Luke 12:35</a>, and the Apostle says, "Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth" <a href="/ephesians/6-14.htm">Ephesians 6:14</a>; for nothing so strengthens as the Truth. For Christ being the Truth, whose with his whole heart hath belived in Christ, is strong against himself, and hath power over the loins, the seat of the passions. Then, since this warfare is hard, he adds, be strong, "fortify thy power mightily;" resist not listlessly, but vehemently; and that, in His strength who hath strengthened our nature, taking it to Himself and uniting it with the Godhead. For without Him, strong though thou be, thou wilt avail nothing. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/nahum/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 2<p>Na 2:1-13.

O Nineveh, or land of Assyria; for this is not to be understood of Sennacherib's coming up against Jerusalem, as Kimchi; but of Nebuchadnezzar against Nineveh, as Aben Ezra; not Nebuchadnezzar the great, who, the Jewish chronologers say (c), took Nineveh in the first year of his reign; but his father, Nebuchadnezzar the first, called Nabopolassar, who, with Cyaxares or Ahasuerus the Mede, joined their forces against Nineveh, and took it, see the Apocrypha: <p>"But before he died he heard of the destruction of Nineve, which was taken by Nabuchodonosor and Assuerus: and before his death he rejoiced over Nineve.'' (Tobit 14:15) <p>and these together, the Chaldeans and Medes, are the "dasher in pieces"; or, "the hammer" (d), as the word may be rendered; and so Babylon, over which one of these kings reigned, is called the hammer of the whole earth, <a href="/jeremiah/50-23.htm">Jeremiah 50:23</a> these came up openly, boldly, to the face of the king of Assyria, attacked him in his metropolis, not fearing his strength and numbers: <p>keep the munition; this and what follow are spoken ironically to the Assyrian king, and inhabitants of Nineveh, to take care of their towers and garrisons, and fortify them, and fill them with soldiers: and <p>watch the way; in which the enemy came; secure the passes and avenues that lead to their city; stop his march, and prevent his access: <p>make thy loins strong; put on armour, gird on the sword, prepare for war: <p>fortify thy power mightily; increase thine army, exert all thy strength and courage, and do all that is in thy power to do, to oppose the enemy, and defend thyself; and when all is done, it will be in vain. <p>(c) Seder Olam Rabba, c. 24. p. 69.

Jehovah cast him into the depth of the sea, because the seamen were merely the executors of the punishment inflicted upon him by Jehovah. Metsu&#772;la&#770;h, the deep, is defined by "the heart of the seas" as the deepest abyss of the ocean. The plural yamm&#305;&#772;m (seas) is used here with distinct significance, instead of the singular, "into the heart of the sea" (ya&#770;m) in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/15-8.htm">Exodus 15:8</a>, to express the idea of the boundless ocean (see Dietrich, Abhandlung zur hebr. Grammatik, pp. 16, 17). The next clauses are circumstantial clauses, and mean, so that the current of the sea surrounded me, and all the billows and waves of the sea, which Jehovah had raised into a storm, went over me. Na&#770;ha&#770;r, a river or stream, is the streaming or current of the sea, as in <a href="/psalms/24-2.htm">Psalm 24:2</a>. The words of the second hemistich are a reminiscence of <a href="/psalms/42-8.htm">Psalm 42:8</a>. What the Korahite singer of that psalm had experienced spiritually, viz., that one wave of trouble after another swept over him, that had the prophet literally experienced. Jonah "does not say, The waves and the billows of the sea went over me; but Thy waves and Thy billows, because he felt in his conscience that the sea with its waves and billows was the servant of God and of His wrath, to punish sin" (Luther). <a href="/jonah/2-4.htm">Jonah 2:4</a> contains the apodosis to <a href="/jonah/2-3.htm">Jonah 2:3</a>: "When Thou castedst me into the deep, then I said (sc., in my heart, i.e., then I thought) that I was banished from the sphere of Thine eyes, i.e., of Thy protection and care." These words are formed from a reminiscence of <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/31-23.htm">Psalm 31:23</a>, &#1504;&#1490;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; being substituted for the &#1504;&#1490;&#1512;&#1494;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; of the psalm. The second hemistich is attached adversatively. &#1488;&#1498;, which there is no necessity to alter into &#1488;&#1498;  equals  &#1488;&#1497;&#1498;, as Hitzig supposes, introduces the antithesis in an energetic manner, like &#1488;&#1499;&#1501; elsewhere, in the sense of nevertheless, as in <a href="/isaiah/14-15.htm">Isaiah 14:15</a>; <a href="/psalms/49-16.htm">Psalm 49:16</a>; <a href="/job/13-15.htm">Job 13:15</a> (cf. Ewald, 354, a). The thought that it is all over with him is met by the confidence of faith that he will still look to the holy temple of the Lord, that is to say, will once more approach the presence of the Lord, to worship before Him in His temple, - an assurance which recals <a href="/psalms/5-8.htm">Psalm 5:8</a>.<p>The thought that by the grace of the Lord he has been once more miraculously delivered out of the gates of death, and brought to the light of the world, is carried out still further in the following strophe, in entirely new turns of thought. </body></html>
