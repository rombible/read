It is not easy to say whether this verse refers to the besiegers or the besieged.

The siege actually lasted two years, but the prophet condenses the whole into a few brilliant successive scenes. The term rendered “worthies” is translated “nobles,” Ch. <a href="/nahum/3-18.htm" title="Your shepherds slumber, O king of Assyria: your nobles shall dwell in the dust: your people is scattered on the mountains, and no man gathers them.">Nahum 3:18</a>, marg. valiant men, viz. those of the king of Assyria. If the meaning were the same here reference would be to the measures of defence taken by the Assyrian king. The expression “they hasten to the wall” might also seem more natural if the defenders were referred to; and the other expression “they stumble in their walk” (or march) is more likely to be said of worn-out defenders than of an eager enemy in the act of delivering an assault. The phrase could hardly describe the pellmell rush of a storming party towards the wall.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">recount his worthies</span>] <span class="bld">He bethinketh himself of</span> his worthies, or valiant men.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">shall stumble in their walk</span>] <span class="bld">they stumble in their steps</span>. Their stumbling might be due to the suddenness of their call and weariness from the harassing fatigues of the defence. There is no necessity for supposing that the defenders were sunk in sloth and effeminate from debauchery.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the defence shall be prepared</span>] is prepared. The term “defence” (<span class="ital">sokek</span>), lit. <span class="ital">coverer</span>, is obscure in two ways: (1) it is uncertain whether it be a thing or a body of men, an engine or a party of troops, called the coverer, as another similar word is the <span class="ital">ambush</span>, i.e. the party forming an ambuscade: and (2) it is uncertain whether it belongs to the besiegers or the besieged. If the rest of the verse described the defenders this clause would also most naturally be said of them. In this case it would be either some apparatus of defence against the assault of the enemy or a body of men placed in some position to beat back the storming party. City walls were usually provided with turrets or battlements projecting forward over the walls, from which the besieged could observe the movements of the enemy at the foot, and hurl destructive missiles upon them. A party placed in such a position might be intended. (Figures, Billerb.-Jerem., p. 160.) On the other hand, if the <span class="ital">sokek</span> belonged to the besiegers it would probably be some engine for battering the walls, The construction is less natural: they hasten to the wall, <span class="ital">but the</span> sokek <span class="ital">has been prepared</span>—they find the engines in position and at work. There was great variety of battering machines. Besides the usual ram, a beam with an iron head, suspended by chains and swung against the wall, there were engines run on wheels and generally provided with two wall-breachers armed with lance-shaped heads. These rams were not generally swung horizontally but sloping upwards so as to operate on the foundations of the projecting towers, and bring them down. (Figures in Billerb.-Jerem., p. 180 seq.; Layard, II. 367 seq.) These wheeled breaching engines were of course roofed to protect those who worked the rams. Such an engine has some resemblance to the <span class="ital">vinea</span> or mantlet (so R.V. here); the testudo or roof of shields does not seem to have been used in eastern warfare. Moveable towers which put the assailants on a level with the defenders on the wall were also employed, Layard, II. 368 sq.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/nahum/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - The prophet turns to the Ninevites and their preparations for defence. <span class="cmt_word">He shall recount his worthies;</span> <span class="accented">he remembers his nobles.</span> The King of Nineveh calls to mind the mighty captains who have often led his armies to victory, and sends them to defend the walls (comp. <a href="/nahum/3-18.htm">Nahum 3:18</a>). The LXX., anticipating the next clause, adds here, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, "and they shall flee by day." <span class="cmt_word">They shall stumble in their walk.</span> In their fear and baste, or half drunken, they totter and stumble as they hasten to the walls of the city. <span class="cmt_word">The defence shall be prepared;</span> literally, <span class="accented">the covering is prepared.</span> If this refers to the operations of the Ninevites, it means some kind of breastwork or fascine erected between the towers; but it most probably depicts the sight that meets their eyes from the wails. They see the besiegers bringing up their mantelets and towers. As used by the Assyrians, the machine called "the covering" is either a wooden tower or a wicker mantelet in which was suspended a battering ram. It stood on four or six wheels, and the larger sort had archers posted in the various stories, both to annoy the enemy and to defend the engine. The rams were provided with lance headed extremities, and must have rather picked at and loosened the courses of bricks of which the walls were composed than battered them down (see Bonomi, 'Nineveh and its Palaces,' pp. 160, 234, 243, etc. Layard, 'Nineveh,' ch. 5. p. 376, etc., figs. 57, 58).

The first clause of the fifth verse recals to mind <a href="/psalms/18-5.htm">Psalm 18:5</a> and <a href="/psalms/69-2.htm">Psalm 69:2</a>; the words "the waters pressed (&#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;) even to the soul" (<a href="/psalms/69-2.htm">Psalm 69:2</a>) being simply strengthened by &#1488;&#1508;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; after <a href="/psalms/18-5.htm">Psalm 18:5</a>. The waters of the sea girt him round about, reaching even to the soul, so that it appeared to be all over with his life. Teho&#772;m, the unfathomable flood of the ocean, surrounded him. Su&#772;ph, sedge, i.e., sea-grass, which grows at the bottom of the sea, was bound about his head; so that he had sunk to the very bottom. This thought is expressed still more distinctly in <a href="/psalms/18-6.htm">Psalm 18:6</a>. &#1511;&#1510;&#1489;&#1497; &#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, "the ends of the mountains" (from qa&#770;tsabh, to cut off, that which is cut off, then the place where anything is cut off), are their foundations and roots, which lie in the depths of the earth, reaching even to the foundation of the sea (cf. <a href="/psalms/18-16.htm">Psalm 18:16</a>). When he sank into the deep, the earth shut its bolts behind him (&#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; is placed at the head absolutely). The figure of bolts of the earth that were shut behind Jonah, which we only meet with here (&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1491; from the phrase &#1505;&#1490;&#1512; &#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514; &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1491;, to shut the door behind a person: <a href="/genesis/7-16.htm">Genesis 7:16</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/4-4.htm">2 Kings 4:4-5</a>, <a href="/2_kings/4-33.htm">2 Kings 4:33</a>; <a href="/isaiah/26-20.htm">Isaiah 26:20</a>), has an analogy in the idea which occurs in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/38-10.htm">Job 38:10</a>, of bolts and doors of the ocean. The bolts of the sea are the walls of the sea-basin, which set bounds to the sea, that it cannot pass over. Consequently the bolts of the earth can only be such barriers as restrain the land from spreading over the sea. These barriers are the weight and force of the waves, which prevent the land from encroaching on the sea. This weight of the waves, or of the great masses of water, which pressed upon Jonah when he had sunk to the bottom of the sea, shut or bolted against him the way back to the earth (the land), just as the bolts that are drawn before the door of a house fasten up the entrance into it; so that the reference is neither to "the rocks jutting out above the water, which prevented any one from ascending from the sea to the land," nor "densissima terrae compages, qua abyssus tecta Jonam in hac constitutum occludebat" (Marck). Out of this grave the Lord "brought up his life." Shachath is rendered &#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;, corruptio, by the early translators (lxx, Chald., Syr., Vulg.); and this rendering, which many of the more modern translators entirely reject, is unquestionably the correct one in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/17-14.htm">Job 17:14</a>, where the meaning "pit" is quite unsuitable. But it is by no means warranted in the present instance. The similarity of thought to <a href="/psalms/30-4.htm">Psalm 30:4</a> points rather to the meaning pit  equals  cavern or grave, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/30-10.htm">Psalm 30:10</a>, where shachath is used interchangeably with &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512; and &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1500; in <a href="/jonah/2-4.htm">Jonah 2:4</a> as being perfectly synonymous. <a href="/jonah/2-7.htm">Jonah 2:7</a> is formed after <a href="/psalms/142-4.htm">Psalm 142:4</a> or <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/143-4.htm">Psalm 143:4</a>, except that &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; is used instead of &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1497;, because Jonah is not speaking of the covering of the spirit with faintness, but of the plunging of the life into night and the darkness of death by drowning in the water. &#1492;&#1514;&#1506;&#1496;&#1468;&#1507;, lit., to veil or cover one's self, hence to sink into night and faintness, to pine away. &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;, upon or in me, inasmuch as the I, as a person, embraces the soul or life (cf. <a href="/psalms/42-5.htm">Psalm 42:5</a>). When his soul was about to sink into the night of death, he thought of Jehovah in prayer, and his prayer reached to God in His holy temple, where Jehovah is enthroned as God and King of His people (<a href="/psalms/18-7.htm">Psalm 18:7</a>; <a href="/psalms/88-3.htm">Psalm 88:3</a>).<p>But when prayer reaches to God, then He helps and also saves. This awakens confidence in the Lord, and impels to praise and thanksgiving. These thoughts form the last strophe, with which the Psalm of thanksgiving is appropriately closed. </body></html>
