With some sinners God makes quick despatch; and one way or other, he will make an utter end of all his enemies. Though they are quiet, and many very secure, and not in fear, they shall be cut down as grass and corn, when the destroying angel passes through. God would hereby work great deliverance for his own people. But those who make themselves vile by scandalous sins, God will make vile by shameful punishments. The tidings of this great deliverance shall be welcomed with abundant joy. These words are applied to the great redemption wrought out by our Lord Jesus and the everlasting gospel, Ro 10:15. Christ's ministers are messengers of good tidings, that preach peace by Jesus Christ. How welcome to those who see their misery and danger by sin! And the promise they made in the day of trouble must be made good. Let us be thankful for God's ordinances, and gladly attend them.

This is said to be at the present time of writing this prophecy, though it was after it, because of the certainty of it, as is usual in prophetic language; unless it can be thought that this prophecy was delivered out exactly at the time when Sennacherib had entered Judea, and was before the walls of Jerusalem; but not yet discomfited, as after predicted: <p>that imagineth evil against the Lord; against the people of the Lord, as the Targum; formed a scheme to invade the land of Judea, take the fenced cities thereof, and seize upon Jerusalem the metropolis of the nation, and carry the king, princes, and all the people captive as Shalmaneser his father had carried away the ten tribes: <p>a wicked counsellor; or "a counsellor of Belial" (k); who, by Rabshakeh, advised Israel not to regard their king, nor trust in their God but surrender themselves up to him, <a href="/2_kings/18-29.htm">2 Kings 18:29</a>. <p>(k)  "consulens", Belijahai, Montanus; "consiliarius Belijaal", Burkius. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/nahum/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">There is <i>one</i> <span class="cverse3">{m}</span> come out of thee, that imagineth evil against the LORD, a wicked counsellor.</span><p>(m) Which may be understood either of Sennacherib, or of the whole body of the people of Nineveh.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/nahum/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">11</span>. <span class="ital">There is</span> one <span class="ital">come out</span>] Rather: <span class="bld">out of thee came he</span> (or, one) <span class="bld">forth who imagined … who counselled mischief</span>.

In this sudden change in the weather, the arm of the holy God was so suddenly manifested, that the sailors "feared Jehovah with great fear, and offered sacrifice to Jehovah" - not after they landed, but immediately, on board the ship - "and vowed vows," i.e., vowed that they would offer Him still further sacrifices on their safe arrival at their destination. </body></html>
