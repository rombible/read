It is evidently the finale of the proclamation against the Assyrian invader, and rightly stands in the LXX. as the last verse of Nahum 2. It portrays the announcement of Sennacherib’s fate to the towns and villages of Judah. “From mountain-top to mountain-top by beacon fires they spread the glad tidings. Suddenly the deliverance comes, sudden its announcement. <span class= "ital">Behold,</span> Judah, before hindered by armies from going up to Jerusalem, its cities taken, may now again <span class= "ital">keep the feasts</span> there, and <span class= "ital">pay the vows</span> which in trouble she promised; <span class= "ital">for the wicked one,</span> the ungodly Sennacherib, <span class= "ital">is utterly cut off; he shall no more pass through thee</span>” (Pusey).

These deliverances being typical of the great redemption wrought out for us by the Messiah, the words are applied by the apostle (<a href="/romans/10-15.htm" title="And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!">Romans 10:15</a>) to the gospel, which brings us glad tidings of that redemption, and of all the spiritual and eternal blessings consequent upon it. <span class="ital">O Judah, keep thy solemn feasts — </span>As thou now hast liberty to do, and mayest do with joy and gladness, being freed from thy fears; and to do which thou art now under peculiar obligations, having been so wonderfully delivered from the oppressive power of thy enemies; and having solemnly vowed to God, when thou wast in distress, that thou wouldest worship and serve him according to the precepts of his law, if thou shouldest be delivered from any further fear of thy oppressors. <span class="ital">For the wicked shall no more pass through thee — </span>The impious Assyrians, who set at naught and blasphemed Jehovah, thy God, shall no more come against thee. <span class="ital">He is utterly cut off — </span>The oppressor is taken away, and the Assyrian empire utterly and for ever ruined. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/nahum/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:9-15 There is a great deal plotted against the Lord by the gates of hell, and against his kingdom in the world; but it will prove in vain. With some sinners God makes quick despatch; and one way or other, he will make an utter end of all his enemies. Though they are quiet, and many very secure, and not in fear, they shall be cut down as grass and corn, when the destroying angel passes through. God would hereby work great deliverance for his own people. But those who make themselves vile by scandalous sins, God will make vile by shameful punishments. The tidings of this great deliverance shall be welcomed with abundant joy. These words are applied to the great redemption wrought out by our Lord Jesus and the everlasting gospel, Ro 10:15. Christ's ministers are messengers of good tidings, that preach peace by Jesus Christ. How welcome to those who see their misery and danger by sin! And the promise they made in the day of trouble must be made good. Let us be thankful for God's ordinances, and gladly attend them. Let us look forward with cheerful hope to a world where the wicked never can enter, and sin and temptation will no more be known.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/nahum/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That publisheth peace - This declaration is general, that the coming of such a messenger would be attended with joy. The particular and special idea here is, that it would be a joyful announcement that this captivity was ended, and that Zion was about to be restored.<p>That bringeth good tidings of good - He announces that which is good or which is a joyful message.<p>That saith unto Zion, thy God reigneth - That is, thy God has delivered the people from their captivity, and is about to reign again in Zion. This was applied at first to the return from the captivity. Paul, as has been already observed, applies it to the ministers of the gospel. That is, it is language which will well express the nature of the message which the ministers of the gospel bear to their fellow-men. The sense is here, that the coming of a messenger bringing good news is universally agreeable to people. And it the coming of a messenger announcing that peace is made, is pleasant; or if the coming of such a messenger declaring that the captivity at Babylon was ended, was delightful, how much more so should be the coming of the herald announcing that man may be at peace with his Maker? <p><a href="/nahum/1-15.htm">Nahum 1:15</a>Behold upon the mountains, the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace - From mountain-top to mountain-top by beacon-fires they spread the glad tidings. Suddenly the deliverance comes, sudden its announcement. "Behold!" Judah, before hindered by armies from going up to Jerusalem, its cities taken <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/18-13.htm">2 Kings 18:13</a>, may now again "keep the feasts" there, and "pay the vows," which "in trouble she promised;" "for the wicked one," the ungodly Sennacherib, "is utterly cut off, he shall no more pass through thee;" "the army and king and empire of the Assyrians have perished." But the words of prophecy cannot be bound down to this. These large promises, which, as to this world, were forfeited in the next reign, when Manasseh was taken captive to Babylon, and still more in the seventy years' captivity, and more yet in that until now, look for a fulfillment, as they stand.<p>They sound so absolute. "I will afflict thee no more," "the wicked shall no more pass through thee," "he is utterly (literally, the whole of him) cut off." Nahum joins on this signal complete deliverance from a temporal enemy, to the final deliverance of the people of God. The invasion of Sennacherib was an avowed conflict with God Himself. It was a defiance of God. He would make God's people, his; he would "cut it off that it be no more a people, and that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance" <a href="/psalms/83-4.htm">Psalm 83:4</a>. There was a more "evil counselor" behind, whose agent was Sennacherib. He, as he is the author of all murders and strife, so has he a special hatred for the Church, whether before or since Christ's Coming. Before, that he right cut off that Line from whom "the Seed of the woman" should be born, which should destroy his empire and crush himself, and that he might devour the Child who was to be born <a href="/revelation/12-4.htm">Revelation 12:4</a>.<p>Since, because her members are his freed captives, and she makes inroads on his kingdom, and he hates them because he hates God and Christ who dwells in them. As the time of the birth of our Lord neared, his hate became more concentrated. God overruled the hatred of Edom or Moab, or the pride of Assyria, to His own ends, to preserve Israel by chastising it. Their hatred was from the evil one, because it was God's people, the seed of Abraham, the tribe of Judah, the line of David. If they could be cut off, they of whom Christ was to be born according to the flesh, and so, in all seeming, the hope of the world, were gone. Sennacherib then was not a picture only, he was the agent of Satan, who used his hands, feet, tongue, to blaspheme God and war against His people. As then we have respect not to the mere agent, but to the principal, and should address him through those he employed (as Elisha said of the messenger who came to slay him, "is not the sound of his master's feet behind him?" <a href="/2_kings/6-32.htm">2 Kings 6:32</a>), so the prophet's words chiefly and most fully go to the instigator of Sennacherib, whose very name he names, Belial. It is the deliverance of the Church and the people of God which he foretells, and thanks God for.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/nahum/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15.

It is nearly the same as Isa 52:7, referring to the similar deliverance from Babylon.<p>him that bringeth good tidings&#8212;announcing the overthrow of Sennacherib and deliverance of Jerusalem. The "mountains" are those round Jerusalem, on which Sennacherib's host had so lately encamped, preventing Judah from keeping her "feasts," but on which messengers now speed to Jerusalem, publishing his overthrow with a loud voice where lately they durst not have opened their mouths.

This seems most agreeable to the method of the prophecy, wherein threat is succeeded by promise, denunciation of the enemy by declaration of comfort to Judah (comp. <a href="/nahum/1-6.htm">Nahum 1:6, 7, 12</a>, and 13; so here vers. 14 and 15). The prophet announces the joy with which Judah receives the news of the overthrow of Nineveh. <span class="cmt_word">Behold upon the mountains,</span> etc. Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/52-7.htm">Isaiah 52:7</a>) uses these words to proclaim the coming of Messiah (comp. <a href="/isaiah/40-9.htm">Isaiah 40:9</a>; <a href="/romans/10-15.htm">Romans 10:15</a>). The messengers come from the East across the mountains of Palestine, announcing the fall of Nineveh and the consequent peace and security of Judah - a type of the overthrow of God's enemies and the safety of his Church. There may be an allusion to the custom of spreading tidings by beacon fires. <span class="cmt_word">Keep thy solemn feasts.</span> Judah is exhorted to resume the observation of her solemnities, which were interrupted during the enemy's occupation of the country, or which could not be properly attended by the distant inhabitants.

As a throat or swallow is ascribed to she'o&#772;l in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/5-14.htm">Isaiah 5:14</a>, so here it is spoken of as having a &#1489;&#1496;&#1503;, or belly. This is not to be taken as referring to the belly of the shark, as Jerome supposes. The expression is a poetical figure used to denote the danger of death, from which there is apparently no escape; like the encompassing with snares of death in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/18-5.htm">Psalm 18:5</a>, and the bringing up of the soul out of sheol in <a href="/psalms/30-3.htm">Psalm 30:3</a>. In the last clause the words pass over very appropriately into an address to Jehovah, which is brought out into still greater prominence by the omission of the copula Vav. </body></html>
