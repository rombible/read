With some sinners God makes quick despatch; and one way or other, he will make an utter end of all his enemies. Though they are quiet, and many very secure, and not in fear, they shall be cut down as grass and corn, when the destroying angel passes through. God would hereby work great deliverance for his own people. But those who make themselves vile by scandalous sins, God will make vile by shameful punishments. The tidings of this great deliverance shall be welcomed with abundant joy. These words are applied to the great redemption wrought out by our Lord Jesus and the everlasting gospel, Ro 10:15. Christ's ministers are messengers of good tidings, that preach peace by Jesus Christ. How welcome to those who see their misery and danger by sin! And the promise they made in the day of trouble must be made good. Let us be thankful for God's ordinances, and gladly attend them. Let us look forward with cheerful hope to a world where the wicked never can enter, and sin and temptation will no more be known.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/nahum/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Though they be quiet and likewise many, yet thus shall they be cut down - Literally, "If they be entire," i. e., sound unharmed, unimpaired in their numbers, unbroken in their strength, undiminished, perfect in all which belongs to war; "and thus many even thus shall they be mown down (or shorn), and he passeth away" . With might outwardly unscathed, "without hand" <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/2-34.htm">Daniel 2:34</a>, and "thus many," i. e., many, accordingly, as being unweakened; as many as they shall be, "so shall they be mown down, and he," their head and king, "shall pass away and perish" (compare <a href="/psalms/48-4.htm">Psalm 48:4</a>). Their numbers shall be, as their condition before, perfect; their destruction as their numbers, complete. It is wonderful how much God says in few words; and how it is here foretold that, with no previous loss, a mighty host secure and at ease, in consequence of their prosperity, all are at one blow mown down, like the dry grass before the scythe, are cut off and perish; and one, their king, "passeth away," first by flight, and then by destruction. As they had shorn the glory of others <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/7-20.htm">Isaiah 7:20</a>, so should they be shorn and cut down themselves.<p>Though I have afflicted thee, I will afflict thee no more - o. Unless by new guilt thou compel Me. God always relieves us from trouble, as it were with the words, "sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee" <a href="/john/5-14.htm">John 5:14</a>.

The same truths repeated as in Na 1:9-11, Jehovah here being the speaker. He addresses Judah, prophesying good to it, and evil to the Assyrian.<p>Though they be quiet&#8212;that is, without fear, and tranquilly secure. So Chaldee and Calvin. Or, "entire," "complete"; "Though their power be unbroken [Maurer], and though they be so many, yet even so they shall be cut down" (literally, "shorn"; as hair shaved off closely by a razor, Isa 7:20). As the Assyrian was a razor shaving others, so shall he be shaven himself. Retribution in kind. In the height of their pride and power, they shall be clean cut off. The same Hebrew stands for "likewise" and "yet thus." So many as they are, so many shall they perish.<p>when he shall pass through&#8212;or, "and he shall pass away," namely, "the wicked counsellor" (Na 1:11), Sennacherib. The change of number to the singular distinguishes him from his host. They shall be cut down, he shall pass away home (2Ki 19:35, 36) [Henderson]. English Version is better, "they shall be cut down, "when" He (Jehovah) shall pass through," destroying by one stroke the Assyrian host. This gives the reason why they with all their numbers and power are to be so utterly cut off. Compare "pass through," that is, in destroying power (Eze 12:12, 23; Isa 8:8; Da 11:10).<p>Though I have afflicted thee&#8212;Judah, "I will afflict thee no more" (Isa 40:1, 2; 52:1, 2). The contrast is between "they," the Assyrians, and "thee," Judah. Their punishment is fatal and final. Judah's was temporary and corrective.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/nahum/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Thus saith the Lord:</span> this addeth weight to his prediction, it comes under the great seal of Heaven. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Though they be quiet, and likewise many; </span> or, If they would have been quiet and peaceable towards my people, Israel, they, i.e. the Assyrians, should have been many, &c.; but I think it is nearer to the intent of the place to retain our version.

The Assyrian army under Sennacherib before Jerusalem, though they were quiet and secure and thought themselves out of all danger; not at all fearing that the besieged would sally out against them they being so numerous, and therefore betook themselves to sleep and rest: <p>yet thus shall they be cut down; or "shorn" (l); as the wool is shorn off the back of a sheep with sheers; or grass or corn is mowed with a scythe; or else as the hair of a man's head and beard are shaved with a razor; which sometimes was done, not only in a way of ignominy and contempt, as David's servants were served by Hanun, <a href="/2_samuel/10-4.htm">2 Samuel 10:4</a>; but as a token of servitude; hence those words of the poet (m), <p>"after thou art a servant, dost thou let thy hair grow?'' <p>upon which it is observed (n), that it belongs to freemen to let the hair grow; and so the philosopher says (o), to let the hair grow, or to nourish it, is commendable with a Lacedemonian, for it is a sign of liberty; for it is not for him who lets his hair grow to do any servile work; and it was usual with conquerors to shave the conquered, and such as were carried captives (p), which some think is referred to in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-42.htm">Deuteronomy 32:42</a>; and render the latter clause of that verse, <p>"and there shall be captivity, by reason of the head of nakedness of the enemy;'' <p>that is, there should be captives whose heads should be made bare, or shaved by the enemy the conqueror (q); hence the king of Assyria, when a conqueror, is compared to a sharp razor, that should shave the head, and feet, and beard, even all sorts of people, <a href="/isaiah/7-20.htm">Isaiah 7:20</a>; but now he and his army should be shaved themselves; that is, conquered, slain, or taken captives, and become slaves, and treated with contempt; all which may be taken into the sense of this phrase, and serve to illustrate it: <p>when he shall pass through; when the angel should pass through the camp of the Assyrians, then were they cut down by him in great numbers, a hundred and fourscore and five thousand slain at once, <a href="/2_kings/19-35.htm">2 Kings 19:35</a>; <p>though I have afflicted thee, I will afflict thee no more: or "any longer" (r); though the Lord had afflicted the people of the Jews by the Assyrian king, the rod of his anger, again and again, yet after this he would afflict them no more by him; for otherwise they were afflicted afterwards, yet not by the Assyrians, but by the Babylonians, Syrians, and Romans, Some understand this, as before, of the Ninevites and Assyrians, that should be utterly destroyed at once, and their affliction should not be a second time; see <a href="/nahum/1-9.htm">Nahum 1:9</a>; so Abarbinel: or, "I will not hear thee any more" (s); as he did formerly, when they repented at the preaching of Jonah. <p>(l) "tonsi", Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator.

The verse is very obscure. Sept. partly read differently and partly divided the letters otherwise, and did not find the word <span class="ital">likewise</span> in their text, rendering, <span class="ital">Thus saith the Lord who ruleth over many waters;</span> and Syr., <span class="ital">Thus saith the Lord concerning the heads</span> (rulers?) <span class="ital">of many waters</span>. The present text may be rendered with R.V., <span class="ital">though they be in full strength and likewise many, even so shall they be cut down, and shall pass away</span>. The word “cut down” as pointed is used elsewhere only of shearing sheep or the hair of the head, and even if the figure were that of thorns as <span class="ital"><a href="/nahum/1-10.htm" title="For while they be entwined together as thorns, and while they are drunken as drunkards, they shall be devoured as stubble fully dry.">Nahum 1:10</a></span>, seems inappropriate.

This rendering would make the reference be to Nineveh, and the meaning be that the affliction would be once for all and final.
