Nineveh knows not that God who contends with her, but is told what a God he is. It is good for all to mix faith with what is here said concerning Him, which speaks great terror to the wicked, and comfort to believers. Let each take his portion from it: let sinners read it and tremble; and let saints read it and triumph. The anger of the Lord is contrasted with his goodness to his people. Perhaps they are obscure and little regarded in the world, but the Lord knows them. The Scripture character of Jehovah agrees not with the views of proud reasoners. The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ is slow to wrath and ready to forgive, but he will by no means acquit the wicked; and there is tribulation and anguish for every soul that doeth evil: but who duly regards the power of his wrath?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/nahum/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Then, Naham too recites that character of mercy recorded by Moses, "The Lord is slow to anger, and great in power" <a href="/nahum/1-3.htm">Nahum 1:3</a>. But anger, although slow, comes, he adds, not the less certainly on the guilty; "and will not at all clear the guilty" <a href="/nahum/1-3.htm">Nahum 1:3</a>. The iniquity is full. As a whole, there is no more room for repentance. Nineveh had had its prophet, and had been spared, and had sunk back into its old sins. The office of Nahum is to pronounce its sentence. That sentence is fixed. "There is no healing of thy bruise" <a href="/nahum/3-19.htm">Nahum 3:19</a>. Nothing is said of its ulterior conversion or restoration. On the contrary, Nahum says, "He will make the place thereof an utter desolation" <a href="/nahum/1-8.htm">Nahum 1:8</a>.<p>The sins of Nineveh spoken of by Nahum are the same as those from which they had turned at the preaching of Jonah. In Jonah, it is, "the violence of their hands" <a href="/jonah/3-8.htm">Jonah 3:8</a>. Nahum describes Nineveh as "a dwelling of lions, filled with prey and with ravin, the feeding-place of young lions, where the lion tore enough for his whelps" <a href="//biblehub.com/nahum/2-11.htm">Nahum 2:11-12</a>; "a city of bloods, full of lies and robbery, from which the prey departeth not" <a href="/nahum/3-1.htm">Nahum 3:1</a>.<p>But, amid this mass of evil, one thing was eminent, in direct antagonism to God. The character is very special. It is not simply of rebellion against God, or neglect of Him. It is a direct disputation of His Sovereignty. Twice the prophet repeats the characteristic expression, "What will ye devise against the Lord?" "devising evil against the Lord;" and adds, "counselor of evil" <a href="/nahum/1-11.htm">Nahum 1:11</a>. This was exactly the character of Sennacherib, whose wars, like those of his forefathers, (as appears from the cuneiform inscriptions . There were religious wars, and Sennacherib blasphemously compared God to the local deities of the countries, which his forefathers or himself had destroyed <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/36-18.htm">Isaiah 36:18-20</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/37-10.htm">Isaiah 37:10-13</a>. Of this enemy Nahum speaks, as having "gone forth;" out of thee (Nineveh) hath gone forth <a href="/nahum/1-11.htm">Nahum 1:11</a> one, devising evil against the Lord, a counselor of Belial. This was past.<p>Their purpose was inchoate, yet incomplete. God challenges them, "What will ye devise so vehemently against the Lord?" <a href="/nahum/1-9.htm">Nahum 1:9</a>. The destruction too is proximate. The prophet answers for God, "He Himself, by Himself is already making an utter end" <a href="/nahum/1-9.htm">Nahum 1:9</a>. To Jerusalem he turns, "And now I will break his yoke from off thee, and will break his bonds asunder" <a href="/nahum/1-13.htm">Nahum 1:13</a>. Twice the prophet mentions the device against God; each time he answers it by the prediction of the sudden utter destruction of the enemy, while in the most perfect security. "While they are intertwined as thorns, and swallowed up as their drink, they are devoured as stubble fully dry" <a href="/nahum/1-10.htm">Nahum 1:10</a>; and, "If they are perfect" <a href="//biblehub.com/nahum/1-12.htm">Nahum 1:12</a>, unimpaired in their strength, "and thus many, even thus shall they be mown down." Their destruction was to be, their numbers, complete. With no previous loss, secure and at ease, a mighty host, in consequence of their prosperity, all were, at one blow, mown down; "and he (their king, who counseled against the Lord) shall pass away and perish."<p>"The abundance of the wool in the fleece is no hindrance to the shears," nor of the grass to the sythe, nor of the Assyrian host to the will of the Lord, After he, the chief, had thus passed away, Nahum foretells that remarkable death, in connection with the house of his gods; "Out of the house of thy gods I will cut off the graven image and the molten image: I will make thy grave" <a href="/nahum/1-14.htm">Nahum 1:14</a>. There is no natural construction of these words, except, "I will make it thy grave" . Judah too was, by the presence of the Assyrian, hindered from going up to worship at Jerusalem. The prophet bids to proclaim peace to Jerusalem; "keep thy feasts - for the wicked shall no more pass through thee." It was then by the presence of the wicked, that they were now hindered from keeping their feasts, which could be kept only at Jerusalem.<p>The prophecy of Nahum coincides then with that of Isaiah, when Hezekiah prayed against Sennacherib. In the history <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/19-4.htm">2 Kings 19:4</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/19-22.htm">2 Kings 19:22-28</a>, and in the prophecy of Isaiah, the reproach and blasphemy and rage against God are prominent, as an evil design against God is in Nahum. In Isaiah we have the messengers sent to blaspheme <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/37-4.htm">Isaiah 37:4</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/37-23.htm">Isaiah 37:23-29</a>; in Nahum, the promise, that "the voice of thy messengers shall no more be heard." Isaiah prophesies the fruitlessness of his attempt against Jerusalem <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/37-33.htm">Isaiah 37:33-34</a>; his disgraced return; his violent death in his own land <a href="/isaiah/37-7.htm">Isaiah 37:7</a>; Nahum prophesies the entire destruction of his army, his own passing away, his grave. Isaiah, in Jerusalem, foretells how the spontaneous fruits of the earth shall be restored to them <a href="/2_kings/19-29.htm">2 Kings 19:29</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/37-30.htm">Isaiah 37:30</a>, and so, that they shall have possession of the open corn-country; Nahum, living probably in the country, foretells the free access to Jerusalem, and bids them to (<a href="/nahum/1-15.htm">Nahum 1:15</a>; <a href="/nahum/2-1.htm">Nahum 2:1</a> (<a href="/nahum/2-2.htm">Nahum 2:2</a> in Hebrew)) keep their feasts, and perform the vows, which, in their trouble, they had promised to God. He does not only foretell that they may, but he enjoins them to do it.<p>The words (<a href="/nahum/2-2.htm">Nahum 2:2</a> (verse 3 in Hebrew)), "the emptiers have emptied them out and marred their vine branches," may relate to the first expedition of Sennacherib, when, Holy Scripture says, he "came up against all the fenced cities of Judah and took them," and Hezekiah gave him "thirty talents of gold and 300 talents of silver" <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/18-13.htm">2 Kings 18:13-14</a>; <a href="/isaiah/36-1.htm">Isaiah 36:1</a>. Sennacherib himself says , "Hezekiah, king of Judah, who had not submitted to my authority, forty-six of his principal cities, and fortresses and villages depending upon them of which I took no account, I captured, and carried away their spoil. And from these places I captured and carried off as spoil 200, 150 people," etc. This must relate to the first expedition, on account of the exact correspondence of the tribute in gold, with a variation in the number of the talents of silver, easily accounted for .<p>In the first invasion Sennacherib relates that he besieged Jerusalem. : "Hezekiah himself I shut up in Jerusalem his capital city, like a bird in a cage, building towers round the city to fence him in, and raising banks of earth against the gates, so as to prevent escape." It is perhaps in reference to this, that, in the second invasion, God promises by Isaiah; "He shall not come into this city, and shall not shoot an arrow there; and shall not present shield before it, and shall not cast up bank against it" <a href="/isaiah/37-33.htm">Isaiah 37:33</a>. Still, in this second invasion also, Holy Scripture relates, that "the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem unto king Hezekiah with a great army" <a href="/isaiah/36-2.htm">Isaiah 36:2</a>; <a href="/2_kings/18-17.htm">2 Kings 18:17</a>. Perhaps it is in regard to this second expedition, that God says, "Though I have afflicted thee, I will affict thee no more" <a href="/nahum/1-12.htm">Nahum 1:12</a>; i. e., this second invasion should not desolate her, like that first. Not that God absolutely would not again afflict her, but not now. The yoke of the Assyrian was then broken, until the fresh sins of Manasseh drew down their own punishment.<p>Nahum then was a prophet for Judah, or for that remnant of Israel, which, after the ten tribes were carried captive, became one with Judah, not in temporal sovereignty, but in the one worship of God. His mention of Basan, Carmel and Lebanon alone, as places lying under the rebuke of God, perhaps implies a special interest in Northern Palestine. Judah may have already become the name for the whole people of God who were left in their own land, since those of the ten tribes who remained had now no separate religious or political existence. The idol-center of their worship was gone into captivity.<p>The old tradition agrees with this as to the name of the birthplace of Nahum, "the Elkoshite." "Some think," says Jerome , "that Elcesaeus was the father of Nahum, and, according to the Hebrew tradition, was also a prophet; whereas Elcesi  is even to this day a little village in Galilee, small indeed, and scarcely indicating by its ruins the traces of ancient buildings, yet known to the Jews, and pointed out to me too by my guide." The name is a genuine Hebrew name, the "El," with which it begins, being the name of God, which appears in the names of other towns also as El'ale, Eltolad, Elteke Eltolem. The author of the short-lived Gnostic heresy of the Elcesaites, called Elkesai, elkasai, elxai, elxaios, Elkasaios , probably had his name from that same village. Eusebius mentions Elkese, as the place "whence was Nahum the Elkesaean." Cyril of Alexandria says, that Elkese was a village somewhere in Judaea.<p>On the other hand "Alcush," a town in Mosul, is probably a name of Arabic origin, and is not connected with Nahum by any extant or known writer, earlier than Masius toward the end of the 16th century , and an Arabic scribe in 1713 . Neither of these mention the tomb. "The tomb," says Layard , "is a simple plaster box, covered with green cloth, and standing at the upper end of a large chamber. The house containing the tomb is a modern building. There are no inscriptions, nor fragments of any antiquity near the place." The place is now reverenced by the Jews, but in the 12th century Benjamin of Tudela  supposed his tomb to be at Ain Japhata, South of Babylon. Were anything needed to invalidate statements more than 2000 years after the time of Nahum, it might suffice that the Jews, who are the authors of this story, maintain that not Jonah only but Obadiah and Jephthah the Gileadite are also buried at Mosul .<p>Nor were the ten tribes placed there, but "in the cities of the Medes" <a href="/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6</a>. The name Capernaum, "the village of Nahum," is probably an indication of his residence in Galilee. There is nothing in his language unique to the Northern tribes. One very poetic word <a href="/nahum/3-2.htm">Nahum 3:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/5-22.htm">Judges 5:22</a>, common to him with the song of Deborah, is not therefore a "provincialism," because it only happens to occur in the rich, varied, language of two prophets of North Palestine. Nor does the occurrence of a foreign title interfere with "purity of diction" . It rather belongs to the vividness of his description.<p>The conquest of No-Ammon or Thebes and the captivity of its inhabitants, of which Nahum speaks, must have been by Assyria itself. Certainly it was not from domestic disturbances ; for Nahum says, that the people were carried away captive <a href="/nahum/3-10.htm">Nahum 3:10</a>. Nor was it from the Ethiopians ; for Nahum speaks of them, as her allies <a href="/nahum/3-9.htm">Nahum 3:9</a>. Nor from the Carthaginians ; for the account of Ammianus , that "when first Carthage was beginning to expand itself far and wide, the Punic generals, by an unexpected inroad, subdued the hundred-gated Thebes," is merely a mistaken gloss on a statement of Diodorus, that  "Hanno took Hekatompylos by siege;" a city, according to Diodorus himself , "in the desert of Libya." Nor was it from the Scythians ; for Herodotus, who alone speaks of their maraudings and who manifestly exaggerates them, expressly says, that Psammetichus induced the Scythians by presents not to enter Egypt ; and a wandering predatory horde does not besiege or take strongly-fortified towns.<p>There remain then only the Assyrians. Four successive Assyrian Monarchs Sargon, his son, grandson and great grandson, Sennacherib, Esarhaddon, Asshur-bani-pal, from 718 b.c. to about 657 b.c., conquered in Egypt . The hostility was first provoked by the encouragement given by Sabacho the Ethiopian (Sab'e  in the cuneiform inscriptions, S b k, in Egyptian), the So of Holy Scripture , to Hoshea to rebel against Shalmaneser <a href="/2_kings/17-4.htm">2 Kings 17:4</a>. Sargon, who, according to his own statement, was the king who actually took Samaria , led three expeditions of his own against Egypt. In the first, Sargon defeated the Egyptian king in the battle of Raphia ; in the second, in his seventh year, he boasts that Pharaoh became his tributary ; in a third, which is placed three years later, Ethiopia submitted to him .<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/nahum/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. jealous&#8212;In this there is sternness, yet tender affection. We are jealous only of those we love: a husband, of a wife; a king, of his subjects' loyalty. God is jealous of men because He loves them. God will not bear a rival in His claims on them. His burning jealousy for His own wounded honor and their love, as much as His justice, accounts for all His fearful judgments: the flood, the destruction of Jerusalem, that of Nineveh. His jealousy will not admit of His friends being oppressed, and their enemies flourishing (compare Ex 20:5; 1Co 16:22; 2Co 11:2). Burning zeal enters into the idea in "jealous" here (compare Nu 25:11, 13; 1Ki 19:10).<p>the Lord revengeth &#8230; Lord revengeth&#8212;The repetition of the incommunicable name Jehovah, and of His revenging, gives an awful solemnity to the introduction.<p>furious&#8212;literally, "a master of fury."

In the case of the penitent, He does not reserve or retain His anger (Ps 103:9; Jer 3:5, 12; Mic 7:18).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/nahum/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">God;

He is jealous of his own honour and glory, and for his own worship and ordinances; and will not give his glory to another, nor his praise to graven images; and therefore will punish all idolaters, and particularly the idolatrous Assyrians: he is jealous for his people, and cannot bear to see them injured; and will avenge the affronts that are offered, and the indignities done unto them: <p>the Lord revengeth, and is furious; or, is "master of wrath" (u); full of it, or has it at his command; can restrain it, and let it out as he pleases, which man cannot do; a furious and passionate man, who has no rule over his spirit. The Lord's revenging is repeated for the confirmation of it; yea, it is a third time observed, as follows; which some of the Jewish writers think has respect to the three times the king of Assyria carried the people of Israel captive, and for which the Lord would be revenged on him, and punish him: <p>the Lord will take vengeance on his adversaries; on all his adversaries; particularly the Assyrians are here meant, who were both the enemies of him and of his people. The Targum explains it, <p>"that hate his people:'' <p>vengeance belongs to the Lord, and he will repay it sooner or later; if not immediately, he will hereafter; for it follows: <p>and he reserveth wrath for his enemies: and them for that; if not in this world, yet in the world to come; he lays it up among his treasures, and brings it forth at his pleasure. The word "wrath" is not in the text; it is not said what he reserves for the enemies of himself and church; it is inconceivable and inexpressible. <p>(u)  "dominus irae", Calvin, Vatablus, Grotius; "dominus excandescentiae", Piscator, Tarnovius; "dominus irae aestuantis, sive fervoris", Burkius. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/nahum/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">God <i>is</i> <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> jealous, and the LORD revengeth; the LORD revengeth, and <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> <i>is</i> furious; the LORD will take vengeance on his adversaries, and he reserveth <i>wrath</i> for his enemies.</span><p>(d) Meaning, of his glory.<p>(e) With his own he is but angry for a time, but his anger is never appeased toward the reprobate, even though he defers it for a time.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/nahum/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2</span>. <span class="ital">God is jealous</span>] The original order of words being retained:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>A jealous God and vengeful is Jehovah,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Jehovah is vengeful and wrathful;<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Jehovah is vengeful upon His adversaries,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And retaineth <span class="ital">wrath</span> against His enemies.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Jealousy” is the reaction of injured self-consciousness, it is God’s resentful self-assertion when He Himself, or that which is His, as His people or land, is too nearly touched; <a href="/context/deuteronomy/4-23.htm" title="Take heed to yourselves, lest you forget the covenant of the LORD your God, which he made with you, and make you a graven image, or the likeness of any thing, which the LORD your God has forbidden you....">Deuteronomy 4:23-24</a>; <a href="/joshua/24-19.htm" title="And Joshua said to the people, You cannot serve the LORD: for he is an holy God; he is a jealous God; he will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins.">Joshua 24:19</a>; <a href="/exodus/20-5.htm" title="You shall not bow down yourself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD your God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and fourth generation of them that hate me;">Exodus 20:5</a>; <a href="/exodus/34-14.htm" title="For you shall worship no other god: for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God:">Exodus 34:14</a>.

Arise, and call upon thy God; perhaps God (ha&#770;'e&#774;lo&#772;h&#305;&#772;m with the article, 'the true God') will think of us, that we may not perish." The meaning of &#1497;&#1514;&#1506;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1514; is disputed. As &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514; is used in <a href="/jeremiah/5-28.htm">Jeremiah 5:28</a> in the sense of shining (viz., of fat), Calvin and others (last of all, Hitzig) have maintained that the hithpael has the meaning, shown himself shining, i.e., bright (propitious); whilst others, including Jerome, prefer the meaning think again, which is apparently better supported than the former, not only by the Chaldee, but also by the nouns &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; (<a href="/job/12-5.htm">Job 12:5</a>) and &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1503; (<a href="/psalms/146-4.htm">Psalm 146:4</a>). God's thinking of a person involves the idea of active assistance. For the thought itself, compare <a href="/psalms/40-18.htm">Psalm 40:18</a>. The fact that Jonah obeyed this awakening call is passed over as self-evident; and in <a href="/jonah/1-7.htm">Jonah 1:7</a> the narrative proceeds to relate, that as the storm had not abated in the meantime, the sailors, firmly believing that some one in the ship had committed a crime which had excited the anger of God that was manifesting itself in the storm, had recourse to the lot to find out the culprit. &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;  equals  &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1500;&#1502;&#1497; (<a href="/jonah/1-8.htm">Jonah 1:8</a>), as &#1513;&#1473; is the vulgar, and in conversation the usual contraction for &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;: "on account of whom" (&#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, in this that  equals  because, or followed by &#1500;, on account of). &#1492;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492;, the misfortune (as in <a href="/amos/3-6.htm">Amos 3:6</a>), - namely, the storm which is threatening destruction. The lot fell upon Jonah. "The fugitive is taken by lot, not from any virtue in lots themselves, least of all the lots of heathen, but by the will of Him who governs uncertain lots" (Jerome).<p>When Jonah had been singled out by the lot as the culprit, the sailors called upon him to confess his guilt, asking him at the same time about his country, his occupation, and his parentage. The repetition of the question, on whose account this calamity had befallen them, which is omitted in the lxx (Vatic.), the Socin. prophets, and Cod. 195 of Kennicott, is found in the margin in Cod. 384, and is regarded by Grimm and Hitzig as a marginal gloss that has crept into the text. It is not superfluous, however; still less does it occasion any confusion; on the contrary, it is quite in order. The sailors wanted thereby to induce Jonah to confess with his own mouth that he was guilty, now that the lot had fallen upon him, and to disclose his crime (Ros. and others). As an indirect appeal to confess his crime, it prepares the way for the further inquiries as to his occupation, etc. They inquired about this occupation, because it might be a disreputable one, and one which excited the wrath of the gods; also about his parentage, and especially about the land and people from which he sprang, that they might be able to pronounce a safe sentence upon his crime. </body></html>
