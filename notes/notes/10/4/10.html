He may be sorry for the death of a person by which he is a gainer. These men shed innocent blood, from the basest motives. David justly executed vengeance upon them. He would not be beholden to any to help him by unlawful practices. God had helped him over many a difficulty, and through many a danger, therefore he depended upon him to crown and complete his own work. He speaks of his redemption from all adversity, as a thing done; though he had many storms yet before him, he knew that He who had delivered, would deliver.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>As though they would have fetched wheat - This is a very obscure passage, and the double repetition in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/4-6.htm">2 Samuel 4:6-7</a> of the murder of the king and of the escape of the assassin, is hard to account for. Rechab and Baanah came into the house under the pretence of getting grain, probably for the band which they commanded out of the king's storehouse, and so contrived to get access into the king's chamber; or, they found the wheat-carriers (the persons whose business it was to carry in grain for the king's household) just going into the king's house, and by joining them got into the midst of the house unnoticed. If the latter be the sense, the literal translation of the words would be: "And behold (or, and there) there came into the midst of the house the carriers of wheat, and they (i. e. Rechab and Baanah) smote him, etc." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2Sa 4:10-12.

No more is related, not that he killed him, or assisted in killing him, only that he was dead; by which it appears, as Abarbinel thinks, that the Amalekite did not slay Saul, and that David did not put him to death on that account, but for what follows: <p>thinking to have brought good tidings; which would have been very acceptable to David, that he would have rejoiced and exulted at it as he did; but he was mistaken; instead of that, <p>I took hold of him, and slew him at Ziklag; that is, ordered one of his young men to lay hold on him, and slay him, as he did, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-15.htm">2 Samuel 1:15</a>, <p>who thought that I would have given him a reward for his tidings; a handsome present, as the Targum here, a gift, or raised him to some post of honour and profit. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_samuel/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">When one told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead, thinking to have brought good tidings, I took hold of him, and slew him in Ziklag, who thought that I would have given him a reward for his tidings:</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/2_samuel/4.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">10</span>. <span class="ital">when one told me</span>, &c.] The Amalekite who pretended to have slain Saul (ch. <a href="/2_samuel/1-2.htm" title="It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth on his head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.">2 Samuel 1:2</a> ff.).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">slew him … who</span> thought <span class="ital">that I would have given him</span>] Or, <span class="bld">slew him … to give him a reward</span>, &c.

He was a son of Jonathan, smitten (i.e., lamed) in his feet. He was five years old when the tidings came from Jezreel of Saul and Jonathan, i.e., of their death. His nurse immediately took him and fled, and on their hasty flight he fell and became lame. His name was Mephibosheth (according to Simonis, for &#1489;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514; &#1502;&#1508;&#1488;&#1492;, destroying the idol); but in <a href="/1_chronicles/8-34.htm">1 Chronicles 8:34</a> and <a href="/1_chronicles/9-40.htm">1 Chronicles 9:40</a> he is called Meribbaal (Baal's fighter), just as Ishbosheth is also called Eshbaal (see at <a href="/2_samuel/2-8.htm">2 Samuel 2:8</a>).
