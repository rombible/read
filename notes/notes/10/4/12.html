It may be questioned whether they were actuated by higher motives than “the traditional policy of rulers, who thus provide that they shall be protected for the present, and afterwards avenged” (Tac. <span class="ital">Hist.</span> I. 44), but David’s indignation was doubtless sincere.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">cut off their hands and their feet</span>] The hands which had been stretched out against their master, the feet which had been “swift to shed blood” and to seek reward, were exposed to view in the most public and frequented spot in Hebron, for a spectacle and a warning. Cp. <a href="/deuteronomy/21-22.htm" title="And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be to be put to death, and you hang him on a tree:">Deuteronomy 21:22</a>.

The hands were cut off because they had committed the murder; the feet, because they had brought the head to Hebron. Still, David was violating the spirit of the Mosaic Law. It ordered that the body of a man who had been put to death should be buried the same day (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-23.htm">Deuteronomy 21:23</a>). In the face of this humane enactment, it is wonderful that the laws of Christian countries should have allowed the mutilation of the bodies of traitors, and the hanging on gibbets of criminals convicted of smaller crimes. Remembering, therefore, the customs of our fathers, we must not blame David much for suspending the bands and feet of these murderers at the pool of Hebron, that all, when coming for water, might know of their punishment. The head of Ishbosheth was honourably buried in Abner's grave (see <a href="/2_samuel/3-32.htm">2 Samuel 3:32</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"And here they had come into the midst of the house, fetching wheat (i.e., under the pretext of fetching wheat, probably for the soldiers in their companies), and smote him in the abdomen; and Rechab and his brother escaped." The first clause in this verse is a circumstantial clause, which furnishes the explanation of the way in which it was possible for the murderers to find their way to the king. The second clause continues the narrative, and &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; is attached to &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1489;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; (<a href="/2_samuel/4-5.htm">2 Samuel 4:5</a>).<p>(Note: The lxx thought it desirable to explain the possibility of Rechab and Baanah getting into the king's house, and therefore paraphrased the sixth verse as follows: &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b9;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b5; &#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x3b5; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3a1;&#788;&#x3b7;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3b2; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x392;&#x3b1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; ("and behold the doorkeeper of the house was cleaning wheat, and nodded and slept. And Rahab and Baana the brothers escaped, or went in secretly"). The first part of this paraphrase has been retained in the Vulgate, in the interpolation between <a href="/2_samuel/4-5.htm">2 Samuel 4:5</a> and <a href="/2_samuel/4-6.htm">2 Samuel 4:6</a> : et ostiaria domus purgans triticum obdormivit; whether it was copied by Jerome from the Itala, or was afterwards introduced as a gloss into his translation. It is very evident that this clause in the Vulgate is only a gloss, from the fact that, in all the rest of <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/4-6.htm">2 Samuel 4:6</a>, Jerome has closely followed the Masoretic text, and that none of the other ancient translators found anything about a doorkeeper in his text. When Thenius, therefore, attempts to prove the "evident corruption of the Masoretic text," by appealing to the "nonsense (Unsinn) of relating the murder of Ishbosheth and the flight of the murderers twice over, and in two successive verses (see <a href="/2_samuel/4-7.htm">2 Samuel 4:7</a>)," he is altogether wrong in speaking of the repetition as "nonsense" whereas it is simply tautology, and has measured the peculiarities of Hebrew historians by the standard adopted by our own. J. P. F. Knigsfeldt has given the true explanation when he says: "The Hebrews often repeat in this way, for the purpose of adding something fresh, as for example, in this instance, their carrying off the head." Comp. with this <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-22.htm">2 Samuel 3:22-23</a>, where the arrival of Joab is mentioned twice, viz., in two successive verses; or <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-1.htm">2 Samuel 5:1-3</a>, where the assembling of the tribes of Israel at Hebron is also referred to a second time, - a repetition at which Thenius himself has taken no offence, - and many other passages of the same kind.)  </body></html>
