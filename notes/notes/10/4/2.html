From <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/9-17.htm">Joshua 9:17</a>, it might have been expected that the population of Beeroth would be Canaanite. But from some unknown cause the Canaanite inhabitants of Beeroth had fled to Gittaim - perhaps the same as Gath - and continued there as sojourners. If this flight of the Beerothites took place at the time of Saul's cruel attack upon the Gibeonites <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-1.htm">2 Samuel 21:1-2</a>, Baanah and Reehab may have been native Beerothites, and have been instigated to murder the son of Saul by a desire to avenge the blood of their countrymen. The fact of their being reckoned as Benjamites is quite compatible with their being Canaanites by blood. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 4<p>2Sa 4:1, 2.

Beeroth was one of the four Gibeonite cities, retained by their original Canaanite inhabitants in virtue of the treaty made with Joshua (<a href="/joshua/9-17.htm" title="And the children of Israel journeyed, and came to their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, and Chephirah, and Beeroth, and Kirjathjearim.">Joshua 9:17</a>). It was however reckoned to belong to the tribe of Benjamin (<a href="/joshua/18-25.htm" title="Gibeon, and Ramah, and Beeroth,">Joshua 18:25</a>), and had been occupied by Benjamites when its original inhabitants deserted it. When and why they did so is unknown, but it has been plausibly conjectured that they fled from Saul’s massacre of the Gibeonites (<a href="/context/2_samuel/21-1.htm" title="Then there was a famine in the days of David three years, year after year; and David inquired of the LORD. And the LORD answered, It is for Saul, and for his bloody house, because he slew the Gibeonites....">2 Samuel 21:1-2</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The site of Beeroth (=<span class="ital">wells</span>) is probably marked by the modern village of <span class="ital">El-Bireh</span> (=<span class="ital">the well</span>), about 9 miles N. of Jerusalem. “It is remarkable as the first halting-place of caravans on the northern road from Jerusalem, and therefore not improbably the scene of the event to which its monastic tradition lays claim—the place where the parents of Jesus sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance, and when they found him not, turned back again to Jerusalem.” Stanley, <span class="ital">Sinai and Pal.</span> p. 213.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Saul's son had two men captains of bands.</span> The bands mentioned were light-armed troops, used in forays, such as that  mentioned in <a href="/2_samuel/3-22.htm">2 Samuel 3:22</a>. Their captains would be men of importance with Ishbosheth, who is here described somewhat contemptuously, not as king, nor by his own name, but as "Saul's son." <span class="cmt_word">Beeroth</span>. This place, literally <span class="accented">the Wells</span>, was one of the four towns reserved for the Gibeonites (<a href="/joshua/9-17.htm">Joshua 9:17</a>), though nominally belonging to Benjamin (<a href="/joshua/18-25.htm">Joshua 18:25</a>). The note, that it <span class="cmt_word">was reckoned to Benjamin,</span> suggests that it had until quite lately been occupied by the Canaanites, whose flight to Gittaim had no doubt been caused by Saul's cruel attack upon them referred to in <a href="/2_samuel/21-1.htm">2 Samuel 21:1, 2</a>. It was thus remarkable that the destruction of Saul's dynasty was the work of the Gibeonites of Beeroth. As we find another of these Beerothites, Naharai, holding the office of armour bearer to Joab (<a href="/1_chronicles/11-39.htm">1 Chronicles 11:39</a>), it seems probable that many of them saved themselves from expulsion by becoming soldiers. But among David's worthies a large number were strangers, and some even men of foreign extraction. Beeroth, however, was probably seized in Saul's reign by the Benjamites, by force, and occupied by them, as its citizens returned in large numbers from the exile (<a href="/ezra/2-25.htm">Ezra 2:25</a>), and are counted as genuine Israelites. Moreover, by thus dispossessing the natives, Saul was able to give his tribesmen "fields and vineyards" (<a href="/1_samuel/22-7.htm">1 Samuel 22:7</a>), which otherwise would have been in violation of the Mosaic Law. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>But David mourned so bitterly, that when all the people called upon him to take some food during the day, he declared with an oath that he would not taste bread or anything else before the setting of the sun. &#1500;&#1495;&#1501; &#1492;&#1489;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; does not mean, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-5.htm">2 Samuel 13:5</a>, to give to eat, on account of the expression "all the people," as it can hardly be imagined that all the people, i.e., all who were present, could have come to bring David food, but it signifies to make him eat, i.e., call upon him to eat; whilst it is left uncertain whether David was to eat with the people (cf. <a href="/2_samuel/12-17.htm">2 Samuel 12:17</a>), i.e., to take part in the funeral meal that was held after the burial, or whether the people simply urged him to take some food, for the purpose of soothing his own sorrow. &#1488;&#1501; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; are to be taken separately: &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;, introducing the oath, and &#1488;&#1501; being the particle used in an oath: "if," i.e., assuredly not.</body></html>
