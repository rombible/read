Hadarezer sent and brought out the Syrians that were beyond the river&#8212;This prince had enjoyed a breathing time after his defeat (2Sa 8:3). But alarmed at the increasing power and greatness of David, as well as being an ally of the Ammonites, he levied a vast army not only in Syria, but in Mesopotamia, to invade the Hebrew kingdom. Shobach, his general, in pursuance of this design, had marched his troops as far as Kelam, a border town of eastern Manasseh, when David, crossing the Jordan by forced marches, suddenly surprised, defeated, and dispersed them. As a result of this great and decisive victory, all the petty kingdoms of Syria submitted and became his tributaries (see on [272]1Ch 19:1).   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">All Israel, </span> i.e. the chosen and valiant men picked out of all Israel. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And when it was told David,....

Really it was a matter of course that in so great a war the king should place himself at the head of his levies. For not only was he possessed of great military genius, but his personal presence would make the men of Israel, a race of sturdy free men, assemble in greater numbers, and would give them confidence. If David himself went there would be no shirking the war and finding excuses to stay at home, and in the camp there would be prompt alacrity and zeal. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When Joab saw that "the front of the war was (directed) against him both before and behind," he selected a picked body out of the Israelitish army, and posted them (the picked men) against the children of Aram (i.e., the Syrians). The rest of the men he gave to his brother Abishai, and stationed them against the Ammonites. "The front of the battle:" i.e., the face or front of the hostile army, when placed in battle array. Joab had this in front and behind, as the Ammonites had taken their stand before Rabbah at the back of the Israelitish army, and the Syrians by Medeba in their front, so that Joab was attacked both before and behind. This compelled him to divide his army. He chose out, i.e., made a selection. Instead of &#1489;&#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500; &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497; (the picked men in Israel) the Chronicles have &#1489;&#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500; &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; (the men in Israel), the singular &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; being more commonly employed than the plural to denote the men of war. The &#1489;&#1468; before &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500; is not to be regarded as suspicious, although the early translators have not expressed it, and the Masoretes wanted to expunge it. "The choice of Israel" signifies those who were selected in Israel for the war, i.e., the Israelitish soldiers. Joab himself took up his station opposite to the Syrians with a picked body of men, because they were the stronger force of the two. He then made this arrangement with Abishai (<a href="/2_samuel/10-11.htm">2 Samuel 10:11</a>): "If Aram becomes stronger than I((i.e., overpowers me), come to my help; and if the Ammonites should overpower thee, I will go to help thee." Consequently the attack was not to be made upon both the armies of the enemy simultaneously; but Joab proposed to attack the Aramaeans (Syrians) first (cf. <a href="/2_samuel/10-13.htm">2 Samuel 10:13</a>), and Abishai was merely to keep the Ammonites in check, though there was still a possibility that the two bodies of the enemy might make their attack simultaneously.</body></html>
