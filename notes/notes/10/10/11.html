God has forces to send against those that set his wrath at defiance, Isa 5:19, which will convince them that none ever hardened his heart against God, and prospered. Christ's soldiers should strengthen one another's hands in their spiritual warfare. Let nothing be wanting in us, whatever the success be. When we make conscience of doing our duty, we may, with satisfaction, leave the event with God, assuredly hoping for his salvation in his own way and time.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The two armies of the Ammonites and the Syrians were drawn up facing one another; the Ammonites supported by the city Rabbah behind them; the Syrians in great force, with numerous chariots able to manoeuvre in the plain in front of Medeba.

The Ammonites Overcome.<p>6-14. when the children of Ammon saw that they stank before David&#8212;To chastise those insolent and inhospitable Ammonites, who had violated the common law of nations, David sent a large army under the command of Joab, while they, informed of the impending attack, made energetic preparations to repel it by engaging the services of an immense number of Syrian mercenaries.<p>Beth-rehob&#8212;the capital of the low-lying region between Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon.<p>Zoba&#8212;(see on [271]2Sa 8:3).<p>of king Maacah&#8212;His territories lay on the other side of Jordan, near Gilead (De 3:14).<p>Ish-tob&#8212;that is, "the men of Tob"&#8212;the place of Jephthah's marauding adventures (see also 1Ch 19:6; Ps 60:1, title). As the Israelite soldiers poured into the Ammonite territory, that people met them at the frontier town of Medeba (1Ch 19:7-9), the native troops covering the city, while the Syrian mercenaries lay at some distance encamped in the fields. In making the attack, Joab divided his forces into two separate detachments&#8212;the one of which, under the command of his brother, Abishai, was to concentrate its attack upon the city, while he himself marched against the overwhelming host of mercenary auxiliaries. It was a just and necessary war that had been forced on Israel, and they could hope for the blessing of God upon their arms. With great judgment the battle opened against the mercenaries, who could not stand against the furious onset of Joab, and not feeling the cause their own, consulted their safety by flight. The Ammonites, who had placed their chief dependence upon a foreign aid, then retreated to entrench themselves within the walls of the town.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he said, if the Syrians be too strong for me,....

Joab recognized the full danger of their situation; for should he meet with any check in his attack on this vast host of mercenaries, he was well aware that the Ammonites, watching the battle with eager interest, would, on the first news of victory, rush upon Abishai with exulting fury; and the men with him, being only ordinary troops, would be disheartened by Joab's failure, so that without extraordinary bravery on their leader's part, they would give way, and all would be lost. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When David received information of the insults that had been heaped upon his ambassadors, he sent messengers to meet them, and direct them to remain in Jericho until their beard had grown again, that he might not have to set his eyes upon the insult they had received. </body></html>
