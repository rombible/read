David here remembers the ancient benefits which he had received from Nahash, and pitied his son, who had lost such a father. What those benefits were is uncertain. It is probable, however, that, being an enemy to Saul, who had given him a great overthrow, he proved a friend to David when he was persecuted by him, sent him relief and assistance, and perhaps offered him his protection. <span class="ital">David sent to comfort him — </span>According to the present custom among princes, who send some of their courtiers to condole with those, under any loss or suffering, with whom they live in friendship. And as, it appears, there had hitherto been friendship between David and him, we must conclude that what is said of the spoils of the children of Ammon, <a href="/2_samuel/8-12.htm" title="Of Syria, and of Moab, and of the children of Ammon, and of the Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer, son of Rehob, king of Zobah.">2 Samuel 8:12</a>, is mentioned by way of anticipation, and is to be understood of the spoils taken after the victory spoken of in this chapter.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:1-5 Nahash had been an enemy to Israel, yet had showed kindness to David. David therefore resolves gratefully to return it. If a Pharisee gives alms in pride, though God will not reward it, yet he that receives the alms ought to return thanks for it. Those who bear ill-will to their neighbours, are resolved not to believe that their neighbours bear any good-will to them. There is nothing so well meant, but it may be ill interpreted, and is wont to be so, by men who love nobody but themselves. The best men must not think it strange if they are thus misrepresented. Charity thinketh no evil. According to the usages of those days and countries, Hanun treated David's ambassadors in the most contemptuous manner. David showed much concern for his servants. Let us learn not to lay unjust reproaches to heart; they will wear off, and turn only to the shame of those who utter or do them; while the reputation wrongfully hurt in a little time grows again, as these beards did.

Then said David, I will show kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, as his father showed kindness unto me&#8212;It is probable that this was the Nahash against whom Saul waged war at Jabesh-gilead (1Sa 11:11). David, on leaving Gath, where his life was exposed to danger, found an asylum with the king of Moab; and as Nahash, king of the Ammonites, was his nearest neighbor, it may be that during the feud between Saul and David, he, through enmity to the former, was kind and hospitable to David.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Therefore there had hitherto been peace and friendship between David and him; and therefore <span class="ital">the spoils of the children of Ammon</span> are mentioned <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/2_samuel/8-12.htm" title="Of Syria, and of Moab, and of the children of Ammon, and of the Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer, son of Rehob, king of Zobah.">2 Samuel 8:12</a></span>, by way of anticipation, and with respect to the story here following. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">As his father showed kindness unto me; </span> which he might do either by offering him his help, if he needed it; or by supplying him with military or other provisions upon occasion, or many other ways. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then said David, I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash,....

The smart of the defeat caused by Saul's energy would make him regard with friendship any one who was a thorn in the side of the man who had so unexpectedly stopped him in his career, and hence his kindness to David. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>David then summoned Ziba the servant of Saul, told him of the restoration of Saul's possessions to his son Mephibosheth, and ordered him, with his sons and servants, to cultivate the land for the son of his lord. The words, "that thy master's son may have food to eat," are not at variance with the next clause, "Mephibosheth shall eat bread alway at my table," as bread is a general expression, including all the necessaries of life. Although Mephibosheth himself ate daily as a guest at the king's table, he had to make provision as a royal prince for the maintenance of his own family and servants, as he had children according to <a href="/2_samuel/9-12.htm">2 Samuel 9:12</a> and <a href="/1_chronicles/8-34.htm">1 Chronicles 8:34</a>. Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants (<a href="/2_samuel/9-10.htm">2 Samuel 9:10</a>), with whom he had probably been living in Gibeah, Saul's native place, and may perhaps have hitherto farmed Saul's land. </body></html>
