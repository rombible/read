Wonderful to reflect on! kingdoms and vast tracts of country, which were promised by God, ages before, to the posterity of a man who had not one foot of property in them, we see here all falling, with a very particular exactness, under the dominion of one of the posterity of him to whom they had been promised! So faithful is God, and all his purposes will be fulfilled! Thus, in the space of nineteen or twenty years, David had the happiness of finishing gloriously eight wars, all righteously undertaken, and all honourably terminated; namely, 1st, The civil war with Ish-bosheth: 2d, The war against the Jebusites: 3d, Against the Philistines and their allies: 4th, Against the Philistines alone: 5th, Against the Moabites: 6th, Against Hadadezer: 7th, Against the Idumeans: 8th, Against the Ammonites and Syrians. We shall soon see this last entirely completed, by the conquest of the kingdom of the Ammonites, abandoned by their allies. What glory for the monarch of Israel, had not the splendour of this illustrious epocha been obscured by a complication of crimes, of which one could never have even suspected him!

But now the promise made to Abraham, Ge 15:18, and repeated to Joshua, Jos 1:4, that the borders of Israel should extend to the river Euphrates, was performed.

Hadarezer sent and brought out the Syrians that were beyond the river&#8212;This prince had enjoyed a breathing time after his defeat (2Sa 8:3). But alarmed at the increasing power and greatness of David, as well as being an ally of the Ammonites, he levied a vast army not only in Syria, but in Mesopotamia, to invade the Hebrew kingdom. Shobach, his general, in pursuance of this design, had marched his troops as far as Kelam, a border town of eastern Manasseh, when David, crossing the Jordan by forced marches, suddenly surprised, defeated, and dispersed them. As a result of this great and decisive victory, all the petty kingdoms of Syria submitted and became his tributaries (see on [272]1Ch 19:1).   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The kings that were servants to Hadarezer, </span> to wit, for that time, or in that expedition to which he hired them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And when all the kings that were servants to Hadarezer,....

The wars with Damascus and Edom, mentioned in <a href="/2_samuel/8-5.htm">2 Samuel 8:5, 13</a>, probably followed immediately upon Hadarezer's defeat, but are not referred to here, as the interest now centres in David's personal conduct. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Joab then advanced with his army to battle against Aram, and "they fled before him." - <a href="/2_samuel/10-14.htm">2 Samuel 10:14</a>.
