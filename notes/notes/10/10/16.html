Hadarezer sent and brought out the Syrians that were beyond the river&#8212;This prince had enjoyed a breathing time after his defeat (2Sa 8:3). But alarmed at the increasing power and greatness of David, as well as being an ally of the Ammonites, he levied a vast army not only in Syria, but in Mesopotamia, to invade the Hebrew kingdom. Shobach, his general, in pursuance of this design, had marched his troops as far as Kelam, a border town of eastern Manasseh, when David, crossing the Jordan by forced marches, suddenly surprised, defeated, and dispersed them. As a result of this great and decisive victory, all the petty kingdoms of Syria submitted and became his tributaries (see on [272]1Ch 19:1).   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Hadarezer; </span> the same with <span class="ital">Hadadezer</span>, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/2_samuel/8-3.htm" title="David smote also Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to recover his border at the river Euphrates.">2 Samuel 8:3</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The Syrians that were beyond the river; </span> who having engaged themselves in the former expedition, as was noted before, were now obliged to proceed in their own defence, being also persuaded and hired to this second expedition, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/2_samuel/10-19.htm" title="And when all the kings that were servants to Hadarezer saw that they were smitten before Israel, they made peace with Israel, and served them.

Hadarezer probably had been well content to let his subjects receive the pay of the Ammonites, and extend his empire at their cost. But as paramount king in Aram, the defeat of the mercenaries obliged him to make the war a national affair, and undertake the management of it himself. He therefore summons troops from all the Aramean states on both sides of the Euphrates, and places his own general, Shobach, in command, and makes Helam the place of gathering. <span class="cmt_word">Helam</span>. No such place is known, and the word might mean "their army," in which case the translation would be, "and they came in full force." The Vulgate takes it in this way, but makes the verb the causative singular, and translates, "and he brought their army." On the other hand, the LXX., the Syriac, and the Chaldee make it a proper name here, as even the Vulgate necessarily does in ver. 17, where there can be no doubt. In the parallel place (<a href="/1_chronicles/19-16.htm">1 Chronicles 19:16, 17</a>) it is omitted in the first place, and in the second we find in its stead, "upon them." Either, therefore, the chronicler did not know of such a place, or the text is corrupt. Ewald and others suppose that Helam may be identified with Alamata; but we learn from <a href="/1_chronicles/18-3.htm">1 Chronicles 18:3</a> that the battle was fought near Hamath, and Alamata is on the Euphrates, too far away for David to have made his attack there. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When Joab saw that "the front of the war was (directed) against him both before and behind," he selected a picked body out of the Israelitish army, and posted them (the picked men) against the children of Aram (i.e., the Syrians). The rest of the men he gave to his brother Abishai, and stationed them against the Ammonites. "The front of the battle:" i.e., the face or front of the hostile army, when placed in battle array. Joab had this in front and behind, as the Ammonites had taken their stand before Rabbah at the back of the Israelitish army, and the Syrians by Medeba in their front, so that Joab was attacked both before and behind. This compelled him to divide his army. He chose out, i.e., made a selection. Instead of &#1489;&#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500; &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497; (the picked men in Israel) the Chronicles have &#1489;&#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500; &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; (the men in Israel), the singular &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; being more commonly employed than the plural to denote the men of war. The &#1489;&#1468; before &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500; is not to be regarded as suspicious, although the early translators have not expressed it, and the Masoretes wanted to expunge it. "The choice of Israel" signifies those who were selected in Israel for the war, i.e., the Israelitish soldiers. Joab himself took up his station opposite to the Syrians with a picked body of men, because they were the stronger force of the two. He then made this arrangement with Abishai (<a href="/2_samuel/10-11.htm">2 Samuel 10:11</a>): "If Aram becomes stronger than I((i.e., overpowers me), come to my help; and if the Ammonites should overpower thee, I will go to help thee." Consequently the attack was not to be made upon both the armies of the enemy simultaneously; but Joab proposed to attack the Aramaeans (Syrians) first (cf. <a href="/2_samuel/10-13.htm">2 Samuel 10:13</a>), and Abishai was merely to keep the Ammonites in check, though there was still a possibility that the two bodies of the enemy might make their attack simultaneously.</body></html>
