The Ammonites Overcome.<p>6-14. when the children of Ammon saw that they stank before David&#8212;To chastise those insolent and inhospitable Ammonites, who had violated the common law of nations, David sent a large army under the command of Joab, while they, informed of the impending attack, made energetic preparations to repel it by engaging the services of an immense number of Syrian mercenaries.<p>Beth-rehob&#8212;the capital of the low-lying region between Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon.<p>Zoba&#8212;(see on [271]2Sa 8:3).<p>of king Maacah&#8212;His territories lay on the other side of Jordan, near Gilead (De 3:14).<p>Ish-tob&#8212;that is, "the men of Tob"&#8212;the place of Jephthah's marauding adventures (see also 1Ch 19:6; Ps 60:1, title).

In making the attack, Joab divided his forces into two separate detachments&#8212;the one of which, under the command of his brother, Abishai, was to concentrate its attack upon the city, while he himself marched against the overwhelming host of mercenary auxiliaries. It was a just and necessary war that had been forced on Israel, and they could hope for the blessing of God upon their arms. With great judgment the battle opened against the mercenaries, who could not stand against the furious onset of Joab, and not feeling the cause their own, consulted their safety by flight. The Ammonites, who had placed their chief dependence upon a foreign aid, then retreated to entrench themselves within the walls of the town.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Beth-rehob, </span> near Hamath, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/numbers/13-21.htm" title="So they went up, and searched the land from the wilderness of Zin to Rehob, as men come to Hamath.">Numbers 13:21</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Zoba; </span> of which see <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/1_samuel/14-47.htm" title="So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines: and wherever he turned himself, he vexed them.">1 Samuel 14:47</a> <a href="/2_samuel/8-3.htm" title="David smote also Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to recover his border at the river Euphrates.">2 Samuel 8:3</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Of king Maacah, </span> i. e. of that part of Syria which was under king Maacah; for Syria was a large country, and there were divers kings in the several parts of it.

See <a href="/1_kings/10-26.htm" title="And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he bestowed in the cities for chariots, and with the king at Jerusalem.">1 Kings 10:26</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/12-3.htm" title="With twelve hundred chariots, and three score thousand horsemen: and the people were without number that came with him out of Egypt; the Lubims, the Sukkiims, and the Ethiopians.">2 Chronicles 12:3</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/14-9.htm" title="And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an host of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and came to Mareshah.">2 Chronicles 14:9</a>. The text of Samuel also seems to be defective, as the force doubtless had some cavalry and chariots and did not consist of infantry only.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That they stank</span> (see notes on 1 Samuel 13:4; 27:12). As the Hebrew literally means, <span class="accented">had made themselves stink</span>, the Revised Version rightly translates "had made themselves odious." <span class="cmt_word">The children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians.</span> From <a href="/1_chronicles/19-6.htm">1 Chronicles 19:6</a> we learn that his mercenaries from Aram cost Hanun a thousand talents of silver, or nearly five hundred thousand pounds - a vast sum, especially considering the great relative value of silver in those days. The mercenaries, moreover, were gathered out of numerous districts of Aram - from Rehob, Zoba, Beth-Maacah, and Tob; the margin being right in rendering "the men of Tob," instead of "Ish-tob." So, too, the Revised Version, "The men of Tob twelve thousand men." It was to this land that Jephthah fled (<a href="/judges/11-3.htm">Judges 11:3</a>). The whole number of the allies was thirty-three thousand, with which total the parallel place agrees, as they are described there as "thirty-two thousand, and the King of Maacah and his people," who are here said to have been a thousand strong. The text, however, there must be corrupt, as it describes them all as horsemen (Authorized Version, "chariots;" <a href="/1_chronicles/19-7.htm">1 Chronicles 19:7</a>); here footmen only are mentioned, with which the narrative agrees (see note on ver. 18). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Ziba promised to obey the king's command. The last clause of this verse is a circumstantial clause in form, with which the writer passes over to the conclusion of his account. But the words &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495;&#1504;&#1497; &#1506;&#1500; &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495;&#1503;, "at my table," do not tally with this, as they require that the words should be taken as David's own. This is precluded, however, not only by the omission of any intimation that David spoke again after Ziba, and repeated what he had said once already, and that without any occasion whatever, but also by the form of the sentence, more especially the participle &#1488;&#1499;&#1500;. There is no other course left, therefore, than to regard &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495;&#1504;&#1497; (my table) as written by mistake for &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1491; &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495;&#1503;: "but Mephibosheth ate at David's table as one of the king's sons." The further notices in <a href="/2_samuel/9-12.htm">2 Samuel 9:12</a> and <a href="/2_samuel/9-13.htm">2 Samuel 9:13</a> follow this in a very simple manner. &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; &#1502;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;, "all the dwelling," i.e., all the inhabitants of Ziba's house, namely his sons and servants, were servants of Mephibosheth, i.e., worked for him and cultivated his land, whilst he himself took up his abode at Jerusalem, to eat daily at the king's table, although he was lamed in both his feet. </body></html>
