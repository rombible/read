In this, then, may be a taunt to the Benjamites on account of the partiality shown them by Saul. On the other hand, the Israelites urge their claim of numerical superiority.

The procession began as soon as Amasa had brought the Judahite escort, and the preference given to this tribe produced a bitter jealousy, which was nearly kindling a civil war fiercer than that which had just ended. A war of words ensued between the tribes&#8212;Israel resting their argument on their superior numbers; "they had ten parts in the king," whereas Judah had no more than one. Judah grounded their right to take the lead, on the ground of their nearer relationship to the king. This was a claim dangerous to the house of David; and it shows the seeds were already sown for that tribal dissension which, before long, led to the dismemberment of the kingdom.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/19.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Near of kin to us; </span> of the same tribe with us, and therefore both oweth the more respect to us, and might expect and challenge more respect from us.
