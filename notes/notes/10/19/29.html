And Ziba said, I humbly beseech you that I may find grace in your sight, my lord, O king.">2Samuel 16:4</a>); he now saw the injustice of his hasty action, and ought at least to have reversed it, if not to have punished Ziba besides. Either, however, because he had still some doubt of the real merits of the case, or more probably because he was unwilling for political reasons to offend Ziba, he resorts to that halfway and compromise course which was both weak and unjust. The circumstances of the case, the continued mourning of Mephibosheth, the silence of Ziba, concur with the physical infirmity of Mephibosheth to show the truth of his story.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/2_samuel/19.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/2_samuel/19-29.htm" title="And the king said to him, Why speak you any more of your matters?

Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.">2 Samuel 9:10</a>; he and his sons managing it, and supporting themselves out of it, as they did before, and giving the rest of the profits thereof to thee. It is easy to perceive, from this answer of David, that he saw Mephibosheth’s innocence, and the error of his former credulity, and therefore could not bear to hear of it. But he had now no time to discuss the matter more fully: and, therefore, all that he could do for the present was to restore him to his estate, and leave both him and his accuser in their former condition, till he could inquire further. However Ziba might have been faulty toward Mephibosheth, he had been signally faithful and useful to David; and to condemn him unheard, as he had Mephibosheth, was to run the risk of a second rash decision; a decision that might be now as unseasonable as rash, while any rebellion subsisted in his dominions.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/19.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>19:24-30 David recalls the forfeiture of Mephibosheth's estate; and he expressed joy for the king's return.

Mephibosheth &#8230; came down to meet the king&#8212;The reception given to Mephibosheth was less creditable to David. The sincerity of that prince's grief for the misfortunes of the king cannot be doubted.<p>He had neither dressed his feet&#8212;not taken the bath,<p>nor trimmed his beard&#8212;The Hebrews cut off the hair on the upper lip (see on [277]Le 13:45), and cheeks, but carefully cherished it on the chin from ear to ear. Besides dyeing it black or red colors, which, however, is the exception, and not the rule in the East, there are various modes of trimming it: they train it into a massy, bushy form, swelling and round; or they terminate it like a pyramid, in a sharp point. Whatever the mode, it is always trimmed with the greatest care; and they usually carry a small comb for the purpose. The neglect of this attention to his beard was an undoubted proof of the depth of Mephibosheth's grief. The king seems to have received him upbraidingly, and not to have been altogether sure either of his guilt or innocence. It is impossible to commend the cavalier treatment, any more than to approve the partial award, of David in this case. If he were too hurried and distracted by the pressure of circumstances to inquire fully into the matter, he should have postponed his decision; for if by "dividing the land" (2Sa 19:29) he meant that the former arrangement should be continued by which Mephibosheth was acknowledged the proprietor, and Ziba the farmer, it was a hardship inflicted on the owner to fix him with a tenant who had so grossly slandered him. But if by "dividing the land," they were now to share alike, the injustice of the decision was greatly increased. In any view, the generous, disinterested spirit displayed by Mephibosheth was worthy a son of the noble-hearted Jonathan.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/19.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Why speakest thou any more of thy matters?</span> For as Ziba was present, so doubtless he was not silent, but said and did what he could to make good his former charge; which must needs occasion many words before the king. And the king was not now at leisure for long debates, and therefore makes an end of the matter. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I have said, </span> to wit, within myself; I have considered the matter as far as now I can, and upon the whole am come to this resolution, wherein I expect that thou and he do both acquiesce. Or, <span class="ital">I do now say</span>; I pronounce this sentence in the cause. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Thou and Ziba divide the land:</span> the meaning is either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. The land shall be divided between thee and him, as it was by my first order, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/2_samuel/9-10.htm" title="You therefore, and your sons, and your servants, shall till the land for him, and you shall bring in the fruits, that your master's son may have food to eat: but Mephibosheth your master's son shall eat bread always at my table.

And to this the following words may well enough be accommodated, Yea, let him take all, to wit, to his own sole use. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Or, 2. The right and profits of the land shall be equally divided between you. It seems a very rash and harsh sentence, and very unbecoming David’s wisdom, and justice, and gratitude to Jonathan; and Ziba seems to have deserved death for falsely accusing his master of treason, rather than a recompence. But the whole transaction of the matter is not here set down. Possibly Ziba might bring plausible pretences to justify his accusation; and it might be pretended that Mephibosheth neglected the trimming and dressing himself only in policy, and that for a season, till David and his family had destroyed one another by their civil wars, and given him a fit opportunity to take the crown. So that David might really be at a loss what to determine. And Ziba had given proof of his affections to David by an act of kindness which could not be without hazard to himself, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/2_samuel/16-1.htm" title="And when David was a little past the top of the hill, behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of asses saddled, and on them two hundred loaves of bread, and an hundred bunches of raisins, and an hundred of summer fruits, and a bottle of wine.">2 Samuel 16:1</a>,2</span>, which Mephibosheth had not done. And possibly this was only a present sentence, and David resolved to examine things more thoroughly when he had more leisure, and then to make a more full and final determination of the business; which also he might do, though it be not here recorded; for we must not think that nothing was done and said about such things but what is mentioned in Scripture. Besides, Ziba being a powerful man, and the crown not yet firmly fixed upon the king’s head, David might think fit to suspend his final sentence till a more convenient season, and not now to provoke him too much by taking away all his estate from him at once, but to proceed against him by degrees. Howsoever, this is certain, we cannot pass a right judgment upon this action of David’s, unless we understood all the circumstances of it, which we cannot pretend to do. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/19.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the king said unto him, why speakest thou any more of thy matters?.... Of his father's family, and the injuries done by them to David, and of the benefits and favours which he had received from David, or of his temporal affairs, of his estate, which David had given away to Ziba: <p>I have said, thou and Ziba divide the land; revoking his last grant to Ziba, which gave him all that belonged to Mephibosheth, <a href="/2_samuel/16-4.htm">2 Samuel 16:4</a>; he established his first decree, that Ziba should have half the profit of the land for tilling it, and the other half be given to Mephibosheth; he did not choose to punish Ziba for slandering his master, being inclined to clemency and mercy, and determined to show no severity at that time; and might be in some fear of Ziba, being a considerable man, lest he should raise a new insurrection, if he bore hard upon him; besides, he might have a large share in his affection, having made a present to him in the time of his distress, and was one of the first that came to meet him upon his return, <a href="/2_samuel/19-17.htm">2 Samuel 19:17</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_samuel/19.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the king said unto him, Why speakest thou any more of thy matters?

And Ziba said, I humbly beseech you that I may find grace in your sight, my lord, O king.">2 Samuel 16:4</a>). But it may be a confirmation of the original arrangement by which Ziba was to be Mephibosheth’s tenant, and as he certainly did not cultivate the land for nothing, might be said to share it with him.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou and Ziba divide the land.</span> Two views are taken of this decision - the one, that it was a complete reversal of the command in <a href="/2_samuel/16-4.htm">2 Samuel 16:4</a>, placing matters upon the old footing, by which Ziba was to have half the produce for cultivating the estate; the other, and apparently the most correct view, is that Ziba was now made actual owner of half the land, and Mephibosheth, instead of a half, would henceforth have only a quarter of the crops. The decision was not equitable, and David speaks in a curt and hurried manner, as though vexed with himself for what he was doing. As a matter of fact, Ziba's treachery had been most useful to David. Besides the pleasure at the time of finding one man faithful, when "all men were liars" (<a href="/psalms/116-11.htm">Psalm 116:11</a>), Ziba had been most active in bringing over the tribe of Benjamin to David's side; and though his motives were selfish and venal, yet, as the king reaped the benefit of his conduct, he was bound not to leave him without reward. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/19.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"For thy servant knoweth (i.e., I know) that I have sinned, and behold I have come to-day the first of the whole house of Joseph, to go to meet my lord the king." By "the whole house of Joseph" we are to understand the rest of the tribes with the exception of Judah, who are called "all Israel" in <a href="/2_samuel/19-12.htm">2 Samuel 19:12</a>. There is no reason for the objection taken by Thenius and Bttcher to the expression &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1470;&#1497;&#1493;&#1505;&#1507;.

The designation of the tribes that opposed Judah by the name of the leading tribe (Joseph: <a href="/joshua/16-1.htm">Joshua 16:1</a>) was as old as the jealousy between these tribes and Judah, which did not commence with the division of the kingdom, but was simply confirmed thereby into a permanent distinction. Shimei's prayer for the forgiveness of his sin was no more a proof of sincere repentance than the reason which he adduced in support of his petition, namely that he was the first of all the house of Joseph to come and meet David. Shimei's only desire was to secure impunity for himself. Abishai therefore replied (<a href="/2_samuel/19-21.htm">2 Samuel 19:21</a>), "Shall not Shimei be put to death for this (&#1494;&#1488;&#1514; &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;, for this, which he has just said and done), because he hath cursed the anointed of Jehovah?" (vid., <a href="/2_samuel/16-5.htm">2 Samuel 16:5</a>.). But David answered (<a href="/2_samuel/19-22.htm">2 Samuel 19:22</a>), "What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah (cf. <a href="/2_samuel/16-10.htm">2 Samuel 16:10</a>), for ye become opponents to me to-day?" &#1513;&#1474;&#1496;&#1503;, an opponent, who places obstacles in the way (<a href="/numbers/22-22.htm">Numbers 22:22</a>); here it signifies one who would draw away to evil. "Should any one be put to death in Israel to-day? for do I not know that I am this day king over Israel?" The reason assigned by David here for not punishing the blasphemer as he had deserved, by taking away his life, would have been a very laudable one if the king had really forgiven him. But as David when upon his deathbed charged his successor to punish Shimei for this cursing (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/2-8.htm">1 Kings 2:8-9</a>), the favour shown him here was only a sign of David's weakness, which was not worthy of imitation, the more especially as the king swore unto him (<a href="/2_samuel/19-24.htm">2 Samuel 19:24</a>) that he should not die. </body></html>
