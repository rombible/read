Mephibosheth &#8230; came down to meet the king&#8212;The reception given to Mephibosheth was less creditable to David. The sincerity of that prince's grief for the misfortunes of the king cannot be doubted.<p>He had neither dressed his feet&#8212;not taken the bath,<p>nor trimmed his beard&#8212;The Hebrews cut off the hair on the upper lip (see on [277]Le 13:45), and cheeks, but carefully cherished it on the chin from ear to ear. Besides dyeing it black or red colors, which, however, is the exception, and not the rule in the East, there are various modes of trimming it: they train it into a massy, bushy form, swelling and round; or they terminate it like a pyramid, in a sharp point. Whatever the mode, it is always trimmed with the greatest care; and they usually carry a small comb for the purpose. The neglect of this attention to his beard was an undoubted proof of the depth of Mephibosheth's grief. The king seems to have received him upbraidingly, and not to have been altogether sure either of his guilt or innocence. It is impossible to commend the cavalier treatment, any more than to approve the partial award, of David in this case. If he were too hurried and distracted by the pressure of circumstances to inquire fully into the matter, he should have postponed his decision; for if by "dividing the land" (2Sa 19:29) he meant that the former arrangement should be continued by which Mephibosheth was acknowledged the proprietor, and Ziba the farmer, it was a hardship inflicted on the owner to fix him with a tenant who had so grossly slandered him. But if by "dividing the land," they were now to share alike, the injustice of the decision was greatly increased. In any view, the generous, disinterested spirit displayed by Mephibosheth was worthy a son of the noble-hearted Jonathan.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/19.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> I am contented to lose all, being fully satisfied with the happiness of seeing my dear and dread sovereign restored to his crown, and truth and peace returned to his kingdom. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/19.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Mephibosheth said unto the king, yea, let him take all,....

(Solomn used a similar test to determine which woman's baby was alive. <a href="/1_kings/3-16.htm">1 Kings 3:16</a>. He purposed the baby be cut in two to reveal who the real mother was. Likewise, David suggests the property should be divided between Ziba and Miphibosheth to determine the true loyalty of the later. <a href="/2_samuel/19-29.htm">2 Samuel 19:29</a> Editor.) <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_samuel/19.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And Mephibosheth said unto the king, Yea, let him take all, forasmuch as my lord the king is come again in peace unto his own house.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/2_samuel/19.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">30</span>. <span class="ital">Yea, let him take all</span>] Mephibosheth’s affection was for his master, not for his property.
