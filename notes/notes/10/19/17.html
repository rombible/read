This might mean that, in bringing the king across, Shimei and the Benjamites led the way. But, first, the verb, which is a rare one, means that they dashed through the river impetuously; and secondly, <span class="accented">before the king</span>, means "in the king's presence." While the tribe of Judah remained on the left bank to receive the king on his landing, Shimei and Ziba sought favour by a show of excessive zeal, and forded the Jordan, so as to be the first to welcome him (see ver. 20). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/19.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When these words of all Israel were reported to David, he sent to the priests Zadok and Abiathar, saying, "Speak to the elders of Judah, why will ye be the last to bring back the king to his palace? ... Ye are my brethren, my bones and flesh (i.e., my blood relations): why then," etc.? The last clause of <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-11.htm">2 Samuel 19:11</a>, "the speech of all Israel is come to the king, even to his house," is a circumstantial clause inserted in the midst of David's words, to explain the appeal to the men of Judah not to be the last. In the lxx, and some Codices of the Vulgate, this sentence occurs twice, viz., at the end of <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-10.htm">2 Samuel 19:10</a>, and also of <a href="/2_samuel/19-11.htm">2 Samuel 19:11</a>; and Thenius, Ewald, and Bttcher regard the clause at the end of <a href="/2_samuel/19-10.htm">2 Samuel 19:10</a> as the original one, and the repetition of it at the close of <a href="/2_samuel/19-11.htm">2 Samuel 19:11</a> as a gloss. But this is certainly a mistake: for if the clause, "and the speech of all Israel came to the king to his house (at Mahanaim)," ought to stand at the close of <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-10.htm">2 Samuel 19:10</a>, and assigns the reason for David's sending to Zadok and Abiathar, <a href="/2_samuel/19-11.htm">2 Samuel 19:11</a> would certainly, or rather necessarily, commence with &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1498; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495;: "The word of all Israel came to the king, and then king David sent," etc. But instead of this, it commences with &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495; &#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491; &#1493;&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1498;, "But king David sent." This construction of the sentence decidedly favour the correctness of the Hebrew text; whereas the text of the Septuagint, apart altogether from the tautological repetition of the whole of the sentence in question, shows obviously enough that it is nothing more than a conjecture, by which the attempt was made to remove the difficulty occasioned by the striking position in which the circumstantial clause occurred. </body></html>
