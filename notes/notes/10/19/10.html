The Israelites Bring the King Back.<p>9-11. all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of Israel&#8212;The kingdom was completely disorganized. The sentiments of three different parties are represented in 2Sa 19:9, 10: the royalists, the adherents of Absalom who had been very numerous, and those who were indifferent to the Davidic dynasty. In these circumstances the king was right in not hastening back, as a conqueror, to reascend his throne. A re-election was, in some measure, necessary. He remained for some time on the other side of Jordan, in expectation of being invited back. That invitation was given without, however, the concurrence of Judah. David, disappointed and vexed by his own tribe's apparent lukewarmness, despatched the two high priests to rouse the Judahites to take a prominent interest in his cause. It was the act of a skilful politician. Hebron having been the seat of the rebellion, it was graceful on his part to encourage their return to allegiance and duty; it was an appeal to their honor not to be the last of the tribes. But this separate message, and the preference given to them, occasioned an outburst of jealousy among the other tribes that was nearly followed by fatal consequences [see 2Sa 19:40-43].<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/19.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Whom we anointed, </span> i.e. caused to be anointed by Zadok or Abiathar, or some other of the priests, whom they persuaded or constrained to do this office: for this being a sacred ceremony, of a great reputation, and a likely means to gain the more authority and veneration from the people to Absalom, as one whom God by his vicegerent had constituted and set up; and this rite being usual upon all translations of the government from one person to another in an extraordinary way, as this confessedly was; it is not likely that they would now omit it; though otherwise anointing is frequently put for designing or constituting. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Is dead in battle; </span> and therefore we have no obligation to him, and no hope of any thing from him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Why speak ye not a word?</span> the people of Israel speak thus to the elders of Israel, as appears by comparing this verse with the next.

With this anointment there must also have been a formal renunciation of David's rule, and, being thus dethroned, he does not attempt to return until the nation summons him back. As the flight of David narrated in ch. 16. was extremely hurried, the conspirators must have kept their counsel well, and whatever rumours reached him apparently he disregarded. But meanwhile representatives of the tribes secretly convened at Hebron had claimed to act in the name of Israel, and, chosen a new king. The words certainly imply that, had Absalom lived, the Israelites would have considered themselves bound to obey him. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/19.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>But the king had covered his face, and cried aloud, "My son Absalom," etc.</body></html>
