David stirred not till he received this invitation. Our Lord Jesus will rule in those that invite him to the throne in their hearts, and not till he is invited. He first bows the heart, and makes it willing in the day of his power, then rules in the midst of his enemies, Ps 110:2,3.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Of my bone ... - Render as in preceding verse, "art thou not my bone and my flesh?" It is curious to note how the phrase is used in <a href="/2_samuel/5-1.htm">2 Samuel 5:1</a> of common descent from Israel, in <a href="/2_samuel/19-12.htm">2 Samuel 19:12</a> of the closer kindred of the tribe of Judah, and in this verse of the yet nearer kindred between David and Amasa his sister's son.<p>Captain ... in the room of Joab - It is very plain that David felt the weight of Joab's overbearing influence to be very oppressive (compare <a href="/2_samuel/19-22.htm">2 Samuel 19:22</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/3-39.htm">2 Samuel 3:39</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/16-10.htm">2 Samuel 16:10</a>). He was, at this time, very angry with Joab for killing Absalom; and so, thinking it of vital importance to win over Amasa and the army of Judah, he did not scruple to offer him Joab's high post. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/19.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah&#8212;that is, Amasa, who had been won over, used his great influence in re-attaching the whole tribe of Judah to the interest of David.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/19.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">He; </span> either, first, Amasa, by his great influence upon them.

This the Jewish commentators generally understand of Amasa that he used his interest with the men of Judah, and so wrought upon them, that they agreed as one man to send for the king, and bring him back; but it seems best to understand it of David, who by these gentle methods, kind messages, and affectionate speeches, powerfully inclined and engaged the hearts of the people towards him; so that they were unanimously and affectionately agreed to restore him: in this way David chose to return; he could have come without their leave, or any invitation from them, as he was their lawful king, and a victorious one, the rebellion being crushed; and had it in his power to chastise those concerned in it, and use them with severity; but he chose rather to gain the hearts of his people, and to come in a way peaceable to them, and honourable to himself: <p>so that they sent this word unto the king, return thou and all thy servants; perhaps by the same messengers that David sent; or it may be, rather for honour's sake they deputed some of their principal men to wait on David, and invite him to return to them with all his retinue and army, promising allegiance and fidelity to him. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_samuel/19.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as the heart of one man; so that they sent this word unto the king, Return thou, and all thy servants.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/2_samuel/19.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">14</span>. <span class="ital">And he bowed</span>, &c.] By this message David inclined the hearts of the men of Judah to restore him to the throne.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he bowed,</span> etc. It was not Amasa, but David, who made all the members of his tribe unanimous in his recall. And not only were the high priests active in his cause, but David, He may feel sure, sent numerous messages to all the more powerful men, assuring them of forgiveness and favour. In his general policy he was right. After the solemn anointing of Absalom, it was necessary for him to wait until some equally public and national act authorized his resumption of the royal power; and delay was dangerous. Every day now spent at Mabanaim might give the opportunity for fresh troubles. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/19.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Nevertheless David was obliged to yield to his representations. "The king rose up, and sat in the gate, and ... all the people came before the king," i.e., the troops marched before the king, who (as we may supply from the context) manifested his good-will in both looks and words. But Israel, i.e., that portion of the people which had followed Absalom, had returned to its tents (i.e., gone home: cf. <a href="/2_samuel/18-17.htm">2 Samuel 18:17</a>). This sentence forms the transition to the account which follows. </body></html>
