David numbered the people that were with him&#8212;The hardy mountaineers of Gilead came in great numbers at the call of their chieftains, so that, although without money to pay any troops, David soon found himself at the head of a considerable army. A pitched battle was now inevitable. But so much depending on the life of the king, he was not allowed to take the field in person; and he therefore divided his forces into three detachments under Joab, Abishai, and Ittai, the commander of the foreign guards.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Under the hand of Joab, </span> to wit, for his especial conduct and management in the battle: otherwise Joab was the general of all the forces; nor had David yet taken away that power from him, nor was this a time to do it.

But the Israelites had no settled rule upon the point, and. when occasion required, Joab divided his army into two parts (<a href="/2_samuel/10-9.htm">2 Samuel 10:9, 10</a>). The reason of the threefold division in this case was that Ittai had brought his clan, or <span class="accented">taf</span>, with him, and as these would certainly not have fought under an Israelite leader, nor the Israelites under Ittai, David placed all foreigners under his command, while he gave his own nephews the command of the native troops. He thus avoided all jealousies; and Ittai's men, honoured by being made a distinct portion of the army, would feel their reputation at stake, and would rival the Israelites in valour. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/17.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Absalom had made Amasa captain over his army instead of Joab, who had remained true to David, and had gone with his king to Mahanaim. Amasa was the son of a man named Jithra, &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500;&#1497;, who had gone in to (i.e., had seduced) Abigail, the daughter of Nahash and sister of Zeruiah, Joab's mother. He was therefore an illegitimate cousin of Joab. The description given of Jithra as &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500;&#1497; is very striking, since there was no reason whatever why it should be stated that Amasa's father was an Israelite. The Seventy have therefore given &#x3bf;&#788; &#x399;&#787;&#x3b5;&#x3b6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;, i.e., sprung from Jezreel, where David's wife Ahinoam came from (<a href="/1_samuel/27-3.htm">1 Samuel 27:3</a>); but they have done so apparently from mere conjecture. The true reading is evidently &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1488;&#1500;&#1497;, an Ishmaelite, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-17.htm">1 Chronicles 2:17</a>, where the name is written Jether, a contracted form of Jithra. From the description given of Abigail as a daughter of Nahash and sister of Zeruiah, not of David, some of the earlier commentators have very justly concluded that Abigail and Zeruiah were only step-sisters of David, i.e., daughters of his mother by Nahash and not by Jesse. </body></html>
