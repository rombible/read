The more our hearts are fixed and enlarged, in thanksgiving to God for our mercies, the better disposed we shall be to bear with patience the afflictions mixed with them. Some think David's wish arose from concern about Absalom's everlasting state; but he rather seems to have spoken without due thought. He is to be blamed for showing so great fondness for a graceless son. Also for quarrelling with Divine justice. And for opposing the justice of the nation, which, as king, he had to administer, and which ought to be preferred before natural affection. The best men are not always in a good frame; we are apt to over-grieve for what we over-loved. But while we learn from this example to watch and pray against sinful indulgence, or neglect of our children, may we not, in David, perceive a shadow of the Saviour's love, who wept over, prayed for, and even suffered death for mankind, though vile rebels and enemies.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Ahimaaz was a well-known runner <a href="/2_samuel/18-27.htm">2 Samuel 18:27</a>.

He then took three staffs in his hand, and thrust them into Absalom's heart. &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1496;&#1497;&#1501; is rendered by the lxx and Vulgate, &#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;, lanceas; and Thenius would adopt &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495;&#1497;&#1501; accordingly, as an emendation of the text. But in the earlier Hebrew &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495; only occurs in poetical writings in the sense of a missile or dart (<a href="/job/33-18.htm">Job 33:18</a>; <a href="/job/36-12.htm">Job 36:12</a>; <a href="/joel/2-8.htm">Joel 2:8</a>); and it is not till after the captivity that we find it used to denote a weapon generally. There is no necessity, however, for altering the text. Joab caught up in his hurry the first thing that he found, namely pointed staff, and pierced Absalom with them to the heart. This explains the reason for his taking three, whereas one javelin or dart would have been sufficient, and also the fact that Absalom was not slain, notwithstanding their being thrust at his heart. The last clause of the verse belongs to what follows: "Still living (i.e., as he was still alive) in the midst of the terebinth, ten young men, Joab's armour-bearers, surrounded him, and smote him to death."  </body></html>
