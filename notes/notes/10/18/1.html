But so much depending on the life of the king, he was not allowed to take the field in person; and he therefore divided his forces into three detachments under Joab, Abishai, and Ittai, the commander of the foreign guards.David viewing the armies in their march, giveth them charge of Absalom, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/context/2_samuel/18-1.htm" title="And David numbered the people that were with him, and set captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds over them....">2 Samuel 18:1-5</a></span>; whose men are smitten: he hanging by his hair on an oak, is slain by Joab, and cast into a pit: his pillar and monument, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/context/2_samuel/18-6.htm" title="So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle was in the wood of Ephraim;...">2 Samuel 18:6-18</a></span>.

As Absalom gathered all Israel to him, there would be some delay; and David, like a wise general, made use of it for training the brave but undisciplined men who had joined him, chiefly from Gilead. Besides these, he had with him numerous veterans, whose skill and experience would be invaluable in such service. The result was that when the rebels came to close quarters, they had a vast body of men, but David a disciplined force, which, under skilful generalship, scattered Absalom's raw levies with ease. The arrangement into thousands and hundreds was in accordance with the civil divisions (<a href="/exodus/18-25.htm">Exodus 18:25</a>), both being, in fact, dictated by nature as multiples of our hands. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/17.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The account of the civil war, which terminated with Absalom's defeat and death, is introduced in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-24.htm">2 Samuel 17:24-26</a> with a description of the relative position of the two hostile parties.

Absalom had also gone over the Jordan, "he and all the men with him," i.e., all the fighting men that he had gathered together according to Hushai's advice, and encamped in the land of Gilead. </body></html>
