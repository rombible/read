But while they partly urge personal considerations, their chief argument is that David would be of more use if, posted with a body of troops at the city, he held himself in reserve to succour any division that might be in danger. And David, seeing how earnest their wish was, yielded to this representation, feeling that it would give steadiness to his men if they knew that so experienced a general was watching the fight, and was ready to succour them if they needed aid. As the people say that it would not matter "if half of us die," and that David "is worth ten thousand of us," Ewald draws the reasonable conclusion that their whole number was about twenty thousand men. The Hebrew literally is, "For now (<span class="accented">attah</span>) as us are ten thousand," which might mean, "There are ten thousand such as we are, but no one like thee." But the Septuagint and Vulgate read, "But thou (<span class="accented">attah</span>) art as ten thousand of us." The Syriac, however, like the Hebrew, reads "now." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/17.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Absalom had made Amasa captain over his army instead of Joab, who had remained true to David, and had gone with his king to Mahanaim. Amasa was the son of a man named Jithra, &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500;&#1497;, who had gone in to (i.e., had seduced) Abigail, the daughter of Nahash and sister of Zeruiah, Joab's mother. He was therefore an illegitimate cousin of Joab. The description given of Jithra as &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500;&#1497; is very striking, since there was no reason whatever why it should be stated that Amasa's father was an Israelite. The Seventy have therefore given &#x3bf;&#788; &#x399;&#787;&#x3b5;&#x3b6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;, i.e., sprung from Jezreel, where David's wife Ahinoam came from (<a href="/1_samuel/27-3.htm">1 Samuel 27:3</a>); but they have done so apparently from mere conjecture. The true reading is evidently &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1488;&#1500;&#1497;, an Ishmaelite, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-17.htm">1 Chronicles 2:17</a>, where the name is written Jether, a contracted form of Jithra. From the description given of Abigail as a daughter of Nahash and sister of Zeruiah, not of David, some of the earlier commentators have very justly concluded that Abigail and Zeruiah were only step-sisters of David, i.e., daughters of his mother by Nahash and not by Jesse. </body></html>
