But there is something astonishing in this excess of grief for such a reprobate; and I confess it is to me utterly unaccountable from any other principle than the sad and shocking reflection of his having died with all his sins upon his head, and gone down quick to perdition.” Certainly a deep sense of Absalom’s eternal state, as dying in his sins, together with the consideration, that David himself by his sins had been the occasion of his death, might be the principal cause of the excessive sorrow which he felt, and thus expressed. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/18.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>18:19-33 By directing David to give God thanks for his victory, Ahimaaz prepared him for the news of his son's death. The more our hearts are fixed and enlarged, in thanksgiving to God for our mercies, the better disposed we shall be to bear with patience the afflictions mixed with them. Some think David's wish arose from concern about Absalom's everlasting state; but he rather seems to have spoken without due thought. He is to be blamed for showing so great fondness for a graceless son. Also for quarrelling with Divine justice. And for opposing the justice of the nation, which, as king, he had to administer, and which ought to be preferred before natural affection. The best men are not always in a good frame; we are apt to over-grieve for what we over-loved. But while we learn from this example to watch and pray against sinful indulgence, or neglect of our children, may we not, in David, perceive a shadow of the Saviour's love, who wept over, prayed for, and even suffered death for mankind, though vile rebels and enemies.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Tidings ... - Rather, "Let my lord the king receive the good tidings." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24-32. David sat between the two gates&#8212;that is, in the tower-house on the wall that overhung the gate of Mahanaim. Near it was a watchtower, on which a sentinel was posted, as in times of war, to notify every occurrence. The delicacy of Ahimaaz' communication was made up by the unmistakable plainness of Cushi's. The death of Absalom was a heavy trial, and it is impossible not to sympathize with the outburst of feeling by which David showed that all thoughts of the victory he had won as a king were completely sunk in the painful loss he had sustained as a father. The extraordinary ardor and strength of his affection for this worthless son break out in the redundancy and vehemence of his mournful ejaculations.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> May they perish and be cut off, as he is. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/18.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the king said unto Cushi, is the young man Absalom safe?....
