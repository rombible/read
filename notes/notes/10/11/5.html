He had not, like Job, made a covenant with his eyes, or, at this time, he had forgotten it. And observe the steps of the sin. See how the way of sin is down-hill; when men begin to do evil, they cannot soon stop. Observe the aggravations of the sin.

With regard to the different account given in the corresponding text of the Chronicles as to the number of the slain, see the remarks on <a href="/2_samuel/10-6.htm">2 Samuel 10:6</a>. It is a fact worthy of notice, that the number of men who fell in the battle (seven hundred receb and forty thousand parashim, according to the text before us; seven thousand receb and forty thousand ragli, according to the Chronicles) agrees quite as well with the number of Aramaeans reported to be taken prisoners or slain, according to <a href="/2_samuel/8-4.htm">2 Samuel 8:4</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18-4.htm">1 Chronicles 18:4-5</a> (viz., seventeen hundred parashim or a thousand receb, and seven thousand parashim and twenty thousand ragli of Aram-Zoba, and twenty-two thousand of Aram-Damascus), as could possibly be expected considering the notorious corruption in the numbers as we possess them; so that there is scarcely any doubt that the number of Aramaeans who fell was the same in both accounts (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/8.htm">2 Samuel 8</a> and 10), and that in the chapter before us we have simply a more circumstantial account of the very same war of which the result is given in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/8.htm">2 Samuel 8</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/13-1.htm">1 Chronicles 13:1-14</a>. </body></html>
