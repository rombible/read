But Uriah slept at the door of the king's house&#8212;It is customary for servants to sleep in the porch or long gallery; and the guards of the Hebrew king did the same. Whatever his secret suspicions might have been, Uriah's refusal to indulge in the enjoyment of domestic pleasure, and his determination to sleep "at the door of the king's house," arose from a high and honorable sense of military duty and propriety (2Sa 11:11). But, doubtless, the resolution of Uriah was overruled by that Providence which brings good out of evil, and which has recorded this sad episode for the warning of the church.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">When they had told David; </span> whether of their own accord, or being first asked by David, it doth not appear. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Camest thou not from thy journey, </span> wearied with hard service and travel, and therefore didst need refreshment? nor did I expect or desire that thou shouldst now attend upon my person, or keep the watch. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And when they had told David,....

David expresses surprise and displeasure that Uriah had not done as men usually do on their return from a journey, and gone to his own home. Uriah’s brave resolution not to enjoy the comforts of his home even for a single night, while his comrades were enduring the hardships of a campaign, bade fair to frustrate David’s scheme for concealing his sin. He may too have had some suspicion of his wife’s unfaithfulness.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The information brought to him, that the beautiful woman was married, was not enough to stifle the sensual desires which arose in David's soul. "When lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin" (<a href="/james/1-15.htm">James 1:15</a>). David sent for the woman, and lay with her. In the expression "he took her, and she came to him," there is no intimation whatever that David brought Bathsheba into his palace through craft or violence, but rather that she came at his request without any hesitation, and offered no resistance to his desires. Consequently Bathsheba is not to be regarded as free from blame. The very act of bathing in the uncovered court of a house in the heart of the city, into which it was possible for any one to look down from the roofs of the houses on higher ground, does not say much for her feminine modesty, even if it was not done with an ulterior purpose, as some commentators suppose. Nevertheless in any case the greatest guilt rests upon David, that he, a man upon whom the Lord had bestowed such grace, did not resist the temptation to the lust of the flesh, but sent to fetch the woman. "When she had sanctified herself from her uncleanness, she returned to her house." Defilement from sexual intercourse rendered unclean till the evening (<a href="/leviticus/15-18.htm">Leviticus 15:18</a>). Bathsheba thought it her duty to observe this statute most scrupulously, though she did not shrink from committing the sin of adultery.</body></html>
