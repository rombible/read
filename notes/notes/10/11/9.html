But Uriah slept at the door of the king's house&#8212;It is customary for servants to sleep in the porch or long gallery; and the guards of the Hebrew king did the same. Whatever his secret suspicions might have been, Uriah's refusal to indulge in the enjoyment of domestic pleasure, and his determination to sleep "at the door of the king's house," arose from a high and honorable sense of military duty and propriety (2Sa 11:11). But, doubtless, the resolution of Uriah was overruled by that Providence which brings good out of evil, and which has recorded this sad episode for the warning of the church.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">With all the servants of his lord; </span> with the king’s guard.

Eliam and Ammiel have the same signification; the difference simply consists in the transposition of the component parts of the name. It is impossible to determine, however, which of the two forms was the original one.</body></html>
