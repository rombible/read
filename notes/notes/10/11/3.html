He had not, like Job, made a covenant with his eyes, or, at this time, he had forgotten it. And observe the steps of the sin.

And the conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom.">2 Samuel 15:12</a>) as an act of revenge for the seduction of his grand-daughter and the murder of her husband. The theory has been well worked out with much ingenuity by Prof. Blunt (<span class="ital">Undesigned Coincidences</span>, p. 135 ff.), but must be regarded as very doubtful: for (1) the identity of Eliam the son of Ahithophel with Eliam the father of Bath-sheba cannot be proved; (2) even if the relationship is granted, an ambitious and unscrupulous man such as Ahithophel would be more likely to regard the elevation of his granddaughter to the position of the king’s favourite wife as an honour, than to feel aggrieved at the circumstances by which it was effected.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Uriah the Hittite</span>] One of David’s “mighty men” (ch. <a href="/2_samuel/23-39.htm" title="Uriah the Hittite: thirty and seven in all.">2 Samuel 23:39</a>).

Mr. Blunt, in his 'Undesigned Coincidences,' p. 143, <span class="accented">et seq.</span>, sees in this the explanation of the adherence to the side of Absalom of a man so high in King David's service. It was the result of his indignation at David's profligate treat-meat of so near a relative. In <a href="/1_chronicles/3-5.htm">1 Chronicles 3:5</a> she is called "Bathshua, the daughter of Ammiel."

It is very evident, not only from the words "he sent and brought out Aram, which was beyond the river," but also from the fact that Shobach, Hadarezer's general (Shophach according to the Chronicles), was at the head of the Mesopotamian troops, that the Mesopotamian troops who were summoned to help were under the supreme ruler of Hadarezer. This is placed beyond all possible doubt by <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-19.htm">2 Samuel 10:19</a>, where the kings who had fought with Hadarezer against the Israelites are called his "servants," or vassals. &#1495;&#1497;&#1500;&#1501; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1489;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; (<a href="/2_samuel/10-16.htm">2 Samuel 10:16</a>) might be translated "and their army came;" but when we compare with this the &#1495;&#1500;&#1488;&#1502;&#1492; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1489;&#1488; of <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-17.htm">2 Samuel 10:17</a>, we are compelled to render it as a proper name (as in the Septuagint, Chaldee, Syriac, and Arabic) - "and they (the men from beyond the Euphrates) came (marched) to Helam" - and to take &#1495;&#1497;&#1500;&#1501; as a contracted form of &#1495;&#1500;&#1488;&#1501;. The situation of this place has not yet been discovered. Ewald supposes it to be connected with the Syrian town Alamatha upon the Euphrates (Ptol. Geogr. v. 15); but this is not to be thought of for a moment, if only because it cannot be supposed that the Aramaeans would fall back to the Euphrates, and wait for the Israelites to follow them thither before they gave them battle; and also on account of <a href="/2_samuel/8-4.htm">2 Samuel 8:4</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18-3.htm">1 Chronicles 18:3</a>, from which it is evident that Helam is to be sought for somewhere in the neighbourhood of Hamath.
