This palace was on the height of Mount Zion, and looked down upon the open courts of the houses in the lower city. In one of these he saw a beautiful woman bathing. In the courts of the houses it was common to have a basin of water, and the place was probably entirely concealed from every other point of observation than the roof of the palace, from which no harm was suspected.<p>David’s grievous fall was consequent upon his long course of uninterrupted prosperity and power, which had somewhat intoxicated him and thrown him off his guard. It is no part of the plan of Scripture to cover up or excuse the sins of even its greatest heroes and saints. This sin was followed by the deepest repentance and by the Divine forgiveness; nevertheless its punishment overclouded all the remaining years of David’s life. His fall, as St. Augustine has said, should put upon their guard those who have not fallen, and save from despair those who have.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/2_samuel/11.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/2_samuel/11-2.htm" title="And it came to pass in an evening, that David arose from off his bed, and walked on the roof of the king's house: and from the roof he saw a woman washing herself; and the woman was very beautiful to look on.">2 Samuel 11:2</a></span>. <span class="ital">David arose from off his bed — </span>Where he had lain down to sleep in the heat of the day, as the manner was in those countries; and where he had probably slept for some time.

He had not, like Job, made a covenant with his eyes, or, at this time, he had forgotten it. And observe the steps of the sin. See how the way of sin is down-hill; when men begin to do evil, they cannot soon stop. Observe the aggravations of the sin.

David’s adultery with Bath-sheba<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is one object of Holy Scripture to paint sin in its true colours. No friendly flattery, no false modesty, draws a veil over this dark scene in David’s life. It is recorded as a warning (<a href="/context/1_corinthians/10-11.htm" title="Now all these things happened to them for ensamples: and they are written for our admonition, on whom the ends of the world are come....">1 Corinthians 10:11-12</a>), that even holy men may yield to temptation and fall into gross sin; that one sin almost inevitably leads to others; that sin, even when repented of, brings punishment in its train.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>With stern simplicity the inspired prophet-historian describes how “the lust, when it hath conceived, beareth sin: and the sin, when it is full grown, bringeth forth death” (<a href="/james/1-15.htm" title="Then when lust has conceived, it brings forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, brings forth death.">James 1:15</a>). The king who but a few years before had sung of “clean hands and a pure heart” (<a href="/psalms/24-4.htm" title="He that has clean hands, and a pure heart; who has not lifted up his soul to vanity, nor sworn deceitfully.">Psalm 24:4</a>), and vowed to exclude from his palace all workers of deceit (<a href="/psalms/101-7.htm" title="He that works deceit shall not dwell within my house: he that tells lies shall not tarry in my sight.">Psalm 101:7</a>) is dragged by his passion into meanness, ingratitude, dissimulation, treachery, murder. “These things were written for our admonition … Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall” (<a href="/context/1_corinthians/10-11.htm" title="Now all these things happened to them for ensamples: and they are written for our admonition, on whom the ends of the world are come....">1 Corinthians 10:11-12</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But if the history is a stern record of the enthralling power and the inevitable consequences of sin, it is no less a testimony to the liberating power of repentance. “Sicut lapsus David cautos facit eos qui non ceciderunt, sic desperatos esse non vult qui ceciderunt” (Augustine on Psalms 51): or in the words of Bishop Hall: “How can we presume of not sinning, or despair for sinning, when we find so great a saint thus fallen, thus risen.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is the necessary key to the history of the rest of David’s reign. It explains the sudden overclouding of his life; the change from triumph and prosperity to sorrow and failure. See further in the Introduction, ch.

In so doing he was probably following his usual habits; but temptation came upon him, as so often is the case, unexpectedly. We are told that it is regarded in the East as improper for one neighbour to look over the battlement of his house into the inner court of the next dwelling (Philippson). Considering the jealousy with which Orientals guard the female members of their family from intrusion, it was a wrong act on the king's part to spy into what was going on in the recesses of the adjoining house. But he did so, and suffered for it years of disgrace and misery. For he saw a beautiful woman, the wife of one of his high officers, bathing, probably to purify herself from some legal uncleanness, such as those mentioned in <a href="/leviticus/15.htm">Leviticus 15</a>. No blame, so far, must be attached to her. The place was regarded as perfectly secluded, and probably neither she nor Uriah had ever suspected that what went on there could be observed from the roof of the king's palace. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Aramaeans, however, gathered together again after the first defeat, to continue the war; and Hadarezer, the most powerful of the Aramaean kings, sent messengers to Mesopotamia, and summoned it to war. It is very evident, not only from the words "he sent and brought out Aram, which was beyond the river," but also from the fact that Shobach, Hadarezer's general (Shophach according to the Chronicles), was at the head of the Mesopotamian troops, that the Mesopotamian troops who were summoned to help were under the supreme ruler of Hadarezer. This is placed beyond all possible doubt by <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-19.htm">2 Samuel 10:19</a>, where the kings who had fought with Hadarezer against the Israelites are called his "servants," or vassals. &#1495;&#1497;&#1500;&#1501; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1489;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; (<a href="/2_samuel/10-16.htm">2 Samuel 10:16</a>) might be translated "and their army came;" but when we compare with this the &#1495;&#1500;&#1488;&#1502;&#1492; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1489;&#1488; of <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-17.htm">2 Samuel 10:17</a>, we are compelled to render it as a proper name (as in the Septuagint, Chaldee, Syriac, and Arabic) - "and they (the men from beyond the Euphrates) came (marched) to Helam" - and to take &#1495;&#1497;&#1500;&#1501; as a contracted form of &#1495;&#1500;&#1488;&#1501;. The situation of this place has not yet been discovered. Ewald supposes it to be connected with the Syrian town Alamatha upon the Euphrates (Ptol. Geogr. v. 15); but this is not to be thought of for a moment, if only because it cannot be supposed that the Aramaeans would fall back to the Euphrates, and wait for the Israelites to follow them thither before they gave them battle; and also on account of <a href="/2_samuel/8-4.htm">2 Samuel 8:4</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18-3.htm">1 Chronicles 18:3</a>, from which it is evident that Helam is to be sought for somewhere in the neighbourhood of Hamath.
