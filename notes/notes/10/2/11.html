The nation in general refused David. By this the Lord trained up his servant for future honour and usefulness; and the tendency of true godliness was shown in his behaviour while passing through various difficulties. David was herein a type of Christ, whom Israel would not submit to, though anointed of the Father to be a Prince and a Saviour to them. Abner meant, Let the young men fight before us, when he said, Let them play before us: fools thus make a mock at sin. But he is unworthy the name of a man, that can thus trifle with human blood.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Forty ... two - The numerals are somewhat strange. First, as regards the 40 years. Even assuming that Ish-bosheth's reign did not commence until five and a half years after Saul's death, which must have been the case if the two years in the text gives the true length of his reign, it is startling to hear of Saul's younger son being 35 years old at his father's death, born consequently some three years before his father's accession, and five years older than David, the bosom friend of his older brother Jonathan. The age, too, of Jonathan's child, Mephibosheth, who was five years old at his father's death, would lead one to expect rather a less age for his uncle. Next, as regards the two years. Since David (compare <a href="/2_samuel/2-11.htm">2 Samuel 2:11</a>; and marginal references) reigned seven years in Hebron over Judah only, it follows, if the two years in the text are correct, either that an interval of five years elapsed between Ish-bosheth's death and David's being anointed "king over all Israel," or that a like interval elapsed between Saul's death and the commencement of Ish-bosheth's reign. Of the two the latter is the more probable, and has the advantage of diminishing Ish-bosheth's age by between five and six years. But the narrative in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/3.htm">2 Samuel 3</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/4-1.htm">2 Samuel 4:1-12</a> of the "long war," of the birth of David's six sons, and of Abner's conspiracy and death, seems to imply a longer time than two years, in which case both the numerals would have to be corrected. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9, 10. over Gilead&#8212;used in a loose sense for the land beyond Jordan.<p>Ashurites&#8212;the tribe of Asher in the extreme north.<p>Jezreel&#8212;the extensive valley bordering on the central tribes.<p>over all Israel &#8230; But Judah&#8212;David neither could nor would force matters.

"After this," i.e., after the facts related in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/1.htm">2 Samuel 1</a>, David inquired of the Lord, namely through the Urim, whether he should go up to one of the towns of Judah, and if so, to which. He received the reply, "to Hebron," a place peculiarly well adapted for a capital, not only from its situation upon the mountains, and in the centre of the tribe, but also from the sacred reminiscences connected with it from the olden time. David could have no doubt that, now that Saul was dead, he would have to give up his existing connection with the Philistines and return to his own land. But as the Philistines had taken the greater part of the Israelitish territory through their victory at Gilboa, and there was good reason to fear that the adherents of Saul, more especially the army with Abner, Saul's cousin, at its head, would refuse to acknowledge David as king, and consequently a civil war might break out, David would not return to his own land without the express permission of the Lord. <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-2.htm">2 Samuel 1:2-4</a>. When he went with his wives and all his retinue (vid., <a href="/1_samuel/27-2.htm">1 Samuel 27:2</a>) to Hebron and the "cities of Hebron," i.e., the places belonging to the territory of Hebron, the men of Judah came (in the persons of their elders) and anointed him king over the house, i.e., the tribe, of Judah. Just as Saul was made king by the tribes after his anointing by Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/11-15.htm">1 Samuel 11:15</a>), so David was first of all anointed by Judah here, and afterwards by the rest of the tribes (<a href="/2_samuel/5-3.htm">2 Samuel 5:3</a>).<p>A new section commences with &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;. The first act of David as king was to send messengers to Jabesh, to thank the inhabitants of this city for burying Saul, and to announce to them his own anointing as king. As this expression of thanks involved a solemn recognition of the departed king, by which David divested himself of even the appearance of a rebellion, the announcement of the anointing he had received contained an indirect summons to the Jabeshites to recognise him as their king now. </body></html>
