It was five and a half miles north-west from Jerusalem, and at a long distance both from Mahanaim and from Hebron.

David was herein a type of Christ, whom Israel would not submit to, though anointed of the Father to be a Prince and a Saviour to them.

After establishing Ish-bosheth’s power over all Israel, Abner turned his arms against Judah, and marched with his army from Ish-bosheth’s capital, Mahanaim, to Gibeon, where David’s army under the command of Joab met him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">to Gibeon</span>] The site of Gibeon (=<span class="ital">belonging to</span>, or <span class="ital">built on, a hill</span>) is fixed with certainty on a rounded hill five miles N.W. of Jerusalem, which still bears the name <span class="ital">El-Jib</span>. Gibeon was the largest of the four cities of the Hivites (<a href="/joshua/10-2.htm" title="That they feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city, as one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all the men thereof were mighty.">Joshua 10:2</a>), famous for the stratagem by which its inhabitants procured a treaty from Joshua (<a href="/joshua/9-3.htm" title="And when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and to Ai,">Joshua 9:3</a> ff.). It was in the territory of Benjamin (<a href="/joshua/18-25.htm" title="Gibeon, and Ramah, and Beeroth,">Joshua 18:25</a>), and specially assigned to the priests (<a href="/joshua/21-17.htm" title="And out of the tribe of Benjamin, Gibeon with her suburbs, Geba with her suburbs,">Joshua 21:17</a>).

It gained its chief importance in the reigns of David and Solomon, as the great centre of worship at which the Tabernacle and the Altar of Burnt-offering were set up before the building of the Temple (<a href="/2_chronicles/1-3.htm" title="So Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon; for there was the tabernacle of the congregation of God, which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in the wilderness.">2 Chronicles 1:3</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/1-5.htm" title="Moreover the brazen altar, that Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made, he put before the tabernacle of the LORD: and Solomon and the congregation sought to it.">2 Chronicles 1:5</a>), at which Solomon celebrated his accession with solemn sacrifices, and God appeared to him in vision (<a href="/context/1_kings/3-4.htm" title="And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the great high place: a thousand burnt offerings did Solomon offer on that altar....">1 Kings 3:4-15</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Abner...  went out.</span> This is a further proof of considerable success on Abner's side. Encouraged by the result of numerous skirmishes with the Philistines, and the gradual restoration of the king's authority in Ephraim and Benjamin, Abner determined to make the attempt to win back Judah also. There David had been content with protecting Judah, and establishing good order; and, following his constant custom, had taken no steps to obtain for himself the kingdom "over all Israel." The war was of Abner's choosing, and shows him to us in the character of an able but ambitious and restless man. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"And now," sc., that ye have shown this love to Saul your lord, "may Jehovah show you grace and truth." "Grace and truth" are connected together, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6</a>, as the two sides by which the goodness of God is manifested to men, namely in His forgiving grace, and in His trustworthiness, or the fulfilment of His promises (vid., <a href="/psalms/25-10.htm">Psalm 25:10</a>). "And I also show you this good," namely the prayer for the blessing of God (<a href="/2_samuel/2-5.htm">2 Samuel 2:5</a>), because ye have done this (to Saul). In <a href="/2_samuel/2-7.htm">2 Samuel 2:7</a> there is attached to this the demand, that now that Saul their lord was dead, and the Judaeans had anointed him (David) king, they would show themselves valiant, namely valiant in their reverence and fidelity towards David, who had become their king since the death of Saul. &#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501; &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1494;&#1511;&#1504;&#1492;, i.e., be comforted, spirited (cf. <a href="/judges/7-11.htm">Judges 7:11</a>). It needed some resolution and courage to recognise David as king, because Saul's army had fled to Gilead, and there was good ground for apprehending opposition to David on the part of Abner. Ishbosheth, however, does not appear to have been proclaimed king yet; or at any rate the fact was not yet known to David. &#1493;&#1490;&#1501; does not belong to &#1488;&#1514;&#1497;, but to the whole clause, as &#1488;&#1514;&#1497; is placed first merely for the sake of emphasis. </body></html>
