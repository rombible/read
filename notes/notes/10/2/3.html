David, by God's Direction, Goes Up to Hebron, and Is Made King over Judah.<p>1-4. David inquired of the Lord&#8212;By Urim (1Sa 23:6, 9; 30:7, 8). He knew his destination, but he knew also that the providence of God would pave the way. Therefore he would take no step in such a crisis of his own and the nation's history, without asking and obtaining the divine direction. He was told to go into Judah, and fix his headquarters in Hebron, whither he accordingly repaired with his now considerable force. There his interests were very powerful; for he was not only within his own tribe, and near chiefs with whom he had been long in friendly relations (see on [257]1Sa 30:26), but Hebron was the capital and center of Judah, and one of the Levitical cities; the inhabitants of which were strongly attached to him, both from sympathy with his cause ever since the massacre at Nob, and from the prospect of realizing in his person their promised pre-eminence among the tribes. The princes of Judah, therefore, offered him the crown over their tribe, and it was accepted. More could not, with prudence, be done in the circumstances of the country (1Ch 11:3).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> i.e. The cities or towns belonging and subject to Hebron, which was the metropolis, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/joshua/21-11.htm" title="And they gave them the city of Arba the father of Anak, which city is Hebron, in the hill country of Judah, with the suburbs thereof round about it.">Joshua 21:11</a>,12</span>; for in Hebron itself there was not space for them all, because it was filled with priests, and with David’s court. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And his men that were with him did David bring up, every man with his household,....

Moreover they had flocks and herds captured from the Amalekites, for which they needed pasturage. And therefore David dispersed them in the towns and villages of which Hebron was the capital, posting them in such a manner as to render it easy for him to summon them together, while taking care that they did not injure his tribesmen, or dispossess them of their lauds. We may feel sure that he consulted the chief men of Hebron as to these arrangements, and obtained their approval. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In death as in life, the two heroes were not divided, for they were alike in bravery and courage. Notwithstanding their difference of character, and the very opposite attitude which they assumed towards David, the noble Jonathan did not forsake his father, although his fierce hatred towards the friend whom Jonathan loved as his own soul might have undermined his attachment to his father. The two predicates, &#1504;&#1488;&#1492;&#1489;, loved and amiable, and &#1504;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501;, affectionate or kind, apply chiefly to Jonathan; but they were also suitable to Saul in the earliest years of his reign, when he manifested the virtues of an able ruler, which secured for him the lasting affection and attachment of the people. In his mourning over the death of the fallen hero, David forgets all the injury that Saul has inflicted upon him, so that he only brings out and celebrates the more amiable aspects of his character. The light motion or swiftness of an eagle (cf. <a href="/habakkuk/1-8.htm">Habakkuk 1:8</a>), and the strength of a lion (vid., <a href="/2_samuel/17-10.htm">2 Samuel 17:10</a>), were the leading characteristics of the great heroes of antiquity. - Lastly, in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-24.htm">2 Samuel 1:24</a>, David commemorates the rich booty which Saul had brought to the nation, for the purpose of celebrating his heroic greatness in this respect as well. &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497; was the scarlet purple (see at <a href="/exodus/25-4.htm">Exodus 25:4</a>).
