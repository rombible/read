The literal rendering is, <span class= "ital">I also show you this good, </span>the Hebrew not conveying directly the idea of future recompense, as in the English. The thought is that David, as now the rightful king of Israel, appreciates the act, and wishes to show publicly his favour to the men of Jabesh-gilead. He then, in the following verse, suggests the propriety of their now recognising him as the successor of their lost monarch and friend.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:1-7.

His first anointing indicated God's secret purpose, his second the accomplishment of that purpose. (Compare the case of Saul, <a href="/1_samuel/10-1.htm">1 Samuel 10:1</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/11-14.htm">1 Samuel 11:14</a>.) David was anointed again king over Israel <a href="/2_samuel/5-3.htm">2 Samuel 5:3</a>. The interval between the anointing of the Lord Jesus as the Christ of God, and His taking to Himself His kingdom and glory, seems to be thus typified. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5-7. David sent messengers unto the men of Jabesh-gilead&#8212;There can be no doubt that this message of thanks for their bold and dangerous enterprise in rescuing the bodies of Saul and his sons was an expression of David's personal and genuine feeling of satisfaction. At the same time, it was a stroke of sound and timely policy. In this view the announcement of his royal power in Judah, accompanied by the pledge of his protection of the men of Jabesh-gilead, should they be exposed to danger for their adventure at Beth-shan, would bear an important significance in all parts of the country and hold out an assurance that he would render them the same timely and energetic succor that Saul had done at the beginning of his reign.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Kindness and truth, </span> i. e. true and real kindness; not in words only, but also in actions, as you have now done to your king, the Lord’s anointed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I also will require you this kindness; </span> so far am I from being offended with you for this kindness to my late enemy, that I will requite it. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And now the Lord show kindness and truth unto you,....

He not only prayed to God to bless them and reward them for it, but would remember them himself, and at a proper opportunity would show favour to them for this act of kindness to Saul. De Dieu proposes to consideration whether it may not be as well interpreted to this sense, "and I also do you this kindness" because of it; that is, have done you this honour by sending messengers to you, to thank you for it, and by wishing a blessing upon you on account of it, and by praising and commending you for it; but the former sense seems best. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_samuel/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And now the LORD shew kindness and <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> truth unto you: and I also will requite you this kindness, because ye have done this thing.</span><p>(d) According to his promise, which is to repay those who are merciful.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/2_samuel/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>. <span class="ital">the</span> Lord <span class="ital">shew kindness and truth unto you</span>] Kindness and truth, i.e. <span class="ital">mercy</span> and <span class="ital">faithfulness</span>, are attributes of God’s character often coupled together.
