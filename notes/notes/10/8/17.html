Zadok, of the elder line of Eleazar (<a href="/1_chronicles/6-4.htm">1 Chronicles 6:4-8, 50-53</a>), was high priest at Gibeon, and Ahimelech, of the junior line of Ithamar, was the high priest at Jerusalem. Instead of <span class="accented">Ahimelech the son of Abiathar</span>, the Syriac transposes the names, and reads, "Abiathar the son of Ahimelech" This agrees with the list in <a href="/2_samuel/20-25.htm">2 Samuel 20:25</a>, and it is certain that Abiathar outlived David (<a href="/1_kings/2-26.htm">1 Kings 2:26</a>), and that he was David's high priest throughout his reign, though Zadok is not only constantly associated with him, but is placed first, as the man of higher rank (<a href="/2_samuel/15-24.htm">2 Samuel 15:24-35</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/17-15.htm">2 Samuel 17:15</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/19-11.htm">2 Samuel 19:11</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/20-25.htm">2 Samuel 20:25</a>). It is also remarkable that our Lord makes Abiathar the person who gave David the shewbread (<a href="/mark/2-26.htm">Mark 2:26</a>), whereas in <a href="/1_samuel/21.htm">1 Samuel 21</a>. he is repeatedly called Ahimelech. As both the LXX. and the Vulgate support the Hebrew against the Syriac, and as the reading "Ahimelech" is confirmed by <a href="/1_chronicles/18-16.htm">1 Chronicles 18:16</a> and 1 Chron 24:3, 6, 31, we must reject the emendation of the Syriac, and conclude that there was a double tradition respecting these names, some manuscripts making Abiathar the father, and others giving the seniority to Ahimelech. Our Lord made Abiathar the father, but the scribes, in their editing of the Hebrew text, gave that place to Ahimelech, yet did not carry out their restoration so thoroughly as not to  leave proof that the names probably ought to be reversed. <span class="cmt_word">Seraiah was scribe.</span> His office was similar to that of a secretary of state with us. For <span class="accented">Seraiah</span> we have <span class="accented">Shavsha</span> in <a href="/1_chronicles/18-16.htm">1 Chronicles 18:16</a>, <span class="accented">Shisha</span> in <a href="/1_kings/4-3.htm">1 Kings 4:3</a>, and <span class="accented">Sheva</span> in <a href="/2_samuel/20-25.htm">2 Samuel 20:25</a>. This illustrates what has just been said as to the uncertainty about proper names. They are always most difficult to read, as the sense gives no aid, and these various forms of a name that does not occur elsewhere really bear witness to the high antiquity of the manuscripts uses by the scribes in settling the text of the Old Testament; and also to their self-restraint in not making them all forcibly agree. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>David also sanctified Toi's presents to the Lord (handed them over to the treasury of the sanctuary), together with the silver and gold which he had sanctified from all the conquered nations, from Aram, Moab, etc. Instead of &#1492;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; the text of the Chronicles has &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, which he took, i.e., took as booty. Both are equally correct; there is simply a somewhat different turn given to the thought.<p>(Note: Bertheau erroneously maintains that &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, which he took, is at variance with <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-7.htm">2 Samuel 8:7</a>, as, according to this passage, the golden shields of Hadadezer did not become the property of the Lord. But there is not a word to that effect in <a href="/2_samuel/8-7.htm">2 Samuel 8:7</a>. On the contrary, his taking the shields to Jerusalem implies, rather than precludes, the intention to devote them to the purposes of the sanctuary.)<p>In the enumeration of the conquered nations in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-12.htm">2 Samuel 8:12</a>, the text of the Chronicles differs from that of the book before us. In the first place, we find "from Edom" instead of "from Aram;" and secondly, the clause "and of the spoil of Hadadezer, son of Rehob king of Zobah," is altogether wanting there. The text of the Chronicles is certainly faulty here, as the name of Aram (Syria) could not possibly be omitted. Edom could much better be left out, not "because the conquest of Edom belonged to a later period," as Movers maintains, but because the conquest of Edom is mentioned for the first time in the subsequent verses. But if we bear in mind that in <a href="/2_samuel/8-12.htm">2 Samuel 8:12</a> of both texts not only are those tribes enumerated the conquest of which had been already noticed, but all the tribes that David ever defeated and subjugated, even the Ammonites and Amalekites, to the war with whom no allusion whatever is made in the present chapter, we shall see that Edom could not be omitted. Consequently "from Syria" must have dropped out of the text of the Chronicles, and "from Edom" out of the one before us; so that the text in both instances ran originally thus, "from Syria, and from Edom, and from Moab." For even in the text before us, "from Aram" (Syria) could not well be omitted, notwithstanding the fact that the booty of Hadadezer is specially mentioned at the close of the verse, for the simple reason that David not only made war upon Syria-Zobah (the kingdom of Hadadezer) and subdued it, but also upon Syria-Damascus, which was quite independent of Zobah. </body></html>
