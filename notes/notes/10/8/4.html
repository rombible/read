He smote the Moabites, and made them tributaries to Israel. Two parts he destroyed, the third part he spared. The line that was to keep alive, though it was but one, is ordered to be a full line.

He Smites Hadadezer and the Syrians.<p>3. Zobah&#8212;(1Ch 18:3). This kingdom was bounded on the east by the Euphrates, and it extended westward from that river, perhaps as far north as Aleppo. It was long the chief among the petty kingdoms of Syria, and its king bore the hereditary title of "Hadadezer" or "Hadarezer" ("Hadad," that is, "helped").<p>as he went to recover his border at the river Euphrates&#8212;in accordance with the promises God made to Israel that He would give them all the country as far as the Euphrates (Ge 15:18; Nu 24:17). In the first campaign David signally defeated Hadadezer. Besides a great number of foot prisoners, he took from him an immense amount of booty in chariots and horses. Reserving only a small number of the latter, he hamstrung the rest. The horses were thus mutilated because they were forbidden to the Hebrews, both in war and agriculture. So it was of no use to keep them. Besides, their neighbors placed much dependence on cavalry, but having, for want of a native breed, to procure them by purchase, the greatest damage that could be done to such enemies was to render their horses unserviceable in war. (See also Ge 46:6; Jos 11:6, 9). A king of Damascene-Syria came to Hadadezer's succor; but David routed those auxiliary forces also, took possession of their country, put garrisons into their fortified towns, and made them tributary.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Chariots; </span> which word is fitly supplied out of <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/1_chronicles/18-4.htm" title="And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: David also hamstrung all the chariot horses, but reserved of them an hundred chariots.">1 Chronicles 18:4</a></span>, such substantives being oft understood in the Hebrew language, as <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/genesis/26-30.htm" title="And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink.">Genesis 26:30</a> <a href="/2_samuel/21-16.htm" title="And Ishbibenob, which was of the sons of the giant, the weight of whose spear weighed three hundred shekels of brass in weight, he being girded with a new sword, thought to have slain David.">2 Samuel 21:16</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Seven hundred horsemen, </span> or <span class="ital">seven hundred companies</span> of horsemen, i. e. in all <span class="ital">seven thousand</span>; as it is <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/1_chronicles/18-4.htm" title="And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: David also hamstrung all the chariot horses, but reserved of them an hundred chariots.">1 Chronicles 18:4</a></span>; there being ten on each company, and each ten having a ruler or captain, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/exodus/18-21.htm" title="Moreover you shall provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens:">Exodus 18:21</a> <a href="/deuteronomy/1-15.htm" title="So I took the chief of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you, captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, and captains over fifties, and captains over tens, and officers among your tribes.">Deu 1:15</a></span>.

The numbers of the Chronicler are more in proportion to one another than those mentioned here, provided we assume that the word "chariots" ought to be supplied, which, as it is not the only difference, is uncertain. Until the Arabs invented our present system of notation, the ancient methods of representing numbers were so liable to error that little dependence can be placed upon them. The Hebrews used their letters for numerals, but after 400 their system breaks down. Any number higher than 400 can be represented only by long sums in arithmetic, or by an intricate system of points above and below, which were sure to get into confusion. <span class="cmt_word">David houghed all the chariot</span> <span class="cmt_word">horses</span>. There is good reason for concluding that the word used here, <span class="accented">recheb</span>, is a collective, and signifies animals used either for riding or driving. What David reserved was not a hundred chariots, but a hundred riding horses, which would be useful to him for rapid communication, and could scarcely be regarded as a violation of the command in <a href="/deuteronomy/17-16.htm">Deuteronomy 17:16</a>. Both the Authorized and Revised Versions are wrong, but the Authorized Version at least makes the word <span class="accented">recheb</span> have the same meaning in both clauses, whereas the Revised Version makes it signify chariot horses in the first clause, and the chariots themselves in the second. The defeat by David, with infantry only, of an army provided with so powerful a force of cavalry and chariots, proves his great military skill, and their capture hears even more emphatic testimony to his generalship. In the Psalms we find horses often referred to as objects regarded with terror, and which gave a great advantage to their enemies (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>; <a href="/psalms/33-17.htm">Psalm 33:17</a>; <a href="/psalms/76-6.htm">Psalm 76:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/147-10.htm">Psalm 147:10</a>), but over which they had triumphed by Jehovah's aid. This method, however, of rendering them useless, though practised by Joshua (<a href="/joshua/11-6.htm">Joshua 11:6</a>), was most cruel; as the poor things, unable to move about with the sinews of their hind legs severed, would perish of hunger. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>David felt himself encouraged to offer this prayer through the revelation which he had received.
