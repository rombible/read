Thus, in the conquest of a soul by the grace of the Son of David, what stands in opposition to God must be destroyed, every lust must be mortified and crucified, but what may glorify him must be dedicated; thus the property of it is altered. God employs his servants in various ways; some, as David, in spiritual battles; others, as Solomon, in spiritual buildings; and one prepares work for the other, that God may have the glory of all.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Syrians - Read the Edomites, as in marginal references (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/60-1.htm">Psalm 60:1-12</a> title), and as the context <a href="/2_samuel/8-14.htm">2 Samuel 8:14</a> requires.

David gat him a name when he returned from smiting of the Syrians&#8212;Instead of Syrians, the Septuagint version reads "Edomites," which is the true reading, as is evident from 2Sa 8:14. This conquest, made by the army of David, was due to the skilful generalship and gallantry of Abishai and Joab. (1Ch 18:12; compare Ps 60:1, title.)

And as soon as he withdrew, the exiles would return to their old homes. To keep them, therefore, in entire subjection, the country was. held by strong garrisons, and the Edomites became David's servants, being apparently deprived for the present of any form of  independent government. We have, then, in this chapter, a brief summary of David's wars, whereby he established his supremacy ever the extensive region from Hamath on the north to the salt plains on the south of the Dead Sea, and from the Mediterranean to the Euphrates. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>And from the cities of Betach and Berothai David took very much brass, with which, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18-8.htm">1 Chronicles 18:8</a>, Solomon made the brazen sea, and the brazen columns and vessels of the temple. The lxx have also interpolated this notice into the text. The name Betach is given as Tibhath in the Chronicles; and for Berothai we have Chun. As the towns themselves are unknown, it cannot be decided with certainty which of the forms and names are the correct and original ones. &#1502;&#1489;&#1468;&#1496;&#1495; appears to have been written by mistake for &#1502;&#1496;&#1468;&#1489;&#1495;. This supposition is favoured by the rendering of the lxx, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x39c;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3ba;; and by that of the Syriac also (viz., Tebach). On the other hand, the occurrence of the name Tebah among the sons of Nahor the Aramaean in <a href="/genesis/22-24.htm">Genesis 22:24</a> proves little or nothing, as it is not known that he founded a family which perpetuated his name; nor can anything be inferred from the fact that, according to the more modern maps, there is a town of Tayibeh to the north of Damascus in 35 north lat., as there is very little in common between the names Tayibeh and Tebah. Ewald connects Berothai with the Barathena of Ptol. v. 19 in the neighbourhood of Saba. The connection is a possible one, but it is not sufficiently certain to warrant us in founding any conclusions upon it with regard to the name Chun which occurs in the Chronicles; so that there is no ground whatever for the opinion that it is a corruption of Berothai. </body></html>
