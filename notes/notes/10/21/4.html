God's judgments often look a great way back, which requires us to do so, when we are under his rebukes. It is not for us to object against the people's smarting for the sin of their king; perhaps they helped him. Nor against this generation suffering for the sin of the last. God often visits the sins of the fathers upon the children, and he gives no account of any matters. Time does not wear out the guilt of sin; nor can we build hopes of escape upon the delay of judgments. If we cannot understand all the reasons of Providence in this matter, still we have no right to demand that God should acquaint us with those reasons. It must be right, because it is the will of God, and in the end it will be proved to be so. Money is no satisfaction for blood. It should seem, Saul's posterity trod in his steps, for it is called a bloody house. It was the spirit of the family, therefore they are justly reckoned with for his sin, as well as for their own. The Gibeonites did not require this out of malice against Saul or his family. It was not to gratify any revenge, but for the public good. They were put to death at the beginning of harvest; they were thus sacrificed to turn away the wrath of Almighty God, who had withheld the harvest-mercies for some years past, and to obtain his favour in the present harvest. In vain do we expect mercy from God, unless we do justice upon our sins. Executions must not be thought cruel, which are for the public welfare.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>No silver, nor gold ... - Money payments as a compensation for blood-guilt were very common among many nations. The law, too, in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/35-31.htm">Numbers 35:31-32</a>, presupposes the existence of the custom which it prohibits. In like manner the speech of the Gibeonites implies that such a payment as they refuse would be a not unusual proceeding.<p>Neither ... shalt thou kill any man in Israel - They mean that it is not against the nation of Israel, but against the individual Saul, that they cry for vengeance. The demand for Saul's sons is exactly similar to that which dictated David's own expression in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-17.htm">2 Samuel 24:17</a>, "against me, and against my father's house." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. in his zeal to the children of Israel and Judah&#8212;Under pretense of a rigorous and faithful execution of the divine law regarding the extermination of the Canaanites, he set himself to expel or destroy those whom Joshua had been deceived into sparing. His real object seems to have been, that the possessions of the Gibeonites, being forfeited to the crown, might be divided among his own people (compare 1Sa 22:7). At all events, his proceeding against this people was in violation of a solemn oath, and involving national guilt. The famine was, in the wise and just retribution of Providence, made a national punishment, since the Hebrews either assisted in the massacre, or did not interpose to prevent it; since they neither endeavored to repair the wrong, nor expressed any horror of it; and since a general protracted chastisement might have been indispensable to inspire a proper respect and protection to the Gibeonite remnant that survived.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Any man in Israel; </span> except Saul’s family, as it here follows. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">What you shall say, </span> to wit, in any reason, and as far as God’s law will permit. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/21.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And, the Gibeonites said unto him,....

Money-compensation for murder is allowed by the laws of most nations in a primitive stage, e.g. of the ancient Germans (Tac. <span class="ital">Germ.</span> 21); the Anglo-Saxons; and the Arabs of the present day. It was expressly forbidden by the Mosaic Law (<a href="/context/numbers/35-31.htm" title="Moreover you shall take no satisfaction for the life of a murderer, which is guilty of death: but he shall be surely put to death....">Numbers 35:31-32</a>), because a mere money fine is insufficient to enforce strict regard for life, and such a custom may easily be abused by the rich.

As no distinction was drawn between murder and homicide, and as the nearest relative was bound in every case to revenge the blood shed, the custom of receiving a money compensation gradually grew up to prevent the tribe or nation being torn to pieces by interminable revenge. The Arabs still retain this usage, but it was forbidden by the Levitical Law (<a href="/numbers/35-31.htm">Numbers 35:31</a>), and rightly so, because a distinction was there made between murder and accidental bloodshed, and precautions taken for the rescue of one who had not acted with malice. <span class="cmt_word">Neither for us shalt thou kill any turn in Israel.</span> The singular is used at the beginning of their answer, in the same way as in <a href="/2_samuel/19-42.htm">2 Samuel 19:42, 43</a>. Literally their words are, <span class="accented">It is not to me a matter of silver and gold with Saul and his house, nor is it for us to put to death any one in Israel</span>; that is, "We refuse a money compensation, and it is beyond our power to exact the blood penalty which would gratify our anger." They make it quite plain that they do want blood, while the Authorized Version makes them say that they do not. The Revised Version more correctly translates, "Neither is it for us to put any man to death in Israel." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/20.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>David's Ministers of State. - The second section of the history of David's reign closes, like the first (<a href="/2_samuel/8-16.htm">2 Samuel 8:16</a>.), with a list of the leading ministers of state. The author evidently found the two lists in his sources, and included them both in his work, for the simple reason that they belonged to different periods, as the difference in the names of some of the officers clearly shows, and that they supplemented on another. The list before us belongs to a later period of David's reign than the one in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-16.htm">2 Samuel 8:16-18</a>. In addition to the office-bearers mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/8.htm">2 Samuel 8</a>, we find here Adoram over the tribute, and Ira the Kairite a confidential counsellor (cohen: see at <a href="/2_samuel/8-18.htm">2 Samuel 8:18</a>), in the place of the sons of David noticed in <a href="/2_samuel/8-18.htm">2 Samuel 8:18</a>. The others are the same in both lists. The Chethib &#1492;&#1499;&#1512;&#1497; is to be read &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497; (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/11-4.htm">2 Kings 11:4</a>, <a href="/2_kings/11-19.htm">2 Kings 11:19</a>), from &#1499;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, perfodit, and is synonymous with &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;&#1497; (see at <a href="/2_samuel/8-18.htm">2 Samuel 8:18</a>). Adoram is the same person as Adoniram, who is mentioned in <a href="/1_kings/4-6.htm">1 Kings 4:6</a> and <a href="/1_kings/5-14.htm">1 Kings 5:14</a> as overseer over the tributary service in the time of Solomon; as we may see from the fact, that the latter is also called Adoram in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/12-18.htm">1 Kings 12:18</a>, and Hadoram in <a href="/2_chronicles/10-18.htm">2 Chronicles 10:18</a>. Hadoram is apparently only a contracted form of the name, and not merely a copyist's mistake for Adoniram. But when we find that, according to the passage cited, the same man filled this office under three kings, we must bear in mind that he did not enter upon it till the close of David's reign, as he is not mentioned in <a href="/2_samuel/8-16.htm">2 Samuel 8:16</a>., and that his name only occurs in connection with Rehoboam's ascent of the throne; so that there is no ground for assuming that he filled the office for any length of time under that monarch. &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1505; does not mean vectigal, i.e., tribute or tributary service, but tributary labourers. The derivation of the word is uncertain, and has been disputed. The appointment of a special prefect over the tributary labourers can hardly have taken place before the closing years of David's reign, when the king organized the internal administration of the kingdom more firmly than before. On the tributary labourers, see at <a href="/1_kings/5-13.htm">1 Kings 5:13</a>. Ira the Jairite is never mentioned again. There is no ground for altering Jairi (the Jairite) into Jithri (the Jithrite), as Thenius proposes, since the rendering given in the Syriac ("from Jathir") is merely an inference from <a href="/2_samuel/23-38.htm">2 Samuel 23:38</a>; and the assumption upon which this conclusion is founded, viz., that Ira, the hero mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-38.htm">2 Samuel 23:38</a>, is the same person as Ira the royal cohen, is altogether unfounded. </body></html>
