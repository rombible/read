First, for "Jaare-oregim," <a href="/1_chronicles/20-5.htm">1 Chronicles 20:5</a> gives us the reading Jair. "Oregim" has evidently got in by a transcriber's error from the line below, where "oregim" is the Hebrew for "weavers." Again, the word the "Bethlehemite" is very doubtful. It is supported by <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-24.htm">2 Samuel 23:24</a>, but it is not found in the far purer text of <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/20-5.htm">1 Chronicles 20:5</a>, but instead of it we find the name of the Philistine slain by Elhanan, "Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite." It is probable, therefore, that either the words "the Bethlehemite," are a corruption of "Lahmi," or that the recurrence of "Lahmi," and the termination of "Beth-lehemite" has confused the transcriber, and led to the omission of one of the words in each text. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15-22. Moreover the Philistines had yet war again with Israel&#8212;Although the Philistines had completely succumbed to the army of David, yet the appearance of any gigantic champions among them revived their courage and stirred them up to renewed inroads on the Hebrew territory.

The words <span class="ital">the brother of</span> are conjecturally inserted in the E. V. from 1 Chron. They are not found here in the Hebrew text, or in any of the ancient versions. The parallel passage in <a href="/1_chronicles/20-5.htm" title="And there was war again with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son of Jair slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, whose spear staff was like a weaver's beam.">1 Chronicles 20:5</a> reads <span class="ital">and Elhanan the son of Jair slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite</span>. Now (1) the reading <span class="ital">Jair</span> is certainly preferable to <span class="ital">Jaare-oregim</span>. <span class="ital">Oregim</span>, the word for <span class="ital">weavers</span> in the line below, was inserted by a careless scribe, and the Hebrew letters of <span class="ital">Jair</span> (<span class="greekheb">יעיר</span>) transposed so as to read <span class="ital">Jaare</span> (<span class="greekheb">יערי</span>). (2) The letters of the words <span class="ital">Beth-lehemite, Goliath</span>, which stand together in the Heb. text, so closely resemble those of <span class="ital">Lahmi the brother of Goliath</span>, that it is almost certain that one reading is an accidental corruption of the other. But which is the original it is not easy to decide. There is no difficulty in supposing that another giant, beside the one slain by David, bore the name of Goliath. Another Elhanan of Beth-lehem is mentioned in ch. <a href="/2_samuel/23-24.htm" title="Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty; Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,">2 Samuel 23:24</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>There is a curious Jewish tradition, preserved in the Targum and by Jerome (<span class="ital">Quaest. Hebr. in libros Regum</span>), identifying Elhanan with David. The Targum here paraphrases thus: “And David, the son of Jesse the weaver of veils for the sanctuary, who was of Beth-lehem, slew Goliath the Gittite.” But there is no evidence whatever in support of this idea.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the staff of whose spear</span>, &c.] Cp. <a href="/1_samuel/17-7.htm" title="And the staff of his spear was like a weaver's beam; and his spear's head weighed six hundred shekels of iron: and one bearing a shield went before him.">1 Samuel 17:7</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/11-23.htm" title="And he slew an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits high; and in the Egyptian's hand was a spear like a weaver's beam; and he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear.">1 Chronicles 11:23</a>.

The Jewish Targum had the same reading as that still found in the text, but regards Elhanan, "God is gracious," as another name for David, and, instead of Jair or Jaare, reads Jesse. Its translation is as follows: "And David the son of Jesse, the weaver of veils for the sanctuary, who was of Bethlehem, slew Goliath the Gittite." Possibly the Authorized Version is right in concluding that the present text is a corruption of that in <a href="/1_chronicles/20-5.htm">1 Chronicles 20:5</a>. For, first, the repetition of <span class="accented">oregim</span>, "weavers," is suspicious, the Hebrew being, not "weaver's beam," but the plural "weavers' beam," <span class="accented">menor oregim.</span> Next, <span class="accented">Jaare</span> is a transposition of the letters of Jair (in the Hebrew) made probably in order that the compound <span class="accented">Jaare-oregim</span> may obey the rules of Hebrew grammar. More important is it to notice that <span class="accented">Lahmi</span> is part of the word "Bethlehemite" (Hebrew, <span class="accented">Beth-hallahmi</span>), and might thus easily suggest to the eye of a scribe the completion of so well known a word. We must add that among the thirty Gibborim is "Elhanan the son of <span class="accented">Dodo</span> of Bethlehem." Whoever slew Goliath's brother would certainly attain to high rank among the heroes, but if the name <span class="accented">Jair</span> is right, the Elhanan there spoken of is not the person who slew Lahmi. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/21.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When this touching care of Rizpah for the dead was told to David, he took care that the bones of the whole of the fallen royal house should be buried in the burial-place of Saul's family.
