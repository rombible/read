God's judgments often look a great way back, which requires us to do so, when we are under his rebukes. It is not for us to object against the people's smarting for the sin of their king; perhaps they helped him. Nor against this generation suffering for the sin of the last. God often visits the sins of the fathers upon the children, and he gives no account of any matters. Time does not wear out the guilt of sin; nor can we build hopes of escape upon the delay of judgments. If we cannot understand all the reasons of Providence in this matter, still we have no right to demand that God should acquaint us with those reasons. It must be right, because it is the will of God, and in the end it will be proved to be so. Money is no satisfaction for blood. It should seem, Saul's posterity trod in his steps, for it is called a bloody house. It was the spirit of the family, therefore they are justly reckoned with for his sin, as well as for their own. The Gibeonites did not require this out of malice against Saul or his family. It was not to gratify any revenge, but for the public good. They were put to death at the beginning of harvest; they were thus sacrificed to turn away the wrath of Almighty God, who had withheld the harvest-mercies for some years past, and to obtain his favour in the present harvest. In vain do we expect mercy from God, unless we do justice upon our sins. Executions must not be thought cruel, which are for the public welfare.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Lord's oath - The calamity brought upon Israel by Saul's breach of the oath to the Gibeonites would make David doubly careful in the matter of his own oath to Jonathan. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. Let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us, and we will hang them up unto the Lord in Gibeah of Saul&#8212;The practice of the Hebrews, as of most Oriental nations, was to slay first, and afterwards to suspend on a gibbet, the body not being left hanging after sunset. The king could not refuse this demand of the Gibeonites, who, in making it, were only exercising their right as blood-avengers; and, although through fear and a sense of weakness they had not hitherto claimed satisfaction, yet now that David had been apprised by the oracle of the cause of the long-prevailing calamity, he felt it his duty to give the Gibeonites full satisfaction&#8212;hence their specifying the number seven, which was reckoned full and complete. And if it should seem unjust to make the descendants suffer for a crime which, in all probability, originated with Saul himself, yet his sons and grandsons might be the instruments of his cruelty, the willing and zealous executors of this bloody raid.<p>the king said, I will give them&#8212;David cannot be charged with doing this as an indirect way or ridding himself of rival competitors for the throne, for those delivered up were only collateral branches of Saul's family, and never set up any claim to the sovereignty.

This occurrence certainly did not take place in the closing years of David's reign; on the other hand, it is evident from the remark in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-7.htm">2 Samuel 21:7</a>, to the effect that Mephibosheth was spared, that it happened after David had received tidings of Mephibosheth, and had taken him to his own table (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/9-1.htm">2 Samuel 9:1-13</a>). This is mentioned here as a practical illustration, on the one hand of the manner in which Jehovah visited upon the house of Saul, even after the death of Saul himself, a crime which had been committed by him; and, on the other hand, of the way in which, even in such a case as this, when David had been obliged to sacrifice the descendants of Saul to expiate the guilt of their father, he showed his tenderness towards him by the honourable burial of their bones.<p><a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-1.htm">2 Samuel 21:1-6</a><p>A famine, which lasted for three successive years, induced David to seek the face of Jehovah, i.e., to approach God in prayer and ask the cause of this judgment which had fallen upon the land. The Lord replied, "Because of Saul, and because of the house of blood-guiltiness, because he hath slain the Gibeonites." The expression "because of the house of blood-guiltiness" is in apposition to "Saul," and determines the meaning more precisely: "because of Saul, and indeed because of the blood-guiltiness which rests upon his house." &#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; signifies the house upon which blood that had been shed still rested as guilt, like &#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1506;&#1497;&#1512; in <a href="/ezekiel/22-2.htm">Ezekiel 22:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-6.htm">Ezekiel 24:6</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-9.htm">Ezekiel 24:9</a>, and &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; in <a href="/psalms/5-7.htm">Psalm 5:7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/27-9.htm">Psalm 27:9</a>, etc. Nothing further is known about the fact itself. It is simply evident from the words of the Gibeonites in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-5.htm">2 Samuel 21:5</a>, that Saul, in his pretended zeal for the children of Israel, had smitten the Gibeonites, i.e., had put them to death. Probably some dissatisfaction with them had furnished Saul with a pretext for exterminating these Amoritish heathen from the midst of the people of God.</body></html>
