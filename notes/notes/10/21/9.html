God's judgments often look a great way back, which requires us to do so, when we are under his rebukes. It is not for us to object against the people's smarting for the sin of their king; perhaps they helped him. Nor against this generation suffering for the sin of the last. God often visits the sins of the fathers upon the children, and he gives no account of any matters. Time does not wear out the guilt of sin; nor can we build hopes of escape upon the delay of judgments. If we cannot understand all the reasons of Providence in this matter, still we have no right to demand that God should acquaint us with those reasons. It must be right, because it is the will of God, and in the end it will be proved to be so. Money is no satisfaction for blood. It should seem, Saul's posterity trod in his steps, for it is called a bloody house. It was the spirit of the family, therefore they are justly reckoned with for his sin, as well as for their own. The Gibeonites did not require this out of malice against Saul or his family. It was not to gratify any revenge, but for the public good. They were put to death at the beginning of harvest; they were thus sacrificed to turn away the wrath of Almighty God, who had withheld the harvest-mercies for some years past, and to obtain his favour in the present harvest. In vain do we expect mercy from God, unless we do justice upon our sins. Executions must not be thought cruel, which are for the public welfare.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In the first days - The barley harvest (about the middle or toward the end of April) was earlier than the wheat harvest <a href="/exodus/9-31.htm">Exodus 9:31</a>; <a href="/ruth/1-22.htm">Ruth 1:22</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. they hanged them in the hill before the Lord&#8212;Deeming themselves not bound by the criminal law of Israel (De 21:22, 23), their intention was to let the bodies hang until God, propitiated by this offering, should send rain upon the land, for the want of it had occasioned the famine. It was a heathen practice to gibbet men with a view of appeasing the anger of the gods in seasons of famine, and the Gibeonites, who were a remnant of the Amorites (2Sa 21:2), though brought to the knowledge of the true God, were not, it seems, free from this superstition. God, in His providence, suffered the Gibeonites to ask and inflict so barbarous a retaliation, in order that the oppressed Gibeonites might obtain justice and some reparation of their wrongs, especially that the scandal brought on the name of the true religion by the violation of a solemn national compact might be wiped away from Israel, and that a memorable lesson should be given to respect treaties and oaths.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">He delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Quest.</span> How could David do this, when he had sworn that he would not cut off Saul’s seed, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/1_samuel/24-21.htm" title="Swear now therefore to me by the LORD, that you will not cut off my seed after me, and that you will not destroy my name out of my father's house.">1 Samuel 24:21</a>,22</span>? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Answ.</span> Because he had special warrant and direction from God about it, who, as all confess, can dispense with men’s oaths and with his own laws when he sees fit.
