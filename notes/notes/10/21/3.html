God's judgments often look a great way back, which requires us to do so, when we are under his rebukes. It is not for us to object against the people's smarting for the sin of their king; perhaps they helped him. Nor against this generation suffering for the sin of the last. God often visits the sins of the fathers upon the children, and he gives no account of any matters. Time does not wear out the guilt of sin; nor can we build hopes of escape upon the delay of judgments. If we cannot understand all the reasons of Providence in this matter, still we have no right to demand that God should acquaint us with those reasons. It must be right, because it is the will of God, and in the end it will be proved to be so. Money is no satisfaction for blood. It should seem, Saul's posterity trod in his steps, for it is called a bloody house. It was the spirit of the family, therefore they are justly reckoned with for his sin, as well as for their own. The Gibeonites did not require this out of malice against Saul or his family. It was not to gratify any revenge, but for the public good. They were put to death at the beginning of harvest; they were thus sacrificed to turn away the wrath of Almighty God, who had withheld the harvest-mercies for some years past, and to obtain his favour in the present harvest. In vain do we expect mercy from God, unless we do justice upon our sins. Executions must not be thought cruel, which are for the public welfare.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The way in which the writer here refers to the history of the league with the Gibeonites <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/9.htm">Joshua 9</a> shows that the Book of Joshua was not a part of the same work as the Books of Samuel.<p>Of the Amorites - The Gibeonites were Hivites <a href="/joshua/9-7.htm">Joshua 9:7</a>; <a href="/joshua/11-19.htm">Joshua 11:19</a>; and in many enumerations of the Canaanite nations the Hivites are distinguished from the Amorites.

His real object seems to have been, that the possessions of the Gibeonites, being forfeited to the crown, might be divided among his own people (compare 1Sa 22:7). At all events, his proceeding against this people was in violation of a solemn oath, and involving national guilt. The famine was, in the wise and just retribution of Providence, made a national punishment, since the Hebrews either assisted in the massacre, or did not interpose to prevent it; since they neither endeavored to repair the wrong, nor expressed any horror of it; and since a general protracted chastisement might have been indispensable to inspire a proper respect and protection to the Gibeonite remnant that survived.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Unto the Gibeonites; </span> to some of the chief of them, who were to impart it to the rest. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">What shall I do for you?</span> what satisfaction do you expect or require for the injuries formerly done to you? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">That ye may bless the inheritance of the Lord; </span> that by your acknowledgment of satisfaction received, the guilt and curse may be removed from the land and people of God, and by this means, as also by your prayers, God may be reconciled, and may restore his blessing of plenty to us, which hitherto he hath denied us. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/21.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Wherefore David said unto the Gibeonites, what shall I do for you,....

The author evidently found the two lists in his sources, and included them both in his work, for the simple reason that they belonged to different periods, as the difference in the names of some of the officers clearly shows, and that they supplemented on another. The list before us belongs to a later period of David's reign than the one in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-16.htm">2 Samuel 8:16-18</a>. In addition to the office-bearers mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/8.htm">2 Samuel 8</a>, we find here Adoram over the tribute, and Ira the Kairite a confidential counsellor (cohen: see at <a href="/2_samuel/8-18.htm">2 Samuel 8:18</a>), in the place of the sons of David noticed in <a href="/2_samuel/8-18.htm">2 Samuel 8:18</a>. The others are the same in both lists. The Chethib &#1492;&#1499;&#1512;&#1497; is to be read &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497; (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/11-4.htm">2 Kings 11:4</a>, <a href="/2_kings/11-19.htm">2 Kings 11:19</a>), from &#1499;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, perfodit, and is synonymous with &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;&#1497; (see at <a href="/2_samuel/8-18.htm">2 Samuel 8:18</a>). Adoram is the same person as Adoniram, who is mentioned in <a href="/1_kings/4-6.htm">1 Kings 4:6</a> and <a href="/1_kings/5-14.htm">1 Kings 5:14</a> as overseer over the tributary service in the time of Solomon; as we may see from the fact, that the latter is also called Adoram in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/12-18.htm">1 Kings 12:18</a>, and Hadoram in <a href="/2_chronicles/10-18.htm">2 Chronicles 10:18</a>. Hadoram is apparently only a contracted form of the name, and not merely a copyist's mistake for Adoniram. But when we find that, according to the passage cited, the same man filled this office under three kings, we must bear in mind that he did not enter upon it till the close of David's reign, as he is not mentioned in <a href="/2_samuel/8-16.htm">2 Samuel 8:16</a>., and that his name only occurs in connection with Rehoboam's ascent of the throne; so that there is no ground for assuming that he filled the office for any length of time under that monarch. &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1505; does not mean vectigal, i.e., tribute or tributary service, but tributary labourers. The derivation of the word is uncertain, and has been disputed. The appointment of a special prefect over the tributary labourers can hardly have taken place before the closing years of David's reign, when the king organized the internal administration of the kingdom more firmly than before. On the tributary labourers, see at <a href="/1_kings/5-13.htm">1 Kings 5:13</a>. Ira the Jairite is never mentioned again. There is no ground for altering Jairi (the Jairite) into Jithri (the Jithrite), as Thenius proposes, since the rendering given in the Syriac ("from Jathir") is merely an inference from <a href="/2_samuel/23-38.htm">2 Samuel 23:38</a>; and the assumption upon which this conclusion is founded, viz., that Ira, the hero mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-38.htm">2 Samuel 23:38</a>, is the same person as Ira the royal cohen, is altogether unfounded. </body></html>
