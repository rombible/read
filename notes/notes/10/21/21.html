David fainted, but he did not flee, and God sent help in the time of need. In spiritual conflicts, even strong saints sometimes wax faint; then Satan attacks them furiously; but those who stand their ground and resist him, shall be relieved and made more than conquerors.

First, for "Jaare-oregim," <a href="/1_chronicles/20-5.htm">1 Chronicles 20:5</a> gives us the reading Jair. "Oregim" has evidently got in by a transcriber's error from the line below, where "oregim" is the Hebrew for "weavers." Again, the word the "Bethlehemite" is very doubtful. It is supported by <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-24.htm">2 Samuel 23:24</a>, but it is not found in the far purer text of <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/20-5.htm">1 Chronicles 20:5</a>, but instead of it we find the name of the Philistine slain by Elhanan, "Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite." It is probable, therefore, that either the words "the Bethlehemite," are a corruption of "Lahmi," or that the recurrence of "Lahmi," and the termination of "Beth-lehemite" has confused the transcriber, and led to the omission of one of the words in each text. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15-22. Moreover the Philistines had yet war again with Israel&#8212;Although the Philistines had completely succumbed to the army of David, yet the appearance of any gigantic champions among them revived their courage and stirred them up to renewed inroads on the Hebrew territory. Four successive contests they provoked during the latter period of David's reign, in the first of which the king ran so imminent a risk of his life that he was no longer allowed to encounter the perils of the battlefield.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/21.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And when he defied Israel,....

This may be gathered from the books of the Chronicles, where three of the heroic feats mentioned here are attached to the general survey of David's wars (vid., <a href="/1_chronicles/20-4.htm">1 Chronicles 20:4</a>). David was exhausted in this fight, and a Philistian giant thought to slay him; but Abishai came to his help and slew the giant. He was called Yishbo benob (Keri, Yishbi), i.e., not Yishbo at Nob, but Yishbobenob, a proper name, the meaning of which is probably "his dwelling is on the height," and which may have been given to him because of his inaccessible castle. He was one of the descendants of Raphah, i.e., one of the gigantic race of Rephaim. Raphah was the tribe-father of the Rephaim, an ancient tribe of gigantic stature, of whom only a few families were left even in Moses' time (vid., <a href="/deuteronomy/2-11.htm">Deuteronomy 2:11</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-11.htm">Deuteronomy 3:11</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-13.htm">Deuteronomy 3:13</a>, and the commentary on <a href="/genesis/14-5.htm">Genesis 14:5</a>). The weight of his lance, i.e., of the metal point to his lance, was three hundred shekels, or eight pounds, of brass, half as much as the spear of Goliath (<a href="/1_samuel/17-7.htm">1 Samuel 17:7</a>); "and he was girded with new armour." Bttcher has no doubt given the correct explanation of the word &#1495;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;; he supposes the feminine to be used in a collective sense, so that the noun ("armour," &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;) could be dispensed with. (For parallels both to the words and facts, vid., <a href="/judges/18-11.htm">Judges 18:11</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/1-41.htm">Deuteronomy 1:41</a>.) &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;, he said (sc., to himself), i.e., he thought.</body></html>
