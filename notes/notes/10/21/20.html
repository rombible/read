Indeed he contributed by his hand to the death of one of them; while maintaining a fight with him, he gave Abishai the easier opportunity of killing him.

David fainted, but he did not flee, and God sent help in the time of need. In spiritual conflicts, even strong saints sometimes wax faint; then Satan attacks them furiously; but those who stand their ground and resist him, shall be relieved and made more than conquerors. Death is a Christian's last enemy, and a son of Anak; but through Him that triumphed for us, believers shall be more than conquerors at last, even over that enemy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Hebrew text is manifestly very corrupt. First, for "Jaare-oregim," <a href="/1_chronicles/20-5.htm">1 Chronicles 20:5</a> gives us the reading Jair. "Oregim" has evidently got in by a transcriber's error from the line below, where "oregim" is the Hebrew for "weavers." Again, the word the "Bethlehemite" is very doubtful. It is supported by <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-24.htm">2 Samuel 23:24</a>, but it is not found in the far purer text of <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/20-5.htm">1 Chronicles 20:5</a>, but instead of it we find the name of the Philistine slain by Elhanan, "Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite." It is probable, therefore, that either the words "the Bethlehemite," are a corruption of "Lahmi," or that the recurrence of "Lahmi," and the termination of "Beth-lehemite" has confused the transcriber, and led to the omission of one of the words in each text. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15-22. Moreover the Philistines had yet war again with Israel&#8212;Although the Philistines had completely succumbed to the army of David, yet the appearance of any gigantic champions among them revived their courage and stirred them up to renewed inroads on the Hebrew territory. Four successive contests they provoked during the latter period of David's reign, in the first of which the king ran so imminent a risk of his life that he was no longer allowed to encounter the perils of the battlefield.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">In Gath, </span> i. e. in the territory of the city of Gath; which circumstance intimates that this, and consequently the other battles here described, were fought before David had taken Gath out of the hands of the Philistines, which he did <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/2_samuel/8-1.htm" title="And after this it came to pass that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them: and David took Methegammah out of the hand of the Philistines.">2 Samuel 8:1</a></span>, compared with <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/1_chronicles/18-1.htm" title="Now after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them, and took Gath and her towns out of the hand of the Philistines.">1 Chronicles 18:1</a></span>, and therefore not in the last days of David, as some conceive from their mention in this place. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">A man of great stature, </span> or, <span class="ital">a man of Middin or Madon</span>, as the LXX. render it; so called from the place of his birth, as <span class="ital">Goliath</span> is said to be of Gath for the same reason. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/21.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And there was yet a battle in Gath,....

Pliny (a) speaks of one M. Curiatius, a patrician, who had two daughters that had six fingers on an hand, and were called "Sedigitae", six-fingered; and of Volcatius, a famous poet, called "Sedigitus", or six-fingered, for the same reason; and elsewhere, from other writers (b) he makes mention of a people that had eight toes each foot; so Ctesias (c) speaks of a people in the mountains of India, which have eight fingers on each hand, and eight toes on each foot, both men and women: <p>and he also was born to the giant; a son of a giant. <p>(a) Nat.

He therefore sent for the bones of Saul and Jonathan, which the men of Jabesh had taken away secretly from the wall of Beisan, where the Philistines had fastened the bodies, and which had been buried in Jabesh (<a href="/1_samuel/31-10.htm">1 Samuel 31:10</a>.), and had the bones of the sons and grandsons of Saul who had been crucified at Gibeah collected together, and interred all these bones at Zela in the land of Benjamin, in the family grave of Kish the father of Saul. &#1490;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1489;, to take away secretly. &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1503; &#1502;&#1468;&#1512;&#1495;&#1489;, from the market-place of Bethshan, does not present any contradiction to the statement in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-10.htm">1 Samuel 31:10</a>, that the Philistines fastened the body to the wall of Bethshan, as the rechob or market-place in eastern towns is not in the middle of the town, but is an open place against or in front of the gate (cf. <a href="/2_chronicles/32-6.htm">2 Chronicles 32:6</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-1.htm">Nehemiah 8:1</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-3.htm">Nehemiah 8:3</a>,<a href="/nehemiah/8-16.htm">Nehemiah 8:16</a>). This place, as the common meeting-place of the citizens, was the most suitable spot that the Philistines could find for fastening the bodies to the wall. The Chethib &#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; is the true Hebrew form from &#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;, whereas the Keri &#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; is a formation resembling the Aramaean (cf. Ewald, 252, a.). The Keri &#1508;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; is correct, however, as &#1508;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, being a proper name, does not take any article. In &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493;&#1501; the literal meaning of &#1497;&#1493;&#1501; (day) must not be strictly pressed, but the expression is to be taken in the sense of "at the time of the smiting;" for the hanging up of the bodies did not take place till the day after the battle (<a href="/1_samuel/31-8.htm">1 Samuel 31:8</a>.). - In <a href="/2_samuel/21-14.htm">2 Samuel 21:14</a> the account is abridged, and the bones of the crucified persons are not mentioned again. The situation of Zela is unknown (see at <a href="/joshua/18-28.htm">Joshua 18:28</a>). After this had been carried out in accordance with the king's command, God suffered himself to be entreated for the land, so that the famine ceased. </body></html>
