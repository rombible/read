An Arab in misfortune says, “Fate has put out my lamp.” Cp. <a href="/job/18-6.htm" title="The light shall be dark in his tabernacle, and his candle shall be put out with him.">Job 18:6</a>; <a href="/proverbs/13-9.htm" title="The light of the righteous rejoices: but the lamp of the wicked shall be put out.">Proverbs 13:9</a>. The expression <span class="ital">light of Israel</span> seems to indicate that David was already king of all Israel, and if so, the incident may have happened in one of the wars recorded in ch. <a href="/context/2_samuel/5-17.htm" title="But when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines came up to seek David; and David heard of it, and went down to the hold....">2 Samuel 5:17-25</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The men of David sware unto him.</span> David's men were specifically the mighties, who had so long been his friends and companions.

In <a href="/job/18-5.htm">Job 18:5, 6</a> the extinction of the lamp signifies the destruction of the family. David was evidently now king, and under him Israel was advancing to freedom and empire.

He therefore sent for the bones of Saul and Jonathan, which the men of Jabesh had taken away secretly from the wall of Beisan, where the Philistines had fastened the bodies, and which had been buried in Jabesh (<a href="/1_samuel/31-10.htm">1 Samuel 31:10</a>.), and had the bones of the sons and grandsons of Saul who had been crucified at Gibeah collected together, and interred all these bones at Zela in the land of Benjamin, in the family grave of Kish the father of Saul. &#1490;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1489;, to take away secretly. &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1503; &#1502;&#1468;&#1512;&#1495;&#1489;, from the market-place of Bethshan, does not present any contradiction to the statement in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-10.htm">1 Samuel 31:10</a>, that the Philistines fastened the body to the wall of Bethshan, as the rechob or market-place in eastern towns is not in the middle of the town, but is an open place against or in front of the gate (cf. <a href="/2_chronicles/32-6.htm">2 Chronicles 32:6</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-1.htm">Nehemiah 8:1</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-3.htm">Nehemiah 8:3</a>,<a href="/nehemiah/8-16.htm">Nehemiah 8:16</a>). This place, as the common meeting-place of the citizens, was the most suitable spot that the Philistines could find for fastening the bodies to the wall. The Chethib &#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; is the true Hebrew form from &#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;, whereas the Keri &#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; is a formation resembling the Aramaean (cf.

The Keri &#1508;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; is correct, however, as &#1508;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, being a proper name, does not take any article. In &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493;&#1501; the literal meaning of &#1497;&#1493;&#1501; (day) must not be strictly pressed, but the expression is to be taken in the sense of "at the time of the smiting;" for the hanging up of the bodies did not take place till the day after the battle (<a href="/1_samuel/31-8.htm">1 Samuel 31:8</a>.). - In <a href="/2_samuel/21-14.htm">2 Samuel 21:14</a> the account is abridged, and the bones of the crucified persons are not mentioned again. The situation of Zela is unknown (see at <a href="/joshua/18-28.htm">Joshua 18:28</a>). After this had been carried out in accordance with the king's command, God suffered himself to be entreated for the land, so that the famine ceased. </body></html>
