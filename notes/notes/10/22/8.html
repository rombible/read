They that trust God in the way of duty, shall find him a present help in their greatest dangers: David did so. Remarkable preservations should be particularly mentioned in our praises. We shall never be delivered from all enemies till we get to heaven. God will preserve all his people, 2Ti 4:18. Those who receive signal mercies from God, ought to give him the glory. In the day that God delivered David, he sang this song. While the mercy is fresh, and we are most affected with it, let the thank-offering be brought, to be kindled with the fire of that affection. All his joys and hopes close, as all our hopes should do, in the great Redeemer.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This song, which is found with scarcely any material variation as <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/18.htm">Psalm 18</a>, and with the words of this first verse for its title, belongs to the early part of David's reign when he was recently established upon the throne of all Israel, and when his final triumph over the house of Saul, and over the pagan nations <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-44.htm">2 Samuel 22:44-46</a>, Philistines, Moabites, Syrians, Ammonites, and Edomites, was still fresh <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/21.htm">2 Samuel 21</a>.

David's Psalm of Thanksgiving for God's Powerful Deliverance and Manifold Blessings.<p>The song contained in this chapter is the same as the eighteenth Psalm, where the full commentary will be given [see on [278]Ps 18:1, &c.]. It may be sufficient simply to remark that Jewish writers have noticed a great number of very minute variations in the language of the song as recorded here, from that embodied in the Book of Psalms&#8212;which may be accounted for by the fact that this, the first copy of the poem, was carefully revised and altered by David afterwards, when it was set to the music of the tabernacle. This inspired ode was manifestly the effusion of a mind glowing with the highest fervor of piety and gratitude, and it is full of the noblest imagery that is to be found within the range even of sacred poetry. It is David's grand tribute of thanksgiving for deliverance from his numerous and powerful enemies, and establishing him in the power and glory of the kingdom.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/22.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/22.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of heaven moved and shook, because he was wroth.

The manifestation of Jehovah for the discomfiture of David’s enemies<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Earthquake and storm are regarded as the visible manifestations of Divine Power: and therefore God’s interposition for the deliverance of His servant from the perils that surrounded him is described as accompanied by terrible phenomena in nature. We have here an ideal description of a Theophany, based on the description of the Theophany at Sinai. See <a href="/context/exodus/19-16.htm" title="And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightning, and a thick cloud on the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that was in the camp trembled....">Exodus 19:16-18</a>; and cp. <a href="/psalms/68-8.htm" title="The earth shook, the heavens also dropped at the presence of God: even Sinai itself was moved at the presence of God, the God of Israel.">Psalm 68:8</a>; <a href="/context/psalms/77-16.htm" title="The waters saw you, O God, the waters saw you; they were afraid: the depths also were troubled....">Psalm 77:16-18</a>; <a href="/context/judges/5-4.htm" title="LORD, when you went out of Seir, when you marched out of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, and the heavens dropped, the clouds also dropped water....">Jdg 5:4-5</a>. It is not indeed impossible that David refers to some occasion when his enemies were scattered by the breaking of a terrible storm (cp. <a href="/joshua/10-11.htm" title="And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, and were in the going down to Bethhoron, that the LORD cast down great stones from heaven on them to Azekah, and they died: they were more which died with hailstones than they whom the children of Israel slew with the sword.">Joshua 10:11</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/7-10.htm" title="And as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel: but the LORD thundered with a great thunder on that day on the Philistines, and discomfited them; and they were smitten before Israel.">1 Samuel 7:10</a>): but we have no record of such an event having actually happened in his life; and in any case the picture is designed to serve as a description of God’s intervention for his deliverance in general, and not upon any single occasion.

But the poetic vigour of David's imagination intensities the imagery, and makes it more grand and startling. Not merely is there the earthquake and the volcano and the storm cloud, but the dim form of the Almighty is present, with the smoke of just anger at unrighteousness ascending from his nostrils, and the lightnings flashing forth to execute his wrath. But David certainly intended that these metaphors should remain ideal; and it was quite unnecessary for the Targum carefully to eliminate all such expressions as seem to give the Almighty bureau shape. In so doing it merely changes poetry into prose. But even more dull and commonplace is the explanation given by some modern commentators, that all that is meant is that David was once saved by a thunderstorm from some danger or other. Really this glorious imagery, taken from all that is grandest on earth, is intended to magnify to us the spiritual conception of God's justice coming forth to visit the earth and do right and equity. In ver. 8 for "the foundations of the heavens," we find in <a href="/psalms/18-7.htm">Psalm 18:7</a> "the foundations of the hills." The former is the grander metaphor, and signifies the mighty mountain ranges, like those of Lebanon, on which the skies seem to rest. <span class="cmt_word">The smoke</span> signifies hailstorms and, perhaps, also the rain driven in wreaths along the ground by the wind. <span class="cmt_word">Red hot cinders burned from him</span> describes the flashing lightnings that were shot forth like the coals from the refiner's furnace when heated to the full. It is to be regretted that the Revised Version retains the bathos of the old rendering, that God's fiery breath set coals on fire. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/22.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div><a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-2.htm">2 Samuel 22:2-4</a> form the introduction.<p>  2  Jehovah is my rock, my castle, and my deliverer to me;<p>  3  My Rock-God, in whom I:trust:<p>My shield and horn of my salvation, my fortress and my refuge,<p>My Saviour; from violence Thou redeemest me.<p>  4  I call upon the praised one, Jehovah,<p>And I am saved from my enemies.<p>This introduction contains the sum and substance of the whole psalm, inasmuch as David groups the many experiences of divine deliverance in his agitated life into a long series of predicates, in all of which he extols God as his defence, refuge, and deliverer. The heaping up of these predicates is an expression both of liveliest gratitude, and also of hope for the future. The different predicates, however, are not to be taken as in apposition to Jehovah, or as vocatives, but are declarations concerning God, how He had proved himself faithful to the Psalmist in all the calamities of his life, and would assuredly do so still. David calls God &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1510;&#1512;&#1514;&#1497; &#1505;&#1500;&#1506;&#1497; (my rock, and my castle) in <a href="/psalms/31-4.htm">Psalm 31:4</a> as well (cf. <a href="/psalms/71-4.htm">Psalm 71:4</a>). The two epithets are borrowed from the natural character of Palestine, where steep and almost inaccessible rocks afford protection to the fugitive, as David had often found at the time when Saul was pursuing him (vid., <a href="/1_samuel/24-22.htm">1 Samuel 24:22</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/22-5.htm">1 Samuel 22:5</a>). But whilst David took refuge in rocks, he placed his hopes of safety not in their inaccessible character, but in God the Lord, the eternal spiritual rock, whom he could see in the earthly rock, so that he called Him his true castle. &#1500;&#1497; &#1502;&#1508;&#1500;&#1496;&#1497; (my deliverer to me) gives the real explanation of the foregoing figures. The &#1500;&#1497; (to me) is omitted in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>, and only serves to strengthen the suffix, "my, yea my deliverer.' "My Rock-God," equivalent to, God who is my Rock: this is formed after <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-4.htm">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>, where Moses calls the Lord the Rock of Israel, because of His unchangeable faithfulness; for zur, a rock, is a figure used to represent immoveable firmness. In <a href="/psalms/18-3.htm">Psalm 18:3</a> we find &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497; &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;, "my God" (strong one), "my rock," two synonyms which are joined together in our text, so as to form one single predicate of God, which is repeated in <a href="/2_samuel/22-47.htm">2 Samuel 22:47</a>. The predicates which follow, "my horn and my salvation-shield," describe God as the mighty protector and defender of the righteous. A shield covers against hostile attacks. In this respect God was Abraham's shield (<a href="/genesis/15-1.htm">Genesis 15:1</a>), and the helping shield of Israel (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-29.htm">Deuteronomy 33:29</a>; cf. <a href="/psalms/3-4.htm">Psalm 3:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/59-12.htm">Psalm 59:12</a>). He is the "horn of salvation," according to Luther, because He overcomes enemies, and rescues from foes, and gives salvation. The figure is borrowed from animals, which have their strength and defensive weapons in their horns (see at <a href="/1_samuel/2-1.htm">1 Samuel 2:1</a>). "My fortress:" misgab is a high place, where a person is secure against hostile attacks (see at <a href="/psalms/9-10.htm">Psalm 9:10</a>). The predicates which follow, viz., my refuge, etc., are not given in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/18-3.htm">Psalm 18:3</a>, and are probably only added as a rhythmical completion to the strophe, which was shortened by the omission of the introductory lines, "I love thee heartily, Jehovah" (<a href="/psalms/18-1.htm">Psalm 18:1</a>). The last clause, "My Saviour, who redeemest me from violence," corresponds to &#1488;&#1495;&#1505;&#1492;&#1470;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493; in the first hemistich. In <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/18-4.htm">Psalm 18:4</a>, David sums up the contents of his psalm of thanksgiving in a general sentence of experience, which may be called the theme of the psalm, for it embraces "the result of the long life which lay behind him, so full of dangers and deliverances." &#1502;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500;, "the praised one," an epithet applied to God, which occurs several times in the Psalms (<a href="/psalms/48-2.htm">Psalm 48:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/96-4.htm">Psalm 96:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/113-3.htm">Psalm 113:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/145-3.htm">Psalm 145:3</a>). It is in apposition to Jehovah, and is placed first for the sake of emphasis: "I invoke Jehovah as the praised one." The imperfects &#1488;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488; and &#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; are used to denote what continually happens. In <a href="/2_samuel/22-5.htm">2 Samuel 22:5</a> we have the commencement of the account of the deliverances out of great tribulations, which David had experienced at the hand of God. </body></html>
