They that trust God in the way of duty, shall find him a present help in their greatest dangers: David did so. Remarkable preservations should be particularly mentioned in our praises. We shall never be delivered from all enemies till we get to heaven. God will preserve all his people, 2Ti 4:18. Those who receive signal mercies from God, ought to give him the glory. In the day that God delivered David, he sang this song. While the mercy is fresh, and we are most affected with it, let the thank-offering be brought, to be kindled with the fire of that affection. All his joys and hopes close, as all our hopes should do, in the great Redeemer.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This song, which is found with scarcely any material variation as <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/18.htm">Psalm 18</a>, and with the words of this first verse for its title, belongs to the early part of David's reign when he was recently established upon the throne of all Israel, and when his final triumph over the house of Saul, and over the pagan nations <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-44.htm">2 Samuel 22:44-46</a>, Philistines, Moabites, Syrians, Ammonites, and Edomites, was still fresh <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/21.htm">2 Samuel 21</a>.

The insertion of this Psalm, which is not in the Book of Psalms, was probably suggested by the insertion of the long Psalm in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/22.htm">2 Samuel 22</a>.<p>David the son of Jesse said ... - The original word for "said" is used between 200 and 300 times in the phrase, "saith the Lord," designating the word of God in the mouth of the prophet. It is only applied to the words of a man here, and in the strikingly similar passage <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/24-3.htm">Numbers 24:3-4</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/24-15.htm">Numbers 24:15-16</a>, and in <a href="/proverbs/30-1.htm">Proverbs 30:1</a>; and in all these places the words spoken are inspired words. The description of David is divided into four clauses, which correspond to and balance each other. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 22<p>2Sa 22:1-51. David's Psalm of Thanksgiving for God's Powerful Deliverance and Manifold Blessings.<p>The song contained in this chapter is the same as the eighteenth Psalm, where the full commentary will be given [see on [278]Ps 18:1, &c.]. It may be sufficient simply to remark that Jewish writers have noticed a great number of very minute variations in the language of the song as recorded here, from that embodied in the Book of Psalms&#8212;which may be accounted for by the fact that this, the first copy of the poem, was carefully revised and altered by David afterwards, when it was set to the music of the tabernacle. This inspired ode was manifestly the effusion of a mind glowing with the highest fervor of piety and gratitude, and it is full of the noblest imagery that is to be found within the range even of sacred poetry. It is David's grand tribute of thanksgiving for deliverance from his numerous and powerful enemies, and establishing him in the power and glory of the kingdom.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/22.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/22.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Strangers shall fade away, and they shall be afraid out of their close places.

But the word may also be explained according to the slightly different reading of <a href="/psalms/18-45.htm" title="The strangers shall fade away, and be afraid out of their close places.">Psalm 18:45</a>, <span class="bld">came trembling out of their fastnesses</span>, terrified into surrendering at discretion to the triumphant invader.

Consequently it is quite out of the question to take the other verbs as preterites. We are not compelled to do this by the interchange of imperfects c. vav consec. with simple imperfects, as the vav consec. is not used exclusively as expressive of the past. On the contrary, the substance of the whole of the following description shows very clearly that David refers not only to the victories he has already won, but in general to the defeat of all his foes in the past, the present, and the future; for he speaks as distinctly as possible not only of their entire destruction (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-38.htm">2 Samuel 22:38</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-39.htm">2 Samuel 22:39</a>, <a href="/2_samuel/22-43.htm">2 Samuel 22:43</a>), but also of the fact that God makes him the head of the nations, and distant and foreign nations to him homage. Consequently he refers not only to his own personal dominion, but also, on the strength of the promise which he had received from God, to the increase of the dominion of the throne of his house, whilst he proclaims in the Spirit the ultimate defeat of all the enemies of the kingdom of God. This Messianic element in the following description comes out in a way that cannot be mistaken, in the praise of the Lord with which he concludes in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-47.htm">2 Samuel 22:47-51</a>. &#1493;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1491;&#1501;, "I destroy them," is stronger than &#1493;&#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1497;&#1490;&#1501;, "I reach them" (in the psalm). In <a href="/2_samuel/22-39.htm">2 Samuel 22:39</a> the words are crowded together, to express the utter destruction of all foes. In the psalm &#1493;&#1488;&#1499;&#1500;&#1468;&#1501; is omitted. &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1494;&#1512;&#1504;&#1497; for &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1494;&#1468;&#1512;&#1504;&#1497; in the psalm is not a poetical Syriasm, and still less a "careless solecism" (Hupfeld), but a simple contraction, such as we meet with in many forms: e.g., &#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1508;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; for &#1502;&#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1508;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; (<a href="/job/35-11.htm">Job 35:11</a>; cf. Ewald, 232, b.). The form &#1514;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; for &#1504;&#1514;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; (in the psalm) is unusual, and the aphaeresis of the &#1504; can only be accounted for from the fact that this much-used word constantly drops its &#1504; as a radical sound in the imperfect (see Ewald, 195, c.). The phrase &#1506;&#1512;&#1507; &#1500;&#1468;&#1497; &#1514;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; is formed after <a href="/exodus/23-27.htm">Exodus 23:27</a>. "Giving the enemy to a person's back" means causing them to turn the back, i.e., putting them to flight. </body></html>
