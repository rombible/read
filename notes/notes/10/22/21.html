They that trust God in the way of duty, shall find him a present help in their greatest dangers: David did so. Remarkable preservations should be particularly mentioned in our praises. We shall never be delivered from all enemies till we get to heaven. God will preserve all his people, 2Ti 4:18. Those who receive signal mercies from God, ought to give him the glory. In the day that God delivered David, he sang this song. While the mercy is fresh, and we are most affected with it, let the thank-offering be brought, to be kindled with the fire of that affection. All his joys and hopes close, as all our hopes should do, in the great Redeemer.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This song, which is found with scarcely any material variation as <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/18.htm">Psalm 18</a>, and with the words of this first verse for its title, belongs to the early part of David's reign when he was recently established upon the throne of all Israel, and when his final triumph over the house of Saul, and over the pagan nations <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-44.htm">2 Samuel 22:44-46</a>, Philistines, Moabites, Syrians, Ammonites, and Edomites, was still fresh <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/21.htm">2 Samuel 21</a>. For a commentary on the separate verses the reader is referred to the commentary on <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/18.htm">Psalm 18</a>. <p>The last words of David - i. e., his last Psalm, his last "words of song" <a href="/2_samuel/22-1.htm">2 Samuel 22:1</a>.

The description of David is divided into four clauses, which correspond to and balance each other. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 22<p>2Sa 22:1-51. David's Psalm of Thanksgiving for God's Powerful Deliverance and Manifold Blessings.<p>The song contained in this chapter is the same as the eighteenth Psalm, where the full commentary will be given [see on [278]Ps 18:1, &c.]. It may be sufficient simply to remark that Jewish writers have noticed a great number of very minute variations in the language of the song as recorded here, from that embodied in the Book of Psalms&#8212;which may be accounted for by the fact that this, the first copy of the poem, was carefully revised and altered by David afterwards, when it was set to the music of the tabernacle. This inspired ode was manifestly the effusion of a mind glowing with the highest fervor of piety and gratitude, and it is full of the noblest imagery that is to be found within the range even of sacred poetry. It is David's grand tribute of thanksgiving for deliverance from his numerous and powerful enemies, and establishing him in the power and glory of the kingdom.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/22.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/22.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>The Lord rewarded me according to my righteousness: according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.

David does not lay claim to a perfect righteousness, but to sincerity and single-heartedness in his devotion to God. Compare his own testimony (<a href="/1_samuel/26-23.htm" title="The LORD render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness; for the LORD delivered you into my hand to day, but I would not stretch forth my hand against the LORD's anointed.">1 Samuel 26:23</a>), God’s testimony (<a href="/1_kings/14-8.htm" title="And rent the kingdom away from the house of David, and gave it you: and yet you have not been as my servant David, who kept my commandments, and who followed me with all his heart, to do that only which was right in my eyes;">1 Kings 14:8</a>), and the testimony of history (<a href="/1_kings/11-4.htm" title="For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned away his heart after other gods: and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God, as was the heart of David his father.">1 Kings 11:4</a>; <a href="/1_kings/15-5.htm" title="Because David did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD, and turned not aside from any thing that he commanded him all the days of his life, save only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite.">1 Kings 15:5</a>), to his essential integrity.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Is not this conscious rectitude, this “princely heart of innocence,” a clear indication that the Psalm was written before his great fall?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the cleanness of my hands</span>] = the purity of my actions.

For while be acknowledges in them a tendency to sin, he affirms that he had been on his guard against it, and that he had ever kept God's statutes present before his view. However complete may be the penitent's recovery, yet can he never again be "perfect," the word applied to an animal without blemish, and therefore fit for sacrifice. The crime remains a blemish, even though the intense sorrow for the sin may make it the means of even attaining to a higher stage of spirituality and devotion. In ver. 22 the words literally are, "I have not sinned away from God," sin necessarily removing the sinner away from that nearness to God which is the privilege of the saint. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/22.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>14  Jehovah thundered from the heavens,<p>And the Most High gave His voice.<p>15  He sent arrows, and scattered them;<p>Lightning, and discomfited them.<p>16  Then the beds of the sea became visible;<p>The foundations of the world were uncovered,<p>Through the threatening of Jehovah,<p>By the snorting of the breath of His nostrils.<p>God sent lightning as arrows upon the enemies along with violent thunder, and threw them thereby into confusion. &#1492;&#1502;&#1501;, to throw into confusion, and thereby to destroy, is the standing expression for the destruction of the foe accomplished by the miraculous interposition of God (vid., <a href="/exodus/14-24.htm">Exodus 14:24</a>; <a href="/exodus/23-27.htm">Exodus 23:27</a>; <a href="/joshua/10-10.htm">Joshua 10:10</a>; <a href="/judges/4-15.htm">Judges 4:15</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/7-10.htm">1 Samuel 7:10</a>). To the thunder there were added stormy wind and earthquake, as an effect of the wrath of God, whereby the foundations of the sea and land were laid bare, i.e., whereby the depth of the abyss and of the hell in the interior of the earth, into which the person to be rescued had fallen, were disclosed.<p>(Note: In <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-13.htm">2 Samuel 22:13-16</a> the text of the Psalms deviates greatly and in many instances from that before us. In v. 13 we find &#1488;&#1513;&#1473; &#1493;&#1490;&#1495;&#1500;&#1497; &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1491; &#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; &#1506;&#1489;&#1497;&#1493; instead of &#1488;&#1513;&#1473; &#1490;&#1468;&#1495;&#1500;&#1497; &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;; and after v. 14 &#1488;&#1513;&#1473; &#1493;&#1490;&#1495;&#1500;&#1497; &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1491; is repeated in the psalm. In v. 15 we have &#1512;&#1489; &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501; for &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1511;, and in v. 16 &#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1508;&#1497;&#1511;&#1497; for &#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1508;&#1497;&#1511;&#1497;. The other deviations are inconsiderable. So far as the repetition of &#1488;&#1513;&#1473; &#1493;&#1490;&#1495;&#1500;&#1497; &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1491; at the end of v. 14 is concerned, it is not only superfluous, but unsuitable, because the lightning following the thunder is described in v. 15, and the words repeated are probably nothing more than a gloss that has crept by an oversight into the text. The &#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1508;&#1497;&#1511;&#1497; in v. 16 is an obvious softening down of the &#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1508;&#1497;&#1511;&#1497; of the text before us. In the other deviations, however, the text of the Psalms is evidently the more original of the two; the abridgment of the second clause of v. 13 is evidently a simplification of the figurative description in the psalm, and &#1512;&#1489; &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501; in the 15th verse of the psalm is more poetical and a stronger expression than the mere &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1511; of our text.) </body></html>
