They that trust God in the way of duty, shall find him a present help in their greatest dangers: David did so. Remarkable preservations should be particularly mentioned in our praises. We shall never be delivered from all enemies till we get to heaven. God will preserve all his people, 2Ti 4:18. Those who receive signal mercies from God, ought to give him the glory. In the day that God delivered David, he sang this song. While the mercy is fresh, and we are most affected with it, let the thank-offering be brought, to be kindled with the fire of that affection. All his joys and hopes close, as all our hopes should do, in the great Redeemer.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This song, which is found with scarcely any material variation as <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/18.htm">Psalm 18</a>, and with the words of this first verse for its title, belongs to the early part of David's reign when he was recently established upon the throne of all Israel, and when his final triumph over the house of Saul, and over the pagan nations <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-44.htm">2 Samuel 22:44-46</a>, Philistines, Moabites, Syrians, Ammonites, and Edomites, was still fresh <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/21.htm">2 Samuel 21</a>. For a commentary on the separate verses the reader is referred to the commentary on <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/18.htm">Psalm 18</a>. <p>The last words of David - i. e., his last Psalm, his last "words of song" <a href="/2_samuel/22-1.htm">2 Samuel 22:1</a>. The insertion of this Psalm, which is not in the Book of Psalms, was probably suggested by the insertion of the long Psalm in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/22.htm">2 Samuel 22</a>.<p>David the son of Jesse said ... - The original word for "said" is used between 200 and 300 times in the phrase, "saith the Lord," designating the word of God in the mouth of the prophet. It is only applied to the words of a man here, and in the strikingly similar passage <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/24-3.htm">Numbers 24:3-4</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/24-15.htm">Numbers 24:15-16</a>, and in <a href="/proverbs/30-1.htm">Proverbs 30:1</a>; and in all these places the words spoken are inspired words. The description of David is divided into four clauses, which correspond to and balance each other. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 22<p>2Sa 22:1-51. David's Psalm of Thanksgiving for God's Powerful Deliverance and Manifold Blessings.<p>The song contained in this chapter is the same as the eighteenth Psalm, where the full commentary will be given [see on [278]Ps 18:1, &c.]. It may be sufficient simply to remark that Jewish writers have noticed a great number of very minute variations in the language of the song as recorded here, from that embodied in the Book of Psalms&#8212;which may be accounted for by the fact that this, the first copy of the poem, was carefully revised and altered by David afterwards, when it was set to the music of the tabernacle. This inspired ode was manifestly the effusion of a mind glowing with the highest fervor of piety and gratitude, and it is full of the noblest imagery that is to be found within the range even of sacred poetry. It is David's grand tribute of thanksgiving for deliverance from his numerous and powerful enemies, and establishing him in the power and glory of the kingdom.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/22.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/22.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>He sent from above, he took me; he drew me out of many waters.

The cherub is not a personified earthly creature, for cherubim are angels around the throne of God (see at <a href="/genesis/3-22.htm">Genesis 3:22</a>). The poetical figure "riding upon the cherub" is borrowed from the fact that God was enthroned between the two cherubim upon the lid of the ark of the covenant, and above their outspread wings (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/25-20.htm">Exodus 25:20-21</a>). As the idea of His "dwelling between the cherubim" (<a href="/2_samuel/6-2.htm">2 Samuel 6:2</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/4-4.htm">1 Samuel 4:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/80-2.htm">Psalm 80:2</a>) was founded upon this typical manifestation of the gracious presence of God in the Most Holy place, so here David depicts the descent of Jehovah from heaven as "riding upon a cherub," picturing the cherub as a throne upon which God appears in the clouds of heaven, though without therefore imagining Him as riding upon a sphinx or driving in a chariot-throne. Such notions as these are precluded by the addition of the term &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1507;, "did fly." The "flying" is also suggested by the wings of the cherubim. As the divine "shechinah" was enthroned above the ark of the covenant upon the wings of the cherubim, David in his poetical description represents the cherub and his wings as carrying the throne of God, to express the thought that Jehovah came down from heaven as the judge and saviour of His servants in the splendour of His divine glory, surrounded by cherubim who stand as His highest servants around His throne, just as Moses in his blessing (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-2.htm">Deuteronomy 33:2</a>) speaks of Jehovah as coming out of myriads of His holy angels. The elementary substratum of this was the wings of the wind, upon which He appeared. In the psalm we have &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1491;&#1488;, from &#1491;&#1468;&#1488;&#1492;, to soar (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-39.htm">Deuteronomy 28:39</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/48-40.htm">Jeremiah 48:40</a>), which suggests the idea of flying better than &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488; (He was seen), though the latter gives the real explanation. In <a href="/2_samuel/22-12.htm">2 Samuel 22:12</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-13.htm">2 Samuel 22:13</a>, the "cloudy darkness under His feet" (<a href="/2_samuel/22-10.htm">2 Samuel 22:10</a>) is still further expanded, so as to prepare the way for the description of thunder and lightning in <a href="/2_samuel/22-14.htm">2 Samuel 22:14</a>. God in His wrath withdraws His face from man. He envelopes himself in clouds. The darkness round about him is the black thunder-cloud which forms His hut or tent. The plural succoth is occasioned by the plural &#1505;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493;, "His surroundings:" it is used with indefinite generality, and is more probably the original term than &#1505;&#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493; in the psalm. The "darkness" is still further explained in the second clause, &#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1514;, water-gatherings. &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1492; (&#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;.) signifies, according to the Arabic, a gathering or collection. The expression used in the psalm is &#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1514;, water-darkness, which, if not less appropriate, is at any rate not the original term. &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501; &#1506;&#1489;&#1497;, clouds of clouds, i.e., the thickest clouds; a kind of superlative, in which a synonym is used instead of the same noun. </body></html>
