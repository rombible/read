They that trust God in the way of duty, shall find him a present help in their greatest dangers: David did so. Remarkable preservations should be particularly mentioned in our praises. We shall never be delivered from all enemies till we get to heaven. God will preserve all his people, 2Ti 4:18. Those who receive signal mercies from God, ought to give him the glory. In the day that God delivered David, he sang this song. While the mercy is fresh, and we are most affected with it, let the thank-offering be brought, to be kindled with the fire of that affection. All his joys and hopes close, as all our hopes should do, in the great Redeemer.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This song, which is found with scarcely any material variation as <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/18.htm">Psalm 18</a>, and with the words of this first verse for its title, belongs to the early part of David's reign when he was recently established upon the throne of all Israel, and when his final triumph over the house of Saul, and over the pagan nations <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-44.htm">2 Samuel 22:44-46</a>, Philistines, Moabites, Syrians, Ammonites, and Edomites, was still fresh <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/21.htm">2 Samuel 21</a>. For a commentary on the separate verses the reader is referred to the commentary on <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/18.htm">Psalm 18</a>. <p>The last words of David - i. e., his last Psalm, his last "words of song" <a href="/2_samuel/22-1.htm">2 Samuel 22:1</a>. The insertion of this Psalm, which is not in the Book of Psalms, was probably suggested by the insertion of the long Psalm in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/22.htm">2 Samuel 22</a>.<p>David the son of Jesse said ... - The original word for "said" is used between 200 and 300 times in the phrase, "saith the Lord," designating the word of God in the mouth of the prophet. It is only applied to the words of a man here, and in the strikingly similar passage <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/24-3.htm">Numbers 24:3-4</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/24-15.htm">Numbers 24:15-16</a>, and in <a href="/proverbs/30-1.htm">Proverbs 30:1</a>; and in all these places the words spoken are inspired words. The description of David is divided into four clauses, which correspond to and balance each other. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 22<p>2Sa 22:1-51. David's Psalm of Thanksgiving for God's Powerful Deliverance and Manifold Blessings.<p>The song contained in this chapter is the same as the eighteenth Psalm, where the full commentary will be given [see on [278]Ps 18:1, &c.]. It may be sufficient simply to remark that Jewish writers have noticed a great number of very minute variations in the language of the song as recorded here, from that embodied in the Book of Psalms&#8212;which may be accounted for by the fact that this, the first copy of the poem, was carefully revised and altered by David afterwards, when it was set to the music of the tabernacle. This inspired ode was manifestly the effusion of a mind glowing with the highest fervor of piety and gratitude, and it is full of the noblest imagery that is to be found within the range even of sacred poetry. It is David's grand tribute of thanksgiving for deliverance from his numerous and powerful enemies, and establishing him in the power and glory of the kingdom.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/22.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/22.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them; and turned not again until I had consumed them.

This exultation of David at the result of his wars is in accordance with the harsh treatment inflicted by him upon the vanquished. His enemies were God's enemies, whom he must consume. The "new commandment" of Christianity forbids and condemns this delight in conquest. Vers. 41-43. - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"And mine enemies thou hast made to turn upon me their back,<br />Even those that hate me; and have utterly destroyed them.<br />They looked, but there was none to save,<br />Even to Jehovah, but he answered them not.<br />And I beat them small as the dust of the earth;<br />As the mire of the streets I stamped upon them, I trode them down."</span> <span class="cmt_word">Those that hate me.</span> The sentence is to be completed from the previous clause, "my  haters" and "my enemies" being equivalent. There are several small variations between the text here and in <a href="/psalms/18.htm">Psalm 18</a>, such as "they cried" for they looked; and "I emptied them out" for I stamped upon them, the difference in both cases consisting in a single letter. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/22.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>32  For who is God save Jehovah,<p>And who a rock save our God?<p>33  This God is my strong fortress,<p>And leads the innocent his way.<p>34  He makes my feet like the hinds,<p>And setteth me upon my high places;<p>35  He teacheth my hands to fight,<p>And my arms span brazen bows.<p>There is no true God who can help, except or by the side of Jehovah (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/32-31.htm">Deuteronomy 32:31</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/2-2.htm">1 Samuel 2:2</a>). &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, as in <a href="/2_samuel/22-2.htm">2 Samuel 22:2</a>. This God is "my strong fortress:" for this figure, comp. <a href="/psalms/31-5.htm">Psalm 31:5</a> and <a href="/psalms/27-1.htm">Psalm 27:1</a>. &#1495;&#1497;&#1500;, strength, might, is construed with &#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494;&#1497;, by free subordination: "my fortress, a strong one," like &#1506;&#1494; &#1502;&#1495;&#1505;&#1497; (<a href="/psalms/71-7.htm">Psalm 71:7</a>; cf. Ewald, 291, b.). &#1497;&#1514;&#1468;&#1512; for &#1497;&#1514;&#1512;, from &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; (vid., Ges. 72; Olshausen, Gram. p. 579), in the sense of leading or taking round, as in <a href="/proverbs/12-26.htm">Proverbs 12:26</a>. God leads the innocent his way, i.e., He is his leader and guide therein. The Keri &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497; rests upon a misunderstanding. There is an important difference in the reading of this verse in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/18.htm">Psalm 18</a>, viz., "The God who girdeth me with strength, and makes my way innocent." The last clause is certainly an alteration which simplifies the meaning, and so is also the first clause, the thought of which occurs again, word for word, in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-40.htm">2 Samuel 22:40</a>, with the addition of &#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1495;&#1502;&#1492;. &#1488;&#1497;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492; or &#1488;&#1497;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;, the hind, or female stag, is a figure of speech denoting swiftness in running. "Like the hinds:" a condensed simile for "like the hinds' feet," such as we frequently meet with in Hebrew (vid., Ges. 144, Anm.). The reference is to swiftness in pursuit of the foe (vid., <a href="/2_samuel/2-18.htm">2 Samuel 2:18</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/12-8.htm">1 Chronicles 12:8</a>). &#1512;&#1490;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;, his feet, for &#1512;&#1490;&#1500;&#1497; (my feet) in the psalm, may be accounted for from the fact, that David had spoken of himself in the third person as the innocent one. "My high places" were not the high places of the enemy, that became his by virtue of conquest, but the high places of his own land, which he maintained triumphantly, so that he ruled the land for them. The expression is formed after <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-13.htm">Deuteronomy 32:13</a>, and is imitated in <a href="/habakkuk/3-19.htm">Habakkuk 3:19</a>. &#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1491; is generally construed with a double accusative: here it is written with an accusative and &#1500;, and signifies to instruct for the war. &#1504;&#1495;&#1514;, in the psalm &#1504;&#1495;&#1514;&#1492;, on account of the feminine &#1494;&#1512;&#1493;&#1506;&#1514;&#1497;, is not the Niphal of &#1495;&#1514;&#1514;, to be broken in pieces, but the Piel of &#1504;&#1495;&#1514;, to cause to go down, to press down the bow, i.e., to set it. The bow of brass is mentioned as being the strongest: setting such a bow would be a sign of great heroic strength. The two verses (<a href="/2_samuel/22-34.htm">2 Samuel 22:34</a> and <a href="/2_samuel/22-35.htm">2 Samuel 22:35</a>) are simply a particularizing description of the power and might with which the Lord had endowed David to enable him to conquer all his foes. </body></html>
