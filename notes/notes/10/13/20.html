Thus David might trace the sins of his children to his own misconduct, which must have made the anguish of the chastisement worse.

Either meeting her in the street, or rather when come to his house: <p>hath Amnon thy brother been with thee? been rude with thee, and lain with thee, which is the meaning of this modest expression; which he guessed at, having heard of her being sent to his house, and knowing his lustful disposition, and seeing her in such a forlorn condition: he calls him Aminon, for so it is in the Hebrew text, and not Amnon, by way of contempt, as Kimchi observes: <p>but hold now thy peace, my sister; be silent, take no notice of this matter, say nothing of it to the king, nor any other, keep it in thine own breast, and make thyself easy: <p>he is thy brother, regard not this thing; it is thy brother that has done it, and not so disgraceful as a meaner person, done in the heat of lust, and a youthful one, and should be forgiven; besides, to divulge it would bring disgrace upon the whole family, and no recompence would be obtained by telling the king of it, since he was his son, his firstborn, and heir to the crown; this he said not out of love of Amnon, but as desirous of gratifying private revenge upon him for it when opportunity should serve. <p>So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom's house; not seeing any company, being filled with grief and shame, and none applying to her as a suitor, knowing she was vitiated; how long she continued here, or lived after this, is not certain; no mention is made of her afterwards. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_samuel/13.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And Absalom her brother said unto her, Hath Amnon thy brother been with thee? but <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> hold now thy peace, my sister: he <i>is</i> thy brother; regard not this thing.

To him, according to Oriental custom, belonged the duty of avenging his sister’s wrongs.

He was, in fact, so indignant at her treatment as to have purposed the sternest vengeance. But this he concealed from her, and counselled patience, net merely because she would have dissuaded him from a course so full of danger to himself, but because it was the duty of both to wait and see what course David would take. Where polygamy is permitted, it is the duty especially of the brothers to defend their sisters' honour (<a href="/genesis/34-31.htm">Genesis 34:31</a>). But David was both her father and the chief magistrate; and, moreover, he had been made an instrument in his daughter's wrong. They must be patient, and only if David failed in his duty would Absalom's turn come. Meanwhile, Tamar dwelt in his house desolate, as one whose honour and happiness had been laid waste. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/13.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Amnon would not listen to her, however, but overpowered her, forced her, and lay with her.</body></html>
