This is the third time it is mentioned, and the reason of it here Abarbinel thinks is, that when he first fled to his grandfather, he used to stand openly in the court of his palace, and go with him wherever he went from place to place; but when he understood that his father mourned so for the death of Amnon, he was afraid he would send some person to lay hold on him, and take vengeance on him; and therefore he would go no more with the king from place to place, but went and abode in Geshur always, which was a fortified city, as it follows: <p>and went to Geshur, and was there three years: and never went out of it, until he was fetched by Joab, as <a href="/2_samuel/14-23.htm">2 Samuel 14:23</a> relates; nor is there anything in <a href="/2_samuel/13-37.htm">2 Samuel 13:37</a> disturbed and mutilated, as Spinosa (r) intimates, but the whole is very expressive and emphatic. <p>(r) Tractat.

At each step of the narrative only the fact is brought out which is wanted, (1) the flight; (2) the place whither he fled; (3) the duration of the absence; but with each new fact the old ones on which it depends are repeated.” <span class="ital">Speaker’s Comm</span>.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/13.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Then Jonadab, the same person who had helped Amnon to commit his crime, said, "Let not my lord say (or think) that they have slain all the young men the king's sons, but Amnon alone is dead; for it was laid upon the mouth of Absalom from the day that he forced his sister Tamar." The meaning is either "they might see it (the murder of Amnon) by his mouth," or "they might gather it from what he said." &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1502;&#1492; &#1492;&#1497;&#1514;&#1492;: it was a thing laid down, i.e., determined (vid., <a href="/exodus/21-13.htm">Exodus 21:13</a>). The subject, viz., the thing itself, or the intended murder of Amnon, may easily be supplied from the context. &#1488;&#1501; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; is undoubtedly used in the sense of "no but." The negation is implied in the thought: Let the king not lay it to heart, that they say all the king's sons are dead; it is not so, but only Amnon is dead. Jonadab does not seem to speak from mere conjecture; he is much too sure of what he says. He might possibly have heard expressions from Absalom's lips which made him certain as to how the matter stood.</body></html>
