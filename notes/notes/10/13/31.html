But “what unparalleled impudence and effrontery,” says Delaney, “was this, to speak with such calmness and unconcern of a horrid villany, which he himself had contrived, and of which he now saw the dreadful consequences! What a miscreant minister was this, and how much fitter to be admitted into the councils of hell than into those of David! <span class="ital">This hath been determined from the day that he forced his sister — </span>And did Jonadab know all this? or had he any cause to suspect it? Then what a wicked wretch was he, that he did not make David acquainted with it sooner, in order that means might have been used to make up the quarrel, or, at least, that David might not have thrown Amnon into the mouth of danger, by letting him go to Absalom’s house. For, if we do not do our utmost to prevent mischief, we make ourselves accessory to it. It is well if Jonadab was not as guilty of Amnon’s death as he was of his sin. Such friends do they prove who are hearkened to when they counsel us to do wickedly.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/13.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>13:30-39 Jonadab was as guilty of Ammon's death, as of his sin; such false friends do they prove, who counsel us to do wickedly. Instead of loathing Absalom as a murderer, David, after a time, longed to go forth to him. This was David's infirmity: God saw something in his heart that made a difference, else we should have thought that he, as much as Eli, honoured his sons more than God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Upon his mule - So in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/1-33.htm">1 Kings 1:33</a>, <a href="/1_kings/1-38.htm">1 Kings 1:38</a> the mule is the royal animal on which David himself rides.
