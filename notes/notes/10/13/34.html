When the king’s sons fled to the palace, Absalom, taking advantage of the confusion, escaped another way. The reason for mentioning the fact just here is that otherwise he would seem to be included among “the king’s sons” of the two following verses.<p><span class= "bld">Behind him</span>—<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>from the west, the Oriental always being supposed to face the east in speaking of the points of the compass.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/2_samuel/13.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/2_samuel/13-34.htm" title="But Absalom fled.

No part of the land of Israel could shelter him; the cities of refuge afforded no protection to a wilful murderer. Though David had let Amnon’s incest go unpunished, Absalom could not promise himself his pardon for this murder. He therefore made the best of his way to his mother’s relations, and was entertained and protected by his grandfather Talmai three years; David not demanding him, and Talmai not thinking himself obliged to send him back unless he were demanded.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/13.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>13:30-39 Jonadab was as guilty of Ammon's death, as of his sin; such false friends do they prove, who counsel us to do wickedly. Instead of loathing Absalom as a murderer, David, after a time, longed to go forth to him. This was David's infirmity: God saw something in his heart that made a difference, else we should have thought that he, as much as Eli, honoured his sons more than God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Absalom fled - This is the sequel to <a href="/2_samuel/13-29.htm">2 Samuel 13:29</a>.

This information is inserted here to account for the king's sons returning unmolested. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>30, 31. tidings came to David, saying, Absalom hath slain all the king's sons&#8212;It was natural that in the consternation and tumult caused by so atrocious a deed, an exaggerated report should reach the court, which was at once plunged into the depths of grief and despair. But the information of Jonadab, who seems to have been aware of the plan, and the arrival of the other princes, made known the real extent of the catastrophe.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Absalom fled; </span> he who had undertaken to defend his servants flees or his own life. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Behind him; </span> behind the watchman; for it seems they did not come in the direct road, where the watchman looked for them, but (for some reason or fancy they had) fetched a compass, and came that way which he least expected them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/13.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But Absalom fled,.... He who promised his servants protection could not protect himself, and who no doubt fled with him; he knew what he had done was death by law, and that there was no city of refuge for such sort of murder as this, and he had no reason to hope the king would suffer so foul a crime as this to pass unpunished: <p>and the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked: to the way that led from Absalom's house to Jerusalem, to see if he could spy any other messenger on the road from thence: <p>and, behold, there came much people by the way of the hill side behind him; that is, behind the watchman, who, looking round him, saw them; these people were the king's sons and their attendants, who, being at some distance, the young man could not discern who they were; they did not come the direct road from Absalom's house, but came a round about way, for fear, as R. Isaiah rightly conjectures, lest Absalom should pursue, or send pursuers after them, and slay them; though others, as Kimchi, think this refers to the hill, and that the sense is, that the watchman saw them coming from the way which was behind the hill, and began to see them when they came to the side of it, which was the way that led to the city, surrounded by mountains, see <a href="/psalms/125-2.htm">Psalm 125:2</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_samuel/13.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But Absalom fled.

Cp. ch. <a href="/2_samuel/18-24.htm" title="And David sat between the two gates: and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate to the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold a man running alone.">2 Samuel 18:24</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">much people</span>] The princes had been attended by a numerous retinue of followers.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">by the way of the hill side behind him</span>] <span class="bld">From the way behind him from the side of the hill</span>: that is probably, if the text is sound, <span class="ital">from the west</span>. But the Sept. has important variations, thus: “And behold much people were coming in the way behind him by the side of the hill at the descent. And the watchman came and told the king, and said, I have seen men coming from the way of Oronen, by the side of the hill. And Jonadab said,” &c. <span class="ital">Oronen</span> may represent <span class="ital">Horonaim</span> or Beth-horon, the dual form referring to the two places of that name, the “Upper” and “Lower” Beth-horon—which lay north-west of Jerusalem.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But Absalom fled.</span> These words break the form of the narrative, but complete the sense. They briefly state that Jonadab was right; for, so far from molesting any of the rest of the king's sons, Absalom had no other thought than for his own safety. He had avenged his sister, but had at present no other sinister design. It was David's method of treating him which drove this youth, with a nature fit for treachery, into schemes of rebellion. <span class="cmt_word">The way of the hillside behind him.</span> This may mean "from the west," as, in taking the points of the compass, the Hebrews looked to the east, which would thus be "before them." Compare "the backside of the desert," that is, "the western side," in <a href="/exodus/3-1.htm">Exodus 3:1</a>; and "the Syrians before and the Philistines behind," that is, on the east and west (<a href="/isaiah/9-12.htm">Isaiah 9:12</a>).
