Though Tamar's wrong was the mainspring of Absalom's conduct, yet neither he nor his men would forget that Amnon stood between him and the crown; and Amnon, entirely off his guard, never very wise at his best, and with his senses made dull by wine, seems to have fallen an easy prey. And as soon as the murder was committed, the rest of the king's sons, though all had attendants with them, fled in dismay, not knowing what might be the extent of Absalom's purpose. It is said that they fled on mules, this being the first place in which this animal is mentioned, as the word so translated in <a href="/genesis/36-24.htm">Genesis 36:24</a> really means "hot springs," and is so translated in the Revised Version. The breeding of hybrids was forbidden in <a href="/leviticus/19-19.htm">Leviticus 19:19</a>, and probably they were procured, as were horses, by trade. Up to this time the ass had been used for riding; but now David had a favourite mule (<a href="/1_kings/1-33.htm">1 Kings 1:33</a>), and Solomon received mules as tribute (<a href="/1_kings/10-25.htm">1 Kings 10:25</a>). Horses seem to have been used chiefly for chariots. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/13.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When David heard "all these things," he became very wrathful; but Absalom did not speak to Amnon "from good to evil" (i.e., either good or evil, not a single word: <a href="/genesis/24-50.htm">Genesis 24:50</a>), because he hated him for having humbled his sister. The lxx add to the words "he (David) was very wroth," the following clause: "He did not trouble the spirit of Amnon his son, because he loved him, for he was his first-born." This probably gives the true reason why David let such a crime as Amnon's go unpunished, when the law enjoined that incest should be punished with death (<a href="/leviticus/20-17.htm">Leviticus 20:17</a>); at the same time it is nothing but a subjective conjecture of the translators, and does not warrant us in altering the text. The fact that David was contented to be simply angry is probably to be accounted for partly from his own consciousness of guilt, since he himself had been guilty of adultery; but it arose chiefly from his indulgent affection towards his sons, and his consequent want of discipline. This weakness in his character bore very bitter fruit. </body></html>
