Adultery and murder were David's sins, the like sins among his children were the beginnings of his punishment: he was too indulgent to his children. Thus David might trace the sins of his children to his own misconduct, which must have made the anguish of the chastisement worse. Let no one ever expect good treatment from those who are capable of attempting their seduction; but it is better to suffer the greatest wrong than to commit the least sin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The dish into which she poured the &#1500;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489;&#1492;  la&#772;b&#305;&#770;yba&#770;h was doubtless borne to him by one of the servants into the chamber where he lay, and from which, the doors being open, he could see the outer room where Tamar prepared the meat. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2Sa 13:6-27.

The cakes seem to have been a kind of fancy bread, in the preparation of which Oriental ladies take great delight.

A man may be a good French scholar, and yet find it difficult in France to ask for things in common use. Here the Syriac is probably right in understanding, not a pan, but the delicacy Tamar had been cooking. In ver. 8 the word rendered "flour" is certainly "dough," and is so rendered in the Revised Version. The cakes were a kind of pancake, fitted to tempt the appetite of a sickly person. The picture is a very interesting one: the palace parcelled out into separate dwellings; the king kindly visiting all; the girls on friendly terms with their brothers, yet not allowed to go to their rooms without special permission; and finally Tamar's skill in cookery - an accomplishment by no means despised in an Oriental <span class="accented">menage</span>, or thought unworthy of a king's daughter. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/13.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Amnon's miserable appearance was observed by his cousin Jonadab, a very crafty man, who asked him what was the reason, and then gave him advice as to the way in which he might succeed in gratifying his desires.
