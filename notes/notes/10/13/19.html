Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of divers colours &#8230; laid her hand on her head, and went on crying&#8212;that is, sobbing. Oriental manners would probably see nothing beyond a strong sense of the injury she had sustained, if Tamar actually rent her garments. But, as her veil is not mentioned, it is probable that Amnon had turned her out of doors without it, and she raised her hand with the design to conceal her face. By these signs, especially the rending of her distinguishing robe, Absalom at once conjectured what had taken place. Recommending her to be silent about it and not publish her own and her family's dishonor, he gave no inkling of his angry feelings to Amnon. But all the while he was in secret "nursing his wrath to keep it warm," and only "biding his time" to avenge his sister's wrongs, and by the removal of the heir-apparent perhaps further also his ambitious designs.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Put ashes on her head, and rent her garment; </span> to signify her grief for some calamity which had befallen her, and what that was concurring circumstances did easily discover. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Laid her hand on her head, </span> in token of grief and shame, as if she were unable and ashamed to show her face.

If David had foreseen this sad sight when giving way to his passion for Bathsheba, he would have felt that sin is indeed "folly," and that its pleasure is followed by shame and bitter anguish. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/13.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Tamar attempted to escape by pointing to the wickedness of such a desire: "Pray, do not, my brother, do not humble me; for they do not such things in Israel: do not this folly." The words recall <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/34-7.htm">Genesis 34:7</a>, where the expression "folly" (nebalah) is first used to denote a want of chastity. Such a sin was altogether out of keeping with the calling and holiness of Israel (vid., <a href="/leviticus/20-8.htm">Leviticus 20:8</a>.). "And I, whither should I carry my shame?" i.e., shame and contempt would meet me everywhere. "And thou wouldst be as one of the fools in Israel." We should both of us reap nothing but shame from it. What Tamar still further said, "Now therefore, I pray thee, speak to the king, for he will not refuse me to thee," is no doubt at variance with the law which prohibits marriage between step-brothers and sisters (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/18-9.htm">Leviticus 18:9</a>, <a href="/leviticus/18-11.htm">Leviticus 18:11</a>; <a href="/leviticus/20-17.htm">Leviticus 20:17</a>); but it by no means proves that the laws of Leviticus were not in existence at the time, nor does it even presuppose that Tamar was ignorant of any such law. She simply said this, as Clericus observes, "that she might escape from his hands by any means in her power, and to avoid inflaming him still more and driving him to sin by precluding all hope of marriage."<p>(Note: Josephus adopts this explanation: "This she said, as desirous to avoid her brother's violent passion at present" (Ant. viii. 8, 1).)<p>We cannot therefore even infer from these words of hers, that she really thought the king could grant a dispensation from the existing hindrances to their marriage.</body></html>
