He neither debated it with him, nor threatened him for it, but seemed willing to pass it by with brotherly kindness. Not that he forbore all discourse with him on any subject, which would have raised jealousy in his mind, and also in David’s.

He engaged his servants in the guilt. Those servants are ill-taught who obey wicked masters, against God's commands.

This want of justice in David's conduct, and favoritism to Amnon, probably rankled in Absalom's heart, and was the first seed of his after rebellion. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20.

He neither debated it with him, nor threatened him for it; but seemed willing to cover it, and pass it by with brotherly kindness.

That is, said nothing at all to him about the rape of his sister; not that he was sulky with him, and would not converse with him at all; for then Amnon would have mistrusted that he was meditating revenge, and therefore would have been upon his guard; but on the contrary he talked freely, and in appearance friendly, on other things, the better to conceal his hatred of him, and his design to avenge the injury of his sister: <p>for Absalom hated Amnon; or, "though" (f) he hated him, yet he behaved in this manner towards him: <p>because he had forced his sister Tamar: who was so by father and mother's side, and so near and dear unto him, and therefore resented the injury done her. <p>(f)  "quamvis", Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator, Pool, &amp; Patrick. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_samuel/13.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And Absalom spake unto his brother Amnon neither good nor bad: for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/2_samuel/13.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">22</span>. <span class="ital">neither good nor bad</span>] He made no allusion whatever to the matter, in order to quiet Amnon’s suspicions.

Absalom's outward demeanour was one of utter indifference, concealing a cruel determination.

Tamar calls his sending her away a greater evil than the one already done to her, because it would inevitably be supposed that she had been guilty of some shameful conduct herself, that the seduction had come from her; whereas she was perfectly innocent, and had done nothing but what affection towards a sick brother dictated, whilst it was impossible for her to call for help (as prescribed in <a href="/deuteronomy/22-27.htm">Deuteronomy 22:27</a>), because Amnon had sent the servants away, and Tamar could not in any case expect assistance from them.</body></html>
