She first speaks of the sinfulness in Israel of that which was allowed among surrounding heathen, quoting the very words of <a href="/genesis/34-7.htm" title="And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard it: and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had worked folly in Israel in lying with Jacob's daughter: which thing ought not to be done.">Genesis 34:7</a>, as if by the traditions of their nation to recall the king’s son to a sense of right. She then sets forth the personal consequences to themselves; if he had any love for her he could not wish that shame and contempt should meet her everywhere; and for himself, such an act would make him “as one of the fools in Israel,” as one who had cast off the fear of God and the restraints of decency.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/2_samuel/13.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/2_samuel/13-12.htm" title="And she answered him, No, my brother, do not force me; for no such thing ought to be done in Israel: do not you this folly.">2 Samuel 13:12</a></span>. <span class="ital">Nay, my brother — </span>Whom nature both teaches to abhor such thoughts, and obliges to defend me from such an injury, with thy utmost hazard, if another should attempt it. <span class="ital">Do not force me — </span>Thou oughtest to abhor it, if I were willing; but to add violence is abominable. <span class="ital">No such thing ought to be done in Israel — </span>Among God’s people, who are taught better things; who also will be infinitely reproached for so base an action.

Adultery and murder were David's sins, the like sins among his children were the beginnings of his punishment: he was too indulgent to his children. Thus David might trace the sins of his children to his own misconduct, which must have made the anguish of the chastisement worse. Let no one ever expect good treatment from those who are capable of attempting their seduction; but it is better to suffer the greatest wrong than to commit the least sin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Tamar's words are a verbal quotation from <a href="/genesis/34-7.htm">Genesis 34:7</a>.

In bidding him, however, "speak to the king, for he will not withhold me from thee," it is probable that she urged this as her last resource, saying anything she thought would please him, in order to escape for the present out of his hands.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Nay, my brother, </span> whom nature both teacheth to abhor such thoughts, and obligeth to defend me from such a mischief with thy utmost hazard if another should attempt it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Do not force me:</span> thou shouldst abhor it, if I were willing; but to add violence to thy filthiness is abominable. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In Israel; </span> among God’s people, who are taught better things; who also will be infinitely reproached for such a base action. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/13.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And she answered him, nay, my brother,....

Such acts might be common among heathen nations, but to Israel they were forbidden by the Law, which placed them on a loftier level of morality.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Do not force me;</span> literally, <span class="accented">do not humble me.</span> It is to be regretted that the word should be changed, as it bears testimony to the nobleness of the Hebrew women, who regarded their chastity as their crown of honour. The word folly is used in the sense of unchastity in <a href="/genesis/34-7.htm">Genesis 34:7</a> and elsewhere, and it is noteworthy that the Jews thus connected crime with stupidity. Vain, that is, empty persons were the criminal part of the population (<a href="/judges/9-4.htm">Judges 9:4</a>), and to call a man "a fool" was to attribute to him every possible kind of wickedness (<a href="/matthew/5-22.htm">Matthew 5:22</a>). The thought which lay at the root of this view of sin was that Israel was a peculiar people, sanctified to God's service; and all unholiness, therefore, was not merely criminal in itself, but a proof that the guilty person was incapable of rightly estimating his privileges. Tamar urges this upon her "empty" brother, and then pathetically dwells upon their mutual shame, and, finding all in vain, she even suggests that the king might permit their marriage. Such marriages, between half-brothers and half-sisters were strictly forbidden, as tending to loosen the bends of family purity (<a href="/leviticus/18-9.htm">Leviticus 18:9</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/27-22.htm">Deuteronomy 27:22</a>); but possibly the Levitical code was occasionally violated, or Tamar may have suggested it in the hope of escaping immediate violence. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/13.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Amnon acted upon the advice, and begged his father, when he came to ask him how he was, to allow his sister Tamar to come and bake two heart-cakes for him before his eyes, which she very speedily did. &#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1489; is a denom. from &#1500;&#1489;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;, to make or bake heart-cakes. &#1500;&#1489;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; is a heart-strengthening kind of pastry, a kind of pancake, which could be very quickly made. It is evident from these verses that the king's children lived in different houses. Probably each of the king's wives lived with her children in one particular compartment of the palace.</body></html>
