We are not told why the anger of the Lord was kindled, but doubtless because He saw both in king and people that rising spirit of earthly pride and reliance on earthly strength which led to the sin.<p><span class= "bld">He moved.</span>—The pronoun here stands for “the Lord,” yet in <a href="/1_chronicles/21-1.htm" title="And Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to number Israel.">1Chronicles 21:1</a>, the temptation is attributed to Satan, and Satan is clearly meant of the devil, and not simply of “an adversary.” This is a striking instance of attributing directly to God whatever comes about under His permission. And yet it is more than that. God has established immutable spiritual as well as material laws, or rather those laws themselves are but the expression of His unchanging will. Whatever comes about under the operation of those laws is said to be His doing. Now David’s numbering the people was the natural consequence of the condition of worldliness and pride into which he had allowed himself to fall. God then moved him, because He had from the first so ordered the laws of the spirit that such a sinful act should be the natural outcome of such a sinful state. Of other interpretations: that which makes the verb impersonal—“one moved”—is hardly tenable grammatically; and that which makes the nominative a sort of compound word—“the wrath of the Lord” (as in some of the ancient versions)—leads to substantially the same explanation as that given above.<p>The word “number” in this verse is a different one from that used in the rest of the chapter, and means simply to <span class= "ital">count, </span>while the other conveys the idea of a military muster.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/2_samuel/24.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/2_samuel/24-1.htm" title="And again the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he moved David against them to say, Go, number Israel and Judah.">2 Samuel 24:1</a></span>. <span class="ital">And again — </span>After the former tokens of his anger, such as the three years’ famine, mentioned chap. 21. <span class="ital">The anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel — </span>For their sins, and on account of the following action of David. The anger of the Lord, it must be well observed, was not the cause of David’s sin, nor of the sins of the people; for God cannot be the author of sin; but David’s sin and the sins of Israel were the cause of God’s anger. <span class="ital">And he moved David against them — </span>The reader must observe that, as there is no nominative case before the verb here, in the original, to express <span class="ital">who </span>moved David, the most strict rendering of the clause would be, <span class="ital">There was who moved David against them, </span>&c. By our version, the reader is led to suppose that <span class="ital">the Lord, </span>mentioned in the foregoing part of the sentence, moved David to commit this sin of numbering the people. But this is not only quite contrary to the nature and attributes of God, but to what we are expressly told <a href="/1_chronicles/21-1.htm" title="And Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to number Israel.">1 Chronicles 21:1</a>, where we learn that it was <span class="ital">Satan, </span>and not the Lord, that moved David to do this. Here then we have a very remarkable instance, which cannot be too much regarded, to warn us against building any particular doctrine, or belief, on certain particular, detached expressions or passages of Scripture, not in harmony with the general tenor of God’s oracles; especially such doctrines as are entirely opposite to the essential nature or attributes of God. For had not this fact of David’s numbering the people been related, through the care of divine providence, by another sacred writer, who entirely clears God from having any concern in moving David to sin, it might have been concluded from the passage before us that God impelled David to this act; and, consequently, that it is consistent with the nature and government of God to excite the human mind to sinful acts: than which there can scarce be any thing more impious imagined. And therefore we may plainly see from hence, that we are not to form our notions from particular passages or expressions of the Holy Scriptures, but from the general tenor of them. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/24.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>24:1-9 For the people's sin David was left to act wrong, and in his chastisement they received punishment. This example throws light upon God's government of the world, and furnishes a useful lesson. The pride of David's heart, was his sin in numbering of the people. He thought thereby to appear the more formidable, trusting in an arm of flesh more than he should have done, and though he had written so much of trusting in God only. God judges not of sin as we do. What appears to us harmless, or, at least, but a small offence, may be a great sin in the eye of God, who discerns the thoughts and intents of the heart. Even ungodly men can discern evil tempers and wrong conduct in believers, of which they themselves often remain unconscious. But God seldom allows those whom he loves the pleasures they sinfully covet.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And again the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel - This sentence is the heading of the whole chapter, which goes on to describe the sin which kindled this anger, namely, the numbering of the people <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-7.htm">1 Chronicles 21:7-8</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/27-24.htm">1 Chronicles 27:24</a>.

Hence, our text should be rendered, "For one moved David against them."

God, though He cannot tempt any man (Jas 1:13), is frequently described in Scripture as doing what He merely permits to be done; and so, in this case, He permitted Satan to tempt David. Satan was the active mover, while God only withdrew His supporting grace, and the great tempter prevailed against the king. (See Ex 7:13; 1Sa 26:19; 2Sa 16:10; Ps 105:25; Isa 7:17, &c.). The order was given to Joab, who, though not generally restrained by religious scruples, did not fail to present, in strong terms (see on [279]1Ch 21:3), the sin and danger of this measure. He used every argument to dissuade the king from his purpose. The sacred history has not mentioned the objections which he and other distinguished officers urged against it in the council of David. But it expressly states that they were all overruled by the inflexible resolution of the king.David, tempted by Satan, forceth Joab to number the people; who are thirteen hundred thousand fighting men, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/context/2_samuel/24-1.htm" title="And again the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he moved David against them to say, Go, number Israel and Judah....">2 Samuel 24:1-9</a></span>.

The nation had sinned and incurred His anger, and He instigated David to an act which brought down a sharp punishment on the nation. The statement that God incited David to do what was afterwards condemned and punished as a heinous sin cannot of course mean that He <span class="ital">compelled</span> David to sin, but that in order to test and prove his character He allowed the temptation to assault him. Thus while we read that “God himself tempteth no man” (<a href="/james/1-13.htm" title="Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempts he any man:">James 1:13</a>), we are taught to pray “Bring us not into temptation” (<a href="/matthew/6-13.htm" title="And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For your is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.">Matthew 6:13</a>). In <a href="/1_chronicles/21-1.htm" title="And Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to number Israel.">1 Chronicles 21:1</a> we read “Satan stood up against Israel and moved David to number Israel.” The older record speaks only of God’s permissive action: the latter tells us of the malicious instrumentality of Satan. The case is like that of Job (<a href="/job/1-12.htm" title="And the LORD said to Satan, Behold, all that he has is in your power; only on himself put not forth your hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD.">Job 1:12</a>; <a href="/job/2-10.htm" title="But he said to her, You speak as one of the foolish women speaks.
