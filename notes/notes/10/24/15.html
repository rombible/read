They gloried, it is probable, in, and relied upon their numbers, and their own strength, instead of trusting in God and in his promises, for protection against, and victory over their enemies. And, therefore, it was with reason that they fell in this sad manner, to show them that all flesh is grass, and that their own strength and numbers availed nothing without God.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/24.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>24:10-15 It is well, when a man has sinned, if he has a heart within to smite him for it. If we confess our sins, we may pray in faith that God would forgive them, and take away, by pardoning mercy, that sin which we cast away by sincere repentance. What we make the matter of our pride, it is just in God to take from us, or make bitter to us, and make it our punishment. This must be such a punishment as the people have a large share in, for though it was David's sin that opened the sluice, the sins of the people all contributed to the flood. In this difficulty, David chose a judgment which came immediately from God, whose mercies he knew to be very great, rather than from men, who would have triumphed in the miseries of Israel, and have been thereby hardened in their idolatry. He chose the pestilence; he and his family would be as much exposed to it as the poorest Israelite; and he would continue for a shorter time under the Divine rebuke, however severe it was. The rapid destruction by the pestilence shows how easily God can bring down the proudest sinners, and how much we owe daily to the Divine patience.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The time appointed - Perhaps "the time of the assembly," meaning the time of the evening sacrifice, at three o'clock, when the people assembled for prayer, more commonly described as "the time of the evening oblation" <a href="/daniel/9-21.htm">Daniel 9:21</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/18-29.htm">1 Kings 18:29</a>, <a href="/1_kings/18-36.htm">1 Kings 18:36</a>; <a href="/acts/3-1.htm">Acts 3:1</a>; <a href="/luke/1-10.htm">Luke 1:10</a>.<p>Seventy thousand - It is the most destructive plague recorded as having fallen upon the Israelites.

The Plague<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">15</span>. <span class="ital">even to the time appointed</span>] The meaning of these words, which are not found in Chron., is very doubtful. (1) The E. V. follows the Vulg. <span class="ital">usque ad tempus constitutum</span>. This would naturally mean until the end of the third day; but the duration of the plague seems to have been mercifully shortened (<span class="ital"><a href="/2_samuel/24-16.htm" title="And when the angel stretched out his hand on Jerusalem to destroy it, the LORD repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed the people, It is enough: stay now your hand. And the angel of the LORD was by the threshing place of Araunah the Jebusite.">2 Samuel 24:16</a></span>). Perhaps <span class="ital">a time appointed</span> (there is no definite article) might mean a time determined in the counsel of God, before the expiration of the period originally named. (2) Most commentators render <span class="bld">until the time of assembly</span>, i.e. the hour for offering the evening sacrifice, about three o’clock in the afternoon. Cp. <a href="/1_kings/18-29.htm" title="And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that there was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded.">1 Kings 18:29</a>; <a href="/1_kings/18-36.htm" title="And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that you are God in Israel, and that I am your servant, and that I have done all these things at your word.">1 Kings 18:36</a>; <a href="/daniel/9-21.htm" title="Yes, whiles I was speaking in prayer, even the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, touched me about the time of the evening oblation.">Daniel 9:21</a>; <a href="/acts/3-1.htm" title="Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer, being the ninth hour.">Acts 3:1</a>. This is supported by the explanation given in the Targum: “from the time of the slaying of the perpetual sacrifice until it is burned;” and by Jerome (<span class="ital">Quaest. Hebr. in libros Regum</span>): “By <span class="ital">the time appointed</span> is meant that at which the evening sacrifice was offered.” (3) The Sept. rendering, <span class="ital">until the time of breakfast</span>, i.e. noon, is improbable.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Even to the time appointed.</span> This rendering, though very uncertain, is retained in the Revised Version. It would mean, of course, the end of the third day, as the pestilence was to last for that time. The objections to it are that there is no article in the Hebrew, so that literally it would be "unto a time appointed." Secondly, the pestilence did not continue unto the time appointed, but was mercifully stayed. And thirdly, these words are a literal translation, indeed, of the Vulgate, but a violation of its  meaning. For Jerome, who made the translation, says, "'tempus constitutum' means the hour when the evening sacrifice was offered" ('Tradd. Hebrews in Duos Libres Regum'). The versions all agree that the pestilence lasted only a few hours. Thus the Syriac translates, "From morning until the sixth hour," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> noon. So too the Septuagint, "From morning until the midday meal." The Vulgate adds on thrice hours, as the evening sacrifice was at the ninth hour; and this is the meaning of the Chaldee Paraphrase: "From the time the daily sacrifice was slain until it was burnt." As the word <span class="accented">moed</span> used here means both a time or place appointed for a meeting, and also the meeting itself, the right translation probably is, "From the morning even to the time of assembly," or, as we should say, "the hour of service." <span class="accented">Moed</span> was the regular word for the time of the temple service, derived from the old name of the tabernacle, which was called "the tent of <span class="accented">moed"</span> (see <a href="/numbers/16-19.htm">Numbers 16:19</a>, etc.), rendered iu the Authorized Version, "the tabernacle of the congregation," and in the Revised Version, "the tent of meeting." The hour would thus be the ninth, or three o'clock in the afternoon. <span class="cmt_word">Seventy thousand men.</span> This is a vast number to fall victims of the pestilence in so short a time, as even the most dangerous forms of sickness take some days for their development. But similarly the army of Sennacherib was cut off in a night (<a href="/isaiah/37-36.htm">Isaiah 37:36</a>); as were the firstborn in Egypt, whose visitation more nearly resembles the course of this pestilence; and the rapidity of the death blow, striking down so vast a multitude suddenly throughout all parts of the land, would be proof to every mind that the mortality was the Divine chastisement for national sin. It is possible, nevertheless, that the black death cloud, bringing with it the plague, may have been settling down upon the land previously, and have alarmed David, and brought him to repentance; and though no new cases occurred after the offering of his burnt offerings (ver. 25), yet it by no means follows that all cases of infection were miraculously cured. The malady may have run in them its normal course. It was Jerusalem that was saved from the blow, and, after the offering of the burnt offering, the pestilence smote down no more. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/24.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When they had traversed the whole land, they came back to Jerusalem, at the end of nine months and twenty days, and handed over to the king the number of the people mustered: viz., 800,000 men of Israel fit for military service, drawing the sword, and 500,000 men of Judah. According to the Chronicles (<a href="/1_chronicles/21-5.htm">1 Chronicles 21:5</a>), there were 1,100,000 Israelites and 470,000 Judaeans. The numbers are not given by thousands, and therefore are only approximative statements in round numbers; and the difference in the two texts arose chiefly from the fact, that the statements were merely founded upon oral tradition, since, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-4.htm">1 Chronicles 27:4</a>, the result of the census was not inserted in the annals of the kingdom. There is no ground, however, for regarding the numbers as exaggerated, if we only bear in mind that the entire population of a land amounts to about four times the number of those who are fit for military service, and therefore 1,300,000, or even a million and a half, would only represent a total population of five or six millions, - a number which could undoubtedly have been sustained in Palestine, according to thoroughly reliable testimony as to its unusual fertility (see the discussion of this subject at <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/1.htm">Numbers 1-4</a>, Pentateuch, pp. 651-57). Still less can we adduce as a proof of exaggeration the fact, that according to <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-1.htm">1 Chronicles 27:1-15</a>, David had only an army of 288,000; for it is a well-known fact, that in all lands the army, or number of men in actual service, is, as a rule, much smaller than the total number of those who are capable of bearing arms. According to <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-6.htm">1 Chronicles 21:6</a>, the tribes of Levi and Benjamin were not numbered, because, as the chronicler adds, giving his own subjective view, "the word of the king was an abomination to Joab," or, as it is affirmed in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-4.htm">1 Chronicles 27:4</a>, according to the objective facts, "because the numbering was not completed." It is evident from this, that in consequence of Joab's repugnance to the numbering of the people, he had not hurried with the fulfilment of the kings' command; so that when David saw his own error, he revoked the command before the census was complete, and so the tribe of Benjamin was not numbered at all, the tribe of Levi being of course eo ipso exempt from a census that was taken for the sake of ascertaining the number of men who were capable of bearing arms. </body></html>
