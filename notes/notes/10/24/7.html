This example throws light upon God's government of the world, and furnishes a useful lesson. The pride of David's heart, was his sin in numbering of the people. He thought thereby to appear the more formidable, trusting in an arm of flesh more than he should have done, and though he had written so much of trusting in God only. God judges not of sin as we do. What appears to us harmless, or, at least, but a small offence, may be a great sin in the eye of God, who discerns the thoughts and intents of the heart. Even ungodly men can discern evil tempers and wrong conduct in believers, of which they themselves often remain unconscious.

Tyre and the whole coast land between it and Sidon had been too strong for the tribe of Asher, and remained unsubdued. But, like the independent states in India, it acknowlodged the supremacy of the paramount power. <span class="cmt_word">The cities of the Hivites, and of the Canaanites.</span> It is evident from this that even in David's time there were towns and districts were Hivites and Canaanites dwelt as distinct communities, governed probably by their own laws. But as they were bound to serve in the Israelite armies, they were included in the census, and possibly one of its rosin objects was to learn the number of fighting men of alien races dwelling in Israel. They seem to have been reckoned as belonging to the tribe in whose borders they dwelt. So Baanah and Rechab, the murderers of Ishbosheth, though Beerothites (and therefore Gibeonites, who again were Hivites), were counted to Benjamin (<a href="/2_samuel/4-2.htm">2 Samuel 4:2</a>). These Gentile communities were chiefly to be found in the north, for which reason it was called "the circuit (<span class="accented">Gelil</span>) of the nations" (<a href="/isaiah/9-1.htm">Isaiah 9:1</a>), and in later times from <span class="accented">Gelil</span> came the name Galilee. The Syriac adds "Jebusites," and we find Jerusalem occupied by a community of Jebusites living in independence in the very neighbourhood of the warlike tribe of Benjamin (<a href="/2_samuel/5-6.htm">2 Samuel 5:6</a>). This numbering of the aborigines by David is referred to in <a href="/2_chronicles/2-17.htm">2 Chronicles 2:17</a>, where it is added that Solomon made a separate census of them, and found that there were in Israel no fewer than a hundred and fifty-three thousand six hundred of these aliens. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/24.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Again the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Israel; and He moved David against them, saying, Go, number Israel and Judah." &#1500;&#1495;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; ... &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1505;&#1507; points back to the manifestation of the wrath of God, which Israel had experienced in the three years' famine (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/21.htm">2 Samuel 21</a>). Just as that plague had burst upon the land on account of the guilt which rested upon the people, so the kindling of the wrath of God against Israel a second time also presupposes guilt on the part of the nation; and as this is not expressly pointed out, we may seek for it generally in the rebellions of Absalom and Sheba against the divinely established government of David. The subject to "moved" is Jehovah, and the words "against them" point back to Israel. Jehovah instigated David against Israel to the performance of an act which brought down a severe judgment upon the nation. With regard to the idea that God instigates to sin, see the remarks on <a href="/1_samuel/26-19.htm">1 Samuel 26:19</a>. In the parallel text of the Chronicles, Satan is mentioned as the tempter to evil, through whom Jehovah had David to number the people.</body></html>
