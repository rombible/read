In <a href="/1_chronicles/21-25.htm" title="So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight.">1Chronicles 21:25</a>, it reads “six hundred shekels of gold by weight.” One of the most ingenious propositions for the reconciliation of the two statements is that our text speaks of fifty shekels, not of silver but of money, and that Chronicles means that these were of gold, in value equal to 600 shekels of silver. But the explanation is quite inconsistent with the text in both places. In one of them the statement of price must have been altered in transcription. In the entire uncertainty as to the extent of the purchase of Araunah (the whole hill of Moriah, or only a part), and of the value of land in the locality and at the time, it is impossible to decide between the two.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/2_samuel/24.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/2_samuel/24-24.htm" title="And the king said to Araunah, No; but I will surely buy it of you at a price: neither will I offer burnt offerings to the LORD my God of that which does cost me nothing.

David purchased the ground to build the altar. God hates robbery for burnt-offering. Those know not what religion is, who chiefly care to make it cheap and easy to themselves, and who are best pleased with that which costs them least pains or money. For what have we our substance, but to honour God with it; and how can it be better bestowed? See the building of the altar, and the offering proper sacrifices upon it. Burnt-offerings to the glory of God's justice; peace-offerings to the glory of his mercy. Christ is our Altar, our Sacrifice; in him alone we may expect to escape his wrath, and to find favour with God.

In explanation, it is supposed - that the fifty shekels here mentioned were gold shekels, each worth twelve silver shekels, so that the fifty gold shekels are equal to the 600 silver; that our text should be rendered, "David bought the threshing-floor and the oxen for money," namely, "fifty shekels;" and that the passage in Chronicles should be rendered, "David qave to Ornan gold shekels of the value" (or weight) "of 600 shekels."

First, Here he speaks of the price paid for the threshing-floor, and oxen, and instruments; and there for the whole place adjoining, on which the temple and its courts were built, which certainly was very much larger than this threshing-floor, and probably had Araunah’s house, if not some others, now built upon it. Secondly, The shekels here may be of gold, and in <span class="bld"> 1Ch 21</span> of silver; and so the proportion of gold to silver being that of twelve to one, fifty shekels of gold make six hundred shekels of silver. And whereas it may be objected, that on the contrary these fifty shekels are said to be of silver, and the six hundred of gold, this they answer by another translation of the words. For they render this place thus, agreeably enough to the words and the order of the Hebrew text, he <span class="ital">bought</span> them for <span class="ital">silver</span>, (or, for money, as the Hebrew word <span class="ital">chesoph</span> oft signifies, and particularly in this very history in the parallel place, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/1_chronicles/21-24.htm" title="And king David said to Ornan, No; but I will truly buy it for the full price: for I will not take that which is your for the LORD, nor offer burnt offerings without cost.">1 Chronicles 21:24</a></span>, where David desires to buy it <span class="ital">for the full price</span>, or for <span class="ital">full money</span>, where in the Hebrew it is for <span class="ital">full silver</span>,) even <span class="ital">for fifty shekels</span>, to wit, of gold, as it is expressed <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/1_chronicles/21-25.htm" title="So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight.">1 Chronicles 21:25</a></span>; which place they render thus, and that consonantly to the Hebrew, <span class="ital">he gave shekels of gold of the value</span> (for the Hebrew word <span class="ital">mishkal</span> signifies value as well as weight, as was before noted on <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/2_samuel/12-30.htm" title="And he took their king's crown from off his head, the weight whereof was a talent of gold with the precious stones: and it was set on David's head.

And this may seem added in the Book of the Chronicles, lest it should be thought that the fifty shekels here mentioned were but common and silver shekels. Thirdly, There is a considerable difference in the phrase in these two places: here he mentions for what David <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">bought</span> it, or what he was obliged to give for it; and in Chronicles what he actually gave for it, to wit, of his royal bounty, over and besides the full price of it; which was decent and convenient for so great a king, and especially upon so great an occasion, and to him who had given him such a noble example. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/24.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the king said unto Araunah, nay, but I will surely buy it of thee at a price,....

Bochart and Noldius have taken another way, but not so clear and satisfactory; the Septuagint of <a href="/1_chronicles/21-25.htm">1 Chronicles 21:25</a> has fifty shekels, as here. <p>(i) T. Bab.

There is a superficial, but no real discrepancy between these two narratives. David gave the fifty shekels for the immediate use of the place, and for the oxen and implements. He had no idea at the time of permanently occupying it, and probably the note in the LXX., interpolated by scribes from the margin into the text, is true, "And Solomon added to the altar afterwards, for it was small at the first." It was a small altar hurriedly put together for the purpose of offering one sacrifice; and fifty shekels would be full compensation. But the sacrifice had hallowed the spot, and, when finally it was selected as the site for the temple, David bought the whole area and all that Araunah possessed there. Fifty shekels of silver would be about &pound;9; six hundred shekels of gold would be about &pound;1500; so that there is no comparison between the two sums. But the precious metals were worth very much more in David's time than in ours, so that the smaller sum was adequate compensation for David's first acquisition, while the larger implies the purchase of an extensive and valuable estate. Substantially the fuller narrative in Chronicles agrees with this. David refuses to sacrifice of that which cost him nothing, and must therefore have at once paid for what he took. But When God accepted his offering, and answered him by fire from heaven, then David said, "This is the house of the Lord God, and this is the altar of the burnt offering for Israel." And as the Chronicler has in view throughout the selection of the site for the temple, he naturally mentions its full cost. In the Book of Samuel this purpose is not expressly mentioned, and the narrative closes with the forgiveness of the sin both of David and his people. Jehovah was entreated for the land, and the plague was stayed. But this sudden smiting down of so large a host humbled both king and people, and their eagerness for war and their lust of empire ceased. ?

David was to build the altar and offer burnt-offerings and supplicatory-offerings upon it, to appease the wrath of Jehovah. The plague would then be averted from Israel. </body></html>
