David purchased the ground to build the altar. God hates robbery for burnt-offering. Those know not what religion is, who chiefly care to make it cheap and easy to themselves, and who are best pleased with that which costs them least pains or money. For what have we our substance, but to honour God with it; and how can it be better bestowed? See the building of the altar, and the offering proper sacrifices upon it. Burnt-offerings to the glory of God's justice; peace-offerings to the glory of his mercy. Christ is our Altar, our Sacrifice; in him alone we may expect to escape his wrath, and to find favour with God. Death is destroying all around, in so many forms, and so suddenly, that it is madness not to expect and prepare for the close of life.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Compare the passage in Chronicles.

In an agony of grief, he poured out his prayer that Jerusalem might be spared, and God heard him, and sent Gad a second time to bid him offer sacrifice, that, by making an  atonement, he might stand between the dead and the living, as Aaron had done in the wilderness (<a href="/numbers/16-46.htm">Numbers 16:46-48</a>) He is therefore to leave the tabernacle, and mount up to the summit on which Araunah's threshing floor was situated. We read in <a href="/1_chronicles/21-28.htm">1 Chronicles 21:28-30</a> that David wished to go to Gibeon, where the Mosaic tabernacle and altar of burnt offering were, to inquire of God, but that he was afraid, as the angel of the pestilence was smiting outside the walls. This is mentioned as an excuse for his offering at an unconsecrated spot. But it also suggests that David's choice was a submission to a chastisement already at work. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/24.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When he rose up in the morning, after he had calmly reflected upon the matter during the night upon his bed, and had been brought to see the folly of his determination, the prophet Gad came to him by the command of God, pointed out to him his fault, and foretold the punishment that would come from God. "Shall seven years of famine come upon thy land, or three months of flight before thine oppressors that they may pursue thee, or shall there be three days of pestilence in thy land? Now mark and see what answer I shall bring to Him that sendeth me."

Instead of &#1506;&#1500; &#1504;&#1496;&#1500;, to lay upon, we find &#1504;&#1496;&#1492; in the Chronicles, "to turn upon thee." The three things are mentioned first of all in connection with the execution of Gad's commission to the king. Instead of seven years of famine, we find three years in the Chronicles; the Septuagint has also the number three in the passage before us, and apparently it is more in harmony with the connection, viz., three evils to choose from, and each lasting through three divisions of time. But this agreement favours the seven rather than the three, which is open to the suspicion of being intentionally made to conform to the rest. &#1504;&#1505;&#1498; is an infinitive: "thy fleeing," for that thou fliest before thine enemies. In the Chronicles the last two evils are described more fully, but the thought is not altered in consequence.</body></html>
