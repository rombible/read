David purchased the ground to build the altar. God hates robbery for burnt-offering. Those know not what religion is, who chiefly care to make it cheap and easy to themselves, and who are best pleased with that which costs them least pains or money. For what have we our substance, but to honour God with it; and how can it be better bestowed? See the building of the altar, and the offering proper sacrifices upon it. Burnt-offerings to the glory of God's justice; peace-offerings to the glory of his mercy. Christ is our Altar, our Sacrifice; in him alone we may expect to escape his wrath, and to find favour with God.

Previous to the offering of this sacrifice, he had seen the destroying angel as well as offered the intercessory prayer (2Sa 24:17). This was a sacrifice of expiation; and the reason why he was allowed to offer it on Mount Moriah was partly in gracious consideration to his fear of repairing to Gibeon (1Ch 21:29, 30), and partly in anticipation of the removal of the tabernacle and the erection of the temple there (2Ch 3:1).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/24.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Here be oxen; </span> which were employed by him in his present work, which was threshing, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/1_chronicles/21-20.htm" title="And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons with him hid themselves.

"When the destroying angel ('the angel' is defined immediately afterwards as 'the angel that destroyed the people') stretched out his hand towards Jerusalem to destroy it, Jehovah repented of the evil (for this expression, see <a href="/exodus/32-14.htm">Exodus 32:14</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-13.htm">Jeremiah 26:13</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-19.htm">Jeremiah 26:19</a>, etc.; and for the repentance of God, the remarks on <a href="/genesis/6-6.htm">Genesis 6:6</a>), and He commanded the angel, Enough! stay now thine hand." This implies that the progress of the pestilence was stayed before Jerusalem, and therefore that Jerusalem itself was spared. "And the angel of Jehovah was at the threshing-floor of Aravnah the Jebusite." These words affirm most distinctly that the destroying angel was visible. According to <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-17.htm">2 Samuel 24:17</a>, David saw him there. The visible appearance of the angel was to exclude every thought of a natural land plague. The appearance of the angel is described more minutely in the Chronicles: David saw him standing by the threshing-floor of Aravnah between heaven and earth with a drawn sword in his hand, stretched out over Jerusalem. The drawn sword was a symbolical representation of the purpose of his coming (see at <a href="/numbers/22-23.htm">Numbers 22:23</a> and <a href="/joshua/5-13.htm">Joshua 5:13</a>). The threshing-floor of Aravnah was situated, like all other threshing-floors, outside the city, and upon an eminence, or, according to the more precise statement which follows, to the north-east of Zion, upon Mount Moriah (see at <a href="/2_samuel/24-25.htm">2 Samuel 24:25</a>). According to the Chethib of <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-16.htm">2 Samuel 24:16</a>, the name of the owner of the floor was &#1492;&#1488;&#1493;&#1512;&#1504;&#1492;, of <a href="/2_samuel/24-18.htm">2 Samuel 24:18</a> &#1488;&#1512;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492;, and of <a href="/2_samuel/24-20.htm">2 Samuel 24:20</a> (twice) &#1488;&#1512;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492;. This last form also occurs in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-22.htm">2 Samuel 24:22</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-23.htm">2 Samuel 24:23</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-24.htm">2 Samuel 24:24</a>, and has been substituted by the Masoretes as the Keri in <a href="/2_samuel/24-16.htm">2 Samuel 24:16</a> and <a href="/2_samuel/24-18.htm">2 Samuel 24:18</a>. In the Chronicles, on the other hand, the name is always written &#1488;&#1512;&#1504;&#1503; (Ornan), and hence in the Septuagint we find &#x39f;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1; in both texts. "The form &#1488;&#1512;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492; (Aravnah) has not a Hebrew stamp, whereas Orna and Ornan are true Hebrew formations. But for this very reason Aravnah appears to be derived from an ancient tradition" (Bertheau).</body></html>
