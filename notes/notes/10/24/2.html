This example throws light upon God's government of the world, and furnishes a useful lesson. The pride of David's heart, was his sin in numbering of the people. He thought thereby to appear the more formidable, trusting in an arm of flesh more than he should have done, and though he had written so much of trusting in God only. God judges not of sin as we do. What appears to us harmless, or, at least, but a small offence, may be a great sin in the eye of God, who discerns the thoughts and intents of the heart. Even ungodly men can discern evil tempers and wrong conduct in believers, of which they themselves often remain unconscious. But God seldom allows those whom he loves the pleasures they sinfully covet.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div><a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-2.htm">1 Chronicles 21:2</a>, supplies some missing words.

God, though He cannot tempt any man (Jas 1:13), is frequently described in Scripture as doing what He merely permits to be done; and so, in this case, He permitted Satan to tempt David. Satan was the active mover, while God only withdrew His supporting grace, and the great tempter prevailed against the king. (See Ex 7:13; 1Sa 26:19; 2Sa 16:10; Ps 105:25; Isa 7:17, &c.). The order was given to Joab, who, though not generally restrained by religious scruples, did not fail to present, in strong terms (see on [279]1Ch 21:3), the sin and danger of this measure. He used every argument to dissuade the king from his purpose. The sacred history has not mentioned the objections which he and other distinguished officers urged against it in the council of David.

They were associated with Joab in the work, just as the princes of the tribes were associated with Moses and Aaron in taking the census (<a href="/numbers/1-4.htm" title="And with you there shall be a man of every tribe; every one head of the house of his fathers.">Numbers 1:4</a> ff.), and this indicates that the census had some military object in view.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the king said;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">and the king said.</span> David's command was not the cause of Jehovah's auger, but the result of his having himself given way to ambition; and, as he yielded to the temptation, it so far became an act of Satan, in that it led to  sin; but in its final result it led to good, in that the chastisement cured the people of their thirst for war. And as Satan can act only so far as the Divine will permits, the temptation was most truly the doing of Jehovah (but see note on 1 Samuel 26:19). <span class="cmt_word">Captain of the host, which was with him.</span> There is a good deal of difficulty about this passage, as the word for "host" is not that elsewhere used, and the last phrase is somewhat meaningless. In <a href="/1_chronicles/21-2.htm">1 Chronicles 21:2</a> we find "David said to Joab and to the rulers of the people." Without the concurrence of these rulers, who were the princes of the tribes, the census could not have been taken. But as the ancient versions confirm the reading of the Hebrew here, no change of the text is admissible. <span class="cmt_word">Number ye.</span> This is distinctly the war word, for which see note on 2 Samuel 18:1. It proves that the census was taken for military reasons. Even this in itself was not wrong (<a href="/numbers/26-2.htm">Numbers 26:2</a>), but it is indicative of David's purpose. When, moreover, Moses numbered the people, the census was taken by the priests (<a href="/numbers/1-3.htm">Numbers 1:3</a>; <a href="/numbers/26-1.htm">Numbers 26:1, 2</a>), and from the payment of the half shekel to the sanctuary, it appears that it was to some extent a religious ceremony. All this David neglects, and the employment of Joab goes far to prove that what David wanted was an examination of the military resources of his kingdom. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/23.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Hezro the Carmelite, i.e., of Carmel in the mountains of Judah (<a href="/1_samuel/25-2.htm">1 Samuel 25:2</a>).
