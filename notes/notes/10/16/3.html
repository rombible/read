But David’s mind was both clouded by his trouble, and biased by Ziba’s great and seasonable kindness. And he thought, probably, Ziba would not dare accuse his master, except on good grounds, of so great a crime as that of being a <span class="ital">traitor, </span>which, if false, might be so easily disproved. <span class="ital">Ziba said, that I may find grace in thy sight, my lord, O king — </span>Thus he hypocritically pretends to value the king’s favour more than the gift he had bestowed upon him.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/16.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>16:1-4 Ziba belied Mephibosheth.

David asks the question, evidently hurt at the apparent ingratitude of Mephibosheth. It is impossible to say whether Mephibosheth was quite guiltless or not. If <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/116.htm">Psalm 116</a> was composed by David, and after the quelling of Absalom's rebellion, <a href="/2_samuel/16-11.htm">2 Samuel 16:11</a> may contain David's confession of his present hasty judgment <a href="/2_samuel/16-4.htm">2 Samuel 16:4</a> in the matter. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. To-day shall the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father&#8212;Such a hope might not unnaturally arise at this period of civil distraction, that the family of David would destroy themselves by their mutual broils, and the people reinstate the old dynasty. There was an air of plausibility in Ziba's story. Many, on whom the king had conferred favors, were now deserting him. No wonder, therefore, that in the excitement of momentary feeling, believing, on the report of a slanderer, Mephibosheth to be among the number, he pronounced a rash and unrighteous judgment by which a great injury was inflicted on the character and interests of a devoted friend.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Which though it might seem a very unlikely thing, yet such vain expectations do often get into the minds of men; nor was it impossible, that when David’s family was thus divided, and one part engaged against another, they might destroy themselves by mutual wounds; and the people being tired out with civil wars, might restore the kingdom to the family of Saul their old master, whereof this was the top branch. And this was a time of general defection of many whom the king had greatly obliged, witness Ahithophel. And Mephibosheth’s absence made the calumny more probable. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/16.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the king said, and where is thy master's son?....

David was hurt by Mephibosheth’s apparent ingratitude.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">for he said, To day</span>, &c.] That Ziba was calumniating Mephibosheth is sufficiently obvious. How could Mephibosheth, an insignificant cripple, who had never claimed the crown, or taken any part in politics, expect to be made king, even in the confusion of parties which might ensue upon Absalom’s rebellion? Ziba’s story was an audacious fiction, invented in the hope of getting a grant of the estate which he was cultivating for Mephibosheth’s benefit, and in spite of its improbability, it passed muster in the haste and confusion of the moment.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thy master's son;</span> that is, the son of Jonathan, or even of Saul, as the word "son" is used very indefinitely in Hebrew. Mephibesheth held the property as their representative. <span class="cmt_word">Today shall the house,</span> etc. Ziba's slander was absurd. Mephibosheth was likely to meet with no kind treatment from Absalom; but perhaps he was a visionary, and David may have thought that he was holding back for any chance that might turn up. But upon this slander David acts with blamable impetuosity, and, indignant that the son of his old friend should so desert him, he gives Ziba all his lands. The grant would be valid only if David's cause prevailed, and Ziba so far deserves credit in that he attached himself to a ruined man; but his motive was not love to David, but selfish calculation. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>On David's arrival at the height where people were accustomed to worship, i.e., upon the top of the Mount of Olives, the Archite Hushai came to meet him with his clothes rent and earth upon his head, that is to say, in the deepest mourning (see <a href="/1_samuel/4-12.htm">1 Samuel 4:12</a>). It is evident from the words &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1470;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1492; that there was a place of worship upon the top of the Mount of Olives, probably a bamah, such as continued to exist in different places throughout the land, even after the building of the temple. According to <a href="/2_samuel/15-37.htm">2 Samuel 15:37</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-16.htm">2 Samuel 16:16</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-33.htm">1 Chronicles 27:33</a>, Hushai was &#1512;&#1506;&#1492;, a friend of David, i.e., one of his privy councillors. &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497; (the Archite), if we may judge from Jos 16:2, was the name of a family whose possessions were upon the southern boundary of the tribe of Ephraim, between Bethel and Ataroth. Hushai was probably a very old man, as David said to him (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-33.htm">2 Samuel 15:33</a>, <a href="/2_samuel/15-34.htm">2 Samuel 15:34</a>), "If thou goest with me, thou wilt be a burden to me. But if thou returnest to the city and offerest Absalom thy services, thou canst bring for me the counsel of Ahithophel to nought. If thou sayest to Absalom, I will be thy servant, O king; servant of thy father (i.e., as regards this) I was that of old, but now I am thy servant."
