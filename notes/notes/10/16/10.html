David, throughout, recognises that all his sufferings were from the Lord’s hand, and he wishes to submit himself entirely to His will. He does not, of course, mean to justify Shimei’s wrong; but only to say that, as far as his sin bears upon himself, it is of Divine appointment and he cannot resent it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/2_samuel/16.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/2_samuel/16-10.htm" title="And the king said, What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah? so let him curse, because the LORD has said to him, Curse David.

We cannot suppose David meant that God, strictly speaking, had either bid Shimei curse him, or had excited him so to do: but merely that, his heart being full of malice and rage, God had now put it into his power to give full vent to these diabolical passions as a punishment to David. Unto this the good king humbly submits, looking upon it as coming from the hand of God, who had delivered him up to this contempt. And in this David’s patience and meekness were admirable, for it is not an easy thing to stifle all emotions of revenge when there is a high provocation to it, and no difficulty in taking it. David did not scorn these curses as proceeding from the mouth of a base wretch, not worthy to be regarded, but acknowledged that his sins had merited this chastisement, and that God was just in suffering him to be afflicted with it. <span class="ital">Who shall then say, Wherefore hast thou done so? — </span>Who shall reproach God’s providence for permitting this?

Once and again David spared Saul's life, while Saul sought his. But innocence is no defence against malice and falsehood; nor are we to think it strange, if we are charged with that which we have been most careful to keep ourselves from. It is well for us, that men are not to be our judges, but He whose judgment is according to truth. See how patient David was under this abuse. Let this remind us of Christ, who prayed for those who reviled and crucified him. A humble spirit will turn reproaches into reproofs, and get good from them, instead of being provoked by them. David the hand of God in it, and comforts himself that God would bring good out of his affliction. We may depend upon God to repay, not only our services, but our sufferings.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>What have I to do ... - See the marginal references compare <a href="/matthew/8-29.htm">Matthew 8:29</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/john/2-4.htm">John 2:4</a>, and a similar complaint about the sons of Zeruiah <a href="/2_samuel/3-39.htm">2 Samuel 3:39</a>.

Shimei Curses David.<p>5-12. when king David came to Bahurim&#8212;a city of Benjamin (2Sa 3:16; 19:16). It is, however, only the confines of the district that are here meant.<p>Shimei, &#8230; a man of the family of Saul&#8212;The misfortune of his family, and the occupation by David of what they considered their rightful possessions, afforded a natural, if not a justifiable cause for this ebullition of rude insults and violence. He upbraided David as an ambitious usurper, and charged him, as one whose misdeeds had recoiled upon his own head, to surrender a throne to which he was not entitled. His language was that of a man incensed by the wrongs that he conceived had been done to his house. David was guiltless of the crime of which Shimei accused him; but his conscience reminded him of other flagrant iniquities; and he, therefore, regarded the cursing of this man as a chastisement from heaven. His answer to Abishai's proposal evinced the spirit of deep and humble resignation&#8212;the spirit of a man who watched the course of Providence, and acknowledged Shimei as the instrument of God's chastening hand. One thing is remarkable, that he acted more independently of the sons of Zeruiah in this season of great distress than he could often muster courage to do in the days of his prosperity and power.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">What have I to do with you?</span> to wit, in this matter I ask not your advice, nor will I follow it; nor do I desire you should at all concern yourselves in it, but wholly leave it to me, to do what I think fit. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Because the Lord hath said unto him; </span> not that God commanded it by his word, for that severely forbids it, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/exodus/22-28.htm" title="You shall not revile the gods, nor curse the ruler of your people.">Exodus 22:28</a></span>; or moved him to it by his Spirit, for neither was that necessary nor possible, because <span class="ital">God tempteth no man</span>, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/james/1-13.htm" title="Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempts he any man:">Jam 1:13</a></span>; but that the secret providence of God did order and overrule him in it. God did not put any wickedness into Shimei’s heart, for he had of himself a heart full of malignity and venom against David; but only left him to his own wickedness; took away that common prudence which would have kept him from so foolish and dangerous an action; directed his malice that it should be exercised against David, rather than another man, as when God gives up one traveller into the hands of a robber rather than another; inclined him to be at home, and then to come out of his doors at that time when David passed by him; and brought David into so distressed a condition, that he might seem a proper object of his scorn and contempt.

It seems as if Joab, the brother of Abishai, joined with him in this request to have leave to take off the head of Shimei; and though David had to do with them as his relations, his sister's sons, and as they were generals in his army; yet in this case he would have nothing to do with them, would not take their advice, nor suffer them to take revenge on this man for his cursing him: or "what is it to me, or to you" (u)? what signifies his cursing? it will neither hurt me nor you: <p>so let him curse; go on cursing after this manner; do not restrain him from it, or attempt to stop his mouth: or, "for he will curse" (w); so is the textual reading; you will not be able to restrain him, for the following reason: <p>because the Lord hath said unto him, curse David; not by way of command, or a precept of his; for to curse the ruler of the people is contrary to the word and law of God, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/22-28.htm">Exodus 22:28</a>, nor by any operation of his spirit moving and exciting him to it; for the operations of the Spirit are to holiness, and not to sin; but by the secret providence of God ordering, directing, and overruling all circumstances relative to this affair. Shimei had conceived enmity and hatred to David; God left him to the power of this corruption in his breast, opened a way in Providence, and gave him an opportunity of exercising it on him: it was not a bare permission of God that Shimei should curse David; but it was his will, and he ordered it so in Providence, that he should do it; which action was attended with the predetermined concourse of divine Providence, so far as it was an action; though, as a sinful action, it was of Shimei, sprung from his own heart, instigated by Satan; but as a correction and chastisement of David, it was by the will, order, and appointment of God, and as such David considered it, and quietly submitted to it: <p>who shall then say, wherefore hast thou done so? for though Shimei might justly be blamed, and reproved for it, yet the thing itself was not to be hindered or restrained, it being according to the will and providence of God, to answer some good end with respect to David. <p>(u)   "quid mihi et vobis", V.
