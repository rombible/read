Once and again David spared Saul's life, while Saul sought his. But innocence is no defence against malice and falsehood; nor are we to think it strange, if we are charged with that which we have been most careful to keep ourselves from. It is well for us, that men are not to be our judges, but He whose judgment is according to truth. See how patient David was under this abuse. Let this remind us of Christ, who prayed for those who reviled and crucified him. A humble spirit will turn reproaches into reproofs, and get good from them, instead of being provoked by them. David the hand of God in it, and comforts himself that God would bring good out of his affliction.

It is clear from ch. <a href="/2_samuel/17-18.htm" title="Nevertheless a lad saw them, and told Absalom: but they went both of them away quickly, and came to a man's house in Bahurim, which had a well in his court; where they went down.">2 Samuel 17:18</a>, that the halting-place was not Bahurim, but some place beyond it. We must suppose that the name of the place has fallen out of the text, or that the word for <span class="ital">weary</span> should be taken as a proper name <span class="ital">to Ayêphîm</span>. No such place is known, but it would be an appropriate name for a caravansary or resting-place for travellers.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Weary</span>. Evidently the name of a place; for David "refreshed himself there." It was probably a caravanserai, the full name of which was, "Rest for the weary," but gradually the title was shortened down to the last word, "Weary," Hebrew <span class="accented">Ayephim</span>, which the Revised Version puts as a proper name in the margin. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/16.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Shimei cursed thus: "Out, out (away, away), thou man of blood, and worthless man! Jehovah hath repaid thee (now) for all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast become king, and hath given the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son. Behold, now thou art in thy misfortune, for thou art a man of blood." &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, a man of drops of blood, i.e., one who has shed blood or committed murder. What Shimei meant by "all the blood of the house of Saul," which David had shed, and because of which he was a man of blood, it is impossible to determine with certainty. He may possibly have attributed to David the murder of Ishbosheth and Abner, notwithstanding the fact that David was innocent of the death of both (see <a href="/2_samuel/3-27.htm">2 Samuel 3:27</a>., and <a href="/2_samuel/4-6.htm">2 Samuel 4:6</a>.). By "in whose stead thou hast reigned," he meant whose throne thou hast forcibly usurped; and by &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1506;&#1514;&#1498; &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1498;, "it is for this that punishment hat overtaken thee now."  </body></html>
