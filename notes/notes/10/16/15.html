When David quitted Jerusalem, it was upon a persuasion that Absalom would make all the haste he could to possess himself of the capital, and, if possible, to surprise his father in it.

But miserable counsellors were they both. Hushai would never counsel him to do wisely. Ahithophel counselled him to do wickedly; and so did as effectually betray him, as he did, who was designedly false to him: for they that advise men to sin, certainly advise them to their hurt. After all, honesty is the best policy, and will be found so in the long run. Ahithophel gave wicked counsel to Absalom; to render himself so hateful to his father, that he would never be reconciled to him; this cursed policy was of the devil.

Hushai said unto Absalom, God save the king&#8212;Hushai's devotion to David was so well-known, that his presence in the camp of the conspirators excited great surprise. Professing, however, with great address, to consider it his duty to support the cause which the course of Providence and the national will had seemingly decreed should triumph, and urging his friendship for the father as a ground of confidence in his fidelity to the son, he persuaded Absalom of his sincerity, and was admitted among the councillors of the new king.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/16.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Absalom, and all the people, the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem,....

It is used in a general sense, and not to signify the northern tribes as distinguished from Judah, for the strength of the insurrection, originally at any rate, lay in the south. See note on ch. <a href="/2_samuel/15-10.htm" title="But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet, then you shall say, Absalom reigns in Hebron.">2 Samuel 15:10</a>. Those who remained faithful to David are never called <span class="ital">the men of Judah</span>, but simply <span class="ital">the people</span> (ch. <a href="/2_samuel/15-17.htm" title="And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and tarried in a place that was far off.">2 Samuel 15:17</a>; <a href="/context/2_samuel/15-23.htm" title="And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness....">2 Samuel 15:23-24</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/15-30.htm" title="And David went up by the ascent of mount Olivet, and wept as he went up, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot: and all the people that was with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up.">2 Samuel 15:30</a>; 2 Samuel 16, 17, 18, 19).<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/16.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Abishai wanted to put an end to this cursing (on the expression "dead dog," see <a href="/2_samuel/9-8.htm">2 Samuel 9:8</a>). "Let me go," said he to David, "and take away his head," i.e., chop off his head. But David replied, "What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah?" Joab probably joined with Abishai. The formula "what to me and you?" signifies that a person did not wish to have anything in common with the feelings and views of another (cf. <a href="/1_kings/17-18.htm">1 Kings 17:18</a>; <a href="/joshua/22-24.htm">Joshua 22:24</a>; and &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;, <a href="/john/2-4.htm">John 2:4</a>. For the thing itself, comp. <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/9-52.htm">Luke 9:52-56</a>). "If he curses, and if Jehovah hath said to him, Curse David, who shall then say, Wherefore hast thou done so?" For &#1497;&#1492; &#1493;&#1499;&#1497; &#1497;&#1511;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; (Chethib), the Masoretes give us the Keri, &#1497;&#1492; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1497;&#1511;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500; &#1499;&#1468;&#1492;, "so let him curse, for Jehovah," etc. This thought lies at the foundation of the rendering adopted by the lxx, who have inserted, by way of explanation, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768;: so let him go, and so may he curse. The Vulgate is just the same: dimittite eum ut maledicat. This interpolation is taken from <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-11.htm">2 Samuel 16:11</a>, and, like the Keri, is nothing more than a conjecture, which was adopted simply because &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; was taken as a causal particle, and then offence was taken at &#1493;&#1499;&#1497;. But &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; signifies if, quando, in this passage, and the &#1493; before the following &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497; introduces the apodosis. </body></html>
