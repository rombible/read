It is evident from the words &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1470;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1492; that there was a place of worship upon the top of the Mount of Olives, probably a bamah, such as continued to exist in different places throughout the land, even after the building of the temple. According to <a href="/2_samuel/15-37.htm">2 Samuel 15:37</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-16.htm">2 Samuel 16:16</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-33.htm">1 Chronicles 27:33</a>, Hushai was &#1512;&#1506;&#1492;, a friend of David, i.e., one of his privy councillors. &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497; (the Archite), if we may judge from Jos 16:2, was the name of a family whose possessions were upon the southern boundary of the tribe of Ephraim, between Bethel and Ataroth. Hushai was probably a very old man, as David said to him (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-33.htm">2 Samuel 15:33</a>, <a href="/2_samuel/15-34.htm">2 Samuel 15:34</a>), "If thou goest with me, thou wilt be a burden to me. But if thou returnest to the city and offerest Absalom thy services, thou canst bring for me the counsel of Ahithophel to nought. If thou sayest to Absalom, I will be thy servant, O king; servant of thy father (i.e., as regards this) I was that of old, but now I am thy servant."
