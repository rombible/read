To-day shall the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father&#8212;Such a hope might not unnaturally arise at this period of civil distraction, that the family of David would destroy themselves by their mutual broils, and the people reinstate the old dynasty. There was an air of plausibility in Ziba's story. Many, on whom the king had conferred favors, were now deserting him. No wonder, therefore, that in the excitement of momentary feeling, believing, on the report of a slanderer, Mephibosheth to be among the number, he pronounced a rash and unrighteous judgment by which a great injury was inflicted on the character and interests of a devoted friend.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Thine are all that pertained unto Mephibosheth; </span> a rash sentence, and unrighteous, to condemn a man unheard, upon the single testimony of his accuser and servant.
