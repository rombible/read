But miserable counsellors were they both. Hushai would never counsel him to do wisely. Ahithophel counselled him to do wickedly; and so did as effectually betray him, as he did, who was designedly false to him: for they that advise men to sin, certainly advise them to their hurt. After all, honesty is the best policy, and will be found so in the long run. Ahithophel gave wicked counsel to Absalom; to render himself so hateful to his father, that he would never be reconciled to him; this cursed policy was of the devil. How desperately wicked is the human heart!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Taking possession of the harem was the most decided act of sovereignty (see <a href="/1_kings/2-22.htm">1 Kings 2:22</a>). It was also the greatest offence and insult that could be offered. Such an act on Absalom's part made reconciliation impossible. A further motive has been found in this advice, namely, the desire on the part of Ahithophel to make David taste the bitterness of that cup which he had caused others (Uriah and all Bath-sheba's family) to drink, and receive the measure which he had meted withal. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21. Ahithophel said unto Absalom&#8212;This councillor saw that now the die was cast; half measures would be inexpedient. To cut off all possibility of reconciliation between the king and his rebellious son, he gave this atrocious advice regarding the treatment of the royal women who had been left in charge of the palace. Women, being held sacred, are generally left inviolate in the casualties of war. The history of the East affords only one parallel to this infamous outrage of Absalom.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Was as if a man had inquired at the oracle of God; </span> it was received by the people with equal authority and veneration, and was usually attended with as certain success; which is mentioned as the reason why a counsel which had so ill a face, should meet with such general approbation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">With David; </span> to whose pious disposition he accommodated himself, as policy obliged him; but being weary of it, he takes this first occasion to discover himself, and execute that wickedness which before lay in his heart. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/16.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he had counselled in those days,....

He ought to have had more respect for his father than to offer him so grievous an insult, and aggravate by so terrible a deed the quarrel between them. But his conduct from first to last was utterly mean and selfish, and his only excuse here is that there was such a glamour round Ahithophel, that men yielded up their own judgment to him without an effort, and did what he advised as if it had a religious sanction. <span class="cmt_word">At the oracle of God;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">had asked the Word of God</span>; that is, had consulted God by Urim and Thummim.

But Hushai replied, "No; but whom Jehovah hath chosen, and this people (i.e., the people who had entered Jerusalem with Absalom), and all the men of Israel (i.e., the whole nation), to him (&#1500;&#1488; for &#1500;&#1493;, Keri) will I belong, and will remain with him. And again, whom should I serve? Is it not before his son? As I have served thy father, so will I be before thee" (i.e., serve thee). With great craftiness, Hushai declared at the very outset that Jehovah had chosen Absalom - at least he could not come to any other conclusion, judging from the results. And under such circumstances he could not have any doubt as to whom it was his duty to serve. As he had formerly served the father, so now he would serve his son Absalom. In this way he succeeded in completely deceiving Absalom, so that he placed unbounded confidence in him. </body></html>
