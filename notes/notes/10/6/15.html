Christ is indeed a Stone of stumbling, and a Rock of offence, to those that are disobedient; but to those that believe, he is a Corner-stone, elect, precious, 1Pe 2:6-8. Let us be religious. Is the ark a blessing to others' houses? We may have it, and the blessing of it, without fetching it away from our neighbours. David, at first setting out, offered sacrifices to God. We are likely to speed in our enterprises, when we begin with God, and give diligence to seek peace with him. And we are so unworthy, and our services are so defiled, that all our joy in God must be connected with repentance and faith in the Redeemer's atoning blood. David attended with high expressions of joy. We ought to serve God with our whole body and soul, and with every endowment and power we possess. On this occasion David laid aside his royal robes, and put on a plain linen dress. David prayed with and for the people, and as a prophet, solemnly blessed them in the name of the Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Danced - The Hebrew word is found only here and in <a href="/2_samuel/6-16.htm">2 Samuel 6:16</a>. It means "to dance in a circle," hence, simply to dance.

But it was unquestionably done as an act of religious homage, his attitudes and dress being symbolic, as they have always been in Oriental countries, of penitence, joy, thankfulness, and devotion.

If merely touching the ark of God is punished in this way, how can I have it brought near me, up to the citadel of Zion? He therefore relinquished his intention of bringing it into the city of David, and placed it in the house of Obed-edom the Gathite. Obed-edom was a Levite of the family of the Korahites, who sprang from Kohath (compare <a href="/exodus/6-21.htm">Exodus 6:21</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/18-16.htm">Exodus 18:16</a>, and <a href="/1_chronicles/26-4.htm">1 Chronicles 26:4</a>), and belonged to the class of Levitical doorkeepers, whose duty it was, in connection with other Levites, to watch over the ark in the sacred tent (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-18.htm">1 Chronicles 15:18</a>, <a href="/1_chronicles/15-24.htm">1 Chronicles 15:24</a>). He is called the Gittite or Gathite from his birthplace, the Levitical city of Gath-rimmon in the tribe of Dan (<a href="/joshua/21-24.htm">Joshua 21:24</a>; <a href="/joshua/19-45.htm">Joshua 19:45</a>). </body></html>
