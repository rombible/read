Obed-edom knew what slaughter the ark had made among the Philistines and the Bethshemites; he saw Uzzah struck dead; yet invites it to his house, and opens his doors without fear, knowing it was a savour of death only to them that treated it ill. “O the courage,” says Bishop Hall, “of an honest and faithful heart!

God saw presumption and irreverence in Uzzah's heart. Familiarity, even with that which is most awful, is apt to breed contempt. If it were so great a crime for one to lay hold on the ark of the covenant who had no right to do so, what is it for those to lay claim to the privileges of the covenant that come not up to the terms of it? Obed-edom opened his doors without fear, knowing the ark was a savour of death unto death to those only who treated it wrong. The same hand that punished Uzzah's proud presumption, rewarded Obed-edom's humble boldness. Let none think the worse of the gospel for the judgments on those that reject it, but consider the blessings it brings to all who receive it. Let masters of families be encouraged to keep up religion in their families. It is good to live in a family that entertains the ark, for all about it will fare the better.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Obed-edom was a Levite of the family of Merari, being <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-18.htm">1 Chronicles 15:18-24</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/16-38.htm">1 Chronicles 16:38</a> a son of Jeduthun, who was a Merarite.

The site of Gath-rimmon is not determined, but it seems to have been further from Jerusalem than Kirjath-jearim, and this appears to indicate either that Obed-edom had removed from his native place and was living near Jerusalem, or that “Perez-uzzah” was not far from Kirjath-jearim, and that the special fitness of Obed-edom to take charge of the Ark induced David to take it to his house, though at a greater distance from Jerusalem.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The name Obed-edom (= <span class="ital">servant of Edom</span>) is peculiar.

And as it is there said that "God blessed him," he probably it was into whose house the ark was taken. He is called a Gittite, because he belonged to Gath-Rimmon, a Levitical city in the tribe of Dan (<a href="/joshua/19-45.htm">Joshua 19:45</a>; <a href="/joshua/21-24.htm">Joshua 21:24</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"They set the ark of God upon a new cart, and took it away from the house of Abinadab." &#1492;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1489; means here "to put (load) upon a cart," and &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488; dn to take away, i.e., drive off: for there are grammatical (or syntactical) reasons which make it impossible to render &#1493;&#1497;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; as a pluperfect ("they had taken"), on account of the previous &#1493;&#1497;&#1512;&#1499;&#1489;&#1493;.<p>The ark of the covenant had been standing in the house of Abinadab from the time when the Philistines had sent it back into the land of Israel, i.e., about seventy years (viz., twenty years to the victory at Ebenezer mentioned in <a href="/1_samuel/7-1.htm">1 Samuel 7:1</a>., forty years under Samuel and Saul, and about ten years under David: see the chronological table). The further statement, that "Uzzah and Ahio, sons of Abinadab, drove the cart," may easily be reconciled with this. These two sons were either born about the time when the ark was first taken to Abinadab's house, or at a subsequent period; or else the term sons is used, as is frequently the case, in the sense of grandsons. The words from &#1495;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; (the last word in <a href="/2_samuel/6-3.htm">2 Samuel 6:3</a>) to Gibeah in <a href="/2_samuel/6-4.htm">2 Samuel 6:4</a> are wanting in the Septuagint, and can only have been introduced through the error of a copyist, whose eye wandered back to the first &#1506;&#1490;&#1500;&#1492; in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-3.htm">2 Samuel 6:3</a>, so that he copied a whole line twice over; for they not only contain a pure tautology, a merely verbal and altogether superfluous and purposeless repetition, but they are altogether unsuitable to the connection in which they stand. Not only is there something very strange in the repetition of the &#1495;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; without an article after &#1492;&#1506;&#1490;&#1500;&#1492;; but the words which follow, &#1488;&#1512;&#1493;&#1503; &#1492; &#1506;&#1501; (with the ark of God), cannot be made to fit on to the repeated clause, for there is no sense whatever in such a sentence as this: "They brought it (the ark) out of the house of Abinadab, which is upon the hill, with the ark of God." The only way in which the words "with the ark" can be made to acquire any meaning at all, is by omitting the repetition referred to, and connecting them with the new cart in <a href="/2_samuel/6-3.htm">2 Samuel 6:3</a> : "Uzzah and Ahio ... drove the cart with the ark of God, and Ahio went before the ark." &#1504;&#1492;&#1490;, to drive (a carriage), is construed here with an accusative, in <a href="/1_chronicles/13-7.htm">1 Chronicles 13:7</a> with &#1489;&#1468;, as in <a href="/isaiah/11-6.htm">Isaiah 11:6</a>.</body></html>
