In Saul’s time the ark had been neglected, and true religion was uncared for. Michal, therefore, who had fallen in love with David as a brave hero, could not understand the religious enthusiasm which led him to rank himself among the common people before the Lord.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/2_samuel/6.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/2_samuel/6-16.htm" title="And as the ark of the LORD came into the city of David, Michal Saul's daughter looked through a window, and saw king David leaping and dancing before the LORD; and she despised him in her heart.">2 Samuel 6:16</a></span>. <span class="ital">She despised him in her heart — </span>Imagining that he debased himself by stripping himself of the ornaments of majesty, and dancing among the common people.

Christ is indeed a Stone of stumbling, and a Rock of offence, to those that are disobedient; but to those that believe, he is a Corner-stone, elect, precious, 1Pe 2:6-8. Let us be religious. Is the ark a blessing to others' houses? We may have it, and the blessing of it, without fetching it away from our neighbours. David, at first setting out, offered sacrifices to God. We are likely to speed in our enterprises, when we begin with God, and give diligence to seek peace with him. And we are so unworthy, and our services are so defiled, that all our joy in God must be connected with repentance and faith in the Redeemer's atoning blood. David attended with high expressions of joy. We ought to serve God with our whole body and soul, and with every endowment and power we possess. On this occasion David laid aside his royal robes, and put on a plain linen dress. David prayed with and for the people, and as a prophet, solemnly blessed them in the name of the Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>She despised him in her heart - In the days of Saul the ark had been neglected <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/13-3.htm">1 Chronicles 13:3</a>, and Saul had in everything shown himself to be an irreligious king.

She is said to be Saul's daughter, though David's wife, as having a good deal of her father's haughty temper and disposition, as appears by what follows: <p>and saw King David leaping and dancing before the Lord; the ark of the Lord, by these outward gestures expressing the inward joy of his heart on this occasion: <p>and she despised him in her heart; as acting a mean part, quite beneath himself, and unbecoming his royal dignity. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_samuel/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And as the ark of the LORD came into the city of David, Michal Saul's daughter looked through a window, and saw king David leaping and dancing before the LORD; and she <span class="cverse3">{h}</span> despised him in her heart.</span><p>(h) The worldlings are not able to comprehend the emotions that move the children of God to praise God in all kinds of ways.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/2_samuel/6.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">16</span>. <span class="ital">leaping and dancing</span>] Two peculiar words, the first found here only, the second only here and in <span class="ital"><a href="/2_samuel/6-14.htm" title="And David danced before the LORD with all his might; and David was girded with a linen ephod.">2 Samuel 6:14</a></span>, are used to denote the special modes of dancing anciently employed in religious solemnities.

If merely touching the ark of God is punished in this way, how can I have it brought near me, up to the citadel of Zion? He therefore relinquished his intention of bringing it into the city of David, and placed it in the house of Obed-edom the Gathite. Obed-edom was a Levite of the family of the Korahites, who sprang from Kohath (compare <a href="/exodus/6-21.htm">Exodus 6:21</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/18-16.htm">Exodus 18:16</a>, and <a href="/1_chronicles/26-4.htm">1 Chronicles 26:4</a>), and belonged to the class of Levitical doorkeepers, whose duty it was, in connection with other Levites, to watch over the ark in the sacred tent (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-18.htm">1 Chronicles 15:18</a>, <a href="/1_chronicles/15-24.htm">1 Chronicles 15:24</a>). He is called the Gittite or Gathite from his birthplace, the Levitical city of Gath-rimmon in the tribe of Dan (<a href="/joshua/21-24.htm">Joshua 21:24</a>; <a href="/joshua/19-45.htm">Joshua 19:45</a>). </body></html>
