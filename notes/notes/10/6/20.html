Now, having dismissed and blessed the people, he returns to bless those members of his household whom eastern custom had not allowed to take part in the ceremonies, and is met by Michal with her cutting irony. The account of this is omitted from the narrative in Chronicles.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/2_samuel/6.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/2_samuel/6-20.htm" title="Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How glorious was the king of Israel to day, who uncovered himself to day in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovers himself!">2 Samuel 6:20</a></span>. <span class="ital">David returned to bless his household </span>— As he had done his people. Ministers must not think that their public performances will excuse them from family worship; but when they have blessed the public assembly they are to return and bless their own household. And none is too great to do this. It is the work of angels to worship God; and therefore certainly can be no disparagement to the greatest of men. <span class="ital">How glorious was the king of Israel! — </span>This she spoke ironically, by way of derision and contempt. <span class="ital">Who uncovered himself to-day — </span>Stripped himself of his royal robe, and put on a linen ephod. “The original word, <span class="greekheb">נגלה</span>, <span class="ital">niglah, </span>which we render <span class="ital">uncovering himself, </span>doth not mean exposing any part of the body to view, and is never used in that sense, without some other word to determine it to that meaning. And as in the parallel place (<a href="/1_chronicles/15-29.htm" title="And it came to pass, as the ark of the covenant of the LORD came to the city of David, that Michal, the daughter of Saul looking out at a window saw king David dancing and playing: and she despised him in her heart.">1 Chronicles 15:29</a>) this circumstance is not at all taken notice of, but only that when she saw David dancing and leaping, (or, as the word should be rendered, playing on some musical instrument, as it is used, <a href="/2_samuel/6-5.htm" title="And David and all the house of Israel played before the LORD on all manner of instruments made of fir wood, even on harps, and on psalteries, and on tambourines, and on cornets, and on cymbals.">2 Samuel 6:5</a>,) <span class="ital">she despised him; </span>the meaning can be nothing more than that by dancing before the ark without his royal habit, (exchanged for the linen ephods) and playing on his harp, or some musical instrument, like the rest of the people, he appeared (that is, exposed himself in her eyes) <span class="ital">as one of the vain fellows</span>.” — Dodd. <span class="ital">In the eyes of the handmaids of his servants — </span>The women probably bore a part in this procession and solemnity, as they did Exodus 15., or, at least, were spectators of it; from which, indeed, none were excluded, though ever so mean. <span class="ital">As one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself — </span>Throws off his clothes, and cares not who sees him. The word <span class="ital">shamelessly</span> is not in the original, but injudiciously inserted by our translators, who have themselves put a better word, namely, <span class="ital">openly, </span>in the margin. The Hebrew words <span class="greekheb">כנגלות נגלות</span>, <span class="ital">cheniggaloth nigloth, </span>literally translated, are, <span class="ital">as in uncovering he uncovereth. </span>Michal doubtless spoke this by way of reproach, of his putting off his proper royal apparel, and mixing with the multitude. If she meant to intimate that he had exposed himself immodestly, she aggravated his action in a fit of passion; for it is not at all credible that he should do any thing of the kind. There can be no doubt but he kept himself within the bounds of modesty and decency, especially as he was employed in sacred work. He was acting according to the command of God, who required the Israelites to rejoice in their feasts, <a href="/deuteronomy/12-7.htm" title="And there you shall eat before the LORD your God, and you shall rejoice in all that you put your hand to, you and your households, wherein the LORD your God has blessed you.">Deuteronomy 12:7</a>; and <a href="/deuteronomy/16-14.htm" title="And you shall rejoice in your feast, you, and your son, and your daughter, and your manservant, and your maidservant, and the Levite, the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that are within your gates.">Deuteronomy 16:14</a>; but certainly not with a trifling, lascivious, and petulant mirth, but with a pious, holy, and moderate joy, becoming the presence of God. But as Michal judged of David, so do carnal and worldly-minded men judge of true piety, and of those who make a profession of it. It is all weakness and meanness of spirit, or it is enthusiasm and extravagance in their eyes. But David’s reply to Michal may teach us not to be ashamed of religion, or of any part of it, whatever reproach may be cast upon us for it. The erroneous judgment and sneers of ungodly men should be despised and disregarded when the honour of God is in question.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:20-23 David returned to bless his household, to pray with them, and for them, and to offer up family thanksgiving for this national mercy. It is angels' work to worship God, surely that cannot lower the greatest of men. But even the palaces of princes are not free from family troubles. Exercises of religion appear mean in the eyes of those who have little or no religion themselves. If we can approve ourselves to God in what we do in religion, and do it as before the Lord, we need not heed reproach. Piety will have its praise: let us not be indifferent in it, nor afraid or ashamed to own it. David was contented to justify himself, and he did not further reprove or blame Michal's insolence; but God punished her. Those that honour God, he will honour; but those that despise him, and his servants and service, shall be lightly esteemed.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Then David returned ... - He had passed his house to accompany the ark to the tabernacle he had pitched for it, when Michal saw him dancing.

Doubtless there also a joyful feast would be prepared, and all be gathered together to praise God and rejoice with one con sent. <span class="cmt_word">Who uncovered himself ... as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself!</span> David's offence in the eyes of Michal was, not his dancing, but his divesting himself of his royal robes, and appearing before his subjects clad in the dress of an inferior class. The Levites were to occupy a humble social position (see <a href="/deuteronomy/14-29.htm">Deuteronomy 14:29</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/26-12.htm">Deuteronomy 26:12</a>), and Michal's words are a proof that such was in David's time the case. The language of Michal is that of a woman vexed and irritated. After reminding David of his high office as "King of Israel," she reproaches him for appearing on a grand public occasion without the upper and becoming robe in which an Oriental enwraps himself. And this he had done before the female slaves of his own servants, with no more self-respect than that shown by the "vain fellows." "Vain" is the "raca" of <a href="/matthew/5-22.htm">Matthew 5:22</a>, and means "empty," void of virtue, void of reputation, and void of worldly means. The Hebrews, when expressing the greatest possible contempt for a man, called him an "empty," and no word could be found better conveying the meaning of thorough worthlessness. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"And David danced with all his might before the Lord (i.e., before the ark), and was girded with a white ephod (shoulder-dress)." Dancing, as an expression of holy enthusiasm, was a customary thing from time immemorial: we meet with it as early as at the festival of thanksgiving at the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/15-20.htm">Exodus 15:20</a>); but there, and also at subsequent celebrations of the different victories gained by the Israelites, none but women are described as taking part in it (<a href="/judges/11-34.htm">Judges 11:34</a>; <a href="/judges/21-19.htm">Judges 21:19</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/18-6.htm">1 Samuel 18:6</a>). The white ephod was, strictly speaking, a priestly costume, although in the law it is not prescribed as the dress to be worn by them when performing their official duties, but rather as the dress which denoted the priestly character of the wearer (see at <a href="/1_samuel/22-18.htm">1 Samuel 22:18</a>); and for this reason it was worn by David in connection with these festivities in honour of the Lord, as the head of the priestly nation of Israel (see at <a href="/1_samuel/2-18.htm">1 Samuel 2:18</a>). In <a href="/2_samuel/6-15.htm">2 Samuel 6:15</a> it is still further related, that David and all the house (nation) of Israel brought up the ark of the Lord with jubilee and trumpet-blast. &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492; is used here to signify the song of jubilee and the joyous shouting of the people. In the Chronicles (<a href="/1_chronicles/15-28.htm">1 Chronicles 15:28</a>) the musical instruments played on the occasion are also severally mentioned. </body></html>
