God saw presumption and irreverence in Uzzah's heart. Familiarity, even with that which is most awful, is apt to breed contempt. If it were so great a crime for one to lay hold on the ark of the covenant who had no right to do so, what is it for those to lay claim to the privileges of the covenant that come not up to the terms of it? Obed-edom opened his doors without fear, knowing the ark was a savour of death unto death to those only who treated it wrong. The same hand that punished Uzzah's proud presumption, rewarded Obed-edom's humble boldness. Let none think the worse of the gospel for the judgments on those that reject it, but consider the blessings it brings to all who receive it. Let masters of families be encouraged to keep up religion in their families. It is good to live in a family that entertains the ark, for all about it will fare the better.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Displeased - Grief allied to anger seems to be intended.

Uzzah Smitten.<p>6-8. they came to Nachon's threshing-floor&#8212;or Chidon's (1Ch 13:9). The Chaldee version renders the words, "came to the place prepared for the reception of the ark," that is, near the city of David (2Sa 6:13).<p>the oxen shook it&#8212;or, "stumbled" (1Ch 13:9). Fearing that the ark was in danger of being overturned, Uzzah, under the impulse of momentary feeling, laid hold of it to keep it steady. Whether it fell and crushed him, or some sudden disease attacked him, he fell dead upon the spot. This melancholy occurrence not only threw a cloud over the joyous scene, but entirely stopped the procession; for the ark was left where it then was, in the near neighborhood of the capital. It is of importance to observe the proportionate severity of the punishments attending the profanation of the ark. The Philistines suffered by diseases, from which they were relieved by their oblations, because the law had not been given to them [1Sa 5:8-12]; the Bethshemites also suffered, but not fatally [1Sa 6:19]; their error proceeded from ignorance or inadvertency. But Uzzah, who was a Levite, and well instructed, suffered death for his breach of the law. The severity of Uzzah's fate may seem to us too great for the nature and degree of the offense. But it does not become us to sit in judgment on the dispensations of God; and, besides, it is apparent that the divine purpose was to inspire awe of His majesty, a submission to His law, and a profound veneration for the symbols and ordinances of His worship.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">David was displeased, </span> or, <span class="ital">grieved</span>, both for the sin, which he acknowledgeth, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/1_chronicles/15-2.htm" title="Then David said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites: for them has the LORD chosen to carry the ark of God, and to minister to him for ever.">1 Chronicles 15:2</a>,13</span>, and for God’s heavy judgment; whereby their hopes were dashed, and their joys interrupted, and a good subject struck dead for the circumstantial error of a pious mind, which he might possibly think harsh and very severe, and therefore be displeased or offended at this sharp providence. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And David was displeased, because the Lord had made a breach upon Uzzah,....

Uzzah's death was probably caused by apoplexy, and the sudden effort of stretching forth his hand and seizing the ark had been its immediate cause. So tragic an event spoiled the happiness of the day, filled all present with disappointment, made them break off in haste from the grand ceremonial, and placed David before his subjects in the position of a malefactor. He had prepared a great religious festival, and Jehovah had broken in upon them as an enemy. In his first burst of displeasure he called the place Perez-Uzzah, the word "Perez," or "Breach," conveying to the Hebrews the idea of a great calamity (<a href="/judges/21-15.htm">Judges 21:15</a>) or of a sudden attack upon a foe (<a href="/2_samuel/5-20.htm">2 Samuel 5:20</a>). The historian adds that the place bore this name unto his day; but we cannot tell whether these are the words of the original compiler of the Book of Samuel, or, as is more probably the case, those of some subsequent editor or scribe. Many such remarks are supposed to have been inserted by Ezra and the men of the great synagogue.  <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"David went with all the people that were with him to Baale-Jehuda, to fetch up the ark of God from thence." The words &#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1492; &#1502;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;cause some difficulty on account of the &#1502;&#1503;, which is used instead of the accusative with &#1492; loc., like &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1514;&#1492; in the Chronicles; yet the translators of the Septuagint, Chaldee, Vulgate, and other versions, all had the reading &#1502;&#1503; in their text, and &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1497; has therefore been taken as an appellative and rendered &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x399;&#787;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#769; ("from the rulers of Judah"), or as Luther renders it, "from the citizens of Judah." This is decidedly incorrect, as the word "thence" which follows is perfectly unintelligible on any other supposition than that Baale-Jehudah is the name of a place. Baale-Jehudah is another name of the city of Kirjath-jearim (<a href="/joshua/15-60.htm">Joshua 15:60</a>; <a href="/joshua/18-14.htm">Joshua 18:14</a>), which is called Baalah in <a href="/joshua/15-9.htm">Joshua 15:9</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/13-6.htm">1 Chronicles 13:6</a>, according to its Canaanitish name, instead of which the name Kirjath-jearim (city of the woods) was adopted by the Israelites, though without entirely supplanting the old name. The epithet "of Judah" is a contraction of the fuller expression "city of the children of Judah" in <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/18-14.htm">Joshua 18:14</a>, and is added to distinguish this Baal city, which was situated upon the border of the tribe of Judah, from other cities that were also named after Baal, such as Baal or Baalath-beer in the tribe of Simeon (<a href="/1_chronicles/4-33.htm">1 Chronicles 4:33</a>; <a href="/joshua/19-8.htm">Joshua 19:8</a>), Baalath in the tribe of Dan (<a href="/joshua/19-44.htm">Joshua 19:44</a>), the present Kuryet el Enab (see at <a href="/joshua/9-17.htm">Joshua 9:17</a>). The &#1502;&#1503; (from) is either a very ancient error of the pen that crept by accident into the text, or, if genuine and original, it is to be explained on the supposition that the historian dropped the construction with which he started, and instead of mentioning Baale-Jehudah as the place to which David went, gave it at once as the place from which he fetched the ark; so that the passage is to be understood in this way: "And David went, and all the people who were with him, out of Baale-Jehudah, to which they had gone up to fetch the ark of God" (Kimchi). In the sentence which follows, a difficulty is also occasioned by the repetition of the word &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; in the clause &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; ... &#1504;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488; &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, "upon which the name is called, the name of Jehovah of hosts, who is enthroned above the cherubim." The difficulty cannot be solved by altering the first &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; into &#1513;&#1473;&#1501;, as Clericus, Thenius, and Bertheau suggest: for if this alteration were adopted, we should have to render the passage "where the name of Jehovah of hosts is invoked, who is enthroned above the cherubim (which are) upon it (i.e., upon the ark);" and this would not only introduce an unscriptural thought into the passage, but it would be impossible to find any suitable meaning for the word &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;, except by making very arbitrary interpolations. Throughout the whole of the Old Testament we never meet with the idea that the name of Jehovah was invoked at the ark of the covenant, because no one was allowed to approach the ark for the purpose of invoking the name of the Lord there; and upon the great day of atonement the high priest was only allowed to enter the most holy place with the cloud of incense, to sprinkle the blood of the atoning sacrifice upon the ark. Moreover, the standing expression for "call upon the name of the Lord" is &#1497;&#1497; &#1489;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501; &#1511;&#1512;&#1488;; whereas &#1508;&#1468; &#1506;&#1500; &#1497;&#1497; &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; &#1504;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488; signifies "the name of Jehovah is called above a person or thing." Lastly, even if &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; belonged to &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;, it would not only be a superfluous addition, occurring nowhere else in connection with &#1492;&#1498; &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;, not even in <a href="/1_chronicles/13-6.htm">1 Chronicles 13:6</a> (vid., <a href="/1_samuel/4-4.htm">1 Samuel 4:4</a>; <a href="/2_kings/19-15.htm">2 Kings 19:15</a>; <a href="/isaiah/37-16.htm">Isaiah 37:16</a>; <a href="/psalms/99-1.htm">Psalm 99:1</a>), but such an addition if made at all would necessarily require &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1506; (vid., <a href="/exodus/25-22.htm">Exodus 25:22</a>). The only way in which we can obtain a biblical thought and grammatical sense is by connecting &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; with the &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; before &#1504;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488;: "above which (ark) the name of Jehovah-Zebaoth is named," i.e., above which Jehovah reveals His glory or His divine nature to His people, or manifests His gracious presence in Israel. "The name of God denotes all the operations of God through which He attests His personal presence in that relation into which He has entered to man, i.e., the whole of the divine self-manifestation, or of that side of the divine nature which is turned towards men" (Oehler, Herzog's Real-Encycl. x. p. 197). From this deeper meaning of "the name of God" we may probably explain the repetition of the word &#1513;&#1473;&#1501;, which is first of all written absolutely (as at the close of <a href="/leviticus/24-16.htm">Leviticus 24:16</a>), and then more fully defined as "the name of the Lord of hosts."</body></html>
