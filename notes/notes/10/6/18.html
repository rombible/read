Christ is indeed a Stone of stumbling, and a Rock of offence, to those that are disobedient; but to those that believe, he is a Corner-stone, elect, precious, 1Pe 2:6-8. Let us be religious. Is the ark a blessing to others' houses? We may have it, and the blessing of it, without fetching it away from our neighbours. David, at first setting out, offered sacrifices to God. We are likely to speed in our enterprises, when we begin with God, and give diligence to seek peace with him. And we are so unworthy, and our services are so defiled, that all our joy in God must be connected with repentance and faith in the Redeemer's atoning blood. David attended with high expressions of joy. We ought to serve God with our whole body and soul, and with every endowment and power we possess. On this occasion David laid aside his royal robes, and put on a plain linen dress. David prayed with and for the people, and as a prophet, solemnly blessed them in the name of the Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He blessed the people - So did Solomon <a href="/1_kings/8-14.htm">1 Kings 8:14</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18. he blessed the people&#8212;in the double character of prophet and king (see 1Ki 8:55, 56).

But this did not deprive the king, who was Jehovah's anointed representative, of the right of also blessing them, and Solomon, at the consecration of the temple, followed his father's example in a very solemn manner (<a href="/2_chronicles/6-3.htm">2 Chronicles 6:3</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Removal of the ark of God to the city of David (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15.htm">1 Chronicles 15</a>). - <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-11.htm">2 Samuel 6:11</a>, <a href="/2_samuel/6-12.htm">2 Samuel 6:12</a>. When the ark had been in the house of Obed-edom for three months, and David heard that the Lord had blessed his house for the sake of the ark of God, he went thither and brought it up to the city of David with gladness i.e., with festal rejoicing, or a solemn procession. (For &#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1492;&#1492;, in the sense of festal rejoicing, or a joyous fte, see <a href="/genesis/31-27.htm">Genesis 31:27</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-43.htm">Nehemiah 12:43</a>, etc.) On this occasion, however, David adhered strictly to the instructions of the law, as the more elaborate account given in the Chronicles clearly shows. He not only gathered together all Israel at Jerusalem to join in this solemn act, but summoned the priests and Levites, and commanded them to sanctify themselves, and carry the ark "according to the right," i.e., as the Lord had commanded in the law of Moses, and to offer sacrifices during the procession, and sin songs, i.e., psalms, with musical accompaniment. In the very condensed account before us, all that is mentioned is the carrying of the ark, the sacrificing during the march, and the festivities of the king and people. But even from these few facts we see that David had discovered his former mistake, and had given up the idea of removing the ark upon a carriage as a transgression of the law. </body></html>
