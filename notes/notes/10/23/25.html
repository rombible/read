It seems to be an instance of weakness. He was thirsty; with the water of that well he had often refreshed himself when a youth, and it was without due thought that he desired it. Were his valiant men so forward to expose themselves, upon the least hint of their prince's mind, and so eager to please him, and shall not we long to approve ourselves to our Lord Jesus, by ready compliance with his will, as shown us by his word, Spirit, and providence? But David poured out the water as a drink-offering to the Lord. Thus he would cross his own foolish fancy, and punish himself for indulging it, and show that he had sober thoughts to correct his rash ones, and knew how to deny himself. Did David look upon that water as very precious which was got at the hazard of these men's blood, and shall not we much more value those benefits for purchasing which our blessed Saviour shed his blood? Let all beware of neglecting so great salvation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>etc. The early death of Asahel <a href="/2_samuel/2-32.htm">2 Samuel 2:32</a> would make it very likely that his place in the 30 would be filled up, and so easily account for the number 31 in the list.

There are thirty-one mentioned in the list, including Asahel; and these added to the two superior orders make thirty-seven. Two of them, we know, were already dead; namely, Asahel [2Sa 3:30] and Uriah [2Sa 11:17]; and if the dead, at the drawing up of the list, amounted to seven, then we might suppose a legion of honor, consisting of the definite number thirty, where the vacancies, when they occurred, were replaced by fresh appointments.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/23.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> In <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/1_chronicles/11-27.htm" title="Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite,">1 Chronicles 11:27</a></span>, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Shammoth the Harorite; </span> concerning which and such-like alterations, and other changes of the names, which will be observed by comparing this catalogue with that, it will be sufficient to suggest, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.
