Yet, on the other hand, David would not suffer his own longing to be gratified by the hazard of men’s lives. Taking the water, therefore, he “poured it out unto the Lord.” The word is the technical term for the sacrificial libation, and David assimilated his act to a sacrifice by a solemn consecration of this dangerously won water to the Lord.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/23.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>23:8-39 David once earnestly longed for the water at the well of Bethlehem. It seems to be an instance of weakness. He was thirsty; with the water of that well he had often refreshed himself when a youth, and it was without due thought that he desired it. Were his valiant men so forward to expose themselves, upon the least hint of their prince's mind, and so eager to please him, and shall not we long to approve ourselves to our Lord Jesus, by ready compliance with his will, as shown us by his word, Spirit, and providence? But David poured out the water as a drink-offering to the Lord. Thus he would cross his own foolish fancy, and punish himself for indulging it, and show that he had sober thoughts to correct his rash ones, and knew how to deny himself. Did David look upon that water as very precious which was got at the hazard of these men's blood, and shall not we much more value those benefits for purchasing which our blessed Saviour shed his blood?

Dr. Robinson doubts the identity of the well; but others think that there are no good grounds for doing so. Certainly, considering this to be the ancient well, Beth-lehem must have once extended ten minutes further to the north, and must have lain in times of old, not as now, on the summit, but on the northern rise of the hill; for the well is by or (1Ch 11:7) at the gate. I find in the description of travellers, that the common opinion is, that David's captains had come from the southeast, in order to obtain, at the risk of their lives, the so-much-longed-for water; while it is supposed that David himself was then in the great cave that is not far to the southeast of Beth-lehem; which cave is generally held to have been that of Adullam. But (Jos 15:35) Adullam lay "in the valley"; that is, in the undulating plain at the western base of the mountains of Judea and consequently to the southwest of Beth-lehem. Be this as it may, David's men had in any case to break through the host of the Philistines, in order to reach the well; and the position of Bir-Daoud agrees well with this [Van De Velde].<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/23.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The host of the Philistines</span> was in the valley of Rephaim, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/2_samuel/23-13.htm" title="And three of the thirty chief went down, and came to David in the harvest time to the cave of Adullam: and the troop of the Philistines pitched in the valley of Rephaim.">2 Samuel 23:13</a></span>, and in the way to Beth-lehem. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">He would not drink thereof; </span> lest by gratifying himself upon such terms, he should seem either to set too high a price upon the satisfaction of his appetite, or too low a price upon the lives of his soldiers, or should encourage others to the like vain-glorious and foolish attempts. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Poured it out unto the Lord, </span> as a kind of drink-offering, and acknowledgment of God’s goodness in preserving the lives of his captains in so dangerous an enterprise; and to show that he esteemed it as a sacred thing, which, considering all things, it was not fit for him to drink it. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/23.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the three mighty men brake through the host of the Philistines,....

Gersom thinks it was now the feast of tabernacles, which was the feast of ingathering the fruits of the earth, when great quantities of water were drawn and poured out at the altar, which was done to obtain the blessing of the former rain; See Gill on <a href="/john/7-37.htm">John 7:37</a> and See Gill on <a href="/john/7-38.htm">John 7:38</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_samuel/23.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the three mighty men brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that <i>was</i> by the gate, and took <i>it</i>, and brought <i>it</i> to David: nevertheless he would not drink thereof, but <span class="cverse3">{k}</span> poured it out unto the LORD.</span><p>(k) Bridling his affection, and also desiring God not to be offended for that rash enterprise.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/2_samuel/23.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">16</span>. <span class="ital">brake through the host of the Philistines</span>] A striking proof of the enthusiasm which David inspired in his followers, and a noble instance of the true spirit of chivalry, which fears no danger and shrinks from no self-sacrifice, in order to do the smallest service for the object of its devotion; the spirit which is perfected in the highest example of love (<a href="/john/15-13.htm" title="Greater love has no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.">John 15:13</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">poured it out unto the</span> Lord] The sacrificial term for pouring out a drink-offering or libation (<a href="/genesis/35-14.htm" title="And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him, even a pillar of stone: and he poured a drink offering thereon, and he poured oil thereon.">Genesis 35:14</a>, &c.). “That which had been won by the lives of those three gallant chiefs was too sacred for him to drink, but it was on that very account deemed by him as worthy to be consecrated in sacrifice to God, as any of the prescribed offerings of the Levitical ritual.

The valley of Rephaim, in fact, extended from Jerusalem  to Bethlehem, and, to guard their position, the Philistines held Bethlehem with a strong garrison. Of course the heroes would use every precaution; for to be discovered would be certain death. The story of their perils and presence of mind in danger, and hairbreadth escape, would be full of interest; but we are told only that they succeeded, and returned in safety, bearing their precious burden; but David would not drink, <span class="cmt_word">and poured it out unto Jehovah.</span> The word is that used of a sacrificial libation; for David regarded it as holy, and consecrated to God, because it had been bought with blood - at the risk, that is, of the lives of these gallant men. Nothing is recorded in the romances of the Middle Ages, when knightly chivalry was at its height, more gallant and noble than the exploit of these men. And the very essence of its devotion lay in the fact that it was done to gratify a mere sick longing, and therefore out of pure love. Sick, no doubt, David was, and burning with fever; and even more depressed by the apparent hopelessness of his position. The exploit changed the course of his thoughts. What could he not do with such heroes! Though racked during their absence with anxiety and self-reproach, yet on their return he would be dispirited no longer, but filled with confidence. The words, "Shall I drink?" inserted in the Revised Version, have apparently dropped out of the text by accident. They are found in the parallel place in Chronicles, and in the Septuagint and Vulgate here. The Syriac has, "At the peril of their life's blood these men went." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/23.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"After him (i.e., next to him in rank) was Eleazar the son of Dodai the Ahohite, among the three heroes with David when they defied the Philistines, who had assembled there, and the Israelites drew near." The Chethib &#1491;&#1491;&#1497; is to be read &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1491;&#1497;, Dodai, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-4.htm">1 Chronicles 27:4</a>, and the form &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1491;&#1493; (Dodo) in the parallel text (<a href="/1_chronicles/11-12.htm">1 Chronicles 11:12</a>) is only a variation in the form of the name. Instead of &#1489;&#1468;&#1503;&#1470;&#1488;&#1495;&#1495;&#1497; (the son of Ahohi) we find &#1492;&#1506;&#1495;&#1495;&#1497; (the Ahohite) in the Chronicles; but the &#1489;&#1468;&#1503; must not be struck out on that account as spurious, for "the son of an Ahohite" is the same as "the Ahohite." For &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; we must read &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;, according to the Keri and the Chronicles. &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; is not to be altered, since the numerals are sometimes attached to substantives in the absolute state (see Ges. 120, 1). "The three heroes" are Jashobeam, Eleazar, and Shammah (<a href="/2_samuel/23-11.htm">2 Samuel 23:11</a>), who reached the first rank, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-19.htm">2 Samuel 23:19</a>, among the heroes of David. Instead of &#1489;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1512;&#1508;&#1501; (when they defied the Philistines), we find in the Chronicles &#1493;&#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1505;, "at Pas-dammim," i.e., most probably Ephes-dammim (<a href="/1_samuel/17-1.htm">1 Samuel 17:1</a>), where the Philistines were encamped when Goliath defied the Israelites. Thenius, Bertheau, and Bttcher therefore propose to alter our text so as to make it correspond to that of the Chronicles, and adduce as the reason the fact that in other passages &#1495;&#1512;&#1507; is construed with the accusative, and that &#1513;&#1473;&#1501;, which follows, presupposes the previous mention of the place referred to. But the reasons are neither of them decisive. &#1495;&#1512;&#1507; .evisiced  is not construed with the accusative alone, but also with &#1500;   (<a href="/2_chronicles/32-17.htm">2 Chronicles 32:17</a>), so that the construction with &#1489; is quite a possible one, and is not at variance with the idea of the word. &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; again may also be understood as referring to the place, not named, where the Philistines fought with the Israelites. The omission of &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; before &#1504;&#1506;&#1505;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468; is more difficult to explain; and &#1493;&#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, which we find in the Chronicles, has probably dropped out after &#1489;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;. The reading in the Chronicles &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1505; (&#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1508;&#1505;) is probably only a more exact description of the locality, which is but obscurely indicated in our text by &#1489;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1512;&#1508;&#1501;; for these words affirm that the battle took place where the Israelites had once been defied by the Philistines (<a href="/1_samuel/17-10.htm">1 Samuel 17:10</a>), and where they repaid them for this defiance in a subsequent conflict. The Philistines are at any rate to be regarded as the subject to &#1504;&#1506;&#1505;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468;, and these words are a circumstantial clause: the Philistines had assembled together there to battle, and the Israelites had advanced to the attack. The heroic act of Eleazar is introduced with "he arose." He arose and smote the Philistines till his hand was weary and clave to his sword, i.e., was so cramped as to be stiffened to the sword. Through this Jehovah wrought a great salvation for Israel on that day, "and the people (the soldiers) turned after him only to plunder," sc., because he had put the enemy to flight by himself. &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493; &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; does not mean to turn back from flight after him, but is the opposite of &#1502;&#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497; &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;, to turn away from a person (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-11.htm">1 Samuel 15:11</a>, etc.), so that it signifies "to turn to a person and follow behind him." Three lines have dropped out from the parallel text of the Chronicles, in consequence of the eye of a copyist having wandered from &#1504;&#1506;&#1505;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468; &#1508;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="/2_samuel/23-9.htm">2 Samuel 23:9</a> to &#1508;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1505;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468; in <a href="/2_samuel/23-11.htm">2 Samuel 23:11</a>.</body></html>
