It seems to be an instance of weakness. He was thirsty; with the water of that well he had often refreshed himself when a youth, and it was without due thought that he desired it. Were his valiant men so forward to expose themselves, upon the least hint of their prince's mind, and so eager to please him, and shall not we long to approve ourselves to our Lord Jesus, by ready compliance with his will, as shown us by his word, Spirit, and providence? But David poured out the water as a drink-offering to the Lord. Thus he would cross his own foolish fancy, and punish himself for indulging it, and show that he had sober thoughts to correct his rash ones, and knew how to deny himself. Did David look upon that water as very precious which was got at the hazard of these men's blood, and shall not we much more value those benefits for purchasing which our blessed Saviour shed his blood? Let all beware of neglecting so great salvation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Gone away - Rather, went up to battle (<a href="/2_samuel/5-19.htm">2 Samuel 5:19</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/3-21.htm">2 Kings 3:21</a>, etc.) against them.

These be the names of the mighty men whom David had&#8212;This verse should be translated thus: He who sits in the seat of the Tachmonite (that is, of Jashobeam the Hachmonite), who was chief among the captains, the same is Adino the Eznite; he lift up his spear against eight hundred, whom he slew at one time. The text is corrupt in this passage; the number eight hundred should be three hundred [Davidson, Hermeneutics]. Under Joab he was chief or president of the council of war. The first or highest order was composed of him and his two colleagues, Eleazar and Shammah. Eleazar seems to have been left to fight the Philistines alone; and on his achieving the victory, they returned to the spoil. In like manner Shammah was left to stand alone in his glory, when the Lord, by him, wrought a great victory. It is not very easy to determine whether the exploits that are afterwards described were performed by the first or the second three.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/23.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">He arose, </span> i. e. he undertook the work, as that word sometimes is used.

The idea that <a href="/2_samuel/23-4.htm">2 Samuel 23:4</a> should be connected with <a href="/2_samuel/23-3.htm">2 Samuel 23:3</a> so as to form one period, in the sense of "when one rules justly over men (as I do), it is as when a morning becomes clear," must be rejected, for the simple reason that it overlooks Nathan's promise (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7</a>) altogether, and weakens the force of the saying so solemnly introduced as the word of God. The ruler over men whom David sees in spirit, is not any one who rules righteously over men; nor is the seed of David to be regarded as a collective expression indicating a merely ideal personality, but, according to the Chaldee rendering, the Messiah himself, the righteous Shoot whom the Lord would raise up to David (<a href="/jeremiah/23-5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5</a>), and who would execute righteousness and judgment upon earth (<a href="/jeremiah/33-15.htm">Jeremiah 33:15</a>). <a href="/2_samuel/23-4.htm">2 Samuel 23:4</a> is to be taken by itself as containing an independent thought, and the connection between it and <a href="/2_samuel/23-3.htm">2 Samuel 23:3</a> must be gathered from the words themselves: the appearance (the rise) of this Ruler will be "as light of the morning, when the sun rises." At the same time, the Messiah is not to be regarded as the subject to &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512; &#1488;&#1493;&#1512; (the light of the morning), as though the ruler over men were compared with the morning light; but the subject compared to the morning light is intentionally left indefinite, according to the view adopted by Luther in his exposition, "In the time of the Messiah it will be like the light of the morning." We are precluded from regarding the Messiah as the subject, by the fact that the comparison is instituted not with the sun, but with the morning dawn at the rising of the sun, whose vivifying effects upon nature are described in the second clause of the verse. The words &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473; &#1497;&#1494;&#1512;&#1495; are to be taken relatively, as a more distinct definition of the morning light. The clause which follows, "morning without clouds," is parallel to the foregoing, and describes more fully the nature of the morning. The light of the rising sun on a cloudless morning is an image of the coming salvation. The rising sun awakens the germs of life in the bosom of nature, which had been slumbering through the darkness of the night. "The state of things before the coming of the ruler resembles the darkness of the night" (Hengstenberg). The verb is also wanting in the second hemistich. "From the shining from rain (is, comes) fresh green out of the earth." &#1504;&#1490;&#1492;&#1468; signifies the brightness of the rising sun; but, so far as the actual meaning is concerned, it relates to the salvation which attends the coming of the righteous ruler. &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1496;&#1512; is either subordinate to &#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1490;&#1492;&#1468;, or co-ordinate with it. In the former case, we should have to render the passage, "from the shining of the sun which proceeds out of rain," or "from the shining after rain;" and the allusion would be to a cloudless morning, when the shining of the sun after a night's rain stimulates the growth of the plants. In the latter case, we should have to render it "from the shining (and) from the rain;" and the reference would be to a cloudless morning, on which the vegetation springs up from the ground through sunshine followed by rain. Grammatically considered, the first view (? the second) is the easier of the two; nevertheless we regard the other (? the first) as the only admissible one, inasmuch as rain is not to be expected when the sun has risen with a cloudless sky. The rays of the sun, as it rises after a night of rain, strengthen the fresh green of the plants. The rain is therefore a figurative representation of blessing generally (cf. <a href="/isaiah/44-3.htm">Isaiah 44:3</a>), and the green grass which springs up from the earth after the rain is an image of the blessings of the Messianic salvation (<a href="/isaiah/44-4.htm">Isaiah 44:4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/45-8.htm">Isaiah 45:8</a>).<p>In <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/72-6.htm">Psalm 72:6</a>, Solomon takes these words of David as the basis of his comparison of the effects resulting from the government of the true Prince of peace to the coming down of the rain upon the mown grass.</body></html>
