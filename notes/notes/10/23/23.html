It seems to be an instance of weakness. He was thirsty; with the water of that well he had often refreshed himself when a youth, and it was without due thought that he desired it. Were his valiant men so forward to expose themselves, upon the least hint of their prince's mind, and so eager to please him, and shall not we long to approve ourselves to our Lord Jesus, by ready compliance with his will, as shown us by his word, Spirit, and providence? But David poured out the water as a drink-offering to the Lord. Thus he would cross his own foolish fancy, and punish himself for indulging it, and show that he had sober thoughts to correct his rash ones, and knew how to deny himself. Did David look upon that water as very precious which was got at the hazard of these men's blood, and shall not we much more value those benefits for purchasing which our blessed Saviour shed his blood?

He would not drink it, however, but poured it out upon the ground to the Lord, as a drink-offering for Jehovah. "He poured it out upon the earth, rendering Him thanks for the return of the three brave men" (Clericus). And he said, "Far be it from me, O Jehovah, to do this! The blood of the men who went with their lives (i.e., at the risk of their lives)," sc., should I drink it? The verb &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; is wanting in our text, but is not to be inserted according to the Chronicles as though it had fallen out; the sentence is rather to be regarded as an aposiopesis. &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; after &#1500;&#1497; &#1495;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492; is a vocative, and is not to be altered into &#1502;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; according to the &#1502;&#1488;&#1500;&#1495;&#1497; of the Chronicles. The fact that the vocative does not occur in other passages after &#1500;&#1497; &#1495;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492; proves nothing. It is equivalent to the oath &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1495;&#1497;   (<a href="/1_samuel/14-45.htm">1 Samuel 14:45</a>). The chronicler has endeavoured to simplify David's exclamation by completing the sentence. &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501;, "for the price of their souls," i.e., at the risk of their lives. The water drawn and fetched at the risk of their lives is compared to the soul itself, and the soul is in the blood (<a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>). Drinking this water, therefore, would be nothing else than drinking their blood.</body></html>
