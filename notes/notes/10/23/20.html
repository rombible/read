Were his valiant men so forward to expose themselves, upon the least hint of their prince's mind, and so eager to please him, and shall not we long to approve ourselves to our Lord Jesus, by ready compliance with his will, as shown us by his word, Spirit, and providence? But David poured out the water as a drink-offering to the Lord. Thus he would cross his own foolish fancy, and punish himself for indulging it, and show that he had sober thoughts to correct his rash ones, and knew how to deny himself. Did David look upon that water as very precious which was got at the hazard of these men's blood, and shall not we much more value those benefits for purchasing which our blessed Saviour shed his blood?

Procopius Gazaeus says Benaiah was David's brother's son, and a grandson of Jesse: <p>who had done many acts; which may refer either to the father of Benaiah or to Benaiah himself; and indeed the Syriac and Arabic versions refer the preceding character, "a valiant man", not to the father, but the son: <p>he slew two lionlike men of Moab; two princes of Moab, as the Targum, or two giants of Moab, as the Syriac and Arabic versions; men who were comparable to lions for their strength and courage; for this is not to be understood of two strong towers of Moab, as Ben Gersom, which were defended by valiant men like lions, or which had the form of lions engraved on them: nor of Moabitish altars, as Gussetius (f), the altar of the Lord, being called by this name of Ariel, the word used; but of men of uncommon valour and fortitude: <p>he went down also, and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow; not Joab, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/2-34.htm">1 Kings 2:34</a>, as is the tradition (g), but a real lion, the strongest among the beasts; and that in a pit where he could not keep his distance, and turn himself, and take all advantage, and from whence he could not make his escape; and which indeed might quicken his resolution, when he must fight or die; and on a snowy day, when lions are said to have the greatest strength, as in cold weather, or however are fiercer for want of food; and when Benaiah might be benumbed in his hands and feet with cold. Josephus (h) represents the case thus, that the lion fell into a pit, where was much snow, and was covered with it, and making a hideous roaring, Benaiah went down and slew him; but rather it was what others say, that this lion very much infested the places adjacent, and did much harm; and therefore, for the good of the country, and to rid them of it, took this opportunity, and slew it; which one would think was not one of the best reasons that might offer; it seems best therefore what Bochart (i) conjectures, that Benaiah went into a cave, for so the word used may signify, to shelter himself a while from the cold, when a lion, being in it for the same reason, attacked him, and he fought with it and slew it; or rather it may be an hollow place, a valley that lay between Acra and Zion, where Benaiah, hearing a lion roar, went down and slew it (k). <p>(f) Ebr.

The Syriac supports the Authorized Version in understanding by the term "heroes," or "champions;" but the use of poetical language in a prosaic catalogue is so strange that the Septuagint is probably right.

And Benaiah had pity upon them, and came to the rescue, and went down into the pit, and, at the risk of his life, slew the lion. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/23.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>To this deed there is appended a similar heroic feat performed by three of the thirty heroes whose names are not given. The Chethib &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; is evidently a slip of the pen for &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; (Keri and Chronicles). The thirty chiefs are the heroes named afterwards. As &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; has no article either in our text or the Chronicles, the three intended are not the three already mentioned (Jashobeam, Eleazar, and Shammah), but three others out of the number mentioned in <a href="/2_samuel/23-24.htm">2 Samuel 23:24</a>. These three came to David in the harvest time unto the cave of Adullam (see at <a href="/1_samuel/22-1.htm">1 Samuel 22:1</a>), when a troop of the Philistines was encamped in the valley of Rephaim, and David was on the mountain fortress, and a Philistian post was then in Bethlehem. And David longed for water, and said, "Oh that one would bring me water to drink out of the well of Bethlehem at the gate!" The encampment of the Philistines in the valley of Rephaim, and the position of David on the mountain fortress (&#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1492;), render it probable that the feat mentioned here took place in the war with the Philistines described in <a href="/2_samuel/5-17.htm">2 Samuel 5:17</a>. Robinson could not discover any well in Bethlehem, "especially none 'by the gate,' except one connected with the aqueduct on the south" (Palestine, vol. ii. p. 158). &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512; need not be understood, however, as signifying that the well was in or under the gate; but the well referred to may have been at the gate outside the city. The well to which tradition has given the name of "David's well" (cisterna David), is about a quarter of an hour's walk to the north-east of Bethlehem, and, according to Robinson's description, is "merely a deep and wide cistern or cavern now dry, with three or four narrow openings cut in the rock." But Ritter (Erdk. xvi. p. 286) describes it as "deep with clear cool water, into which there are three openings from above, which Tobler speaks of as bored;" and again as a cistern "built with peculiar beauty, from seventeen to twenty-one feet deep, whilst a house close by is pointed out to pilgrims as Jesse's house." </body></html>
