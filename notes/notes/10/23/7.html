David the son of Jesse said, and the man who was exalted to the kingdom said, the anointed by the word of the God of Jacob, and appointed that he might preside over the sweetness of the praises of Israel. (2) David said, In the spirit of prophecy of the Lord I speak these things, and the words of His holiness do I order in my mouth. (3) David said, The God of Israel spake concerning me, the Strong One of Israel who ruleth over the sons of men, the true Judge, said that He would appoint for me a king; He is the Messiah, who shall arise and rule in the fear of the Lord.”<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/23.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>23:1-7 These words of David are very worthy of regard. Let those who have had long experience of God's goodness, and the pleasantness of heavenly wisdom, when they come to finish their course, bear their testimony to the truth of the promise. David avows his Divine inspiration, that the Spirit of God spake by him. He, and other holy men, spake and wrote as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. In many things he had his own neglect and wrong conduct to blame. But David comforted himself that the Lord had made with him an everlasting covenant. By this he principally intended the covenant of mercy and peace, which the Lord made with him as a sinner, who believed in the promised Saviour, who embraced the promised blessing, who yielded up himself to the Lord, to be his redeemed servant. Believers shall for ever enjoy covenant blessings; and God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, shall be for ever glorified in their salvation. Thus pardon, righteousness, grace, and eternal life, are secured as the gift of God through Jesus Christ. There is an infinite fulness of grace and all blessings treasured up in Christ, for those who seek his salvation. This covenant was all David's salvation, he so well knew the holy law of God and the extent of his own sinfulness, that he perceived what was needful for his own case in this salvation. It was therefore all his desire. In comparison, all earthly objects lost their attractions; he was willing to give them up, or to die and leave them, that he might enjoy full happiness, Ps 73:24-28. Still the power of evil, and the weakness of his faith, hope, and love, were his grief and burden. Doubtless he would have allowed that his own slackness and want of care were the cause; but the hope that he should soon be made perfect in glory, encouraged him in his dying moments.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Although my house ... - The sense of this clause (according to the the King James Version) will be that David comparing the actual state of his family and kingdom during the later years of trouble and disaster with the prophetic description of the prosperity of the righteous king, and seeing how far it falls short, comforts himself by the terms of God's covenant <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a> and looks forward to Messiah's kingdom. The latter clause, "although he make it not to grow," must then mean that, although at the present time the glory of his house was not made to grow, yet all his salvation and all his desire was made sure in the covenant which would be fulfilled in due time. But most modern commentators understand both clauses as follows: "Is not my house so with God that He has made with me an everlasting covenant," etc.? "For all my salvation and all my desire, will He not cause it to spring up?" namely, in the kingdom of Solomon, and still more fully in the kingdom of Christ. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/23.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6.

They resemble those prickly, thorny plants which are twisted together, whose spires point in every direction, and which are so sharp and strong that they cannot be touched or approached without danger; but hard instruments and violent means must be taken to destroy or uproot them. So God will remove or destroy all who are opposed to this kingdom.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/23.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The staff of a spear; </span> so the meaning is, he must fill his hand, or arm himself <span class="ital">with</span> some <span class="ital">iron</span> weapon, whereby he may cut them down; or, <span class="ital">with the staff of a spear</span>, or some such like thing, whereby he may thrust them away from himself, that they do him no hurt.

And it may possibly intimate, that those children of Belial, the wicked and unbelieving Jews, who rejected and rebelled against the Messiah, David’s successor, and their lawful King, should be destroyed in their great, and strong, and holy city Jerusalem, where the greatest part of that people were gathered together as fuel for the fire, and were destroyed together by the Romans under Titus, where also their wicked predecessors had been destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar in former times. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/23.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But the man that shall touch them must be fenced with iron and the staff of a spear,.... To remove these thorns, or sons of Belial, out of the way, or to defend himself against them; or weapons of war must be made use of to conquer and destroy them, according to the sense of Ben Gersom, and which De Dieu follows; a man that meddles with them must expect to be as much hurt and wounded by them, all over the body, as if not only the point or iron head of a spear, but the wood or handle of the spear, were thrust up in him; but the former sense seems best: <p>and they shall be utterly burnt with fire in the same place: where the thorns grew, or whither they are removed, or are sitting; where persons are sitting to warm themselves by them: and this may be understood of the destruction of wicked rulers, when their kingdom is taken from them, and they are consumed root and branch; and was true not only of Saul, and his posterity, as some apply it, and of Jeroboam, and those like to him, as the above Jewish writer; but of the wicked Jews, and their rulers, those sons of Belial, who rejected the yoke of Christ, and would not have him to rule over them; to whom the Lord sent the Roman armies fenced with swords and spears, and burnt their city, and destroyed them in the same place; and may take in antichrist, and antichristian states, those sons of Belial, of the wicked  and lawless one, the son of perdition, whose city, Rome, shall be burnt with fire; and even all wicked men, at the great day of judgment, to which the Targum refers these words; when they, whose end, like thorns, is to be burnt, will be cast into the lake which burns with fire and brimstone. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_samuel/23.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But the man that shall touch them must be fenced with iron and the staff of a spear; and they shall be utterly burned with fire in the same place.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/2_samuel/23.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">7</span>. <span class="ital">But the man</span>, &c.] <span class="bld">But the man who toucheth them must arm himself with iron and a spear shaft.</span> The thorns cannot be touched by hand, but must be torn up with an iron hook fastened to a long handle.

This not only shows to what extent David had occupied himself with the utterances of the earlier men of God concerning Israel's future; but indicates, at the same time, that his own prophetic utterance was intended to be a further expansion of Balaam's prophecy concerning the Star out of Jacob and the Sceptre out of Israel. Like Balaam, he calls his prophecy a &#1504;&#1488;&#1501;, i.e., a divine saying or oracle, as a revelation which he had received directly from God (see at <a href="/numbers/24-3.htm">Numbers 24:3</a>). But the recipient of this revelation was not, like Balaam the son of Beor, a man with closed eye, whose eyes had been opened by a vision of the Almighty, but "the man who was raised up on high" (&#1506;&#1500;, adverbially "above," is, strictly speaking, a substantive, "height," used in an adverbial sense, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/11-7.htm">Hosea 11:7</a>, and probably also <a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>), i.e., whom God had lifted up out of humiliation to be the ruler of His people, yea, even to be the head of the nations (<a href="/2_samuel/22-44.htm">2 Samuel 22:44</a>). Luther's rendering, "who is assured of the Messiah of the God of Jacob," is based upon the Vulgate, "cui constitutum est de Christo Dei Jacob," and cannot be grammatically sustained. David was exalted on the one hand as "the anointed of the God of Jacob," i.e., as the one whom the God of Israel had anointed king over His people, and on the other hand as "the lovely one in Israel's songs of praise," i.e., the man whom God had enabled to sing lovely songs of praise in celebration of His grace and glory. &#1494;&#1502;&#1497;&#1512;  equals  &#1494;&#1502;&#1512;&#1492; does not mean a song generally, but a song of praise in honour of God (see at <a href="/exodus/15-2.htm">Exodus 15:2</a>), like &#1502;&#1494;&#1502;&#1493;&#1512; in the headings to the psalms. As David on the one hand had firmly established the kingdom of God in an earthly and political respect as the anointed of Jehovah, i.e., as king, so had he on the other, as the composer of Israel's songs of praise, promoted the spiritual edification of that kingdom. The idea of &#1504;&#1488;&#1501; is explained in <a href="/2_samuel/23-2.htm">2 Samuel 23:2</a>. The Spirit of Jehovah speaks through him; his words are the inspiration of God. The preterite &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; relates to the divine inspiration which preceded the utterance of the divine saying. &#1489;&#1468; &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;, literally to speak into a person, as in <a href="/hosea/1-2.htm">Hosea 1:2</a>. The saying itself commences with <a href="/2_samuel/23-3.htm">2 Samuel 23:3</a>.</body></html>
