It seems to be an instance of weakness. He was thirsty; with the water of that well he had often refreshed himself when a youth, and it was without due thought that he desired it. Were his valiant men so forward to expose themselves, upon the least hint of their prince's mind, and so eager to please him, and shall not we long to approve ourselves to our Lord Jesus, by ready compliance with his will, as shown us by his word, Spirit, and providence? But David poured out the water as a drink-offering to the Lord. Thus he would cross his own foolish fancy, and punish himself for indulging it, and show that he had sober thoughts to correct his rash ones, and knew how to deny himself. Did David look upon that water as very precious which was got at the hazard of these men's blood, and shall not we much more value those benefits for purchasing which our blessed Saviour shed his blood?

A Catalogue of His Mighty Men.<p>8. These be the names of the mighty men whom David had&#8212;This verse should be translated thus: He who sits in the seat of the Tachmonite (that is, of Jashobeam the Hachmonite), who was chief among the captains, the same is Adino the Eznite; he lift up his spear against eight hundred, whom he slew at one time. The text is corrupt in this passage; the number eight hundred should be three hundred [Davidson, Hermeneutics]. Under Joab he was chief or president of the council of war. The first or highest order was composed of him and his two colleagues, Eleazar and Shammah. Eleazar seems to have been left to fight the Philistines alone; and on his achieving the victory, they returned to the spoil. In like manner Shammah was left to stand alone in his glory, when the Lord, by him, wrought a great victory. It is not very easy to determine whether the exploits that are afterwards described were performed by the first or the second three.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/23.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Defended it; </span> that the Philistines could neither burn, nor tread it down and spoil it or carry it away. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/23.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But he stood in the midst of the ground,....

The abstract &#1489;&#1500;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;, worthlessness, is stronger than &#1489;&#1500;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, the worthless man, and depicts the godless as personified worthlessness. &#1502;&#1504;&#1491;, in the Keri &#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1491;, the Hophal of &#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491; or &#1504;&#1491;&#1491;, literally "scared" or hunted away. This epithet does not apply to the thorns, so well as to the ungodly who are compared to thorns. The reference is to thorns that men root out, not to those which they avoid on account of their prickles. &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;&#1501;, an antiquated form for &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1501; (see Ewald, 247, d.). To root them out, or clean the ground of them, men do not lay hold of them with the bare hand; but "whoever would touch them equips himself (&#1497;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;, sc., &#1497;&#1491;&#1493;, to 'fill the hand' with anything: <a href="/2_kings/9-24.htm">2 Kings 9:24</a>) with iron, i.e., with iron weapons, and spear-shaft" (vid., <a href="/1_samuel/17-7.htm">1 Samuel 17:7</a>). This expression also relates to the godless rather than to the thorns. They are consumed &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1489;&#1514;, "at the dwelling," i.e., as Kimchi explains, at the place of their dwelling, the place where they grow. For &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1489;&#1514; cannot mean "on the spot" in the sense of without delay. The burning of the thorns takes place at the final judgment upon the ungodly (<a href="/matthew/13-30.htm">Matthew 13:30</a>). </body></html>
