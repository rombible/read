He had low thoughts of his own merits. All we have, must be looked upon as Divine gifts. He speaks very highly and honourably of the Lord's favours to him. Considering what the character and condition of man is, we may be amazed that God should deal with him as he does. The promise of Christ includes all; if the Lord God be ours, what more can we ask, or think of? Eph 3:20. He knows us better than we know ourselves; therefore let us be satisfied with what he has done for us. What can we say more for ourselves in our prayers, than God has said for us in his promises? David ascribes all to the free grace of God. Both the great things He had done for him, and the great things He had made known to him. All was for his word's sake, that is, for the sake of Christ the eternal Word. Many, when they go to pray, have their hearts to seek, but David's heart was found, that is, it was fixed; gathered in from its wanderings, entirely engaged to the duty, and employed in it. That prayer which is from the tongue only, will not please God; it must be found in the heart; that must be lifted up and poured out before God. He builds his faith, and hopes to speed, upon the sureness of God's promise. David prays for the performance of the promise. With God, saying and doing are not two things, as they often are with men; God will do as he hath said. The promises of God are not made to us by name, as to David, but they belong to all who believe in Jesus Christ, and plead them in his name.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The nations and their gods - i e. the people and the idols of Canaan. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20. what can David say more unto thee?&#8212;that is, my obligations are greater than I can express.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The Lord of hosts is the God over Israel, </span> i.e. do thou never cease to manifest thyself to be the God and Governor of Israel. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And let thy name be magnified for ever,.... David desired the performance of the above things not so much for his own sake, and for the sake of his family, as for the glory of God; his great concern was, that God might be magnified, and his greatness displayed, in making him and his family great; and particularly that he might be magnified and glorified in that famous Son of his, the Messiah, as he has been, <a href="/john/13-31.htm">John 13:31</a>; and by all his people in succeeding ages: <p>saying, the Lord of hosts is the God over Israel; the Lord of armies above and below, is God over all, and in a special and peculiar manner God over Israel, literal and spiritual, that takes care of them, supplies, protects, and defends them: <p>and let the house of thy servant David be established before thee; as he had promised, <a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_samuel/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts <i>is</i> the God over Israel: and let the <span class="cverse3">{n}</span> house of thy servant David be established before thee.</span><p>(n) This prayer is most effective when we chiefly seek God's glory, and the accomplishment of his promise.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/2_samuel/7.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">26</span>. <span class="ital">let the house of thy servant David be established</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">the house of thy servant David shall be established</span>; an expression of confident assurance, the ground of which is introduced by the “for” of <span class="ital"><a href="/2_samuel/7-27.htm" title="For you, O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, have revealed to your servant, saying, I will build you an house: therefore has your servant found in his heart to pray this prayer to you.">2 Samuel 7:27</a></span>.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"And what more shall David speak to Thee?
