Thus, among the favours which God had vouchsafed, and would vouchsafe to David, he reckons his blessings to Israel, because they were great blessings to David; partly, because the strength and happiness of a king consists in the multitude and happiness of his people; and partly, because David was a man of a public spirit, and therefore no less affected with Israel’s felicity than with his own.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:4-17 Blessings are promised to the family and posterity of David. These promises relate to Solomon, David's immediate successor, and the royal line of Judah. But they also relate to Christ, who is often called David and the Son of David. To him God gave all power in heaven and earth, with authority to execute judgment. He was to build the gospel temple, a house for God's name; the spiritual temple of true believers, to be a habitation of God through the Spirit. The establishing of his house, his throne, and his kingdom for ever, can be applied to no other than to Christ and his kingdom: David's house and kingdom long since came to an end. The committing iniquity cannot be applied to the Messiah himself, but to his spiritual seed; true believers have infirmities, for which they must expect to be corrected, though they are not cast off.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The tribes of Israel - The duplicate passage reads judges (see margin and compare <a href="/2_samuel/7-11.htm">2 Samuel 7:11</a>).

It was, first of all, a type of Messiah's reign, to whom God has premised the heathen for his inheritance, and that his gospel shall be carried to the ends of the earth. But, secondly, if Messiah was to be "David's Son," it was necessary that that king should hold a special place in the hearts of all Israelites. In the fables and tales of the Arabs, it is Solomon who holds the foremost place. Just as our forefathers showed the native qualities of the race by making Arthur's court the abode of prowess and chivalrous bravery; so the Arabs made Solomon's court the representative of that dazzling splendor and magnificence which they so admired; and invested him with superhuman knowledge and magical power, such as made janns and ifreets the humble slaves of his will. In the Old Testament no king is "Jehovah's servant" but David; no king is ever connected with Messiah but David. The religious fervent of the people may gather round a Hezekiah or a Josiah, and prophets may encourage them in their work; but no prophet sees in either of them the ancestor of Christ. It is, however, in the Psalms that we learn the full meaning of  Nathan's words. Here a veil is partly drawn over them. But it would be a wilful closing of the eyes to read this message and not bear in mind the clear light with which every word is illumined by the inspired outpouring of David's own heart. He thoroughly understood the fulness and blessedness of God's revelation, and has taught us that it all looked onward to Christ. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When David was dwelling in his house, i.e., the palace of cedar (<a href="/2_samuel/5-11.htm">2 Samuel 5:11</a>), and Jehovah had given him rest from all his enemies round about, he said to Nathan the prophet: "See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, and the ark of God dwelleth within the curtains." &#1492;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1506;&#1492; in the singular is used, In <a href="/exodus/26-2.htm">Exodus 26:2</a>., to denote the inner covering, composed of a number of lengths of tapestry sewn together, which was spread over the planks of the tabernacle, and made it into a dwelling, whereas the separate pieces of tapestry are called &#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1506;&#1514; in the plural; and hence, in the later writers, &#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514; alternates sometimes with &#1488;&#1492;&#1500; (<a href="/isaiah/54-2.htm">Isaiah 54:2</a>), and at other times with &#1488;&#1492;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; (Sol 1:5; <a href="/jeremiah/4-20.htm">Jeremiah 4:20</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/49-29.htm">Jeremiah 49:29</a>). Consequently &#1492;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1506;&#1492; refers here to the tent-cloth or tent formed of pieces of tapestry. "Within (i.e., surrounded by) the tent-cloth:" in the Chronicles we find "under curtains." From the words "when the Lord had given him rest from all his enemies round about," it is evident that David did not form the resolution to build the temple in the first years of his reign upon Zion, nor immediately after the completion of his palace, but at a later period (see the remarks on <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-11.htm">2 Samuel 5:11</a>, note). It is true that the giving of rest from all his enemies round about does not definitely presuppose the termination of all the greater wars of David, since it is not affirmed that this rest was a definitive one; but the words cannot possibly be restricted to the two victories over the Philistines (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-17.htm">2 Samuel 5:17-25</a>), as Hengstenberg supposes, inasmuch as, however important the second may have been, their foes were not even permanently quieted by them, to say nothing of their being entirely subdued. Moreover, in the promise mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-9.htm">2 Samuel 7:9</a>, God distinctly says, "I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off all thine enemies before thee." These words also show that at that time David had already fought against all the enemies round about, and humbled them. Now, as all David's principal wars are grouped together for the first time in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/8.htm">2 Samuel 8</a> and 10, there can be no doubt that the history is not arranged in a strictly chronological order. And the expression "after this" in <a href="/2_samuel/8-1.htm">2 Samuel 8:1</a> is by no means at variance with this, since this formula does not at all express a strictly chronological sequence. From the words of the prophet, "Go, do all that is in thy heart, for the Lord is with thee," it is very evident that David had expressed the intention to build a splendid palatial temple. The word &#1500;&#1498;, go (equivalent to "quite right"), is omitted in the Chronicles as superfluous. Nathan sanctioned the king's resolution "from his own feelings, and not by divine revelation" (J. H. Michaelis); but he did not "afterwards perceive that the time for carrying out this intention had not yet come," as Thenius and Bertheau maintain; on the contrary, the Lord God revealed to the prophet that David was not to carry out his intention at all. </body></html>
