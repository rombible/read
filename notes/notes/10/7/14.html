These promises relate to Solomon, David's immediate successor, and the royal line of Judah. But they also relate to Christ, who is often called David and the Son of David. To him God gave all power in heaven and earth, with authority to execute judgment. He was to build the gospel temple, a house for God's name; the spiritual temple of true believers, to be a habitation of God through the Spirit. The establishing of his house, his throne, and his kingdom for ever, can be applied to no other than to Christ and his kingdom: David's house and kingdom long since came to an end. The committing iniquity cannot be applied to the Messiah himself, but to his spiritual seed; true believers have infirmities, for which they must expect to be corrected, though they are not cast off.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I will be his father ... - In marginal reference the equivalent expressions are applied to David.

Whatsoever the father hath, that belongs also to the son by natural right. But this sonship is magnified in the Psalms beyond the measure of Solomon or any natural limits. The Son there is "the Firstborn," which Solomon was not, "higher than the kings of the earth" (<a href="/psalms/89-27.htm">Psalm 89:27</a>); and he must have "the nations for his inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for his possession" (<a href="/psalms/2-8.htm">Psalm 2:8</a>). Psalms like the second and seventy-second belong, not to Solomon personally, but to him as the type of the prince of Peace; and they help to show us what is the true meaning and fulfilment of the words here. <span class="cmt_word">The rod of men;</span> that is, such punishment as men fitly receive for their faults. David's natural posterity was to be exempt neither from human depravity, nor from punishment, nor from the changes and chances of mortal life. With them, as with men generally, there would be a tangled skein, of virtue and sin, of folly and wisdom, of terrible fall and penitent recovery. But there was to be no blotting out of David's lineage. Great earthly houses, in the long course of events, one after another become extinct, and even the tabernacle of David was to fall (<a href="/amos/9-11.htm">Amos 9:11</a>), but not forever. God would "raise up its ruins' in Christ, and "build it as in the days of old." So in <a href="/isaiah/9-1.htm">Isaiah 9:1</a> there is the same thought of the complete down-hewing of David's earthly lineage, yet only to rise again to nobler life and vigour, in the Branch, or Sucker, that was to spring from the fallen trunk. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>After thus declining his proposal, the Lord made known His gracious purpose to David: "Thus saith Jehovah of hosts" (not only Jehovah, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-5.htm">2 Samuel 7:5</a>, but Jehovah Sebaoth, because He manifests himself in the following revelation as the God of the universe): "I have taken thee from the pasturage (grass-plat), behind the flock, to be prince over my people Israel; and was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and exterminated all thine enemies before thee, and so made thee, &#1493;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497; (perfect with vav consec.), a great name, ... and created a place for my people Israel, and planted them, so that they dwell in their place, and do not tremble any more (before their oppressors); and the sons of wickedness do not oppress them any further, as at the beginning, and from the day when I appointed judges over my people Israel: and I create thee rest from all thine enemies. And Jehovah proclaims to thee, that Jehovah will make thee a house." The words &#1497;&#1513;&#1474; &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497; ... &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1501; &#1500;&#1502;&#1503; are to be joined to &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492;, "as in the beginning," i.e., in Egypt, and from the time of the judges; that is to say, during the rule of the judges, when the surrounding nations constantly oppressed and subjugated Israel. The plan usually adopted, of connecting the words with &#1493;&#1492;&#1504;&#1497;&#1495;&#1514;&#1497;, does not yield any suitable thought at all, as God had not given David rest from the very beginning of the times of the judges; but the period of the judges was long antecedent to the time of David, and was not a period of rest for the Israelites. Again, &#1493;&#1492;&#1504;&#1497;&#1495;&#1514;&#1497; does not resume what is stated in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-9.htm">2 Samuel 7:9</a>, and is not to be rendered as a preterite in the sense of "I have procured thee rest," but as a perfect with vav consec., "and I procure thee rest" from what is now about to come to pass. And &#1493;&#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491; is to be taken in the same way: the Lord shows thee, first of all through His promise (which follows), and then through the fact itself, the realization of His word. &#1493;&#1492;&#1504;&#1497;&#1495;&#1514;&#1497; refers to the future, as well as the building of David's house, and therefore not to the rest from all his enemies, which God had already secured for David, but to that which He would still further secure for him, that is to say, to the maintenance and establishment of that rest. The commentary upon this is to be found in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/89-22.htm">Psalm 89:22-24</a>. In the Chronicles (<a href="/1_chronicles/17-10.htm">1 Chronicles 17:10</a>) there is a somewhat different turn given to the last clauses: "and I bend down all thine enemies, and make it (the bending-down) known to thee (by the fact), and a house will Jehovah build for thee." The thought is not essentially changed by this; consequently there is no ground for any emendation of the text, which is not even apparently necessary, unless, like Bertheau, we misinterpret the words, and connect &#1493;&#1492;&#1499;&#1504;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; erroneously with the previous clause.<p><a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-8.htm">2 Samuel 7:8-11</a><p>The connection between <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-5.htm">2 Samuel 7:5-7</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-8.htm">2 Samuel 7:8-16</a> has been correctly indicated by Thenius as follows: Thou shalt not build a house for Me; but I, who have from the very beginning glorified myself in thee and my people (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-8.htm">2 Samuel 7:8-11</a>), will build a house for thee; and thy son shall erect a house for me (<a href="/2_samuel/7-13.htm">2 Samuel 7:13</a>). This thought is not merely "a play upon words entirely in the spirit of prophecy," but contains the deep general truth that God must first of all build a man's house, before the man can build God's house, and applies it especially to the kingdom of God in Israel. As long as the quiet and full possession of the land of Canaan, which had been promised by the Lord to the people of God for their inheritance, was disputed by their enemies round about, even the dwelling-place of their God could not assume any other form than that of a wanderer's tent. The kingdom of God in Israel first acquired its rest and consolation through the efforts of David, when God had made all his foes subject to him and established his throne firmly, i.e., had assured to his descendants the possession of the kingdom for all future time. And it was this which ushered in the time for the building of a stationary house as a dwelling for the name of the Lord, i.e., for the visible manifestation of the presence of God in the midst of His people. The conquest of the citadel of Zion and the elevation of this fortress into the palace of the king, whom the Lord had given to His people, formed the commencement of the establishment of the kingdom of God. But this commencement received its first pledge of perpetuity from the divine assurance that the throne of David should be established for all future time. And this the Lord was about to accomplish: He would build David a house, and then his seed should build the house of the Lord. No definite reason is assigned why David himself was not to build the temple. We learn this first of all from David's last words (<a href="/1_chronicles/28-3.htm">1 Chronicles 28:3</a>), in which he says to the assembled heads of the nation, "God said to me, Thou shalt not build a house for my name, because thou art a man of wars, and hast shed blood." Compare with this the similar words of David to Solomon in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-8.htm">1 Chronicles 22:8</a>, and Solomon's statement in his message to Hiram, that David had been prevented from building the temple in consequence of his many wars. It was probably not till afterwards that David was informed by Nathan what the true reason was. As Hengstenberg has correctly observed, the fact that David was not permitted to build the temple on account of his own personal unworthiness, did not involve any blame for what he had done; for David stood in a closer relation to the Lord than Solomon did, and the wars which he waged were wars of the Lord (<a href="/1_samuel/25-28.htm">1 Samuel 25:28</a>) for the maintenance and defence of the kingdom of God. But inasmuch as these wars were necessary and inevitable, they were practical proofs that David's kingdom and government were not yet established, and therefore that the time for the building of the temple had not yet come, and the rest of peace was not yet secured. The temple, as the symbolical representation of the kingdom of God, as also to correspond to the nature of that kingdom, and shadow forth the peace of the kingdom of God. For this reason, David, the man of war, was not to build the temple; but that was to be reserved for Solomon, the man of peace, the type of the Prince of Peace (<a href="/isaiah/9-5.htm">Isaiah 9:5</a>).</body></html>
