But these words, though according to our translation they are enclosed in the same parenthesis with the foregoing clauses, may be better put without it, and taken by themselves.

These promises relate to Solomon, David's immediate successor, and the royal line of Judah. But they also relate to Christ, who is often called David and the Son of David. To him God gave all power in heaven and earth, with authority to execute judgment. He was to build the gospel temple, a house for God's name; the spiritual temple of true believers, to be a habitation of God through the Spirit. The establishing of his house, his throne, and his kingdom for ever, can be applied to no other than to Christ and his kingdom: David's house and kingdom long since came to an end. The committing iniquity cannot be applied to the Messiah himself, but to his spiritual seed; true believers have infirmities, for which they must expect to be corrected, though they are not cast off.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Moreover I will appoint ... - It should be: And I have appointed a place, etc., and have planted them, etc. This was already done by the consolidation of David's kingdom. The contrast between this and <a href="/2_samuel/7-11.htm">2 Samuel 7:11</a> is that of the troubled, unsettled times of the Judges and the frequent servitudes of Israel in those times, with the settled prosperity and independence of the kingdom of David and Solomon. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11.

But all this is to be understood with a condition, except they should notoriously forsake God, or rebel against him; which being so oft declared by God in other places it was needless to mention it here. Or this may relate to the latter ages of the world, when the people of Israel shall be converted to Christ, and recalled out of captivity, and planted in their own place; when they shall enjoy a far greater degree of tranquillity than ever they did before. And this agrees best with the future tense, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I will appoint—and will plant them, </span>& c.; otherwise the work was already done, God had already appointed this land for them, and actually planted them in it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies, </span> i. e. and until this time in which I have given thee rest.
