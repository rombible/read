He had low thoughts of his own merits. All we have, must be looked upon as Divine gifts. He speaks very highly and honourably of the Lord's favours to him. Considering what the character and condition of man is, we may be amazed that God should deal with him as he does. The promise of Christ includes all; if the Lord God be ours, what more can we ask, or think of? Eph 3:20. He knows us better than we know ourselves; therefore let us be satisfied with what he has done for us. What can we say more for ourselves in our prayers, than God has said for us in his promises? David ascribes all to the free grace of God. Both the great things He had done for him, and the great things He had made known to him. All was for his word's sake, that is, for the sake of Christ the eternal Word. Many, when they go to pray, have their hearts to seek, but David's heart was found, that is, it was fixed; gathered in from its wanderings, entirely engaged to the duty, and employed in it. That prayer which is from the tongue only, will not please God; it must be found in the heart; that must be lifted up and poured out before God. He builds his faith, and hopes to speed, upon the sureness of God's promise. David prays for the performance of the promise. With God, saying and doing are not two things, as they often are with men; God will do as he hath said. The promises of God are not made to us by name, as to David, but they belong to all who believe in Jesus Christ, and plead them in his name.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Therefore hath thy servant found in his heart ... - The promises of God are the true guide to the prayers of His people. We may dare to ask anything, how great soever it may be, which God has promised to give. In this and the two following verses David expresses the same wonder at the riches of God's grace, and the same expectation founded on that grace, which Paul does. in such passages as <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/1-5.htm">Ephesians 1:5-7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/2-7.htm">Ephesians 2:7</a>, etc. marginal references. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20. what can David say more unto thee?&#8212;that is, my obligations are greater than I can express.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Thou, O Lord God, hast spoken it, </span> and therefore wilt certainly do it, for thy words never fail. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant,....

Thus David prays that the blessing may now at once begin to take effect. It is often rendered "please" in our version, because the verb is one used only of a determination resolved upon of the free will of the purposer. Its force is well seen in <a href="/job/6-9.htm">Job 6:9</a>, where what Job prays for is that God would deliberate no longer, but decide the matter and set about destroying him. The Authorized Version was led, by the use of this verse "please," to adopt the optative form. Really, it is the language of firm faith, and should be rendered, <span class="accented">And now</span> [there is no "therefore"] <span class="accented">begin of thy own good will, and bless the house of thy servant.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"And where is (any) like Thy people, like Israel, a nation upon earth, which God went to redeem as a people for himself, that He might make Him a name, and do great things for you, and terrible things for Thy land before Thy people, which Thou hast redeemed for Thee out of Egypt, (out of the) nations and their gods?" &#1502;&#1497; does not really mean where, but who, and is to be connected with the words immediately following, viz., &#1488;&#1495;&#1491; &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497; (one nation); but the only way in which the words can be rendered into good English (German in the original: Tr.) is, "where is there any people," etc. The relative &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; does not belong to &#1492;&#1500;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;, "which Elohim went to redeem." The construing of Elohim with a plural arises from the fact, that in this clause it not only refers to the true God, but also includes the idea of the gods of other nations. The idea, therefore, is not, "Is there any nation upon earth to which the only true God went?" but, "Is there any nation to which the deity worshipped by it went, as the true God went to Israel to redeem it for His own people?" The rendering given in the Septuagint to &#1492;&#1500;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;, viz., &#x3c9;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;, merely arose from a misapprehension of the true sense of the words; and the emendation &#1492;&#1493;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498;, which some propose in consequence, would only distort the sense. The stress laid upon the incomparable character of the things which God had done for Israel, is merely introduced to praise and celebrate the God who did this as the only true God. (For the thought itself, compare the original passage in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-7.htm">Deuteronomy 4:7</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/4-34.htm">Deuteronomy 4:34</a>.) In the clause &#1500;&#1499;&#1501; &#1493;&#1500;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1514;, "and to do for you," David addresses the people of Israel with oratorical vivacity. Instead of saying "to do great things to (for) Israel," he says "to do great things to (for you." For you forms an antithesis to him, "to make Him a name, and to do great things for you (Israel)." The suggestion made by some, that &#1500;&#1499;&#1501; is to be taken as a dativ. comm., and referred to Elohim, no more needs a serious refutation than the alteration into &#1500;&#1492;&#1501;. There have been different opinions, however, as to the object referred to in the suffix attached to &#1500;&#1488;&#1512;&#1510;&#1498;, and it is difficult to decide between them; for whilst the fact that &#1500;&#1488;&#1512;&#1510;&#1498; &#1504;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; (terrible things to Thy land) is governed by &#1500;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1514; (to do) favours the allusion to Israel, and the sudden transition from the plural to the singular might be accounted for from the deep emotion of the person speaking, the words which follow ("before Thy people") rather favour the allusion to God, as it does not seem natural to take the suffix in two different senses in the two objects which follow so closely the one upon the other, viz., "for Thy land," and "before Thy people;" whilst the way is prepared for a transition from speaking of God to speaking to God by the word &#1500;&#1499;&#1501; (to you). The words of <a href="/deuteronomy/10-21.htm">Deuteronomy 10:21</a> floated before the mind of David at the time, although he has given them a different turn. (On the "terrible things," see the commentary on <a href="/deuteronomy/10-21.htm">Deuteronomy 10:21</a> and <a href="/exodus/15-11.htm">Exodus 15:11</a>.) The connection of &#1504;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; (terrible things) with &#1500;&#1488;&#1512;&#1510;&#1498; (to Thy land) shows that David had in mind, when speaking of the acts of divine omnipotence which had inspired fear and dread of the majesty of God, not only the miracles of God in Egypt, but also the marvellous extermination of the Canaanites, whereby Israel had been established in the possession of the promised land, and the people of God placed in a condition to found a kingdom. These acts were performed before Israel, before the nation, whom the Lord redeemed to himself out of Egypt. This view is confirmed by the last words, "nations and their gods," which are in apposition to "from Egypt," so that the preposition &#1502;&#1503; should be repeated before &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501; (nations). The suffix to &#1493;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493; (literally "and its gods") is to be regarded as distributive: "the gods of each of these heathen nations." In the Chronicles (<a href="/1_chronicles/17-21.htm">1 Chronicles 17:21</a>) the expression is simplified, and explained more clearly by the omission of "to Thy land," and the insertion of &#1500;&#1490;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;, "to drive out nations from before Thy people." It has been erroneously inferred from this, that the text of our book is corrupt, and ought to be emended, or at any rate interpreted according to the Chronicles. But whilst &#1500;&#1488;&#1512;&#1510;&#1498; is certainly not to be altered into &#1500;&#1490;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;, it is just as wrong to do as Hengstenberg proposes, - namely, to take the thought expressed in &#1500;&#1490;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; from the preceding &#1500;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1514; by assuming a zeugma; for &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;, to do or make, has nothing in common with driving or clearing away.</body></html>
