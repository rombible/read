He had low thoughts of his own merits. All we have, must be looked upon as Divine gifts. He speaks very highly and honourably of the Lord's favours to him. Considering what the character and condition of man is, we may be amazed that God should deal with him as he does. The promise of Christ includes all; if the Lord God be ours, what more can we ask, or think of? Eph 3:20. He knows us better than we know ourselves; therefore let us be satisfied with what he has done for us. What can we say more for ourselves in our prayers, than God has said for us in his promises? David ascribes all to the free grace of God. Both the great things He had done for him, and the great things He had made known to him. All was for his word's sake, that is, for the sake of Christ the eternal Word. Many, when they go to pray, have their hearts to seek, but David's heart was found, that is, it was fixed; gathered in from its wanderings, entirely engaged to the duty, and employed in it. That prayer which is from the tongue only, will not please God; it must be found in the heart; that must be lifted up and poured out before God. He builds his faith, and hopes to speed, upon the sureness of God's promise. David prays for the performance of the promise. With God, saying and doing are not two things, as they often are with men; God will do as he hath said. The promises of God are not made to us by name, as to David, but they belong to all who believe in Jesus Christ, and plead them in his name.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Therefore hath thy servant found in his heart ... - The promises of God are the true guide to the prayers of His people. We may dare to ask anything, how great soever it may be, which God has promised to give. In this and the two following verses David expresses the same wonder at the riches of God's grace, and the same expectation founded on that grace, which Paul does. in such passages as <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/1-5.htm">Ephesians 1:5-7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/2-7.htm">Ephesians 2:7</a>, etc. marginal references. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20. what can David say more unto thee?&#8212;that is, my obligations are greater than I can express.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> That God who hast declared thyself to be Israelâ€™s God, and in particular my God. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And now, O Lord God, thou art that God,....

As this grammatical usage, which is common to all the Semitic languages, was not understood at the time when our version was made, we find all the parts of the verb "to be" constantly printed in italics, as though absent, while really they are expressed in the Oriental way. This has the advantage, however, of reminding the reader that wherever the verb "to be" is printed in Roman characters it has a much stronger meaning than the mere union of subject and predicate. Thus in <a href="/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a> the first "was," in Roman type, means "existed," or possibly "became;" the second "was," in italics, is simply the copula. Here the correct translation is, <span class="accented">And now, O Lord Jehovah, thou art the God</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the one real, true God. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"For Thy word's sake, and according to Thy heart (and therefore not because I am worthy of such grace), has Thou done all this greatness, to make it known to Thy servant." The word, for the sake of which God had done such great things for David, must be some former promise on the part of God. Hengstenberg supposes it to refer to the word of the Lord to Samuel, "Rise up and anoint him" (<a href="/1_samuel/16-12.htm">1 Samuel 16:12</a>), which is apparently favoured indeed by the parallel in the corresponding text of <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-19.htm">1 Chronicles 17:19</a>, "for Thy servant's sake," i.e., because Thou hast chosen Thy servant. But even this variation must contain some special allusion which does not exclude a general interpretation of the expression "for Thy word's sake," viz., an allusion to the earlier promises of God, or the Messianic prophecies generally, particularly the one concerning Judah in Jacob's blessing (<a href="/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>), and the one relating to the ruler out of Jacob in Balaam's sayings (<a href="/numbers/24-17.htm">Numbers 24:17</a>.), which contain the germs of the promise of the everlasting continuance of David's government. For the fact that David recognised the connection between the promise of God communicated to him by Nathan and Jacob's prophecy in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>, is evident from <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-4.htm">1 Chronicles 28:4</a>, where he refers to his election as king as being the consequence of the election of Judah as ruler. "According to Thine own heart" is equivalent to "according to Thy love and grace; for God is gracious, merciful, and of great kindness and truth" (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6</a>, compare <a href="/psalms/103-8.htm">Psalm 103:8</a>). &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492; does not mean great things, but greatness.<p>The praise of God commences in <a href="/2_samuel/7-22.htm">2 Samuel 7:22</a> : "wherefore Thou art great, Jehovah God; and there is not (one) like Thee, and no God beside Thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears." By the word "wherefore," i.e., because Thou hast done this, the praise of the singleness of God is set forth as the result of David's own experience. God is great when He manifests the greatness of His grace to men, and brings them to acknowledge it. And in these great deeds He proves the incomparable nature of His Deity, or that He alone is the true God. (For the fact itself, compare <a href="/exodus/15-11.htm">Exodus 15:11</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/3-24.htm">Deuteronomy 3:24</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/4-35.htm">Deuteronomy 4:35</a>.) </body></html>
