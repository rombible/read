Though God was pleased to give Moses directions for erecting the tabernacle, and afterward appointed Solomon to build him a more magnificent temple; yet this was done only with respect to, and as suitable to <span class="ital">men, </span>and not in regard of, or as any way suitable to himself. And the Scripture has taken great care to inculcate on us, <span class="ital">that the Most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands, </span><a href="/acts/7-4.htm" title="Then came he out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and dwelled in Charran: and from there, when his father was dead, he removed him into this land, wherein you now dwell.">Acts 7:4</a>. <span class="ital">Neither is worshipped with men’s hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things, </span><a href="/acts/17-24.htm" title="God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwells not in temples made with hands;">Acts 17:24</a>. And this is perhaps peculiar to the pure religion of the Scriptures; for if we attentively examine them, we shall find in all other religions something in the principle of them, as if the worship of God was founded on his needing something. And among most of them we find a meanness of thought, as if temples were something to the Deity himself; and not, as the Scriptures rightly describe them to be, as witnesses only to men, that God concerns himself with the inhabitants of the earth, and will hearken to their prayers. Thus we find St. Stephen, in the Acts of the Apostles, (<a href="/acts/7-4.htm" title="Then came he out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and dwelled in Charran: and from there, when his father was dead, he removed him into this land, wherein you now dwell.">Acts 7:4</a>,) calling the tabernacle, which Moses was ordered to make, <span class="ital">The tabernacle of witness. </span>And the Spirit of God put such a prayer into the heart and mouth of Solomon, at the dedication of the temple, as may sufficiently instruct us in what light the Holy Scriptures consider temples of any kind, namely, as concerning and having respect to men only, and as being nothing to God himself. <span class="ital">But will God indeed </span>(says Solomon) <span class="ital">dwell on the earth? Behold, the heaven, and heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house which I have builded? </span>And the Scriptures everywhere represent God as the maker of the world and all things therein, as the supreme Lord of heaven and earth, as having the whole heavens for his throne, and the earth for his footstool; and therefore needing or requiring no worship from men, but as it is conducive to their welfare and happiness. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:4-17 Blessings are promised to the family and posterity of David. These promises relate to Solomon, David's immediate successor, and the royal line of Judah. But they also relate to Christ, who is often called David and the Son of David. To him God gave all power in heaven and earth, with authority to execute judgment. He was to build the gospel temple, a house for God's name; the spiritual temple of true believers, to be a habitation of God through the Spirit. The establishing of his house, his throne, and his kingdom for ever, can be applied to no other than to Christ and his kingdom: David's house and kingdom long since came to an end. The committing iniquity cannot be applied to the Messiah himself, but to his spiritual seed; true believers have infirmities, for which they must expect to be corrected, though they are not cast off.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The tribes of Israel - The duplicate passage reads judges (see margin and compare <a href="/2_samuel/7-11.htm">2 Samuel 7:11</a>).

Instead of <span class="accented">tribes</span>, the Chronicler (<a href="/1_chronicles/17-6.htm">1 Chronicles 17:6</a>) reads "judges," the words in the Hebrew being almost identical. "Judges" is, of course, the more easy and natural reading, but "tribes" gives a fuller sense, and is supported by all the versions. For in the troubled anarchy which lasted until Saul's reign, first one tribe and then another was called to the front, and had a temporary ascendancy; but neither did Jehovah give it any command to provide a settled place for his worship, nor did any one of the judges conceive the thought of making his tribe permanently the chief, by providing a fixed abode for the ark and for God's worship within its borders. <span class="cmt_word">To feed my people Israel.</span> The shepherd, in biblical language, is the ruler, and <span class="accented">to feed</span> is to govern, yet in a kindly way, going in front as the shepherd before his flock, to bear the brunt of danger, to clear the road, and to guide into the safe pastures. So tribe after tribe had been called to bear the brunt of war, and, after winning deliverance, it became its duty to guide and lead the people. In <a href="/1_kings/8-16.htm">1 Kings 8:16, 18, 25</a>, and still more remarkably in <a href="/1_chronicles/22-8.htm">1 Chronicles 22:8, 9</a>, we find large additions made to the account here given. It follows that we have in this place only a brief summary of the message brought by Nathan, but one containing all the chief points. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When David was dwelling in his house, i.e., the palace of cedar (<a href="/2_samuel/5-11.htm">2 Samuel 5:11</a>), and Jehovah had given him rest from all his enemies round about, he said to Nathan the prophet: "See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, and the ark of God dwelleth within the curtains." &#1492;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1506;&#1492; in the singular is used, In <a href="/exodus/26-2.htm">Exodus 26:2</a>., to denote the inner covering, composed of a number of lengths of tapestry sewn together, which was spread over the planks of the tabernacle, and made it into a dwelling, whereas the separate pieces of tapestry are called &#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1506;&#1514; in the plural; and hence, in the later writers, &#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514; alternates sometimes with &#1488;&#1492;&#1500; (<a href="/isaiah/54-2.htm">Isaiah 54:2</a>), and at other times with &#1488;&#1492;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; (Sol 1:5; <a href="/jeremiah/4-20.htm">Jeremiah 4:20</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/49-29.htm">Jeremiah 49:29</a>). Consequently &#1492;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1506;&#1492; refers here to the tent-cloth or tent formed of pieces of tapestry. "Within (i.e., surrounded by) the tent-cloth:" in the Chronicles we find "under curtains." From the words "when the Lord had given him rest from all his enemies round about," it is evident that David did not form the resolution to build the temple in the first years of his reign upon Zion, nor immediately after the completion of his palace, but at a later period (see the remarks on <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-11.htm">2 Samuel 5:11</a>, note). It is true that the giving of rest from all his enemies round about does not definitely presuppose the termination of all the greater wars of David, since it is not affirmed that this rest was a definitive one; but the words cannot possibly be restricted to the two victories over the Philistines (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-17.htm">2 Samuel 5:17-25</a>), as Hengstenberg supposes, inasmuch as, however important the second may have been, their foes were not even permanently quieted by them, to say nothing of their being entirely subdued. Moreover, in the promise mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-9.htm">2 Samuel 7:9</a>, God distinctly says, "I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off all thine enemies before thee." These words also show that at that time David had already fought against all the enemies round about, and humbled them. Now, as all David's principal wars are grouped together for the first time in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/8.htm">2 Samuel 8</a> and 10, there can be no doubt that the history is not arranged in a strictly chronological order. And the expression "after this" in <a href="/2_samuel/8-1.htm">2 Samuel 8:1</a> is by no means at variance with this, since this formula does not at all express a strictly chronological sequence. From the words of the prophet, "Go, do all that is in thy heart, for the Lord is with thee," it is very evident that David had expressed the intention to build a splendid palatial temple. The word &#1500;&#1498;, go (equivalent to "quite right"), is omitted in the Chronicles as superfluous. Nathan sanctioned the king's resolution "from his own feelings, and not by divine revelation" (J. H. Michaelis); but he did not "afterwards perceive that the time for carrying out this intention had not yet come," as Thenius and Bertheau maintain; on the contrary, the Lord God revealed to the prophet that David was not to carry out his intention at all. </body></html>
