He had low thoughts of his own merits. All we have, must be looked upon as Divine gifts. He speaks very highly and honourably of the Lord's favours to him. Considering what the character and condition of man is, we may be amazed that God should deal with him as he does. The promise of Christ includes all; if the Lord God be ours, what more can we ask, or think of? Eph 3:20. He knows us better than we know ourselves; therefore let us be satisfied with what he has done for us. What can we say more for ourselves in our prayers, than God has said for us in his promises? David ascribes all to the free grace of God. Both the great things He had done for him, and the great things He had made known to him. All was for his word's sake, that is, for the sake of Christ the eternal Word. Many, when they go to pray, have their hearts to seek, but David's heart was found, that is, it was fixed; gathered in from its wanderings, entirely engaged to the duty, and employed in it. That prayer which is from the tongue only, will not please God; it must be found in the heart; that must be lifted up and poured out before God. He builds his faith, and hopes to speed, upon the sureness of God's promise. David prays for the performance of the promise. With God, saying and doing are not two things, as they often are with men; God will do as he hath said. The promises of God are not made to us by name, as to David, but they belong to all who believe in Jesus Christ, and plead them in his name.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The nations and their gods - i e. the people and the idols of Canaan. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20. what can David say more unto thee?&#8212;that is, my obligations are greater than I can express.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">God went, </span> to wit, into Egypt; an expression of God after the manner of men. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">To make him a name; </span> to advance the glory of his power and goodness, and other perfections.

Isaiah understand it of the true God, only suppose, as the former, that the plural expression is used for the sake of honour and glory; whereas, no doubt, respect is had to the three divine Persons in the Trinity, who were all concerned in the redemption of Israel, see <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/63-9.htm">Isaiah 63:9</a>, where mention is made of the Lord, and of the Angel of his presence, and of his holy Spirit, as engaged therein: <p>and to make him a name; either to get himself a name, and honour and glory in the world, to show forth his power and might, as well as his mercy and goodness, or to make his people famous, great, and glorious in the earth: <p>and to do for you great things and terrible; as he did in the land of Ham, at the Red sea, and in the wilderness, and in the land of Canaan, great things for his people, and terrible ones to their enemies: <p>for thy land; which is either spoken to God, whose was the land of Israel, and which he had chosen to dwell in, and had given to his people; or else to Israel, to whom the grant of this land was made, and who were put into the possession of it: <p>before thy people which thou redeemedst to thee from Egypt: that is, the great and terrible things were done in their sight, when they were redeemed from the bondage of Egypt, see <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/78-12.htm">Psalm 78:12</a>, <p>from the nations, and their gods? meaning, that they were redeemed not only from Egypt, but the nations of the Canaanites were driven out before them; nor could their idols save them, but destruction came upon them as upon the gods of the Egyptians: some leave out the supplement "from", and interpret this of the persons redeemed, even of the nations and tribes of Israel, and their great men, their rulers and civil magistrates, sometimes called gods. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_samuel/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And what one nation in the earth <i>is</i> like thy people, <i>even</i> like Israel, whom God went to redeem for a people to himself, and to make him a name, and to do for <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> you great things and terrible, for <span class="cverse3">{k}</span> thy land, before thy people, which thou redeemedst to thee from Egypt, <i>from</i> the <span class="cverse3">{l}</span> nations and their gods?</span><p>(i) O Israel.<p>(k) And inheritance, which is Israel.<p>(l) From the Egyptians and their idols.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/2_samuel/7.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">23</span>. <span class="ital">And what</span>, &c.] <span class="bld">For what</span>, &c., a further reason for the last statement.

Here the verb “went” is in the plural, which indicates that the gods of the nations are meant to be included. The sense is, ‘Where can any nation be found, which has been delivered by the deity it worships, as Israel was delivered from Egypt by Jehovah?’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">for you</span>] “You” can only refer to Israel, and an address to the people is quite out of place in David’s prayer to God. We must either omit <span class="ital">for you</span> with the LXX, or read <span class="ital">for them</span>, i.e. the nation, with the Vulgate.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">for thy land</span>] This gives no satisfactory sense, and “the nations and their gods” at the end of the verse has no proper construction in the existing text. It is best to emend the text by the help of the LXX, compared with <a href="/1_chronicles/17-21.htm" title="And what one nation in the earth is like your people Israel, whom God went to redeem to be his own people, to make you a name of greatness and terribleness, by driving out nations from before your people whom you have redeemed out of Egypt?">1 Chronicles 17:21</a>, and read <span class="ital">to drive out</span> in place of <span class="ital">for thy land</span>. The close of the verse will then stand thus; “<span class="ital">and to do great things and terrible, to drive out nations and their gods before thy people, which thou redeemedst for thyself out of Egypt</span>.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The construction, which began in the third person, in connexion with the relative clause, returns at the end of the verse to a direct address to God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">great things and terrible</span>] The miracles of the Exodus, the journey through the wilderness, the Entry into Canaan. Cp. <a href="/deuteronomy/10-21.htm" title="He is your praise, and he is your God, that has done for you these great and terrible things, which your eyes have seen.">Deuteronomy 10:21</a> for the phrase.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And what one nation,</span> etc.? The translation should be, <span class="accented">And who is like thy people, like Israel, the one nation upon earth which God went to redeem for himself to be his people, and to make for him a name</span>, etc.? Israel both was and remains to this day a nation unique in its history, both in those early dealings of God with it, and also in its later history and its marvellous preservation unto this day. It is remarkable that in this place the word for "God," <span class="accented">Elohim</span>, is followed by a verb plural, the almost invariable rule in Hebrew being that, though <span class="accented">Elohim</span> is itself plural, it takes a verb singular whenever it refers to the true God. In the corresponding passage (<a href="/1_chronicles/17-21.htm">1 Chronicles 17:21</a>) the verb is in the singular. No adequate reason has been given for this deviation, but probably the usage in these early times was not so strict as it became subsequently. It is the influence of writing, and of the eye becoming conversant with writing, that makes men correct in their use of language and in the spelling of words. In the Syriac Church, God the Word and God the Holy Ghost were at first spoken of in the feminine gender, because "Word" and "Spirit" are both feminine nouns; but grammar soon gave way to soundness of thought and feeling. So probably in colloquial language <span class="accented">Elohim</span> was often used with a verb plural, but correct thinking forbade and overruled grammar. We may regard this, then, as one of the few passages in which the colloquial usage has escaped correction, and attach no further importance to it. <span class="cmt_word">For you.</span> "You" is plural, and refers to the people. The Vulgate has "for them," which is in accordance with the greater exactness of modern grammar. But sudden changes of person are very common in Hebrew, which follows the rules of thought rather than of written composition; and so David speaks of Israel as <span class="accented">you</span>, because they seemed to him to be present. We must note, however, that in the words that follow, <span class="cmt_word">for thy land, and thy people,</span> the pronoun is singular, and refers to God. <span class="cmt_word">From the nations and their gods.</span> Both the Authorized Version and the Revised Version, by inserting "from," which is not in the Hebrew, take "nations" as in apposition with "Egypt;" but a moment's consideration shows that this is untenable, as "nations" is plural. But the whole verse is so full of grammatical difficulties as to make it extremely probable that the text is corrupt, and that we ought to supply the verb "to drive out," which is actually read in <a href="/1_chronicles/17-21.htm">1 Chronicles 17:21</a>, or even to substitute it in the place of "for thy land," which is omitted in the parallel passage. The nations which God drove out had nothing to do with Egypt, but were the seven dominant tribes of Canaan; and the bestowal upon Israel of their territories was as essential a part of Jehovah's dealings with his people as the Exodus itself. Thus the reading will be, <span class="accented">To drive out before thy people, whom thou purchasedst for thee from Egypt, nations and their gods.</span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"According to all these words ... did Nathan speak unto David," i.e., he related the whole to David, just as God had addressed it to him in the night. The clause in apposition, "according to all this vision," merely introduces a more minute definition of the peculiar form of the revelation. God spoke to Nathan in a vision which he had in the night, i.e., not in a dream, but in a waking condition, and during the night; for &#1495;&#1494;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503;  equals  &#1495;&#1494;&#1493;&#1503; is constantly distinguished from &#1495;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501;, a revelation in a dream. </body></html>
