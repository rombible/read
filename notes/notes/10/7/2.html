This is the first time this prophet is made mention of, but often afterwards, yet who he was, and from whence he came, is not known; he appears to be a man of great piety and prudence, as well as endowed with a prophetic spirit, and was very familiar with David, and perhaps dwelt in his palace; being a man on all accounts fit for conversation with princes, to whom David imparted what he had been meditating upon in his heart. The Jews have a tradition (t) that he was the same with Jonathan the son of Shimea, the brother of David, <a href="/2_samuel/21-21.htm">2 Samuel 21:21</a>; which is not very likely: <p>see now, I dwell in an house of cedar; made of the cedars of Lebanon; see what a spacious palace it is: <p>but the ark of God dwelleth within curtains; in a tabernacle within curtains, as the Targum; not the tabernacle of Moses, for that was at Gibeon, <a href="/1_chronicles/21-29.htm">1 Chronicles 21:29</a>; but that which David had made for it, which consisted of curtains that were drawn around it, <a href="/2_samuel/6-17.htm">2 Samuel 6:17</a>. It gave him a concern that he should dwell in so magnificent a palace, and the ark of God should have so mean an habitation; wherefore it was upon his mind to build a grand edifice for it, and this he suggested hereby to Nathan, and so he understood him, as appears by what follows; and the rather he was led to such a thought, being now at rest and in peace; for then it was an house was to be built for God, in which he would cause his name to dwell, as David might easily learn from <a href="/deuteronomy/12-9.htm">Deuteronomy 12:9</a>; and who so proper to set forward such a work as a king, and he when at rest from his enemies? <p>(t) Hieron.

And he came to him, and said to him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor.">2 Samuel 12:1</a> ff.); who became Solomon’s tutor (ch. <a href="/2_samuel/12-25.htm" title="And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his name Jedidiah, because of the LORD.">2 Samuel 12:25</a>, note), and took a leading part in securing his succession to the throne (<a href="/1_kings/1-22.htm" title="And, see, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet also came in.">1 Kings 1:22</a> ff.); who wrote a history of the reign of David and of part at least of the reign of Solomon (<a href="/1_chronicles/29-29.htm" title="Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of Samuel the seer, and in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the book of Gad the seer,">1 Chronicles 29:29</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/9-29.htm" title="Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, are they not written in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer against Jeroboam the son of Nebat?">2 Chronicles 9:29</a>), from which in all probability a large portion of the books of Samuel, Kings, and Chronicles, is derived.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">within curtains</span>] The term applied in <a href="/exodus/26-1.htm" title="Moreover you shall make the tabernacle with ten curtains of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet: with cherubim of cunning work shall you make them.">Exodus 26:1</a> ff; <a href="/exodus/36-8.htm" title="And every wise hearted man among them that worked the work of the tabernacle made ten curtains of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet: with cherubim of cunning work made he them.">Exodus 36:8</a> ff., to the coverings of the tabernacle.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A house of cedar;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">cedars.</span> As these trees were sent by Hiram, and as the house was built, and David now settled in it, some considerable time must have elapsed since his accession. Moreover, the league with Hiram would be the result of David's successes recorded in <a href="/2_samuel/8-1.htm">2 Samuel 8:1</a>; for the bond of union between the two was their mutual fear of the Philistines. As we have seen before, the alliance with Tyro had a very civilizing effect upon the Hebrews, who were far inferior to the Tyrians in the mechanical arts; and David's house of hewn cedar logs was marvellous in the eyes of a people who still dwelt chiefly in tents. David purposed to build even a more sumptuous palace for Jehovah, and advised with Nathan as his chief counsellor, and the person to whom subsequently the education of Solomon was confided. <span class="cmt_word">Within curtains;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">the curtain</span>; that is, the tent. The tabernacle prepared by Moses for the ark was formed of ten curtains (<a href="/exodus/26-1.htm">Exodus 26:1</a>), but the significance lay, not in their number, but in the dwelling of Jehovah still being a mere temporary lodging, though his people had received from him a settled land. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When the offering of sacrifice was over, David blessed the people in the name of the Lord, as Solomon did afterwards at the dedication of the temple (<a href="/1_kings/8-55.htm">1 Kings 8:55</a>), and gave to all the (assembled) people, both men and women, to every one a slice of bread, a measure (of wine), and a cake for a festal meal, i.e., for the sacrificial meal, which was celebrated with the shelamim after the offering of the sacrifices, and after the king had concluded the liturgical festival with a benediction. &#1500;&#1495;&#1501; &#1495;&#1500;&#1468;&#1514; is a round cake of bread, baked for sacrificial meals, and synonymous with &#1499;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1470;&#1500;&#1495;&#1501;   (<a href="/1_chronicles/16-3.htm">1 Chronicles 16:3</a>), as we may see from a comparison of <a href="/exodus/29-23.htm">Exodus 29:23</a> with <a href="/leviticus/8-26.htm">Leviticus 8:26</a> (see the commentary on <a href="/leviticus/8-2.htm">Leviticus 8:2</a>).

Most of the Rabbins understand it as signifying a piece of flesh or roast meat, deriving the word from &#1488;&#1513;&#1473; and &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;; but this is certainly false. There is more to be said in favour of the derivation proposed by L. de Dieu, viz., from the Ethiopic &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1512;, netiri, from which Gesenius and Roediger (Ges. Thes. p. 1470) have drawn their explanation of the word as signifying a measure of wine or other beverage. For &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;, the meaning grape-cake or raisin-cake is established by Son of Sol 2:5 and <a href="/hosea/3-1.htm">Hosea 3:1</a> (vid., Hengstenberg, Christol. on <a href="/hosea/3-1.htm">Hosea 3:1</a>). The people returned home after the festal meal. </body></html>
