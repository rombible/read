He had low thoughts of his own merits. All we have, must be looked upon as Divine gifts. He speaks very highly and honourably of the Lord's favours to him. Considering what the character and condition of man is, we may be amazed that God should deal with him as he does. The promise of Christ includes all; if the Lord God be ours, what more can we ask, or think of? Eph 3:20. He knows us better than we know ourselves; therefore let us be satisfied with what he has done for us. What can we say more for ourselves in our prayers, than God has said for us in his promises? David ascribes all to the free grace of God. Both the great things He had done for him, and the great things He had made known to him. All was for his word's sake, that is, for the sake of Christ the eternal Word. Many, when they go to pray, have their hearts to seek, but David's heart was found, that is, it was fixed; gathered in from its wanderings, entirely engaged to the duty, and employed in it. That prayer which is from the tongue only, will not please God; it must be found in the heart; that must be lifted up and poured out before God. He builds his faith, and hopes to speed, upon the sureness of God's promise. David prays for the performance of the promise. With God, saying and doing are not two things, as they often are with men; God will do as he hath said. The promises of God are not made to us by name, as to David, but they belong to all who believe in Jesus Christ, and plead them in his name.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The nations and their gods - i e. the people and the idols of Canaan. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20. what can David say more unto thee?&#8212;that is, my obligations are greater than I can express.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Thou hast confirmed to thyself; </span> partly by thy promises, and that sure covenant which thou hast made with them; and partly by thy glorious works wrought on their behalf, as it appears this day. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Thou art become their God, </span> in a peculiar manner, and by special relation and covenant; for otherwise he is <span class="ital">the God and Father of all things</span>, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/1_corinthians/8-6.htm" title="But to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him.">1 Corinthians 8:6</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For thou hast confirmed to thyself thy people Israel to be a people unto thee for ever,....

This plainly refers to [he settlement in Canaan, now at last completed by David's victories, and not to the deliverance from Egypt. In the words that follow David recognizes the spiritual importance, not only of the permanent continuance of his house, but also of the empire given unto him. For Israel is now to be <span class="cmt_word">a people forever: and thou, Jehovah, art become their God.</span> It is very necessary to retain here the personal name, Jehovah, as it is in the Hebrew, and not dilute it down to the <span class="accented">Lord</span> of the Septuagint. For now, to David's mind, the covenant seemed complete, and ratified forever. Israel is to have an everlasting existence - a promise belonging to it in its full sense only spiritually. For as long as the world lasts, it is against the spiritual Israel that the gates of hell shall never prevail. And next, first as the theocratic people, and then as the Church, it is to hold a unique relation to Jehovah, who is to be its God. For Israel, that is, the Jewish and the Christian Church, worships, not the God of nature, <span class="accented">Elohim</span>, but <span class="accented">Jehovah</span>, the God of grace; and they learn his attributes, not from philosophy, nor by metaphysical inquiry, but from his own revealed will, in which he teaches us what he is, what we are, and how we are to become one with him. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>David's prayer and thanksgiving. - <a href="/2_samuel/7-18.htm">2 Samuel 7:18</a>. King David came, i.e., went into the sanctuary erected upon Zion, and remained before Jehovah. &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;, remained, tarried (as in <a href="/genesis/24-55.htm">Genesis 24:55</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/29-19.htm">Genesis 29:19</a>, etc.), not "sat;" for the custom of sitting before the Lord in the sanctuary, as the posture assumed in prayer, cannot be deduced from <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/17-12.htm">Exodus 17:12</a>, where Moses is compelled to sit from simple exhaustion. David's prayer consists of two parts - thanksgiving for the promise (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-18.htm">2 Samuel 7:18-24</a>), and supplication for its fulfilment (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-25.htm">2 Samuel 7:25-29</a>). The thanksgiving consists of a confession of unworthiness of all the great things that the Lord had hitherto done for him, and which He had still further increased by this glorious promise (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-18.htm">2 Samuel 7:18-21</a>), and praise to the Lord that all this had been done in proof of His true Deity, and to glorify His name upon His chosen people Israel.<p><a href="/2_samuel/7-18.htm">2 Samuel 7:18</a>. "Who am I, O Lord Jehovah? and who my house (i.e., my family), that Thou hast brought me hitherto?" These words recall Jacob's prayer in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/32-10.htm">Genesis 32:10</a>, "I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies," etc. David acknowledged himself to be unworthy of the great mercy which the Lord had displayed towards him, that he might give the glory to God alone (vid., <a href="/psalms/8-5.htm">Psalm 8:5</a> and <a href="/psalms/144-3.htm">Psalm 144:3</a>).</body></html>
