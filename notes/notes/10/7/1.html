At what period of his reign David formed this resolution to build a temple cannot be exactly determined. On the one hand the emphatic words “when the Lord had given him rest round about from all his enemies” (cp. <span class="ital"><a href="/2_samuel/7-9.htm" title="And I was with you wherever you went, and have cut off all your enemies out of your sight, and have made you a great name, like to the name of the great men that are in the earth.">2 Samuel 7:9</a></span>) seem to point to a time after some at least of the wars recorded in ch. 8. On the other hand it was before the birth of Solomon (<span class="ital"><a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm" title="And when your days be fulfilled, and you shall sleep with your fathers, I will set up your seed after you, which shall proceed out of your bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.">2 Samuel 7:12</a></span>), and so cannot be placed in the latter years of his reign. The arrangement of the book is not strictly chronological, and this narrative finds a most suitable place here from its close connexion with the subject of the preceding chapter.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When the king sat in his house.</span> The order is not chronological; for the words, <span class="cmt_word">Jehovah had given him rest from all his enemies round about</span> (so the Revised Version, rightly), imply the successful termination, not of all wars necessarily, but certainly of something more than that with the Philistine invaders in the Rephaim valley. A general summary of all David's wars is given in ch. 8, and it was probably after he had subdued the Philistines and Moab, and his throne was now fully established, that in some time of peace, possibly before Hanun forced him into wars which won for him an empire, David sent for Nathan, and told him his full desire. Its position here immediately after the account of the bringing of the ark to Zion has a higher unity than that of chronology. It shows that David had always a larger purpose than the mere placing of the ark in its feint; and, as soon as a period of tranquillity arrived, he confided his thoughts to the prophet. Thus, with only one step taken towards his whole plan, David exercised a wise moderation in leaving the service at Gibeon unmolested. As regards the word "rest," we have to distinguish between the first series of wars, which established David firmly on his throne, and the second series, which gave him widespread dominion. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When the offering of sacrifice was over, David blessed the people in the name of the Lord, as Solomon did afterwards at the dedication of the temple (<a href="/1_kings/8-55.htm">1 Kings 8:55</a>), and gave to all the (assembled) people, both men and women, to every one a slice of bread, a measure (of wine), and a cake for a festal meal, i.e., for the sacrificial meal, which was celebrated with the shelamim after the offering of the sacrifices, and after the king had concluded the liturgical festival with a benediction. &#1500;&#1495;&#1501; &#1495;&#1500;&#1468;&#1514; is a round cake of bread, baked for sacrificial meals, and synonymous with &#1499;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1470;&#1500;&#1495;&#1501;   (<a href="/1_chronicles/16-3.htm">1 Chronicles 16:3</a>), as we may see from a comparison of <a href="/exodus/29-23.htm">Exodus 29:23</a> with <a href="/leviticus/8-26.htm">Leviticus 8:26</a> (see the commentary on <a href="/leviticus/8-2.htm">Leviticus 8:2</a>).

Most of the Rabbins understand it as signifying a piece of flesh or roast meat, deriving the word from &#1488;&#1513;&#1473; and &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;; but this is certainly false. There is more to be said in favour of the derivation proposed by L. de Dieu, viz., from the Ethiopic &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1512;, netiri, from which Gesenius and Roediger (Ges. Thes. p. 1470) have drawn their explanation of the word as signifying a measure of wine or other beverage. For &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;, the meaning grape-cake or raisin-cake is established by Son of Sol 2:5 and <a href="/hosea/3-1.htm">Hosea 3:1</a> (vid., Hengstenberg, Christol. on <a href="/hosea/3-1.htm">Hosea 3:1</a>). The people returned home after the festal meal. </body></html>
