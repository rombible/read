David does not commend Saul for what he was not; and says nothing of his piety or goodness. Jonathan was a dutiful son, Saul an affectionate father, therefore dear to each other. David had reason to say, that Jonathan's love to him was wonderful. Next to the love between Christ and his people, that affection which springs form it, produces the strongest friendship. The trouble of the Lord's people, and triumphs of his enemies, will always grieve true believers, whatever advantages they may obtain by them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>True friendship, founded on sincere love, so rare, so difficult to be found, so little known among the gay and the great, is one of the richest of Heaven's blessings to man, and when enjoyed, should be regarded as more than a compensation for all of show, and splendor, and flattery that wealth can obtain.<p>"Though choice of follies fasten on the great,<p>None clings more obstinate, than fancy fond.<p>That sacred friendship is their easy prey;<p>Caught by the wafture of a golden lure,<p>Or fascination of a high-born smile.<p>Their smiles, the great, and the coquette, throw out.<p>For other's hearts, tenacious of their own,<p>And we no less of ours, when such the bait,<p>Ye fortune's cofferers? ye powers of wealth!<p>Can gold gain friendship!

Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with other delights, &c.&#8212;The fondness for dress, which anciently distinguished Oriental women, is their characteristic still. It appears in their love of bright, gay, and divers colors, in profuse display of ornaments, and in various other forms. The inmost depths of the poet's feeling are stirred, and his amiable disposition appears in the strong desire to celebrate the good qualities of Saul, as well as Jonathan. But the praises of the latter form the burden of the poem, which begins and ends with that excellent prince.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

But not only is there in David’s lament no revengeful feeling at the death of his persecutor.… but he dwells with unmixed love on the brighter recollections of the departed. He speaks only of the Saul of earlier times, the mighty conqueror, the delight of his people, the father of his beloved and faithful friend; like him in life, united with him in death. Such expressions … may fairly be taken as justifying the irrepressible instinct of humanity which compels us to dwell on the best qualities of those who have just departed.” Stanley, <span class="ital">Lect.</span> II. 30.

Glorious and noble in their pest lives, the heroes had now fallen, not as Wolfe fell at Quebec, with the shout of victory in his ears, but in the lost battle. And David seeks relief for his distress in dwelling upon the sad contrast between the splendid victories which Saul had won for Israel when first chosen to be king, and the terrible defeat by which life and kingdom had now been lost. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Even nature is to join in the mourning. May God withdraw His blessing from the mountains upon which the heroes have fallen, that they may not be moistened by the dew and rain of heaven, but, remaining in eternal barrenness, be memorials of the horrible occurrence that has taken place upon them. &#1489;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506; &#1492;&#1512;&#1497; is an address to them; and the preposition &#1489;&#1468; with the construct state is poetical: "mountains in Gilboa" (vid., Ewald, 289, b.). In &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501; ... &#1488;&#1500; the verb &#1497;&#1492;&#1497; is wanting. The following words, &#1514;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; &#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1491;&#1497;, are in apposition to the foregoing: "and let not fields of first-fruit offerings be upon you," i.e., fields producing fruit, from which offerings of first-fruits were presented. This is the simplest and most appropriate explanation of the words, which have been very differently, and in some respects very marvellously rendered. The reason for this cursing of the mountains of Gilboa was, that there the shield of the heroes, particularly of Saul, had been defiled with blood, namely the blood of those whom the shield ought to defend. &#1490;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500; does not mean to throw away (Dietrich. ), but to soil or defile (as in the Chaldee), then to abhor. "Not anointed with oil," i.e., not cleansed and polished with oil, so that the marks of Saul's blood still adhered to it. &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497; poetical for &#1500;&#1488;. The interpolation of the words "as though" (quasi non esset unctus oleo, Vulgate) cannot be sustained. </body></html>
