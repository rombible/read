O Jonathan, you were slain in your high places....">2 Samuel 1:25-27</a></span>. <span class="ital">O Jonathan, slain in thy high places </span>— He says <span class="ital">thy, </span>for they were in Jonathan’s country; and, had not his father disinherited him by his sins, in his dominions. Thus David’s grief, which began with Jonathan, naturally ends with him. It is well known that we lament ourselves in the loss of our friends; and David was no way solicitous to conceal this circumstance. <span class="ital">I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan — </span>In the former part of this lamentation David celebrates Jonathan as a brave man, in the latter he laments him as a friend. And in this respect he had certainly as great obligations to him as ever man had to another. For, as he here observes, Jonathan’s love to him was indeed wonderful, passing the love of women. <span class="ital">And the weapons of war perished — </span>All military glory gone from Israel! “It may be the work of fancy in me,” says Dr. Delaney, “but to me, I own, this last stanza is the strongest picture of grief I ever perused. To my ear every line in it is either swelled with sighs, or broken with sobs. The judicious reader will find a break in the first line of it, very probably so left in the original, the writer not being able to find an epithet for Jonathan answering to the idea of his distress.” Our translators have supplied the interjection <span class="ital">O! O Jonathan, stabbed in thy high places! </span>“To conclude: Few have ever perused this lamentation with so little attention as not to perceive it evidently animated with a spirit truly martial and magnanimous! It is the lamentation of a brave man over brave men. It is, in one word, a lamentation equally pathetic and heroic. To this may be added, it is not less generous. For in the most noble spirit David passes over in entire silence all the ill-treatment which he, and his friend Jonathan on his account, had received from Saul; he does not make the most distant allusion to it, but seems through the whole song to strive to conceal every thing that might cast any reflection upon him.” The lines we promised are as follows: —<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><span class="ital">“Mid the throng’d phalanx, where the battle press’d, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The bow of Jonathan, infuriate, burn’d; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Nor e’er, from slaughter’s sanguinary feast, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The sword of Saul unsatiated return’d!</span></span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><span class="ital">All eyes, all hearts, admired the lovely pair, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The princely parent and the pious son; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Whom life united, not divided are <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In death, whose dire catastrophe is one.</span></span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><span class="ital">With rapid pinion through th’ aerial plain <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The lightning eagle flies, but swifter they; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Strong is the monarch of the wood’s domain, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But more their might indignant o’er the prey.</span></span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ye weeping nymphs, attune the mourning lyre <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>To solemn strains of sympathetic wo; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Daughters of Israel, who the brave admire, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Bid for the brave the lay funereal flow!</span></span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><span class="ital">‘Twas Saul returning from the battle’s toils, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Triumphant chief! amidst his warriors bold, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Who crown’d your beauties with Philistia’s spoils, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Who deck’d your charms with diamonds and gold,”</span></span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">For the rest, see the Arminian Magazine for June </span>1811. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:17-27 Kasheth, or the bow, probably was the title of this mournful, funeral song. David does not commend Saul for what he was not; and says nothing of his piety or goodness. Jonathan was a dutiful son, Saul an affectionate father, therefore dear to each other. David had reason to say, that Jonathan's love to him was wonderful. Next to the love between Christ and his people, that affection which springs form it, produces the strongest friendship. The trouble of the Lord's people, and triumphs of his enemies, will always grieve true believers, whatever advantages they may obtain by them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>How are the mighty fallen - The recurrenee of the same idea <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-19.htm">2 Samuel 1:19</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-25.htm">2 Samuel 1:25</a>, <a href="/2_samuel/1-27.htm">2 Samuel 1:27</a> is perfectly congenial to the nature of elegy, since grief is fond of dwelling upon the particular objects of the passion, and frequently repeating them. By unanimous consent this is considered one of the most beautiful odes in the Bible, and the generosity of David in thus mourning for his enemy and persecutor, Saul, enhances the effect upon the mind of the reader. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24-27. Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with other delights, &c.&#8212;The fondness for dress, which anciently distinguished Oriental women, is their characteristic still. It appears in their love of bright, gay, and divers colors, in profuse display of ornaments, and in various other forms. The inmost depths of the poet's feeling are stirred, and his amiable disposition appears in the strong desire to celebrate the good qualities of Saul, as well as Jonathan. But the praises of the latter form the burden of the poem, which begins and ends with that excellent prince.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Which were in thy country, </span> and (had not thy father disinherited thee by his sins) in thy dominions. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle!....

The second commemorates the friendship between David and Jonathan. The third simply utters the last sigh, with which the elegy becomes silent. The first strophe runs thus:<p>19  The ornament, O Israel, is slain upon thy heights!<p>Oh how are the mighty fallen!<p>20  Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Askelon;<p>Lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice,<p>Lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph!<p>21  Ye mountains of Gilboa, let now dew or rain be upon you, or fields of first-fruit offerings:<p>For there is the shield of the mighty defiled,<p>The shield of Saul, not anointed with oil.<p>22  From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty,<p>The bow of Jonathan turned not back,<p>And the sword of Saul returned not empty.<p>23  Saul and Jonathan, beloved and kind, in life<p>And in death they are not divided.<p>continued...</body></html>
