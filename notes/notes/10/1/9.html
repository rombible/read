David's question, "How went the matter?" evinces the deep interest he took in the war, an interest that sprang from feelings of high and generous patriotism, not from views of ambition. The Amalekite, however, judging him to be actuated by a selfish principle, fabricated a story improbable and inconsistent, which he thought would procure him a reward. Having probably witnessed the suicidal act of Saul, he thought of turning it to his own account, and suffered the penalty of his grievously mistaken calculation (compare 2Sa 1:9 with 1Sa 31:4, 5).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Stand upon me, </span> i.e. lean upon me by thy weight and force, that the spear may come through me; or, <span class="ital">stay by me</span>, i.e. stop thy flight, and tarry so long with me till thou hast killed me. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Anguish is come upon me, </span> i.e. I am in great pain of body, and anguish of mind.

Which it can hardly be thought Saul would say; since he might as well have died by the hands of the uncircumcised Philistines, which he endeavoured to avoid, as by the hands of an Amalekite: <p>for anguish is come upon me; or trembling, as the Targum, not through fear of death, but through fear of falling into the hands of the Philistines, and of being ill used by them. Some render the words, "my embroidered coat", or "breastplate", or "coat of mail", holds me (g), or hinders me from being pierced through with the sword or spear; so Ben Gersom (h): <p>because my life is yet whole in me: for though he had been wounded by the archers, yet he did not apprehend he had received any mortal wound, but his life was whole in him; and therefore feared he should fall into their hands alive, and be ill treated by them. <p>(g) "tunica scutulata", Braunius; "ocellata chlamys", Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator; "thorax villosus seu pelliceus", Texelii Phoenix, p. 210.

He feared that he might fall alive into the hands of the Philistines. Cp. <a href="/1_samuel/31-4.htm" title="Then said Saul to his armor bearer, Draw your sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and abuse me. But his armor bearer would not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took a sword, and fell on it.">1 Samuel 31:4</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Anguish</span>. This word, which occurs only in this place, comes from a root signifying to entwine or knot together. On this account Jewish commentators explain it of cramp, which often follows upon loss of blood; but it is equally possible that it means vertigo, or giddiness, when things seem to dance or interweave themselves together before the eyes. The next words signify, <span class="cmt_word">For yet is my life whole within me,</span> and give the reason why Saul asked the Amalekite to slay him. The story is at least plausible. It represents the king as deserted by his army, even to the last man, and with the Philistine cavalry and chariots in close pursuit. He is not mortally wounded, but, as giddiness prevents his escape, there is danger of his falling alive into the enemy's hand; and as they would probably not have killed him, but carried him in triumph through their cities, the way would still have been blocked against David's succession. The fear of this indignity would account for Saul's earnest appeal to the Amalekite to slay him, and, so requested, it seemed right to put him to death, instead of trying to carry him off to a place of safety. But all this was merely to keep up appearances, and in his heart he doubted not that David would regard it as a signal service that his enemy was put out of the way. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>David receives the news of Saul's death. - <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-1.htm">2 Samuel 1:1-4</a>. After the death of Saul, and David's return to Ziklag from his campaign against the Amalekites, there came a man to David on the third day, with his clothes torn and earth strewed upon his head (as a sign of deep mourning: see at <a href="/1_samuel/4-12.htm">1 Samuel 4:12</a>), who informed him of the flight and overthrow of the Israelitish army, and the death of Saul and Jonathan.<p><a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-1.htm">2 Samuel 1:1-3</a><p><a href="/2_samuel/1-1.htm">2 Samuel 1:1</a> may be regarded as the protasis to <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-2.htm">2 Samuel 1:2</a>, so far as the contents are concerned, although formally it is rounded off, and &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; forms the apodosis to &#1493;&#1497;&#1492;&#1497;: "It came to pass after the death of Saul, David had returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-1.htm">1 Samuel 30:1-26</a>), that David remained at Ziklag two days. And it came to pass on the third day," etc. Both of these notices of the time refer to the day, on which David returned to Ziklag from the pursuit and defeat of the Amalekites. Whether the battle at Gilboa, in which Saul fell, occurred before or after the return of David, it is impossible to determine. All that follows from the juxtaposition of the two events in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-1.htm">2 Samuel 1:1</a>, is that they were nearly contemporaneous. The man "came from the army from with Saul," and therefore appears to have kept near to Saul during the battle.</body></html>
