David does not commend Saul for what he was not; and says nothing of his piety or goodness. Jonathan was a dutiful son, Saul an affectionate father, therefore dear to each other. David had reason to say, that Jonathan's love to him was wonderful. Next to the love between Christ and his people, that affection which springs form it, produces the strongest friendship.

Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with other delights, &c.&#8212;The fondness for dress, which anciently distinguished Oriental women, is their characteristic still. It appears in their love of bright, gay, and divers colors, in profuse display of ornaments, and in various other forms. The inmost depths of the poet's feeling are stirred, and his amiable disposition appears in the strong desire to celebrate the good qualities of Saul, as well as Jonathan. But the praises of the latter form the burden of the poem, which begins and ends with that excellent prince.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Ye daughters of Israel:</span> these he mentions, partly because the women then used to make songs, both of triumph and of lamentation, as occasion required; and partly because they usually are most delighted with the ornaments of the body here following. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Who clotheth you in scarlet:</span> this he did, partly because he procured them so much peace as gave them opportunity of enriching themselves; and partly because he took these things as spoils from the enemies, and clothed his own people with them.

This incidental mention indicates how much Saul’s successful wars, so briefly alluded to in the history of his reign (<a href="/1_samuel/14-47.htm" title="So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines: and wherever he turned himself, he vexed them.">1 Samuel 14:47</a>), had enriched the nation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">with</span> other <span class="ital">delights</span>] A possible rendering: but <span class="ital">with delights</span> perhaps rather means <span class="ital">delicately</span> or <span class="ital">richly</span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye daughters of Israel.</span> In old time, the women of Israel had celebrated Saul's triumphs (ver. 20), but now it is their sad office to bewail his death. And a touching reason is given for their sorrow. During Saul's reign the condition of the women had greatly improved. When a nation is in the miserable plight described in <a href="/1_samuel/13-19.htm">1 Samuel 13:19-22</a>, there is neither safety nor comfort for the weak; but when the strong arm of Saul had won freedom for Israel, the women were the first to reap the benefit, and "their scarlet clothing with delights," that is, their delightful or delicate clothing of bright colours and their golden ornaments, prove that the nation had made a great advance in prosperity and culture during the happier years of Saul's reign. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>David's elegy upon Saul and Jonathan. - An eloquent testimony to the depth and sincerity of David's grief for the death of Saul is handed down to us in the elegy which he composed upon Saul and his noble son Jonathan, and which he had taught to the children of Israel. It is one of the finest odes of the Old Testament; full of lofty sentiment, and springing from deep and sanctified emotion, in which, without the slightest allusion to his own relation to the fallen king, David celebrates without envy the bravery and virtues of Saul and his son Jonathan, and bitterly laments their loss. "He said to teach," i.e., he commanded the children of Judah to practise or learn it. &#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;, bow; i.e., a song to which the title Kesheth or bow was given, not only because the bow is referred to (<a href="/2_samuel/1-22.htm">2 Samuel 1:22</a>), but because it is a martial ode, and the bow was one of the principal weapons used by the warriors of that age, and one in the use of which the Benjaminites, the tribe-mates of Saul, were particularly skilful: cf. <a href="/1_chronicles/8-40.htm">1 Chronicles 8:40</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/12-2.htm">1 Chronicles 12:2</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/14-7.htm">2 Chronicles 14:7</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/17-17.htm">2 Chronicles 17:17</a>. Other explanations are by no means so natural; such, for example, as that it related to the melody to which the ode was sung; whilst some are founded upon false renderings, or arbitrary alterations of the text, e.g., that of Ewald (Gesch. i. p. 41), Thenius, etc. This elegy was inserted in "the book of the righteous" (see at <a href="/joshua/10-13.htm">Joshua 10:13</a>), from which the author of the books of Samuel has taken it. </body></html>
