He certainly here claims to have been a part of the “camp of Israel.” He tells David the general facts of the defeat, and the death of Saul and Jonathan, as they really occurred.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:1-10 The blow which opened David's way to the throne was given about the time he had been sorely distressed.

David's question, "How went the matter?" evinces the deep interest he took in the war, an interest that sprang from feelings of high and generous patriotism, not from views of ambition. The Amalekite, however, judging him to be actuated by a selfish principle, fabricated a story improbable and inconsistent, which he thought would procure him a reward. Having probably witnessed the suicidal act of Saul, he thought of turning it to his own account, and suffered the penalty of his grievously mistaken calculation (compare 2Sa 1:9 with 1Sa 31:4, 5).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And David said unto him, from whence comest thou?....

But for an active young man the opportunity would then have come for booty. The Philistines, in pursuit of the enemy, would soon leave the battlefield in their rear, and multitudes would quickly prowl about it to plunder the dead. While so busied, the Amalekite falsely represents himself as having come by chance upon the wounded, but still living, Saul. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/31.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>On the day following the battle, when the Philistines tripped the slain, they found Saul and his three sons lying upon Gilboa; and having cut off their heads and plundered their weapons, they went them (the heads and weapons) as trophies into the land of the Philistines, i.e., round about to the different towns and hamlets of their land, to announce the joyful news in their idol-temples (the writer of the Chronicles mentions the idols themselves) and to the people, and then deposited their weapons (the weapons of Saul and his sons) in the Astarte-houses. But the corpses they fastened to the town-wall of Beth-shean, i.e., Beisan, in the valley of the Jordan (see at <a href="/joshua/17-11.htm">Joshua 17:11</a>). Beth-azabbim and Beth-ashtaroth are composite words; the first part is indeclinable, and the plural form is expressed by the second word: idol-houses and Astarte-houses, like beth-aboth (father's-houses: see at <a href="/exodus/6-14.htm">Exodus 6:14</a>). On the Astartes, see at <a href="/judges/2-13.htm">Judges 2:13</a>. It is not expressly stated indeed in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-9.htm">1 Samuel 31:9</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-10.htm">1 Samuel 31:10</a>, that the Philistines plundered the bodies of Saul's sons as well, and mutilated them by cutting off their heads; but &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493; and &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;, his (i.e., Saul's) head and his weapons, alone are mentioned. At the same time, it is every evident from <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-12.htm">1 Samuel 31:12</a>, where the Jabeshites are said to have taken down from the wall of Beth-shean not Saul's body only, but the bodies of his sons also, that the Philistines had treated the corpses of Saul's sons in just the same manner as that of Saul himself. The writer speaks distinctly of the abuse of Saul's body only, because it was his death that he had chiefly in mind at the time. To the word &#1493;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468; we must supply in thought the object &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493; and &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; from the preceding clause. &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1514; and &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1514; (<a href="/1_samuel/31-10.htm">1 Samuel 31:10</a> and <a href="/1_samuel/31-12.htm">1 Samuel 31:12</a>) are the corpses without the heads. The fact that the Philistines nailed them to the town-wall of Beth-shean presupposes the capture of that city, from which it is evident that they had occupied the land as far as the Jordan. The definite word Beth-ashtaroth is changed by the writer of the Chronicles into Beth-elohim, temples of the gods; or rather he has interpreted it in this manner without altering the sense, as the Astartes are merely mentioned as the principal deities for the idols generally. The writer of the Chronicles has also omitted to mention the nailing of the corpses to the wall of Beth-shean, but he states instead that "they fastened his skull in the temple of Dagon," a fact which is passed over in the account before us. From this we may see how both writers have restricted themselves to the principal points, or those which appeared to them of the greatest importance (vid., Bertheau on <a href="/1_chronicles/10-10.htm">1 Chronicles 10:10</a>). </body></html>
