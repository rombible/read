It does not matter whether he fully believed his story or not, the man must be judged by his own account of himself. (See <a href="/2_samuel/1-16.htm" title="And David said to him, Your blood be on your head; for your mouth has testified against you, saying, I have slain the LORD's anointed.">2Samuel 1:16</a>.) Regicide was not in David’s eyes merely a political crime; he had showed on more than one occasion of great temptation (<a href="/1_samuel/24-6.htm" title="And he said to his men, The LORD forbid that I should do this thing to my master, the LORD's anointed, to stretch forth my hand against him, seeing he is the anointed of the LORD.">1Samuel 24:6</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/26-9.htm" title="And David said to Abishai, Destroy him not: for who can stretch forth his hand against the LORD's anointed, and be guiltless?">1Samuel 26:9</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/26-11.htm" title="The LORD forbid that I should stretch forth my hand against the LORD's anointed: but, I pray you, take you now the spear that is at his bolster, and the cruse of water, and let us go.">1Samuel 26:11</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/26-16.htm" title="This thing is not good that you have done. As the LORD lives, you are worthy to die, because you have not kept your master, the LORD's anointed. And now see where the king's spear is, and the cruse of water that was at his bolster.">1Samuel 26:16</a>) that he considered taking the life of “the Lord’s anointed” as a religious offence of the greatest magnitude. It was an especially grievous thing for a foreigner and an Amalekite thus to smite him whom God had appointed as the monarch of Israel.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:11-16 David was sincere in his mourning for Saul; and all with him humbled themselves under the hand of God, laid so heavily upon Israel by this defeat. The man who brought the tidings, David put to death, as a murderer of his prince. David herein did not do unjustly; the Amalekite confessed the crime. If he did as he said, he deserved to die for treason; and his lying to David, if indeed it were a lie, proved, as sooner or later that sin will prove, lying against himself. Hereby David showed himself zealous for public justice, without regard to his own private interest.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Whether David believed the Amalekite's story, or not, his anger was equally excited, and the fact that the young man was an Amalekite, was not calculated to calm or check it. That David's temper was hasty, we know from <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-13.htm">1 Samuel 25:13</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-32.htm">1 Samuel 25:32-34</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13-15. David said unto the young man &#8230; Whence art thou?&#8212;The man had at the outset stated who he was. But the question was now formally and judicially put. The punishment inflicted on the Amalekite may seem too severe, but the respect paid to kings in the West must not be regarded as the standard for that which the East may think due to royal station. David's reverence for Saul, as the Lord's anointed, was in his mind a principle on which he had faithfully acted on several occasions of great temptation. In present circumstances it was especially important that his principle should be publicly known; and to free himself from the imputation of being in any way accessory to the execrable crime of regicide was the part of a righteous judge, no less than of a good politician.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Why didst not thou refuse to kill him, as his armour-bearer had done?

But his armor bearer would not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took a sword, and fell on it.">1 Samuel 31:4</a>.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>To David's further inquiry how he knew this, the young man replied (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-6.htm">2 Samuel 1:6-10</a>), "I happened to come (&#1504;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488;  equals  &#1504;&#1511;&#1512;&#1492;) up to the mountains of Gilboa, and saw Saul leaning upon his spear; then the chariots (the war-chariots for the charioteers) and riders were pressing upon him, and he turned round and saw me, ... and asked me, Who art thou? and I said, An Amalekite; and he said to me, Come hither to me, and slay me, for the cramp (&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1509; according to the Rabbins) hath seized me (sc., so that I cannot defend myself, and must fall into the hands of the Philistines); for my soul (my life) is still whole in me. Then I went to him, and slew him, because I knew that after his fall he would not live; and took the crown upon his head, and the bracelet upon his arm, and brought them to my lord" (David). "After his fall" does not mean "after he had fallen upon his sword or spear" (Clericus), for this is neither implied in &#1504;&#1508;&#1500;&#1493; nor in &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1495;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514;&#1493; &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1503; ("supported, i.e., leaning upon his spear"), nor are we at liberty to transfer it from <a href="/1_samuel/31-4.htm">1 Samuel 31:4</a> into this passage; but "after his defeat," i.e., so that he would not survive this calamity. This statement is at variance with the account of the death of Saul in <a href="/1_samuel/31-3.htm">1 Samuel 31:3</a>.; and even apart from this it has an air of improbability, or rather of untruth in it, particularly in the assertion that Saul was leaning upon his spear when the chariots and horsemen of the enemy came upon him, without having either an armour-bearer or any other Israelitish soldier by his side, so that he had to turn to an Amalekite who accidentally came by, and to ask him to inflict the fatal wound. The Amalekite invented this, in the hope of thereby obtaining the better recompense from David. The only part of his statement which is certainly true, is that he found the king lying dead upon the field of battle, and took off the crown and armlet; since he brought these to David. But it is by no means certain whether he was present when Saul expired, or merely found him after he was dead.</body></html>
