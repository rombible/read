David does not commend Saul for what he was not; and says nothing of his piety or goodness. Jonathan was a dutiful son, Saul an affectionate father, therefore dear to each other. David had reason to say, that Jonathan's love to him was wonderful. Next to the love between Christ and his people, that affection which springs form it, produces the strongest friendship.

"The bow" is the name by which this dirge was known, being so called from the mention of Jonathan's bow in <a href="/2_samuel/1-22.htm">2 Samuel 1:22</a>. The sense would then be: And he commanded them to teach the children of Israel the song called Kasheth (the bow), i. e. he gave directions that the song should be learned by heart (compare <a href="/deuteronomy/31-19.htm">Deuteronomy 31:19</a>). It has been further suggested that in the Book of Jasher there was, among other things, a collection of poems, in which special mention was made of the bow.

David Laments Saul and Jonathan.<p>17, 18. David lamented with this lamentation&#8212;It has always been customary for Eastern people, on the death of great kings and warriors, to celebrate their qualities and deeds in funeral songs. This inimitable pathetic elegy is supposed by many writers to have become a national war song, and to have been taught to the young Israelites under the name of "The Bow," in conformity with the practice of Hebrew and many classical writers in giving titles to their songs from the principal theme (Ps 22:1; 56:1; 60:1; 80:1; 100:1). Although the words "the use of" are a supplement by our translators, they may be rightly introduced, for the natural sense of this parenthetical verse is, that David took immediate measures for instructing the people in the knowledge and practice of archery, their great inferiority to the enemy in this military arm having been the main cause of the late national disaster.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Also: having mentioned David’s lamentation in general, before he comes to the particular description of it, he interposeth this verse by way of parenthesis; to signify, that David did not so give up himself to lamentation as to neglect his great business, the care of the commonwealth, which now lay upon him; but took particular care to fortify them against such further losses and calamities as he bewails in the following song; and by his example, and this counsel, to instruct the people, that they should not give up themselves to sorrow and despondency for their great and general loss; but should raise up their spirits, and betake themselves to action. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">He bade them:</span> David being now actually king upon Saul’s death, takes his power upon him, and gives forth his commands. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The children of Judah:</span> these he more particularly teacheth, because they were the chief, and now the royal tribe, and likely to be the great bulwark to all Israel against the Philistines, upon whose land they bordered; and withal, to be the most friendly and true to him, and to his interest. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The use of the bow, </span> i. e. the use of their arms, which are all synecdochically expressed under the name of the <span class="ital">bow</span>, which then was one of the chief weapons; and for the dexterous use whereof Jonathan is commended in the following song: which may be one reason why he now gives forth this order, that so they might strive to imitate Jonathan in the military skill, and to excel in it, as he did. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">It is written; </span> not the following song, as many think, for that is written here, and therefore it was needless to refer us to another book for it; but this foregoing counsel and course which David took to repair the last loss, which is here mentioned but briefly, and in general terms; but, as it seems, more largely and particularly described <span class="ital">in the book of Jasher</span>; of which see on <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/joshua/10-13.htm" title="And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people had avenged themselves on their enemies.

These words, with what follow in this verse, are rightly put into a parenthesis, since they do not begin nor make any part of the elegiac song, or lamentation of David; and are here inserted to show, that, amidst his sorrow and lamentation, he was not unmindful of the welfare of the people, and to provide for their defence and security; and therefore gave orders that care should be taken, especially in the tribe of Judah, which was his own tribe, and where he had the greatest authority, and for whom he might have the chiefest concern, that they should be trained up in military exercises, learn the art of war, and the use of every weapon of war, particularly of the bow, which, being a principal one, may be put for all; and which may be the rather mentioned, because the Philistines were expert in the use of it, and seemed to have done much execution with it in the recent battle, see <a href="/1_samuel/31-3.htm">1 Samuel 31:3</a>. They are said (p) to be the inventors of it; though Pliny (q) ascribes it to others; and it may be the people of Israel and of Judah had of late neglected to learn the use of it, and to make use of it, and instead of that had taken to other sort of arms in fighting; for that that was not unknown to them, or wholly disused, is clear from this song, <a href="/2_samuel/1-22.htm">2 Samuel 1:22</a>; see also <a href="/1_chronicles/12-2.htm">1 Chronicles 12:2</a>. Moreover, as the Philistines, especially the Cherethites, were expert in archery, David found ways and means to get some of them afterwards into his service, and by whom he might improve his people in the art, see <a href="/2_samuel/8-18.htm">2 Samuel 8:18</a>; though some (r) are of opinion that the word "keshet", or bow, was the title of the following lamentation or song, taken from the mention of Jonathan's bow in it; which song the children of Judah were to be taught to sing; but then, as has been observed by some, for this there would have been no need of the following reference, since the whole this song is here recorded: <p>behold, it is written in book of Jasher); which the Targum calls the book of the law; and Jarchi and Ben Gersom restrain it to the book of Genesis, the book of the upright, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and suppose respect is had to the prophecy concerning Judah, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/49-8.htm">Genesis 49:8</a>, but Kimchi, extending it to all the five books of Moses, adds his blessing, in <a href="/deuteronomy/33-7.htm">Deuteronomy 33:7</a>. In the Arabic version it is explained of the book of Samuel, interpreted the book of songs, as if it was a collection of songs; which favours the above sense. Jerom (s) interprets it of the same book, the book of the righteous prophets, Samuel, Gad, and Nathan: hut this book seems to have been a public register or annals, in which were recorded memorable actions in any age, and had its name from the uprightness and faithfulness in which it was kept; and in this were set down the order of David for the teaching the children of Judah the use of the bow, and perhaps the method which he directed to for instruction in it; See Gill on <a href="/joshua/10-13.htm">Joshua 10:13</a>. <p>(p) Bedford's Chronology, p. 245.

Compare the direction concerning the Song of Moses (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-19.htm" title="Now therefore write you this song for you, and teach it the children of Israel: put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel.">Deuteronomy 31:19</a>), and the title of Psalms 60.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">behold</span>, it is <span class="ital">written in the book of Jasher</span>] The elegy was included in the volume known as <span class="ital">The Book of Jashar</span>, or, <span class="ital">the Upright</span>. (LXX. <span class="greekheb">βιβλίον τοῦ εὐθοῦς</span>; Vulg. <span class="ital">liber iustorum</span>.) This book is mentioned only here and in <a href="/joshua/10-13.htm" title="And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people had avenged themselves on their enemies. Is not this written in the book of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the middle of heaven, and hurried not to go down about a whole day.">Joshua 10:13</a>. “The Upright” is explained by some to mean Israel as the covenant people of God, and connected in etymology and sense with the title <span class="ital">Jeshurun</span> (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-15.htm" title="But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: you are waxen fat, you are grown thick, you are covered with fatness; then he forsook God which made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation.">Deuteronomy 32:15</a>); by others it is referred to the heroes whose praises were celebrated in the book. All that can be inferred from the references to it is that it contained a collection of ancient poems, commemorating remarkable events or great heroes of the national history: so that it formed a “book of Golden Deeds” for the instruction of posterity, a “national anthology” to which additions would be made from time to time as occasion offered.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Also he bade them teach the children of Judah</span> [the use of] <span class="cmt_word">the bow.</span> The old view is that given by the inserted words, and is well put by Ephrem Syrus in his  commentary upon the passage. He says that, as Israel's defeat at Gilboa was the presage of a long struggle, and as the Philistines had gained the victory there by their skill in archery, David used his utmost authority with his own tribe to get them to practise this art for their protection in future wars. This explanation would be plausible were it not that we have reason for believing that the Israelites were already skilful in the use both of the sling and the bow, in both of which the Benjamites especially excelled (<a href="/1_chronicles/12-2.htm">1 Chronicles 12:2</a>). The modern view is that given in the Revised Version, where the inserted words are "the song of" the bow. "The Bow" is thus the name of the elegy, taken from the allusion to Jonathan's skill in the use of that weapon (ver. 22; comp. <a href="/1_samuel/18-4.htm">1 Samuel 18:4</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/20-36.htm">1 Samuel 20:36</a>); and the meaning is that David made his own tribesmen, who were probably ill disposed to Saul and his family, learn this dirge, not so much for its preservation, as to make them give the fallen king due honour. Similarly <a href="/exodus/3.htm">Exodus 3</a>. is called "The Bush" in <a href="/mark/12-26.htm">Mark 12:26</a>. <span class="cmt_word">The book of Jasher.</span> See on this book <a href="/joshua/10-13.htm">Joshua 10:13</a>, where the Syriac Version calls it "The Book of Canticles," and understands by it a collection of national ballads commemorative of the brave deeds of Israelite heroes. Jasher literally means "upright," and the Book of Jasher would be equivalent to "Hero book," the Hebrews always looking to the moral rather than the physical prowess of their great men. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>This information, the substance of which was placed beyond all doubt by the king's jewels that were brought, filled David with the deepest sorrow. As a sign of his pain he rent his clothes; and all the men with him did the same, and mourned with weeping and fasting until the evening "for Saul and for Jonathan his son, for the people of Jehovah, and for the house of Israel, because they had fallen by the sword" (i.e., in battle). "The people of Jehovah" and the "house or people of Israel" are distinguished from one another, according to the twofold attitude of Israel, which furnished a double ground for mourning. Those who had fallen were first of all members of the people of Jehovah, and secondly, fellow-countrymen. "They were therefore associated with them, both according to the flesh and according to the spirit, and for that reason they mourned the more" (Seb. Schmidt). "The only deep mourning for Saul, with the exception of that of the Jabeshites (<a href="/1_samuel/31-11.htm">1 Samuel 31:11</a>), proceeded from the man whom he had hated and persecuted for so many years even to the time of his death; just as David's successor wept over the fall of Jerusalem, even when it was about to destroy Himself" (O. v. Gerlach).</body></html>
