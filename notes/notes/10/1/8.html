David's question, "How went the matter?" evinces the deep interest he took in the war, an interest that sprang from feelings of high and generous patriotism, not from views of ambition. The Amalekite, however, judging him to be actuated by a selfish principle, fabricated a story improbable and inconsistent, which he thought would procure him a reward. Having probably witnessed the suicidal act of Saul, he thought of turning it to his own account, and suffered the penalty of his grievously mistaken calculation (compare 2Sa 1:9 with 1Sa 31:4, 5).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he said unto me, who art thou?....

After the death of Saul, and David's return to Ziklag from his campaign against the Amalekites, there came a man to David on the third day, with his clothes torn and earth strewed upon his head (as a sign of deep mourning: see at <a href="/1_samuel/4-12.htm">1 Samuel 4:12</a>), who informed him of the flight and overthrow of the Israelitish army, and the death of Saul and Jonathan.<p><a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-1.htm">2 Samuel 1:1-3</a><p><a href="/2_samuel/1-1.htm">2 Samuel 1:1</a> may be regarded as the protasis to <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-2.htm">2 Samuel 1:2</a>, so far as the contents are concerned, although formally it is rounded off, and &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; forms the apodosis to &#1493;&#1497;&#1492;&#1497;: "It came to pass after the death of Saul, David had returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-1.htm">1 Samuel 30:1-26</a>), that David remained at Ziklag two days. And it came to pass on the third day," etc. Both of these notices of the time refer to the day, on which David returned to Ziklag from the pursuit and defeat of the Amalekites. Whether the battle at Gilboa, in which Saul fell, occurred before or after the return of David, it is impossible to determine. All that follows from the juxtaposition of the two events in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-1.htm">2 Samuel 1:1</a>, is that they were nearly contemporaneous. The man "came from the army from with Saul," and therefore appears to have kept near to Saul during the battle.</body></html>
