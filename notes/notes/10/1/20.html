Gath seems to have had special prominence as the city of Achish; not impossibly the temple of Ashtaroth in which Saul’s armour was deposited was the famous temple of Venus at Askelon. See note on <a href="/1_samuel/31-10.htm" title="And they put his armor in the house of Ashtaroth: and they fastened his body to the wall of Bethshan.">1 Samuel 31:10</a>. The phrase “Tell it not in Gath” is quoted in <a href="/micah/1-10.htm" title="Declare you it not at Gath, weep you not at all: in the house of Aphrah roll yourself in the dust.">Micah 1:10</a> (E. V. declare), and perhaps passed into a proverb.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Publish it not</span>] Additional force is gained by keeping the usual meaning of the word, <span class="bld">publish not the good news</span> (LXX. accurately, <span class="greekheb">μὴ εὐαγγελίσησθε</span>). Of course the words can only be understood as a poetical wish that it were possible for Israel to be spared the degradation of Philistine triumph. The news was carried at once throughout the land (<a href="/1_samuel/31-9.htm" title="And they cut off his head, and stripped off his armor, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to publish it in the house of their idols, and among the people.">1 Samuel 31:9</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the daughters of the Philistines</span>] Victories were celebrated by the women of the country with public songs and dances.

No small part of the bitterness of defeat to a pious heart consisted in the triumph of the heathen over God’s inheritance. Cp. <a href="/1_samuel/14-6.htm" title="And Jonathan said to the young man that bore his armor, Come, and let us go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised: it may be that the LORD will work for us: for there is no restraint to the LORD to save by many or by few.">1 Samuel 14:6</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Gath...  Askelon.</span> By thus localizing the triumph, and bringing before the mind the thought of multitudes in these well-known places rejoicing with dance and song over the news of their victory, a more affecting picture is produced by the contrast with Israel's distress than could have been effected by mere generalizations. Probably, too, there was present in David's mind the remembrance of scenes which he had witnessed in these towns. In course of time, "Tell it not in Gath" became a proverb (<a href="/micah/1-10.htm">Micah 1:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The daughters.</span> It is the custom in the East for the women to celebrate the prowess of the nation's warriors (<a href="/exodus/15-20.htm">Exodus 15:20</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/18-6.htm">1 Samuel 18:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/68-11.htm">Psalm 68:11</a> Revised Version). <span class="cmt_word">Uncircumcised</span>. For some unknown reason, this word is used as a term of reproach, especially of the Philistines (<a href="/1_samuel/14-6.htm">1 Samuel 14:6</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/17-26.htm">1 Samuel 17:26</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>David then reproached him for what he had done: "How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the Lord's anointed?" and commanded one of his attendants to slay him (<a href="/2_samuel/1-15.htm">2 Samuel 1:15</a>.), passing sentence of death in these words: "Thy blood come upon thy head (cf. <a href="/leviticus/20-9.htm">Leviticus 20:9</a>; <a href="/joshua/2-1.htm">Joshua 2:1</a>;(1); for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the Lord's anointed."<p>(Note: "Thy mouth hath testified against thee, and out of it thou art judged (<a href="/luke/19-22.htm">Luke 19:22</a>), whether thou hast done it or not. If thou hast done it, thou receivest the just reward of thy deeds. If thou hast not done it, then throw the blame upon thine own lying testimony, and be content with the wages of a wicked flatterer; for, according to thine own confession, thou art the murderer of a king, and that is quite enough to betray thine evil heart. David could see plainly enough that the man was no murderer: he would show by his example that flatterers who boast of such sins as these should get no hearing from their superiors." - Berleb. Bible.)<p>David regarded the statement of the Amalekite as a sufficient ground for condemnation, without investigating the truth any further; though it was most probably untrue, as he could see through his design of securing a great reward as due to him for performing such a deed (vid., <a href="/2_samuel/4-10.htm">2 Samuel 4:10</a>), and looked upon a man who could attribute such an act to himself from mere avarice as perfectly capable of committing it. Moreover, the king's jewels, which he had brought, furnished a practical proof that Saul had really been put to death. This punishment was by no means so severe as to render it necessary to "estimate its morality according to the times," or to defend it merely from the standpoint of political prudence, on the ground that as David was the successor of Saul, and had been pursued by him as his rival with constant suspicion and hatred, he ought not to leave the murder of the king unpunished, if only because the people, or at any rate his own opponents among the people, would accuse him of complicity in the murder of the king, if not of actually instigating the murderer. David would never have allowed such considerations as these to lead him into unjust severity. And his conduct requires no such half vindication. Even on the supposition that Saul had asked the Amalekite to give him his death-thrust, as he said he had, it was a crime deserving of punishment to fulfil this request, the more especially as nothing is said about any such mortal wounding of Saul as rendered his escape or recovery impossible, so that it could be said that it would have been cruel under such circumstances to refuse his request to be put to death. If Saul's life was still "full in him," as the Amalekite stated, his position was not so desperate as to render it inevitable that he should fall into the hands of the Philistines. Moreover, the supposition was a very natural one, that he had slain the king for the sake of a reward. But slaying the king, the anointed of the Lord, was in itself a crime that deserved to be punished with death. What David might more than once have done, but had refrained from doing from holy reverence for the sanctified person of the king, this foreigner, a man belonging to the nation of the Amalekites, Israel's greatest foes, had actually done for the sake of gain, or at any rate pretended to have done. Such a crime must be punished with death, and that by David who had been chosen by God and anointed as Saul's successor, and whom the Amalekite himself acknowledge in that capacity, since otherwise he would not have brought him the news together with the royal diadem. </body></html>
