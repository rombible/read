David's question, "How went the matter?" evinces the deep interest he took in the war, an interest that sprang from feelings of high and generous patriotism, not from views of ambition. The Amalekite, however, judging him to be actuated by a selfish principle, fabricated a story improbable and inconsistent, which he thought would procure him a reward. Having probably witnessed the suicidal act of Saul, he thought of turning it to his own account, and suffered the penalty of his grievously mistaken calculation (compare 2Sa 1:9 with 1Sa 31:4, 5).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">On the third day</span>; from David’s return to Ziklag, as the foregoing words manifest. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">With his clothes rent, and earth upon his head</span>; pretending sorrow for the loss of God’s people, in compliance with David’s humour. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>It came to pass on the third day,....

But if we may place it in the neighbourhood of Beersheba (see note on <a href="/1_samuel/27-6.htm" title="Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day: why Ziklag pertains to the kings of Judah to this day.">1 Samuel 27:6</a>), the distance from the battle-field of Gilboa was about 90 or 100 miles as the crow flies, between two and three days’ journey for an active runner, so that the battle probably took place about the same time as David’s return home.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">a man came out of the camp from Saul</span>] This expression and that of <span class="ital"><a href="/2_samuel/1-3.htm" title="And David said to him, From where come you?

On the other hand, the words of <span class="ital"><a href="/2_samuel/1-6.htm" title="And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance on mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned on his spear; and, see, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.">2 Samuel 1:6</a></span>, “I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa,” seem to describe his presence on the battle-field as accidental. On the whole it is best to suppose that he was connected with the army, and to understand <span class="ital"><a href="/2_samuel/1-6.htm" title="And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance on mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned on his spear; and, see, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.">2 Samuel 1:6</a></span> to mean merely that his finding Saul was accidental.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head</span>] With the same tokens of mourning as the man of Benjamin who bore the news of the disastrous defeat of Aphek to Shiloh.

There however the word rendered <span class="ital">clothes</span> is different, perhaps denoting <span class="ital">a military dress</span>, as in <a href="/1_samuel/17-38.htm" title="And Saul armed David with his armor, and he put an helmet of brass on his head; also he armed him with a coat of mail.">1 Samuel 17:38</a> : that used here is the ordinary term.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">fell to the earth, and did obeisance</span>] Recognising David as Saul’s successor, and expecting a reward for his tidings.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">did obeisance</span>] <span class="ital">Obeisance</span>, derived from Lat. <span class="ital">obedire</span> through Fr. <span class="ital">obéissance</span>, was originally used in the literal sense of <span class="ital">obedience</span>, but in Bible-English is limited to the act of prostration, which was the outward token of obedience or reverence. The Heb. word, variously translated in the E. V. ‘bow oneself,’ ‘bow down,’ ‘fall flat,’ ‘crouch,’ ‘reverence,’ ‘do reverence,’ ‘worship,’ means literally <span class="ital">to bow oneself down</span>, and specially <span class="ital">to worship</span> God.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">On the third day.</span> This means the third day after David's return with the spoil and captives recovered from the Amalekites. If we study the data, we find that David had marched with Achish as far as Aphek in the plain of Jezreel (<a href="/1_samuel/29-1.htm">1 Samuel 29:1</a>), opposite to which, on the rising ground near Gilboa, Saul had posted his army. A march of three days had brought him back to Ziklag (<a href="/1_samuel/30-1.htm">1 Samuel 30:1</a>), and after the shortest possible delay he had started in pursuit of the Amalekites. The rapidity of his movements is proved by so large a proportion of his hardy men falling out of the ranks at the brook Besor; but nevertheless some time must have been lost at Ziklag in discovering the greatness of their disaster, in searching for any who might possibly have escaped, in getting food, and in mustering again together for the pursuit. Near the brook they seem to have found the Egyptian slave who became their guide, and who had been abandoned three days before David found him. It follows, therefore, that the Amalekites were then three days' march in advance, and however rapidly the pursuit was urged on, we cannot allow less than five days for it, and one for the battle (vers. 12, 13, 17). The march homeward would take a longer time, as David was now encumbered with flocks and herds, women and children. If it took eight days, the time occupied in it by the Amalekites, the whole period that had elapsed since David was sent away from Aphek by the Philistine lords would be eighteen or nineteen days; and it is thus evident that the Amalekites were plundering Ziklag at the very time when he was being dismissed, half angry, half rejoicing, at the slight put upon him, but little thinking of the sad need there was for his presence elsewhere. Now, the messenger from Gilboa, if an active runner, weald easily traverse in two days the distance which David and his men had travelled in three. And thus it follows that the battle at Gilboa was fought on the very day of David's happy return from the pursuit, and about nineteen days after the review at Aphek. If the word "tomorrow" in <a href="/1_samuel/28-19.htm">1 Samuel 28:19</a> seems to imply a more rapid march of events, we must remember that the meaning of the word in Hebrew is more indefinite than with us (comp. <a href="/genesis/30-33.htm">Genesis 30:33</a>; <a href="/exodus/13-14.htm">Exodus 13:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">With his clothes rent, and earth upon his head.</span> Though the Amalekite came out of the camp, yet we are not to suppose that he had been one of the combatants. Every army is followed by a vast number of vagabonds, intent upon gain, purchasing of the troops their booty, plundering wherever they have the chance, and carrying on a lucrative but illicit trade. He was more probably a sort of gipsy sutler than, as many suppose, the slave of some Israelite. He professes, however, to be upon Israel's side, and appears with the usual marks of sorrow. By so doing he hoped to commend himself to David, whom he knew to be too patriotic to rejoice at the defeat of his countrymen, though he doubted not that he would hear with joy of the death of so inveterate a personal enemy as Saul. On this account, and because the way would now stand open to David's ambition, he evidently felt sure of receiving a large guerdon for his news. There is, moreover, a further interest in his conduct; for it demonstrates the existence of a widespread popular feeling that David was destined to be Israel's king. It was this conviction which made him give David kingly honour; <span class="cmt_word">for he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.</span> And all Israel, on the morrow after the defeat, would probably have done the same, but for David's own conduct. Israel was too high-spirited a nation to take at once for a king a man who had marched with their enemies to fight against them, even though they knew that the voice of prophecy had appointed him to inherit Saul's throne. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/31.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>On the day following the battle, when the Philistines tripped the slain, they found Saul and his three sons lying upon Gilboa; and having cut off their heads and plundered their weapons, they went them (the heads and weapons) as trophies into the land of the Philistines, i.e., round about to the different towns and hamlets of their land, to announce the joyful news in their idol-temples (the writer of the Chronicles mentions the idols themselves) and to the people, and then deposited their weapons (the weapons of Saul and his sons) in the Astarte-houses. But the corpses they fastened to the town-wall of Beth-shean, i.e., Beisan, in the valley of the Jordan (see at <a href="/joshua/17-11.htm">Joshua 17:11</a>). Beth-azabbim and Beth-ashtaroth are composite words; the first part is indeclinable, and the plural form is expressed by the second word: idol-houses and Astarte-houses, like beth-aboth (father's-houses: see at <a href="/exodus/6-14.htm">Exodus 6:14</a>). On the Astartes, see at <a href="/judges/2-13.htm">Judges 2:13</a>. It is not expressly stated indeed in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-9.htm">1 Samuel 31:9</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-10.htm">1 Samuel 31:10</a>, that the Philistines plundered the bodies of Saul's sons as well, and mutilated them by cutting off their heads; but &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493; and &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;, his (i.e., Saul's) head and his weapons, alone are mentioned. At the same time, it is every evident from <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-12.htm">1 Samuel 31:12</a>, where the Jabeshites are said to have taken down from the wall of Beth-shean not Saul's body only, but the bodies of his sons also, that the Philistines had treated the corpses of Saul's sons in just the same manner as that of Saul himself. The writer speaks distinctly of the abuse of Saul's body only, because it was his death that he had chiefly in mind at the time. To the word &#1493;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468; we must supply in thought the object &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493; and &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; from the preceding clause. &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1514; and &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1514; (<a href="/1_samuel/31-10.htm">1 Samuel 31:10</a> and <a href="/1_samuel/31-12.htm">1 Samuel 31:12</a>) are the corpses without the heads. The fact that the Philistines nailed them to the town-wall of Beth-shean presupposes the capture of that city, from which it is evident that they had occupied the land as far as the Jordan. The definite word Beth-ashtaroth is changed by the writer of the Chronicles into Beth-elohim, temples of the gods; or rather he has interpreted it in this manner without altering the sense, as the Astartes are merely mentioned as the principal deities for the idols generally. The writer of the Chronicles has also omitted to mention the nailing of the corpses to the wall of Beth-shean, but he states instead that "they fastened his skull in the temple of Dagon," a fact which is passed over in the account before us. From this we may see how both writers have restricted themselves to the principal points, or those which appeared to them of the greatest importance (vid., Bertheau on <a href="/1_chronicles/10-10.htm">1 Chronicles 10:10</a>). </body></html>
