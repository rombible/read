The woman therefore says, if there is any such guilt in sparing my son, may it rest upon me and my house, not on David and his throne. Compare <a href="/2_samuel/3-28.htm">2 Samuel 3:28</a>. The cunning speech of the woman extracted a more direct promise of protection from the king <a href="/2_samuel/14-1.htm">2 Samuel 14:1</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. the woman said &#8230; O king, the iniquity be on me&#8212;that is, the iniquity of arresting the course of justice and pardoning a homicide, whom the Goel was bound to slay wherever he might find him, unless in a city of refuge. This was exceeding the royal prerogative, and acting in the character of an absolute monarch. The woman's language refers to a common precaution taken by the Hebrew judges and magistrates, solemnly to transfer from themselves the responsibility of the blood they doomed to be shed, either to the accusers or the criminals (2Sa 1:16; 3:28); and sometimes the accusers took it upon themselves (Mt 27:25).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The sense is, either, first, this, If I do not inform thee aright, and thou thereby be drawn to give an unrighteous sentence on my behalf, I am willing to bear the whole blame of it before God, and men; I acknowledge thou art wholly innocent in the case. Compare <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/genesis/27-13.htm" title="And his mother said to him, On me be your curse, my son: only obey my voice, and go fetch me them.">Genesis 27:13</a></span>. Or, secondly, this, If through thy forgetfulness or neglect of this my just cause, my adversaries prevail and destroy my son, my desire is, that God would not lay it to the king’s charge, but rather to me and mine, so the king may be exempted thereby. Whereby she both insinuates her great esteem of and affection for the king, thereby winning upon him to compass her design; and withal implies that such an omission of the king’s will bring guilt upon him; and yet most prudently and decently orders her phrase so as not to seem to blame or threaten the king. Compare <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/exodus/5-16.htm" title="There is no straw given to your servants, and they say to us, Make brick: and, behold, your servants are beaten; but the fault is in your own people.">Exodus 5:16</a>,<a href="/2_samuel/20-16.htm" title="Then cried a wise woman out of the city, Hear, hear; say, I pray you, to Joab, Come near here, that I may speak with you.">2 Samuel 20:16</a></span>. This sense seems best to agree with David’s answer, which shows that she desired some further assurance of the king’s care and justice in her concern. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/14.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the woman of Tekoah said unto the king, my lord and king,.... With much vehemence, and yet with great respect, fearing an inquisition into her case; which it would not bear, being a fable, and being very desirous of having sentence on it immediately pronounced: <p>the iniquity be on me and on my father's house; let the crime be imputed to me and my family, and punishment inflicted on us for it, if I have misrepresented the case, told lies, and deceived the king: <p>and the king and his throne be guiltless; let neither he nor his kingdom be charged with any sin, or suffer any damage on that account: or else the sense is, supposing that the king through much business should forget and neglect this affair; and her son should be put to death, through the violence and rage of the family; then she wishes that the fault and punishment of such neglect might not fall upon the king and his kingdom, but upon her and her family: in this form she put it, for the honour of the king, and because she would not be thought to wish ill to him and his kingdom; yet tacitly suggests, that should this be the case, he and his kingdom must expect to answer and suffer for it. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_samuel/14.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the woman of Tekoah said unto the king, My lord, O king, the <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> iniquity <i>be</i> on me, and on my father's house: and the king and his throne <i>be</i> guiltless.</span><p>(e) Concerning the breach of the Law which punishes blood, let me bear the blame.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/2_samuel/14.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">9</span>. <span class="ital">the iniquity be on me</span>, &c.] If there is any guilt in thus leaving bloodshed unavenged, may I and my family bear the punishment.

Less than this would not help Absalom's case. Instead, therefore, of  withdrawing, she represents herself as dissatisfied, and pleads for full forgiveness; and as this would be a violation of the letter of the Levitical Law, in order to remove David's supposed scruples, she takes upon herself the penalty. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/14.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When Joab perceived that the king's heart was against Absalom, he sent for a cunning woman from Tekoah, to work upon the king and change his mind, so that he might grant forgiveness to Absalom. <a href="/2_samuel/14-1.htm">2 Samuel 14:1</a> is understood by the majority of commentators, in accordance with the Syriac and Vulgate, as signifying that Joab learned that the king's heart was inclined towards Absalom, was well disposed towards him again. But this explanation is neither philologically sustained, nor in accordance with the context. &#1500;&#1489;, written with &#1506;&#1500; and without any verb, so that &#1492;&#1497;&#1492; has to be supplied, only occurs again in <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/11-28.htm">Daniel 11:28</a>, where the preposition has the meaning "against." It is no argument against this meaning here, that if David had been ill disposed towards Absalom, there would have been no necessity to state that Joab perceived it; for we cannot see why Joab should only have perceived or noticed David's friendly feelings, and not his unfriendly feelings as well. If, however, Joab had noticed the re-awakening of David's good feelings towards Absalom, there would have been no necessity for him to bring the cunning woman from Tekoah to induce him to consent to Absalom's return. Moreover, David would not in that case have refused to allow Absalom to see his face for two whole years after his return to Jerusalem (<a href="/2_samuel/14-24.htm">2 Samuel 14:24</a>).

The "wise woman" was to put on mourning, as a woman who had been mourning for a long while for some one that was dead (&#1492;&#1514;&#1488;&#1489;&#1468;&#1500;, to set or show herself mourning), and to go to the king in this attire, and say what Joab had put into her mouth.</body></html>
