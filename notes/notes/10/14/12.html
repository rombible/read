It is true, Absalom’s case, as we have observed, was widely different from that which she had supposed. But David was too well affected to him to remark that difference, and was more desirous than she could be to apply that favourable judgment to his own son which he had given concerning hers.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/14.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>14:1-20 We may notice here, how this widow pleads God's mercy, and his clemency toward poor guilty sinners. The state of sinners is a state of banishment from God.

The meaning of <a href="/2_samuel/14-13.htm">2 Samuel 14:13</a> may be paraphrased thus: "If you have done right as regards my son, how is it that you harbor such a purpose of vengeance against Absalom as to keep him, one of God's people, an outcast in a pagan country, far from the worship of the God of Israel? Upon your own showing you are guilty of a great fault in not allowing Absalom to return."<p>The king doth speak ... - literally, "And from the king speaking this word (this sentence of absolution to my son) he is as one guilty; i. e. the sentence you have pronounced in favor of my son condemns your own conduct toward Absalom." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. the woman said &#8230; O king, the iniquity be on me&#8212;that is, the iniquity of arresting the course of justice and pardoning a homicide, whom the Goel was bound to slay wherever he might find him, unless in a city of refuge. This was exceeding the royal prerogative, and acting in the character of an absolute monarch. The woman's language refers to a common precaution taken by the Hebrew judges and magistrates, solemnly to transfer from themselves the responsibility of the blood they doomed to be shed, either to the accusers or the criminals (2Sa 1:16; 3:28); and sometimes the accusers took it upon themselves (Mt 27:25).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Having obliged the king by his oath in her supposed case, she now throws off the veil, and begins to apply this parable to the king’s and kingdom’s present case. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/14.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then the woman said, let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak one word unto my Lord the king,....

Firmly and clearly, but yet to all appearance incidentally, she argues from the case of her son to that of Absalom.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/14.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When the king asked her, "What aileth thee?" the woman described the pretended calamity which had befallen her, saying that she was a widow, and her two sons had quarrelled in the field; and as no one interposed, one of them had killed the other. The whole family had then risen up and demanded that the survivor should be given up, that they might carry out the avenging of blood upon him. Thus they sought to destroy the heir also, and extinguish the only spark that remained to her, so as to leave her husband neither name nor posterity upon the earth. The suffix attached to &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;, with the object following ("he smote him, the other," <a href="/2_samuel/14-6.htm">2 Samuel 14:6</a>), may be explained from the diffuseness of the style of ordinary conversation (see at <a href="/1_samuel/21-14.htm">1 Samuel 21:14</a>). There is no reason whatever for changing the reading into &#1497;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, as the suffix ow, though unusual with verbs &#1492;&#1500;, is not without parallel; not to mention the fact that the plural &#1497;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; is quite unsuitable. There is also quite as little reason for changing &#1493;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1491;&#1492; into &#1493;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;, in accordance with the Syriac and Arabic, as Michaelis and Thenius propose, on the ground that "the woman would have described her relatives as diabolically malicious men, if she had put into their mouths such words as these, 'We will destroy the heir also.' " It was the woman's intention to describe the conduct of the relations and their pursuit of blood-revenge in the harshest terms possible, in order that she might obtain help from the king. She begins to speak in her own name at the word &#1493;&#1499;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; ("and so they shall quench and"), where she resorts to a figure, for the purpose of appealing to the heart of the king to defend her from the threatened destruction of her family, saying, "And so they shall quench the burning coal which is left." &#1490;&#1468;&#1495;&#1500;&#1514; is used figuratively, like &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, the burning coal with which one kindles a fresh fire, to denote the last remnant. &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; &#1500;&#1489;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;: "so as not to set," i.e., to preserve or leave name and remnant (i.e., posterity) to my husband.<p>This account differed, no doubt, from the case of Absalom, inasmuch as in his case no murder had taken place in the heat of a quarrel, and no avenger of blood demanded his death; so that the only resemblance was in the fact that there existed an intention to punish a murderer. But it was necessary to disguise the affair in this manner, in order that David might not detect her purpose, but might pronounce a decision out of pity for the poor widow which could be applied to his own conduct towards Absalom.</body></html>
