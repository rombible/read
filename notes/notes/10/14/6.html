And Joab sent to Tekoah, and fetched thence a wise woman&#8212;The king was strongly attached to Absalom; and having now got over his sorrow for the violent death of Amnon, he was desirous of again enjoying the society of his favorite son, who had now been three long years absent. But a dread of public opinion and a regard to the public interests made him hesitate about recalling or pardoning his guilty son; and Joab, whose discerning mind perceived this struggle between parental affection and royal duty, devised a plan for relieving the scruples, and, at the same time, gratifying the wishes, of his master. Having procured a countrywoman of superior intelligence and address, he directed her to seek an audience of the king, and by soliciting his royal interposition in the settlement of a domestic grievance, convinced him that the life of a murderer might in some cases be saved. Tekoah was about twelve miles south of Jerusalem, and six south of Beth-lehem; and the design of bringing a woman from such a distance was to prevent either the petitioner being known, or the truth of her story easily investigated. Her speech was in the form of a parable&#8212;the circumstances&#8212;the language&#8212;the manner&#8212;well suited to the occasion, represented a case as like David's as it was policy to make it, so as not to be prematurely discovered. Having got the king pledged, she avowed it to be her design to satisfy the royal conscience, that in pardoning Absalom he was doing nothing more than he would have done in the case of a stranger, where there could be no imputation of partiality. The device succeeded; David traced its origin to Joab; and, secretly pleased at obtaining the judgment of that rough, but generally sound-thinking soldier, he commissioned him to repair to Geshur and bring home his exiled son.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">There was none to part them; </span> and therefore there is no witness, either that he killed him, or how he killed him, whether from some sudden passion and great provocation, or in his own necessary defence, or otherwise. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Slew him; </span> as the avengers of blood report. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/14.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And thy handmaid had two sons,....

In adopting this translation of the difficult clause with which the verse commences, we take &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500; in the sense of &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;, as the verbs &#1499;&#1500;&#1492; and &#1499;&#1500;&#1488; frequently exchange their forms; we also take the third pers. fem. as the neuter impersonal, so that the subject is left indefinite, and is to be gathered from the context. Absalom's flight to Geshur, and his stay there, were what chiefly prevented David from going out to Absalom. Moreover, David's grief on account of Amnon's death gradually diminished as time rolled on. &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1489;&#1513; &#1510;&#1488;&#1514; is used in a hostile sense, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-7.htm">Deuteronomy 28:7</a>, to go out and punish him for his wickedness. The &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; before &#1504;&#1495;&#1501; might also be rendered "but," as after a negative clause, as the principal sentence implies a negation: "He did not go out against Absalom, but comforted himself." There is not only no grammatical difficulty in the way of this explanation of the verse, but it also suits the context, both before and after. All the other explanations proposed are either at variance with the rules of the language, or contain an unsuitable thought. The old Jewish interpretation (adopted in the Chaldee version, and also by the Rabbins), viz., David longed (his soul pined) to go out to Absalom (i.e., to see or visit him), is opposed, as Gusset has shown (in his Lex. pp. 731-2), to the conduct of David towards Absalom as described in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/14.htm">2 Samuel 14</a>, - namely, that after Joab had succeeded by craft in bringing him back to Jerusalem, David would not allow him to come into his presence for two whole years (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-24.htm">2 Samuel 14:24</a>, <a href="/2_samuel/14-28.htm">2 Samuel 14:28</a>). Luther's rendering, "and king David left off going out against Absalom," is not only precluded by the feminine &#1514;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;, but also by the fact that nothing has been said about any pursuit of Absalom on the part of David. Other attempts at emendations there is no need whatever to refute. </body></html>
