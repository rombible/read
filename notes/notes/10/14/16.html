Absalom has reason to complain that he is treated by his own father more sternly and severely than the meanest subject in the realm; and the whole nation will have cause for saying that the king shows more attention to the petition of a humble woman than to the wishes and desires of a whole kingdom.

The king replied to the woman, "Go home, I will give charge concerning thee," i.e., I will give the necessary commands that thy son may not be slain by the avenger of blood. This declaration on the part of the king was perfectly just. If the brothers had quarrelled, and one had killed the other in the heat of the quarrel, it was right that he should be defended from the avenger of blood, because it could not be assumed that there was any previous intention to murder. This declaration therefore could not be applied as yet to David's conduct towards Absalom. But the woman consequently proceeded to say (<a href="/2_samuel/14-9.htm">2 Samuel 14:9</a>), "My lord, O king, let the guilt be upon me and upon my father's house, and let the king and his throne be guiltless." &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1468;&#1488;, the throne, for the government or reign. The meaning of the words is this: but if there should be anything wrong in the fact that this bloodshed is not punished, let the guilt fall upon me and my family. The king replied (<a href="/2_samuel/14-10.htm">2 Samuel 14:10</a>), "Whosoever speaketh to thee, bring him to me; he shall not touch thee any more." &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498; does not stand for &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498;, "against thee;" but the meaning is, whoever speaks to thee any more about this, i.e., demands thy son of thee again.</body></html>
