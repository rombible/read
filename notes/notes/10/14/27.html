And we read that he had a very fine head of hair. It was a burden to him, but he would not cut it as long as he could bear the weight.

But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty&#8212;This extraordinary popularity arose not only from his high spirit and courtly manners, but from his uncommonly handsome appearance. One distinguishing feature, seemingly an object of great admiration, was a profusion of beautiful hair. Its extraordinary luxuriance compelled him to cut it "at every year's end;" lit., "at times," "from time to time," when it was found to weigh two hundred shekels&#8212;equal to one hundred twelve ounces troy; but as "the weight was after the king's shekel," which was less than the common shekel, the rate has been reduced as low as three pounds, two ounces [Bochart], and even less by others.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Three sons; </span> all which died not long after they were born, as may be gathered from <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/2_samuel/18-18.htm" title="Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a pillar, which is in the king's dale: for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after his own name: and it is called to this day, Absalom's place.">2 Samuel 18:18</a></span>, where it is said that <span class="ital">Absalom had no son.

The natural inference is that <span class="ital">Michaiah</span> is an alternative name or a textual error for <span class="ital">Maachah</span>, and that Maachah was the daughter or Uriel and Tamar, and granddaughter of Absalom, named after her great-grandmother.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Three sons.</span> Their names are not given, because they died early (see <a href="/2_samuel/18-18.htm">2 Samuel 18:18</a>).

We thus gather that Tamar married Uriel, and that it was the granddaughter of Absalom who became Rehoboam's queen. It is strictly in accordance with Hebrew custom to call Absalom's granddaughter his daughter, and, as Uriel was a man of no political importance, he is passed over, as the narrator's object was to show that Abijah's mother was sprung from the handsome and notorious son of David (see also <a href="/2_chronicles/11-20.htm">2 Chronicles 11:20, 21</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/14.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>David then promised Joab, that the request which he had presented through the medium of the woman of Tekoah should be fulfilled, and commanded him to fetch Absalom back.
