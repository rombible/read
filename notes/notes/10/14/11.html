This was exceeding the royal prerogative, and acting in the character of an absolute monarch. The woman's language refers to a common precaution taken by the Hebrew judges and magistrates, solemnly to transfer from themselves the responsibility of the blood they doomed to be shed, either to the accusers or the criminals (2Sa 1:16; 3:28); and sometimes the accusers took it upon themselves (Mt 27:25).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Let the king remember the Lord thy God:</span> the sense is, either, first, Make mention (as this Hebrew verb is oft rendered) of the name of the Lord thy God, to wit, in an oath, i.e. swear to me by God, that thou wilt protect me and my son against the revenger of blood; for so David did in compliance with this desire of hers. Only she was forced to express her mind in more general and ambiguous terms, because it had been presumption and rudeness for her in plain terms to desire the king’s oath, as if she durst not trust his word; yet withal she insinuates her meaning so plainly that the king understood it; and yet so handsomely and elegantly, that the king was much pleased with her wisdom, and thereby inclined to grant her request.

Nothing short of this would serve Absalom, who already was so far forgiven as to be in no fear of actual punishment. It is remarkable that David does not hesitate finally to grant this without making further inquiry, though he must have known that a mother's pleas were not likely to be very impartial. Moreover, while in ver. 9 she had acknowledged that there might be a breach of the law in pardoning a murderer, she now appeals to the mercy of Jehovah, who had himself provided limits to the anger of the avenger of blood (see <a href="/numbers/35.htm">Numbers 35</a>.). He had thus shown himself to be a God of equity, in whom mercy triumphed over the rigid enactments of law. The words which follow more exactly mean, "That the avenger of blood do not multiply destruction, and that they destroy not my son." Moved by this entreaty, the king grants her son full pardon, under the solemn guaranty of an oath. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/14.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When the king asked her, "What aileth thee?" the woman described the pretended calamity which had befallen her, saying that she was a widow, and her two sons had quarrelled in the field; and as no one interposed, one of them had killed the other. The whole family had then risen up and demanded that the survivor should be given up, that they might carry out the avenging of blood upon him. Thus they sought to destroy the heir also, and extinguish the only spark that remained to her, so as to leave her husband neither name nor posterity upon the earth. The suffix attached to &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;, with the object following ("he smote him, the other," <a href="/2_samuel/14-6.htm">2 Samuel 14:6</a>), may be explained from the diffuseness of the style of ordinary conversation (see at <a href="/1_samuel/21-14.htm">1 Samuel 21:14</a>). There is no reason whatever for changing the reading into &#1497;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, as the suffix ow, though unusual with verbs &#1492;&#1500;, is not without parallel; not to mention the fact that the plural &#1497;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; is quite unsuitable. There is also quite as little reason for changing &#1493;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1491;&#1492; into &#1493;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;, in accordance with the Syriac and Arabic, as Michaelis and Thenius propose, on the ground that "the woman would have described her relatives as diabolically malicious men, if she had put into their mouths such words as these, 'We will destroy the heir also.' " It was the woman's intention to describe the conduct of the relations and their pursuit of blood-revenge in the harshest terms possible, in order that she might obtain help from the king. She begins to speak in her own name at the word &#1493;&#1499;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; ("and so they shall quench and"), where she resorts to a figure, for the purpose of appealing to the heart of the king to defend her from the threatened destruction of her family, saying, "And so they shall quench the burning coal which is left." &#1490;&#1468;&#1495;&#1500;&#1514; is used figuratively, like &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, the burning coal with which one kindles a fresh fire, to denote the last remnant. &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; &#1500;&#1489;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;: "so as not to set," i.e., to preserve or leave name and remnant (i.e., posterity) to my husband.<p>This account differed, no doubt, from the case of Absalom, inasmuch as in his case no murder had taken place in the heat of a quarrel, and no avenger of blood demanded his death; so that the only resemblance was in the fact that there existed an intention to punish a murderer. But it was necessary to disguise the affair in this manner, in order that David might not detect her purpose, but might pronounce a decision out of pity for the poor widow which could be applied to his own conduct towards Absalom.</body></html>
