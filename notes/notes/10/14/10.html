This was exceeding the royal prerogative, and acting in the character of an absolute monarch. The woman's language refers to a common precaution taken by the Hebrew judges and magistrates, solemnly to transfer from themselves the responsibility of the blood they doomed to be shed, either to the accusers or the criminals (2Sa 1:16; 3:28); and sometimes the accusers took it upon themselves (Mt 27:25).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> i.e. So as to hurt or molest thee, by pursuing thy son. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/14.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the king said, whoever saith ought unto thee,....

All the old translators have given as the rendering of &#1492;&#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1492; &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; "the woman came (went) to the king," as if they had read &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1488;. This reading is actually found in some thirty Codd. of De Rossi, and is therefore regarded by Thenius and the majority of critics as the original one. But Bttcher has very justly urged, in opposition to this, that &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; cannot possibly be an accidental corruption of &#1493;&#1514;&#1489;&#1488;, and that it is still less likely that such an alteration should have been intentionally made. But this remark, which is correct enough in itself, cannot sustain the conjecture which Bttcher has founded upon it, namely that two whole lines have dropt out of the Hebrew text, containing the answer which the woman of Tekoah gave to Joab before she went to the king, since there is not one of the ancient versions which contains a single word more than the Masoretic text. Consequently we must regard &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; as the original reading, and interpret it as a hysteron-proteron, which arose from the fact that the historian was about to relate at once what the woman said to the king, but thought it desirable to mention her falling down at the feet of the king before giving her actual words, "Help, O king," which he introduces by repeating the word &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;.</body></html>
