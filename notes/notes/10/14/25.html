And we read that he had a very fine head of hair. It was a burden to him, but he would not cut it as long as he could bear the weight. That which feeds and gratifies pride, is not complained of, though uneasy. May the Lord grant us the beauty of holiness, and the adorning of a meek and quiet spirit!

But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty&#8212;This extraordinary popularity arose not only from his high spirit and courtly manners, but from his uncommonly handsome appearance. One distinguishing feature, seemingly an object of great admiration, was a profusion of beautiful hair. Its extraordinary luxuriance compelled him to cut it "at every year's end;" lit., "at times," "from time to time," when it was found to weigh two hundred shekels&#8212;equal to one hundred twelve ounces troy; but as "the weight was after the king's shekel," which was less than the common shekel, the rate has been reduced as low as three pounds, two ounces [Bochart], and even less by others.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This is here noted as the occasion of his pride and insolency, and of the people’s affections to him, and consequently of the following rebellion. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/14.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty,....

He therefore told her to answer the question without disguise: whether the hand of Joab was with her in all this. She replied, "Truly there is not (&#1488;&#1501;) anything to the right hand or to the left of all that my lord the king saith," i.e., the king always hits the right point in everything that he said.
