A discreet woman, by her prudent management, satisfied Joab, and yet saved the city. Wisdom is not confined to rank or sex; it consists not in deep knowledge; but in understanding how to act as matters arise, that troubles may be turned away and benefits secured. A great deal of mischief would be prevented, if contending parties would understand one another. Let both sides be undeceived. The single condition of peace is, the surrender of the traitor. It is so in God's dealing with the soul, when besieged by conviction and distress; sin is the traitor; the beloved lust is the rebel: part with that, cast away the transgression, and all shall be well. There is no peace on any other terms.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Joab's character is strongly brought out in the transaction. Politic, decided, bold, and unscrupulous, but never needlessly cruel or impulsive, or even revengeful. No life is safe that stands in his way, but from policy he never sacrifices the most insignificant life without a purpose. (Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-27.htm">2 Samuel 2:27-30</a>.) <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/20.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18-20. They were wont to speak in old time&#8212;The translation of the Margin gives a better meaning, which is to this effect: When the people saw thee lay siege to Abel, they said, Surely he will ask if we will have peace, for the law (De 20:10) prescribes that he should offer peace to strangers, much more then to Israelitish cities; and if he do this, we shall soon bring things to an amicable agreement, for we are a peaceable people. The answer of Joab brings out the character of that ruthless veteran as a patriot at heart, who, on securing the author of this insurrection, was ready to put a stop to further bloodshed and release the peaceable inhabitants from all molestation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/20.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">In her wisdom</span> prudently treated with them about it, either severally or jointly, as she saw fit; representing to them the certainty and nearness of all their ruin, if they did not speedily comply with her desires, and certain deliverance if they did. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">They retired; </span> Joab and his army which besieged them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/20.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom,....
