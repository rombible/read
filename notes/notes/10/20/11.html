Time was too precious for Joab himself to wait. He must put down the rebellion of Sheba by rapid action, and thereby render himself impregnable in the high office which had been his, and which he had now again usurped. He left one of his trusty men, however, by the body of Amasa, with a battle cry which should suggest that he had rightly been put to death for his doubtful loyalty, and that all who were attached to Joab and loyal to David should follow Joab. Joab’s real motive for murdering Amasa, as for murdering Abner (<a href="/2_samuel/3-27.htm" title="And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in the gate to speak with him quietly, and smote him there under the fifth rib, that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother.">2Samuel 3:27</a>), was personal jealousy and ambition.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/2_samuel/20.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/2_samuel/20-11.htm" title="And one of Joab's men stood by him, and said, He that favors Joab, and he that is for David, let him go after Joab....">2 Samuel 20:11-13</a></span>. <span class="ital">One of Joab’s men stood by him — </span>By the command of his master, who knew that this would occasion disorder among Amasa’s soldiers, and therefore left a man there on purpose to deliver the following message: <span class="ital">He that favoureth Joab — </span>He that would have Joab to be general, rather than such a perfidious rebel as Amasa. <span class="ital">And he that is for David — </span>He that wisheth David good success against Sheba, and against all rebels.

The more plot there is in a sin, the worse it is. Joab contentedly sacrificed the interest both of the king and the kingdom to his personal revenge.

What is added, "and he that is for David," was intended to identify Joab's cause with David's, and also to insinuate that Amasa had not been loyal to David (<a href="/2_samuel/20-5.htm">2 Samuel 20:5</a> note). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/20.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11-13. He that favoureth Joab, and he that is for David, let him go after Joab&#8212;It is a striking proof of Joab's unrivalled influence over the army, that with this villainous murder perpetrated before their eyes they unanimously followed him as their leader in pursuit of Sheba. A soldier conjoined his name with David's, and such a magic spell was in the word "Joab," that all the people "went on"&#8212;Amasa's men as well as the rest. The conjunction of these two names is very significant.

He appeals to their personal attachment to himself as general, and to their loyalty to David; insinuating that Amasa was not faithful to the king, and had met his death justly for his treachery. Joab’s real motive in murdering Amasa, as before in the case of Abner, was jealousy.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">One of Joab's men.</span> Joab left one of his personal followers to prevent any halt of the people round Amasa's body, and  to suggest that he was a traitor. For he was to say to them as they came up, not only that "whosoever had pleasure in Joab," but also that "all who were for David, were to go after Joab." All loyal men were to regard him as captain of the host, and to disobey him would be rebellion. Naturally they would conclude from this that Amasa had not really been true to David, and that his death was the punishment inflicted on him for his past guilt. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/20.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>But when Amasa stayed out beyond the time fixed for the execution of the royal commission (the Chethib &#1493;&#1497;&#1497;&#1495;&#1512; is the Piel &#1493;&#1497;&#1497;&#1495;&#1512;, whilst the Keri is either the Hiphil &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1495;&#1512;, or the imperfect Kal of &#1497;&#1495;&#1512;  equals  &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;, cf. &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1494;, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-9.htm">2 Samuel 20:9</a>, and is quite unnecessary), probably because the men of Judah distrusted him, and were not very ready to respond to his summons, David said to Abishai, "Now will Sheba the son of Bichri be more injurious (more dangerous) to us than Absalom. Take thou the servants (soldiers) of thy lord and pursue after him, lest he reach fortified cities, and tear out our eye," i.e., do us a serious injury.
