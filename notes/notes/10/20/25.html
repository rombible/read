The construing of &#1488;&#1504;&#1499;&#1497; with a predicate in the plural may be explained on the simple ground that the woman spoke in the name of the city as well as in its favour, and therefore had the citizens in her mind at the time, as is very evident from the figurative expression &#1488;&#1501; (mother) for mother-city or capital.<p>(Note: The correctness of the text is not to be called in question, as Thenius and Bttcher suppose, for the simple reason that all the older translators have followed the Hebrew text, including even the lxx with their &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#769; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3b9; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x399;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bb;; whereas the words &#x3b1;&#788;&#769; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf; &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788; &#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x399;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bb;, which some of the MSS contain at the close of <a href="/2_samuel/20-18.htm">2 Samuel 20:18</a> after &#x3b5;&#x3b9; &#787; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, and upon which Thenius and Bttcher have founded their conjectures, are evidently a gloss or paraphrase of &#1492;&#1514;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; &#1493;&#1499;&#1503;, and of so little value on critical grounds, that Tischendorf did not even think the reading worth mentioning in his edition of the Septuagint.)<p>The woman gave Joab to understand, in the first place, that he ought to have asked the inhabitants of Abela whether they intended to fight for Sheba before commencing the siege and destruction of the town, according to the law laid down in <a href="/deuteronomy/20-10.htm">Deuteronomy 20:10</a>. with reference to the siege of foreign towns; and secondly, that he ought to have taken into consideration the peaceableness and fidelity of the citizens of Abela, and not to destroy the peace-loving citizens and members of the nation of God.</body></html>
