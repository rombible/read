This place was appointed for the rendezvous of David's forces, and hither Amasa came with what he had assembled together, and joined them, and took the command of them: for it follows: <p>Amasa went before them; as the general of them: <p>and Joab's garment that he had put on was girded unto him; who went along with his brother Abishai at the head of his own men, to which he was obliged by virtue of his commission; or went of himself to serve the common cause, and perhaps chiefly with a design to murder Amasa, whom he envied, because he was put into his post as general, and therefore accoutred himself for it; he put on, not a coat of mail, but a common garment which he girt about him, that it might be no incumbrance to him or hinderance of him, in doing what he intended, but that he might more expeditiously execute it: <p>and upon it a girdle with a sword fastened upon his loins in the sheath thereof; the sword in the belt was not on his thigh, but on his loins, on the outside of his clothes, and was put into a sheath too large, and placed in such a position, that with the least motion, when he pleased, it would easily drop out of it, without drawing it, and so give no suspicion of his design: <p>and as he went forth; to meet Amasa, just as he came to him: <p>it fell out; the sword fell out of the sheath to the ground. <p>(r) Antiqu. l. 7. c. 11. sect. 7.

The great stone was probably some isolated rock well known in the neighbourhood. Amasa went before them; Hebrew, <span class="accented">Amasa came before them</span>; that is, came in view with the levy of men he had raised in Judah. And Joab's garment, etc.; more correctly, <span class="accented">and Joab was girded with his military coat as his garment, and over it was the strap of his sword in its sheath, and it</span> (masculine, equivalent to "the sheath") <span class="accented">came out, and it</span> (feminine, equivalent to "the sword") <span class="accented">fell.</span> This change of gender is very harsh, and has caused the Authorized Version to apply the masculine verb to Joab, and translate, and as he went forth it fell; but a very slight change, supported by the Septuagint, gives us a more satisfactory sense, namely, <span class="accented">and it</span> (<span class="accented">the sword</span>) <span class="accented">came out and fell.</span> It is generally assumed that all this was arranged beforehand on Joab's part, who had so placed his sword that he could shake it out of the sheath. More probably it was an accident, of which he took instant advantage. He had felt that his position was insecure, and that if David had the support of Amasa, and a powerful band of the men of Judah at Jerusalem, he would probably order his execution for slaying Absalom; and Amasa would carry out the command willingly enough, as he thereby would secure the high position offered him. We know David's feelings towards Joab from his dying command to Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/2-5.htm">1 Kings 2:5</a>), and probably he had given various indications of his deep seated resentment. Joab, therefore, determined to stop Amasa's growth in power, and also to give David a rough lesson. And this accident gave him an early opportunity, which he used with ruthless energy. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/20.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>All the men of Israel responded to this call, and went up (to the mountains) away from David and after Sheba; but the men of Judah adhered to their king from the Jordan to Jerusalem.

The expression "from Jordan" does not prove that Sheba's rebellion broke out at the Jordan itself, and before David's arrival in Gilgal, but may be accounted for from the fact that the men of Judah had already fetched the king back across the Jordan.</body></html>
