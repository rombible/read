A discreet woman, by her prudent management, satisfied Joab, and yet saved the city. Wisdom is not confined to rank or sex; it consists not in deep knowledge; but in understanding how to act as matters arise, that troubles may be turned away and benefits secured. A great deal of mischief would be prevented, if contending parties would understand one another. Let both sides be undeceived. The single condition of peace is, the surrender of the traitor. It is so in God's dealing with the soul, when besieged by conviction and distress; sin is the traitor; the beloved lust is the rebel: part with that, cast away the transgression, and all shall be well. There is no peace on any other terms.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Joab's character is strongly brought out in the transaction.

They were wont to speak in old time&#8212;The translation of the Margin gives a better meaning, which is to this effect: When the people saw thee lay siege to Abel, they said, Surely he will ask if we will have peace, for the law (De 20:10) prescribes that he should offer peace to strangers, much more then to Israelitish cities; and if he do this, we shall soon bring things to an amicable agreement, for we are a peaceable people. The answer of Joab brings out the character of that ruthless veteran as a patriot at heart, who, on securing the author of this insurrection, was ready to put a stop to further bloodshed and release the peaceable inhabitants from all molestation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/20.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">A man of Mount Ephraim.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Quest.</span> How can this be so when he is called a Benjamite, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/2_samuel/20-1.htm" title="And there happened to be there a man of Belial, whose name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew a trumpet, and said, We have no part in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to his tents, O Israel.">2 Samuel 20:1</a></span>? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Answ, </span> Either he was a Benjamite by birth, but dwelt in the tribe of Ephraim, as many did upon several occasions dwell out of their own tribes; or Mount Ephraim was a place in Benjamin, which might be so called, either because it was upon the borders of Ephraim, and looked towards it; or from some notable action or event of the Ephraimites in that place.

And it is not unlikely that this woman might be a governess in that city for though this office was commonly performed by men, yet were not the women wholly excluded, but sometimes employed in the government; as we see in Deborah, who judged Israel, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/judges/4-4.htm" title="And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged Israel at that time.">Judges 4:4</a></span>; and queen Athaliah, <span class="bld"> 2Ki 11</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/20.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Joab answered and said, far be it from me, far be it from me,....

Abela (<a href="/2_samuel/20-15.htm">2 Samuel 20:15</a>), or Abel (<a href="/2_samuel/20-18.htm">2 Samuel 20:18</a>), has been preserved in the large Christian village of Abil, a place with ruins, and called Abil-el-Kamh on account of its excellent wheat (Kamh), which lies to the north-west of Lake Huleh, upon a Tell on the eastern side of the river Derdra; not in Ibl-el-Hawa, a place to the north of this, upon the ridge between Merj Ayun and Wady et Teim (vid., Ritter, Erdk. xv. pp. 240, 241; Robinson, Bibl. Researches, pp. 372-3; and v. de Velde, Mem. p. 280). Beth-maacah was quite close to Abela; so that the names of the two places are connected together in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-15.htm">2 Samuel 20:15</a>, and afterwards, as Abel-beth-maacah (vid., <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/15-20.htm">1 Kings 15:20</a>, and <a href="/2_kings/15-29.htm">2 Kings 15:29</a>), also called Abel-maim in <a href="/2_chronicles/16-4.htm">2 Chronicles 16:4</a>. Berim is the name of a district which is unknown to us; and even the early translators did not know how to render it. There is nothing, however, either in the &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b9;&#769; is the lxx or the omnes viri electi of the Vulgate, to warrant an alteration of the text. The latter, in fact, rests upon a mere conjecture, which is altogether unsuitable; for the subject to &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1492;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; cannot be &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; on account of the vav consec., but must be obtained from &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500; &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1496;&#1497;. The Chethib &#1493;&#1497;&#1511;&#1500;&#1492;&#1493; is evidently a slip of the pen for &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1492;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;.</body></html>
