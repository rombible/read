(Comp. <a href="/2_samuel/24-14.htm" title="And David said to Gad, I am in a great strait: let us fall now into the hand of the LORD; for his mercies are great: and let me not fall into the hand of man.">2Samuel 24:14</a>.) He is, therefore, unwilling to have the ark carried with him lest he should seem to undertake to compel the Divine presence and blessing. He feels sure that if God so will, he shall be brought again in peace; but if not, yet he will perfectly submit himself to God’s ordering.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/15.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>15:24-30 David is very careful for the safety of the ark. It is right to be more concerned for the church's prosperity than our own; to prefer the success of the gospel above our own wealth, credit, ease, and safety. Observe with what satisfaction and submission David speaks of the Divine disposal. It is our interest, as well as our duty, cheerfully to acquiesce in the will of God, whatever befalls us. Let us see God's hand in all events; and that we may not be afraid of what shall be, let us see all events in God's hand. David's sin was ever before him, Ps 51:3; but never so plain, nor ever appearing so black as now. He never wept thus when Saul hunted him, but a wounded conscience makes troubles lie heavy, Ps 38:4.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Abiathar went up - i. e., continued to ascend the Mount of Olives.

Zadok also, and all the Levites &#8230;, bearing the ark&#8212;Knowing the strong religious feelings of the aged king, they brought it to accompany him in his distress. But as he could not doubt that both the ark and their sacred office would exempt them from the attacks of the rebels, he sent them back with it&#8212;not only that they might not be exposed to the perils of uncertain wandering, for he seems to place more confidence in the symbol of the divine presence than in God Himself&#8212;but that, by remaining in Jerusalem, they might render him greater service by watching the enemy's movements.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">I have no delight in thee; </span> I will not receive thee into my favour, nor restore thee to thy throne and city, and to the enjoyment of my ark and ordinances. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Here am I, </span> ready to obey him, and to submit to his will and pleasure concerning me. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/15.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But if he thus say, I have no delight in thee,....

He feels that God will not judge him by any mere outward sign or privilege, but in truth and equity. If he deserves condemnation, he will not escape it by carrying the ark about with him. If, on the contrary, God accepts him, he will restore him to the enjoyment of his spiritual privileges, and bring him back to worship at the place which he has chosen for his dwelling. We must notice that he addresses these words to Zadok, who had remained with the ark. This was natural if Abiathar was occupied in offering, but hard to understand if he had gone up, that is, in advance of the ark, to acquaint David with their purpose. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Thy coming is yesterday (from yesterday), and should I disturb thee to-day to go with us, when I am going just where I go?" i.e., wherever my way may lie (I go I know not whither; Chald.: cf. <a href="/1_samuel/23-13.htm">1 Samuel 23:13</a>). The Chethib &#1488;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1498; is a copyist's error. The thought requires the Hiphil &#1488;&#1504;&#1497;&#1506;&#1498; (Keri), as &#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506; in the Kal has the intransitive meaning, to totter, sway about, or move hither and thither. "Return and take thy brethren back; grace and truth be with thee." It is evidently more in accordance with the train of thought to separate &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1498; from the previous clause and connect it with &#1493;&#1488;&#1502;&#1514; &#1495;&#1505;&#1491;, though this is opposed to the accents, than to adopt the adverbial interpretation, "take back thy brethren with thee in grace and truth," as Maurer proposes. (For the thought itself, see <a href="/proverbs/3-3.htm">Proverbs 3:3</a>). The reference is to the grace and truth (faithfulness) of God, which David desired that Ittai should receive upon his way. In the Septuagint and Vulgate the passage is paraphrased thus: "Jehovah show thee grace and truth," after <a href="/2_samuel/2-6.htm">2 Samuel 2:6</a>; but it by no means follows from this that &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1498; &#1493;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; has fallen out of the Hebrew text. </body></html>
