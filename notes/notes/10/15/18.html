He took this resolve, as a penitent submitting to the rod. Before unrighteous Absalom he could justify himself, and stand out; but before the righteous God he must condemn himself, and yield to his judgments. Thus he accepts the punishment of his sin. And good men, when they themselves suffer, are anxious that others should not be led to suffer with them. He compelled none; those whose hearts were with Absalom, to Absalom let them go, and so shall their doom be. Thus Christ enlists none but willing followers. David cannot bear to think that Ittai, a stranger and an exile, a proselyte and a new convert, who ought to be encouraged and made easy, should meet with hard usage. But such value has Ittai for David's wisdom and goodness, that he will not leave him. He is a friend indeed, who loves at all times, and will adhere to us in adversity. Let us cleave to the Son of David, with full purpose of heart, and neither life nor death shall separate us from his love.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Passed on - Rather, "crossed" the Brook Kidron, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-22.htm">2 Samuel 15:22-23</a>.<p>Gittites - During David's residence in the country of the Philistines he attached such a band to himself; and after the settlement of his kingdom, and the subjugation of the Philistines, the band received recruits from Gath, perhaps with the king of Gath's consent.

During his wanderings David formed a corps of six hundred picked men, who were particularly distinguished as “David’s men.” They appear first at Keilah (<a href="/1_samuel/23-13.htm" title="Then David and his men, which were about six hundred, arose and departed out of Keilah, and went wherever they could go. And it was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah; and he declined to go forth.">1 Samuel 23:13</a>, cp. <a href="/1_samuel/22-2.htm" title="And every one that was in distress, and every one that was in debt, and every one that was discontented, gathered themselves to him; and he became a captain over them: and there were with him about four hundred men.">1 Samuel 22:2</a>), were with him in the wilderness of Paran (<a href="/1_samuel/25-13.htm" title="And David said to his men, Gird you on every man his sword. And they girded on every man his sword; and David also girded on his sword: and there went up after David about four hundred men; and two hundred stayed by the stuff.">1 Samuel 25:13</a>), followed him to Gath (<a href="/context/1_samuel/27-2.htm" title="And David arose, and he passed over with the six hundred men that were with him to Achish, the son of Maoch, king of Gath....">1 Samuel 27:2-3</a>) and Ziklag (<a href="/1_samuel/27-8.htm" title="And David and his men went up, and invaded the Geshurites, and the Gezrites, and the Amalekites: for those nations were of old the inhabitants of the land, as you go to Shur, even to the land of Egypt.">1 Samuel 27:8</a>, <a href="/1_samuel/29-1.htm" title="Now the Philistines gathered together all their armies to Aphek: and the Israelites pitched by a fountain which is in Jezreel.">1 Samuel 29:1</a>, <a href="/1_samuel/30-1.htm" title="And it came to pass, when David and his men were come to Ziklag on the third day, that the Amalekites had invaded the south, and Ziklag, and smitten Ziklag, and burned it with fire;">1 Samuel 30:1</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/30-9.htm" title="So David went, he and the six hundred men that were with him, and came to the brook Besor, where those that were left behind stayed.">1 Samuel 30:9</a>), came up with him to Hebron (<a href="/1_samuel/2-3.htm" title="Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let not arrogance come out of your mouth: for the LORD is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed.">1 Samuel 2:3</a>), and finally to Jerusalem (<a href="/2_samuel/15-6.htm" title="And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.">2 Samuel 15:6</a>). This corps seems to have been afterwards maintained as a guard with the title of “the Gibbôrîm,” that is, “the Heroes” or “the Mighty Men” (cp. ch. <a href="/2_samuel/10-7.htm" title="And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men.">2 Samuel 10:7</a>, <a href="/2_samuel/16-6.htm" title="And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left.">2 Samuel 16:6</a>, <a href="/2_samuel/20-7.htm" title="And there went out after him Joab's men, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men: and they went out of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.">2 Samuel 20:7</a>; <a href="/1_kings/1-8.htm" title="But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men which belonged to David, were not with Adonijah.">1 Kings 1:8</a>), and it is natural to identify the six hundred here mentioned with that body. Some critics think that without altering the reading, we should identify the Gittites with the Gibbôrîm, and suppose that they were called Gittites either because they had followed David ever since his residence in Gath; or because the corps had at this time been largely recruited from the natives of Gath.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Sept. text of <span class="ital"><a href="/2_samuel/15-18.htm" title="And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men which came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.">2 Samuel 15:18</a></span> is as follows: “And all his servants passed on beside him, and all the Cherethites and all the Pelethites, and halted at the olive tree in the wilderness. And all the people marched by close to him, and all his attendants, and all the mighty men, and all the warriors, six hundred men, and were present by his side; and all the Cherethites and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, the six hundred men who came after him from Gath, marched on before the king.” This appears to be the rendering of a text differing somewhat from the present Hebrew, to which has been added a rendering of the present Hebrew text, with some further glosses or alternative renderings. “The olive tree in the wilderness,” which marked the scene of the second halt, (if the reading is genuine and not a mere mistranslation), was probably beyond the Mount of Olives on the road to the Jordan.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All the Gittites, air hundred men which came after him from Gath.</span> The Septuagint reads "Gibborim," and without doubt these are the persons meant; but while they were styled Gibborim, the "mighties," for honour's sake, because of their prowess, they probably were popularly called David's Gittites, because they were the six hundred men who had formed his little army when he sought refuge with Achish, King of Gath (l <a href="/1_samuel/27-2.htm">1 Samuel 27:2</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/30-9.htm">1 Samuel 30:9</a>). They were not Philistines, but Israelites of desperate fortune (<a href="/1_samuel/22-2.htm">1 Samuel 22:2</a>); and it is a proof of David's great ability, and of the moral influence of his character, that he was successful, not only in controlling them and maintaining discipline, but also in forming them into as noble a set of heroes as ever existed, and who were faithful to him in all his fortunes. To their number belonged the thirty-seven champions end-merated in ch. 23, and possibly the title "Gibborim" strictly belonged to them only. As they are still called "the six hundred," it is probable that the corps was maintained at this number by new appointments, and that they had special privileges which made their position very desirable. Certainly David would never forget men who had shared all his fortunes, and been so true and so useful to him; and it is evident, from Hushai's counsel (<a href="/2_samuel/17-8.htm">2 Samuel 17:8</a>), that Absalom feared their resolute valour, and hesitated to attack without overwhelming numbers. Thenius compares these veterans to Napoleon's Old Guard. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Moreover, Absalom sent for Ahithophel, David's councillor, to come from his own town Giloh, when he offered the sacrifices. The unusual construction of &#1488;&#1514; &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495; with &#1502;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512;&#1493; may be explained from the pregnant character of the expression: he sent and bade come, i.e., he summoned Ahithophel out of his city. Giloh, Ahithophel's home, was upon the mountains of Judah, to the south or south-west of Hebron (see at <a href="/joshua/15-51.htm">Joshua 15:51</a>). Ahithophel had no doubt been previously initiated into Absalom's plans, and had probably gone to his native city, merely that he might come to him with the greater ease; since his general place of abode, as king's councillor, must have been in Jerusalem. "And the conspiracy became strong; for the people multiplied continually with Absalom" (the latter is a circumstantial clause). These words give a condensed summary of the result of the enterprise. </body></html>
