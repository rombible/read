This gives no indication of the relations existing between the two, but merely shows how matters went on this day of hurry and confusion. The language is obscure, but probably means that Zadok and the Levites brought the ark out of the city, and set it down while the multitude were assembling; meantime Abiathar led the multitude forward up the Mount of Olives until they had all come out of the city.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/2_samuel/15.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/2_samuel/15-24.htm" title="And see Zadok also, and all the Levites were with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God: and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had done passing out of the city.">2 Samuel 15:24</a></span>. <span class="ital">Zadok also, and all the Levites were with him — </span>They knew David’s great regard for them and their office, notwithstanding his failings; and the arts which Absalom had used to gain the people’s affections had made no impression upon them.

It is right to be more concerned for the church's prosperity than our own; to prefer the success of the gospel above our own wealth, credit, ease, and safety. Observe with what satisfaction and submission David speaks of the Divine disposal. It is our interest, as well as our duty, cheerfully to acquiesce in the will of God, whatever befalls us. Let us see God's hand in all events; and that we may not be afraid of what shall be, let us see all events in God's hand. David's sin was ever before him, Ps 51:3; but never so plain, nor ever appearing so black as now.

Meanwhile Abiathar went on up the Mount of Olives, for some purpose which is not stated, possibly to watch the stream of people coming out of the city. He then returned to carry the Ark back. It seems best to suppose that the narrative goes back here, and that the Ark was not taken across the Kidron. Certainly it does not seem to have been carried up the Mount of Olives.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Abiathar went up.</span> This rendering, though confirmed by the versions, is very unintelligible. Whither did Abiathar go up? And moreover it is said that he continued going up until all David's followers had passed out of the city. Another possible rendering is, "And Abiathar offered (sacrifices) until all the people had done passing out of the city." Passages quoted in proof that the verb may be so rendered without the addition of the word "sacrifice" are <a href="/1_samuel/2-28.htm">1 Samuel 2:28</a> and <a href="/2_samuel/24-22.htm">2 Samuel 24:22</a>; but in both these places the context makes the sense plain. Such a sacrifice would, of course, sanctify both king and people in their flight; but as none of the versions support this method of translating the text, it seems unsafe to adopt it, and the passage must remain obscure. On the one hand, it is unlikely that there would be time to offer sacrifices at so hasty a flight; but on the other hand, the removal of the ark was a solemn thing, which probably required some such religious ceremonial, and Cahen and other Jewish authorities translate, "Abiathar offered burnt offerings." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>And all his servants, i.e., his state officers and attendants, went along by his side, and the whole body-guard (the Crethi and Plethi: see at <a href="/2_samuel/8-18.htm">2 Samuel 8:18</a>); and all the Gathites, namely the six hundred men who had come in his train from Gath, went along in front of the king. David directed the fugitives to all into rank, the servants going by his side, and the body-guard and the six hundred old companions in arms, who probably also formed a kind of body-guard, marching in front. The verb &#1506;&#1489;&#1512; (passed on) cannot be understood as signifying to file past on account of its connection with &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493; (beside him, or by his side). The expression Gittim is strange, as we cannot possibly think of actual Gathites or Philistines from Gath. The apposition (the six hundred men, etc.) shows clearly enough that the six hundred old companions in arms are intended, the men who gathered round David on his flight from Saul and emigrated with him to Gath (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/27-2.htm">1 Samuel 27:2-3</a>), who afterwards lived with him in Ziklag (<a href="/1_samuel/27-8.htm">1 Samuel 27:8</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/29-2.htm">1 Samuel 29:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-1.htm">1 Samuel 30:1</a>, <a href="/1_samuel/30-9.htm">1 Samuel 30:9</a>), and eventually followed him to Hebron and Jerusalem (<a href="/2_samuel/2-3.htm">2 Samuel 2:3</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/5-6.htm">2 Samuel 5:6</a>). In all probability they formed a separate company of well-tried veterans or a kind of body-guard in Jerusalem, and were commonly known as Gathites.<p>(Note: The Septuagint also has &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788; &#x393;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;, and has generally rendered the Masoretic text correctly. But &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1497;&#1493; has been translated incorrectly, or at all events in a manner likely to mislead, viz., &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;. But in the Septuagint text, as it has come down to us, another paraphrase has been interpolated into the literal translation, which Thenius would adopt as an emendation of the Hebrew text, notwithstanding the fact that the critical corruptness of the Alexandrian text must be obvious to every one.) </body></html>
