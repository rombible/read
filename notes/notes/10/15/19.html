From the fact that David afterwards entrusted him with the command of a third of his forces, it is clear that he must have been an experienced general. It cannot be shown positively that he was a proselyte, although this is probable.<p>In the latter part of this verse the English has unnecessarily changed the order of the words. Read, “Return and abide with the king, for thou art a stranger and an exile at thy place,” viz., at Jerusalem.

He took this resolve, as a penitent submitting to the rod. Before unrighteous Absalom he could justify himself, and stand out; but before the righteous God he must condemn himself, and yield to his judgments. Thus he accepts the punishment of his sin. And good men, when they themselves suffer, are anxious that others should not be led to suffer with them. He compelled none; those whose hearts were with Absalom, to Absalom let them go, and so shall their doom be. Thus Christ enlists none but willing followers. David cannot bear to think that Ittai, a stranger and an exile, a proselyte and a new convert, who ought to be encouraged and made easy, should meet with hard usage. But such value has Ittai for David's wisdom and goodness, that he will not leave him. He is a friend indeed, who loves at all times, and will adhere to us in adversity. Let us cleave to the Son of David, with full purpose of heart, and neither life nor death shall separate us from his love.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Passed on - Rather, "crossed" the Brook Kidron, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-22.htm">2 Samuel 15:22-23</a>.<p>Gittites - During David's residence in the country of the Philistines he attached such a band to himself; and after the settlement of his kingdom, and the subjugation of the Philistines, the band received recruits from Gath, perhaps with the king of Gath's consent.

From the fact that he shared the command of the army with Joab and Abishai (ch. <a href="/2_samuel/18-2.htm" title="And David sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite.

If we may suppose this to have been the case, it gives additional delicacy to David’s thought fulness in wishing to spare him the repetition of hardships he had but lately experienced.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ittai the Gittite.</span> Ittai was not one of the six hundred, though there was an Ittai among them, a Benjamite. He was a citizen of Gath, who had lately come ("yesterday," see ver. 20), with all his household of slaves and dependents, his clan, Hebrew, his <span class="accented">taf</span> - translated in ver. 22 his "little ones." He had evidently been a person of importance in his own country,  whence he had been driven, perhaps by political troubles, and was now, therefore, an exile and a foreigner (Authorized Version, "stranger") at Jerusalem. As David made him joint commander of his army with Joab and Abishai (<a href="/2_samuel/18-2.htm">2 Samuel 18:2</a>), he must also have been a general of recognized military skill. As he was thus not personally interested in the government of Israel, and, in fact, had only lately come thither, David recommends him to <span class="cmt_word">return...  and abide with the king,</span> that is, with the <span class="accented">de facto</span> king, Absalom. But so great was the fascination which David exercised upon those around him, that this foreigner boldly threw in his lot with him, and accompanied him in his flight. Return to thy place. This is a very daring transposition, as the Hebrew is, <span class="accented">Return and abide with the king</span>; <span class="accented">for thou art a foreigner, and also an exile art thou to thy place.</span> The Revised Version gives the same sense as the Authorized, though it shows more respect to the grammar. But the Septuagint, Syriac, and Vulgate, by "his own place" understand Gath, either taking the words as meaning "an exile as to thy own place," or having a different reading. The Hebrew then proceeds, <span class="accented">Yesterday was thy coming, and shall</span> 1 <span class="accented">today make thee wander to go with us, seeing I go whither I go?</span> that is, I go I know not whither. <span class="accented">Return thou, and take back thy brethren - in mercy and truth.</span> This gives a very good sense, but the Septuagint and Vulgate have a different reading: "Take back thy brethren with thee, and the Lord chew thee mercy and truth." The Syriac gives the genera] sense of the Hebrew, rendering, "Take back thy brethren well." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>David's flight from Jerusalem. - <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-13.htm">2 Samuel 15:13</a>, <a href="/2_samuel/15-14.htm">2 Samuel 15:14</a>. When this intelligence reached David, "The heart of the men of Israel is after Absalom" (&#1488;&#1492;&#1512; &#1492;&#1497;&#1492;, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-10.htm">2 Samuel 2:10</a>, to be attached to a person as king; see at <a href="/1_samuel/12-14.htm">1 Samuel 12:14</a>), he said to his servants that were with him in Jerusalem, "Arise, let us flee, for there will be no escape for us from Absalom! Make speed to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly, and drive the calamity (the judgment threatened in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-10.htm">2 Samuel 12:10-11</a>) over us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword." David was perhaps afraid that Jerusalem might fall into Absalom's power through treachery, and therefore resolved to fly as speedily as possible, not only in order to prevent a terrible massacre, but also to give his own faithful adherents time to assemble. </body></html>
