He took this resolve, as a penitent submitting to the rod. Before unrighteous Absalom he could justify himself, and stand out; but before the righteous God he must condemn himself, and yield to his judgments. Thus he accepts the punishment of his sin. And good men, when they themselves suffer, are anxious that others should not be led to suffer with them. He compelled none; those whose hearts were with Absalom, to Absalom let them go, and so shall their doom be. Thus Christ enlists none but willing followers. David cannot bear to think that Ittai, a stranger and an exile, a proselyte and a new convert, who ought to be encouraged and made easy, should meet with hard usage. But such value has Ittai for David's wisdom and goodness, that he will not leave him. He is a friend indeed, who loves at all times, and will adhere to us in adversity. Let us cleave to the Son of David, with full purpose of heart, and neither life nor death shall separate us from his love.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And smite the city - David's kind nature induced him to spare Jerusalem the horrors of a siege, and the risk of being taken by assault.

We must suppose the sending the spies to have been contemporaneous with the removal of Absalom to Hebron, so that &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495; is used quite regularly, and there is no reason for translating it as a pluperfect. The messengers sent out are called "spies," because they were first of all to ascertain the feelings of the people in the different tribes, and were only to execute their commission in places where they could reckon upon support. The conspiracy had hitherto been kept very secret, as we may see from the statement in <a href="/2_samuel/15-11.htm">2 Samuel 15:11</a> : "With Absalom there had gone two hundred men out of Jerusalem, invited (to the sacrificial festival), and going in their simplicity, who knew nothing at all of the affair."
