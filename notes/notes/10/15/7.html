Absalom was born after David began his reign in Hebron, and his whole reign was only forty years. Absalom therefore was not yet forty at his death. The reading found in the Syriac and most MSS. of the Vulgate, and adopted by Josephus, <span class= "ital">four </span>years, is probably correct.

Hebron was the place of his birth and childhood, as well as a holy city from very ancient times, and was thus a suitable place for the performance of his vow; it was also at a convenient distance from Jerusalem, and had been the royal city of David for the first seven years of his reign. It was thus well adapted to be the starting place of Absalom’s rebellion, and it is not unlikely, moreover, that the men of Hebron may have resented the transfer of the capital to Jerusalem, and therefore have lent a willing ear to Absalom. Like many other culprits, Absalom veils his crime under the cloak of religion, pretending submission to his father, and receiving his blessing at the very moment when he is striking at his crown and his life.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/2_samuel/15.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/2_samuel/15-7.htm" title="And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said to the king, I pray you, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed to the LORD, in Hebron.">2 Samuel 15:7</a></span>. <span class="ital">After forty years — </span>That is, as some say, from the change of the government into a monarchy, which change took place about ten years before David began to reign.

Josephus, Theodoret, the manuscripts mentioned in the Benedictine edition of Jerome’s version, the canon of the Hebrew verity, (supposed to be made about the ninth century, and altered by some correcting hand,) the reading of the famous Latin Bible of Sextus, the Latin manuscript in Exeter college library, marked C. 2. 13., and the ancient Latin manuscript written in Gothic characters, the variations of which are published in Blanchini’s <span class="ital">Vindiciæ, </span>all have it, four; so that Grotius, and, after him, Patrick, were well supported in having pronounced so decisively, that it would admit of no doubt that an error had crept into the text, and that instead of <span class="greekheb">ארבעים</span>, <span class="ital">arbagnim, forty, </span>should be read <span class="greekheb">ארבע</span>, <span class="ital">arbang, four. </span>See Kennicott’s <span class="ital">Dissert., </span>vol. 2. p. 358, and Houbigant’s note. <span class="ital">Let me go and pay my vow which I have vowed to the Lord in Hebron — </span>To wit, to perform there by some solemn sacrifice. As Delaney is of opinion that a very grievous sickness of David gave Absalom occasion to take the forementioned steps, so he thinks that his father’s unexpected recovery, perhaps through God’s extraordinary influence, broke Absalom’s measures for some time, and made him postpone his wicked purpose. In the mean time, his popularity had all the field he could wish. As all the people of Israel resorted to Jerusalem thrice in every year, on the three solemn festivals, he had so often an opportunity of paying his court, and insinuating his poison, till the infection spread through the whole body of the realm, and wanted nothing but a fair occasion to display itself in all its malignity, which Absalom sought by going to Hebron.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/15.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>15:7-12 See how willing tender parents are to believe the best concerning their children.

It was a natural center, had probably many inhabitants discontented at the transfer of the government to Jerusalem, and contained many of the friends of Absalom's youth. As the place of his birth (compare <a href="/1_samuel/20-6.htm">1 Samuel 20:6</a>), it afforded a plausible pretext for holding there the great sacrificial feast ("the serving the Lord," <a href="/2_samuel/15-8.htm">2 Samuel 15:8</a>), which Absalom pretended to have vowed to hold to the glory of God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7-9. after forty years&#8212;It is generally admitted that an error has here crept into the text, and that instead of "forty," we should read with the Syriac and Arabic versions, and Josephus, "four years"&#8212;that is, after Absalom's return to Jerusalem, and his beginning to practice the base arts of gaining popularity.<p>my vow, which I have vowed unto the Lord&#8212;during his exile in Geshur. The purport of it was, that whenever God's providence should pave the way for his re-establishment in Jerusalem, he would offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving. Hebron was the spot selected for the performance of this vow, ostensibly as being his native place (2Sa 3:3), and a famous high place, where sacrifices were frequently offered before the temple was built; but really as being in many respects the most suitable for the commencement of his rebellious enterprise. David, who always encouraged piety and desired to see religious engagements punctually performed, gave his consent and his blessing.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">After forty years.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Quest.</span> Whence are these to be computed? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Answ</span>.

So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.">1 Samuel 16:13</a></span>. Or, secondly, From the beginning of Saul’s reign; which being a solemn time, and observable for the change of the government in Israel, might very fitly be made an epochs, from which the computation or account of times begin; as the Greeks and Romans began their accounts in the same manner, and upon the same ground. Or rather, thirdly, From the beginning of David’s reign, who reigned forty years; and so the words may be rendered, <span class="ital">about or towards the end of forty years</span>, i. e. in the beginning of the fortieth year. And so this very phrase is used <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/deuteronomy/15-1.htm" title="At the end of every seven years you shall make a release.">Deu 15:1</a></span>, <span class="ital">At the end of every seven years</span>, i.e. in the seventh year, even from the beginning of it, as is manifested and confessed. So in a like expression, <span class="ital">After three days will I rise again</span>, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/mark/8-31.htm" title="And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders, and of the chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.">Mark 8:31</a></span>, i.e. on the beginning of the third day, when Christ did rise; the number of three days being then completed when the third day is begun. And the forty years are here expressed as one motive or inducement to Absalom to rebel, because now his father’s end grew near; and one of the Hebrew doctors affirms, that there was a tradition, or rumour, or prediction, that David should reign but forty years. And Absalom might easily understand that David intended to decline him, and to make Solomon his successor, as well by the conscience of his own wickedness and unfitness for so great a trust, as by that eminent wisdom and piety which appeared in Solomon in his tender years, and that great respect and affection which his father must needs have and manifest to him upon this account, and by that promise and oath given to Bathsheba concerning his succession mentioned <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/1_kings/1-30.htm" title="Even as I swore to you by the LORD God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne in my stead; even so will I certainly do this day.">1 Kings 1:30</a></span>, but made before that time, which also might come to Absalom’s ear. Against this opinion two things are objected: first, That David was in the time of this rebellion a strong man, for he marched on foot, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/2_samuel/15-30.htm" title="And David went up by the ascent of mount Olivet, and wept as he went up, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot: and all the people that was with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up.">2 Samuel 15:30</a></span>, whereas in his last year he was very infirm and bedrid. Secondly, That after this rebellion was ended divers other things happened, as the three years’ famine, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/2_samuel/21-1.htm" title="Then there was a famine in the days of David three years, year after year; and David inquired of the LORD. And the LORD answered, It is for Saul, and for his bloody house, because he slew the Gibeonites.">2 Samuel 21:1</a></span>, and other things following in the history. But it may be answered to the first, that David might in the beginning of his last year have so much strength and vigour left as to march on foot, especially when he did so humble and afflict himself, as it is apparent he did, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/2_samuel/15-30.htm" title="And David went up by the ascent of mount Olivet, and wept as he went up, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot: and all the people that was with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up.">2 Samuel 15:30</a></span>; and yet through his tedious marches, and the tormenting cares, fears, and griefs of his soul for Absalom, might be so strangely and suddenly impaired, as in the end of the same year to be very feeble and bedrid, it being a very common accident, especially in old men, and upon extraordinary occasions, to languish and decline exceedingly, and to fall from some competent degree of health and rigour, to be very infirm and bedrid, and that in the space of a few months. And to the second objection, That those histories related <span class="bld"> 2Sa 21</span>, &c., though they be placed after this rebellion, yet indeed were done before it; the proof of which see on <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/2_samuel/21-1.htm" title="Then there was a famine in the days of David three years, year after year; and David inquired of the LORD. And the LORD answered, It is for Saul, and for his bloody house, because he slew the Gibeonites.">2 Samuel 21:1</a></span>. For it is so confessed and evident, that things are not always placed in the same order in which they were done, that it is a rule of the Hebrews, and approved by other learned men, Non datur pri us et posterius in Saetia literis; that is, <span class="ital">There is no first and last in the order of Scripture relations</span>. And here is a plain reason for this transplacing of this history, which is allowed in other like cases, that when once the history of Tamar’s rape had been mentioned, it was very fit to subjoin the relation of all the mischiefs which followed upon that occasion. If any infidel will yet cavil with this text and number of years, let him know, that instead of <span class="ital">forty</span>, the Syriac, and Arabic, and Josephus the Jew read <span class="ital">four years</span>; and that it is much more rational to acknowledge an error of the scribe, who copied out the sacred text, than upon so frivolous a ground to question the Divine authority of the Holy Scriptures. And that some men choose the latter way rather than the former, is an evidence that they are infidels by the choice of their wills, more than by the strength of their reasons. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Let me go and pay my vow</span>: he pretends piety, which he knew would please his father, and easily procure his consent. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Hebron</span> is mentioned as the place, not where the vow was made, for that was at Geshur, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/2_samuel/15-8.htm" title="For your servant vowed a vow while I stayed at Geshur in Syria, saying, If the LORD shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem, then I will serve the LORD.">2 Samuel 15:8</a></span>, but where he intended to perform it.

Or four years; so long it was from the reconciliation of Absalom to David, as Josephus (f) says; and so read Theodoret on the place, the Syriac and Arabic versions: but some say it was either forty years from the time Israel first had a king; and which might be an era of reckoning with the Jews, as the era of Seleucidae was with the Greeks, on the like account; or from the time Saul slew the priests at Nob, as Jerom (g); or from the time of David's being anointed by Samuel; or this was the year of Absalom's age, or of David's reign: but these, and other attempts made to account for this passage, are not entirely satisfactory; and therefore one may be tempted to conclude there must be a mistake in the copy, of "arbaim" for "arba", forty for four; which makes it quite easy, and confirms the first sense: <p>that Absalom said unto the king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow,  <p>which I have vowed unto the Lord, in Hebron; not what he vowed in Hebron; for according to his own account he had vowed it in Geshur, as in <a href="/2_samuel/15-8.htm">2 Samuel 15:8</a>; but his request is, that he might pay it in Hebron; which place he fixed upon, being his native place, and where David was anointed king; and which, being about twenty miles from Jerusalem, was at a proper distance to lay the scene of his conspiracy in, and bring it to perfection. <p>(f) Antiqu. l. 7. c. 9. sect. 1.((g) Trad.

In place of <span class="ital">forty</span> we must read <span class="bld">four</span> with Josephus and some of the ancient versions. The four years are to be reckoned in all probability from the time of Absalom’s reconciliation to David. They were spent in preparing for the conspiracy by ingratiating himself with the people in the way described in the preceding verses.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in Hebron</span>] The fact that Hebron was his birth-place would make the wish to pay his vow there instead of at Jerusalem seem sufficiently natural.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">After forty years.</span> As Absalom was born in Hebron after David was made king (<a href="/2_samuel/3-3.htm">2 Samuel 3:3</a>), and as David's whole reign lasted only forty years and six months, the reading "forty" is evidently incorrect. Suggestions, such, for instance, as that the forty years are to be reckoned from the desire of the Israelites to have a king, or from the anointing of David by Samuel, are merely methods of evading a difficulty. The Syriac, however, and the Vulgate - except the Codex Amiatinus, which reads "forty," supported by Josephus and some manuscripts have "four years," which would give ample, yet not too long, time for the growth of Absalom's popularity, and of dissatisfaction at David's tardy administration of justice. <span class="cmt_word">In Hebron.</span> Absalom chose this town, beth as being his birthplace, and also because it was on the road to Geshur (<a href="/1_samuel/27-8.htm">1 Samuel 27:8</a>), whither flight might be necessary should the enterprise fail. He hoped also to win to his cause some of the powerful tribe of Judah, though it generally was the mainstay of David's throne. Local sacrifices were still customary (see note on 1 Samuel 16:2), and the visit of the king's son for such a purpose would be celebrated by a general holiday and much feasting at Hebron. As Ewald remarks, David's confidence and want of suspicion were the results of a noble-minded generosity. And besides, there was no state police ever on the watch, and ready to put an unfavourable construction on all that was done; and probably David was even pleased at his son's popularity, and took his professions as proof that he would be a just and wise ruler on succeeding to his father's place. Perhaps, too, he was glad at this indication of religious feeling on Absalom's part; for a father is sure to look on the better side of his son's acts. He had been tardy enough in fulfilling his vow, but it seemed to David that conscience had at last prevailed, and that right was to be done. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Absalom seeks to secure the people's favour. - <a href="/2_samuel/15-1.htm">2 Samuel 15:1</a>.

He then went early in the morning to the side of the road to the gate of the palace, and called out to every one who was about to go to the king "for judgment," i.e., seek justice in connection with any matter in dispute, and asked him, "Of what city art thou?" and also, as we may see from the reply in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-3.htm">2 Samuel 15:3</a>, inquired into his feelings towards the king, and then said, "Thy matters are good and right, but there is no hearer for thee with the king." &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; signifies the judicial officer, who heard complainants and examined into their different causes, for the purpose of laying them before the king for settlement. Of course the king himself could not give a hearing to every complainant, and make a personal investigation of his cause; nor could his judges procure justice for every complainant, however justly they might act, though it is possible that they may not always have performed their duty conscientiously.</body></html>
