It was a natural center, had probably many inhabitants discontented at the transfer of the government to Jerusalem, and contained many of the friends of Absalom's youth. As the place of his birth (compare <a href="/1_samuel/20-6.htm">1 Samuel 20:6</a>), it afforded a plausible pretext for holding there the great sacrificial feast ("the serving the Lord," <a href="/2_samuel/15-8.htm">2 Samuel 15:8</a>), which Absalom pretended to have vowed to hold to the glory of God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2Sa 15:10-12.

As the summons was to be made by the sound of trumpets, it is probable that care had been taken to have trumpeters stationed on the heights, and at convenient stations&#8212;a mode of announcement that would soon spread the news over all the country of his inauguration to the throne.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Absalom sent</span> from Hebron; or, had sent from Jerusalem; that when he went to Hebron, they should go into the several tribes to sift the people, and to dispose them to Absalom’s party, and acquaint them with his success. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet; </span> which I shall take care to have sounded in several parts by other persons; and when that is done, you shall inform them of the reason of it.

He was to be proclaimed king simultaneously all over the country. Cp. ch. <a href="/2_samuel/20-1.htm" title="And there happened to be there a man of Belial, whose name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew a trumpet, and said, We have no part in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to his tents, O Israel.">2 Samuel 20:1</a>; <a href="/1_kings/1-34.htm" title="And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel: and blow you with the trumpet, and say, God save king Solomon.">1 Kings 1:34</a>; <a href="/2_kings/9-13.htm" title="Then they hurried, and took every man his garment, and put it under him on the top of the stairs, and blew with trumpets, saying, Jehu is king.">2 Kings 9:13</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in Hebron</span>] The choice of Hebron clearly shews that Absalom expected to find his chief support in the tribe of Judah. It is probable that the old tribal jealousies had been revived, and that Judah resented its absorption into the nation at large. Such a spirit of discontent would account for the slackness of Judah to bring back the king when the rebellion was over (ch. <a href="/2_samuel/19-11.htm" title="And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, Speak to the elders of Judah, saying, Why are you the last to bring the king back to his house? seeing the speech of all Israel is come to the king, even to his house.">2 Samuel 19:11</a>). Hebron itself too probably contained many persons who were aggrieved by the removal of the court to Jerusalem. See Ewald’s <span class="ital">Hist. of Israel</span>, III. 176.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Absalom sent spies.</span> The word means "those who go hither and thither," and, as the object of such journeying would usually be. to gather information, the right translation often is "spies." Here there was no such purpose, nor were they to report to Absalom, but to disperse themselves everywhere, and, when the signal was given at Hebron, they were to endeavour to gather the people to Absalom's standard. Some simple minded commentators wonder how one trumpet could be heard throughout the land. It was heard only at Hebron, but the news of the proclamation would rapidly spread; and, though the rumour might be vague and confused, yet these emissaries, fully acquainted beforehand with its meaning, would turn it to Absalom's advantage, and urge the people to confirm the choice, made, as they would affirm, by the whole tribe of Judah. In such attempts  everything depends upon gathering a powerful following at first; and usually a good deal of vigour and even force is necessary to make men take part in a revolt. But as the numbers swell, adherents readily flock in to what seems to be the winning side. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Absalom also said, "Oh that I might be judge in the land, and every one who had a cause might come before me; I would procure him justice!" &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1504;&#1497; &#1502;&#1497; is a wish: "who might (i.e., oh that one might) appoint me judge," an analogous expression to &#1497;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503; ot &#1502;&#1497; (vid., Gesenius, 136, 1, and Ewald, 329, c.). &#1506;&#1500;&#1497; placed before &#1497;&#1489;&#1488; for the sake of emphasis, may be explained from the fact that a judge sat, so that the person who stood before him rose above him (comp. <a href="/exodus/18-13.htm">Exodus 18:13</a> with <a href="/genesis/18-8.htm">Genesis 18:8</a>). &#1492;&#1510;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1511;, to speak justly, or help to justice.</body></html>
