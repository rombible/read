This, we may be sure, David was highly delighted to hear, and therefore gave a ready consent to the performance of his vow, saying, <span class="ital">Go in peace. So he arose and went to Hebron — </span>This place he chose as being an eminent city, and next to Jerusalem, the chief city of the tribe of Judah. It was also the place of his birth, the place where his father had begun his kingdom, which he took for a good omen, and where the seat of government had been several years. Here, likewise, they were wont to sacrifice till the temple was built. It was at a convenient distance from Jerusalem, and, no doubt, he had here secured many friends. He therefore thought it the most commodious place for his purpose, next to Jerusalem.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/15.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>15:7-12 See how willing tender parents are to believe the best concerning their children. But how easy and how wicked is it, for children to take advantage of good parents, and to deceive them with the show of religion! The principal men of Jerusalem joined Absalom's feast upon his sacrifice. Pious persons are glad to see others appear religious, and this gives occasion for deceptions. The policy of wicked men, and the subtlety of Satan, are exerted to draw good persons to countenance base designs.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Forty years - An obvious clerical error, though a very ancient one for four years, which may date from Absalom's return from Geshur, or from his reconciliation with David, or from the commencement of the criminal schemes to which <a href="/2_samuel/15-1.htm">2 Samuel 15:1</a> refers.<p>Hebron - This, as having been the old capital of David's kingdom and Absalom's birthplace, was well chosen. It was a natural center, had probably many inhabitants discontented at the transfer of the government to Jerusalem, and contained many of the friends of Absalom's youth. As the place of his birth (compare <a href="/1_samuel/20-6.htm">1 Samuel 20:6</a>), it afforded a plausible pretext for holding there the great sacrificial feast ("the serving the Lord," <a href="/2_samuel/15-8.htm">2 Samuel 15:8</a>), which Absalom pretended to have vowed to hold to the glory of God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7-9. after forty years&#8212;It is generally admitted that an error has here crept into the text, and that instead of "forty," we should read with the Syriac and Arabic versions, and Josephus, "four years"&#8212;that is, after Absalom's return to Jerusalem, and his beginning to practice the base arts of gaining popularity.<p>my vow, which I have vowed unto the Lord&#8212;during his exile in Geshur. The purport of it was, that whenever God's providence should pave the way for his re-establishment in Jerusalem, he would offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving. Hebron was the spot selected for the performance of this vow, ostensibly as being his native place (2Sa 3:3), and a famous high place, where sacrifices were frequently offered before the temple was built; but really as being in many respects the most suitable for the commencement of his rebellious enterprise. David, who always encouraged piety and desired to see religious engagements punctually performed, gave his consent and his blessing.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> i.e. Worship him by the offering of sacrifices of thanksgiving to God, for restoring me to the place of his presence and service, and to my father’s favour. But why should not this service have been performed at Zion, or at Gibeon? Here was some ground of suspicion; but God blinded David’s eyes, that he might bring upon David and upon Absalom the judgments which they deserved, and he designed. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/15.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria,....

He then went early in the morning to the side of the road to the gate of the palace, and called out to every one who was about to go to the king "for judgment," i.e., seek justice in connection with any matter in dispute, and asked him, "Of what city art thou?" and also, as we may see from the reply in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-3.htm">2 Samuel 15:3</a>, inquired into his feelings towards the king, and then said, "Thy matters are good and right, but there is no hearer for thee with the king." &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; signifies the judicial officer, who heard complainants and examined into their different causes, for the purpose of laying them before the king for settlement. Of course the king himself could not give a hearing to every complainant, and make a personal investigation of his cause; nor could his judges procure justice for every complainant, however justly they might act, though it is possible that they may not always have performed their duty conscientiously.</body></html>
