Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate&#8212;Public business in the East is always transacted early in the morning&#8212;the kings sitting an hour or more to hear causes or receive petitions, in a court held anciently, and in many places still, in the open air at the city gateway; so that, as those whose circumstances led them to wait on King David required to be in attendance on his morning levees, Absalom had to rise up early and stand beside the way of the gate. Through the growing infirmities of age, or the occupation of his government with foreign wars, many private causes had long lain undecided, and a deep feeling of discontent prevailed among the people. This dissatisfaction was artfully fomented by Absalom, who addressed himself to the various suitors; and after briefly hearing their tale, he gratified everyone with a favorable opinion of his case. Studiously concealing his ambitious designs, he expressed a wish to be invested with official power, only that he might accelerate the course of justice and advance the public interests. His professions had an air of extraordinary generosity and disinterestedness, which, together with his fawning arts in lavishing civilities on all, made him a popular favorite. Thus, by forcing a contrast between his own display of public spirit and the dilatory proceedings of the court, he created a growing disgust with his father's government, as weak, careless, or corrupt, and seduced the affections of the multitude, who neither penetrated the motive nor foresaw the tendency of his conduct.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Putting on the garb of singular humanity and good will to all men; for that seems to have been a ceremony in frequent use in those times of showing respect, as pulling off the hat, and bowing, or embracing, is at this day with us. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/15.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And it was so, that when any man came nigh to him to do him obeisance,....

This half forgiving was really worse than no forgiveness at all. Absalom might indeed very properly desire to be punished according to the law, if the king could not or might not forgive him; although the manner in which he sought to obtain forgiveness by force manifested an evident spirit of defiance, by which, with the well-known mildness of David's temper, he hoped to attain his object, and in fact did attain it. For (<a href="/2_samuel/14-33.htm">2 Samuel 14:33</a>) when Joab went to the king, and announced this to him, the king sent for Absalom, and kissed him, as a sign of his restoration to favour. Nothing was said by Absalom about forgiveness; for his falling down before the king when he came into his presence, was nothing more than the ordinary manifestation of reverence with which a subject in the East approaches his king. </body></html>
