The narrative simply states the facts without justifying them. But while we cannot too strongly condemn such a stratagem, two things are to be remembered: first, that like frauds in time of war and rebellion have been practised in all ages, and still continue; and, secondly, that David and Hushai had but slender knowledge of the Divine revelation of truth and righteousness which enables us to condemn them, and, therefore, did with a clear conscience many things which we see to be wrong.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/2_samuel/15.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/2_samuel/15-34.htm" title="But if you return to the city, and say to Absalom, I will be your servant, O king; as I have been your father's servant till now, so will I now also be your servant: then may you for me defeat the counsel of Ahithophel.">2 Samuel 15:34</a></span>. <span class="ital">Say unto Absalom, I will be thy servant, O king, </span>&c. — This crafty counsel of David to Hushai, advising him to use such great dissimulation, cannot be justified.

He prayed this, in firm belief that God has all hearts in his hand, and tongues also. But we must second our prayers with endeavours, and David did so, else we tempt God. But we do not find wisdom and simplicity so united in any mere man, that we can perceive nothing which needs forgiveness. Yet, when the Son of David was treated with all possible treachery and cruelty, his wisdom, meekness, candour, and patience, were perfect.

It is therefore curiously instructive to see it made the warrant of a similarly questionable act in modern times. Sir Samuel Morland, Secretary of State to Cromwell, in describing his betrayal of his master to Charles II., says, ‘I called to remembrance Hushai’s behaviour towards Absalom, which I found not at all blamed in Holy Writ, and yet his was a larger step than mine.’ ” Stanley’s <span class="ital">Lect.</span> II, 99. Stratagems of this kind, involving deliberate falsehood and treachery, have been employed in all ages, but the morality of them cannot be approved. In connexion with this question it may be remarked, (1) that wrong actions are often related in Scripture without express condemnation, because the healthy and enlightened conscience can discern at once they are wrong: (2) that many actions, allowable under the Old Testament dispensation, are not allowable to those who have received the light of Christ’s revelation: (3) that Scripture gives no sanction to the doctrine, maintained even now in some quarters, that political and social morality are not governed by the same rules. See also the notes on <a href="/1_samuel/27-11.htm" title="And David saved neither man nor woman alive, to bring tidings to Gath, saying, Lest they should tell on us, saying, So did David, and so will be his manner all the while he dwells in the country of the Philistines.">1 Samuel 27:11</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/29-8.htm" title="And David said to Achish, But what have I done? and what have you found in your servant so long as I have been with you to this day, that I may not go fight against the enemies of my lord the king?">1 Samuel 29:8</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then mayest thou for me defeat the counsel of Ahithophel.</span> David was thus meeting treachery by treachery, and we cannot approve of it, even granting that Ahithophel's conduct was base and selfish,  while Hushai was risking his life for his master. Still, he was sent back to tell a falsehood, and his excuse was necessity; for Ahithophel was so sagacious that, if his counsel were not upset, David's cause was lost. It was not Christian morality, but yet it has a sort of nobleness about it in Hushai's devotion to his king. And even now, in war and diplomacy, such acts are not uncommon, and a distinction is unhappily drawn between political and social morality. Even in common life immoral doings are often sanctioned by use. Thus many customs of trade are frauds, considered legitimate because generally practised. Even among ourselves Christian morality is far below the level of our Master's teaching; and the Old Testament must not be taken as approving all that it records. Similar blame does not attach to Zadok and Abiathar. They were known to be David's friends, and had even tried to go with him, bearing with them the ark. They professed no friendship for Absalom, and returned for no covert purpose, looking for protection, not to guile, but to their sacred office. And Absalom would be glad to have them in his power, and would make them continue the customary sacrifices, and, if his rebellion proved successful, would force them to anoint him, and so give his usurpation a religious sanction. But he would tell them none of his plans, nor would they try to insinuate themselves into his confidence. They would have a perfect right to be useful in any way they could to their true master, but would do so at the risk of severe punishment. Hushai's way of defeating Ahithophel was treacherous; but there was no deceit in the young men carrying a message from him, for they were openly David's friends. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>He also said still further to Zadok, "Thou seer! return into the city in peace." &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; &#1492;&#1512;&#1493;&#1488;&#1492;, with &#1492; interrog., does not yield any appropriate sense, as &#1492; cannot stand for &#1492;&#1500;&#1493;&#1488; here, simply because it does not relate to a thing which the person addressed could not deny. Consequently the word must be pointed thus, &#1492;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; (with the article), and rendered as a vocative, as it has been by Jerome and Luther. &#1512;&#1488;&#1492;, seer, is equivalent to prophet. He applies this epithet to Zadok, as the high priest who received divine revelations by means of the Urim. The meaning is, Thou Zadok art equal to a prophet; therefore thy proper place is in Jerusalem (O. v. Gerlach). Zadok was to stand as it were upon the watch there with Abiathar, and the sons of both to observe the events that occurred, and send him word through their sons into the plain of the Jordan. "Behold, I will tarry by the ferries of the desert, till a word comes from you to show me," sc., what has taken place, or how the things shape themselves in Jerusalem. Instead of &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, the earlier translators as well as the Masoretes adopted the reading &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;, "in the steppes of the desert." The allusion in this case would be to the steppes of Jericho (<a href="/2_kings/25-5.htm">2 Kings 25:5</a>). But Bttcher has very properly defended the Chethib on the strength of <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-16.htm">2 Samuel 17:16</a>, where the Keri has &#1506;&#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; again, though &#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; is the true reading (cf. <a href="/2_samuel/19-19.htm">2 Samuel 19:19</a>). The "ferries of the desert" are the places where the Jordan could be crossed, the fords of the Jordan (<a href="/joshua/2-7.htm">Joshua 2:7</a>; <a href="/judges/3-28.htm">Judges 3:28</a>).</body></html>
