Why he deserted David does not appear. It has been conjectured that he was aggrieved at David’s treatment of Bath-sheba, who is supposed to have been his granddaughter. Bath-sheba’s father was Eliam (<a href="/2_samuel/11-3.htm" title="And David sent and inquired after the woman. And one said, Is not this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?">2Samuel 11:3</a>) and Ahithophel had a son Eliam (<a href="/2_samuel/23-34.htm" title="Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai, the son of the Maachathite, Eliam the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite,">2Samuel 23:34</a>), but there is no evidence that these were the same, and if they had been, Ahithophel probably would have felt honoured rather than aggrieved that his daughter should have been made queen. It is more likely that Ahithophel and many others of the tribe of Judah were alienated because, in the rapidly growing empire of David, their relative importance was of necessity constantly diminishing. It is noteworthy that the rebellion was cradled in Judah, and seems to have found there its chief strength.<p>There is a difference of opinion whether Psalms 41 was written on this occasion; but its ninth verse certainly applies very pointedly to Ahithophel; and his conduct, both in his treachery and his suicide, forms a striking parallel to that of Judas, to whom this verse is applied in <a href="/john/13-18.htm" title="I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eats bread with me has lifted up his heel against me.">John 13:18</a>. Many writers also consider that Psalms 55 was composed with reference to Ahithophel.<p><span class= "bld">While he offered sacrifices.</span>—Absalom had arranged these, apparently with pomp and circumstance, to continue through several days. This gave time for the conspiracy to gain strength, and the accompanying feasting allowed Absalom an excellent opportunity for using his popular arts, and with such success that “the people increased continually with Absalom.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/2_samuel/15.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/2_samuel/15-12.htm" title="And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counselor, from his city, even from Giloh, while he offered sacrifices.

It is supposed by the Jews that Ahithophel was incensed against David for his conduct to Bath-sheba, who they think, was his grand-daughter, being the daughter of Eliam, <a href="/2_samuel/11-3.htm" title="And David sent and inquired after the woman.

It doubtless must have been matter of great surprise and inexpressible affliction to David, to find the two men, whom of all others he seems to have most loved and confided in, combining against him, and compassing his death, Absalom and Ahithophel, his son and his counsellor. <span class="ital">While he offered sacrifices — </span>Or, rather, <span class="ital">after he had offered sacrifices: </span>for it seems he sent for him while he sat at dinner. <span class="ital">And the conspiracy was strong — </span>Ahithophel was too cunning to discover himself till he saw all things favourable and prosperous on the part of Absalom: and they both very well judged that his accession to the conspiracy, in those circumstances, was the likeliest means to ensure its success. <span class="ital">For the people increased continually — </span>Most of whom, it is probable, intended no harm at first, perhaps not even to divest David of his crown and dignity, much less to take away his life; but only to substitute Absalom as a coadjutor to him, for the executing of the royal authority during David’s life, and to be his successor after his death. However, it is evident they did proceed so far, at last, as to design to kill David for their own greater security. For so Ahithophel advised, and they all consented to it, <a href="/2_samuel/17-2.htm" title="And I will come on him while he is weary and weak handed, and will make him afraid: and all the people that are with him shall flee; and I will smite the king only:">2 Samuel 17:2</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/17-4.htm" title="And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel.">2 Samuel 17:4</a>; which shows how dangerous it is to go out of the right way; for we do not know down what horrid precipices we may fall afterward.

For he was far too subtle a man to have joined the conspiracy unless he bad felt reasonably sure that it would be successful. Successful it would have been had his advice been followed; but so correctly did he estimate the result if David were allowed time to gather his friends, that, when his counsel was rejected, he withdrew immediately to Giloh, and committed suicide. Still if the revolt had been successful, it would have involved, if not the death of Bathsheba, yet certainly that of her sons, and the exclusion of Ahithophel's great-grandchildren from the throne. In <a href="/psalms/41.htm">Psalm 41</a>, written at this time, we learn what were David's feelings when he heard the news of this conspiracy, and Ahithophel is the familiar friend, in whom he had trusted, and who had eaten at his table, but now raised up his heel to kick at him. In <a href="/john/13-18.htm">John 13:18</a> the words are quoted of Judas Iscariot, of whom Ahithophel was a type in his treachery and in his death by his own hand. The translation, "sent for Ahithophel," cannot be maintained. The Hebrew is "sent Ahithophel," but for what purpose or on what embassy is not mentioned. As thus something must have dropped out of the Hebrew text, it possibly may be the preposition "for," as this gives a good sense. For Giloh, Ahithophel's town, was situated a few miles to the south of Hebron (<a href="/joshua/15-51.htm">Joshua 15:51</a>), and Ahithophel had probably been working there secretly for Absalom for some time. As David's counsellor, his proper place of residence would have been Jerusalem, but the conspiracy had been kept so secret that he had been able to get away without suspicion. He is now summoned to Absalom's side, and his presence there brings in so many adherents that a rapid march on Jerusalem might have put David into their power. The Revised Version is right in translating, <span class="cmt_word">while he offered the sacrifices;</span> namely, those which he had vowed, and which were the reason given for his visit to Hebron. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Thus Absalom stole the heart of the men of Israel. &#1490;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1489; &#1500;&#1489; does not mean to deceive or cheat, like &#1500;&#1489; &#1490;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1489; in the Kal in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/31-20.htm">Genesis 31:20</a>, but to steal the heart, i.e., to bring a person over to his side secretly and by stratagem. </body></html>
