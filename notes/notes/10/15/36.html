He prayed this, in firm belief that God has all hearts in his hand, and tongues also. But we must second our prayers with endeavours, and David did so, else we tempt God. But we do not find wisdom and simplicity so united in any mere man, that we can perceive nothing which needs forgiveness. Yet, when the Son of David was treated with all possible treachery and cruelty, his wisdom, meekness, candour, and patience, were perfect. Him let us follow, cleave to, and serve, in life and in death.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Render ... "when David was come to the top of the mount where people worship God." The top here, and in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-1.htm">2 Samuel 16:1</a>, is used almost as a proper name.

When David was going by the height of the olive-trees, i.e., the Mount of Olives, weeping as he went, with his head covered, and barefooted, as a sign of grief and mourning (see <a href="/esther/6-12.htm">Esther 6:12</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/24-17.htm">Ezekiel 24:17</a>), and with the people who accompanied him also mourning, he received intelligence that Ahithophel (see at <a href="/2_samuel/15-12.htm">2 Samuel 15:12</a>) was with Absalom, and among the conspirators. &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491; &#1493;&#1491;&#1493;&#1491; gives no sense; for David cannot be the subject, because the next clause, "and David said," etc., contains most distinctly an expression of David's on receiving some information. Thenius would therefore alter &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491; into the Hophal &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1491;, whilst Ewald (131, a) would change it into &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491;, an unusual form of the Hophal, "David was informed," according to the construction of the Hiphil with the accusative. But although this construction of the Hiphil is placed beyond all doubt by <a href="/job/31-37.htm">Job 31:37</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/26-4.htm">Job 26:4</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-10.htm">Ezekiel 43:10</a>, the Hiphil is construed as a rule, as the Hophal always is, with &#1500; of the person who receives information. Consequently &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1491; must be altered into &#1500;&#1491;&#1493;&#1491;, and &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491; taken as impersonal, "they announced to David." Upon receipt of this intelligence David prayed to the Lord, that He would "turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness," make it appear as folly, i.e., frustrate it, - a prayer which God answered (vid., <a href="/2_samuel/17-1.htm">2 Samuel 17:1</a>.). </body></html>
