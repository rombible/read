It is right to be more concerned for the church's prosperity than our own; to prefer the success of the gospel above our own wealth, credit, ease, and safety. Observe with what satisfaction and submission David speaks of the Divine disposal. It is our interest, as well as our duty, cheerfully to acquiesce in the will of God, whatever befalls us. Let us see God's hand in all events; and that we may not be afraid of what shall be, let us see all events in God's hand. David's sin was ever before him, Ps 51:3; but never so plain, nor ever appearing so black as now. He never wept thus when Saul hunted him, but a wounded conscience makes troubles lie heavy, Ps 38:4.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Art not those a seer? - If the text be correct, the sense would be, "Art thou not a seer? therefore go back to the city, and observe, and certify me of what thou seest" <a href="/2_samuel/15-28.htm">2 Samuel 15:28</a>.

The brook Kidron is a winter torrent, i.e., a mountain torrent which only flows during the heavy rains of winter (&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#788;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x39a;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bd;, <a href="/john/18-1.htm">John 18:1</a>). It is on the eastern side of Jerusalem, between the city and the Mount of Olives, and derives its name from the appearance of the water when rendered muddy through the melting of the snow (cf. <a href="/job/6-16.htm">Job 6:16</a>). In summer it is nothing more than a dry channel in the valley of Jehoshaphat (see Robinson, Pal. i. 396, and v. Raumer, Pal. p. 309, note 81). "The wilderness" (midbar) is the northern part of the desert of Judah, through which the road to Jericho and the Jordan lay.</body></html>
