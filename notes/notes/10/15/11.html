That they were entirely ignorant of Absalom’s purposes shows the extreme secrecy with which the affair was managed. Absalom, no doubt, hoped when he once had them at Hebron, to secure them for his side, or, failing this, forcibly to prevent their opposition. In any case it would appear to the people that they were with him, and he would thus secure additional prestige.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/2_samuel/15.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/2_samuel/15-11.htm" title="And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, that were called; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew not any thing.">2 Samuel 15:11</a></span>. <span class="ital">With Absalom went two hundred men that were called — </span>That is, that were invited by him to feast with him on his sacrifice, and were such as he had picked out as fit for his purpose; principal persons of the city, no doubt, and of some reputation with the king and people.

The principal men of Jerusalem joined Absalom's feast upon his sacrifice. Pious persons are glad to see others appear religious, and this gives occasion for deceptions.

It was a natural center, had probably many inhabitants discontented at the transfer of the government to Jerusalem, and contained many of the friends of Absalom's youth. As the place of his birth (compare <a href="/1_samuel/20-6.htm">1 Samuel 20:6</a>), it afforded a plausible pretext for holding there the great sacrificial feast ("the serving the Lord," <a href="/2_samuel/15-8.htm">2 Samuel 15:8</a>), which Absalom pretended to have vowed to hold to the glory of God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. with Absalom went two hundred men &#8230; that were called&#8212;From their quality, reputation, and high standing, such as would create the impression that the king patronized the movement and, being aged and infirm, was willing to adopt his oldest and noblest son to divide with him the cares and honors of government.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">That were called; </span> such as Absalom had picked out as fit for his purpose; such as were of some quality and reputation with the king and people, which would give a great countenance to his undertaking, and give occasion to people at first to think that this was done by his father’s consent or connivance, as being now aged, and infirm, and willing to resign the kingdom to him, as his eldest son, and the noblest too, as being descended from a king by both parents; and such as by their wisdom and interest in the people might have done David much service in this needful time; yet such as were not very martial men, nor likely with violence to oppose his proceedings.

In all probability they were men of distinction, and would naturally be regarded, both at Jerusalem and at Hebron, as accomplices in the conspiracy. No doubt Absalom hoped that many of them, finding themselves thus compromised, and seeing the number of his supporters, would decide to join him; or failing this, they might be held as hostages.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Two hundred men.</span> These, doubtless, were courtiers and men of rank, who were so accustomed to Absalom's love of display, that, when <span class="cmt_word">called</span>, that is, invited, they would go without suspicion. To Absalom their attendance was most important, not only because, being compromised, many would join him, and even all of them for a time be forced to yield obedience, but because they would make the people of Hebron suppose that Absalom had a powerful body of supporters at Jerusalem. It is quite possible that at Hebron, and generally in Judah, there was great discontent because David had left their tribe to choose a capital elsewhere, and because he did not show them any decided preference over the other tribes, whose good will he would rightly seek to conciliate. The existence of much jealousy between Judah and the ten tribes is plain from <a href="/2_samuel/19-41.htm">2 Samuel 19:41-43</a>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>And when any one came near to him to prostrate himself before him, he took him by the hand and kissed him.
