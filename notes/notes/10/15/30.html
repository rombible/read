A king, venerable for his years and victories; sacred in the characters, both of his piety and prophecy; renowned for prowess, and revered for wisdom, reduced to the condition of a fugitive! to a sudden and extreme necessity of fleeing for his life, from the presence of his own son, his darling and delight; and a whole country loudly lamenting his fate! In this condition, David went up the mount, and when he reached the summit of it, fell down prostrate before God. Josephus tells us, that when David reached the top of the mountain, he took a view of the city, and prayed to God with abundance of tears. The reader will perhaps think it worth his notice, that Josephus should tell us, that David wept and viewed the city in the same spot from which, the evangelist informs us, our blessed Saviour wept over it.” — Delaney. And is this the glorious king of Israel, the beloved of God, the wise, the victorious David, who slew his ten thousands? Strange change indeed! What has produced this sad reverse? Sin alone has wrought all this! These are its baneful effects: he forgot the commandment of the Lord his God, and from hence has flowed all this evil! You that plead an excuse for sin, because David, the man after God’s own heart, fell into it; remember, likewise, what bitter and grievous punishments he underwent for it. Are you willing to pay such a price for sin? And yet, be assured, the inviolable laws of God require you to pay it in one way or other.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/15.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>15:24-30 David is very careful for the safety of the ark. It is right to be more concerned for the church's prosperity than our own; to prefer the success of the gospel above our own wealth, credit, ease, and safety. Observe with what satisfaction and submission David speaks of the Divine disposal. It is our interest, as well as our duty, cheerfully to acquiesce in the will of God, whatever befalls us. Let us see God's hand in all events; and that we may not be afraid of what shall be, let us see all events in God's hand. David's sin was ever before him, Ps 51:3; but never so plain, nor ever appearing so black as now. He never wept thus when Saul hunted him, but a wounded conscience makes troubles lie heavy, Ps 38:4.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>His head covered - See the marginal references and <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-3.htm">Jeremiah 14:3-4</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/24-17.htm">Ezekiel 24:17</a>; the sign of deep mourning. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>30.

So we in great sorrow bury our faces in our hands. In this mark of mourning all joined, but David added the going barefoot as a sign of deeper humiliation. According to the Jewish Midrash, it was upon the Mount of Olives that David composed the third psalm. More probably it was at the fords of the Jordan, after David, wearied with the fatigues of the march, had enjoyed a short refreshing slumber, and while he was waiting for his two young friends, that he comforted himself by this outpouring of his heart to God. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Zadok the priest and all the Levites (who were in Jerusalem) left the city with the fugitive king, bearing the ark of the covenant: "And they set down the ark of God, and Abiathar came up, till all the people had come completely over from the city." &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;, &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;, ascendit (lxx, Vulg.), may probably be accounted for from the fact that Abiathar did not come to join the fugitives till the procession halted at the Mount of Olives; so that &#1506;&#1500;&#1492;, like &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, merely refers to his actually going up, and &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500; affirms that Abiathar joined them until all the people from the city had arrived. The rendering proposed by Michaelis and Bttcher ("he offered sacrifices") is precluded by the fact that &#1506;&#1500;&#1492; never means to sacrifice when written without &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492;, or unless the context points distinctly to sacrifices, as in <a href="/2_samuel/24-22.htm">2 Samuel 24:22</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/2-28.htm">1 Samuel 2:28</a>. The ark of the covenant was put down, because those who went out with the king made a halt, to give the people who were still coming time to join the procession.</body></html>
