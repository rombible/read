But we do not find wisdom and simplicity so united in any mere man, that we can perceive nothing which needs forgiveness. Yet, when the Son of David was treated with all possible treachery and cruelty, his wisdom, meekness, candour, and patience, were perfect.

David seems to have taken the road leading directly over the hill to Bahurim (see note on ch. <a href="/2_samuel/3-16.htm" title="And her husband went with her along weeping behind her to Bahurim.

A trace of the name is perhaps preserved in <span class="ital">Ain Arîk</span>, about six miles W. S. W. of Bethel. As Hushai came <span class="ital">to meet</span> David he had probably been absent from the city—perhaps at his native place—when the rebellion broke out, and hastened back to join his master. His coming was in a manner the answer to David’s prayer in <span class="ital"><a href="/2_samuel/15-31.htm" title="And one told David, saying, Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom.

The term rendered <span class="ital">coat</span> denotes the loose shirt or tunic, over which a cloak was usually worn. See the illustrations in Smith’s <span class="ital">Dict. of the Bible</span>, I. 454, or Lane’s <span class="ital">Modern Egyptians</span>, I. 36.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Where he worshipped God;</span> more correctly, <span class="accented">where God was worshipped</span>, and so the Revised Version. The summit of the Mount of Olives was one of the many bamoth, or high places, situated on the top of hills, where, in the old Canaanitish time, men had worshipped their heathenish deities. They were still regarded as consecrated places, but the worship had now been transferred to Elohim, the true God. They continued to be hallowed spots, with Levitical priests to minister at them, until the stricter times of Josiah (<a href="/2_kings/23-8.htm">2 Kings 23:8</a>), when such worship was forbidden; but even then these priests seem to have retained considerable privileges, though their position was inferior to that held by the priests of the temple. It was at this hallowed spot that David's old friend and privy counselor (ver. 37), Hushai, met him, <span class="cmt_word">with his coat rent</span> - not the upper garment, but the <span class="accented">kuttoneth</span>, the under tunic, the rending of which was a sign of deeper sorrow. We read of "the border of the Archites" (so the Revised Version, rightly) in <a href="/joshua/16-2.htm">Joshua 16:2</a>, near Bethel, in the tribe of Manasseh; and Hushai's birthplace was probably there. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Then the king said to Zadok, "Take back the ark of God into the city! If I find favour in the eyes of Jehovah, He will bring me back and let me see Him (i.e., himself: the reference is to God) and His dwelling (i.e., the ark of the covenant as the throne of the divine glory in the tent that had been set up for it). But if He thus say, I have not delight in thee; behold, here am I, let Him do to me as seemeth good to Him." Thus David put his fate in believing confidence into the hand of the Lord, because he felt that it was the Lord who was chastising him for his sons through this rebellion.</body></html>
