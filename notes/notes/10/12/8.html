We are told of only one wife of Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/14-50.htm" title="And the name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz: and the name of the captain of his host was Abner, the son of Ner, Saul's uncle.">1Samuel 14:50</a>) and of one concubine (<a href="/2_samuel/3-7.htm" title="And Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah: and Ishbosheth said to Abner, Why have you gone in to my father's concubine?">2Samuel 3:7</a>) who was taken by Abner. If he had others, David certainly could not have taken them until more than seven and a half years after Saul’s death.

The expression in the text, however, does not necessarily signify that David married any of them; nor have we any proof that he did. Indeed, it is doubtful whether he could consistently with the law of God. See <a href="/leviticus/18-8.htm" title="The nakedness of your father's wife shall you not uncover: it is your father's nakedness.">Leviticus 18:8</a>; <a href="/leviticus/18-15.htm" title="You shall not uncover the nakedness of your daughter in law: she is your son's wife; you shall not uncover her nakedness.">Leviticus 18:15</a>.

By this parable Nathan drew from David a sentence against himself. Great need there is of prudence in giving reproofs. In his application, he was faithful. He says in plain terms, Thou art the man. God shows how much he hates sin, even in his own people; and wherever he finds it, he will not let it go unpunished. David says not a word to excuse himself or make light of his sin, but freely owns it. When David said, I have sinned, and Nathan perceived that he was a true penitent, he assured him his sin was forgiven. Thou shalt not die: that is, not die eternally, nor be for ever put away from God, as thou wouldest have been, if thou hadst not put away the sin. Though thou shalt all thy days be chastened of the Lord, yet thou shalt not be condemned with the world. There is this great evil in the sins of those who profess religion and relation to God, that they furnish the enemies of God and religion with matter for reproach and blasphemy. And it appears from David's case, that even where pardon is obtained, the Lord will visit the transgression of his people with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes. For one momentary gratification of a vile lust, David had to endure many days and years of extreme distress.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And thy master's wives ... - According to Eastern custom, the royal harem was a part of the royal inheritance.

I gave thee thy master's house, and thy master's wives&#8212;The phraseology means nothing more than that God in His providence had given David, as king of Israel, everything that was Saul's. The history furnishes conclusive evidence that he never actually married any of the wives of Saul. But the harem of the preceding king belongs, according to Oriental notions, as a part of the regalia to his successor.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Thy master’s wives, </span> or, <span class="ital">women</span>, as that word is elsewhere used; as <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/numbers/31-18.htm" title="But all the women children, that have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves.">Numbers 31:18</a></span>. And though we read not a word of God’s giving, or of David’s taking, any of Saul’s wives into his bosom; or, which is all one, into his bed; yet (which I think to be aimed at here) it might be according to the manner of that time, that the wives and concubines of the precedent king belonged to the successor, to be at least at his dispose.

Nor would this have been reckoned amongst the mercies and blessings which God here is said to give him, and which are opposed to that which he sinfully took. But we do read, that Merab, Saul’s daughter, was given to him for his wife by Saul’s promise, and consequently by God’s grant; though afterwards Saul perfidiously gave her to another man; and that Michal, the other daughter, was actually given to him, <span class="bld"> 1Sa 18</span>. And it is very possible that some other of David’s wives were nearly related to the house of Saul; whereby David might design to enlarge and strengthen his interest in the kingdom; although there is no absolute necessity of restraining this to Saul, seeing the word is plural, masters, and may belong to others also, who sometimes were owned by David as his masters, lords, or superiors, such as Nabal was, and some others not elsewhere named might be, whose houses and wives, or, at least, women, God might give to David. Such and such things; such other things as thou hadst wanted, or in reason desired. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And I gave thee thy master's house,....

As far as we know, Saul had but one wife (<a href="/1_samuel/14-50.htm">1 Samuel 14:50</a>) and one concubine, Rizpah (<a href="/2_samuel/3-7.htm">2 Samuel 3:7</a>). Of Ishbosheth's family arrangements we know little, but his harem, if he had one, would become the property of David. But independently of this, the permission of polygamy had made it possible for him to take any of the daughters of Israel and Judah to wife, and he had freely availed himself of this licence. Yet, not content, he had lusted after a married woman, and had got rid of her husband by murder, meanly using the sword of the Ammonites to accomplish his own criminal purpose. The word used in this clause, and rendered "thou hast slain him," is a very strong one, and literally means "thou hast murdered him," though the sword was that of the enemy. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Nathan's Reproof. - <a href="/2_samuel/12-1.htm">2 Samuel 12:1</a>. To ensure the success of his mission, viz., to charge the king with his crimes, Nathan resorted to a parable by which he led on the king to pronounce sentence of death upon himself. The parable is a very simple one, and drawn from life. Two men were living in a certain city: the one was rich, and had many sheep and oxen; the other was poor, and possessed nothing at all but one small lamb which he had bought and nourished (&#1497;&#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, lit. kept alive), so that it grew up in his house along with his son, and was treated most tenderly and loved like a daughter. The custom of keeping pet-sheep in the house, as we keep lap-dogs, is still met with among the Arabs (vid., Bochart, Hieroz. i. p. 594). There came a traveller (&#1492;&#1500;&#1498;, a journey, for a traveller) to the rich man (&#1500;&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; without an article, the express definition being introduced afterwards in connection with the adjective &#1492;&#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1512;; vid., Ewald, 293a, p. 741), and he grudged to take of his own sheep and oxen to prepare (sc., a meal) for the traveller who had come to his house; "and he took the poor man's lamb, and dressed it for the man that had come to him." </body></html>
