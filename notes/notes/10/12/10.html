By this parable Nathan drew from David a sentence against himself. Great need there is of prudence in giving reproofs. In his application, he was faithful. He says in plain terms, Thou art the man. God shows how much he hates sin, even in his own people; and wherever he finds it, he will not let it go unpunished. David says not a word to excuse himself or make light of his sin, but freely owns it. When David said, I have sinned, and Nathan perceived that he was a true penitent, he assured him his sin was forgiven. Thou shalt not die: that is, not die eternally, nor be for ever put away from God, as thou wouldest have been, if thou hadst not put away the sin. Though thou shalt all thy days be chastened of the Lord, yet thou shalt not be condemned with the world. There is this great evil in the sins of those who profess religion and relation to God, that they furnish the enemies of God and religion with matter for reproach and blasphemy. And it appears from David's case, that even where pardon is obtained, the Lord will visit the transgression of his people with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes. For one momentary gratification of a vile lust, David had to endure many days and years of extreme distress.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And thy master's wives ... - According to Eastern custom, the royal harem was a part of the royal inheritance.

Here it may be understood as equivalent to “all the days of thy life.” Cp. <a href="/1_samuel/1-22.htm" title="But Hannah went not up; for she said to her husband, I will not go up until the child be weaned, and then I will bring him, that he may appear before the LORD, and there abide for ever.">1 Samuel 1:22</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/27-12.htm" title="And Achish believed David, saying, He has made his people Israel utterly to abhor him; therefore he shall be my servant for ever.">1 Samuel 27:12</a>. The prophecy was fulfilled by Amnon’s murder (ch. <a href="/2_samuel/13-28.htm" title="Now Absalom had commanded his servants, saying, Mark you now when Amnon's heart is merry with wine, and when I say to you, Smite Amnon; then kill him, fear not: have not I commanded you? be courageous, and be valiant.">2 Samuel 13:28</a>); Absalom’s death as a rebel (ch. <a href="/2_samuel/18-14.htm" title="Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with you. And he took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he was yet alive in the middle of the oak.">2 Samuel 18:14</a>); and Adonijah’s execution as a traitor (<a href="/1_kings/2-25.htm" title="And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell on him that he died.">1 Kings 2:25</a>). In all these deeds may be traced the bitter fruit of David’s sin. Amnon no doubt excused his lust by alleging his father’s example: Absalom’s rebellion was indirectly the consequence of Amnon’s act: Adonijah died for presuming to appear as the rival of Bath-sheba’s son.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The sword shall never depart from thine house;</span> that is, thy crime shall not be expiated by one slaughter, but by many, so that thy punishment shall cease only at thine own death. This sentence was fulfilled in Amnon's murder (<a href="/2_samuel/13-28.htm">2 Samuel 13:28</a>), who had been encouraged in his crime by his father's example. Upon this followed Absalom's rebellion and death (<a href="/2_samuel/18-14.htm">2 Samuel 18:14</a>); and finally, when in his last hours David made Solomon his successor, he knew that he was virtually passing sentence on Adonijah, the eldest of his surviving sons. But what a fearful choice! for had he not done so, then Bathsheba and her four sons would doubtless have been slain, whereas there was some hope that Solomon might spare his brother. That Adonijah was unworthy we gather from the fact that he had ceased to be cohen, and that this office was conferred, after Absalom's rebellion, on Ira the Jairite (<a href="/2_samuel/20-26.htm">2 Samuel 20:26</a>), Solomon being then too young to hold such a position. Until he committed this crime, David's family had probably dwelt in concord, and it was his own wickedness which broke up their unity, and introduced among them strife, mutual hatred, and the shedding of blood. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Nathan's Reproof. - <a href="/2_samuel/12-1.htm">2 Samuel 12:1</a>. To ensure the success of his mission, viz., to charge the king with his crimes, Nathan resorted to a parable by which he led on the king to pronounce sentence of death upon himself. The parable is a very simple one, and drawn from life. Two men were living in a certain city: the one was rich, and had many sheep and oxen; the other was poor, and possessed nothing at all but one small lamb which he had bought and nourished (&#1497;&#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, lit. kept alive), so that it grew up in his house along with his son, and was treated most tenderly and loved like a daughter. The custom of keeping pet-sheep in the house, as we keep lap-dogs, is still met with among the Arabs (vid., Bochart, Hieroz. i. p. 594). There came a traveller (&#1492;&#1500;&#1498;, a journey, for a traveller) to the rich man (&#1500;&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; without an article, the express definition being introduced afterwards in connection with the adjective &#1492;&#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1512;; vid., Ewald, 293a, p. 741), and he grudged to take of his own sheep and oxen to prepare (sc., a meal) for the traveller who had come to his house; "and he took the poor man's lamb, and dressed it for the man that had come to him." </body></html>
