By this parable Nathan drew from David a sentence against himself. Great need there is of prudence in giving reproofs. In his application, he was faithful. He says in plain terms, Thou art the man. God shows how much he hates sin, even in his own people; and wherever he finds it, he will not let it go unpunished. David says not a word to excuse himself or make light of his sin, but freely owns it. When David said, I have sinned, and Nathan perceived that he was a true penitent, he assured him his sin was forgiven. Thou shalt not die: that is, not die eternally, nor be for ever put away from God, as thou wouldest have been, if thou hadst not put away the sin. Though thou shalt all thy days be chastened of the Lord, yet thou shalt not be condemned with the world. There is this great evil in the sins of those who profess religion and relation to God, that they furnish the enemies of God and religion with matter for reproach and blasphemy. And it appears from David's case, that even where pardon is obtained, the Lord will visit the transgression of his people with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes. For one momentary gratification of a vile lust, David had to endure many days and years of extreme distress.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Nathan came to David as if to ask his judicial decision on the case about to be submitted to him (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-2.htm">2 Samuel 14:2-11</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/20-35.htm">1 Kings 20:35-41</a>).

Nathan's Parable.<p>1. the Lord sent Nathan unto David&#8212;The use of parables is a favorite style of speaking among Oriental people, especially in the conveyance of unwelcome truth. This exquisitely pathetic parable was founded on a common custom of pastoral people who have pet lambs, which they bring up with their children, and which they address in terms of endearment. The atrocity of the real, however, far exceeded that of the fictitious offense.Nathan by a parable reproveth and threateneth David, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/context/2_samuel/12-1.htm" title="And the LORD sent Nathan to David.

He manageth his relation as if it had been a real thing; and demands the king’s justice in the case. Though the application of this parable to David be easy and obvious, yet it matters not if some circumstances be not so applicable; because it was fit to put in some such clauses, either for the decency of the parable, or that David might not too early discover his designs. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the Lord sent Nathan unto David,.... Quickly after the child was born begotten on Bathsheba, and when it was known and became the public talk of people, and the enemies of religion were full of it, and blasphemed on account of it, <a href="/2_samuel/12-14.htm">2 Samuel 12:14</a>; so that David was nine months or more without any true sense of his sin, his heart hardened, his graces dormant, the joys of salvation taken from him, and he without any communion with God, and having little concern about it; though perhaps he might have some pangs at times, which quickly went off; though some think he exercised repentance in a private way before; acknowledged his sin to the Lord, and had a sense of pardon, and before this time penned the thirty second and the hundred thirtieth psalms on this occasion, <a href="/psalms/32-1.htm">Psalm 32:1</a>; but Nathan is sent to awaken and arouse him, to express a sense of his sin, and repentance for it in public, which he did by penning and publishing the fifty first psalm after Nathan had been with him, <a href="/psalms/51-1.htm">Psalm 51:1</a>; for though the Lord may leave his people to fall into sin, and suffer them to continue therein some time, yet not always; they shall rise again through the assistance of his Spirit and grace, in the acts of repentance and faith, both in private and public: <p>and he came unto him, and said unto him: he came as if he had a case to lay before him, and to have justice done, and he told the story as if it was a real fact, and so David understood it: <p>there were two men in one city: pointing at David and Uriah, who both lived in Jerusalem: <p>the one rich and the other poor; David the rich man, king over all Israel; Uriah a subject, an officer in his army, comparatively poor. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_samuel/12.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the LORD sent <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> Nathan unto David.
