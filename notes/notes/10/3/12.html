He proposes a league, that he may have a definite assurance of consideration for himself, and he makes this the price of exerting his influence on David’s behalf. The repetition of the word “saying” has occasioned some difficulty to the commentators, but this disappears when it is remembered that the two clauses are separate parts of Abner’s message. His messengers were charged first to represent the importance of Abner’s influence, and then afterwards to say that he would exert it for David for a satisfactory consideration.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/2_samuel/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/2_samuel/3-12.htm" title="And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose is the land? saying also, Make your league with me, and, behold, my hand shall be with you, to bring about all Israel to you.">2 Samuel 3:12</a></span>. <span class="ital">And Abner sent messengers to David </span>— Having thus incensed his master, he judged it not safe to delay the execution of what he had threatened. Yet he thought it neither safe nor prudent to go himself to David till he had tried his inclinations by messengers, whom he sent privately to treat with him about a reconciliation.

While men go on in sin, and apparently without concern, they are often conscious that they are fighting against God. Many mean to serve their own purposes; and will betray those who trust them, when they can get any advantage. Yet the Lord serves his own designs, even by those who are thus actuated by revenge, ambition, or lust; but as they intend not to honour him, in the end they will be thrown aside with contempt. There was real generosity both to Michal and to the memory of Saul, in David's receiving the former, remembering probably how once he owed his life to her affection, and knowing that she was separated from him partly by her father's authority. Let no man set his heart on that which he is not entitled to. If any disagreement has separated husband and wife, as they expect the blessing of God, let them be reconciled, and live together in love.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Whose is the land? - Meaning, Is not the land thine by God's promise? <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12, 13. Abner sent messengers to David&#8212;Though his language implied a secret conviction, that in supporting Ish-bosheth he had been laboring to frustrate the divine purpose of conferring the sovereignty of the kingdom on David, this acknowledgment was no justification either of the measure he was now adopting, or of the motives that prompted it. Nor does it seem possible to uphold the full integrity and honor of David's conduct in entertaining his secret overtures for undermining Ish-bosheth, except we take into account the divine promise of the kingdom, and his belief that the secession of Abner was a means designed by Providence for accomplishing it. The demand for the restoration of his wife Michal was perfectly fair; but David's insisting on it at that particular moment, as an indispensable condition of his entering into any treaty with Abner, seems to have proceeded not so much from a lingering attachment as from an expectation that his possession of her would incline some adherents of the house of Saul to be favorable to his cause.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Messengers on his behalf; </span> who in his name and stead might treat with David concerning his reconciliation with him.

On his own account, and not on the account of Ishbosheth, or the people of Israel; but to obtain terms for himself, or in his own name, as representing him and standing in his stead; or secretly, as Kimchi explains it, unknown to Ishbosheth, or the people of Israel. The Targum is,"out of his place;''he sent them from the place where he was, from Mahanaim: <p>saying, whose is the land? the land of Israel, is it not thine, David? verily it is; to whom does it belong but unto thee, to whom the Lord has given it? not to any of Saul's posterity: this he ordered the messengers to say in the first place, in order to ingratiate himself to David, and gain his messengers an audience. The Targum is,"I swear by him that made the earth;''so Jarchi says, it is an oath by him whose the earth is, even by the living God, whose is the earth, and the fulness thereof: <p>saying also, make thy league with me; he desired to enter into a covenant of friendship with him, that everything that had passed might be forgiven and forgotten: <p>and, behold, my hand shall be with thee, to bring about all Israel unto thee: he promises on his part to do his utmost to bring all Israel under his government and to obedience to him. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_samuel/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose is the land? saying also, Make thy league with me, and, behold, my hand shall be with thee, to bring about all Israel unto thee.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/2_samuel/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>12–21.

There is however some doubt about the text, which was corrupt in the copy from which the Sept. version was made, and possibly the words <span class="ital">Whose is the land? saying also</span> should be struck out. The Targum has a curious paraphrase, “I swear by Him Who made the earth.”<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">under him.</span> The Revised Version renders this "where he was;" but the phrase really means "immediately" (see note on ch. 2:23). And this agrees with the haughty temper of Abner. Without waiting for advice, or allowing his anger to cool, he at once sent trusty envoys to open negotiations with David. <span class="cmt_word">Whose is the land?</span> Abner's meaning in these words is plain. You, David, he seems to say, will answer that the land is mine; for Jehovah has promised it to me. But, as a matter of fact, much of the land is mine (Abner's), or at least belongs to the house of Saul, whose prime minister I am. Yours is an abstract right; mine is actual possession. Come, let us make the two agree. Give me fitting assurances of safety and reward, and I will make your claim a reality. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Decline of the House of Saul. - <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-6.htm">2 Samuel 3:6-11</a>. Abner's quarrel with Ishbosheth. -  During the war between the house of Saul and the house of David, Abner adhered firmly to the house of Saul, but he appropriated one of Saul's concubines to himself. When Ishbosheth charged him with this, he fell into so violent a rage, that he at once announced to Ishbosheth his intention to hand over the kingdom to David. Abner had certainly perceived the utter incapacity of Ishbosheth for a very long time, if not from the very outset, and had probably made him king after the death of Saul, merely that he might save himself from the necessity of submitting to David, and might be able to rule in Ishbosheth's name, and possibly succeed in paving his own way to the throne. His appropriation of the concubine of the deceased monarch was at any rate a proof, according to Israelitish notions, and in fact those generally prevalent in the East, that he was aiming at the throne (vid., <a href="/2_samuel/16-21.htm">2 Samuel 16:21</a>; <a href="/1_kings/2-21.htm">1 Kings 2:21</a>). But it may gradually have become obvious to him, that the house of Saul could not possibly retain the government in opposition to David; and this may have led to his determination to persuade all the Israelites to acknowledge David, and thereby to secure for himself an influential post under his government. This will explain in a very simple manner Abner's falling away from Ishbosheth and going over to David.<p><a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-6.htm">2 Samuel 3:6-7</a><p><a href="/2_samuel/3-6.htm">2 Samuel 3:6</a> and <a href="/2_samuel/3-7.htm">2 Samuel 3:7</a> constitute one period, expanded by the introduction of circumstantial clauses, the &#1493;&#1497;&#1492;&#1497; (it came to pass) of the protasis being continued in the &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; (he said) of <a href="/2_samuel/3-7.htm">2 Samuel 3:7</a>. "It came to pass, when there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, and Abner showed himself strong for the house of Saul, and Saul had a concubine named Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah, that he (Ishbosheth) said to Abner, Why hast thou gone to my father's concubine?" The subject to "said" is omitted in the apodosis; but it is evident from <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-8.htm">2 Samuel 3:8</a>, and the expression "my father," that Ishbosheth is to be supplied. Even in the second circumstantial clause, "and Saul had a concubine," the reason why this is mentioned is only to be gathered from Ishbosheth's words. &#1489;&#1468; &#1492;&#1514;&#1495;&#1494;&#1511;: to prove one's self strong for, or with, a person, i.e., to render him powerful help. &#1488;&#1500; &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1488; means "to cohabit with." It was the exclusive right of the successor to the throne to cohabit with the concubines of the deceased king, who came down to him as part of the property which he inherited.</body></html>
