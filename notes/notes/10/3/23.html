David laid Abner's murder deeply to heart, and in many ways expressed his detestation of it. The guilt of blood brings a curse upon families: if men do not avenge it, God will. It is a sad thing to die like a fool, as they do that any way shorten their own days, and those who make no provision for another world. Who would be fond of power, when a man may have the name of it, and must be accountable for it, yet is hampered in the use of it? David ought to have done his duty, and then trusted God with the issue. Carnal policy spared Joab. The Son of David may long delay, but never fails to punish impenitent sinners. He who now reigns upon the throne of David, has a kingdom of a nobler kind. Whatever He doeth, is noticed by all his willing people, and is pleasing to them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Abner repeats the offer <a href="/2_samuel/3-12.htm">2 Samuel 3:12</a>; and the condition of Michal's return <a href="/2_samuel/3-13.htm">2 Samuel 3:13</a> being now fulfilled, David accepts it, and the league between them was solemnly ratified at David's board, amidst the rites of hospitality. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2Sa 3:22-30.
