And surely a more humane and benevolent usage never obtained in any country.

David laid Abner's murder deeply to heart, and in many ways expressed his detestation of it. The guilt of blood brings a curse upon families: if men do not avenge it, God will. It is a sad thing to die like a fool, as they do that any way shorten their own days, and those who make no provision for another world. Who would be fond of power, when a man may have the name of it, and must be accountable for it, yet is hampered in the use of it? David ought to have done his duty, and then trusted God with the issue. Carnal policy spared Joab. The Son of David may long delay, but never fails to punish impenitent sinners. He who now reigns upon the throne of David, has a kingdom of a nobler kind. Whatever He doeth, is noticed by all his willing people, and is pleasing to them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>To eat meat ... - Fasting was a sign of the deepest mourning <a href="/2_samuel/1-12.htm">2 Samuel 1:12</a>.

As Abner had stabbed Asahel in open war [2Sa 2:23], Joab had not the right of the Goel. Besides, he had adopted a lawless and execrable method of obtaining satisfaction (see on [258]1Ki 2:5). The deed was an insult to the authority, as well as most damaging to the prospects of the king. But David's feelings and conduct on hearing of the death, together with the whole character and accompaniments of the funeral solemnity, tended not only to remove all suspicion of guilt from him, but even to turn the tide of popular opinion in his favor, and to pave the way for his reigning over all the tribes more honorably than by the treacherous negotiations of Abner.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">To eat meat; </span> to refresh and cheer up his depressed spirits, as they used to do at funerals.

To shew his grief and his respect for Abner David refused to eat until sunset, the regular time for terminating a fast.

Jud.,' 2:01). To this day, at a Jewish funeral in Germany, the bearers are regaled with eggs, broad, and wine. While, then, others were partaking of the food that had been provided, David remained apart, and when urged by the assembled multitude to join them in their meal, he protested that he would continue fasting until sunset. He thus proved that his sorrow was genuine, and the people were convinced of his innocence, and pleased at the honour which he thus did to the fallen soldier. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When David heard this, he said, "I and my kingdom are innocent before Jehovah for ever of the blood of Abner.

Never shall there be wanting (&#1497;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514; &#1488;&#1500;, let there not be cut off, so that there shall not be, as in <a href="/joshua/9-23.htm">Joshua 9:23</a>) in the house of Joab one that hath an issue (vid., <a href="/leviticus/15-2.htm">Leviticus 15:2</a>), and a leper, and one who leans upon a stick (i.e., a lame person or cripple; &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1498;, according to the lxx &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;, a thick round staff), and who falls by the sword, and who is in want of bread," The meaning is: May God avenge the murder of Abner upon Joab and his family, by punishing them continually with terrible diseases, violent death, and poverty. To make the reason for this fearful curse perfectly clear, the historian observes in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-30.htm">2 Samuel 3:30</a>, that Joab and his brother Abishai had murdered Abner, "because he had slain their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle" (<a href="/2_samuel/2-23.htm">2 Samuel 2:23</a>). This act of Joab, in which Abishai must have been in some way concerned, was a treacherous act of assassination, which could not even be defended as blood-revenge, since Abner had slain Asahel in battle after repeated warnings, and only for the purpose of saving his own life. The principal motive for Joab's act was the most contemptible jealousy, or the fear lest Abner's reconciliation to David should diminish his own influence with the king, as was the case again at a later period with the murder of Amasa (<a href="/2_samuel/20-10.htm">2 Samuel 20:10</a>).</body></html>
