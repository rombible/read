David laid Abner's murder deeply to heart, and in many ways expressed his detestation of it. The guilt of blood brings a curse upon families: if men do not avenge it, God will. It is a sad thing to die like a fool, as they do that any way shorten their own days, and those who make no provision for another world. Who would be fond of power, when a man may have the name of it, and must be accountable for it, yet is hampered in the use of it? David ought to have done his duty, and then trusted God with the issue. Carnal policy spared Joab. The Son of David may long delay, but never fails to punish impenitent sinners. He who now reigns upon the throne of David, has a kingdom of a nobler kind. Whatever He doeth, is noticed by all his willing people, and is pleasing to them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Abner repeats the offer <a href="/2_samuel/3-12.htm">2 Samuel 3:12</a>; and the condition of Michal's return <a href="/2_samuel/3-13.htm">2 Samuel 3:13</a> being now fulfilled, David accepts it, and the league between them was solemnly ratified at David's board, amidst the rites of hospitality. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2Sa 3:22-30.

The Revised Version is right in rendering "came from a foray," <span class="accented">the troop</span> being a company of men sent out on a predatory excursion. It is not unlikely that David had arranged this expedition in order that his interview with Abner might take place in Joab's absence; and as he returned with "great spoil," he had probably been away for some nine or ten days, during which he had penetrated far into the country of the Amalekites. Had David acted frankly and honourably, Joab would not have stood in the way of his master's exaltation, and the blood feud between him and Abner might have been arranged. But it is evident that David secretly disliked and chafed under the control of his strong-willed and too-able nephew. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When he went with his wife, weeping behind her, to Bahurim, Abner commanded him to turn back; "and he returned."

Paltiel had therefore followed his wife to the border of the tribe of Judah, or of the kingdom of David.</body></html>
