David laid Abner's murder deeply to heart, and in many ways expressed his detestation of it. The guilt of blood brings a curse upon families: if men do not avenge it, God will. It is a sad thing to die like a fool, as they do that any way shorten their own days, and those who make no provision for another world. Who would be fond of power, when a man may have the name of it, and must be accountable for it, yet is hampered in the use of it? David ought to have done his duty, and then trusted God with the issue. Carnal policy spared Joab. The Son of David may long delay, but never fails to punish impenitent sinners. He who now reigns upon the throne of David, has a kingdom of a nobler kind. Whatever He doeth, is noticed by all his willing people, and is pleasing to them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Joab saw that if Abner was reconciled to David, his own post as second in the state would be forfeited; and then with characteristic unscrupulosity he proceeded to take Abner's life. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24-27. Joab came to the king, and said, What hast thou done?&#8212;Joab's knowledge of Abner's wily character might have led him to doubt the sincerity of that person's proposals and to disapprove the policy of relying on his fidelity. But undoubtedly there were other reasons of a private and personal nature which made Joab displeased and alarmed by the reception given to Abner. The military talents of that general, his popularity with the army, his influence throughout the nation, rendered him a formidable rival. In the event of his overtures being carried out, the important service of bringing over all the other tribes to the king of Judah would establish so strong a claim on the gratitude of David, that his accession would inevitably raise a serious obstacle to the ambition of Joab. To these considerations was added the remembrance of the blood feud that existed between them since the death of his brother Asahel (2Sa 2:23). Determined, therefore, to get Abner out of the way, Joab feigned some reason, probably in the king's name, for recalling him, and, going out to meet him, stabbed him unawares; not within Hebron, for it was a city of refuge, but at a noted well in the neighborhood.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> To search out thy counsels and secret designs, and to make use of them against thee. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner,.... Thou canst not be ignorant what a cunning deceitful man he is, nor of his designs; or dost thou not know? art thou ignorant? so read the Septuagint, Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and Arabic versions, with an interrogation: <p>that he came to deceive thee: with false hopes, or to lead into wrong measures with an intention to involve and ruin him: <p>and to know thy going out, and coming in; the affairs of his court, the secrets of his government, to observe his conduct and behaviour, and all his actions, and improve them against him: <p>and to know all that thou doest; he suggests that he came not as a friend, but as a spy, and therefore ought to have been taken up, and detained, and not dismissed. This Joab said to set David against him, fearing, if he should be received into favour, he would be a rival of his; and besides his breast was full of revenge against him for the death of his brother. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_samuel/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive thee, and to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know all that thou doest.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/2_samuel/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">25</span>. <span class="ital">thy going out and thy coming in</span>] All thy movements and undertakings.

He spoke to the Benjaminites more especially, because the existing royal family belonged to that tribe, and they had reaped many advantages in consequence (vid., <a href="/1_samuel/22-7.htm">1 Samuel 22:7</a>). The verb &#1492;&#1497;&#1492; in the circumstantial clause (<a href="/2_samuel/3-17.htm">2 Samuel 3:17</a>), and the verb &#1493;&#1497;&#1491;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-19.htm">2 Samuel 3:19</a>, which serves as a continuation of the circumstantial clause, must be translated as pluperfects, since Abner's interview with the elders of Israel and with Benjamin preceded his interview with David at Hebron. We may see from Abner's address to the elders, that even among the northern tribes the popular voice had long since decided for David. In <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12.htm">1 Chronicles 12</a> we have historical proofs of this. The word of Jehovah concerning David, which is mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-18.htm">2 Samuel 3:18</a>, is not met with anywhere in this precise form in the history of David as it has come down to us. Abner therefore had either some expression used by one of the prophets (Samuel or Gad) in his mind, which he described as the word of Jehovah, or else he regarded the anointing of David by Samuel in accordance with the command of the Lord, and the marvellous success of all that David attempted against the enemies of Israel, as a practical declaration on the part of God, that David, as the appointed successor of Saul, would perform what the Lord had spoken to Samuel concerning Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/9-16.htm">1 Samuel 9:16</a>), but what Saul had not fulfilled on account of his rebellion against the commandments of the Lord.<p><a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-19.htm">2 Samuel 3:19-20</a><p>When Abner had gained over the elders of Israel and Benjamin to recognise David as king, he went to Hebron to speak in the ears of David "all that had pleased Israel and the whole house of Benjamin," i.e., to make known to him their determination to acknowledge him as king. There went with him twenty men as representatives of all Israel, to confirm Abner's statements by their presence; and David prepared a meal for them all.</body></html>
