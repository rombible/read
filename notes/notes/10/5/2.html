How fine a document is this to princes, that they are not, in the intention of Providence, the tyrants, but the guardians of their people! that their business is the preservation and well-being of the flock, from the duty they owe to the great Lord and owner thereof!

The consummation to which events in God's Providence had been leading had now come. Saul and Jonathan, Abner and Ish-bosheth, were dead; David was already head of a very large portion of Israel; the Philistines, and perhaps the remnant of the Canaanites, were restless and threatening; and it was obviously the interest of the Israelite nation to unite themselves under the sovereignty of the valiant and virtuous son of Jesse, their former deliverer, and the man designated by the word of God as their Captain and Shepherd.

[See on [259]1Ch 11:1.] David possessed the first and indispensable qualification for the throne; namely, that of being an Israelite (De 17:15). Of his military talent he had furnished ample proof. And the people's desire for his assumption of the government of Israel was further increased by their knowledge of the will and purpose of God, as declared by Samuel (1Sa 16:11-13).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Thou wast our chief commander in our expeditions against the Philistines, and therefore art most fit to be king over us. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The Lord said to thee, </span> to wit, by Samuel, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/context/1_samuel/16-11.htm" title="And Samuel said to Jesse, Are here all your children?

It is used by Greek poets, e.g. Homer, whose regular title for Agamemnon is <span class="greekheb">ποιμὴν λαῶν</span>, “shepherd of the peoples.” But it was especially appropriate in the case of David, who was taken from the sheepfolds of Bethlehem to be the shepherd of Israel (<a href="/context/psalms/78-70.htm" title="He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:...">Psalm 78:70-72</a>), as the fishers of the Galilean lake were called to become “fishers of men” (<a href="/matthew/4-19.htm" title="And he said to them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.">Matthew 4:19</a>), and (except perhaps in <a href="/genesis/49-24.htm" title="But his bow stayed in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob; (from there is the shepherd, the stone of Israel:)">Genesis 49:24</a>) it does not appear to be used in the O.

Captain; Hebrew, <span class="accented">nagid</span>, prince; so the Revised Version (and see note on 1 Samuel 9:16). The word refers not to military matters, but to the civil administration. David had proved himself a competent leader in war when Saul was king. What Jehovah now gives is the government of Israel in time of peace. The Authorized Version renders "captain" from not perceiving that the Divine promise ensured to David far more than a military chieftainship. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Punishment of the murderers by David. - <a href="/2_samuel/4-7.htm">2 Samuel 4:7</a>. As the thread of the narrative was broken by the explanatory remarks in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/4-6.htm">2 Samuel 4:6</a>, it is resumed here by the repetition of the words &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1489;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;: "They came into the house, as he lay upon his bed in his bed-chamber, and smote him, and slew him," for the purpose of attaching the account of the further progress of the affair, viz., that they cut off his head, took it and went by the way of the Arabah (the valley of the Jordan: see <a href="/2_samuel/2-29.htm">2 Samuel 2:29</a>) the whole night, and brought the head of Ishbosheth unto David to Hebron with these words: "Behold ( equals  there thou hast) the head of Ishbosheth, the son of Saul thine enemy, who sought thy life; and thus hath Jehovah avenged my lord the king this day upon Saul and his seed." No motive is assigned for this action. But there can be little doubt that it was no other than the hope of obtaining a great reward from David. Thus they presumed "to spread the name of God and His providence as a cloak and covering over their villany, as the wicked are accustomed to do" (Berleb. Bible). </body></html>
