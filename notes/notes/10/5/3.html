The Jews think it was an act of oblivion and indemnity for all injuries done on either side, whether of Judah against the other tribes, or of all the other tribes against Judah. But in that case the league would rather have been between the tribes than with the king. It is therefore probable that it included a great deal more, and that David obliged himself to rule them according to God’s laws, and that the people promised obedience to him agreeably to the same; and that both the king and the people ratified their engagements by solemn sacrifices, and appeals to God for the sincere performance of them. All this, being done as in the presence of Him who fills heaven and earth, and to whose all-seeing eye the hearts and ways of mankind are without a covering, is properly said to have been <span class="ital">before the Lord, </span>although it was not before the ark, that symbol of the divine presence, for that certainly was not now at Hebron. <span class="ital">They anointed David king over Israel — </span>That is, they desired the high- priest to anoint him, whose office it was; and thereby expressed their consent that he should reign over them.

His advances were gradual, that his faith might be tried, and that he might gain experience. Thus his kingdom typified that of the Messiah, which was to come to its height by degrees. Thus Jesus became our Brother, took upon him our nature, dwelt in it that he might become our Prince and Saviour: thus the humbled sinner takes encouragement from the endearing relation, applies for his salvation, submits to his authority, and craves his protection.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Before the Lord - Abiathar and Zadok the priests were both with David, and the tabernacle and altar may have been at Hebron, though the ark was at Kirjath-jearim.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3.

This ‘league’ was probably a solemn contract in which the king on the one hand engaged to rule according to the laws, and the people on the other hand promised him their allegiance. Some kind of a charter, defining the king’s rights, was in existence (<a href="/1_samuel/10-25.htm" title="Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book, and laid it up before the LORD.

In Chronicles is added “according to the word of the Lord by Samuel.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The book of Chronicles contains further interesting details about this assembly at Hebron (<a href="/context/1_chronicles/12-23.htm" title="And these are the numbers of the bands that were ready armed to the war, and came to David to Hebron, to turn the kingdom of Saul to him, according to the word of the LORD....">1 Chronicles 12:23-40</a>). The numbers of fighting men sent by each tribe are preserved, amounting to a total of nearly 350,000. Stress is laid on the unanimity of feeling, and the general rejoicing with which David’s anointing was celebrated in a three days’ festival.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A league.</span> The early kings of Israel were not invested with despotic power. Thus, on Saul's appointment, "Samuel wrote in a book the manner of the kingdom" (<a href="/1_samuel/10-25.htm">1 Samuel 10:25</a>, made most emphatic in the Revised Version by the note in the margin, that the Hebrew is "the book"). The revolt against Rehoboam was the result of the too great extension of the royal power in the days of Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/12-4.htm">1 Kings 12:4</a>). Though subsequently the kings seemed to have retained their supremacy, yet when the good and patriotic Jehoiada restored the family of David to the throne, he reverted to the old ways, and "made a covenant between the king and the people" (<a href="/2_kings/11-17.htm">2 Kings 11:17</a>). Besides personal rights, the tribes, accustomed to their own leaders, and unused to yield obedience to a central authority, would certainly stipulate for a large measure of tribal independence, and the management of local matters by themselves. <span class="cmt_word">They anointed David king.</span> This was the public ratification of Samuel's anointing, and by it David became <span class="accented">de facto</span>, as well as <span class="accented">de jure</span>, king. The prophets could  not give any right over the people without the consent of the people themselves. But all religious men would see in the Divine command an obligation upon their conscience to accept as their king the man whom the prophet had anointed; and Saul acted in an irreligious manner in seeking to frustrate God's will. And this impiety culminated in his murder of the priests at Nob, which was the open avowal that he would trample all scruples of conscience underfoot. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>But David rewarded them very differently from what they had expected. He replied, "As Jehovah liveth, who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity, the man who told me, Behold, Saul is dead, and thought he was a messenger of good to me, I seized and slew at Ziklag (vid., <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-14.htm">2 Samuel 1:14-15</a>), to give him a reward for his news: how much more when wicked men have murdered a righteous man in his house upon his bed, should I not require his blood at your hand, and destroy you from the earth?" The several parts of this reply are not closely linked together so as to form one period, but answer to the excited manner in which they were spoken. There is first of all the oath, "As truly as Jehovah liveth," and the clause appended, "who redeemed my soul," in which the thought is implied that David did not feel it necessary to get rid of his enemies by the commission of crimes. After this (<a href="/2_samuel/4-10.htm">2 Samuel 4:10</a>) we have an allusion to his treatment of the messenger who announced Saul's death to him, and pretended to have slain him in order that he might obtain a good reward for his tidings. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, like &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;, simply introduces the address. &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493; ... &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491; is placed at the head absolutely, and made subordinate to the verb by &#1489;&#1493; after &#1493;&#1488;&#1495;&#1494;&#1492;. &#1500;&#1514;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1470;&#1500;&#1493;, "namely, to give him." &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; is employed to introduce the explanation, like our "namely" (vid., Ewald, 338, b.). &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1492;, good news, here "the reward of news." The main point follows in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/4-11.htm">2 Samuel 4:11</a>, beginning with &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1488;&#1507;, "how much more" (vid., Ewald, 354, c.), and is introduced in the form of a climax. The words &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493; ... &#1488;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; are also written absolutely, and placed at the head: "men have slain," for "how much more in this instance, when wicked men have slain." "Righteous" (zaddik), i.e., not guilty of any wicked deed or crime. The assumption of the regal power, which Abner had forced upon Ishbosheth, was not a capital crime in the existing state of things, and after the death of Saul; and even if it had been, the sons of Rimmon had no right to assassinate him. David's sentence then follows: "And now that this is the fact, that ye have murdered a righteous man, should I not," etc. &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;, to destroy by capital punishment, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/13-6.htm">Deuteronomy 13:6</a>, etc. &#1491;&#1468;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; ( equals &#1491;&#1468;&#1501; &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;, <a href="/genesis/9-5.htm">Genesis 9:5</a>), to require the blood of a person, i.e., to take blood-revenge. </body></html>
