It is prophesied of the gospel church, The sons of strangers shall build up thy walls, and their kings shall minister unto thee, Isa 60:10. David's government was rooted and built up. David was established king; so is the Son of David, and all who, through him, are made to our God kings and priests. Never had the nation of Israel appeared so great as it began now to be. Many have the favour and love of God, yet do not perceive it, and so want the comfort of it; but to be exalted to that, and to perceive it, is happiness.

He also states that Solomon began the Temple in the twelfth year of Hiram’s reign. This Hiram therefore reigned only eight years contemporaneously with David, as the Temple was begun in the fourth year of Solomon’s reign.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But David’s palace must have been built before the last eight years of his reign. From ch. <a href="/2_samuel/7-2.htm" title="That the king said to Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in an house of cedar, but the ark of God dwells within curtains.">2 Samuel 7:2</a> we learn that it was finished before he conceived the plan of building the Temple, at a time when Solomon was not yet born (ch. <a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm" title="And when your days be fulfilled, and you shall sleep with your fathers, I will set up your seed after you, which shall proceed out of your bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.">2 Samuel 7:12</a> : cp. <a href="/1_chronicles/22-9.htm" title="Behold, a son shall be born to you, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies round about: for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness to Israel in his days.">1 Chronicles 22:9</a>), and probably some twenty-five years before the close of his reign.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>If the statements of Menander and Josephus are accurate, we must suppose that the Hiram here mentioned was either the father or the grandfather of Solomon’s ally. His father is called by Menander <span class="ital">Abibaal</span>, but he may have borne both names, or the more familiar name of his son may have been attached to him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is probable that the historian to some extent forsakes chronological order, and places the account of David’s palace-building and of his family here by anticipation in proof of the statement of <span class="ital"><a href="/2_samuel/5-10.htm" title="And David went on, and grew great, and the LORD God of hosts was with him.">2 Samuel 5:10</a></span>.

When the Israelites entered Canaan, it was already noted for its strength (<a href="/joshua/19-29.htm" title="And then the coast turns to Ramah, and to the strong city Tyre; and the coast turns to Hosah; and the outgoings thereof are at the sea from the coast to Achzib:">Joshua 19:29</a>). Three causes co-operated to bring Phoenicia into close and friendly relation with Israel. (<span class="ital">a</span>) The contiguity of the countries, and the short distance between their capitals. From Tyre to Jerusalem by land was scarcely more than 100 miles, so that intercourse was easy. (<span class="ital">b</span>) Similarity of language. Phoenician so closely resembles Hebrew, that it must have been readily intelligible to the Israelites. (<span class="ital">c</span>) Tyre depended upon Palestine for its supplies of wheat and oil, and in return sent to Jerusalem its articles of commerce, and provided skilled workmen for the buildings erected by David and Solomon.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">cedar trees</span>] Felled no doubt in the forests of Lebanon, and brought by sea to Joppa. Cp. <a href="/2_chronicles/2-16.htm" title="And we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as you shall need: and we will bring it to you in floats by sea to Joppa; and you shall carry it up to Jerusalem.">2 Chronicles 2:16</a>. The cedar was the prince of trees (<a href="/psalms/104-16.htm" title="The trees of the LORD are full of sap; the cedars of Lebanon, which he has planted;">Psalm 104:16</a>), the emblem of strength and stature and grandeur (<a href="/psalms/92-12.htm" title="The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.">Psalm 92:12</a>; <a href="/amos/2-9.htm" title="Yet destroyed I the Amorite before them, whose height was like the height of the cedars, and he was strong as the oaks; yet I destroyed his fruit from above, and his roots from beneath.">Amos 2:9</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/31-3.htm" title="Behold, the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with fair branches, and with a shadowing shroud, and of an high stature; and his top was among the thick boughs.">Ezekiel 31:3</a>). Its timber was highly prized for building on account of its durability. Other species of pine besides the well-known cedar of Lebanon were probably included under the general term <span class="ital">cedar</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">they built David a house</span>] Psalms 30, which is entitled “A song at the Dedication of the House,” may possibly have been written to celebrate the completion of this palace. If so, David had just recovered from a severe illness, concerning which the history is silent.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hiram King of Tyre.</span> At first sight it seems as if the Hiram who so greatly aided Solomon in the building of the temple was the same person as David's friend (<a href="/1_kings/5-10.htm">1 Kings 5:10</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/2-3.htm">2 Chronicles 2:3</a>), but this identification is disproved by the express statement in <a href="/2_chronicles/2-13.htm">2 Chronicles 2:13</a>, and by the chronology. For granting that this account of Hiram's embassy occurs in a general summary, yet David would not long defer the erection of a palace, and in the history of Bathsheba we find, as a matter of fact, that it was then already built (<a href="/2_samuel/11-2.htm">2 Samuel 11:2</a>). But as Solomon was grown to manhood at his father's death, David's sin must have been committed not more than nine or ten years after he became king of all Israel. Now, we are told by Josephus ('Contr. Apion,' 1:18), on the authority of Menander of Ephesus, that Hiram reigned in all thirty years. But in <a href="/1_kings/9-10.htm">1 Kings 9:10-13</a> we have an account of a transaction with Hiram in Solomon's twentieth year. In another place ('Ant.,' 8:03. 1) Josephus tells us that Hiram had been King of Tyre eleven years when Solomon, in the fourth year of his reign, began the building of the temple. He would thus have been a contemporary of David for only the last seven or eight years of his reign. But the history of this embassy is given as a proof of David's establishment in his kingdom, and cannot therefore be referred to so late a period in his lifetime, when it would have lost its interest. The improbability of two successive kings having the same name is not, after all, so very great, especially as we do not know what the word <span class="accented">Hiram</span>, or <span class="accented">Haram</span>, exactly means. Nor is Menander's statement conclusive against it, where he says that Hiram's father was named Abibal - "Baal is my father." This would probably be an official name, borne by Hiram as the defender of the national religion, or as a priest king. There is, therefore, no real reason for rejecting the statement in <a href="/2_chronicles/2-13.htm">2 Chronicles 2:13</a> that Hiram, or as he is there called Huram, David's friend, was the father of the Huram who was Solomon's ally. <span class="cmt_word">Cedar trees.</span> Cedar wood was greatly valued both for its fragrance and durability, owing to the resin which it contains preserving it from the attacks of insects. Its colour also is soft and pleasing to the eye, as may be seen in the Jerusalem Chamber in Westminster Abbey, the panels of which are of cedar. It did not grow in the Antilibanus, or eastern part of Lebanon, which belonged to Israel, but only in the western part, which belonged to Tyre. Cedar from the time of David became the favourite material at Jerusalem for the interior of houses (<a href="/jeremiah/22-14.htm">Jeremiah 22:14</a>), and Isaiah charges the people of Samaria with pride for not being content with the native sycomores which had satisfied their fathers, but substituting for it this costly foreign timber (<a href="/isaiah/9-10.htm">Isaiah 9:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Carpenters and masons.</span> The necessity of importing "workers of wood, and workers of stone for walls," as the words literally mean, proves how miserable was the social state of Israel in David's time. Though they had been slaves in Egypt, yet at the Exodus the Israelites had men capable of working in the precious metals and jewelry, in weaving and embroidery, in wood carving, and even in the cutting of gems (<a href="/exodus/35-30.htm">Exodus 35:30-35</a>). During the long anarchy of the judges they had degenerated into a race of agricultural drudges, whom the  Philistines had debarred from the use of even the simplest tools (<a href="/1_samuel/13-19.htm">1 Samuel 13:19</a>). Possibly in Saul's time there was a faint restoration of the arts of civilized life (<a href="/2_samuel/1-24.htm">2 Samuel 1:24</a>); but when we find Joab killing Absalom, not with darts, but with pointed stakes (<a href="/2_samuel/18-14.htm">2 Samuel 18:14</a>), the weapons probably of most of the foot soldiers, we see that not much had been done even then in metallurgy; and here earlier in his reign David has to send to Tyre for men who could saw a plank or build a wall. When, then, we call to mind the high state of culture and the magnificence of Solomon's reign, we can form some idea of the vigour with which David raised his subjects from a state of semi-barbarism. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The age of David when he began to reign is given here, viz., thirty years old; also the length of his reign, viz., seven years and a half at Hebron over Judah, and thirty-three years at Jerusalem over Israel and Judah. In the books of Chronicles these statements occur at the close of David's reign (<a href="/1_chronicles/29-27.htm">1 Chronicles 29:27</a>). </body></html>
