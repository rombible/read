But the pride and insolence of the Jebusites animated David, and the Lord God of hosts was with him. Thus in the day of God's power, Satan's strong-hold, the human heart, is changed into a habitation of God through the Spirit, and into a throne on which the Son of David rules, and brings every thought into obedience to himself.

The total area of the hill top was about sixty acres, and it was now quickly covered with houses, and called "the city of David," after its captor. The view of Dr. Birch and others, that the stronghold of Zion was Ophel, is rendered untenable by the fact that this southern tongue of Mount Moriah is completely commanded by other parts of the hill. According to Gesenius, Zion means "sunny;" others render it "the dry hill;" others, "lofty;" and Furst, "the castle." None of these derivations is of any real value, as the word is probably Hittite. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>David Anointed King over all Israel. - <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-1.htm">2 Samuel 5:1-3</a> (compare with this the parallel passages in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-1.htm">1 Chronicles 11:1-3</a>). After the death of Ishbosheth, all the tribes of Israel (except Judah) came to Hebron in the persons of their representatives the elders (vid., <a href="/2_samuel/5-3.htm">2 Samuel 5:3</a>), in response to the summons of Abner (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-17.htm">2 Samuel 3:17-19</a>), to do homage to David as their king. They assigned three reasons for their coming: (1.) "Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh," i.e., thy blood-relations, inasmuch as all the tribes of Israel were lineal descendants of Jacob (vid., <a href="/genesis/29-14.htm">Genesis 29:14</a>; <a href="/judges/9-2.htm">Judges 9:2</a>). (2.) "In time past, when Saul was king over us, thou wast the leader of Israel (thou leddest out and broughtest in Israel)," i.e., thou didst superintend the affairs of Israel (see at <a href="/numbers/27-17.htm">Numbers 27:17</a>; and for the fact itself, <a href="/1_samuel/18-5.htm">1 Samuel 18:5</a>). &#1502;&#1493;&#1510;&#1497;&#1488; &#1492;&#1497;&#1497;&#1514;&#1492; is an error in writing for &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1510;&#1497;&#1488; &#1492;&#1497;&#1497;&#1514;, and &#1502;&#1489;&#1497; for &#1502;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488;, with the &#1488; dropped, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/21-21.htm">1 Kings 21:21</a>, etc. (vid., Olshausen, Gr. p. 69). (3.) They ended by asserting that Jehovah had called him to be the shepherd and prince over His people. The remarks which we have already made at <a href="/2_samuel/3-18.htm">2 Samuel 3:18</a> respecting Abner's appeal to a similar utterance on the part of Jehovah, are equally applicable to the words of Jehovah to David which are quoted here: "Thou shalt feed my people Israel," etc. On the Piska, see the note to <a href="/joshua/4-1.htm">Joshua 4:1</a>.</body></html>
