The kingdom of the Messiah, as soon as it was set up in the world, was thus attacked by the powers of darkness. The heathen raged, and the kings of the earth set themselves to oppose it; but all in vain, Ps 2:1, &c. The destruction will turn, as this did, upon Satan's own kingdom. David owns dependence on God for victory; and refers himself to the good pleasure of God, Wilt thou do it? The assurance God has given us of victory over our spiritual enemies, should encourage us in our spiritual conflicts. David waited till God moved; he stirred then, but not till then. He was trained up in dependence on God and his providence. God performed his promise, and David failed not to improve his advantages. When the kingdom of the Messiah was to be set up, the apostles, who were to beat down the devil's kingdom, must not attempt any thing till they received the promise of the Spirit; who came with a sound from heaven, as of a rushing, mighty wind, Ac 2:2.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The hold - Not the same place which is so named in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-7.htm">2 Samuel 5:7</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-9.htm">2 Samuel 5:9</a>, but probably the cave (or hold) of Adullam <a href="/2_samuel/23-13.htm">2 Samuel 23:13</a>.

Taking many wives was indeed prohibited in the law of the king in <a href="/deuteronomy/17-17.htm">Deuteronomy 17:17</a>; but as a large harem was considered from time immemorial as part of the court of an oriental monarch, David suffered himself to be seduced by that custom to disregard this prohibition, and suffered many a heartburn afterwards in consequence, not to mention his fearful fall in consequence of his passion for Bathsheba. The concubines are mentioned before the wives, probably because David had taken many of them to Jerusalem, and earlier than the wives. In the Chronicles the concubines and omitted, though not "intentionally," as they are mentioned in <a href="/1_chronicles/3-9.htm">1 Chronicles 3:9</a>; but as being of no essential importance in relation to the list of sons which follows, because no difference was made between those born of concubines and those born of wives. "Out of Jerusalem," i.e., away from Jerusalem: not that the wives were all born in Jerusalem, as the words which follow, "after he was come from Hebron," clearly show. In the Chronicles, therefore, it is explained as meaning "in Jerusalem." The sons are mentioned again both in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/14-5.htm">1 Chronicles 14:5-7</a> and in the genealogy in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-5.htm">1 Chronicles 3:5-8</a>. Shammua is called Shimea in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-5.htm">1 Chronicles 3:5</a>, according to a different pronunciation. Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon were sons of Bathsheba according to <a href="/1_chronicles/3-5.htm">1 Chronicles 3:5</a>.</body></html>
