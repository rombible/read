It is prophesied of the gospel church, The sons of strangers shall build up thy walls, and their kings shall minister unto thee, Isa 60:10. David's government was rooted and built up. David was established king; so is the Son of David, and all who, through him, are made to our God kings and priests. Never had the nation of Israel appeared so great as it began now to be. Many have the favour and love of God, yet do not perceive it, and so want the comfort of it; but to be exalted to that, and to perceive it, is happiness.

The first four were sons of Bathsheba, and as Solomon is always placed last it is natural to suppose that he was the youngest.

It was through the latter that Joseph traced his lineal descent from David, according to the genealogy of our Lord given by St Luke (<a href="/2_samuel/3-31.htm" title="And David said to Joab, and to all the people that were with him, Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn before Abner.

This explanatory remark anticipates the course of events, as David did not give this name to the conquered citadel, until he had chosen it as his residence and capital (vid., <a href="/2_samuel/5-9.htm">2 Samuel 5:9</a>). &#1510;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1503; (Sion), from &#1510;&#1497;&#1492;, to be dry: the dry or arid mountain or hill. This was the name of the southern and loftiest mountain of Jerusalem. Upon this stood the fortress or citadel of the town, which had hitherto remained in the possession of the Jebusites; whereas the northern portion of the city of Jerusalem, which was upon lower ground, had been conquered by the Judaeans and Benjaminites very shortly after the death of Joshua (see at <a href="/judges/1-8.htm">Judges 1:8</a>). - In <a href="/2_samuel/5-8.htm">2 Samuel 5:8</a> we have one circumstance mentioned which occurred in connection with this conquest. On that day, i.e., when he had advanced to the attack of the citadel Zion, David said, "Every one who smites the Jebusites, let him hurl into the waterfall (i.e., down the precipice) both the lame and blind, who are hateful to David's soul." This is most probably the proper interpretation of these obscure words of David, which have been very differently explained. Taking up the words of the Jebusites, David called all the defenders of the citadel of Zion "lame and blind," and ordered them to be cast down the precipice without quarter. &#1510;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512; signifies a waterfall (catarracta) in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/42-8.htm">Psalm 42:8</a>, the only other passage in which it occurs, probably from &#1510;&#1504;&#1512;, to roar. This meaning may also be preserved here, if we assume that at the foot of the steep precipice of Zion there was a waterfall probably connected with the water of Siloah. It is true we cannot determine anything with certainty concerning it, as, notwithstanding the many recent researches in Jerusalem, the situation of the Jebusite fortress and the character of the mountain of Zion in ancient times are quite unknown to us. This explanation of the word zinnor is simpler than Ewald's assumption that the word signifies the steep side of a rock, which merely rests upon the fact that the Greek word &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; originally signifies a plunge.<p>(Note: The earliest translators have only resorted to guesses. The Seventy, with their &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3c9; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;, have combined &#1510;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512; with &#1510;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;, which they render now and then &#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1; or &#x3c1;&#788;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;. This is also done by the Syriac and Arabic. The Chaldee paraphrases in this manner: "who begins to subjugate the citadel." Jerome, who probably followed the Rabbins, has et tetigisset domatum fistulas (and touched the water-pipes); and Luther, "und erlanget die Dachrinnen" (like the English version, "whosoever getteth up to the gutter:" Tr.). Hitzig's notion, that zinnor signifies ear ("whosoever boxes the ears of the blind and lame") needs no refutation; nor does that of Fr. Bttcher, who proposes to follow the Alexandrian rendering, and refer zinnor to a "sword of honour or marshal's staff," which David promised to the victor.)<p>&#1493;&#1497;&#1490;&#1506; should be pointed as a Hiphil &#1493;&#1497;&#1490;&#1468;&#1506;. The Masoretic pointing &#1493;&#1497;&#1490;&#1468;&#1506; arises from their mistaken interpretation of the whole sentence. The Chethibh &#1513;&#1474;&#1504;&#1488;&#1493; might be the third pers. perf., "who hate David's soul;" only in that case the omission of &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; would be surprising, and consequently the Keri &#1513;&#1474;&#1504;&#1488;&#1497; is to be preferred. "From this," adds the writer, "the proverb arose, 'The blind and lame shall not enter the house;' " in which proverb the epithet "blind and lame," which David applied to the Jebusites who were hated by him, has the general signification of "repulsive persons," with whom one does not wish to have anything to do. In the Chronicles not only is the whole of <a href="/2_samuel/5-7.htm">2 Samuel 5:7</a> omitted, with the proverb to which the occurrence gave rise, but also the allusion to the blind and lame in the words spoken by the Jebusites (<a href="/2_samuel/5-6.htm">2 Samuel 5:6</a>); and another word of David's is substituted instead, namely, that David would make the man who first smote the Jebusites, i.e., who stormed their citadel, head and chief;<p>(Note: This is also inserted in the passage before us by the translators of the English version: "he shall be chief and captain." - Tr.)<p>and also the statement that Joab obtained the prize. The historical credibility of the statement cannot be disputed, as Thenius assumes, on the ground that Joab had already been chief (sar) for a long time, according to <a href="/2_samuel/2-13.htm">2 Samuel 2:13</a> : for the passage referred to says nothing of the kind; and there is a very great difference between the commander of an army in the time of war, and a "head and chief," i.e., a commander-in-chief. The statement in <a href="/2_samuel/5-8.htm">2 Samuel 5:8</a> with regard to Joab's part, the fortification of Jerusalem, shows very clearly that the author of the Chronicles had other and more elaborate sources in his possession, which contained fuller accounts than the author of our books has communicated.</body></html>
