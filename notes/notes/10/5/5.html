His advances were gradual, that his faith might be tried, and that he might gain experience. Thus his kingdom typified that of the Messiah, which was to come to its height by degrees. Thus Jesus became our Brother, took upon him our nature, dwelt in it that he might become our Prince and Saviour: thus the humbled sinner takes encouragement from the endearing relation, applies for his salvation, submits to his authority, and craves his protection.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The age of David is conclusive as to the fact that the earlier years of Saul's reign (during which Jonathan grew up to be a man) are passed over in silence, and that the events narrated from <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/13.htm">1 Samuel 13</a> to the end of the book did not occupy more than 10 years. If David was 20 years old at the time he killed Goliath, four years in Saul's service, four years of wandering from place to place, one year and four months in the country of the Philistines, and a few months after Saul's death, would make up the 10 years necessary to bring him to the age of 30. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. King David made a league with them in Hebron before the Lord&#8212;(see on [260]1Sa 10:17). This formal declaration of the constitution was chiefly made at the commencement of a new dynasty, or at the restoration of the royal family after a usurpation (2Ki 11:17), though circumstances sometimes led to its being renewed on the accession of any new sovereign (1Ki 12:4).

The Capture of Jebus<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>&nbsp;= <a href="/context/1_chronicles/11-4.htm" title="And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, which is Jebus; where the Jebusites were, the inhabitants of the land....">1 Chronicles 11:4-9</a><span class="bld">6</span>. <span class="ital">to Jerusalem</span>, &c.] The Chronicler paraphrases the text thus, “to Jerusalem, which is Jebus, where the Jebusites were, the inhabitants of the land.” Writing after the Captivity, he felt it necessary to explain how the Jebusites came to be dwelling in Jerusalem by a reference to its ancient name of Jebus.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is not a little remarkable that the metropolis of the Jewish monarchy, the most sacred city in the world, does not take its place in the history of the nation until a comparatively late period.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>As the capital of the important Canaanite tribe of the Jebusites, it bore the name of <span class="ital">Jebus</span>. It was assigned to Benjamin (<a href="/joshua/18-28.htm" title="And Zelah, Eleph, and Jebusi, which is Jerusalem, Gibeath, and Kirjath; fourteen cities with their villages. This is the inheritance of the children of Benjamin according to their families.">Joshua 18:28</a>), but, lying on the border, was first attacked by Judah (<a href="/judges/1-8.htm" title="Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had taken it, and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.">Jdg 1:8</a>), and afterwards by Benjamin (<a href="/judges/1-21.htm" title="And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day.">Jdg 1:21</a>). The citadel was either never taken, or soon recovered, for the Jebusites retained joint possession of the city along with the children of Judah and Benjamin through the period of the Judges and down to this time (<a href="/joshua/15-63.htm" title="As for the Jebusites the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the children of Judah could not drive them out; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Judah at Jerusalem to this day.">Joshua 15:63</a>; <a href="/judges/1-21.htm" title="And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day.">Jdg 1:21</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Political, civil, and military considerations pointed to Jerusalem as the most suitable capital for the united kingdom.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="ital">a</span>) Its position within the territory of Benjamin yet close upon the borders of Judah (or, as some think, and as may be indicated by the passages quoted above, partly in one tribe, partly in the other), was excellently adapted for binding together the two royal tribes, and conciliating the good-will of Benjamin, without alienating Judah.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="ital">b</span>) Its situation was virtually central, not only with regard to these two great tribes, but for the whole land. “It was on the ridge of the backbone of hills, which extend through the whole country from the Desert to the plain of Esdraelon. Every traveller who has trod the central route of Palestine from north to south, must have passed through the table-land of Jerusalem.” Stanley’s <span class="ital">Sinai and Pal.</span> p. 176.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="ital">c</span>) As a military post it was unrivalled.

He replied, "As Jehovah liveth, who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity, the man who told me, Behold, Saul is dead, and thought he was a messenger of good to me, I seized and slew at Ziklag (vid., <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-14.htm">2 Samuel 1:14-15</a>), to give him a reward for his news: how much more when wicked men have murdered a righteous man in his house upon his bed, should I not require his blood at your hand, and destroy you from the earth?" The several parts of this reply are not closely linked together so as to form one period, but answer to the excited manner in which they were spoken. There is first of all the oath, "As truly as Jehovah liveth," and the clause appended, "who redeemed my soul," in which the thought is implied that David did not feel it necessary to get rid of his enemies by the commission of crimes. After this (<a href="/2_samuel/4-10.htm">2 Samuel 4:10</a>) we have an allusion to his treatment of the messenger who announced Saul's death to him, and pretended to have slain him in order that he might obtain a good reward for his tidings. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, like &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;, simply introduces the address. &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493; ... &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491; is placed at the head absolutely, and made subordinate to the verb by &#1489;&#1493; after &#1493;&#1488;&#1495;&#1494;&#1492;. &#1500;&#1514;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1470;&#1500;&#1493;, "namely, to give him." &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; is employed to introduce the explanation, like our "namely" (vid., Ewald, 338, b.). &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1492;, good news, here "the reward of news." The main point follows in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/4-11.htm">2 Samuel 4:11</a>, beginning with &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1488;&#1507;, "how much more" (vid., Ewald, 354, c.), and is introduced in the form of a climax. The words &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493; ... &#1488;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; are also written absolutely, and placed at the head: "men have slain," for "how much more in this instance, when wicked men have slain." "Righteous" (zaddik), i.e., not guilty of any wicked deed or crime. The assumption of the regal power, which Abner had forced upon Ishbosheth, was not a capital crime in the existing state of things, and after the death of Saul; and even if it had been, the sons of Rimmon had no right to assassinate him. David's sentence then follows: "And now that this is the fact, that ye have murdered a righteous man, should I not," etc. &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;, to destroy by capital punishment, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/13-6.htm">Deuteronomy 13:6</a>, etc. &#1491;&#1468;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; ( equals &#1491;&#1468;&#1501; &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;, <a href="/genesis/9-5.htm">Genesis 9:5</a>), to require the blood of a person, i.e., to take blood-revenge. </body></html>
