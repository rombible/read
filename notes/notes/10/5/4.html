His advances were gradual, that his faith might be tried, and that he might gain experience. Thus his kingdom typified that of the Messiah, which was to come to its height by degrees. Thus Jesus became our Brother, took upon him our nature, dwelt in it that he might become our Prince and Saviour: thus the humbled sinner takes encouragement from the endearing relation, applies for his salvation, submits to his authority, and craves his protection.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The age of David is conclusive as to the fact that the earlier years of Saul's reign (during which Jonathan grew up to be a man) are passed over in silence, and that the events narrated from <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/13.htm">1 Samuel 13</a> to the end of the book did not occupy more than 10 years. If David was 20 years old at the time he killed Goliath, four years in Saul's service, four years of wandering from place to place, one year and four months in the country of the Philistines, and a few months after Saul's death, would make up the 10 years necessary to bring him to the age of 30. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3.

He replied, "As Jehovah liveth, who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity, the man who told me, Behold, Saul is dead, and thought he was a messenger of good to me, I seized and slew at Ziklag (vid., <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-14.htm">2 Samuel 1:14-15</a>), to give him a reward for his news: how much more when wicked men have murdered a righteous man in his house upon his bed, should I not require his blood at your hand, and destroy you from the earth?" The several parts of this reply are not closely linked together so as to form one period, but answer to the excited manner in which they were spoken. There is first of all the oath, "As truly as Jehovah liveth," and the clause appended, "who redeemed my soul," in which the thought is implied that David did not feel it necessary to get rid of his enemies by the commission of crimes. After this (<a href="/2_samuel/4-10.htm">2 Samuel 4:10</a>) we have an allusion to his treatment of the messenger who announced Saul's death to him, and pretended to have slain him in order that he might obtain a good reward for his tidings. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, like &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;, simply introduces the address. &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493; ... &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491; is placed at the head absolutely, and made subordinate to the verb by &#1489;&#1493; after &#1493;&#1488;&#1495;&#1494;&#1492;. &#1500;&#1514;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1470;&#1500;&#1493;, "namely, to give him." &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; is employed to introduce the explanation, like our "namely" (vid., Ewald, 338, b.). &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1492;, good news, here "the reward of news." The main point follows in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/4-11.htm">2 Samuel 4:11</a>, beginning with &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1488;&#1507;, "how much more" (vid., Ewald, 354, c.), and is introduced in the form of a climax. The words &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493; ... &#1488;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; are also written absolutely, and placed at the head: "men have slain," for "how much more in this instance, when wicked men have slain." "Righteous" (zaddik), i.e., not guilty of any wicked deed or crime. The assumption of the regal power, which Abner had forced upon Ishbosheth, was not a capital crime in the existing state of things, and after the death of Saul; and even if it had been, the sons of Rimmon had no right to assassinate him. David's sentence then follows: "And now that this is the fact, that ye have murdered a righteous man, should I not," etc. &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;, to destroy by capital punishment, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/13-6.htm">Deuteronomy 13:6</a>, etc. &#1491;&#1468;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; ( equals &#1491;&#1468;&#1501; &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;, <a href="/genesis/9-5.htm">Genesis 9:5</a>), to require the blood of a person, i.e., to take blood-revenge. </body></html>
