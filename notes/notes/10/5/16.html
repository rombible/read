It is prophesied of the gospel church, The sons of strangers shall build up thy walls, and their kings shall minister unto thee, Isa 60:10. David's government was rooted and built up. David was established king; so is the Son of David, and all who, through him, are made to our God kings and priests. Never had the nation of Israel appeared so great as it began now to be. Many have the favour and love of God, yet do not perceive it, and so want the comfort of it; but to be exalted to that, and to perceive it, is happiness. David owned it was for his people's sake God had done great things for him; that he might be a blessing to them, and that they might be happy under him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Hiram king of Tyre - Now mentioned for the first time.
