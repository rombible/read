And perhaps they learned this from the Israelites, who carried the ark (the symbol of God’s presence) in their army when they went to fight with the Philistines; who saw it, and took it, as the Israelites now did their images, <a href="/context/1_samuel/4-4.htm" title="So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from there the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts, which dwells between the cherubim: and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God....">1 Samuel 4:4-5</a>, &c. But behold here the difference between the ark and these images! When the ark fell into the hands of the Philistines it consumed them; but when these images fell into the hands of the Israelites, they could neither hurt them, nor save themselves from being consumed.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:17-25 The Philistines considered not that David had the presence of God with him, which Saul had forfeited and lost. The kingdom of the Messiah, as soon as it was set up in the world, was thus attacked by the powers of darkness. The heathen raged, and the kings of the earth set themselves to oppose it; but all in vain, Ps 2:1, &c. The destruction will turn, as this did, upon Satan's own kingdom. David owns dependence on God for victory; and refers himself to the good pleasure of God, Wilt thou do it? The assurance God has given us of victory over our spiritual enemies, should encourage us in our spiritual conflicts. David waited till God moved; he stirred then, but not till then. He was trained up in dependence on God and his providence. God performed his promise, and David failed not to improve his advantages. When the kingdom of the Messiah was to be set up, the apostles, who were to beat down the devil's kingdom, must not attempt any thing till they received the promise of the Spirit; who came with a sound from heaven, as of a rushing, mighty wind, Ac 2:2.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And there they left their images - An indication of the precipitancy of their flight, and the suddenness with which the Israelites burst upon them like a "breach of waters."

For <span class="accented">images</span> we find "gods" in the parallel place in <a href="/1_chronicles/14-12.htm">1 Chronicles 14:12</a>, and the word used here is rendered "idols" in <a href="/1_samuel/31-9.htm">1 Samuel 31:9</a>. As the Philistines supposed that these images of their deities would ensure their victory, they would set great store by them, as the Israelites did by the ark (<a href="/1_samuel/4-4.htm">1 Samuel 4:4</a>), and the French by the oriflamme. Their capture, therefore, was a feat as great as the winning of the eagle of a Roman legion. <span class="cmt_word">David and his men burned them;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">took them away.</span> This translation of the Authorized Version, made to force the words into verbal agreement with <a href="/1_chronicles/14-12.htm">1 Chronicles 14:12</a>, is utterly indefensible; and, like most wrong things, it is absurd. The Bible cannot be improved by frauds, and really the two narratives complete one another. David and his men carried off these images as trophies, just as the Philistines carried off the ark (<a href="/1_samuel/4-11.htm">1 Samuel 4:11</a>). But the ark proved mightier than the Philistine gods, and in terror the people restored it to Israel. But no avenging hand interfered to rescue these gods, and, after being paraded in triumph, they were made into a bonfire. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Elishua is written incorrectly in <a href="/1_chronicles/3-6.htm">1 Chronicles 3:6</a> as Elishama, because Elishama follows afterwards. There are two names after Elishua in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-6.htm">1 Chronicles 3:6-7</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/14-6.htm">1 Chronicles 14:6-7</a>, viz., Eliphalet and Nogah, which have not crept into the text from oversight or from a wrong spelling of other names, because the number of the names is given as nine in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-8.htm">1 Chronicles 3:8</a>, and the two names must be included in order to bring out that number. And, on the other hand, it is not by the mistake of a copyist that they have been omitted from the text before us, but it has evidently been done deliberately on account of their having died in infancy, or at a very early age. This also furnishes a very simple explanation of the fact, that the name Eliphalet occurs again at the end of the list, namely, because a son who was born later received the name of his brother who had died young. Eliada, the last but one, is called Beeliada in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/14-7.htm">1 Chronicles 14:7</a>, another form of the name, compounded with Baal instead of El. David had therefore nineteen sons, six of whom were born in Hebron (<a href="/2_samuel/3-2.htm">2 Samuel 3:2</a>.), and thirteen at Jerusalem. Daughters are not mentioned in the genealogical accounts, because as a rule only heiresses or women who acquired renown from special causes were included in them. There is a daughter named Thamar mentioned afterwards in <a href="/2_samuel/13-1.htm">2 Samuel 13:1</a>. </body></html>
