Millo appears to have been a fortress of some kind, the northern defense of the city of David, and to have been a part of the original Canaanite defenses of Zion, as appears probable also from there having been a fortress called the house of Millo in the Canaanite city of Shechem. (<a href="/judges/9-6.htm">Judges 9:6</a> note, and <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/9-1.htm">2 Samuel 9:1-13</a> :20.) Millo may be the native name.

(Compare <a href="/1_chronicles/11-8.htm">1 Chronicles 11:8</a>.) The buildings were within, on the south of Millo, so as to be protected by it on the north, as they were east, west. and south, by the precipitous ravines. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9.

Millo is supposed to be a ditch round the fort, full of water, from whence it had its name; or was a large hollow place which divided the fort from the lower city, and which afterwards Solomon filled up, and made it a level, and therefore is called so here by anticipation; though Jarchi says it was done by David. According to Dr. Lightfoot (o), it was a part or Sion, or some hillock, east up against it on the west side; his first sense is best, Millo being no other than the fortress or citadel; which, as Josephus says (p), David joined to the lower city, and made them one body, and erecting walls about it made Joab superintendent of them; and this was the "round about", or circuit, which David made, reaching from Millo, or the citadel, to that again, which is meant by "inward", or "to the house" (q), as it should be rendered; that is, to the house of Millo, as in <a href="/2_kings/12-20.htm">2 Kings 12:20</a>; and so it is said <a href="/1_chronicles/11-8.htm">1 Chronicles 11:8</a>; that David built the city "from Millo round about"; that is, to the same place from whence he began (r). <p>(o) Works, vol. 2.

His works began from "the Millo," rendered "the citadel" by the LXX. Many, deriving the name from a Hebrew root signifying to fill, think that it was a mound, but Nature had herself supplied fit heights for defence, and it is evident that the place was called "the Millo" when David captured the city. We find "Beth-Millo" also in <a href="/judges/9-6.htm">Judges 9:6, 20</a>, where it signifies those who held the citadel of Shechem; and this Mills at Jerusalem was without doubt the old Jebusite keep, and the explanation of its name must be sought in the Jebusite language. As it formed one of the strongest defences of the city, it was rebuilt by Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/9-24.htm">1 Kings 9:24</a>; <a href="/1_kings/11-27.htm">1 Kings 11:27</a>), and repaired by Hezekiah (<a href="/2_chronicles/32-5.htm">2 Chronicles 32:5</a>) in preparation for the Assyrian  attack. Probably it stood at a corner, whence the phrase, "round about from the Millo and inward," or, as it is expressed in <a href="/1_chronicles/11-8.htm">1 Chronicles 11:8</a>, "from the Millo inward," that is, starting from. the Millo, the walls enclosed the space behind it. In the parallel place (<a href="/1_chronicles/11-8.htm">1 Chronicles 11:8</a>) we find an interesting addition to the narrative, namely, that "Joab repaired the rest of the city." It appears from this that the Jebusites had occupied a good deal of the ground with their habitations, though probably the number of the tribe was not great; or possibly there remained old buildings which were the remains of the Hittite city, and which, being of massive construction, were easily made fit once again for human habitation. We see also proof of Joab's great ability in peace as well as in war. He it was who had captured the stronghold, and it was now his office to arrange the streets and plan of the city, and to assign dwellings to David's mighty men. This would be a work sure to cause jealousy and heart burnings, and no one but Joab, their old commander, could have satisfied them. We find that he assigned to one of them, Uriah the Hittite, a space of ground for a dwelling close to the royal palace. We may suppose, then, that David was now fully reconciled to the "hard sons of Zeruiah" (<a href="/2_samuel/3-39.htm">2 Samuel 3:39</a>), and in the stern wars which followed David's election, he needed and had the full benefit of their vigour and ability. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"All the elders of Israel came" is a repetition of <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-1.htm">2 Samuel 5:1</a>, except that the expression "all the tribes of Israel" is more distinctly defined as meaning "all the elders of Israel." "So all the elders came; ... and king David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the Lord (see at <a href="/2_samuel/3-21.htm">2 Samuel 3:21</a>): and they anointed David king over (all) Israel." The writer of the Chronicles adds, "according to the word of the Lord through Samuel," i.e., so that the command of the Lord to Samuel, to anoint David king over Israel (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-1.htm">1 Samuel 16:1</a>, <a href="/1_samuel/16-12.htm">1 Samuel 16:12</a>), found its complete fulfilment in this.</body></html>
