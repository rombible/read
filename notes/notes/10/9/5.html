Yet persons of real godliness will have no rest till they have discharged them. And the most proper objects of kindness and charity, frequently will not be found without inquiry. Jonathan was David's sworn friend, therefore he shows kindness to his son Mephibosheth. God is faithful to us; let us not be unfaithful to one another. If Providence has raised us, and our friends and their families are brought low, we must look upon that as giving us the fairer opportunity of being kind to them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>David reaped the fruit of his kindness to Mephibosheth, for, when he fled from Absalom, Machir, the son of Ammiel, was one of those who were most liberal in providing him and his army with necessaries (marginal reference). According to <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-5.htm">1 Chronicles 3:5</a>, Ammiel (called inversely Eliam, <a href="/2_samuel/11-3.htm">2 Samuel 11:3</a>) was the father of Bath-sheba. If this be the same Ammiel, Machir would be Bath-sheba's brother. However, the name is not a very uncommon one (<a href="/numbers/13-12.htm">Numbers 13:12</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-5.htm">1 Chronicles 26:5</a>, etc.).<p>Lo-debar - Evidently on the east of Jordan River, and in the neighborhood of Ish-bosheth's capital, Mahanaim <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-27.htm">2 Samuel 17:27</a>, but not identified by any modern traveler.

David Sends for Mephibosheth.<p>1-7. David said, Is there yet any that is left of the house of Saul&#8212;On inquiry, Saul's land steward was found, who gave information that there still survived Mephibosheth, a son of Jonathan who was five years old at his father's death, and whom David, then wandering in exile, had never seen. His lameness (2Sa 4:4) had prevented him from taking any part in the public contests of the time. Besides, according to Oriental notions, the younger son of a crowned monarch has a preferable claim to the succession over the son of a mere heir-apparent; and hence his name was never heard of as the rival of his uncle Ish-bosheth. His insignificance had led to his being lost sight of, and it was only through Ziba that David learned of his existence, and the retired life he passed with one of the great families in trans-jordanic Canaan who remained attached to the fallen dynasty. Mephibosheth was invited to court, and a place at the royal table on public days was assigned him, as is still the custom with Eastern monarchs. Saul's family estate, which had fallen to David in right of his wife (Nu 27:8), or been forfeited to the crown by Ish-bosheth's rebellion (2Sa 12:8), was provided (2Sa 9:11; also 2Sa 19:28), for enabling Mephibosheth to maintain an establishment suitable to his rank, and Ziba appointed steward to manage it, on the condition of receiving one-half of the produce in remuneration for his labor and expense, while the other moiety was to be paid as rent to the owner of the land (2Sa 19:29).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then King David sent,....

Instead of Ahimelech, the Chronicles have Abimelech, evidently through a copyist's error, as the name is written Ahimelech in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24-3.htm">1 Chronicles 24:3</a>, <a href="/1_chronicles/24-6.htm">1 Chronicles 24:6</a>. But the expression "Ahimelech the son of Abiathar" is apparently a very strange one, as Abiathar was a son of Ahimelech according to <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-20.htm">1 Samuel 22:20</a>, and in other passages Zadok and Abiathar are mentioned as the two high priests in the time of David (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-24.htm">2 Samuel 15:24</a>, <a href="/2_samuel/15-35.htm">2 Samuel 15:35</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/17-15.htm">2 Samuel 17:15</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/19-12.htm">2 Samuel 19:12</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/20-25.htm">2 Samuel 20:25</a>). This difference cannot be set aside, as Movers, Thenius, Ewald, and other suppose, by transposing the names, so as to read Abiathar the son of Ahimelech; for such a solution is precluded by the fact that, in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24-3.htm">1 Chronicles 24:3</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24-6.htm">1 Chronicles 24:6</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24-31.htm">1 Chronicles 24:31</a>, Ahimelech is mentioned along with Zadok as head of the priests of the line of Ithamar, and according to <a href="/1_chronicles/24-6.htm">1 Chronicles 24:6</a> he was the son of Abiathar. It would therefore be necessary to change the name Ahimelech into Abiathar in this instance also, both in <a href="/1_chronicles/24-3.htm">1 Chronicles 24:3</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24-6.htm">1 Chronicles 24:6</a>, and in the latter to transpose the two names. But there is not the slightest probability in the supposition that the names have been changed in so many passaGes. We are therefore disposed to adopt the view held by Bertheau and Oehler, viz., that Abiathar the high priest, the son of Ahimelech, had also a son named Ahimelech, as it is by no means a rare occurrence for grandfather and grandson to have the same names (vid., <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-4.htm">1 Chronicles 6:4-15</a>), and also that this (the younger) Ahimelech performed the duties of high priest in connection with his father, who was still living at the commencement of Solomon's reign (<a href="/1_kings/2-27.htm">1 Kings 2:27</a>), and is mentioned in this capacity, along with Zadok, both here and in the book of Chronicles, possibly because Abiathar was ill, or for some other reason that we cannot discover. As Abiathar was thirty or thirty-five years old at the time when his father was put to death by Saul, according to what has already been observed at <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-3.htm">1 Samuel 14:3</a>, and forty years old at the death of Saul, he was at least forty-eight years old at the time when David removed his residence to Mount Zion, and might have had a son of twenty-five years of age, namely the Ahimelech mentioned here, who could have taken his father's place in the performance of the functions of high priest when he was prevented by illness or other causes. The appearance of a son of Abiathar named Jonathan in <a href="/2_samuel/15-27.htm">2 Samuel 15:27</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-17.htm">2 Samuel 17:17</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-20.htm">2 Samuel 17:20</a>, is no valid argument against this solution of the apparent discrepancy; for, according to these passages, he was still very young, and may therefore have been a younger brother of Ahimelech. The omission of any allusion to Ahimelech in connection with Abiathar's conspiracy with Adonijah against Solomon (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/1-42.htm">1 Kings 1:42-43</a>), and the reference to his son Jonathan alone, might be explained on the supposition that Ahimelech had already died. But as there is no reference to Jonathan at the time when his father was deposed, no stress is to be laid upon the omission of any reference to Ahimelech. Moreover, when Abiathar was deposed after Solomon had ascended the throne, he must have been about eighty years of age. Seraiah was a scribe. Instead of Seraiah, we have Shavsha in the corresponding text of the Chronicles, and Sheva in the parallel passage <a href="/2_samuel/20-25.htm">2 Samuel 20:25</a>. Whether the last name is merely a mistake for Shavsha, occasioned by the dropping of &#1513;&#1473;, or an abbreviated form of Shisha and Shavsha, cannot be decided. Shavsha is not a copyist's error, for in <a href="/1_kings/4-3.htm">1 Kings 4:3</a> the same man is unquestionably mentioned again under the name of Shisha, who is called Shavsha in the Chronicles, Sheva (&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1488;) in the text of <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-25.htm">2 Samuel 20:25</a>, and here Seraiah. Seraiah also is hardly a copyist's error, but another form for Shavsha or Shisha. The scribe was a secretary of state; not a military officer, whose duty it was to raise and muster the troops, for the technical expression for mustering the people was not &#1505;&#1508;&#1512;, but &#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1491; (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-2.htm">2 Samuel 24:2</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-4.htm">2 Samuel 24:4</a>,<a href="/2_samuel/24-9.htm">2 Samuel 24:9</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-5.htm">1 Chronicles 21:5-6</a>, etc.). </body></html>
