It remains to follow the LXX. in reading <span class="bld">at David’s table</span> for “at my table,” and to take the clause along with the next two verses as the narrator’s conclusion of the story, thus: “<span class="bld">So Mephibosheth did eat at David’s table, as one of the king’s sons.</span>”<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As for Mephibosheth,</span> said the king, <span class="cmt_word">he</span>, etc. These words are difficult, because they make David say the same thing thrice. The text is probably corrupt, as it requires the insertion of some such phrase as the "said the king" of the Authorized Version to make it intelligible. Of the many emendations proposed, the most probable is that of the LXX. and Syriac, which make this clause an observation of the historian pointing out the high honour done to Mephibosheth in placing him on an equality with David's own sons. It would then run as follows: So <span class="accented">Mephibosheth ate at the king's table as one of the king's sons.</span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>David sent for this son of Jonathan (Mephibosheth: cf. <a href="/2_samuel/4-4.htm">2 Samuel 4:4</a>), and not only restored his father's possessions in land, but took him to his own royal table for the rest of his life. "Fear not," said David to Mephibosheth, when he came before him with the deepest obeisance, to take away any anxiety lest the king should intend to slay the descendants of the fallen king, according to the custom of eastern usurpers. It is evident from the words, "I will restore thee all the land of Saul thy father," that the landed property belonging to Saul had either fallen to David as crown lands, or had been taken possession of by distant relations after the death of Saul. "Thou shalt eat bread at my table continually," i.e., eat at my table all thy life long, or receive thy food from my table.</body></html>
