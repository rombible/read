David Sends for Mephibosheth.<p>1-7. David said, Is there yet any that is left of the house of Saul&#8212;On inquiry, Saul's land steward was found, who gave information that there still survived Mephibosheth, a son of Jonathan who was five years old at his father's death, and whom David, then wandering in exile, had never seen. His lameness (2Sa 4:4) had prevented him from taking any part in the public contests of the time. Besides, according to Oriental notions, the younger son of a crowned monarch has a preferable claim to the succession over the son of a mere heir-apparent; and hence his name was never heard of as the rival of his uncle Ish-bosheth. His insignificance had led to his being lost sight of, and it was only through Ziba that David learned of his existence, and the retired life he passed with one of the great families in trans-jordanic Canaan who remained attached to the fallen dynasty. Mephibosheth was invited to court, and a place at the royal table on public days was assigned him, as is still the custom with Eastern monarchs. Saul's family estate, which had fallen to David in right of his wife (Nu 27:8), or been forfeited to the crown by Ish-bosheth's rebellion (2Sa 12:8), was provided (2Sa 9:11; also 2Sa 19:28), for enabling Mephibosheth to maintain an establishment suitable to his rank, and Ziba appointed steward to manage it, on the condition of receiving one-half of the produce in remuneration for his labor and expense, while the other moiety was to be paid as rent to the owner of the land (2Sa 19:29).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then the king called to Ziba, Saul's servant,....

The &#1500; before &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; is a roundabout way of expressing the genitive, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-18.htm">1 Samuel 16:18</a>, etc., and is obviously not to be altered into &#1502;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;, as Thenius proposes. "The kindness of God" is love and kindness shown in God, and for God's sake (<a href="/luke/6-36.htm">Luke 6:36</a>). Machir the son of Ammiel was a rich man, judging from <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-27.htm">2 Samuel 17:27</a>, who, after the death of Saul and Jonathan, had received the lame son of the latter into his house. Lodebar (&#1500;&#1493;&#1491;&#1489;&#1512;, written &#1500;&#1488;&#1491;&#1489;&#1512; in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-27.htm">2 Samuel 17:27</a>, but erroneously divided by the Masoretes into two words in both passages) was a town on the east of Mahanaim, towards Rabbath Amman, probably the same place as Lidbir (<a href="/joshua/13-26.htm">Joshua 13:26</a>); but it is not further known.</body></html>
