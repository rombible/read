David now little thought that the time would come when he himself should need his assistance. Let us be forward to give, because we know not what we ourselves may some time want. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:1-8 Amidst numerous affairs we are apt to forget the gratitude we owe, and the engagements we are under, not only to our friends, but to God himself. Yet persons of real godliness will have no rest till they have discharged them. And the most proper objects of kindness and charity, frequently will not be found without inquiry. Jonathan was David's sworn friend, therefore he shows kindness to his son Mephibosheth. God is faithful to us; let us not be unfaithful to one another. If Providence has raised us, and our friends and their families are brought low, we must look upon that as giving us the fairer opportunity of being kind to them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>David reaped the fruit of his kindness to Mephibosheth, for, when he fled from Absalom, Machir, the son of Ammiel, was one of those who were most liberal in providing him and his army with necessaries (marginal reference). According to <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-5.htm">1 Chronicles 3:5</a>, Ammiel (called inversely Eliam, <a href="/2_samuel/11-3.htm">2 Samuel 11:3</a>) was the father of Bath-sheba. If this be the same Ammiel, Machir would be Bath-sheba's brother. However, the name is not a very uncommon one (<a href="/numbers/13-12.htm">Numbers 13:12</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-5.htm">1 Chronicles 26:5</a>, etc.).<p>Lo-debar - Evidently on the east of Jordan River, and in the neighborhood of Ish-bosheth's capital, Mahanaim <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-27.htm">2 Samuel 17:27</a>, but not identified by any modern traveler. Thought by some, not improbably, to be the same as Debir <a href="/joshua/13-26.htm">Joshua 13:26</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 9<p>2Sa 9:1-12. David Sends for Mephibosheth.<p>1-7. David said, Is there yet any that is left of the house of Saul&#8212;On inquiry, Saul's land steward was found, who gave information that there still survived Mephibosheth, a son of Jonathan who was five years old at his father's death, and whom David, then wandering in exile, had never seen. His lameness (2Sa 4:4) had prevented him from taking any part in the public contests of the time. Besides, according to Oriental notions, the younger son of a crowned monarch has a preferable claim to the succession over the son of a mere heir-apparent; and hence his name was never heard of as the rival of his uncle Ish-bosheth. His insignificance had led to his being lost sight of, and it was only through Ziba that David learned of his existence, and the retired life he passed with one of the great families in trans-jordanic Canaan who remained attached to the fallen dynasty. Mephibosheth was invited to court, and a place at the royal table on public days was assigned him, as is still the custom with Eastern monarchs. Saul's family estate, which had fallen to David in right of his wife (Nu 27:8), or been forfeited to the crown by Ish-bosheth's rebellion (2Sa 12:8), was provided (2Sa 9:11; also 2Sa 19:28), for enabling Mephibosheth to maintain an establishment suitable to his rank, and Ziba appointed steward to manage it, on the condition of receiving one-half of the produce in remuneration for his labor and expense, while the other moiety was to be paid as rent to the owner of the land (2Sa 19:29).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> In a place beyond Jordan, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/2_samuel/17-27.htm" title="And it came to pass, when David was come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodebar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,">2 Samuel 17:27</a></span>, where his friends thought he might be kept out of David’s sight. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the king said unto him, where is he?....

Here it may be his mother's relations lived, and here he might dwell in obscurity, and lie hid from the knowledge of David; who, it might be feared by his friends, would have dispatched him, had he known where he was. Some take it to be an appellative, and render it, as Abarbinel observes, "without anything"; as if he was so poor that he had not anything to support himself with.

Of Lo-debar nothing is known, but it must have been east of the Jordan, near Mahanaim. Of Ammiel we read again in <a href="/2_samuel/17-27.htm">2 Samuel 17:27</a>, where we find that he was a man of wealth, who helped to supply the wants of David and his men during the rebellion of Absalom. Possibly this kindness of David towards one for whom he had feelings of loyalty, as representing a royal house to which he had remained faithful, won his heart. There was a magnanimity about it which would commend it to a man who was himself generous and true. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The chief ministers were the following: - Joab (see at <a href="/2_samuel/2-18.htm">2 Samuel 2:18</a>) was "over the army," i.e., commander-in-chief.
