But there is no contending with that God who can arm a man against himself, and destroy him by his own mistakes and passions. Ahithophel's former counsel was followed, for God intended to correct David; but his latter counsel was not followed, for God meant not to destroy him. He can overrule all counsels. Whatever wisdom or help any man employs or affords, the success is from God alone, who will not let his people perish.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Some pit, or in some other place - The Hebrew has "in one of the pits," or "in one of the places." Hence, "place" must have some defined meaning. It probably is used here, as elsewhere, for a "dwelling-house" or "village," which might in that district be fortified houses <a href="/2_samuel/17-12.htm">2 Samuel 17:12</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/26-25.htm">1 Samuel 26:25</a>.<p>Hushai's argument is that there was no chance of seizing David by surprise as Ahithophel suggested. There was sure to be sharp fighting, and the terror of the names of David, Joab, Abishai, Ittai, and their companions, would magnify the first few blows received into a victory, and Absalom's men would flee in panic. It is likely that Absalom was not a man of courage, and Hushai, knowing this, adroitly magnified the terror of the warlike prowess of David and his mighty men. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/17.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 17<p>2Sa 17:1-14. Ahithophel's Counsel Overthrown by Hushai.<p>1-11. Moreover Ahithophel said unto Absalom&#8212;The recommendation to take prompt and decisive measures before the royalist forces could be collected and arranged, evinced the deep political sagacity of this councillor. The adoption of his advice would have extinguished the cause of David; and it affords a dreadful proof of the extremities to which the heartless prince was, to secure his ambitious objects, prepared to go, that the parricidal counsel "pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel." It was happily overruled, however, by the address of Hushai, who saw the imminent danger to which it would expose the king and the royal cause. He dwelt upon the warlike character and military experience of the old king&#8212;represented him and his adherents as mighty men, who would fight with desperation; and who, most probably, secure in some stronghold, would be beyond reach, while the smallest loss of Absalom's men at the outset might be fatal to the success of the conspiracy. But his dexterity was chiefly displayed in that part of his counsel which recommended a general levy throughout the country; and that Absalom should take command of it in person&#8212;thereby flattering at once the pride and ambition of the usurper. The bait was caught by the vainglorious and wicked prince.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/17.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">He is hid now in some pit, or in some other place; </span> having been oft accustomed to that course, and well acquainted with all hidingplaces from Saul’s time.

Ahithophel said still further to Absalom, "I will choose out twelve thousand men, and arise, and pursue after David this night; and fall upon him when he is exhausted and weak, and fill him with alarm: so shall all the people that are with him flee; and I will smite the king alone (when he is alone), and will bring back all the people to thee." &#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492;, the night, is the night following the day of David's flight and Absalom's entrance into Jerusalem, as we may see very clearly from <a href="/2_samuel/17-16.htm">2 Samuel 17:16</a>. This advice was sagaciously conceived; for if David had been attacked that night by a powerful army, he might possibly have been defeated. &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489;&#1492;, to bring back, may be explained on the supposition that Ahithophel regarded Absalom as king, and those who had fled with David as rebels, who were to be brought back under Absalom's sceptre. The following words, &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500; &#1499;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;, "as the return of the whole (the whole nation) is the man," i.e., the return of all is dependent upon David, for whom thou liest in wait, are somewhat difficult, though the meaning of Ahithophel is evident enough from what precedes: viz., if he is beaten, they will all come over to thee; "the whole nation will be at peace" (&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; is used adverbially).<p>(Note: Consequently no conjectures are needed as to the rendering of the words in the lxx, viz., &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#768;&#x3c2; (al. &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;) &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3b7; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2;&#903; &#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#768; &#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2;, such as Ewald, Thenius, and Bttcher have attempted.
