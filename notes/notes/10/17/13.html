Ahithophel's former counsel was followed, for God intended to correct David; but his latter counsel was not followed, for God meant not to destroy him. He can overrule all counsels.

A strong fortified place, thinking to secure himself there, where he might hold out against those that were risen against him; the former part of the account supposes him in the field, where he would soon be detected, if hidden in a pit or any other place, or if he appeared openly would quickly be overthrown by the numerous forces of Absalom; and here it suggests, should he betake himself to a city for shelter: <p>then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city; scaling ropes, and thereby get upon and over the walls of it, and take it by storm; or engines worked with ropes, used for the demolishing of cities; so Tacitus speaks of "vincula tormentorum", the bands or ropes of engines, as Grotius observes; the Targum renders it by "armies", thus,"all Israel shall be gathered against the city, and surround it with armies,''besiege it in form, and so surround it that David could not possibly make his escape out of it, nor could it hold out long against such numerous forces; or this is an hyperbolical expression, as Kimchi calls it, signifying that their numbers would be so many, that they could soon and easily demolish it: <p>and we will draw it into the river; by the side of which it was built, or the ditch or trench around it, or the valley near it, that being built on an hill; and by this boasting, bragging, hyperbolical expression, he signifies that they should be able easily and utterly to destroy its walls, buildings, and towers, as if a number of men were to fasten a rope about anything, and by their main strength, and through their numbers, draw it down whither they pleased: <p>until there be not one small stone found there; and this being the case, David and his men must inevitably fall into their hands, and none escape. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_samuel/17.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Moreover, if he be gotten into a city, then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river, until there be not one small stone found there.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/2_samuel/17.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">13</span>. <span class="ital">into the river</span>] <span class="bld">Into the ravine.</span> Hushai intentionally indulges in an extravagant hyperbole in order to describe the irresistible power of the force that would be gathered, if he means to suggest the idea of dragging a city bodily down from the rock on which, like most fortified cities, it was built: but perhaps he means no more than that the city should be conquered and demolished as a penalty. Compare Micah’s prophecy of the destruction of Samaria, which stood on a hill: “I will pour down the stones thereof into the valley” (<a href="/micah/1-6.htm" title="Therefore I will make Samaria as an heap of the field, and as plantings of a vineyard: and I will pour down the stones thereof into the valley, and I will discover the foundations thereof.">Micah 1:6</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The river.</span> The word does not signify a river, but a ravine or gorge worn away by the action of a torrent. Such ravines are common in Palestine, where the streams rush along with resistless fury after the rains, but in summer are dry (<a href="/job/6-17.htm">Job 6:17</a>); and their desolate beds, bordered by precipitous cliffs, are described by Isaiah as favourite places for the cruel rites of Moloch (<a href="/isaiah/57-5.htm">Isaiah 57:5</a>). Dragged to the edge of one of these gorges, the city, with its few defenders, would topple over, and in the next rainy season be entirely swept away. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/17.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In answer to Absalom's inquiry, "Shall we do his word (i.e., follow Ahithophel's advice) or not?" Hushai said, "The advice is not good that Ahithophel hath given this time;" and then still further explained (<a href="/2_samuel/17-8.htm">2 Samuel 17:8</a>): "Thou knowest thy father and his men, that they are heroes, and of a ferocious disposition (like <a href="/judges/18-25.htm">Judges 18:25</a>), like a bear in the field robbed of her young; and thy father is a man of war, and will not pass the night with the people," sc., so that it would be possible to come upon him unawares and slay him (&#1500;&#1497;&#1503; with &#1488;&#1514;, as in <a href="/job/19-4.htm">Job 19:4</a>). The idea that &#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1503; is to be taken as a Hiphil, in the sense of "and does not let the people lodge for the night" (Bttcher), is quite untenable, since it does not tally with <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-9.htm">2 Samuel 17:9</a>, "Behold, he is hid now in one of the pits, or one of the places (&#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501; are hiding-places that are strong by nature, &#1502;&#1511;&#1493;&#1502;&#1514; are places rendered strong by art); and it comes to pass that he falls upon them at the first: so will men hear it, and say a defeat has taken place among the people that follow Absalom." &#1504;&#1508;&#1500; with &#1489;&#1468;, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/11-7.htm">Joshua 11:7</a>, to fall upon a person. The subject to &#1504;&#1508;&#1500; is David, but it is not mentioned as being evident enough from the context; so that there is no necessity for the emendation &#1504;&#1508;&#1500;&#1493;, which Thenius proposes. The suffix &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1501; relates to those making the attack, the hosts of Absalom. Thenius has given the meaning correctly: "The report that David has made an attack will be sufficient to give rise to the belief that our men have sustained a severe defeat."  </body></html>
