The Jewish royal family shall be reckoned with for their pride and vanity; and those that leap on the threshold, invading their neighbours' rights, and seizing their possessions. The trading people and the rich merchants are called to account. Secure and careless people are reckoned with. They are secure and easy; they say in their heart, the Lord will not do good, neither will he do evil; that is, they deny his dispensing rewards and punishments. But in the day of the Lord's judgment, it will clearly appear that those who perish, fall a sacrifice to Divine justice for breaking God's law, and because they have no interest by faith in the Redeemer's atoning sacrifice.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/zephaniah/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Howl, ye inhabitants of Maktesh - Literally, "Mortar" , "in which," Jerome says, "corn is pounded; a hollow vessel, and fit for the use of medical men, in which properly ptisans are wont to be beaten (or made). Striking is it, that Scripture saith not, 'who dwell in the valley or in the alley,' but who "dwell in the mortar," because as corn, when the pestle striketh, is bruised, so the army of the enemy shall rush down upon you" (Jerome). The place intended is probably so much of the valley of the Tyropoeon, which intersected Jerusalem from north to south, as was enclosed by the second wall, on the north, and the first wall on the south. The valley  "extended as far as the fountain of Siloam," and united with the valley of Jehoshaphat a little below Ophel. It was  "full of houses," and, from its name as well as from its situation, it was probably the scene of petty merchandise, where the occasions in which men could and did break the law and offend God, were the more continual, because they entered into their daily life, and were a part of it. The sound of the pestle was continually heard there; another sound should thereafter be heard, when they should not bruise, but be themselves bruised. The name "Maktesh" was probably chosen to express how their false hopes, grounded on the presence of God's temple among them while by their sins they profaned it, should be turned into true fears. They had been and thought themselves "Mikdash," "a holy place,. sanctuary;" they should be Maktesh , wherein all should be utterly bruised in pieces.<p>Jerome: "Whoso considereth the calamities of that siege, and how the city was pressed and hemmed in, will feel how aptly he calls them "the inhabitants of a mortar;" for, as grains of corn are brought together into a mortar, to the end that, when the pestle descendeth, being unable to fly off, they may be bruised, so the people flowing together, out of all the countries of Judaea, was narrowed in by a sudden siege, and through the savage cruelty of the above leaders of the sedition, was unutterably tortured from within, more than by the enemy without."<p>For all the merchant people are cut down - (Literally, "the people of Canaan") that is Ch.: "they who in deeds are like the people of Canaan," according to that , "Thou art of Canaan and not of Judah," and, "Thy father is an Amorite and thy mother a Hittite" . So our Lord says to the reprobate Jews, "Ye are of your father the devil" <a href="/john/8-44.htm">John 8:44</a>.<p>All they that bear silver are cut off - (Literally, "all laden with").

Maktesh&#8212;rather, "the mortar," a name applied to the valley of Siloam from its hollow shape [Jerome]. The valley between Zion and Mount Olivet, at the eastern extremity of Mount Moriah, where the merchants dwelt. Zec 14:21, "The Canaanite," namely, merchant [Chaldee Version]. The Tyropœon (that is, cheese-makers') valley below Mount Akra [Rosenmuller]. Better Jerusalem itself, so called as lying in the midst of hills (Isa 22:1; Jer 21:13) and as doomed to be the scene of its people being destroyed as corn or drugs are pounded in a mortar (Pr 27:22) [Maurer]. Compare the similar image of a "pot" (Eze 24:3, 6). The reason for the destruction is subjoined, namely, its merchant people's greediness of gain.<p>all the merchant people&#8212;literally, the "Canaanite people": irony: all the merchant people of Jerusalem are very Canaanites in greed for gain and in idolatries (see on [1168]Ho 12:7).<p>all &#8230; that bear silver&#8212;loading themselves with that which will prove but a burden (Hab 2:6).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/zephaniah/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Howl, </span> cry aloud, and bitterly, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">ye inhabitants of Maktesh:</span> some read it appellatively: the mortar in which of old, before the corn-mill was known and used, they did pound and beat their corn for bread; they also pounded spices.

The name of a street in Jerusalem, as Aben Ezra; perhaps it lay low in the hollow of the city, and in the form of a mortar, from whence it might have its name, as the word (q) signifies; which is used both for a hollow place and for a mortar, <a href="/judges/15-19.htm">Judges 15:19</a> unless it might be so called from such persons dwelling in it, that used mortars for spice, and other things. The Targum is, <p>"howl, all ye that dwell in the valley of Kidron;'' <p>and Jerom thinks the valley of Siloah is intended, which is the same; which, Adrichomius (r) says, was broad, deep, and dark, and surrounded the temple in manner of a foss, or ditch; and was disposed in the form of a mortar, called in Hebrew "machtes"; in Latin, "pila"; in which merchants and tradesmen of all kinds dwelt. It is thought by others to be the same which Josephus (s) calls "the valley of the cheese mongers", which lay between the two hills Zion and Acra. The reason of their howling is, <p>for all the merchant people are cut down; either cut to pieces by the sword of the enemy, and become silent, as the word (t) sometimes signifies, and the Vulgate Latin version here renders it; become so by death, and laid in the silent grave, and no more concerned in merchandise; or else stripped of all their wealth and goods by the enemy, and so cut down, broke, and become bankrupt, and could trade no more. The word for merchant signifies a Canaanite; and the Targum paraphrases it thus, <p>"for all the people are broken, whose works are like the works of the people of the land of Canaan:'' <p>all they that bear silver are cut off; that have large quantities of it, and carry it to market to buy goods with it as merchants; these shall be cut off, and so a great loss to trade, and a cause of howling and lamentation; or such that wear it in their garments, embroidered with it; or rather in their purses, who are loaded with this thick clay, abound with it.

It does not seem a very appropriate appellation for a lengthy valley like the Tyropceum, nor is there any trace of such a name being applied to it elsewhere.

"Hear ye, then, what Jehovah saith; Rise up, contend with the mountains, and let the hills hear thy voice! <a href="/micah/6-2.htm">Micah 6:2</a>. Hear ye, O mountains, Jehovah's contest; and ye immutable ones, ye foundations of the earth! For Jehovah has a contest with His people; and with Israel will He contend." In <a href="/micah/6-1.htm">Micah 6:1</a> the nation of Israel is addressed in its several members. They are to hear what the Lord says to the prophet, - namely, the summons addressed to the mountains and hills to hear Jehovah's contest with His people. The words "strive with the mountains" cannot be understood here as signifying that the mountains are the objects of the accusation, notwithstanding the fact that &#1512;&#1497;&#1489; &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1508; signifies to strive or quarrel with a person (<a href="/judges/8-1.htm">Judges 8:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/50-8.htm">Isaiah 50:8</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/2-9.htm">Jeremiah 2:9</a>); for, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/6-2.htm">Micah 6:2</a>, they are to hear the contest of Jehovah with Israel, and therefore are to be merely witnesses on the occasion. Consequently &#1488;&#1514; can only express the idea of fellowship here, and &#1512;&#1497;&#1489; &#1488;&#1514; must be distinguished from &#1512;&#1497;&#1489; &#1506;&#1501; in <a href="/micah/6-2.htm">Micah 6:2</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/4-1.htm">Hosea 4:1</a>, etc. The mountains and hills are to hearken to the contest (as in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-1.htm">Deuteronomy 32:1</a> and <a href="/isaiah/1-2.htm">Isaiah 1:2</a>), as witnesses, "who have seen what the Lord has done for Israel throughout the course of ages, and how Israel has rewarded Him for it all" (Caspari), to bear witness on behalf of the Lord, and against Israel. Accordingly the mountains are called &#1492;&#1488;&#1514;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, the constantly enduring, immutable ones, which have been spectators from time immemorial, and &#1502;&#1493;&#1505;&#1491;&#1497; &#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, foundations of the earth, as being subject to no change on account of their strength and firmness. In this respect they are often called "the everlasting mountains" (e.g., <a href="/genesis/49-26.htm">Genesis 49:26</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/33-15.htm">Deuteronomy 33:15</a>; <a href="/psalms/90-2.htm">Psalm 90:2</a>; <a href="/habakkuk/3-6.htm">Habakkuk 3:6</a>). Israel is called &#768;&#8219;amm&#305;&#772; (Jehovah's people) with intentional emphasis, not only to indicate the right of Jehovah to contend with it, but to sharpen its own conscience, by pointing to its calling.
