The sinners to be consumed are, the professed idolaters, and those that worship Jehovah and idols, or swear to the Lord, and to Malcham. Those that think to divide their affections and worship between God and idols, will come short of acceptance with God; for what communion can there be between light and darkness? If Satan have half, he will have all; if the Lord have but half, he will have none. Neglect of God shows impiety and contempt.

The word is not limited to "things" "animate" or "inanimate" or "men;" it is used severally of each, according to the context; here, without limitation, of "all." God and all stand over against one another; God and all which is not of God or in God. God, he says, will utterly consume all from off the land (earth). The prophet sums up in few words the subject of the whole chapter, the judgments of God from his own times to the day of Judgment itself. And this Day Itself he brings the more strongly before the mind, in that, with wonderful briefness, in two words which he conforms, in sound also, the one to the other, he expresses the utter final consumption of all things. He expresses at once the intensity of action and blends their separate meanings, "Taking away I will make an end of all;" and with this he unites the words used of the flood, "from off the face of the earth."<p>Then he goes through the whole creation as it was made, pairing "man and beast," which Moses speaks of as created on the sixth day, and the creation of the fifth day, "the fowls of the heaven and the fishes of the sea;" and before each he sets the solemn word of God, "I will end," as the act of God Himself. The words can have no complete fulfillment, until "the earth and the works that are therein shall be burned up" <a href="//biblehub.com/2_peter/3-10.htm">2 Peter 3:10</a>, as the Psalmist too, having gone through the creation, sums up, "Thou takest away their breath, they die and return to their dust" <a href="/psalms/104-29.htm">Psalm 104:29</a>; and then speaks of the re-creation, "Thou sendest forth Thy Spirit, they are created; and Thou renewest the face of the earth" <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/104-36.htm">Psalm 104:36</a>, and, "Of old Thou hast laid the foundations of the earth, and the heavens are the work of Thy hands; they shall perish, but Thou shalt endure, yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt Thou change them, and they shall be changed" <a href="/psalms/103-25.htm">Psalm 103:25</a>.<p>Local fulfillments there may, in their degree, be. Jerome speaks as if he knew this to have been. Jerome: "Even the brute animals feel the wrath of the Lord, and when cities have been wasted and men slain, there cometh a desolation and scarceness of beasts also and birds and fishes; witness Illyricum, witness Thrace, witness my native soil," (Stridon, a city on the confines of Dalmatia and Pannonia) "where, beside sky and earth and rampant brambles and deep thickets, all has perished." But although this fact, which he alleges, is borne out by natural history, it is distinct from the words of the prophet, who speaks of the fish, not of rivers (as Jerome) but of the sea, which can in no way be influenced by the absence of man, who is only their destroyer. The use of the language of the histories of the creation and of the deluge implies that the prophet has in mind a destruction commensurate with that creation. Then he foretells the final removal of offences, in the same words which our Lord uses of the general Judgment. "The Son of Man shall send forth His Angels and they shall gather out of His kingdom all things that offend, and them that do iniquity" <a href="/matthew/13-41.htm">Matthew 13:41</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/zephaniah/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. utterly consume&#8212;from a root to "sweep away," or "scrape off utterly."

The judgment is indiscriminate, all that lives shall be swept away. Though it is men against whom God’s anger burns, the anger once kindled devours round about and consumes all created things. The sphere of man’s life, the realm of his rule (<a href="/context/psalms/8-6.htm" title="You made him to have dominion over the works of your hands; you have put all things under his feet:...">Psalm 8:6-8</a>), is involved with himself in a common destruction.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/zephaniah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2, 3.</span> - &sect; 2. <span class="accented">The prelude, announcing the judgment upon the whole world.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will utterly consume;</span> literally, <span class="accented">taking away I will make an end.</span> Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/8-13.htm">Jeremiah 8:13</a>)uses the same expression.

"And the remnant of Jacob will be in the midst of many nations like dew from Jehovah, like drops of rain upon grass, which tarrieth not for man, nor waiteth for children of men. <a href="/micah/5-8.htm">Micah 5:8</a>. And the remnant of Jacob will be among the nations, in the midst of many nations, like the lion among the beasts of the forest, like the young lion among the flocks of sheep; which, when it goes through, treads down, and tears in pieces, without deliverer. <a href="/micah/5-9.htm">Micah 5:9</a>. High be thy hand above thine oppressors, and may all thine enemies be rooted out." Two things are predicted here. In the first place (<a href="/micah/5-7.htm">Micah 5:7</a>), Israel will come upon many nations, like a refreshing dew from Jehovah, which falls plentifully in drops upon the grass, and will produce and promote new and vigorous life among them. Dew is here, as indeed everywhere else, a figurative expression for refreshing, stimulating, enlivening (cf. <a href="/psalms/110-3.htm">Psalm 110:3</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/133-3.htm">Psalm 133:3</a>, and <a href="/psalms/72-6.htm">Psalm 72:6</a>; <a href="/hosea/14-6.htm">Hosea 14:6</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/33-2.htm">Deuteronomy 33:2</a>). The spiritual dew, which Jacob will bring to the nations, comes from Jehovah, and falls in rich abundance without the cooperation of men. Without the spiritual dew from above, the nations are grass (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/40-6.htm">Isaiah 40:6-8</a>). &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; before &#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492; does not refer to &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1489;, but to the principal idea of the preceding clause, viz., to &#1496;&#1500;, to which the explanatory &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; is subordinate. As the falling of the dew in rain-drops upon the grass does not depend upon the waiting of men, but proceeds from Jehovah; so will the spiritual blessing, which will flow over from Israel upon the nations, not depend upon the waiting of the nations, but will flow to them against and beyond their expectation. This does not deny the fact that the heathen wait for the salvation of Jehovah, but simply expresses the thought that the blessings will not be measured by their expectation. Secondly (<a href="//biblehub.com/micah/5-8.htm">Micah 5:8</a>, <a href="/micah/5-9.htm">Micah 5:9</a>), the rescued Israel will prove itself a terrible power among the nations, and one to which they will be obliged to succumb. No proof is needed that <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/5-8.htm">Micah 5:8</a>, <a href="/micah/5-9.htm">Micah 5:9</a> do not state in what way Israel will refresh the heathen, as Hitzig supposes. The refreshing dew and the rending lion cannot possibly be synonymous figures. The similarity of the introduction to <a href="/micah/5-7.htm">Micah 5:7</a> and <a href="/micah/5-8.htm">Micah 5:8</a> points of itself to something new. To the nations Christ is set for the rising and falling of many (compare <a href="/luke/2-34.htm">Luke 2:34</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/9-33.htm">Romans 9:33</a>, with <a href="/isaiah/8-14.htm">Isaiah 8:14</a> and <a href="/isaiah/28-16.htm">Isaiah 28:16</a>). The people of God shows itself like a lion, trampling and rending the sheep among the nations of the world which oppose its beneficent work. And over these may it triumph. This wish (ta&#770;ro&#772;m is optative) closes the promise of the attitude which Israel will assume among the nations of the world. For ta&#770;ro&#772;m ya&#770;d (high be the hand), compare <a href="/isaiah/26-11.htm">Isaiah 26:11</a>. High is the hand which accomplishes mighty deeds, which smites and destroys the foe. </body></html>
