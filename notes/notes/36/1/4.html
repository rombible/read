The sinners to be consumed are, the professed idolaters, and those that worship Jehovah and idols, or swear to the Lord, and to Malcham. Those that think to divide their affections and worship between God and idols, will come short of acceptance with God; for what communion can there be between light and darkness? If Satan have half, he will have all; if the Lord have but half, he will have none. Neglect of God shows impiety and contempt.

Judah had gone in the ways of Egypt and learned her sins, and sinned worse than Egypt. "The mighty Hand and stretched-out Arm" <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-10.htm">Jeremiah 2:10-11</a>, with which she had been delivered, shall be again "stretched out," yet, not for her but "upon" her, "upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem." In this threatened destruction of all, Judah and Jerusalem are singled out, because "judgment" shall "begin at the house of God" <a href="/1_peter/4-17.htm">1 Peter 4:17</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/25-29.htm">Jeremiah 25:29</a>. They who have sinned against the greater grace shall be most signally punished. Yet, the punishment of those whom God had so chosen and loved is an earnest of the general judgment. This too is not a partial but a general judgment "upon "all" the inhabitants of Jerusalem."<p>And I will cut off the remnant of Baal - that is, to the very last vestige of it. Isaiah unites "name and residue" <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/14-22.htm">Isaiah 14:22</a>, as equivalents, together with the proverbial, posterity and descendant. Zephaniah distributes them in parallel clauses, "the "residue" of Baal and the "name" of the Chemarim." Good and evil have each a root, which remains in the ground, when the trunk has been hewn down. There is "a remnant according to the election of grace," when "the rest have been blinded" <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/11-5.htm">Romans 11:5</a>, <a href="/romans/11-7.htm">Romans 11:7</a>; and this is a "holy seed" <a href="/isaiah/6-13.htm">Isaiah 6:13</a> to carry on the line of God. Evil too has its remnant, which, unless diligently kept down, shoots up again, after the conversion of peoples or individuals. The "mind of the flesh" remains in the regenerate also. The prophet foretells the complete excision of the whole "remnant of Baal," which was fulfilled in it after the captivity, and shall be fulfilled as to all which it shadows forth, in the Day of Judgment. "From this place;" for in their phrensy, they dared to bring the worship of Baal into the very temple of the Lord <a href="/2_kings/23-4.htm">2 Kings 23:4</a>. Ribera: "Who would ever believe that in Jerusalem, the holy city, and in the very temple idols should be consecrated? Whoso seeth the ways of our times will readily believe it. For among Christians and in the very temple of God, the abominations of the pagan are worshiped. Riches, pleasures, honors, are they not idols which Christians prefer to God Himself?"<p>And the name of the Chemarim with the priests - Of the "idolatrous priests"  the very name shall be cut off, as God promises by Hosea, that He will "take away the names of Baalim" <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/2-17.htm">Hosea 2:17</a>, and by Zechariah, that He "will cut off the names of the idols out of the land" <a href="/zechariah/13-2.htm">Zechariah 13:2</a>. Yet this is more. Not the "name" only "of the Chemarim," but themselves with their name, their posterity, shall be blotted out; still more, it is God who cuts off all memory of them, blotting them out of the book of the living and out of His own.<p>They had but a name before, "that they were living, but were dead" <a href="/revelation/3-1.htm">Revelation 3:1</a>. Jerome: "The Lord shall take away names of vain glory, wrongly admired, out of the Church yea, the very names of the priests with the priests who vainly flatter themselves with the name of Bishops and the dignity of Presbyters without their deeds. Whence he markedly says, not, "and the deeds of priests with the priests," but the "names;" who only bear the false name, of dignities, and with evil works destroy their own names." The "priests are priests of the Lord," who live not like priests, corrupt in life and doctrine and corrupters of God's people (see <a href="/jeremiah/2-8.htm">Jeremiah 2:8</a>;<a href="/jeremiah/5-31.htm">Jeremiah 5:31</a>). The judgment is pronounced alike on what was intrinsically evil, and on good which had corrupted itself into evil. The title of priest is no where given to the priest of a false God, without some mention in the context, implying that they were idolatrous priests; as the priests of Dagon <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/5-5.htm">1 Samuel 5:5</a>, of the high places as ordained by Jeroboam <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/13-2.htm">1 Kings 13:2</a>, <a href="/1_kings/13-33.htm">1 Kings 13:33</a>; <a href="/2_kings/23-20.htm">2 Kings 23:20</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-15.htm">2 Chronicles 11:15</a>, of Baal <a href="/2_kings/10-19.htm">2 Kings 10:19</a>; <a href="/2_kings/11-18.htm">2 Kings 11:18</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/23-17.htm">2 Chronicles 23:17</a>, of Bethel <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/7-10.htm">Amos 7:10</a>, of Ahab <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/10-11.htm">2 Kings 10:11</a>, of those who were not gods <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-9.htm">2 Chronicles 13:9</a>, of On, where the sun was worshiped . "The priests" then were God's priests, who in the evil days of Manasseh had manifoldly corrupted their life or their faith, and who were still evil.<p>The "priests" of Judah, with its kings its princes and the people of the land, were in Jeremiah's inaugural vision enumerated as those, who "shall," God says, "fight against thee, but shall not prevail against thee" <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-18.htm">Jeremiah 1:18-19</a>. "The priests said not, Where is the Lord? and they that handle the law knew Me not" <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-7.htm">Jeremiah 2:7-8</a>. In the general corruption, "A wonderful and horrible thing is committed in the land, the prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule at their hands" <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-30.htm">Jeremiah 5:30-31</a> : "the children of Israel and the children of Judah, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets, and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, have turned unto Me the back, and not the face" <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-32.htm">Jeremiah 32:32-33</a>. Jeremiah speaks specifically of heavy moral sins.

Josiah is expressly said (2Ki 23:5, Margin) to have "put down the Chemarim."

Hillerus (k) thinks they are the same with those heathen priests called "Phallophori"; deriving the word from one in the Arabic language, which has the signification of the "Phalli"; which were obscene images, carried about in an impudent manner by the priests of Bacchus, in the performance of his sacred rites: the carrying of them was first instituted by Isis, as Plutarch (l) says; and if this was the case here, it is no wonder they should be so severely threatened. Some take them to be a sort of servants or ministers to the priests of Baal, who waited on them at the time of service; and so are distinguished from them in this clause, taking the word "priests" in it to design the priests of Baal; and the Vulgate Latin version renders it, "the name of sextons with the priests". The word is used now by the Jews for Popish monks that live in cloisters; and Elias Levita (m) thinks these here are so called from their living in such like recluse places. The Targum is, <p>"and the name of their worshippers with their priests;'' <p>one and the other; priests of Baal, and apostate priests of the Lord; the worshippers of Baal, and those that attend upon his priests, shall all feel the weight of Jehovah's hand, and the lighting down of his arm with indignation. <p>(k) Onomastic.

The prophet turns to Judah and Jerusalem. Though the Day of the Lord was the revelation of Jehovah to the world, and therefore a thing universal, the centre of the judgment in the view of the pre-exile prophets was Israel (Amos 1, 2; Isaiah 2, 3), for judgment began at the house of God (<a href="/amos/3-2.htm" title="You only have I known of all the families of the earth: therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities.">Amos 3:2</a>). With the exile the judgment on Israel seemed to have been fulfilled, and during the exile and later the judgment of the Day of the Lord is represented as falling on the heathen world (Isaiah 13; Zechariah 1-6), and its issue is Israel’s redemption. But after the Restoration, when Israel was again a people and far from answering to its ideal, prophets have to threaten it anew with the refiner’s fire of the Day of the Lord (<a href="/malachi/3-2.htm" title="But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he appears? for he is like a refiner's fire, and like fullers' soap:">Malachi 3:2</a> ff.).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">I will also stretch</span>] <span class="bld">And I will stretch out my hand</span>, i.e. in order to smite, <a href="/isaiah/5-25.htm" title="Therefore is the anger of the LORD kindled against his people, and he has stretched forth his hand against them, and has smitten them: and the hills did tremble, and their carcasses were torn in the middle of the streets.

The term <span class="ital">Baal</span> appears to he used, particularly in later writers, not only of Baal proper, but also of the images of Jehovah, and even in a wider way of Jehovah under any false conception of His being. Worship rendered nominally to Jehovah, but unworthy of Him, and implying an inadequate conception of His nature, was stigmatised as Baal-worship. The expression <span class="ital">the remnant</span>, besides its natural sense of “that which is left,” may mean “the whole,” so that “remnant of Baal” may have the sense of “false worship wholly” (<a href="/isaiah/14-22.htm" title="For I will rise up against them, said the LORD of hosts, and cut off from Babylon the name, and remnant, and son, and nephew, said the LORD.">Isaiah 14:22</a>), and this is probably the meaning here. For “remnant” Sept. gives <span class="ital">names</span> of Baal, a rendering which may be due to the influence of <a href="/hosea/2-17.htm" title="For I will take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth, and they shall no more be remembered by their name.">Hosea 2:17</a>, “I will take away the names of the Baalim out of her mouth.” Cf. <a href="/zechariah/13-2.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in that day, said the LORD of hosts, that I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land, and they shall no more be remembered: and also I will cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the land.">Zechariah 13:2</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the name of the Chemarims</span>] The A.V. plur. Chemarims is of the same sort as Cherubims (<a href="/genesis/3-24.htm" title="So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubim, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.">Genesis 3:24</a>) and Seraphims (<a href="/isaiah/6-2.htm" title="Above it stood the seraphim: each one had six wings; with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he did fly.">Isaiah 6:2</a>); in Heb. the word Chemarim (pronounced Kemârim) is itself a plural. The term is derived from an Aramaic root, meaning “to be black,” but whether the priests were so named as “black-robed” or for some other reason is not certain. In addition to the present passage the word is used in <a href="/hosea/10-5.htm" title="The inhabitants of Samaria shall fear because of the calves of Bethaven: for the people thereof shall mourn over it, and the priests thereof that rejoiced on it, for the glory thereof, because it is departed from it.">Hosea 10:5</a> of the priests of the calves in the northern kingdom, and in <a href="/2_kings/23-5.htm" title="And he put down the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of Judah, and in the places round about Jerusalem; them also that burned incense to Baal, to the sun, and to the moon, and to the planets, and to all the host of heaven.">2 Kings 23:5</a> of the priests of the high places in the cities of Judah and outside Jerusalem (A.V. <span class="ital">idolatrous priests</span>). In the latter passage the construction leaves it somewhat uncertain whether the strictly idolatrous priests who offered sacrifice to Baal, the sun and the moon, be also included among the Chemarim. In <a href="/hosea/10-5.htm" title="The inhabitants of Samaria shall fear because of the calves of Bethaven: for the people thereof shall mourn over it, and the priests thereof that rejoiced on it, for the glory thereof, because it is departed from it.">Hosea 10:5</a> the Sept. does not read the word, and in <a href="/2_kings/23-5.htm" title="And he put down the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of Judah, and in the places round about Jerusalem; them also that burned incense to Baal, to the sun, and to the moon, and to the planets, and to all the host of heaven.">2 Kings 23:5</a> it merely transcribes the name in Greek letters.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">with the priests</span>] The clause is wanting in Sept., and may be a later addition. The view of Keil that “the priests” are the strictly idolatrous priests who sacrificed to Baal and other deities, while the Chemarim are the priests of the high places, has little probability; in such a case the term “priests” would have been more fully defined. Whether the clause be a gloss or not, the “priests” are probably the degenerate regular priests of Jehovah, such as are described in ch. <a href="/zephaniah/3-4.htm" title="Her prophets are light and treacherous persons: her priests have polluted the sanctuary, they have done violence to the law.">Zephaniah 3:4</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/zephaniah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4-6.</span> - &sect; 3. <span class="accented">The judgment will fall especially upon Judah and Jerusalem for their idolatry.</span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/micah/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>But the Messiah will prove Himself to be peace to His people, not only by the fact that He protects and saves it from the attacks of the imperial power represented by Asshur, but also by the fact that He endows His rescuing people with the power to overcome their enemies, both spiritually and bodily also. <a href="/micah/5-7.htm">Micah 5:7</a>. "And the remnant of Jacob will be in the midst of many nations like dew from Jehovah, like drops of rain upon grass, which tarrieth not for man, nor waiteth for children of men. <a href="/micah/5-8.htm">Micah 5:8</a>. And the remnant of Jacob will be among the nations, in the midst of many nations, like the lion among the beasts of the forest, like the young lion among the flocks of sheep; which, when it goes through, treads down, and tears in pieces, without deliverer. <a href="/micah/5-9.htm">Micah 5:9</a>. High be thy hand above thine oppressors, and may all thine enemies be rooted out." Two things are predicted here. In the first place (<a href="/micah/5-7.htm">Micah 5:7</a>), Israel will come upon many nations, like a refreshing dew from Jehovah, which falls plentifully in drops upon the grass, and will produce and promote new and vigorous life among them. Dew is here, as indeed everywhere else, a figurative expression for refreshing, stimulating, enlivening (cf. <a href="/psalms/110-3.htm">Psalm 110:3</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/133-3.htm">Psalm 133:3</a>, and <a href="/psalms/72-6.htm">Psalm 72:6</a>; <a href="/hosea/14-6.htm">Hosea 14:6</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/33-2.htm">Deuteronomy 33:2</a>). The spiritual dew, which Jacob will bring to the nations, comes from Jehovah, and falls in rich abundance without the cooperation of men. Without the spiritual dew from above, the nations are grass (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/40-6.htm">Isaiah 40:6-8</a>). &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; before &#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492; does not refer to &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1489;, but to the principal idea of the preceding clause, viz., to &#1496;&#1500;, to which the explanatory &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; is subordinate. As the falling of the dew in rain-drops upon the grass does not depend upon the waiting of men, but proceeds from Jehovah; so will the spiritual blessing, which will flow over from Israel upon the nations, not depend upon the waiting of the nations, but will flow to them against and beyond their expectation. This does not deny the fact that the heathen wait for the salvation of Jehovah, but simply expresses the thought that the blessings will not be measured by their expectation. Secondly (<a href="//biblehub.com/micah/5-8.htm">Micah 5:8</a>, <a href="/micah/5-9.htm">Micah 5:9</a>), the rescued Israel will prove itself a terrible power among the nations, and one to which they will be obliged to succumb. No proof is needed that <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/5-8.htm">Micah 5:8</a>, <a href="/micah/5-9.htm">Micah 5:9</a> do not state in what way Israel will refresh the heathen, as Hitzig supposes. The refreshing dew and the rending lion cannot possibly be synonymous figures. The similarity of the introduction to <a href="/micah/5-7.htm">Micah 5:7</a> and <a href="/micah/5-8.htm">Micah 5:8</a> points of itself to something new. To the nations Christ is set for the rising and falling of many (compare <a href="/luke/2-34.htm">Luke 2:34</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/9-33.htm">Romans 9:33</a>, with <a href="/isaiah/8-14.htm">Isaiah 8:14</a> and <a href="/isaiah/28-16.htm">Isaiah 28:16</a>). The people of God shows itself like a lion, trampling and rending the sheep among the nations of the world which oppose its beneficent work. And over these may it triumph. This wish (ta&#770;ro&#772;m is optative) closes the promise of the attitude which Israel will assume among the nations of the world. For ta&#770;ro&#772;m ya&#770;d (high be the hand), compare <a href="/isaiah/26-11.htm">Isaiah 26:11</a>. High is the hand which accomplishes mighty deeds, which smites and destroys the foe. </body></html>
