The servants of God all proclaim, There is no peace for the wicked. The expressions are figurative, speaking every where desolation; the land shall be left without inhabitants. The sinners to be consumed are, the professed idolaters, and those that worship Jehovah and idols, or swear to the Lord, and to Malcham. Those that think to divide their affections and worship between God and idols, will come short of acceptance with God; for what communion can there be between light and darkness? If Satan have half, he will have all; if the Lord have but half, he will have none. Neglect of God shows impiety and contempt. May none of us be among those who draw back unto perdition, but of those who believe to the saving of the soul.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/zephaniah/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And them that worship the best of heaven upon the - (flat) housetops This was fulfilled by Josiah who destroyed "the altars that were on the top of the upper chamber of Ahaz" <a href="/2_kings/23-12.htm">2 Kings 23:12</a>. Jeremiah speaks as if this worship was almost universal, as though well-near every roof had been profaned by this idolatry. "The houses of Jerusalem, and the houses of Judah, shall be defiled as the place of Tophet, because of all the houses upon whose roofs they have burned incense unto all the host of heaven, and have poured out drink-offerings unto other gods" <a href="/jeremiah/19-13.htm">Jeremiah 19:13</a>. "The Chaldaeans that fight against this city, shall come and set fire on this city, and burn it with the houses, upon whose roofs they have offered incense unto Baal, and poured out drink-offerings to other gods, to provoke Me to anger" <a href="/jeremiah/32-29.htm">Jeremiah 32:29</a>. They worshiped on the house-tops, probably to have a clearer view of that magnificent expanse of sky, "the moon and stars which" God had "ordained" <a href="/psalms/8-3.htm">Psalm 8:3</a>; the "queen of heaven," which they worshiped instead of Himself. There is something so mysterious in that calm face of the moon, as it "walketh in beauty" <a href="/job/31-26.htm">Job 31:26</a>; God seems to have invested it with such delegated influence over the seasons and the produce of the earth, that they stopped short in it, and worshiped the creature rather than the Creator. Much as men now talk of "Nature," admire "Nature," speak of its "laws," not as laws imposed upon it, but inherent in it, laws affecting us and our well-being; only not in their ever-varying vicissitudes, "doing whatsoever God commandeth them upon the face of the world in the earth, whether for correction, or for His land or for mercy!" <a href="//biblehub.com/job/37-12.htm">Job 37:12-13</a>. The idolaters "worshiped and served the creature more than the Creator, Who is blessed forever" <a href="/romans/1-25.htm">Romans 1:25</a>; moderns equally make this world their object, only they idolize themselves and their discoveries, and worship their own intellect.<p>This worship on the house-tops individualized the public idolatry; it was a rebellion against God, family by family; a sort of family-prayer of idolatry. "Did we," say the mingled multitude to Jeremiah, "make our cakes to worship her, and pour out our drink-offerings unto her, without our men?" <a href="/jeremiah/44-19.htm">Jeremiah 44:19</a>. Its family character is described in Jeremiah. "The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead the dough to make cakes to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink-offerings unto other gods" <a href="/jeremiah/7-18.htm">Jeremiah 7:18</a>. The idolatry spread to other cities. "We will certainly do," they say, "as we have done, we and our fathers, our kings and our princes, in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem" <a href="/jeremiah/44-17.htm">Jeremiah 44:17</a>. The incense went up continually "as a memorial to God" from the altar of incense in the temple: the "roofs of the houses" were so many altars, from which, street by street and house by house the incense went up to her, for whom they dethroned God, "the queen of heaven." It was an idolatry, with which Judah was especially besotted, believing that they received all goods of this world from them and not from God. When punished for their sin, they repented of their partial repentance and maintained to Jeremiah that they were punished for "leaving off to burn incense to the queen of heaven" <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-2.htm">Jeremiah 44:2</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-15.htm">Jeremiah 44:15</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/44-18.htm">Jeremiah 44:18</a>.<p>And them that worship ... the Lord - but with a divided heart and service; "that swear by (rather  to) the Lord," swear fealty and loyal allegiance to Him, while they do acts which deny it, in that "they swear by Malcham," better (it is no appellative although allied to one) "their king" , most probably, I think, "Moloch."<p>This idolatry had been their enduring idolatry in the wilderness, after the calves had been annihilated; it is "the" worship, against which Israel is warned by name in the law <a href="/leviticus/18-21.htm">Leviticus 18:21</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/20-2.htm">Leviticus 20:2-4</a>; then, throughout the history of the Judges, we hear of the kindred idolatry of Baal , "the" Lord (who was called also  "eternal king" and from whom individuals named themselves "son of (the) king," "servant of (the) king" ), or the manifold Baals  and Ashtaroth or Astarte. But after these had been removed on the preaching of Samuel <a href="/1_samuel/7-6.htm">1 Samuel 7:6</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-10.htm">1 Samuel 12:10</a>, this idolatry does not reappear in Judah until the intermarriage of Jehoram with the house of Ahab <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/8-16.htm">2 Kings 8:16-18</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/8-26.htm">2 Kings 8:26-27</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-6.htm">2 Chronicles 21:6</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-12.htm">2 Chronicles 21:12-13</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/22-2.htm">2 Chronicles 22:2-4</a>.<p>The kindred and equally horrible worship of "Molech, the abomination of the children of Ammon" <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/11-7.htm">1 Kings 11:7</a>, was brought in by Solomon in his decay, and endured until his high place was defiled by Josiah <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/23-13.htm">2 Kings 23:13-14</a>. It is probable then that this was "their king" , of whom Zephaniah speaks, whom Amos  and after him Jeremiah, called "their king;" but speaking of Ammon. Him, the king of Ammon, Judah adopted as "their king." They owned God as their king in words; Molech they owned by their deeds; "they worshiped and sware fealty to the Lord" and they "sware by their king;" his name was familiarly in their mouths; to him they appealed as the Judge and witness of the truth of their words, his displeasure they invoked on themselves, if they swore falsely. Cyril: "Those in error were wont to swear by heaven, and, as matter of reverence to call out, 'By the king and lord Sun.' Those who do so must of set purpose and willfully depart from the love of God, since the law expressly says, "Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and serve Him alone, and swear by His Name" <a href="/deuteronomy/6-13.htm">Deuteronomy 6:13</a>.<p>The former class who "worshipped on the roofs" were mere idolaters. These "worshiped," as they thought, "the Lord," bound themselves solemnly by oath to Him, but with a reserve, joining a hateful idol to Him, in that they, by a religious act, owned it too as god. The act which they did was in direct words, or by implication, forbidden by God. The command to "swear by the Lord" implied that they were to swear by none else. It was followed by the prohibition to go after other gods. (<a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-13.htm">Deuteronomy 6:13-14</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-30.htm">Deuteronomy 10:30</a>, compare <a href="/isaiah/65-16.htm">Isaiah 65:16</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/4-2.htm">Jeremiah 4:2</a>). Contrariwise, to swear by other gods was forbidden as a part of their service. "Be very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the Law of Moses, neither make mention of the name of their gods, nor cause to swear by them, neither serve them, but cleave unto the Lord your God" (<a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/23-6.htm">Joshua 23:6-8</a>; compare <a href="/amos/8-14.htm">Amos 8:14</a>). "How shall I pardon thee for this? Thy children have forsaken Me, and have sworn by those who are no gods" <a href="/jeremiah/5-7.htm">Jeremiah 5:7</a>. "They taught My people to swear by Baal" <a href="/jeremiah/12-16.htm">Jeremiah 12:16</a>. They thought perhaps that in that they professed to serve God, did the greater homage to Him, professed and bound themselves to be His, (such is the meaning of "swear to the Lord") they might, without renouncing His service, do certain things, "swear by their king," although in effect they thereby owned hint also as god. To such Elijah said, "How long halt ye between two opinions? If the Lord be God, follow Him; but if Baal, then follow him" <a href="/1_kings/18-21.htm">1 Kings 18:21</a>; and God by Jeremiah rejects with abhorrence such divided service. "Ye trust in lying words, which will not profit. Will ye steal, murder, commit adultery, swear falsely, and burn incense unto Baal, and walk after other gods, and come and stand before Me in this house, which is called by My name, saying, We are delivered to do all these abominations" <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-8.htm">Jeremiah 7:8-10</a>. And Hosea, "Neither go ye to Beth-aven, and swear there, The Lord liveth" <a href="/hosea/4-15.htm">Hosea 4:15</a>.<p>Such are Christians, Jerome: "who think that they can serve together the world and the Lord, and please two masters, God and Mammom; who, "being soldiers of Jesus Christ" and having sworn fealty to Him, "entangle themselves with the affairs of this life and offer the same image to God and to Caesar" <a href="//biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-3.htm">2 Timothy 2:3-4</a>. To such, God, whom with their lips they own, is not their God; their idol is, as the very name says, "their king," whom alone they please, displeasing and dishonoring God. We must not only fear, love, honor God, but love, fear, honor all beside for Him Alone. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/zephaniah/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. worship the host of heaven&#8212;Saba: whence, in contrast to Sabeanism, Jehovah is called Lord of Sabaoth.<p>upon the housetops&#8212;which were flat (2Ki 23:5, 6, 12; Jer 19:13; 32:29).<p>swear by the Lord&#8212;rather, "swear to Jehovah" (2Ch 15:14); solemnly dedicating themselves to Him (compare Isa 48:1; Ho 4:15).<p>and&#8212;"and yet (with strange inconsistency, 1Ki 18:21; Eze 20:39; Mt 6:24) swear by Malcham," that is, "their king" [Maurer]: the same as Molech (see on [1167]Am 5:25), and "Milcom the god of &#8230; Ammon" (1Ki 11:33).

These were such as partly worshipped God, and partly idols; they divided their religion and devotion between them, sometimes served the one, and sometimes the other; they halted between two opinions, and were a sort of occasional conformists; and such were as detestable to God as those that worshipped idols; as the Papists are, who pretend to worship God and their images, or God in them, and with them; and so all such persons that seek for justification and salvation, partly by their own works, and partly by Christ, are displeasing to the Lord, and miss of the thing; stumbling at the stumbling stone, and so fall and perish. <p>(n)  "qui jurant Domino", Drusius; "qui jurant Jehovae", Cocceius; "jurantes Domino Jehovae", Burkius. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/zephaniah/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And them that worship the host of heaven upon the housetops; and them that worship <i>and</i> that swear by the LORD, and that swear by <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> Malcham;</span><p>(c) He alludes to their idol Molech, which was forbidden; read Le 20:2, yet they called him their king, and made him as a god: therefore he here notes those that will both say they worship God, and yet will swear by idols and serve them: which faltering is here condemned, as in Eze 20:39, 1Ki 18:21, 2Ki 17:33.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/zephaniah/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5</span>. Besides the priests who lead the false worship, the various classes of worshippers shall be swept away: (1) those that worship the host of heaven on the house-tops; (2) those who unite Jehovah and other gods in their worship; and (3) those who have renounced the service of Jehovah, or who do not concern themselves about Him (<span class="ital"><a href="/zephaniah/1-6.htm" title="And them that are turned back from the LORD; and those that have not sought the LORD, nor inquired for him.">Zephaniah 1:6</a></span>)—those wholly indifferent, “settled on their lees” (<span class="ital"><a href="/zephaniah/1-12.htm" title="And it shall come to pass at that time, that I will search Jerusalem with candles, and punish the men that are settled on their lees: that say in their heart, The LORD will not do good, neither will he do evil.">Zephaniah 1:12</a></span>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the host of heaven</span>] The “host of heaven” appears to be an expression including the heavenly bodies in general, sun, moon and stars. Of course only particular stars, such as the more brilliant fixed stars and the planets, with the constellations of the zodiac (<a href="/2_kings/23-5.htm" title="And he put down the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of Judah, and in the places round about Jerusalem; them also that burned incense to Baal, to the sun, and to the moon, and to the planets, and to all the host of heaven.">2 Kings 23:5</a>), would be worshipped, not the starry heavens in a mass. The sun and moon are frequently specified separately from the “host of heaven,” because more conspicuous, though they are no doubt to be included in the general expression, “host of heaven.” The fact that the worship of the heavenly bodies was performed on the housetops indicates that the service was rendered directly to them when visible and not indirectly to representations of them. <a href="/job/31-26.htm" title="If I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking in brightness;">Job 31:26</a> describes one way of performing the worship: “If I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking in brightness, and my heart hath been secretly enticed, and my mouth hath kissed my hand”; cf. <a href="/ezekiel/8-16.htm" title="And he brought me into the inner court of the LORD's house, and, behold, at the door of the temple of the LORD, between the porch and the altar, were about five and twenty men, with their backs toward the temple of the LORD, and their faces toward the east; and they worshipped the sun toward the east.">Ezekiel 8:16</a>, “Behold, about five and twenty men, with their backs toward the temple of the Lord, and their faces toward the east; and they worshipped the sun toward the east.” Worship of the host of heaven is not alluded to by the prophets of northern Israel, unless it be in the obscure passage <a href="/amos/5-26.htm" title="But you have borne the tabernacle of your Moloch and Chiun your images, the star of your god, which you made to yourselves.">Amos 5:26</a>. Its prevalence in Judah in later times was due to the influence of Assyria. It was natural that the vassal state should imitate the manners and religion of its superior. The practice appears to have been introduced by Ahaz (<a href="/2_kings/23-12.htm" title="And the altars that were on the top of the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the LORD, did the king beat down, and broke them down from there, and cast the dust of them into the brook Kidron.">2 Kings 23:12</a>), and is frequently alluded to by Jeremiah and writers after his time (<a href="/jeremiah/19-13.htm" title="And the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses of the kings of Judah, shall be defiled as the place of Tophet, because of all the houses on whose roofs they have burned incense to all the host of heaven, and have poured out drink offerings to other gods.">Jeremiah 19:13</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that swear by the Lord</span>] lit. <span class="ital">that swear to</span> the Lord. To swear <span class="ital">to</span> the Lord is to acknowledge and do homage to Jehovah as God; to swear <span class="ital">by</span> the Lord is to bind oneself by His name in taking an oath. Cf. <a href="/isaiah/45-23.htm" title="I have sworn by myself, the word is gone out of my mouth in righteousness, and shall not return, That to me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear.">Isaiah 45:23</a>, “<span class="ital">unto</span> me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">And that swear by Malcham</span>] The word <span class="ital">Malcham</span> as pointed means <span class="ital">their King</span>, that is, probably Molech. Others would point <span class="ital">Milcom</span>, the name of the god of the children of Ammon (<a href="/1_kings/11-5.htm" title="For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.">1 Kings 11:5</a>; <a href="/1_kings/11-33.htm" title="Because that they have forsaken me, and have worshipped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, Chemosh the god of the Moabites, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon, and have not walked in my ways, to do that which is right in my eyes, and to keep my statutes and my judgments, as did David his father.">1 Kings 11:33</a>; <a href="/2_kings/23-13.htm" title="And the high places that were before Jerusalem, which were on the right hand of the mount of corruption, which Solomon the king of Israel had built for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Zidonians, and for Chemosh the abomination of the Moabites, and for Milcom the abomination of the children of Ammon, did the king defile.">2 Kings 23:13</a>), who however is called Molech in <a href="/1_kings/11-7.htm" title="Then did Solomon build an high place for Chemosh, the abomination of Moab, in the hill that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech, the abomination of the children of Ammon.">1 Kings 11:7</a>. Though Solomon to gratify his strange wives built highplaces to Milcom and other gods, worship of the Ammonitish Milcom in Israel is nowhere else alluded to and has little probability. The spelling Malcham, “their King,” is therefore preferable, though it is possible that Malcham is merely another pronunciation of Milcom, meaning Molech. The vowels in the word <span class="ital">Mólech</span> are altogether anomalous, and are possibly those of the word <span class="ital">shame</span> (bósheth), i.e. Baal; the word should in all likelihood be spelled Mélech (or Malich), the ordinary word for “King,” as in <a href="/isaiah/57-9.htm" title="And you went to the king with ointment, and did increase your perfumes, and did send your messengers far off, and did debase yourself even to hell.">Isaiah 57:9</a>.

Two classes of persons cannot be meant: viz., such as worship and swear to Jehovah and such as swear by their King.

Ezekiel refers to such persons, ch. <a href="/ezekiel/23-37.htm" title="That they have committed adultery, and blood is in their hands, and with their idols have they committed adultery, and have also caused their sons, whom they bore to me, to pass for them through the fire, to devour them.">Ezekiel 23:37</a> ff., “For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it” (<span class="ital"><a href="/ezekiel/23-39.htm" title="For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it; and, see, thus have they done in the middle of my house.">Ezekiel 23:39</a></span>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/zephaniah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will also stretch out mine hand</span>. This expression is used when God is about to do great things or inflict notable punishment (see <a href="/exodus/3-20.htm">Exodus 3:20</a>; <a href="/exodus/15-12.htm">Exodus 15:12</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/4-34.htm">Deuteronomy 4:34</a>; <a href="/isaiah/5-25.htm">Isaiah 5:25</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/51-25.htm">Jeremiah 51:25</a>, etc.). Judah. In so far as Judah was rebellious and wicked, it should incur the judicial punishment. Judgment was to begin at the house of God (<a href="/1_peter/4-17.htm">1 Peter 4:17</a>), the sin of the chosen people being more heinous than  that of heathens. Hence it is added, <span class="cmt_word">upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem,</span> because, having in their very midst the temple of God, with its services and priests, they ought especially to have abhorred idolatry and maintained the true faith. <span class="cmt_word">The remnant of Baal;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the last vestige. One cannot argue from this expression that the reform was already carried so far that Baal worship had almost disappeared. The next verse shows that idolatry still flourished; but the term implies merely that God would exterminate it so entirely that no trace of it should remain. The LXX. has, "the names of Baal," <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x392;&#x1f71;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;</span> (<a href="/hosea/2-17.htm">Hosea 2:17</a>).

The word means "black-robed," and is applied to the idolatrous priests whom the kings had appointed to conduct worship in high places (<a href="/2_kings/23-5.htm">2 Kings 23:5</a>; <a href="/hosea/10-5.htm">Hosea 10:5</a>). "The name," says Dr. Pussy, "is probably the Syriac name of 'priest,' used in Holy Scripture of idolatrous priests, because the Syrians were idolaters" Not only shall the persons of these priests be cut off, but their very name and memory shall vanish (<a href="/zechariah/13-2.htm">Zechariah 13:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">With the priests</span> (<span class="accented">kohanim</span>). Together with the legitimate priests who had corrupted the worship of Jehovah (<a href="/zephaniah/3-4.htm">Zephaniah 3:4</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/2-8.htm">Jeremiah 2:8</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/8-11.htm">Ezekiel 8:11</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That worship the host of heaven upon the house tops.</span> In this verse two classes of fame worshippers are mentioned, viz. star worshippers, and waverers. The worship of the sun, moon, and stars was a very ancient form of error, the heavenly bodies being regarded as the representatives of the powers of nature and the originators of events on earth (see <a href="/deuteronomy/4-19.htm">Deuteronomy 4:19</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/17-3.htm">Deuteronomy 17:3</a>; <a href="/job/31-26.htm">Job 31:26, 27</a>; <a href="/2_kings/17-16.htm">2 Kings 17:16</a>). It was especially prevalent in the time of Manasseh (<a href="/2_kings/21-3.htm">2 Kings 21:3</a>), On the flat roofs of the houses, which were used as places of meditation, recreation, or conference (comp. <a href="/joshua/2-6.htm">Joshua 2:6</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/9-25.htm">1 Samuel 9:25</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/11-2.htm">2 Samuel 11:2</a>; <a href="/acts/10-9.htm">Acts 10:9</a>), they erected altars for family worship of the heavenly bodies. Here they both burned incense (<a href="/jeremiah/19-13.htm">Jeremiah 19:13</a>) and offered animal sacrifices (<a href="/2_kings/23-12.htm">2 Kings 23:12</a>). "In Syrian cities," says Dr. Thomson, "the roofs are a great comfort. The ordinary houses have no other place where the inmates, can either see the sun, smell the air, dry their clothes, set out their flower pots, or do numberless other things essential to their health and comfort. During a large part of the year the roof is the most agreeable place about the establishment, especially in the morning and evening. There multitudes sleep during the summer" ('The Land and the Book,' p. 39). <span class="cmt_word">Them that worship and that,</span> etc.; rather, <span class="accented">the worshippers who</span>, etc. These were people who endeavoured to blend the worship of God with that of Baal, or halted between two opinions (<a href="/1_kings/18-21.htm">1 Kings 18:21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Swear by the Lord;</span> rather, swear to the <span class="accented">Lord</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> bind themselves by oath to him, and at the same time <span class="cmt_word">swear by Malcham;</span> <span class="accented">swear by their king</span>, Baal, or Moloch; call upon him as god. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, "by their king." But it is, perhaps, best to retain the name untranslated, in which ease it would be the appellation of the god Moloch, who could hardly be omitted in enumerating the objects of idolatrous worship (see <a href="/jeremiah/49-1.htm">Jeremiah 49:1, 3</a>; and notes on Amos 1:15; 5:26). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/micah/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>But if Israel conquer the nations in such a way as this, then will Jehovah fulfil the peace of His people by the destruction of all the instruments of war, and the extermination of everything of an idolatrous nature, as well as by the judgment of wrath upon all resisting nations. <a href="/micah/5-10.htm">Micah 5:10</a>. "And it comes to pass in that day, is the saying of Jehovah, that I will destroy thy horses out of the midst of thee, and annihilate thy chariots. <a href="/micah/5-11.htm">Micah 5:11</a>. And I shall destroy the cities of thy land, and throw down all thy fortresses. <a href="/micah/5-12.htm">Micah 5:12</a>. And I shall destroy the witchcrafts out of thy hand; and cloud-interpreters shall not be left to thee. <a href="/micah/5-13.htm">Micah 5:13</a>. And I shall destroy thy graven images and thy statutes out of the midst of thee; and thou wilt no more worship the work of thy hands. <a href="/micah/5-14.htm">Micah 5:14</a>. And I shall root out thine idol-groves out of the midst of thee, and destroy thy cities. <a href="/micah/5-15.htm">Micah 5:15</a>. And I shall execute vengeance in wrath and fury upon the nations which have not heard." These verses do not explain <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/5-8.htm">Micah 5:8</a>, or state how the extermination of the enemy is to take place, or how Israel is made into a lion destroying the nations that are hostile to it, namely, by the fact that the Lord eradicates from its heart all confidence in horses, chariots, and fortifications, in witchcraft and idolatry (Caspari). This assumption is at variance with the words themselves, and with the strophic arrangement of the chapter. There is nothing about trust in horses, etc., but simply about the extermination of the horses, and everything else in which the idolatrous nation had sought its strength. Moreover, the expression &#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492; &#1489;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1501; &#1492;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;, when compared with &#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492; in <a href="/micah/5-4.htm">Micah 5:4</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/5-6.htm">Micah 5:6</a>, shows at once that these verses are intended to depict the last and greatest effect produced by the coming of the Prince of peace in Israel, and overthrows Hengstenberg's assumption, that the prophet here foretels the destructive work of the Lord in Israel, which will precede the destruction of the enemy predicted in <a href="/micah/5-10.htm">Micah 5:10</a>. In that case &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1501; &#1492;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; would mean "before that day," a meaning which it can never have. The prophet passes rather from the attitude of Israel among the nations, to the description of the internal perfection of the kingdom of God, which does indeed stand in a reciprocal relation to the former and proceed simultaneously with it, but which will not be completed till after the victorious suppression of the foe. Only when the people of God shall have gained the supremacy over all their enemies, will the time have arrived for all the instruments of war to be destroyed. When the world shall be overcome, then will all war cease. The ancient Israel did indeed put its trust in war-horses, and war-chariots, and fortifications (cf. <a href="/isaiah/2-7.htm">Isaiah 2:7</a>); but the Messianic Israel, or the true people of the Lord, will only put its trust in such things so far as it is not yet pervaded by the power of the peace brought by the Messiah. And the more it appropriates the spiritual power of the Prince of peace, the more will the trust in horses and chariots disappear; so that they will be destroyed, because all war comes to an end (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/9-4.htm">Isaiah 9:4-6</a>). And the extermination of everything of an idolatrous nature will go hand in hand with this. Two kinds are mentioned in <a href="/micah/5-12.htm">Micah 5:12</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/5-13.htm">Micah 5:13</a>, viz., witchcraft and the worship of idols of their own making. As objects of witchcraft there are mentioned kesha&#770;ph&#305;&#772;m, lit., witchcrafts of different kinds, but the expression &#1502;&#1497;&#1468;&#1491;&#1498; limits them to such as are performed with the hand, and me&#8219;o&#772;nen&#305;&#772;m ( equals  &#8219;o&#772;nen&#305;&#772;m in <a href="/isaiah/2-6.htm">Isaiah 2:6</a>), lit., cloud-interpreters, or cloud, i.e., storm makers, from &#8219;a&#770;nan, a kind of witchcraft which cannot be more precisely defined (see Delitzsch on Isaiah, l.c.). Of the objects of the idolatrous worship there are mentioned (after <a href="/leviticus/26-1.htm">Leviticus 26:1</a>) pes&#305;&#772;l&#305;&#772;m, idols made of wood or metal; and &#1502;&#1510;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;, stone-images, or stones dedicated to idols (see at <a href="/1_kings/14-23.htm">1 Kings 14:23</a>).
