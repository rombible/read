This day of the Lord is very near; it is a day of God's wrath, wrath to the utmost. It will be a day of trouble and distress to sinners. Let them not be laid asleep by the patience of God. What is a man profited if he gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? And what shall a man give in exchange for his soul? Let us flee from the wrath to come, and choose the good part that shall never be taken from us; then we shall be prepared for every event; nothing shall separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/zephaniah/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them in the day of the Lord's wrath - Gain unjustly gotten was the cause of their destruction. For, as Ezekiel closes the like description; "They shall cast their silver into the streets, and their gold shall be removed; their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the Lord; they shall not satisfy their souls nor fill their bowels: "because it is the stumbling-block of their iniquity" <a href="/ezekiel/7-19.htm">Ezekiel 7:19</a>. Much less shall any possession, outward or inward, be of avail in the Great Day; since in death the rich man's "pomp shall not follow him" <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/49-17.htm">Psalm 49:17</a>, and every gift which he has misused, whether of mind or spirit, even the knowledge of God without doing His will, shall but increase damnation. "Sinners will then have nothing but their sins."<p>Here the prophet uses images belonging more to the immediate destruction; at the close the words again widen, and belong, in their fullest literal sense, to the Day of Judgment. "The whole land," rather, as at the beginning, "the whole earth shall be devoured by the fire of His jelousy; for He shall make even a speedy riddance of all them that dwell in the land:" rather, "He shall make an utter, yea altogether  a terriffic destruction of all the dwellers of the earth." What Nahum had foretold of Nineveh , "He shall make the place thereof an utter consumption," that Zephaniah foretells of all the inhabitants of the world. For what is this, "the whole earth shall be devoured by the fire of His jealousy," but what Peter says, "the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up?" <a href="/2_peter/3-13.htm">2 Peter 3:13</a>. And what is that he says, "He shall make all the dwellers of the earth an utter, yea altogether a hasty destruction," but a general judgment of all, who belong to the world, whose home, citizenship, whose whole mind is in the world, not as true Christians, who are strangers and pilgrims here, and their "citizenship is in heaven?" <a href="/hebrews/11-13.htm">Hebrews 11:13</a>; <a href="/philippians/3-20.htm">Philippians 3:20</a>.<p>These God shall make an utter, terrific, speedy destruction, a living death, so that they shall at once both be and not be; be, as continued in being; not be, as having no life of God, but only a continued death in misery. And this shall be through the jealousy of Almighty God, that divine quality in Him, whereby He loves and wills to be loved, and endures not those who give to others the love for which He gave so much and which is so wholly due to Himself Alone. Augustine, Conf. i. 5. p. 3, Oxford Translation: "Thou demandest my love, and if I give it not, art wroth with me, and threatenest me with grievous woes. Is it then a slight woe to love Thee not?" What will be that anger, which is Infinite Love, but which becomes, through man's sin, Hate? <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/zephaniah/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18.

The instruments also whom Jehovah employs to execute His judgments are sometimes animated by a loftiness of purpose and mind that despises mere earthly treasures: “Behold, I stir up the Medes against them, which regard not silver, and as for gold they delight not in it” (<a href="/isaiah/13-17.htm" title="Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them, which shall not regard silver; and as for gold, they shall not delight in it.">Isaiah 13:17</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the whole land</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">the whole earth</span>; ch. <a href="/zephaniah/3-8.htm" title="Therefore wait you on me, said the LORD, until the day that I rise up to the prey: for my determination is to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour on them my indignation, even all my fierce anger: for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy.">Zephaniah 3:8</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">devoured by the fire of his jealousy</span>] “Jealousy” means <span class="ital">heat</span>, and may refer to any violent emotion, as military ardour (<a href="/isaiah/42-13.htm" title="The LORD shall go forth as a mighty man, he shall stir up jealousy like a man of war: he shall cry, yes, roar; he shall prevail against his enemies.">Isaiah 42:13</a>); usually it means the strong reaction or self-assertion of the mind against an injury.

The opinion that Jehovah should be supplied as the subject is a very improbable one, for the simple reason that Jehovah is expressly mentioned in the second dependent clause. The use of &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1488;&#1501;, nisi, as in the similar connection of thought in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-12.htm">Deuteronomy 10:12</a>, may be accounted for from the retrospective allusion to the gifts mentioned by the people: not outward sacrifices of any kind, but only the fulfilment of three following duties: namely, above all things, doing righteousness and exercising love. These two embrace all the commandments of the second table, of whose fulfilment Israel thought so little, that it was addicted to the very opposite, - namely, injustice, oppression, and want of affection (vid., <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/2-1.htm">Micah 2:1-2</a>, <a href="/micah/2-8.htm">Micah 2:8</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/3-2.htm">Micah 3:2-3</a>, <a href="/micah/3-9.htm">Micah 3:9</a> ff., <a href="/micah/6-10.htm">Micah 6:10</a> ff.). There is also a third: humble walk with God, i.e., in fellowship with God, as Israel, being a holy priestly nation, ought to walk. Without these moral virtues, sacrificial worship was a spiritless opus operatum, in which God had no pleasure (see at <a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a> and <a href="/hosea/6-6.htm">Hosea 6:6</a>). </body></html>
