The Jewish royal family shall be reckoned with for their pride and vanity; and those that leap on the threshold, invading their neighbours' rights, and seizing their possessions. The trading people and the rich merchants are called to account. Secure and careless people are reckoned with. They are secure and easy; they say in their heart, the Lord will not do good, neither will he do evil; that is, they deny his dispensing rewards and punishments. But in the day of the Lord's judgment, it will clearly appear that those who perish, fall a sacrifice to Divine justice for breaking God's law, and because they have no interest by faith in the Redeemer's atoning sacrifice.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/zephaniah/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I will search - (Literally, "diligently"). The word is always used of a minute diligent search, whereby places, persons, things, are searched and sifted one by one in every corner, until it be found whether a thing be there or no . Hence, also of the searching out of every thought of the heart, either by God <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/20-27.htm">Proverbs 20:27</a>, or in repentance by the light of God <a href="/lamentations/3-40.htm">Lamentations 3:40</a>.<p>Jerusalem with candles - so that there should be no corner, no lurking-place so dark, but that the guilty should be brought to light. The same diligence, which Eternal Wisdom used, to "seek and to save that which was lost <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/15-8.htm">Luke 15:8</a>, lighting a candle and searching diligently," until it find each lost piece of silver, the same shall Almighty God use that no hardened sinner shall escape. Cyril: "What the enemy would do, using unmingled phrensy against the conquered, that God fitteth to His own Person, not as being Himself the Doer of things so foreign, but rather permitting that what comes from anger should proceed in judgment against the ungodly." It was an image of this, when, at the taking of Jerusalem by the Romans, they  "dragged out of common sewers and holes and caves and tombs, princes and great men and priests, who for fear of death had hid themselves."<p>How much more in that Day when "the secrets of all hearts shalt be revealed" by Him who "searcheth the hearts and reins, and to Whose Eyes" <a href="/psalms/7-9.htm">Psalm 7:9</a>; <a href="/psalms/26-2.htm">Psalm 26:2</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/11-20.htm">Jeremiah 11:20</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/17-10.htm">Jeremiah 17:10</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/20-12.htm">Jeremiah 20:12</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/2-23.htm">Revelation 2:23</a>, "which are like flashing Fire, all things are naked and open!" <a href="/revelation/1-14.htm">Revelation 1:14</a>.

Those, through the Holy Spirit in each, may enlighten the heart of man, or, if he takes not heed, will rise in judgment against him, and show the falsehood of all vain excuses. : "One way of escape only there is. If we judge ourselves, we shall not be judged. I will "search out my" own "ways" and my desires, that He who "shall search out Jerusalem with candles," may find nothing in me, unsought and unsifted. For He will not twice judge the same thing. Would that I might so follow and track out all my offences, that in none I need fear His piercing Eyes, in none be ashamed at the light of His candles! Now I am seen, but I see not. At hand is that Eye, to whom all things are open, although Itself is not open. Once "I shall know, even as I am known" <a href="/1_corinthians/13-12.htm">1 Corinthians 13:12</a>. Now "I know in part," but I am not known in part, but wholly."<p>The men that are settled on their lees - Stiffened and contracted . The image is from wine which becomes harsh, if allowed to remain upon the lees, unremoved. It is drawn out by Jeremiah, "Moab hath been at ease from his youth, and he hath settled on his lees, and hath not been emptied from vessel to vessel, neither hath he gone into captivity; therefore his taste remained in him, and his scent is not changed" <a href="/jeremiah/48-11.htm">Jeremiah 48:11</a>. So they upon whom "no changes come, fear not God (see <a href="/psalms/55-19.htm">Psalm 55:19</a>). The lees are the refuse of the wine, yet stored up (so the word means) with it, and the wine rests, as it were, upon them. So do men of ease rest in things defiled and defiling, their riches or their pleasure, which they hoard up, on which they are bent, so that they, Dionysius: "lift not their mind to things above, but, darkened with foulest desires, are hardened and stiffened in sin."<p>That say in their heart - Not openly scoffing, perhaps thinking that they believe; but people "do" believe as they love. Their most inward belief, the belief of their heart and affections, what they wish, and the hidden spring of their actions, is, "The Lord will not do good, neither will He do evil." They act as believing so, and by acting inure themselves to believe it. They think of God as far away, "Is not God in the height of heaven? And behold the height of the stars, how high they are! And thou sayest, How doth God know? Can He judge through the dark cloud? Thick goads are a covering to Him, that He seeth not; and He walketh in the circuit of heaven" <a href="//biblehub.com/job/22-12.htm">Job 22:12-14</a>, "The ungodly in the pride of his heart" (thinketh); "He will not inquire; all his devices" (speak), "There is no God. Strong are his ways at all times; on high are Thy judgments out of his sight" <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/10-4.htm">Psalm 10:4-5</a>. "They slay the widow and the stranger, and murder the fatherless, and they say, The Lord shall not see, neither shall the God of Jacob regard it" <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/94-5.htm">Psalm 94:5-6</a>.<p>"Such things they did imagine and were deceived, for their own wickedness blinded them. As for the mysteries of God, they knew them not" (Wisd. 2:21-22). "Faith without works is dead" <a href="/james/2-20.htm">James 2:20</a>. Faith which acts not dies out, and there comes in its stead this other persuasion, that God will not repay. There are more Atheists than believe themselves to be such. These act as if there were no Judge of their deeds, and at last come, themselves to believe that God will not punish <a href="/isaiah/5-19.htm">Isaiah 5:19</a>; <a href="/malachi/2-17.htm">Malachi 2:17</a>. What else is the thought of all worldlings, of all who make idols to themselves of any pleasure or gain or ambition, but "God will not punish?" "God cannot punish the (wrongful, selfish,) indulgence of the nature which He has made." "God will not be so precise." "God will not punish with everlasting severance from Him, the sins of this short life." And they see not that they ascribe to God, what He attributes to idols that is, not-gods. "Do good or do evil, that we may be dismayed and behold it together" . "Be not afraid of them, for they cannot do evil, neither also is it in them to do good" <a href="/jeremiah/10-5.htm">Jeremiah 10:5</a>. These think not that God does good, for they ascribe their success to their own diligence, wisdom, strength, and thank not God for it. They think not that He sends them evil. For they defy Him and His laws, and think that they shall go unpunished. What remains but that He should be as dumb an idol as those of the pagan? <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/zephaniah/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. search &#8230; with candles&#8212;or lamps; so as to leave no dark corner in it wherein sin can escape the punishment, of which the Chaldeans are My instruments (compare Zep 1:13; Lu 15:8).<p>settled on their lees&#8212;"hardened" or crusted; image from the crust formed at the bottom of wines long left undisturbed (Jer 48:11).

To find out the sins of the inhabitants of it, and the authors of them, and punish them for them, however hid and concealed from the eyes of others, or thought to be: this must be understood consistent with the omniscience of God, who knows all persons and things; nothing is hid from him; men may fancy their sins are hid, being privately and secretly committed; but all will be manifest, sooner or later; if not now, yet at the day of judgment; and sometimes they are made manifest by God in this life, as here; for what the Lord here says he would do, he did it by instruments, by the Chaldeans, whom he sent to Jerusalem; and to whom the gates of the city, the doors of houses, and the innermost recesses of them, were opened and plundered by them; and all for the sins of the people, which were hereby exposed. So the Targum, <p>"and it shall be at that time that I will appoint searchers, and they shall search Jerusalem, as they that search with candles;'' <p>and no doubt but this was literally true of the Chaldeans, who with candles might search vaults and cellars, and such like dark places, where they supposed goods and riches were concealed. The allusion may be to the searching with lamps for leaven on the fourteenth of Nisan, when the passover began, in every corner of a house, and, when they found it, burnt it (u); or in general to searching for anything which lies concealed in dark places, where the light of the sun comes not, and can only be discovered by the light of candles; and denotes that nothing should escape the sight and knowledge of God, by whom a full discovery would be made of their persons and sins, and cognizance taken of them in a vindictive way, as follows: <p>and punish the men that are settled on their lees; like wine on the lees, quiet and undisturbed; in a good outward estate and condition, abounding in wealth and riches, and trusting therein; and which, as the Targum paraphrases it, they enjoy in great tranquillity; Moab like, having never been emptied from vessel to vessel, <a href="/jeremiah/48-11.htm">Jeremiah 48:11</a> and so concluded they should ever remain in the same state, and became hardened in sin, or "curdled", and thickened, as the word (w) signifies; and were unconcerned about the state of religion, or the state of their own souls; and fearless and thoughtless of the judgments of God; but should now be visited, disturbed in their tranquil state, and be troubled and punished: <p>that say in their heart; not daring to express with their lips the following atheism and blasphemy; but God, who searched and tried their hearts, knew it: <p>The Lord will not do good, neither will he do evil; which is a flat denial of his providence; saying that he takes no notice of what is done by men on earth, whether good or bad; and neither rewards the one, nor punishes the other. So the Targum, as Kimchi quotes it, <p>"it is not the good pleasure of God to do good to the righteous, or to do evil to the wicked;'' <p>than which nothing is more false! the Lord does good to all in a providential way, and to many in a way of special grace; and rewards with a reward of grace all good men, both here and hereafter; and though he does not do any moral evil, yet he executes the evil of punishment in this world, and in that to come, on evildoers. <p>(u) Vid.

In <a href="/micah/6-1.htm">Micah 6:1</a> the nation of Israel is addressed in its several members. They are to hear what the Lord says to the prophet, - namely, the summons addressed to the mountains and hills to hear Jehovah's contest with His people. The words "strive with the mountains" cannot be understood here as signifying that the mountains are the objects of the accusation, notwithstanding the fact that &#1512;&#1497;&#1489; &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1508; signifies to strive or quarrel with a person (<a href="/judges/8-1.htm">Judges 8:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/50-8.htm">Isaiah 50:8</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/2-9.htm">Jeremiah 2:9</a>); for, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/6-2.htm">Micah 6:2</a>, they are to hear the contest of Jehovah with Israel, and therefore are to be merely witnesses on the occasion. Consequently &#1488;&#1514; can only express the idea of fellowship here, and &#1512;&#1497;&#1489; &#1488;&#1514; must be distinguished from &#1512;&#1497;&#1489; &#1506;&#1501; in <a href="/micah/6-2.htm">Micah 6:2</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/4-1.htm">Hosea 4:1</a>, etc. The mountains and hills are to hearken to the contest (as in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-1.htm">Deuteronomy 32:1</a> and <a href="/isaiah/1-2.htm">Isaiah 1:2</a>), as witnesses, "who have seen what the Lord has done for Israel throughout the course of ages, and how Israel has rewarded Him for it all" (Caspari), to bear witness on behalf of the Lord, and against Israel. Accordingly the mountains are called &#1492;&#1488;&#1514;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, the constantly enduring, immutable ones, which have been spectators from time immemorial, and &#1502;&#1493;&#1505;&#1491;&#1497; &#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, foundations of the earth, as being subject to no change on account of their strength and firmness. In this respect they are often called "the everlasting mountains" (e.g., <a href="/genesis/49-26.htm">Genesis 49:26</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/33-15.htm">Deuteronomy 33:15</a>; <a href="/psalms/90-2.htm">Psalm 90:2</a>; <a href="/habakkuk/3-6.htm">Habakkuk 3:6</a>). Israel is called &#768;&#8219;amm&#305;&#772; (Jehovah's people) with intentional emphasis, not only to indicate the right of Jehovah to contend with it, but to sharpen its own conscience, by pointing to its calling. Hithvakkach, like hivva&#770;khach in the niphal in <a href="/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a>. </body></html>
