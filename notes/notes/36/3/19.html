When the cause is removed, the effect will cease. What makes a people holy, will make them happy. The precious promises made to the purified people, were to have full accomplishment in the gospel. These verses appear chiefly to relate to the future conversion and restoration of Israel, and the glorious times which are to follow. They show the abundant peace, comfort, and prosperity of the church, in the happy times yet to come. He will save; he will be Jesus; he will answer the name, for he will save his people from their sins. Before the glorious times foretold, believers would be sorrowful, and objects of reproach. But the Lord will save the weakest believer, and cause true Christians to be greatly honoured where they had been treated with contempt. One act of mercy and grace shall serve, both to gather Israel out of their dispersions and to lead them to their own land. Then will God's Israel be made a name and a praise to eternity. The events alone can fully answer the language of this prophecy. Many are the troubles of the righteous, but they may rejoice in God's love. Surely our hearts should honour the Lord, and rejoice in him, when we hear such words of condescension and grace. If now kept from his ordinances, it is our trial and grief; but in due time we shall be gathered into his temple above. The glory and happiness of the believer will be perfect, unchangeable, and eternal, when he is freed from earthly sorrows, and brought to heavenly bliss.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/zephaniah/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Behold, at that time I will undo - (Literally, I deal with .

Or, "I will do" (w); their business for them; "slay" them, as the Vulgate Latin version; and make an entire destruction of them, as the Targum; bring them to utter ruin. This must be understood of antichrist, both eastern and western, the Turk and Pope, and all the antichristian states that have afflicted the Jews, or shall attempt to distress them at the time of their conversion; and will be fulfilled at the time of the pouring out of the seven vials of God's wrath upon them, which will issue in the entire undoing and ruin of them, especially the seventh and last of them; which, when poured out, will clear the world of all the enemies of Christ, his church and people; and because this will be a wonderful event, and of great moment and importance, hence the word "behold" is prefixed to it, as exciting attention, as well as a note of admiration and asseveration: "and I will save her that halteth", that has sinned, and is weak in faith, and cannot walk, at least but haltingly; which is like a lame and maimed sheep, of which there is danger of its being left behind and lost; but the Lord here promises he will take care of such, and save them from all their sins, and out of the hands of all their enemies; and bring them through all difficulties and discouragements into his church, and to their own land; they shall none of them be lost, even the meanest and weakest of them, any more than the healthful and strong: <p>and gather her that was driven out; even everyone that was scattered abroad in each of the nations of the world; See Gill on <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/4-6.htm">Micah 4:6</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/4-7.htm">Micah 4:7</a>, <p>and I will get them praise and fame in every land, where they have been put to shame; being converted, they shall be spoke well of everywhere; they shall be praised for their ingenuous acknowledgment of their sins; for their sincere repentance of them; and for their faith in Christ, and for their ready submission to his Gospel and ordinances; and the fame of their conversion shall be spread everywhere; and they shall be in great credit and esteem in all Christian countries, where their name has been used for a taunt and a proverb; and so, "instead of their shame", as R.

The precise sense is not clear. In the passages in Jer. the people, being righteous and blessed, are the <span class="ital">source</span> of praise and renown to Jehovah, whose people they are. But the meaning might be that the people themselves are the <span class="ital">object</span> of praise by the nations; <a href="/isaiah/61-9.htm" title="And their seed shall be known among the Gentiles, and their offspring among the people: all that see them shall acknowledge them, that they are the seed which the LORD has blessed.">Isaiah 61:9</a>; <a href="/isaiah/62-7.htm" title="And give him no rest, till he establish, and till he make Jerusalem a praise in the earth.">Isaiah 62:7</a>. Both ideas are elsewhere expressed; Jehovah bestows His glory on Israel (<a href="/isaiah/60-2.htm" title="For, behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people: but the LORD shall arise on you, and his glory shall be seen on you.">Isaiah 60:2</a>), and this glory is reflected back upon Him, and He is glorified in Israel (<a href="/isaiah/44-23.htm" title="Sing, O you heavens; for the LORD has done it: shout, you lower parts of the earth: break forth into singing, you mountains, O forest, and every tree therein: for the LORD has redeemed Jacob, and glorified himself in Israel.">Isaiah 44:23</a>; <a href="/isaiah/49-3.htm" title="And said to me, You are my servant, O Israel, in whom I will be glorified.">Isaiah 49:3</a>; <a href="/isaiah/60-21.htm" title="Your people also shall be all righteous: they shall inherit the land for ever, the branch of my planting, the work of my hands, that I may be glorified.">Isaiah 60:21</a>; <a href="/isaiah/61-3.htm" title="To appoint to them that mourn in Zion, to give to them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, that he might be glorified.">Isaiah 61:3</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">In every land … put to shame</span>] A.V. marg., Heb. (every land) <span class="ital">of their shame</span>. R.V. renders: <span class="ital">whose shame hath been in all the earth</span>. Both renderings are possible, but both are unnatural. R.V. lays an unnatural emphasis upon the pronoun: “I will make <span class="ital">them</span> a praise and a name, whose shame,” &c., whereas “them” seems rather to refer back to “her that halteth” and “her that was driven away,” or, to the people generally. On the other hand, the construction assumed by A.V. is ungrammatical, although occasional instances of it appear. The Sept. rightly felt that the natural sense of the passage was: <span class="ital">and I will make them a praise and a name in all the earth</span> (<span class="ital"><a href="/zephaniah/3-20.htm" title="At that time will I bring you again, even in the time that I gather you: for I will make you a name and a praise among all people of the earth, when I turn back your captivity before your eyes, said the LORD.">Zephaniah 3:20</a></span>), and so rendered. The Heb. word <span class="ital">their shame</span>, still remaining undisposed of in this rendering, the Sept. attached to the next verse: <span class="ital">and they shall be ashamed at that time</span>. This is quite unsatisfactory. But the analogy of <span class="ital"><a href="/zephaniah/3-20.htm" title="At that time will I bring you again, even in the time that I gather you: for I will make you a name and a praise among all people of the earth, when I turn back your captivity before your eyes, said the LORD.">Zephaniah 3:20</a></span>, <span class="ital">a name and a praise among all the peoples of the earth</span>, suggests that the expression <span class="ital">their shame</span> is not original.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/zephaniah/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will undo all that afflict thee;</span> <span class="accented">I will deal with</span> in punishment (<a href="/jeremiah/18-23.htm">Jeremiah 18:23</a>); Vulgate, "I will slay."
