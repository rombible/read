A sinful state is, and will be, a woful state. Yet they had the tokens of God's presence, and all the advantages of knowing his will, with the strongest reasons to do it; still they persisted in disobedience. Alas, that men often are more active in doing wickedness than believers are in doing good.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/zephaniah/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I said, surely thou wilt fear Me - God speaks of things here, as they are in their own nature. "It could not but be," that in the very presence of the Hand of God, destroying others but as yet sparing them, they must learn to fear Him; they must stand in awe of Him for His judgments on others; they must be in filial fear of Him for His loving longsuffering toward themselves. "Thou 'wilt' receive instruction," corrected and taught through God's correction of others and the lighter judgments on themselves, as Solomon says, "I looked, I set my heart: I saw, I received instruction" <a href="/proverbs/24-32.htm">Proverbs 24:32</a>. He saith, "receive," making it man's free act. God brings it near, commends it to him, exhorts, entreats, but leaves him the awful power to "receive" or to refuse. God speaks with a wonderful tenderness. "Surely thou 'wilt' stand in awe of Me; thou 'wilt' receive instruction; thou wilt now do what hitherto thou hast refused to do." There was (so to speak) nothing else left for them, in sight of those judgments. He pleads their own interests. The lightning was ready to fall. The prophet had, in vision, seen the enemy within the city. Yet even now God lingers, as it were, "If thou hadst known in this thy day, the things which are for thy peace" <a href="/luke/19-42.htm">Luke 19:42</a>.<p>So their - (her) dwelling should not be cut off His own holy land which He had given them. A Jew paraphrases , "And He will not cut off their dwellings from the land of the house of My Shechinah" (God's visible presence in glory). Judah, who was before addressed "thou," is now spoken of in the third person, "her;" and this also had wonderful tenderness. It is as though God were musing over her and the blessed fruits of her return to Him; "it shall not be needed to correct her further." "Howsoever I punished them:" literally, "all" (that is, 'all' the offences) "which I visited upon her," as God saith of Himself, "'visiting' the 'sins' of the fathers 'upon' the children" <a href="/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>; <a href="/exodus/34-7.htm">Exodus 34:7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/14-18.htm">Numbers 14:18</a>, and this is mostly the meaning of the words  "visit upon." Amid and not withstanding all the offences which God had already chastised, He, in His love and compassion, still longeth, not utterly to remove them from His presence, if they would but receive instruction "now;" but they would not. "How often," our Lord says, "would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not" <a href="/matthew/23-37.htm">Matthew 23:37</a>. "But indeed," "probably, Of a truth"  (it is a word strongly affirming what follows) "they rose early, they corrupted all their doings;" God gave them His warnings, awaited the result; they lost no time, they began with morning light; they hasted to rise, burdened  themselves, made sure of having the whole day before them, to - seek God as He had sent His prophets, "rising early and sending them?" <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-13.htm">Jeremiah 7:13</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/7-25.htm">Jeremiah 7:25</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/11-7.htm">Jeremiah 11:7</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/26-5.htm">Jeremiah 26:5</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/29-19.htm">Jeremiah 29:19</a>.<p>No, nor even simply to do ill, but of set purpose. to do, not this or that corruptly, but "to corrupt all their doings." Jerome: "They with diligence and eagerness rose early, that, with the same haste wherewith they ought to have returned to Me, they might shew forth in deed what they had conceived amiss in their mind." There are as many aggravations of their sin as there are words. The four Hebrew words bespeak eagerness, willfulness, completeness enormity, in sin. They "rose early," themselves deliberately "corrupted," of their own mind made offensive, "all" their "doings," not slight acts, but "deeds," great works done with a high hand . <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/zephaniah/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7.

"Feed thy people with thy staff, the sheep of thine inheritance, dwelling apart, in the wood, in the midst of Carmel: let them feed in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of the olden time." The question in dispute among commentators, whether this prayer is addressed to the Lord by the prophet on behalf of the nation, or whether the prophet is still speaking in the name of the believing church, is decided in favour of the latter by the answer addressed to the church in <a href="/micah/7-15.htm">Micah 7:15</a>. The Lord is addressed as the shepherd of Israel, the title by which Jacob addressed Him in <a href="/genesis/49-24.htm">Genesis 49:24</a> (cf. <a href="/psalms/80-2.htm">Psalm 80:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/23-1.htm">Psalm 23:1</a> ff.). The prayer is related to the promise in <a href="/micah/5-3.htm">Micah 5:3</a> ff., viz., that the ruler coming forth out of Bethlehem will feed in the strength of Jehovah, and involves the prayer for the sending of this ruler. "With this staff," i.e., the shepherd's staff (cf. <a href="/leviticus/27-32.htm">Leviticus 27:32</a>; <a href="/psalms/23-4.htm">Psalm 23:4</a>), is added pictorially; and as a support to the prayer, it designates the people as the sheep of Jehovah's inheritance. &#1510;&#1488;&#1503; &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1492;, instead of &#1506;&#1501; &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1492;, which occurs more frequently, is occasioned by the figure of the shepherd. As the sheep need the protection of the shepherd, lest they should perish, so Israel needs the guidance of its God, that it may not be destroyed by its foes. The following apposition &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1504;&#1497; &#1500;&#1489;&#1491;&#1491; determines the manner of the feeding more precisely; so that we may resolve it into the clause, "so that thy people may dwell apart." The words contain an allusion to <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/23-9.htm">Numbers 23:9</a>, where Balaam describes Israel as a people separated from the rest of the nations; and to <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-28.htm">Deuteronomy 33:28</a>, where Moses congratulates it, because it dwells in safety and alone (ba&#770;da&#770;d, separate), under the protection of its God, in a land full of corn, new wine, etc. The church asks for the fulfilment of this blessing from Jehovah its shepherd, that it may dwell separate from the nations of the world, so that they may not be able to do it any harm; and that "in the wood in the midst of Carmel," that promontory abounding in wood and pasture land (laetis pascuis abundat: Jerome on <a href="/amos/1-2.htm">Amos 1:2</a>). The wood is thought of here as shutting off the flock from the world without, withdrawing it from its sight, and affording it security; and the fact that dangerous wild beasts have their home in the forest (<a href="/jeremiah/5-6.htm">Jeremiah 5:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/80-14.htm">Psalm 80:14</a>) is overlooked here, because Israel is protected from them by its own shepherd. &#1497;&#1512;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;, which follows, is not future, but optative, corresponding to the imperative &#1512;&#1506;&#1492;. Gilead and Bashan are also named as portions of the land that were rich in pasture (cf. <a href="/numbers/32-1.htm">Numbers 32:1</a> ff.), namely, of the land to the east of the Jordan, Carmel belonging to the western portion of Canaan. These three portions individualize the whole of the territory which Israel received for its inheritance, and not merely the territory of the kingdom of the ten tribes. The simple reason why no districts in the kingdom of Judah are mentioned, is that Judah possessed no woody districts abounding in grass and pasture resembling those named. Moreover, the prayer refers to the whole of Israel, or rather to the remnant of the whole nation that has been rescued from the judgment, and which will form an undivided flock under the Messiah (cf. <a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/11-13.htm">Isaiah 11:13</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/37-15.htm">Ezekiel 37:15</a> ff.). &#1497;&#1502;&#1497; &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501;, "the days of old," are the times of Moses and Joshua, when the Lord brought Israel with His mighty arm into the possession of the promised land. The Lord answers this prayer, by promising, according to His abundant goodness, more than the church has asked. <a href="/micah/7-15.htm">Micah 7:15</a>. "As in the days of thy going out of the land of Egypt will I cause it to see wonders. <a href="/micah/7-16.htm">Micah 7:16</a>. Nations will see it, and be ashamed of all their strength: they will lay the hand upon the mouth, their ears will become deaf. <a href="/micah/7-17.htm">Micah 7:17</a>. They will lick dust like the snake, like the reptiles of the earth they come trembling out of their castles: they will go trembling to Jehovah our God, and before thee will they fear." The wonders (niphla&#770;'o&#772;th; cf. <a href="/exodus/3-20.htm">Exodus 3:20</a>; <a href="/exodus/15-11.htm">Exodus 15:11</a>; <a href="/psalms/78-11.htm">Psalm 78:11</a>) with which the Lord formerly smote Egypt, to redeem His people out of the bondage of that kingdom of the world, will the Lord renew for His people. In &#1510;&#1488;&#1514;&#1498; the nation is addressed, whilst the suffix of the third pers. attached to &#1488;&#1512;&#1488;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; points back to &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1498; in <a href="/micah/7-14.htm">Micah 7:14</a>. The miraculous deeds will make such an impression, that the heathen nations who see them will stand ashamed, dumb and deaf with alarm and horror. Ashamed of all their strength, i.e., because all their strength becomes impotence before the mighty acts of the Almighty God. Laying the hand upon the mouth is a gesture expressive of reverential silence from astonishment and admiration (cf. <a href="/judges/18-19.htm">Judges 18:19</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/21-5.htm">Job 21:5</a>, etc.). Their ears shall become deaf "from the thunder of His mighty acts, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/26-14.htm">Job 26:14</a>, the qo&#772;l ha&#770;mo&#772;n of <a href="/isaiah/33-8.htm">Isaiah 33:8</a>" (Hitzig). With this description of the impression made by the wonderful works of God, the words of God pass imperceptibly into words of the prophet, who carries out the divine answer still further in an explanatory form, as we may see from <a href="/isaiah/33-17.htm">Isaiah 33:17</a>. The heathen will submit themselves to Jehovah in the humblest fear. This is stated in <a href="/micah/7-17.htm">Micah 7:17</a>. Licking the dust like the serpent contains an allusion to <a href="/genesis/3-14.htm">Genesis 3:14</a> (cf. <a href="/psalms/72-9.htm">Psalm 72:9</a> and <a href="/isaiah/49-23.htm">Isaiah 49:23</a>). &#1494;&#1495;&#1500;&#1497; &#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, earth-creepers, i.e., snakes, recals the &#1494;&#1495;&#1500;&#1497; &#1506;&#1508;&#1512; of <a href="/deuteronomy/32-24.htm">Deuteronomy 32:24</a>. Like snakes, when they are driven out of their hiding-place, or when charmers make them come out of their holes, so will the nations come trembling out of their castles (misgero&#772;th as in <a href="/psalms/18-46.htm">Psalm 18:46</a>), and tremble to Jehovah, i.e., flee to Him with trembling, as alone able to grant help (see <a href="/hosea/3-5.htm">Hosea 3:5</a>), and fear before thee. With &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1498;&#1468; the prayer passes into an address to Jehovah, to attach to this the praise of God with which he closes his book. </body></html>
