The swift, short clauses, the triple invocation in the former verse, the triple promise in the latter, the heaped together synonyms, all help the impression. The very words seem to dance with joy. But more remarkable than this is the parallelism between the two verses. Zion is called to rejoice in God because God rejoices in her. She is to shout for joy and sing because God’s joy too has a voice, and breaks out into singing. For every throb of joy in man’s heart, there is a wave of gladness in God’s. The notes of our praise are at once the echoes and the occasions of His. We are to be glad because He is glad: He is glad because we are so. We sing for joy, and He joys over us with singing because we do.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. God’s joy over Zion.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>It is to be noticed that the former verse of our text is followed by the assurance: ‘The Lord is in the midst of thee’; and that the latter verse is preceded by the same assurance. So, then, intimate fellowship and communion between God and Israel lies at the root both of God’s joy in man and man’s joy in God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> We are solemnly warned by ‘profound thinkers’ of letting the shadow of our emotions fall upon God. No doubt there is a real danger there; but there is a worse danger, that of conceiving of a God who has no life and heart; and it is better to hold fast by this-that in Him is that which corresponds to what in us is gladness. We are often told, too, that the Jehovah of the Old Testament is a stern and repellent God, and the religion of the Old Testament is gloomy and servile. But such a misconception is hard to maintain in the face of such words as these. Zephaniah, of whom we know little, and whose words are mainly forecasts of judgments and woes pronounced against Zion that was rebellious and polluted, ends his prophecy with these companion pictures, like a gleam of sunshine which often streams out at the close of a dark winter’s day. To him the judgments which he prophesied were no contradiction of the love and gladness of God. The thought of a glad God might be a very awful thought; such an insight as this prophet had gives a blessed meaning to it. We may think of the joy that belongs to the divine nature as coming from the completeness of His being, which is raised far above all that makes of sorrow. But it is not in Himself alone that He is glad; but it is because He loves. The exercise of love is ever blessedness. His joy is in self-impartation; His delights are in the sons of men: ‘As the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride, so shall thy God rejoice over thee.’ His gladness is in His children when they let Him love them, and do not throw back His love on itself. As in man’s physical frame it is pain to have secretions dammed up, so when God’s love is forced back upon itself and prevented from flowing out in blessing, some shadow of suffering cannot but pass across that calm sky. He is glad when His face is mirrored in ours, and the rays from Him are reflected from us.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> But there is another wonderfully bold and beautiful thought in this representation of the gladness of God. Note the double form which it assumes: ‘He will rest’-literally, be silent-’in His love; He will joy over thee with singing.’ As to the former, loving hearts on earth know that the deepest love knows no utterance, and can find none. A heart full of love rests as having attained its desire and accomplished its purpose. It keeps a perpetual Sabbath, and is content to be silent.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> But side by side with this picture of the repose of God’s joy is set with great poetic insight the precisely opposite image of a love which delights in expression, and rejoices over its object with singing. The combination of the two helps to express the depth and intensity of the one love, which like a song-bird rises with quivering delight and pours out as it rises an ever louder and more joyous note, and then drops, composed and still, to its nest upon the dewy ground.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. Zion’s joy in God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>To the Prophet, the fact that ‘the Lord is in the midst of thee’ was the guarantee for the confident assurance ‘Thou shalt not fear any more’; and this assurance was to be the occasion of exuberant gladness, which ripples over in the very words of our first text. That great thought of ‘God dwelling in the midst’ is rightly a pain and a terror to rebellious wills and alienated hearts. It needs some preparation of mind and spirit to be glad because God is near; and they who find their satisfaction in earthly sources, and those who seek for it in these, see no word of good news, but rather a ‘fearful looking for of judgment’ in the thought that God is in their midst. The word rendered ‘rejoices’ in the first verse of our text is not the same as that so translated in the second. The latter means literally, to move in a circle; while the former literally means, to leap for joy. Thus the gladness of God is thought of as expressing itself in dignified, calm movements, whilst Zion’s joy is likened in its expression to the more violent movements of the dance. True human joy is like God’s, in that He delights in us and we in Him, and in that both He and we delight in the exercise of love. But we are never to forget that the differences are real as the resemblances, and that it is reserved for the higher form of our experiences in a future life to ‘enter into the joy of the Lord.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> It becomes us to see to it that our religion is a religion of joy. Our text is an authoritative command as well as a joyful exhortation, and we do not fairly represent the facts of Christian faith if we do not ‘rejoice in the Lord always.’ In all the sadness and troubles which necessarily accompany us, as they do all men, we ought by the effort of faith to set the Lord always before us that we be not moved. The secret of stable and perpetual joy still lies where Zephaniah found it-in the assurance that the Lord is with us, and in the vision of His love resting upon us, and rejoicing over us with singing. If thus our love clasps His, and His joy finds its way into our hearts, it will remain with us that our ‘joy may be full’; and being guarded by Him whilst still there is fear of stumbling, He will set us at last ‘before the presence of His glory without blemish in exceeding joy.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/zephaniah/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/zephaniah/3-14.htm" title="Sing, O daughter of Zion; shout, O Israel; be glad and rejoice with all the heart, O daughter of Jerusalem....">Zephaniah 3:14-15</a></span>. <span class="ital">Sing, O daughter of Zion — </span>At that time, O daughter of Zion, thou shalt break forth into loud and joyful praises to Jehovah, for his goodness toward thee; and thou mayest even now do it, for thou shalt certainly enjoy this prosperous state.

Thus, after the promises to take away sin, here follow promises of the taking away of trouble; for when the cause is removed, the effect will cease. What makes a people holy, will make them happy of course. But the precious promises here made to God’s purified people, although in some measure fulfilled to the Jews at their return from captivity, yet, in their full propriety of meaning, belong to the times of the gospel, and have their full accomplishment only in the comforts and joyful hopes of future felicity, which are the portion of the true disciples of the Lord Jesus. <span class="ital">The Lord hath taken away thy judgments — </span>That is, thy punishments.

When the cause is removed, the effect will cease. What makes a people holy, will make them happy. The precious promises made to the purified people, were to have full accomplishment in the gospel. These verses appear chiefly to relate to the future conversion and restoration of Israel, and the glorious times which are to follow. They show the abundant peace, comfort, and prosperity of the church, in the happy times yet to come. He will save; he will be Jesus; he will answer the name, for he will save his people from their sins. Before the glorious times foretold, believers would be sorrowful, and objects of reproach. But the Lord will save the weakest believer, and cause true Christians to be greatly honoured where they had been treated with contempt. One act of mercy and grace shall serve, both to gather Israel out of their dispersions and to lead them to their own land. Then will God's Israel be made a name and a praise to eternity. The events alone can fully answer the language of this prophecy. Many are the troubles of the righteous, but they may rejoice in God's love. Surely our hearts should honour the Lord, and rejoice in him, when we hear such words of condescension and grace. If now kept from his ordinances, it is our trial and grief; but in due time we shall be gathered into his temple above. The glory and happiness of the believer will be perfect, unchangeable, and eternal, when he is freed from earthly sorrows, and brought to heavenly bliss.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/zephaniah/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Sing, O daughter of Sion; shout, O Israel; be glad and rejoice with all the heart, O daughter of Jerusalem - Very remarkable throughout all these verses is the use of the sacred number three, secretly conveying to the thoughtful soul the thought of Him, Father Son and Holy Spirit, the Holy and Undivided Trinity by whose operation these things shall be. Threefold is the description of their being freed from sins:<p>(1) they shall "not do iniquity,"<p>(2) "nor speak lies,"<p>(3) "neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth."<p>Threefold their blessedness; They shall:<p>(1) "feed,"<p>(2) "lie down,"<p>(3) "none make them afraid."<p>Threefold the exhortation to joy here.

The prophet enjoins a triple note of exultation in order to confirm the universal joy. (On the use of the number "three" in this passage, see Dr. Pusey's note, p. 480.) <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/nahum/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The heading runs thus: "Burden concerning Nineveh; book of the prophecy of Nahum of Elkosh." The first sentence gives the substance and object, the second the form and author, of the proclamation which follows. &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488; signifies a burden, from &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;, to lift up, to carry, to heave. This meaning has very properly been retained by Jonathan, Aquila, Jerome, Luther, and others, in the headings to the prophetic oracle. Jerome observes on <a href="/habakkuk/1-1.htm">Habakkuk 1:1</a> : "Massa never occurs in the title, except when it is evidently grave and full of weight and labour." On the other hand, the lxx have generally rendered it &#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; in the headings to the oracles, or even &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;, &#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; (<a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/13.htm">Isaiah 13</a>ff., <a href="/isaiah/30-6.htm">Isaiah 30:6</a>); and most of the modern commentators since Cocceius and Vitringa, following this example, have attributed to the word the meaning of "utterance," and derived it from &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;, effari. But &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488; has no more this meaning than &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488; &#1511;&#1493;&#1500; can mean to utter the voice, either in <a href="/exodus/20-7.htm">Exodus 20:7</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/23-1.htm">Exodus 23:1</a>, to which Hupfeld appeals in support of it, or in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/9-25.htm">2 Kings 9:25</a>, to which others appeal. The same may be said of &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488;, which never means effatum, utterance, and is never placed before simple announcements of salvation, but only before oracles of a threatening nature. <a href="/zechariah/9-1.htm">Zechariah 9:1</a> and <a href="/zechariah/12-1.htm">Zechariah 12:1</a> form no exception to this rule. Delitzsch (on <a href="/isaiah/13-1.htm">Isaiah 13:1</a>) observes, with regard to the latter passage, that the promise has at least a dark foil, and in <a href="/nahum/9-1.htm">Nahum 9:1</a>ff. the heathen nations of the Persian and Macedonian world-monarchy are threatened with a divine judgment which will break in pieces their imperial glory, and through which they are to be brought to conversion to Jehovah; "and it is just in this that the burden consists, which the word of God lays upon these nations, that they may be brought to conversion through such a judgment from God" (Kliefoth). Even in <a href="/proverbs/30-1.htm">Proverbs 30:1</a> and <a href="/proverbs/31-1.htm">Proverbs 31:1</a> Massa&#770;' does not mean utterance. The words of Agur in <a href="/proverbs/30-1.htm">Proverbs 30:1</a> are a heavy burden, which is rolled upon the natural and conceited reason; they are punitive in their character, reproving human forwardness in the strongest terms; and in <a href="/proverbs/31-1.htm">Proverbs 31:1</a> Massa&#770;' is the discourse with which king Lemuel reproved his mother. For the thorough vindication of this meaning of Massa&#770;', by an exposition of all the passages which have been adduced in support of the rendering "utterance," see Hengstenberg, Christology, on <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/9-1.htm">Zechariah 9:1</a>, and O. Strauss on this passage. For Nineveh, see the comm. on <a href="/jonah/1-2.htm">Jonah 1:2</a>. The burden, i.e., the threatening words, concerning Nineveh are defined in the second clause as se&#772;pher cha&#770;zo&#772;n, book of the seeing (or of the seen) of Nahum, i.e., of that which Nahum saw in spirit and prophesied concerning Nineveh. The unusual combination of se&#772;pher and cha&#770;zo&#772;n, which only occurs here, is probably intended to show that Nahum simply committed his prophecy concerning Nineveh to writing, and did not first of all announce it orally before the people.
