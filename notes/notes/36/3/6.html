The judgments upon the nations before them were set forth to them, when they were about to enter on their inheritance, as a warning to themselves. "Defile not ye yourselves in any of these things, for in all these have the nations defiled themselves, which I cast out before you: and the land is defiled; therefore I do visit the iniquity thereof upon it, and the land vomiteth out her inhabitants. And ye, ye shall keep My statutes and My judgements and shall not commit any of these abominations - And the land shall not spue you out when ye defile it, as it spued out the nations which were before you" (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/18-24.htm">Leviticus 18:24-26</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/18-28.htm">Leviticus 18:28</a>, add <a href="/leviticus/20-23.htm">Leviticus 20:23</a>). The very possession then of the land was a warning to them; the ruins, which crowned so many of its hilltops , were silent preachers to them; they lived among the memories of God's visitations; if neglected, they were an earnest of future judgments on themselves.<p>Yet God's judgments are not at one time only. Sennacherib appealed to their own knowledge, "Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands by destroying them utterly. Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed?" <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/37-11.htm">Isaiah 37:11</a>, <a href="/isaiah/37-13.htm">Isaiah 37:13</a>. Hezekiah owned it as a fact which he knew: "Of a truth, Lord, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the nations and their land" <a href="/isaiah/37-18.htm">Isaiah 37:18</a>. And God owns him as His instrument: "Now I have brought it to pass, that thou shouldest be to lay waste defensed cities into ruinous heaps" <a href="/isaiah/37-26.htm">Isaiah 37:26</a> : and, "I will send him against an ungodly nation, and against the people of My wrath will I give him a charge, to take the spoil and to take the prey, and to tread them down as the mire of the streets," and says of him, "It is in his heart to destroy and to cut off nations not a few" . The king of Babylon too he describes as "the man that made the earth to tremble, that did shake kingdoms. that made the world as a wilderness, and destroyed the cities thereof" <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/14-16.htm">Isaiah 14:16-17</a>.

"A day to build thy walls (cometh); in that day will the ordinance be far away. <a href="/micah/7-12.htm">Micah 7:12</a>. In that day will they come to thee from Asshur and the cities of Egypt, and from Egypt to the river, and (to) sea from sea, and (from) mountain to mountain. <a href="/micah/7-13.htm">Micah 7:13</a>. And the earth will become a desert because of its inhabitants, for the fruit of their doings." <a href="/micah/7-11.htm">Micah 7:11</a> consists of two clauses; for we may easily supply to yo&#772;m "is" or "will be"  equals  come. The daughter Zion is addressed (cf. <a href="/micah/4-8.htm">Micah 4:8</a>) not as a church, but as a city, as the centre and representative of the kingdom of God. As such, she is compared to a vineyard, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/5-1.htm">Isaiah 5:1-7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/27-2.htm">Isaiah 27:2-4</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/80-9.htm">Psalm 80:9-10</a>. The word ga&#770;de&#772;r, which is generally used for the hedge or wall around a vineyard, points to this (see <a href="/isaiah/5-5.htm">Isaiah 5:5</a>; <a href="/numbers/22-24.htm">Numbers 22:24</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/10-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:8</a>). &#1497;&#1493;&#1503; &#1492;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; is an adverbial accusative; in that day will &#1495;&#1511; be far away. The meaning of this word is very difficult to find, and can hardly be settled with any certainty. The explanation of cho&#772;q, as signifying the law imposed upon Israel by the heathen oppressors (Chald., Hengstenberg, etc.), cannot be sustained, as this meaning cannot be established from <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/104-20.htm">Psalm 104:20</a>, and is not suggested by the context. So, again, the explanation, "On that day will the goal set (for Israel), or the boundary fixed (for it), be a far distant one (i.e., then will the boundaries of the land of Israel lie in the far distance, or be advanced to the remotest distance:" Hitzig, Caspari, and others), introduces a meaning into the words which they do not possess. Even if cho&#772;q does denote a fixed point or a limit of either space or time, it never signifies the boundary of a nation; and ra&#770;chaq, to be far off, is not equivalent to being advanced to a great distance. Cho&#772;q is apparently used here for the ordinance or limit which God has appointed to separate Israel from the nations; not a land-boundary, but the law of Israel's separation from the nations.<p>This law will be far away, i.e., will be removed or set aside (yirach is only chosen for the sake of the assonance with cho&#772;q), inasmuch as numerous crowds, as is added in <a href="/micah/7-12.htm">Micah 7:12</a> by way of explanation, will then stream to Zion, or come to the people of God, out of all lands (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/4-1.htm">Micah 4:1-2</a>). For this is what <a href="/micah/7-12.htm">Micah 7:12</a> refers to, and not the return to Zion of the Israelites who have been scattered in the heathen lands. &#1497;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488; (impersonal), one comes, they come: not "return," &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;, which must have been the expression used if the return of the Israelites out of their captivity had been meant. The heathen who cherish a desire for the God of Zion and His law (<a href="/micah/4-2.htm">Micah 4:2</a>) will come to Israel; not to Israel as still living in their midst (Caspari), but to the Israel that has already returned, and whose walls have been rebuilt (<a href="/micah/7-11.htm">Micah 7:11</a>). The building of the walls of Zion involves the gathering together of the dispersed nation, or rather presupposes it. Heathen will come "from Asshur and the cities of Egypt," i.e., from the two mightiest empires in the time of the prophet. Ma&#770;tso&#772;r, the poetical name of Egypt, as in <a href="/isaiah/19-6.htm">Isaiah 19:6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/37-25.htm">Isaiah 37:25</a>; and "cities of Egypt," because that land or kingdom was especially rich in cities. The further definitions individualize the idea of the totality of the lands and provinces, the correlative members being transposed and incomplete in the last two sentences, so that the preposition &#1506;&#1491; must be supplied to &#1493;&#1497;&#1501;, and the preposition &#1502;&#1503; to &#1492;&#1492;&#1512;. From Egypt to the river (Euphrates) includes the lands lying between these two terminal points; and in the expressions, "sea from sea, and mountain to mountain," seas and mountains are mentioned in the most general manner, as the boundaries of lands and nations; so that we have not to think of any particular seas and mountains, say the Western (or Mediterranean) Sea, and the Eastern (the Dead or the Galilean) Sea, as being the western and eastern boundaries of Palestine, and of Lebanon and Sinai as the northern and southern boundaries, but must adhere firmly to the general character of the expression: "from one sea and one mountain to another sea and mountain," i.e., from every land situated between seas and mountains, that is to say, from all the lands and provinces of the earth. The coming out of all lands is not to be understood as denoting simply passing visits to Canaan or Zion, but as coming to connect themselves with the people of God, to be received into fellowship with them. There is a parallel to this promise in the promise contained in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/19-18.htm">Isaiah 19:18-25</a>, that in the Messianic times Egypt and Asshur will turn to Jehovah. This takes place because the earth will become a desert, on account of the evil deeds of its inhabitants. Whilst Zion is rebuilt, and the people of God are multiplied, by the addition of the godly Gentiles out of all the countries of the earth, the judgment falls upon the sinful world. This statement of <a href="/micah/7-13.htm">Micah 7:13</a> is simply attached to what precedes it by &#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1514;&#1492;, in order to complete the promise of the restoration of Zion, by adding the fate which will befal the earth (i.e., the earth outside Canaan); but it actually contains the motive for the coming of the crowds to Zion. &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; cannot be the land of Israel (Canaan) here, in support of which appeal has been made to <a href="/leviticus/26-33.htm">Leviticus 26:33</a> and <a href="/isaiah/1-7.htm">Isaiah 1:7</a>; for the context neither leads to any such limitation as that &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; could be taken in the sense of &#1488;&#1512;&#1510;&#1499;&#1503; (in Leviticus and Isaiah), nor allows of our thinking of the devastation of Canaan. When the day shall have come for the building of the walls of Zion, the land of Israel will not become a desert then; but, on the contrary, the devastation will cease. If the devastation of Canaan were intended here, we should have either to take &#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1514;&#1492; as a pluperfect, in violation of the rules of the language, or arbitrarily to interpolate "previously," as Hitzig proposes. &#1506;&#1500; &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1497;&#1492; is defined more precisely by &#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497; &#1502;&#1506;&#1500;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;. The doings are of course evil ones, and the deeds themselves are the fruit (cf. <a href="/isaiah/3-10.htm">Isaiah 3:10</a>). </body></html>
