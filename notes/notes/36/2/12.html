Having summoned them to His throne, God speaks of them, not to them anymore; perhaps in compassion, as elsewhere in indignation . The Ethiopians were not in any direct antagonism to God and His people, but allied only to their old oppressor, Egypt. They may have been in Pharaoh Necho's army, in resisting which, as a subject of Assyria, Josiah was slain: they are mentioned <a href="/jeremiah/46-9.htm">Jeremiah 46:9</a> in that army which Nebuchadnezzar smote at Carchemish in the 4th year of Jehoiakim. The prophecy of Ezekiel implies rather, that Ethiopia should be involved in the calamities of Egypt, than that it should be itself invaded. "Great terror shall be in Ethiopia, 'when the slain shall fall in Egypt' <a href="/ezekiel/30-4.htm">Ezekiel 30:4</a>." "Ethiopia and Lybia and Lydia etc. and all the men of the land that is in league, shall fall 'with these,' by the sword" <a href="/ezekiel/30-5.htm">Ezekiel 30:5</a>. "They also that 'uphold Egypt' shall fall" <a href="/ezekiel/30-6.htm">Ezekiel 30:6</a>.<p>Syene, the frontier-fortress over against Ethiopia, is especially mentioned as the boundary also of the destruction. "Messengers" God says, "shall go forth from Me to make the careless Ethiopians afraid" <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-9.htm">Ezekiel 30:9</a>, while the storm was bursting in its full desolating force upon Egypt. All the other cities, whose destruction is foretold, are cities of lower or upper Egypt .<p>But such a blow as that foretold by Jeremiah and Ezekiel must have fallen heavily upon the allies of Egypt. We have no details, for the Egyptians would not, and did not tell of the calamities and disgraces of their country. No one does. Josephus, however, briefly but distinctly says , that after Nebuchadnezzar had in the 23rd year of his reign, the 5th after the destruction of Jerusalem, "reduced into subjection Moab and Ammon, he invaded Egypt, with a view to subdue it," "killed its then king, and having set up another, captured for the second time the Jews in it and carried them to Babylon." The memory of the devastation by Nebuchadnezzar lived on apparently in Egypt, and is a recognized fact among the Muslim historians, who had no interest in the fulfillment of Jewish prophecy, of which it does not appear that they even knew.<p>Bokht-nasar (Nebuchadnezzar), they say , "made war on the son of Nechas (Necho), slew him and ruined the city of Memphis" and many other cities of Egypt: he carried the inhabitants captive, without leaving one, so that Egypt remained waste forty years without one inhabitant." Another says , The refuge which the king of Egypt granted to the Jews who fled from Nebuchadnezzar brought this war upon it: for he took them under his protection and would not give them up to their enemy. Nebuchadnezzar, in revenge, marched against the king of Egypt and destroyed the country." "One may be certain," says a good authority , "that the conquest of Egypt by Nebuchadnezzar was a tradition generally spread in Egypt and questioned by no one."<p>Ethiopia was then involved, as an ally, and as far as its contingent was concerned, in the war, in which Nebuchadnezzar desolated Egypt for those 40 years. But, although this fulfilled the prophecy of Ezekiel, Isaiah, some sixty years before Zephaniah, prophesied a direct conquest of Ethiopia. I "have given," God says, "Egypt as thy ransom, Ethiopia and Seba for thee" <a href="/isaiah/43-3.htm">Isaiah 43:3</a>. It lay in God's purpose, that Cyrus should restore His own people, and that his ambition should find its vent and compensation in the lands beyond. It may be that, contrary to all known human policy, Cyrus restored the Jews to their own land, willing to bind them to himself, and to make them a frontier territory toward Egypt, not subject only but loyal to himself. This is quite consistent with the reason which he assigns; "The Lord God of heaven hath given me all the kingdoms of the earth; and He hath charged me to build Him an house at Jerusalem which is in Judah" <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/1-2.htm">Ezra 1:2-3</a>; and with the statement of Josephus, that he was moved thereto by  "reading the prophecy which Isaiah left, 210 years before."<p>It is, alas! nothing new to Christians to have mixed motives for their actions: the exception is to have a single motive, "for the glory of God." The advantage to himself would doubtless flash at once on the founder of a great empire, though it did not suggest the restoration of the Jews. Egypt and Assyria had always, on either side, wished to possess themselves of Palestine, which lay between them. Anyhow, one Persian monarch did restore the Jews; his successor possessed himself of "Egypt, and part, at least, of Ethiopia." Cyrus wished, it is related , "to war in person against Babylon, the Bactrians, the Sacae, and Egypt." He perished, as is known, before he had completed  the third of his purposed conquests. Cambyses, although after the conquest of Egypt he planned ill his two more distant expeditions, reduced  "the Ethiopians bordering upon Egypt" (  "lower Ethiopia and Nubia"), and these "brought gifts" permanently to the Persian Sovereign. Even in the time of Xerxes, the Ethiopians had to furnish their contingent of troops against the Greeks. Herodotus describes their dress and weapons, as they were reviewed at Doriscus . Cambyses, then, did not lose his hold over Ethiopia and Egypt, when forced by the rebellion of Pseudo-Smerdis to quit Egypt. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/zephaniah/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12.

Or, "as for ye Ethiopians also" (h); not the Ethiopians in Africa beyond Egypt, at a distance from the land of Israel, and the countries before mentioned; but the inhabitants of Arabia Chusea, or Ethiopia, which lay near to Moab and Ammon; these should not escape, but suffer with their neighbours, who sometimes distressed the people of the Jews, and made war with them, being nigh them; see <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-9.htm">2 Chronicles 14:9</a>, <p>ye shall be slain by my sword; or, "the slain of my sword are they" (i); R.

The Ethiopians are reckoned among the forces of Egypt (<a href="/2_chronicles/12-3.htm">2 Chronicles 12:3</a>; <a href="/nahum/3-9.htm">Nahum 3:9</a>, etc.). The prediction had a fulfilment when the Assyrians conquered Egypt, and again under Nebuchadnezzar. It shall have a more sublime accomplishment when the  sword of the Spirit shall reduce the utmost south to the dominion of Christ (see <a href="/isaiah/45-14.htm">Isaiah 45:14</a>; <a href="/psalms/68-31.htm">Psalm 68:31</a>). The commencement of this conversion is seen in the chamberlain of Queen Candace (<a href="/acts/8-27.htm">Acts 8:27</a>, etc.). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/micah/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>And even the best men form no exception to the rule. <a href="/micah/7-4.htm">Micah 7:4</a>. "Their best man is like a briar; the upright man more than a hedge: the day of thy spies, thy visitation cometh, then will their confusion follow. <a href="/micah/7-5.htm">Micah 7:5</a>. Trust not in the neighbour, rely not upon the intimate one; keep the doors of thy mouth before her that is thy bosom friend. <a href="/micah/7-6.htm">Micah 7:6</a>. For the son despiseth the father, the daughter rises up against her mother, the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; a man's enemies are the people of his own house." &#1496;&#1493;&#1489;&#1501;, the good man among them, i.e., the best man, resembles the thorn-bush, which only pricks, hurts, and injures. In &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; the force of the suffix still continues: the most righteous man among them; and &#1502;&#1503; before &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1492; is used in a comparative sense: "is more, i.e., worse, than a thorn-hedge." The corruption of the nation has reached such a terrible height, that the judgment must burst in upon them. This thought comes before the prophet's mind, so that he interrupts the description of the corrupt condition of things by pointing to the day of judgment. The "day of thy watch-men," i.e., of thy prophets (<a href="/jeremiah/6-17.htm">Jeremiah 6:17</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/3-17.htm">Ezekiel 3:17</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/33-7.htm">Ezekiel 33:7</a>), is explained in the apposition pequ&#774;dda&#770;thekha&#770; (thy visitation). The perfect &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1492; is prophetic of the future, which is as certain as if it were already there. &#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;, now, i.e., when this day has come (really therefore  equals  "then"), will their confusion be, i.e., then will the wildest confusion come upon them, as the evil, which now envelopes itself in the appearance of good, will then burst forth without shame and without restraint, and everything will be turned upside down. In the same sense as this Isaiah also calls the day of divine judgment a day of confusion (<a href="/isaiah/22-5.htm">Isaiah 22:5</a>). In the allusion to the day of judgment the speaker addresses the people, whereas in the description of the corruption he speaks of them. This distinction thus made between the person speaking and the people is not at variance with the assumption that the prophet speaks in the name of the congregation, any more than the words "thy watchmen, thy visitation," furnish an objection to the assumption that the prophet was one of the watchmen himself. This distinction simply proves that the penitential community is not identical with the mass of the people, but to be distinguished from them. In <a href="/micah/7-5.htm">Micah 7:5</a> the description of the moral corruption is continued, and that in the form of a warning not to trust one another any more, neither companion (&#1512;&#1506;) with whom one has intercourse in life, nor the confidential friend ('allu&#772;ph), nor the most intimate friend of all, viz., the wife lying on the husband's bosom. Even before her the husband was to beware of letting the secrets of his heart cross his lips, because she would betray them. The reason for this is assigned in <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/7-6.htm">Micah 7:6</a>, in the fact that even the holiest relations of the moral order of the world, the deepest ties of blood-relationship, are trodden under foot, and all the bonds of reverence, love, and chastity are loosened. The son treats his father as a fool (nibbe&#772;l, as in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-15.htm">Deuteronomy 32:15</a>). "The men of his house" (the subject of the last clause) are servants dwelling in the house, not relations (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/17-23.htm">Genesis 17:23</a>, <a href="/genesis/17-27.htm">Genesis 17:27</a>; <a href="/genesis/39-14.htm">Genesis 39:14</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-17.htm">2 Samuel 12:17-18</a>). This verse is applied by Christ to the period of the &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; which will attend His coming, in His instruction to the apostles in <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/10-35.htm">Matthew 10:35-36</a> (cf. <a href="/luke/12-53.htm">Luke 12:53</a>). It follows from this, that we have not to regard <a href="/micah/7-5.htm">Micah 7:5</a> and <a href="/micah/7-6.htm">Micah 7:6</a> as a simple continuation of the description in <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/7-2.htm">Micah 7:2-4</a>, but that these verses contain the explanation of &#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; &#1514;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492; &#1502;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1514;&#1501;, in this sense, that at the outbreak of the judgment and of the visitation the faithlessness will reach the height of treachery to the nearest friends, yea, even of the dissolution of every family tie (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/24-10.htm">Matthew 24:10</a>, <a href="/matthew/24-12.htm">Matthew 24:12</a>). </body></html>
