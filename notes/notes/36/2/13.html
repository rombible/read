Dr. Prideaux observes, that “Chyniladanus being king of the Assyrian and Babylonian empire, Nabopolassar, his general, took the latter from him, in the sixteenth year of Josiah; fourteen years after which Saraccus the king was slain, and Nineveh destroyed, which completed the fall of Assyria.” <span class="ital">And dry like a wilderness</span> — A multitude of people are often compared to, and called <span class="ital">waters, </span>in Scripture language; and therefore, figuratively speaking, to <span class="ital">make Nineveh dry like a wilderness, </span>may signify depopulating her. Or the words may be taken literally; for “Rauwolff observes, in his Travels, that on this side the river Tigris, in Mesopotamia, the ground is so sandy and dry, that you would think you were in the middle of the deserts of Arabia.” — <span class="ital">Prid.

For he shall uncover — </span>Or lay bare, <span class="ital">the cedar-work — </span>God will reduce the houses of Nineveh to such a state of desolation, that the floors and ceilings of cedar shall lie open to the injuries of the weather, and to birds to roost and build their nests there. “This reference” (in mentioning <span class="ital">cedar-work</span>) “to the former elegance of the city, is finely introduced; and, in the next verse, the grand and affecting description of her desolate state is beautifully contrasted, by her late festivity and pride.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/zephaniah/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:4-15 Those are really in a woful condition who have the word of the Lord against them, for no word of his shall fall to the ground. God will restore his people to their rights, though long kept from them. It has been the common lot of God's people, in all ages, to be reproached and reviled. God shall be worshipped, not only by all Israel, and the strangers who join them, but by the heathen. Remote nations must be reckoned with for the wrongs done to God's people. The sufferings of the insolent and haughty in prosperity, are unpitied and unlamented. But all the desolations of flourishing nations will make way for the overturning Satan's kingdom.

Judah had, in Zephaniah's time, nothing to fear from Assyria. Isaiah Isa 39:6 and Micah M<a href="/1_corinthians/4-10.htm">1 Corinthians 4:10</a> had already foretold, that the captivity would be to Babylon. Yet of Assyria alone the prophet, in his own person, expresses his own conformity with the mind of God. Of others he had said, "the word of the Lord is against you, O Canaan, and I will destroy thee; As I live, saith the Lord, Moab shall be as Sodom. Ye also, O Ethiopians, the, slain of My sword are they." Of Assyria alone, by a slight inflection of the word, he expresses that he goes along with this, which he announces.<p>He does not say as an imprecation, "May He stretch forth His hand;" but gently, as continuing his prophecies, "and," joining on Asshur with the rest; only instead of saying "He will stretch forth," by a form almost insulated in Hebrew, he says, "And stretch He forth His Hand." In a way not unlike, David having declared God's judgments, "The Lord trieth the righteous; and the wicked and the lover of violence doth His soul abhor, subjoineth, On the wicked rain He snares," signifying that he (as all must be in the Day of judgment), is at one with the judgment of God. This is the last sentence upon Nineveh, enforcing that of Jonah and Nahum, yet without place of repentance now. He accumulates words expressive of desolateness. It should not only be a "desolation" <a href="//biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-4.htm">Zephaniah 2:4</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-9.htm">Zephaniah 2:9</a>, as he had said of Ashkelon, Moab and Amman, but a dry, parched , unfruitful <a href="/isaiah/53-2.htm">Isaiah 53:2</a> land. As Isaiah, under the same words, prophesies that the dry and desolate land should, by the Gospel, be glad, so the gladness of the world should become dryness and desolation. Asshur is named, as though one individual , implying the entireness of the destruction; all shall perish as one man; or as gathered into one and dependent upon one, its evil King. "The north" is not only Assyria, in that its armies came upon Judah from the north, but it stands for the whole power of evil (see <a href="/isaiah/14-13.htm">Isaiah 14:13</a>), as Nineveh for the whole beautiful, evil, world. The world with "the princes of this world" shall perish together. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/zephaniah/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. Here he passes suddenly to the north. Nineveh was destroyed by Cyaxares and Nabopolassar, 625 B.C. The Scythian hordes, by an inroad into Media and thence in the southwest of Asia (thought by many to be the forces described by Zephaniah, as the invaders of Judea, rather than the Chaldeans), for a while interrupted Cyaxares' operations; but he finally succeeded. Arbaces and Belesis previously subverted the Assyrian empire under Sardanapalus (that is, Pul?), 877 B.C.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/zephaniah/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">And he, </span> the Lord God of Israel, or the Chaldean monarch as God’s servant herein, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">will stretch out his hand, </span> engage all his power, and use it to the utmost, against the north, i.e. as follows, Assyria, which lay northward of Judea, but more due north from Babylon, if I mistake not. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Destroy Assyria; </span> overthrow that great and ancient kingdom of Assyria. of which more at large in Nahum.

Though this country lay to the northeast of Palestine, its armies attacked from the north, and it is generally represented as a northern power. Its destruction was foretold (<a href="/isaiah/10-12.htm">Isaiah 10:12</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/31-11.htm">Ezekiel 31:11</a>, etc.; <a href="/nahum/1-14.htm">Nahum 1:14</a>, etc.).

Assyria was greatly indebted for its remarkable fertility to a very successful system of artificial irrigation, and when this was not maintained, great tracts soon relapsed into a wilderness (Layard, 'Nineveh,' 2:68). "Cultivation," says Professor Rawlinson, "is now the exception instead of the rule. 'Instead of the luxuriant fields, the groves and gardens of former times, nothing now meets the eye but an arid waste' (Chesny). Large tracts are covered by unwholesome marshes, producing nothing but enormous reeds; others lie waste and bare, parched up by the fierce heat of the sun, and utterly destitute of water; in some places sand drifts accumulate, and threaten to make the whole region a mere portion of the desert" ('Anc. Men.,' 1:41). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/micah/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>And even the best men form no exception to the rule. <a href="/micah/7-4.htm">Micah 7:4</a>. "Their best man is like a briar; the upright man more than a hedge: the day of thy spies, thy visitation cometh, then will their confusion follow. <a href="/micah/7-5.htm">Micah 7:5</a>. Trust not in the neighbour, rely not upon the intimate one; keep the doors of thy mouth before her that is thy bosom friend. <a href="/micah/7-6.htm">Micah 7:6</a>. For the son despiseth the father, the daughter rises up against her mother, the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; a man's enemies are the people of his own house." &#1496;&#1493;&#1489;&#1501;, the good man among them, i.e., the best man, resembles the thorn-bush, which only pricks, hurts, and injures. In &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; the force of the suffix still continues: the most righteous man among them; and &#1502;&#1503; before &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1492; is used in a comparative sense: "is more, i.e., worse, than a thorn-hedge." The corruption of the nation has reached such a terrible height, that the judgment must burst in upon them. This thought comes before the prophet's mind, so that he interrupts the description of the corrupt condition of things by pointing to the day of judgment. The "day of thy watch-men," i.e., of thy prophets (<a href="/jeremiah/6-17.htm">Jeremiah 6:17</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/3-17.htm">Ezekiel 3:17</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/33-7.htm">Ezekiel 33:7</a>), is explained in the apposition pequ&#774;dda&#770;thekha&#770; (thy visitation). The perfect &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1492; is prophetic of the future, which is as certain as if it were already there. &#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;, now, i.e., when this day has come (really therefore  equals  "then"), will their confusion be, i.e., then will the wildest confusion come upon them, as the evil, which now envelopes itself in the appearance of good, will then burst forth without shame and without restraint, and everything will be turned upside down. In the same sense as this Isaiah also calls the day of divine judgment a day of confusion (<a href="/isaiah/22-5.htm">Isaiah 22:5</a>). In the allusion to the day of judgment the speaker addresses the people, whereas in the description of the corruption he speaks of them. This distinction thus made between the person speaking and the people is not at variance with the assumption that the prophet speaks in the name of the congregation, any more than the words "thy watchmen, thy visitation," furnish an objection to the assumption that the prophet was one of the watchmen himself. This distinction simply proves that the penitential community is not identical with the mass of the people, but to be distinguished from them. In <a href="/micah/7-5.htm">Micah 7:5</a> the description of the moral corruption is continued, and that in the form of a warning not to trust one another any more, neither companion (&#1512;&#1506;) with whom one has intercourse in life, nor the confidential friend ('allu&#772;ph), nor the most intimate friend of all, viz., the wife lying on the husband's bosom. Even before her the husband was to beware of letting the secrets of his heart cross his lips, because she would betray them. The reason for this is assigned in <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/7-6.htm">Micah 7:6</a>, in the fact that even the holiest relations of the moral order of the world, the deepest ties of blood-relationship, are trodden under foot, and all the bonds of reverence, love, and chastity are loosened. The son treats his father as a fool (nibbe&#772;l, as in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-15.htm">Deuteronomy 32:15</a>). "The men of his house" (the subject of the last clause) are servants dwelling in the house, not relations (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/17-23.htm">Genesis 17:23</a>, <a href="/genesis/17-27.htm">Genesis 17:27</a>; <a href="/genesis/39-14.htm">Genesis 39:14</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-17.htm">2 Samuel 12:17-18</a>). This verse is applied by Christ to the period of the &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; which will attend His coming, in His instruction to the apostles in <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/10-35.htm">Matthew 10:35-36</a> (cf. <a href="/luke/12-53.htm">Luke 12:53</a>). It follows from this, that we have not to regard <a href="/micah/7-5.htm">Micah 7:5</a> and <a href="/micah/7-6.htm">Micah 7:6</a> as a simple continuation of the description in <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/7-2.htm">Micah 7:2-4</a>, but that these verses contain the explanation of &#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; &#1514;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492; &#1502;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1514;&#1501;, in this sense, that at the outbreak of the judgment and of the visitation the faithlessness will reach the height of treachery to the nearest friends, yea, even of the dissolution of every family tie (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/24-10.htm">Matthew 24:10</a>, <a href="/matthew/24-12.htm">Matthew 24:12</a>). </body></html>
