A nation not desiring, that has not desires toward God, is not desirous of his favour and grace, has no mind to repent and reform. Or, not desirable, not having any thing to recommend them to God; to whom God might justly say, Depart from me; but he says, Gather together to me that you may seek my face. We know what God's decree will bring against impenitent sinners, therefore it highly concerns all to repent in the accepted time. How careful should we all be to seek peace with God, before the Holy Spirit withdraws from us, or ceases to strive with us; before the day of grace is over, or the day of life; before our everlasting state is determined! Let the poor, despised, and afflicted, seek the Lord, and seek to understand and keep his commandments better, that they may be more humbled for their sins. The chief hope of deliverance from national judgments rests upon prayer.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/zephaniah/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Before the decree bring forth - God's word is full (as it were) of the event which it foretelleth; it contains its own fulfillment in itself, and "travaileth" until it come to pass, giving signs of its coming, yet delaying until the full time. Time is said to bring forth what is wrought in it. "Thou knowest not, what a day shall bring forth."<p>Before the day pass as the chaff - Or, parenthetically, "like chaff the day passeth by." God's counsels lie wrapt up, as it were, in the womb of time, wherein He hides them, until the moment which He has appointed, and they break forth suddenly to those who look not for them. The mean season is given for repentance, that is, the day of grace, the span of repentance still allowed, which is continually whirling more swiftly by; and woe, if it be fruitless as chaff! Those who profit not by it shall also be as chaff, carried away pitilessly by the whirlwind to destruction. Time, on which eternity hangs, is a slight, uncertain thing, as little to be counted upon, as the light dry particles which are the sport of the wind, driven uncertainly here and there. But when it is "passed," then "cometh," not "to" them, but "upon" them, from heaven, overwhelming them, "abiding upon" <a href="/john/3-36.htm">John 3:36</a> them, not to pass away, "the heat of the anger of Almighty God." This warning he twice repeats, to impress the certainty and speed of its conming <a href="/genesis/41-32.htm">Genesis 41:32</a>.

Maurer puts it parenthetically, "the day (that is, time) passes as the chaff (that is, most quickly)." Calvin, "before the decree bring forth" (the predicted vengeance), (then) the chaff (the Jews) shall pass in a day, that is, in a moment, though they thought that it would be long before they could be overthrown.

Which was like a woman big with child, ready to be delivered. The decree of God concerning the people of the Jews was pregnant with wrath and ruin for their sins, and just ripe for execution; and therefore, before it was actually executed, they are exhorted as above; not that the decree of God which was gone forth could be frustrated and made void by anything done by them; only that, when it was put into execution, such as repented of their sins might be saved from the general calamity; which they are called upon to do before the day come appointed by the Lord for the execution of this decree; which lingered not, and was not delayed, but slid on as swiftly as chaff before the driving wind. There is some difficulty in the rendering and sense of these words; some thus, "before the day, which passes as chaff, brings forth the decree" (e); that is, before the time, which moves swiftly, brings on the execution of the decree, or of the thing decreed in it, it is big with: others, "before the decree brings forth the day that passeth as chaff" (f); or in which the chaff shall be separated from the wheat, pass away, be dispersed here and there; that is, before they were scattered about by it as chaff: and to this sense the Septuagint and Arabic versions, "before ye are as a flower"; or, as the Syriac, "as chaff that passeth away"; and so the Targum more fully, <p>"before the decree of the house of judgment come out upon you, and ye be like chaff which the wind blows away, and like a shadow which passes from before the day.'' See <a href="/psalms/1-4.htm">Psalm 1:4</a>. <p>Before the fierce anger of the Lord come upon you, before the day of the Lord's anger come upon you; these phrases explain the former, and show what the decree was big with, and ready to bring forth, even the judgments of God, in wrath and fierce anger; and what the day is, said to pass as the chaff; the day of God's vengeance fixed by him, which should come upon them, and scatter them like chaff among the nations of the world: or rather the words may be rendered thus, as by Gussetius (g), "whilst as yet the decree hath not brought forth, the day passeth away like chaff"; being neglected and spent in an useless and unprofitable manner; for which they are reproved; and therefore are exhorted to be wiser for the future, and redeem precious time; and, before the Lord's anger comes upon them, do what is before exhorted to, and particularly what follows: <p>(e)  "antequam dies, quae transit ut palea, pariat decretum", Drusius; so Ben Melech.

"The day" must be still the day of the Lord, not the day of life or the day of repentance. God brings on the judgment as easily and as quickly as the wind carries the chaff before it.

And Jerome gives, "Priusquam pariat jussio quasi pulverem transeuntem diem," "Before the decree beget the day which passeth by like the dust." The present Hebrew text does not confirm these versions. The figure of the chaff is common (see <a href="/job/21-18.htm">Job 21:18</a>; <a href="/isaiah/17-13.htm">Isaiah 17:13</a>; <a href="/isaiah/29-5.htm">Isaiah 29:5</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/micah/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The threatening words commence in <a href="/micah/6-10.htm">Micah 6:10</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/6-10.htm">Micah 6:10-12</a> containing a condemnation of the prevailing sins. <a href="/micah/6-10.htm">Micah 6:10</a>. "Are there yet in the house of the unjust treasures of injustice, and the ephah of consumption, the cursed one? <a href="/micah/6-11.htm">Micah 6:11</a>. Can I be clean with the scale of injustice, and with a purse with stones of deceit? <a href="/micah/6-12.htm">Micah 6:12</a>. That their rich men are full of wickedness, and their inhabitants speak deceit, and their tongue is falseness in their mouth." The reproof is dressed up in the form of a question. In the question in <a href="/micah/6-10.htm">Micah 6:10</a> the emphasis is laid upon the &#1506;&#1493;&#1491;, which stands for that very reason before the interrogative particle, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/19-12.htm">Genesis 19:12</a>, the only other place in which this occurs. &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;, a softened form for &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, as in <a href="/2_samuel/14-19.htm">2 Samuel 14:19</a>. Treasures of wickedness are treasures acquired through wickedness or acts of injustice. The meaning of the question is not, Are the unjust treasures not yet removed out of the house, not yet distributed again? but, as <a href="/micah/6-10.htm">Micah 6:10</a> and <a href="/micah/6-11.htm">Micah 6:11</a> require, Does the wicked man still bring such treasures into the house? does he still heap up such treasures in his house? The question is affirmative, and the form of a question is chosen to sharpen the conscience, as the unjust men to whom it is addressed cannot deny it. &#1488;&#1497;&#1508;&#1514; &#1512;&#1494;&#1493;&#1503;, ephah of consumption or hungriness, analogous to the German expression "a hungry purse," is too small an ephah (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/25-14.htm">Deuteronomy 25:14</a>; <a href="/amos/8-5.htm">Amos 8:5</a>); the opposite of &#1488; &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1502;&#1492; (<a href="/deuteronomy/25-15.htm">Deuteronomy 25:15</a>) or &#1488; &#1510;&#1491;&#1511; (<a href="/leviticus/19-36.htm">Leviticus 19:36</a>), which the law prescribed. Hence Micah calls it &#1494;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492;  equals  &#1494;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; in <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/22-14.htm">Proverbs 22:14</a>, that which is smitten by the wrath of God (equivalent to cursed; cf. <a href="/numbers/23-7.htm">Numbers 23:7</a>; <a href="/proverbs/24-24.htm">Proverbs 24:24</a>). Whoever has not a full ephah is, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/25-16.htm">Deuteronomy 25:16</a>, an abomination to the Lord. If these questions show the people that they do not answer to the demands made by the Lord in <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>, the questions in <a href="/micah/6-11.htm">Micah 6:11</a> also teach that, with this state of things, they cannot hold themselves guiltless. The speaker inquires, from the standpoint of his own moral consciousness, whether he can be pure, i.e., guiltless, if he uses deceitful scales and weights, - a question to which every one must answer No. It is difficult, however, to decide who the questioner is. As <a href="/micah/6-9.htm">Micah 6:9</a> announces words of God, and in <a href="/micah/6-10.htm">Micah 6:10</a> God is speaking, and also in <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/6-12.htm">Micah 6:12</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/6-13.htm">Micah 6:13</a>, it appears as though Jehovah must be the questioner here. But &#1488;&#1494;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492; does not tally with this. Jerome therefore adopts the rendering numquid justificabo stateram impiam; but &#1494;&#1499;&#1492; in the kal has only the meaning to be pure, and even in the piel it is not used in the sense of niqqh, to acquit. This latter fact is sufficient to overthrow the proposal to alter the reading into piel. Moreover, "the context requires the thought that the rich men fancy they can be pure with deceitful weights, and a refutation of this delusive idea" (Caspari). Consequently the prophet only can raise this question, namely as the representative of the moral consciousness; and we must interpret this transition, which is so sudden and abrupt to our ears, by supplying the thought, "Let every one ask himself," Can I, etc. Instead of &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; we have the more definite mirmh in the parallel clause. Scales and a bag with stones belong together; 'a&#774;bhan&#305;&#772;m are the stone weights (cf. <a href="/leviticus/19-36.htm">Leviticus 19:36</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/25-13.htm">Deuteronomy 25:13</a>) which were carried in a bag (<a href="/proverbs/16-11.htm">Proverbs 16:11</a>). In <a href="/micah/6-12.htm">Micah 6:12</a> the condemnation of injustice is widened still further. Whereas in the first clause the rich men of the capital (the suffix pointing back to &#1506;&#1497;&#1512; in <a href="/micah/6-9.htm">Micah 6:9</a>), who are also to be thought of in <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/6-10.htm">Micah 6:10</a>, are expressly mentioned, in the second clause the inhabitants generally are referred to. And whilst the rich are not only charged with injustice or fraud in trade, but with cha&#770;ma&#770;s, violence of every kind, the inhabitants are charged with lying and deceit of the tongue. Lesho&#772;na&#770;m (their tongue) is not placed at the head absolutely, in the sense of "As for their tongue, deceit is," etc. Such an emphasis as this is precluded by the fact that the preceding clause, "speaking lies," involves the use of the tongue. Lesho&#772;na&#770;m is the simple subject: Their tongue is deceit or falsehood in their mouth; i.e., their tongue is so full of deceit, that it is, so to speak, resolved into it. Both clauses express the thought, that "the inhabitants of Jerusalem are a population of liars and cheats" (Hitzig). The connection in which the verse stands, or the true explanation of &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, has been a matter of dispute. We must reject both the combination of <a href="/micah/6-12.htm">Micah 6:12</a> and <a href="/micah/6-13.htm">Micah 6:13</a> ("Because their rich men, etc., therefore I also," etc.), and also the assumption that <a href="/micah/6-12.htm">Micah 6:12</a> contains the answer to the question in <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/6-10.htm">Micah 6:10</a>, and that &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; precedes the direct question (Hitzig): the former, because <a href="/micah/6-12.htm">Micah 6:12</a> obviously forms the conclusion to the reproof, and must be separated from what precedes it; the latter, because the question in <a href="/micah/6-11.htm">Micah 6:11</a> stands between <a href="/micah/6-10.htm">Micah 6:10</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/6-12.htm">Micah 6:12</a>, which is closely connected with <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/6-10.htm">Micah 6:10</a>, and <a href="/micah/6-12.htm">Micah 6:12</a> also contains no answer to <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/6-10.htm">Micah 6:10</a>, so far as the thought is concerned, even if the latter actually required an answer. We must rather take &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; as a relative, as Caspari does, and understand the verse as an exclamation, which the Lord utters in anger over the city: "She, whose rich men are full," etc. "Angry persons generally prefer to speak of those who have excited their wrath, instead of addressing their words to them." </body></html>
