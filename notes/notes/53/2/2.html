for the “driving out of their wits” is regarded as a single act; the “agitation,” or being troubled, as a chronic condition, into which there was fear of their falling. This shaking and trouble probably brought about the disorders spoken of in 2 Thessalonians 3. The instruments by which men had partly driven the Thessalonians out of their wits already were three:—(1) “Through spirit,” <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>by pretended manifestations of the Holy Spirit’s power, whether through false signs or, more probably, through “prophesyings.” (See <a href="/context/1_thessalonians/5-20.htm" title="Despise not prophesyings.">1Thessalonians 5:20-22</a>, where the fear of some abuse of prophecy is clearly marked already.) (2) “Through word,” <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>Word of mouth, as opposed to the written letter next mentioned. Most modern commentators seem rightly to take the words “as from us” with this clause as well as with the next; some persons misrepresented what they had heard the Apostles say on the topic, or pretended to have been intrusted with a message from them. (3) “Through letter;” apparently forged letters, purporting to be from (or, literally, <span class= "ital">through</span>) St. Paul, had been circulated. (See Note on <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-17.htm" title="The salutation of Paul with my own hand, which is the token in every letter: so I write.">2Thessalonians 3:17</a>.) “Word” and “letter” occur again in <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-15.htm" title="Therefore, brothers, stand fast, and hold the traditions which you have been taught, whether by word, or our letter.">2Thessalonians 2:15</a> as his ordinary means of teaching.<p><span class= "bld">As that the day of Christ is at hand</span>—<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, “to the effect that it is, ”—giving the contents of the pretended revelation; for “as that” follows grammatically upon “spirit, word, letter,” not upon “shaken, troubled.” The word for “is at hand” implies a very close proximity indeed, the participle, in fact (like our word “instant”), being used for “present,” <span class= "ital">e.g., </span><a href="/galatians/1-4.htm" title="Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father:">Galatians 1:4</a>. Probably the form which the false doctrine at Thessalonica was beginning to take was that the day of the Lord had already set in, thus confusing the whole idea of a personal, visible Advent, just as, at a later period, Hymenæus and Philetus confused the true doctrine of resurrection by affirming that it was already past (<a href="/2_timothy/2-18.htm" title="Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some.">2Timothy 2:18</a>). St. Paul not only denies vigorously that the day is come, but proceeds in the next verse to show that the signs of its approach are not yet exhibited. The best reading gives “the day of <span class= "ital">the Lord,” </span>not “of Christ.” (See Note on <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-2.htm" title="For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so comes as a thief in the night.">1Thessalonians 5:2</a>.)<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_thessalonians/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:1-4 If errors arise among Christians, we should set them right; and good men will be careful to suppress errors which rise from mistaking their words and actions. We have a cunning adversary, who watches to do mischief, and will promote errors, even by the words of Scripture. Whatever uncertainty we are in, or whatever mistakes may arise about the time of Christ's coming, that coming itself is certain. This has been the faith and hope of all Christians, in all ages of the church; it was the faith and hope of the Old Testament saints. All believers shall be gathered together to Christ, to be with him, and to be happy in his presence for ever. We should firmly believe the second coming of Christ; but there was danger lest the Thessalonians, being mistaken as to the time, should question the truth or certainty of the thing itself. False doctrines are like the winds that toss the water to and fro; and they unsettle the minds of men, which are as unstable as water. It is enough for us to know that our Lord will come, and will gather all his saints unto him. A reason why they should not expect the coming of Christ, as at hand, is given. There would be a general falling away first, such as would occasion the rise of antichrist, that man of sin. There have been great disputes who or what is intended by this man of sin and son of perdition. The man of sin not only practises wickedness, but also promotes and commands sin and wickedness in others; and is the son of perdition, because he is devoted to certain destruction, and is the instrument to destroy many others, both in soul and body. As God was in the temple of old, and worshipped there, and is in and with his church now; so the antichrist here mentioned, is a usurper of God's authority in the Christian church, who claims Divine honours.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_thessalonians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That ye be not soon shaken in mind - The word here used signifies, properly, to be moved as a wave of the sea, or to be tossed upon the waves, as a vessel is. Then it means to be shaken in any way; see <a href="/matthew/11-7.htm">Matthew 11:7</a>; <a href="/matthew/24-29.htm">Matthew 24:29</a>; <a href="/luke/6-38.htm">Luke 6:38</a>; <a href="/acts/4-31.htm">Acts 4:31</a>; <a href="/hebrews/12-26.htm">Hebrews 12:26</a>. The reference here is to the agitation or alarm felt from the belief that the day of judgment would soon occur. It is uniformly said in the Scriptures, that the approach of the Lord Jesus to judge the world, will produce a great consternation and alarm. <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/24-30.htm">Matthew 24:30</a>, "then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven, and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn." <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/1-7.htm">Revelation 1:7</a>, "behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him and they also which pierced him; and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him." <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/23-30.htm">Luke 23:30</a>, "then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills Cover us;" compare <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/2-21.htm">Isaiah 2:21-22</a>.<p>Of the truth of this, there can be no doubt. We may imagine something of the effects which will be produced by the alarm caused in a community when a belief prevails that the day of judgment is near. In a single year (1843) 17 persons were admitted to the Lunatic Asylum in Worcester, Mass., who had become deranged in consequence of the expectation that the Lord Jesus was about to appear. It is easy to account for such facts, and no doubt, when the Lord Jesus shall actually come, the effect on the guilty world will be overwhelming. The apostle here says, also, that those who were Christians were "shaken in mind and troubled" by this anticipation. There are, doubtless, many true Christians who would be alarmed at such an event, as there are many who, like Hezekiah <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/38-1.htm">Isaiah 38:1-2</a>, are alarmed at the prospect of death. Many real Christians might, on the sudden occurrence of such an event, feel that they were not prepared, and be alarmed at the prospect of passing through the great trial which is to determine their everlasting destiny. It is no certain evidence of a want of piety to be alarmed at the approach of death. Our nature dreads death, and though there may be a well-founded hope of heaven, it will not always preserve a delicate physical frame from trembling when it comes.<p>Or be troubled - That is, disturbed, or terrified. It would seem that this belief had produced much consternation among them.<p>Neither by spirit - By any pretended spirit of prophecy. But whether this refers to the predictions of those who were false prophets in Thessalonica, or to something which it was alleged the apostle Paul had himself said there, and which was construed as meaning that the time was near, is not certain. This depends much on the question whether the phrase "as from us," refers only to the letters which had been sent to them, or also to the "word" and to the "spirit," here spoken of; see Oldshausen on the place. It would seem, from the connection, that all their consternation had been caused by some misconstruction which had been put on the sentiments of Paul himself, for if there had been any other source of alarm, he would naturally have referred to it. It is probable, therefore, that allusion is made to some representation which had been given of what he had said under the influence of the Holy Spirit, and that the expectation that the end of the world was near, was supposed to be a doctrine of inspiration. Whether, however, the Thessalonians themselves put this construction on what he said, or whether those who had caused the alarm represented him as teaching this, cannot be determined.<p>Nor by word - That is, by public instruction, or in preaching. It is evident that when the apostle was among them, this subject, from such causes, was prominent in his discourses; see <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-5.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:5</a>. It had been inferred, it seems, from what he said, that he meant to teach that the end of the world was near.<p>Nor by letter - Either the one which he had before written to them - the First Epistle to the Thessalonians - or one which had been forged in his name. "As from us." That is, Paul, Silas, and Timothy, who are united in writing the two epistles <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/1-1.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:1</a>, and in whose names a letter would be forged, if one of this description were sent to them. It has been made a question, whether the apostle refers here to the former epistle which he had sent to them, or to a forged letter; and on this question critics have been about equally divided. The reasons for the former opinion may be seen in Paley's Herin Paulinae, in loc. The question is not very important, and perhaps cannot be easily settled. There are two or three circumstances, however, which seem to make it probable that he refers to an epistle which had been forged, and which had been pretended to be received from him. (1.) one is found in the expression "as from us." If he had referred to his own former letter, it seems to me that the allusion would have been more distinct, and that the particle "as" (&#x3c9;&#788;&#x3c2;  ho&#772;s) would not have been used. This is such an expression as would have been employed if the reference were to such a forged letter.<p>(2) a second circumstance is found in the expression in the next verse, "Let no man deceive you by any means," which looks as if they were not led into this belief by their own interpretation of his former epistle, but by a deliberate attempt of some one to delude them on the subject.<p>(3) perhaps a third circumstance would be found in the fact that it was not uncommon in early times of Christianity to attempt to impose forged writings on the churches. Nothing would be more natural for an impostor who wished to acquire influence, than to do this; and that it was often done is well known. That epistles were forged under the names of the apostles, appears very probable, as Benson has remarked, from chap. <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-17.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:17</a>; <a href="/galatians/6-11.htm">Galatians 6:11</a>; and Plm 1:19. There are, indeed, none of those forged epistles extant which were composed in the time of the apostles, but there is extant an epistle of Paul to the Corinthians, besides the two which we have; another to the Laodiceans, and six of Paul's epistles to Seneca - all of which are undoubted forgeries; see Benson in loc. If Paul, however, here refers to his former epistle, the reference is doubtless to <a href="//biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-15.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:15</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:2-4</a>, which might easily be understood as teaching that the end of the world was near, and to which those who maintained that opinion might appeal with great plausibility. We have, however, the authority of the apostle himself that he meant to teach no such thing. "As that the day of Christ is at hand." The time when he would appear - called "the day of Christ," because it would be appointed especially for the manifestation of his glory. The phrase "at hand," means near. Grotius supposes that it denotes that same year, and refers for proof to <a href="/romans/8-38.htm">Romans 8:38</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/3-22.htm">1 Corinthians 3:22</a>; <a href="/galatians/1-4.htm">Galatians 1:4</a>. <a href="/hebrews/9-9.htm">Hebrews 9:9</a>. If so, the attempt to fix the day was an early indication of the desire to determine the very time of his appearing - a disposition which has been so common since, and which has led into so many sad mistakes. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_thessalonians/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. soon&#8212;on trifling grounds, without due consideration.<p>shaken&#8212;literally, "tossed" as ships tossed by an agitated sea.

Christ and His apostles always taught that the day of the Lord's coming is at hand; and it is not likely that Paul would imply anything contrary here; what he denies is, that it is so immediately imminent, instant, or present, as to justify the neglect of everyday worldly duties. Chrysostom, and after him Alford, translates, "is (already) present" (compare 2Ti 2:18), a kindred error. But in 2Ti 3:1, the same Greek verb is translated "come." Wahl supports this view. The Greek is usually used of actual presence; but is quite susceptible of the translation, "is all but present."<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_thessalonians/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">That ye be not soon shaken in mind; </span> saleuyhnai it is an allusion to the waves of the sea that are tossed with the winds, as false doctrines tend to unsettle the mind, as <span class="bld"><a href="/ephesians/4-14.htm" title="That we from now on be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive;">Ephesians 4:14</a> <a href="/hebrews/13-9.htm" title="Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines.

It denotes the <span class="ital">reasonable, sober, and considerate state of mind</span>, mentis tranquillitas (Turretin). Others, contrary to the meaning of the word, understand by <span class="greekheb">νοῦς</span> the more correct <span class="ital">view</span> or <span class="ital">conviction</span>, received by the personal instruction of the apostle <span class="ital">concerning the advent</span>, from which the Thessalonians were not to suffer themselves to be removed. So Hemming, Bullinger, Estius, Lucius Osiander, Piscator, Cornelius a Lapide, Grotius, Fromond., Bern. a Piconius, Nat.

T. 611].<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">μήτε διὰ πνεύματος</span>] <span class="ital">neither by inspiration</span>. Falsely-understood prophecies of the O. T. (Krause), or signa quasi per spiritum facta (Pelagius), or deceitful revelations by spiritual appearances (Ernest Schmid, Schrader), or by dreams (Schrader), are not meant; but inspired prophetical discourses, delivered by the members of the church in Christian assemblies, and whose contents were falsely given out as divine revelations. To understand, with Chrysostom, Bugenhagen, Vatablus, Koppe, Storr, Bolten, Heydenreich, and others (Flatt and de Wette give the alternative), <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span> as an abstract noun, instead of the concrete <span class="greekheb">πνευματικός</span>, so that the persons who delivered the inspired discourses are to be understood, although not without analogy, is yet objectionable in itself, and has the want of harmony occasioned by it with the following <span class="greekheb">λόγου</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἐπιστολῆς</span> against it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">μήτε διὰ λόγου</span>] is by Baumgarten-Crusius referred to a traditional (falsified) word of Jesus, more specifically by Noesselt to the prophecy of Christ in Matthew 24, Mark 13, Luke 21. But if Paul had in view a saying of <span class="ital">Christ</span>, he would have <span class="ital">indicated</span> it (perhaps by <span class="greekheb">μήτε διὰ λόγου ὡς κυρίου</span>, or something similar). Others, as Michaelis and Tychsen, translate <span class="greekheb">λόγος</span> by “reckoning,” and suppose that one made a reckoning of the times on the ground of the Book of Daniel, and in consequence inferred that the advent of Christ was directly at hand. But <span class="greekheb">λόγου</span> <span class="ital">by itself</span> certainly does not justify such an artificial hypothesis. Lastly, others, in distinction from prophecy delivered by inspiration, take <span class="greekheb">λόγος</span> in the sense of a calm and didactic discourse, whether aiming at conviction or seduction. So, after the example of Chrysostom, Oecumenius (<span class="greekheb">διὰ πιθανολογίας</span>), Theophylact (<span class="greekheb">διὰ διδασκαλίας ζώσῃ φωνῇ γινομένης</span>), Clarius (oratione persuasoria), Zeger (per doctrinam viva voce prolatam), Ewald (“by word; that is, by discourse and doctrine [<span class="greekheb">διδαχή</span>, <a href="/1_corinthians/14-26.htm" title="How is it then, brothers? when you come together, every one of you has a psalm, has a doctrine, has a tongue, has a revelation, has an interpretation. Let all things be done to edifying.">1 Corinthians 14:26</a>]; whilst one sought to prove the error in a learned manner by a clever discourse, perhaps from the Holy Scriptures”), Hofmann, Riggenbach, and many others. However, from the parallel arrangement in <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-15.htm" title="Therefore, brothers, stand fast, and hold the traditions which you have been taught, whether by word, or our letter.">2 Thessalonians 2:15</a>, which opposes the true to the false expressed in <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-2.htm" title="That you be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand.">2 Thessalonians 2:2</a>, it is evident that <span class="greekheb">διὰ λόγου</span> and <span class="greekheb">διʼ ἐπιστολῆς</span> are closely connected ideas, of which the first denotes the oral, and the second the written statement. It is accordingly most natural to construe <span class="greekheb">διὰ λόγου</span> not by itself, but to unite <span class="greekheb">ὡς διʼ ἡμῶν</span>, <span class="ital">as proceeding from us</span>, both with <span class="greekheb">διὰ λόγου</span> and with <span class="greekheb">διʼ ἐπιστολῆς</span>; and to understand the first of <span class="ital">oral</span> expressions which were imputed to the apostle,[43] and the latter of <span class="ital">written</span> expressions which were imputed to him by means of a forged epistle. On the other hand, with Erasmus, to refer <span class="greekheb">ὡς διʼ ἡμῶν</span> also to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΙᾺ ΠΝΕΎΜΑΤΟς</span></span></span> is impossible; as, although <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΛΌΓΟΙ</span></span></span> and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΠΙΣΤΟΛΑΊ</span></span></span> may be placed in the category of those things which proceed from one absent, yet this cannot be the case with inspired prophetical discourses, as with these the personal presence of the speaker was requisite.

The cry was, <span class="greekheb">ὁ κύριος πάρεστι</span>. The final period had already begun, and the Thessalonians were probably referred to their sufferings as a proof of this.

Possibly Paul imagined an epistle had been forged purporting to come from him or his companions, but we have no means of knowing whether his suspicion was well-founded or not. In any case the allusion is quite credible within his lifetime. Such expectations may have been excited in a more or less innocent fashion, but Paul peremptorily (<a href="/2_thessalonians/2-3.htm" title="Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;">2 Thessalonians 2:3</a>) ranks them all as dishonest; he is concerned not with their origin but with their mischievous effects upon the church (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/matthew/24-4.htm" title="And Jesus answered and said to them, Take heed that no man deceive you.">Matthew 24:4</a>). Probably his suspicions of misinterpretation were due to his recent experiences in Galatia, though the Macedonian churches seem to have escaped any infusion of the anti-Pauline propaganda which soured Corinth not long afterwards.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/2_thessalonians/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2</span>. <span class="ital">that ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled</span>] Lit., <span class="bld">to the end that ye be not quickly shaken from your mind</span> (R. V.):—more freely rendered: <span class="bld">we beseech you … not to lose your balance of mind under any sudden shock</span>; or keeping nearer to the Greek, <span class="bld">not to be shaken out of your wits</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Quickly” points, as probably in <a href="/galatians/1-6.htm" title="I marvel that you are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ to another gospel:">Galatians 1:6</a>, to the <span class="ital">speedy effect</span> of the disturbing cause. Starting declarations were made about the Second Advent; the Thessalonians must take care that they are not carried away by them. Let them resist the first impression of these sensational announcements, and put them to the test of cool judgement and enquiry, as men who “prove all things” (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-21.htm" title="Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.">1 Thessalonians 5:21</a>); they will find out how baseless they really are.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">nor yet</span>, he continues, <span class="bld">be kept in alarm</span>. The former clause describes the overthrow of one’s mental equilibrium; this deprecates a continued agitation, a nervous, fluttered condition of mind. The word occurs in the like connection in <a href="/matthew/24-6.htm" title="And you shall hear of wars and rumors of wars: see that you be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet.">Matthew 24:6</a>; <a href="/mark/13-7.htm" title="And when you shall hear of wars and rumors of wars, be you not troubled: for such things must needs be; but the end shall not be yet.">Mark 13:7</a> : “When ye shall hear of wars, &c., <span class="ital">be not troubled</span>”—i.e. <span class="ital">alarmed, discomposed</span>. From the words that follow it is evident that various attempts were made to disturb the Church upon this subject; and while some would be startled at once out of their self-possession, others, less excitable, would still by the recurrence of the rumours be kept in perturbation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us</span>] There is a contrast in the Greek between the two states of mind just referred to (<span class="ital">shaken, nor yet troubled</span>), but not between the various means by which they were produced; for the latter were used not as alternatives, but in combination. Hence the R. V. renders: <span class="bld">either by spirit, or by word, or by epistle as from us</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The import of the phrase “by spirit” is apparent from <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-19.htm" title="Quench not the Spirit.">1 Thessalonians 5:19</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-21.htm" title="Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.">1 Thessalonians 5:21</a> (see notes). Gifts of <span class="ital">prophecy</span> were possessed by various members of the Church, and men professing to speak “through Spirit”—i.e. under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit and by a supernatural influence—were declaring, “The Day of the Lord is come!”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Word” stands in contrast with “spirit,” just as “word of wisdom” and “of knowledge” with “prophecy,” and “doctrine” with “revelation,” in <a href="/context/1_corinthians/12-8.htm" title="For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;...">1 Corinthians 12:8-11</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/14-26.htm" title="How is it then, brothers? when you come together, every one of you has a psalm, has a doctrine, has a tongue, has a revelation, has an interpretation. Let all things be done to edifying.">1 Corinthians 14:26</a>. It denotes the ordinary expression of rational thought and judgement, in distinction from the ecstatic or prophetic utterances of supernaturally inspired persons.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“As from us”—strictly, <span class="bld">as through</span> (or <span class="bld">by</span>) <span class="bld">us</span>; the preposition is the same that has been used thrice already in the clause. But this phrase appears to qualify <span class="ital">epistle</span> alone, not <span class="ital">spirit</span> or <span class="ital">word</span>; for these latter modes of communication belonged to others besides the Apostle. It was <span class="ital">by letter</span> that his authorisation was claimed for the rumour in question. “As through us” signifies <span class="bld">as though on our authority</span>; comp. “through the Lord Jesus,” <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-2.htm" title="For you know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus.">1 Thessalonians 4:2</a>.—Was this opinion ascribed to the Apostle from misinterpretation of his previous letter, or of some other letter to the Thessalonians not preserved for us? or on the, authority of a pretended, or even forged Epistle? It is impossible to answer with certainty. His reference is vague, perhaps intentionally so. He surmised that his authority was being abused in this way, but possibly had no precise information on the point. If some members of the Church had not had the former Epistle communicated to them, as when writing <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-27.htm" title="I charge you by the Lord that this letter be read to all the holy brothers.">1 Thessalonians 5:27</a> he feared might happen, it may easily have been misrepresented, or misquoted, to the effect indicated. On the other hand, the fact that at the close of this Epistle (ch. <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-17.htm" title="The salutation of Paul with my own hand, which is the token in every letter: so I write.">2 Thessalonians 3:17</a>) he guards his readers against <span class="ital">imposture</span>, suggests to us that actual deceit was attempted; comp. the words of the next verse, “Let no one <span class="ital">cheat</span> you.” The authors of the false announcement must at least have hinted at the existence of another letter in their favour, if they wished to persuade those well acquainted with our First Epistle; for 1 Thessalonians lends no countenance to their views. A hint of this kind, brought to the Apostle’s knowledge, would put him at once upon his guard.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">as that the day of Christ is at hand</span>] Both reading and rendering are at fault here. <span class="ital">As that</span> is equal to <span class="bld">supposing that:</span> the agitation which the Apostle deprecates being such as this belief would naturally create. <span class="ital">Day of Christ</span> should be <span class="bld">day of the Lord</span>, as in <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-2.htm" title="For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so comes as a thief in the night.">1 Thessalonians 5:2</a> (see note), and elsewhere (<span class="ital">of Christ</span>, however, in <a href="/philippians/1-10.htm" title="That you may approve things that are excellent; that you may be sincere and without offense till the day of Christ.">Php 1:10</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-16.htm" title="Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither labored in vain.">Php 2:16</a>). And the verb means more than <span class="ital">is at hand</span>,—rather, <span class="ital">is now present</span> (R. V.), <span class="bld">is upon us</span>; under the same verb (in its participle) “things <span class="ital">present</span>” are contrasted with “things to come” in <a href="/romans/8-38.htm" title="For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,">Romans 8:38</a>, and <a href="/1_corinthians/3-22.htm" title="Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours;">1 Corinthians 3:22</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This enthusiastic Church, full of the thought of Christ’s heavenly kingdom, was ready to believe what it wished, and lent too credulous an ear to those who in such a time of spiritual tension and exaltation were sure to be found crying out, “Lo here!” or “Lo there!” Against this class of agitators the Lord warned His people. When He does return. He will have no need of heralds or forerunners; “For as the lightning shines out, flashing from the one side of heaven unto the other, so will the Son of Man be in His day” (<a href="/matthew/24-27.htm" title="For as the lightning comes out of the east, and shines even to the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.">Matthew 24:27</a>; <a href="/luke/17-14.htm" title="And when he saw them, he said to them, Go show yourselves to the priests.

It is, however, difficult to conceive how the Thessalonians could think that the day of the Lord was actually present. We cannot imagine that they thought that Christ had already come for judgment. To escape the difficulty, some conceive that "the day of the Lord" is not identical with "the coming of the Lord," but that, besides the actual advent, it includes the events which are its antecedents and concomitants (Eadie). It appears, however, best to suppose that the word is a strong expression for the imminence of that day; that the hour of the advent was about in strike. The Thessalonians ought always to be living in a state of preparation for the day of the Lord, as that day would come suddenly and unexpectedly; but they were not to be so impressed with a sense of its immediateness as to be deprived of their sober reason. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/2_thessalonians/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Shaken (&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)<p>From &#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; the tossing or swell of the sea.
